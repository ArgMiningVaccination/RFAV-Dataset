43951.1 This report of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) considers the public health implications of exposure to phytoestrogens in the diet.The report was drafted by a specially convened Working Group of the Committee with the followingterms of reference: \"To advise on the health implications of dietary phytoestrogens through review of published scientific research and the Food Standards Agency's phytoestrogen research programme.\" 1.2 In order to address these terms of reference, the Working Group considered the following key points: On the basis of current evidence, does ingestion of soy-based infant formula pose any risk for human infants? Are there health implications for other sub-groups of the population from the ingestion of dietary phytoestrogens? To consider the evidence for beneficial effects of dietary phytoestrogens. To make recommendations for further research. Structure of the report 1.3 The Working Group held a total of five meetings between April 2000 and March 2001. The Working Group considered peer reviewed published reports published up to 30 April 20021. Preliminary research reported in the form of meeting abstracts was not included unless the work was published in full, in apeer reviewed scientific journal by 30 April 2002. The Working Group acknowledged that anecdotal reports and reviews had been published expressing opinions on the health implications ofphytoestrogens. The Group considered these reports but concluded that such information could not be considered as objective or definitive evidence of adverse or beneficial effects of phytoestrogens.Therefore, the Group, where appropriate, noted such opinions but agreed it would not base any conclusions on the health implications of dietary phytoestrogens from this evidence. 1.4 A draft report was prepared by the Secretariat and Members of the Working Group and the report discussed at a series of four drafting group meetings from March 2001 to May 2002. The draft report wassubmitted to the COT for consideration in two parts at meetings held in February and July 2002. Somemodifications were made in light of Members' comments. 1.5 The report was issued for public consultation from October to December 2002. In addition, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition considered the evidence and conclusions presented in thereport relating to soy-based infant formula and provided an opinion.1. Executive summary 1Unpublished data from the FSA phytoestrogen research programme as well as studies received in press , which were considered by the Working Group prior to April 2002 and subsequently published have been included in the report.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 61.6 The Working Group considered the consultation submissions in January 2003 and further modifications were made to the report. Additional studies published after the literature cut-off date of 30 April 2002were identified in some submissions. These were considered by the Working Group and included in theredrafted report only if they substantially altered key issues or conclusions. The draft report wassubmitted to the COT for consideration and endorsement at a meeting held in February 2003. Details ofthe background to the Working Group and its methods of working are given in Chapter 2 of the report. 1.7 For the purposes of this report, the Working Group agreed a definition of a phytoestrogen as: any plant substance or metabolite that induces biological responses in vertebrates and can mimic or modulate theactions of endogenous oestrogens usually by binding to oestrogen receptors . Chapter 3 describes the chemical forms of the major phytoestrogens: the isoflavones, coumestans, lignans, and the prenylatedflavonoids. The analytical methods used to identify and measure phytoestrogens in foods and biologicalmatrices are also discussed in this chapter. In Chapter 4 , the sources and concentrations of phytoestrogens in food are described and assessments of dietary phytoestrogen exposure in adults andinfants are considered. 1.8 Chapter 5 reviews the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of phytoestrogens. The role of the gut microflora in the metabolism and bioavailability of phytoestrogens is discussed.Consideration is given to the transfer of phytoestrogens across the placenta from the mother to thefetus. Transfer of phytoestrogens to infants via breast milk is also discussed. 1.9 Phytoestrogens may cause oestrogenic effects by either interacting directly with oestrogen receptors or indirectly by modulation of endogenous oestrogen concentrations. Phytoestrogens may also inducenon-oestrogenic effects. The structure of oestrogen receptors and the way in which oestrogens orphytoestrogens interact with these cellular components to induce biological effects are reviewed inChapter 6 . The non-receptor mediated effects of phytoestrogens are reviewed in Chapter 7 . The experimental methods used to assess the oestrogenic activity of phytoestrogens and how these resultsmay be interpreted are described in Chapter 8 . 1.10 It has been shown that exposure to potent oestrogens during development can cause long-term adverse effects on human development and fertility, raising concerns that phytoestrogens may cause similareffects. The role of hormones in human sexual development and reproductive function is reviewed inChapter 9 . The effects of phytoestrogens on sexual development and reproductive function are also considered. 1.11 Concerns have been raised about potential effects of phytoestrogens on thyroid function. The current evidence and other potential interactions with the thyroid gland are discussed in Chapter 10 . The effects of phytoestrogens on the central nervous and immune systems are reviewed in Chapter 11 .71.12 There is growing interest in the use of phytoestrogens as alternatives to oestrogen replacement therapy for treatment of conditions such as osteoporosis and the menopause. There have also been manyreports on the cardioprotective effects of soy. The current evidence for the influence of phytoestrogenson these conditions is discussed in Chapters 12 , 13 and14. Consideration is given also to hormonal effects of phytoestrogens in men and premenopausal women. 1.13 Epidemiological data have indicated that a diet containing large amounts of soy, a rich source of isoflavones, may lower the risk of several types of malignant disease including hormone-dependentcancers. The influence of phytoestrogens on cancer is reviewed in Chapter 15 . 1.14 The advice and policy in the UK and other countries regarding soy-based infant formula is reviewed in Chapter 16 . 1.15 The information considered in Chapters 2 to 16 is summarised in Chapter 17 . Chapter 18 comprises the Working Group's conclusions on public health issues and recommendations for future research. Conclusions 1.16 The remit of the Working Group was to review phytoestrogens generally, rather than soy, specifically. However, the Working Group did consider the literature on soy to ensure inclusion of all relevantinformation. 1.17 Phytoestrogens are biologically active when administered to animals and humans and have been shown to elicit their effects viaa number of mechanisms: Interaction with oestrogen receptors (ER) to modulate the expression of oestrogen-responsive genes 2. Inhibition of enzymes involved in oestrogen biosynthesis and metabolism. Modulation of thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Inhibition of protein kinases and interaction with components of the cell cycle as well as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis pathways. Inhibition of topoisomerase. Antioxidant reactions. 2Some of the mechanisms outlined hereafter may also be dependent on ER activity.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 8Evaluation of risks and benefits of dietary phytoestrogens 1.18 Evaluation of the public health implications of phytoestrogens is complex as these compounds can elicit agonist and antagonist actions viathe oestrogen receptor and non-oestrogenic effects, which are age, tissue and gender dependent. There are also significant inter-species differences in ADME and timing ofsexual development making extrapolation of the effects seen in animals to humans complex. 1.19 Many of the reports on the benefits of consuming phytoestrogens are based upon observations in Eastern populations such as the Japanese and Chinese that have traditionally consumed soy. In addition,suggestions that dietary phytoestrogens do not pose significant health risks have been attributed to thelack of reports of adverse effects in these populations. However, it is uncertain whether data fromEastern populations can be extrapolated to Western populations, as there may be differences in howphytoestrogens are handled between such populations. 1.20 Given the level of complexity, the Working Group considered it inappropriate to evaluate the public health implications of phytoestrogens to the population as a whole or communicate the implications ina single statement. 1.21 An evaluation of the risks and benefits of dietary phytoestrogens is critically dependent on the nature, timing, conditions and extent of exposure. However, currently detailed intake data for the UK populationas a whole, or for specific subgroups of consumers, is very limited. 1.22 In vitro studies suggest that at physiological concentrations, interactions with oestrogen receptors are the primary cause of biological effects. In vivo studies support this view, as the principal biological effects observed on administration of phytoestrogens are similar to those of oestrogen and can beblocked by ER antagonists. Many experimental studies have used subcutaneous administration, whichcan significantly influence the biological activity of phytoestrogens. In addition, these studies, for themost part, use high concentrations of phytoestrogens. This makes interpretation difficult, as theseexperimental conditions are not equivalent to the level of dietary exposure in humans. 1.23 Many studies have used phytoestrogen-containing foods such as soy or flaxseed as a test material and assumed that phytoestrogens are responsible for the biological effects seen. However, it is impossible toexclude the possibility that there are other active components in these foods that could also contributeto the effects observed. Most research in the phytoestrogen field has focused on the isoflavones andthus, comparatively little is known about the prenylated flavonoids, coumestrol and lignans. Currentanalyses suggest that there are very few sources of prenylated flavonoids or coumestrol in the diet.However, the lignans are relatively common. Does ingestion of soy-based infant formula pose any risk for human infants? 1.24 In the UK, soy-based infant formulae have been used since the 1960s and are currently fed to approximately 1% of non-breast fed infants aged 4-10 weeks rising to approximately 2% of infants aged910-14 weeks. However, detailed information on the prevalence of, and reasons for, soy-based infant formula feeding is unavailable. 1.25 The concentration of phytoestrogens found in soy-based infant formulae is several orders of magnitude higher than that found in human breast milk. It has been estimated that intake by infants of isoflavonesfrom soy-based formulae is approximately 4 mg/kg body weight/ day. The Working Group concluded that infants fed soy-based formulae are the population subgroup exposed to the highest concentrationsof isoflavones and that exposure via breast milk is low by comparison. No data on the transfer of lignansfrom the maternal diet to breast milk have been published. 1.26 There is little published information to suggest that isoflavones affect thyroid function in infants fed soy- based formulae. However, the Working Group considered that isoflavones may lower free thyroxine concentrations. Although a normally functioning thyroid may compensate for this, by stimulatingthyroxine production, it is possible that infants with congenital hypothyroidism may be unable toincrease thyroxine production. These individuals may represent a small susceptible sub-group of thepopulation, therefore the Working Group recommends that physicians and other health care workers are made aware of the potential interactions between isoflavones in soy-based infant formulae and thyroidfunction. The Working Group advise that it is appropriate to monitor thyroxine levels in infants with congenital hypothyroidism who are fed soy-based infant formulae in order to establish the susceptibilityof this sub-group. 1.27 Few studies have examined the effect of isoflavones on the immune system. Studies in rodents have suggested that isoflavones may alter some parameters of immune function but the effects wereinconsistent. However, the Working Group considered that investigations of human infants fed soy-based formulae provide reassurance that phytoestrogens in soy do not have a significant impact on theintegrity of immune function in such children. 1.28 A recent study conducted in male neonatal marmosets suggests that feeding with soy-based infant formulae can alter some parameters of reproductive health during the neonatal stage. The WorkingGroup acknowledged that this work is still in progress, and therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made about likely human health implications. The Working Group advise that future findings from this work be evaluated fully once it has been completed. 1.29 Only a single study specifically examining the long-term health effects of soy-based formula feeding on sexual development and fertility in humans has been published. The Working Group considered that these data do not provide definite evidence for adverse clinical effects on sexual developmentor reproductive health, but noted the association between soy-based formula feeding and small increases in the duration and discomfort of menstruation. However, the study was based on recall anddid not include any direct measurements of hormone levels or other parameters in the subjects. TheWorking Group acknowledged that it was difficult to draw general conclusions from the results of a single study.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 101.30 The Working Group considered that the findings from these studies do not provide definitive evidence that phytoestrogens present in soy-based infant formulae can adversely affect the health of infants.However, the findings, together with those from studies on the mechanism of action and biologicalactivity of phytoestrogens reviewed in this Report, provide evidence of potential risks. For this reason,the Working Group expressed concern about the use of soy-based infant formulae. The Working Group noted that the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) expressed similar concern when considering evidence presented in this Report. SACN also considered there to be no substantive medical need for, nor health benefit arising from, the use of soy-based infant formulae. However, it was noted that soy-based infant formulae were the only vegan infant formula option available if babies were notexclusively breast fed 3. In light of the concerns expressed, the Working Group recommends that the Department of Health review current advice on the use of soy-based infant formulae. Are there health implications for other sub-groups of the population? 1.31 The Working Group considered that it was of more value to identify and characterise health implications in specific population groups rather than provide an overall evaluation for the general population. Atpresent, there are only limited data on the intake of phytoestrogens by specific population groups in theUK. However, those consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may ingest larger amounts of soy, anassumption supported by what intake data are available. The Working Group has identified a number ofpopulation subgroups that may be expected to have a higher than average intake of phytoestrogens: Vegetarians and vegans (isoflavones and lignans). Particular ethnic groups e.g. Japanese and Chinese (isoflavones). Consumers of soy-based foods (isoflavones). Consumers of phytoestrogen-containing dietary supplements (mostly isoflavones). 1.32 The Working Group noted the possibility that exposure among these sub-groups will vary due to the large inter-individual differences in metabolism and bioavailability of phytoestrogens and in particular,differences in gut microflora. Specific gut microflora are responsible for the conversion of daidzein tothe more potent oestrogen, equol. Thus, equol-producing individuals would be expected to be exposedto a greater oestrogenic potential than non-equol producers. 1.33 Dietary supplements containing phytoestrogens and soy-enriched foods are commercially available and are promoted as having beneficial health effects on human health. Phytoestrogen supplements aremarketed as 'natural' alternative treatments for a range of conditions including the menopause,osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and a number of cancers. Specific marketing for these conditionsmay lead to increased consumption within certain population sub-groups adding significantly toconsumer exposure. However, at present, it is not possible to estimate the impact on consumer 3Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition response to the COT Working Group on Phytoestrogens draft report on phytoestrogens & health (2003).11exposure, as few data on the phytoestrogen concentrations in or consumption patterns of these products are available. 1.34 Isoflavones and lignans can cross the placenta after metabolism in the mother. However, it is not known how the fetus metabolises these compounds and there are no published human studies examining thepotential effects of in utero exposure to phytoestrogens therefore, the implications of this exposure are unclear. The Working Group advise that further research be conducted to examine the implications of consuming a phytoestrogen-rich diet during pregnancy. 1.35 The Working Group identified individuals with hypothyroidism as a subgroup of potential concern. Consumption of phytoestrogen supplements, or a soy-rich diet, may provide sufficient concentrationsof phytoestrogens to interfere with thyroxine replacement therapy. Although no adverse effects inhypothyroid children or adults have been reported in the published literature, the Working Grouprecognised that research had not addressed this issue specifically. In view of the increasing availability of phytoestrogen-rich food and supplements in the UK, the Working Group recommend that research is conducted to monitor the plasma thyroxine levels of children and adults with hypothyroidism whoconsume large quantities of dietary phytoestrogens. 1.36 The Working Group also acknowledged the theoretical possibility that under circumstances in which the thyroid status of the mother is compromised, maternal exposure to high levels of phytoestrogens mayimpair normal development of the fetus. The Working Group recommend research is carried out to address this issue. 1.37 Despite the suggested benefits of phytoestrogens in lowering the risks of developing breast cancer, studies have shown that soy supplementation of the diet can induce oestrogen-responsive geneproducts in nipple aspirates in premenopausal women with breast disease. Although breast cellproliferation was not evident in this study, the Working Group suggested that until further research is carried out, women with oestrogen-dependent breast disease should be cautious in supplementing theirdiet with phytoestrogen-rich foods or dietary supplements. However, the Working Group considered that the data are insufficient to allow a quantitative recommendation so far as the phytoestrogen intakeof this population sub-group is concerned. 1.38 The Working Group considered an epidemiological study that suggested an association between high levels of consumption of soy-based foods and decreased cognitive function in a group of Japanese-American men and women. The Working Group concluded that this report did not provide sufficient evidence to confirm this association as the report lacked sufficient detail and the associations may haveresulted from inaccuracies in the methods employed. Evidence for beneficial effects of dietary phytoestrogens 1.39 Epidemiological data suggests a soy-rich diet is associated with a reduction in the risk of a number of conditions, including certain hormone-dependent diseases. However, the Working Group consideredCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 12many of these studies to be of limited value because they do not address specifically the roles of phytoestrogens. Any reported effects from such research therefore cannot be attributed with certaintyto phytoestrogens, as other biologically active components may be causally responsible for the effectsobserved. 1.40 In addition, many of the studies were short-term intervention studies in adults that did not address the possibility that exposure to phytoestrogens at an earlier age may influence the risk of disease later in life.Furthermore, a significant proportion of the research has been conducted in populations such as theJapanese and Chinese and thus, extrapolation of these results to the UK population may be confoundedby differences in lifestyle, diet, gut microflora, genetic make-up and ADME. Menopausal symptoms 1.41 Studies examining the effect of soy-based products or isoflavones to relieve menopausal symptoms are inconclusive. Some studies have suggested that soy may be beneficial, especially if basal intake is low, orthe vasomotor symptoms severe, but the data are equivocal, as positive results are often not statisticallysignificant and strong placebo responses are observed. Osteoporosis 1.42 Clinical data on the effects of phytoestrogens on bone density are limited but results of short-term human studies suggest small protective effects in the lumbar spine. The data for protective effects atother sites are equivocal. However, studies using rodent models of the menopause have consistentlydemonstrated that soy- or isoflavone-rich diets prevent bone loss. Large, long-term intervention studiesare required to evaluate these effects in humans. Cardiovascular disease 1.43 There is a considerable body of evidence to indicate that consumption of soy can have beneficial effects on low-density lipoproteins and total cholesterol levels. There have been attempts to attribute theseeffects to the isoflavones in soy. However, purified isoflavones appear not to produce the samebeneficial effects, and there is little evidence to suggest that this effect is associated with the isoflavonecomponent of soy. The Working Group noted that the US Food and Drug Administration reached similar conclusions when examining this issue. The effects of phytoestrogens on other factors important in therisk of cardiovascular disease such as blood pressure, thrombosis or atherosclerosis has not beenextensively investigated. 1.44 There is very little epidemiological data on lignans and cardiovascular disease. Such studies would be extremely difficult to design and conduct due to the prevalence of these compounds in fruitand vegetables. Cancer 1.45 The Working Group concluded that there is some evidence for beneficial effects of phytoestrogens on breast and prostate cancer based upon animal experiments. The findings in humans are less convincing.13This may be due, in part, to the much higher doses used in the animal studies. The interpretation of epidemiological studies is complicated by a number of confounding factors, including differences inlifestyle and diet and is constrained by the paucity of data on dietary intakes of phytoestrogens. 1.46 It has been suggested that exposure to oestrogens or phytoestrogens during development in utero , in infancy or in childhood may play an important role in the programming of hormonal homeostasis andinfluence the risk of developing cancer later in life. This may, in part, explain why the relatively low riskof certain cancers observed among migrant populations from the East (e.g. Chinese and Japanese)increases in subsequent generations. The Working Group recommends that in order to establish the clinical efficacy of phytoestrogens in these conditions in humans, long-term studies should beundertaken. Breast cancer 1.47 Studies examining the effect of isoflavones on breast cancer incidence are inconclusive. Prospective studies have failed to show significant associations between ingestion of soy or isoflavones and breastcancer incidence. Dietary intervention studies, using phytoestrogen supplements, have indicated changesin biomarkers that may be associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. Endometrial and ovarian cancer 1.48 A small number of studies have investigated the effects of phytoestrogens in these conditions and to date there is no evidence to support the suggestion that phytoestrogens have protective effects on theincidence of endometrial or ovarian cancer. Prostate cancer 1.49 Studies investigating the relationship between phytoestrogens and human prostate cancer are too few to draw conclusions and are limited to studies of soy. Experimental studies in rodents show that dietssupplemented with soy or isoflavones may inhibit the development of tumours of the prostate. Colorectal cancer 1.50 Epidemiological data suggests that consumption of non-fermented soy may lower the risk of colorectal cancer. In contrast, fermented soy products are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.No studies have specifically examined the effects of phytoestrogens. Data from rodent studies areconflicting and there is no firm evidence to suggest that phytoestrogens have beneficial effects on theincidence of colon cancer.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 14Stomach cancer 1.51 The evidence for protective effects of soy or isoflavones on stomach cancer in humans is inconclusive. Studies in Japanese and Chinese populations have shown higher rates of stomach cancer associated withfermented soy products. However, the high salt concentrations in such foods may contribute to thishigher incidence in these populations. Lung cancer 1.52 Epidemiological studies examining associations between phytoestrogen or soy intake and lung cancer in Chinese populations are inconclusive. Recommendations for future research 1.53 The Working Group recommends further research to address important outstanding issues and to aid future risk assessment of dietary phytoestrogens. The Working Group considered that future research should be conducted in humans where possible. The following research priorities were identified. Detailed exposure studies of discrete populations in the UK who ingest relatively large amounts of phytoestrogens, such as infants, vegetarians/vegans and users of phytoestrogen-rich foods andsupplements, would allow a more informed view of the health implications of phytoestrogens. TheWorking Group recommends that research examining the phytoestrogen content of food, as well as intakes of, and systemic exposure to, phytoestrogens is conducted. The extent and nature of soy-based infant formula use in the UK is uncertain. The Working Group recommends research to address these areas. The Working Group considers there is a need for further research on the potential effects of phytoestrogens in infants fed soy-based infant formulae. It may be possible to use established cohortsof infants fed soy-based formula to investigate the possible long-term health effects of exposure tophytoestrogens during infancy. The Working Group considers there is a need to investigate the potential interaction of phytoestrogens with the thyroid gland in subjects with compromised thyroid function. The Working Group recommends that further research be conducted to establish whether phytoestrogens act mainly by oestrogen receptor-mediated mechanisms or by alternativemechanisms.15 Large long-term prospective studies are necessary to establish the relationship between dietary phytoestrogens and the development of some diseases, specifically osteoporosis, breast cancerand prostate cancer. Shorter intervention studies are required to assess effects on menopausalsymptoms and risk markers of diseases, such as osteoporosis and cancers. Such studies shouldconsider an evaluation of the role of metabolites, especially equol, in the biological effects observed. The Working Group also identified supplementary areas for future research. The health implications of in utero exposure to phytoestrogens are unclear. There is a need for research to examine what effects maternal exposure to phytoestrogens may have on the fetus and onthe subsequent health status of the child. The potential for drug-phytoestrogen interactions has not been established. This is of potential importance for individuals consuming phytoestrogen dietary supplements while taking prescribeddrugs with hormonal effects. The potential differences in the metabolism of phytoestrogens between Western and Eastern populations has not been determined. Knowledge of the potential differences would aid assessmentof epidemiological studies.172.1 This report of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) has been prepared by the Working Group on Phytoestrogens (subsequently referredto as the Working Group). The Working Group was set up by the COT to review theavailable scientific literature and to determine whether dietary phytoestrogens had anyimplications on human health. Historical background 2.2 Phytoestrogens are a group of chemicals produced naturally by a number of edible plants (Mazur & Adlercreutz, 1998). In 1940, adverse effects on fertility were observed in animals that had been grazing onphytoestrogen-rich plants (Shutt, 1976). In the early 1980s, it became clear that phytoestrogens couldproduce biological effects in humans. As phytoestrogens are present in plant-based foods consumed byhumans, notably soy, this encouraged research into the chemical identity, concentrations and biologicalproperties of these compounds (Bingham et al , 1998). 2.3 The concentration of phytoestrogens in soy raised concerns that the adverse effects observed in animals could also occur in children who were fed soy-based infant formulae. It has been suggested that at thisearly stage in life, humans may be more sensitive to the effects of oestrogenic chemicals than adults(Sheehan, 1998). 2.4 To date, however, there have been no reports of adverse effects in human populations that have traditionally consumed soy. In fact, it has been suggested phytoestrogens can have beneficial effects onhuman health (Cassidy & Faughnan, 2000). For instance, it has been noted that the incidence of manyhormone dependent diseases, such as breast and prostate cancer, are lower in Eastern (e.g. Japanese)compared with Western populations (Adlercreutz & Mazur, 1997). It has been postulated thatcomponents of the Eastern diet are responsible for these differences and that in particular, the ingestionof phytoestrogen-rich foods is a major contributing factor to the lower incidence of hormone-dependent diseases (Adlercreutz & Mazur, 1997). 2.5 Foods and dietary supplements rich in phytoestrogens are marketed on the basis of their potential health benefits. In 2000, the value of the European market for isoflavones was estimated to be \u00a364million ( \u20ac106 million). Dietary supplements containing isoflavones are an expanding market and represent 9% of the phytonutrient market value. Research from market analysts predicts that thecombined phytonutrient market will increase to an estimated \u00a398 million ( \u20ac163 million) by 2008 (Frost & Sullivan, 2002). Exposure through dietary supplementation could increase individual exposure byorders of magnitude, however there is no information on consumption patterns or exposure estimatesfrom this source. 2.6 Following the concerns raised about dietary exposure to phytoestrogens, several independent scientific committees have considered the public health implications of phytoestrogens over the last ten years. In1992, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) Working Party on Naturally OccurringToxicants in Food identified that phytoestrogens had potential to cause adverse effects in humans.

IntroductionCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 18Working Party requested advice from the COT on the health implications of dietary phytoestrogens and in 1992, the COT reviewed the available toxicity data and reached the following conclusions: Phytoestrogens were capable of binding, albeit weakly, to human and animal oestrogenic receptors. Phytoestrogens may exert anti-oestrogenic effects. Because of adverse effects in animals, the concentration of phytoestrogens in soy milk products destined for consumption by infants should be analysed and monitored so that exposure data couldbe obtained. More data were needed to examine further the hypothesis that phytoestrogens are protective against breast cancer. Further evidence was required on the effects of phytoestrogens on luteinising and follicle-stimulating hormones and the possible health implications to women. 2.7 The COT reviewed the issue of phytoestrogens again in 1996, following concerns raised by the press and consumer interest groups about the potential adverse effects of soymilk products ingested by infantsand young children (COT annual report, 1996). 2.8 At this time, the COT estimated the intake of isoflavones from soy-based infant formulae to be approximately 4 mg/kg bw/ day during the first 4 months of life. This concentration was higher thanthose found to be associated with hormonal effects in premenopausal women. The Committeeexpressed concern over the potential for adverse effects, whilst acknowledging the lack of reportedadverse effects in populations habitually consuming large quantities of soy. The Committeerecommended that appropriate research be undertaken as a matter of high priority to determine ifingestion of soy-based infant formulae carries any risk for infants. The COT also noted that futureresearch may be necessary to consider the potential risk of soy products to other sub-groups of thepopulation (COT annual report, 1996). 2.9 The COT endorsed the advice of the Department of Health that breast and cows' milk formulae are the preferred sources of nutrition for infants. However, women who have been advised by their doctor orother health professionals to feed their baby soy-based infant formulae should continue to do so (COTannual report, 1996). 2.10 In the same year, the Food Advisory Committee (FAC) endorsed the COT recommendations for further research and recommended that, as a precautionary measure, manufacturers should investigate ways toreduce the levels of phytoestrogens in soy-based infant formulae (MAFF Food Surveillance Paper 51,1996). The FAC noted that foods eaten by other groups contain soy and the need for further actionwould be considered in the light of the outcome of the recommended research. Following the COT andFAC recommendations, MAFF commissioned a large programme of research into the health effects of19dietary phytoestrogens. The phytoestrogen research programme is now supported by the Food Standards Agency (Appendix 8). 2.11 In 1999, the Panel on Child and Maternal Nutrition (COMA annual report, 1999-2000) endorsed the FAC advice that, as a precautionary measure, infant formulae manufacturers should investigate ways toreduce the concentration of phytoestrogens in soy-based infant formulae. However, they noted that theclinical grounds for recommending a soy-based formula to parents were diminishing, as other moresuitable hydrolysates based on cows' milk were available. 2.12 In 1999, at the request of the Joint Food Safety and Standards Group of MAFF and the Department of Health, the COT reviewed a pre-publication study, which reported a higher incidence of hypospadias inboys born to women who followed a \"vegetarian\" 4diet during pregnancy (North & Golding, 2000). The authors suggested that the data lent support to the possibility of a deleterious effect of phytoestrogenson the developing male reproductive system. The Committee reviewed the data but concluded therewas insufficient evidence in the manuscript to support this hypothesis. The COT issued a statementstressing that there was no reason to change the existing advice concerning maternal diet in pregnancy(COT annual report, 1999a). 2.13 In 1999, the COT was also informed of work from the phytoestrogen research programme that showed that soy-based infant formulae could elicit oestrogenic effects in rodents. This study was subsequentlypublished as 'diet and the aetiology of temporal advances in human and rodent sexual development'(Ashby et al , 2000). At that time, the COT agreed that a Working Group be set up to conduct a comprehensive review of the health implications of dietary phytoestrogens (COT annual report, 1999b). Terms of Reference 2.14 The following terms of reference were agreed at the first meeting of the Working Group: \"To advise on the health implications of dietary phytoestrogens through review of published scientific research and the Food Standards Agency's Phytoestrogen Research Programme.\" 2.15 In order to fulfil this objective, the Working Group decided to address the following key points: On the basis of current evidence, does ingestion of soy-based infant formula pose any risk for human infants? Are there health implications for other sub-groups of the population from the ingestion of dietary phytoestrogens? 4The definition of vegetarian used in this study did not differentiate between vegetarian diets as defined by this report and ot her diets that included meat.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 20 To consider the evidence for beneficial effects of dietary phytoestrogens. To make recommendations for further research. Membership of the Working Group 2.16 The membership of the Working Group is given at Appendix 5. The issue is particularly complex and members were appointed with a broad range of expertise. 2.17 Professor Woods, a clinical pharmacologist and chairman of the COT between 1992 to 2002, chaired the Working Group. The Membership included expertise in chemistry, developmental biology,endocrinology, epidemiology, nutrition, paediatrics and toxicology as well as two public interestrepresentatives. Methods of Working 2.18 The first meeting of the Working Group was held on the 3 April 2000. The Working Group met on five occasions between April 2000 and March 2001. The Working Group was supported by a Secretariatcomprised of officials from the Food Standards Agency. 2.19 The Toxicology Unit at the Imperial College School of Medicine in London was contracted by the Food Standards Agency to prepare a number of literature reviews on the biological effects of phytoestrogens.This information was supplemented by additional papers prepared by Working Group Members and bythe Working Group Secretariat who reviewed the literature on a regular basis to update Members onsignificant new research. These papers were used as a basis for discussion at the Working Group meetingsand representatives from the Toxicology Unit were invited to present their papers to Members. A list ofsearch terms used to identify relevant literature is given at Appendix 3. A list of individuals who madepresentations to the Working Group is given at Appendix 4. 2.20 At the first meeting of the Working Group, Members agreed that only peer-reviewed published reports should be considered for inclusion in the review. Literature searches were conducted and the WorkingGroup agreed that literature published after April 2002 would not be considered 5. Preliminary research reported as meeting abstracts would not be included in the report if not published in full by 30 April2002. The Working Group acknowledged that anecdotal reports and reviews expressing opinions on thehealth implications of phytoestrogens had been published and submitted to the Group as evidence. TheWorking Group considered such information could not be considered as objective, definitive evidenceof adverse or beneficial effects of phytoestrogens. Therefore, the Group agreed, where appropriate, tonote such opinions but agreed it would not base any conclusions on the health implications of dietaryphytoestrogens from this evidence. Many of the studies considered have used phytoestrogen-containingfoods such as processed soy or flaxseed as a test material and assumed that phytoestrogens are 5Unpublished data from the FSA phytoestrogen research programme as well as studies received in press , which were considered by the Working Group prior to April 2002 and subsequently published have been included in the report.21responsible for the biological effects seen. However, it is impossible to exclude the possibility that there are other active components in such foods that could also contribute to the effects observed. 2.21 The Working Group invited additional information from other parties involved in the phytoestrogen field and placed an advertisement in the British Medical Journal on the 6 May 2000 and on the FoodStandards Agency's website. The Working Group received 17 submissions. A list of submissions receivedis given in Appendix 2. 2.22 The Working Group agreed to a request by the Food Standards Agency that the agendas, discussion papers and the minutes of meetings once cleared by the Chairman would be placed on the FoodStandards Agency's website. However, Members agreed that if evidence was submitted 'in confidence'from interested parties and groups, then the Working Group would observe the request forconfidentiality. 2.23 Members of the Working Group attended the Food Standards Agency phytoestrogen research workshop held in November 2000 in Cambridge. Eighteen project leaders presented unpublished data from thephytoestrogen research programme. A list of those that made presentations at the workshop is given atAppendix 4. The Working Group included this substantial body of unpublished data from the FoodStandards Agency's programme, in their considerations. A list of projects on phytoestrogens, which arefunded by the Food Standards Agency, is given at appendix 8. Published research from the phytoestrogenresearch programme is also included in this report. 2.24 A draft report was prepared by the Secretariat and Members of the Working Group and the report discussed at a series of four drafting group meetings from March 2001 to May 2002. The draft report wassubmitted to the COT for consideration in two parts at meetings held in February and July 2002. Somemodifications were made in light of Members' comments. The Membership of the COT is given atappendix 7. 2.25 The report was issued for public consultation from October to December 2002. The Working Group received comments from 43 individuals, groups or organisations. A list of the submissions received isgiven in Appendix 2. Comments on the draft report were also sought from an independent expert,Professor Steven Barnes, Professor of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Alabama, USA. Inaddition, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition considered the evidence and conclusionspresented in the report relating to soy-based infant formula and provided an opinion. 2.26 The Working Group considered the submissions in January 2003 and further modifications were made to the report. Additional studies published after the literature cut-off date of 30 April 2002 were identifiedin some submissions. These were considered by the Working Group and included in the redrafted reportonly if they substantially altered the key issues or conclusions. The draft report was submitted to theCOT for consideration and endorsement at a meeting held in February 2003.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 222.27 The conclusions set out in this report represent the opinion of the Working Group on Phytoestrogens and have been endorsed by the COT.

Endeavour. 1976, 35:110-113.23Chemical structures and nomenclature Introduction 3.1 Some naturally occurring compounds present in plants have been found to possess oestrogenic properties, these chemicals have been termed 'phytoestrogens'. The majority of phytoestrogens belongto a large group of substituted phenolic compounds known as flavonoids. Flavonoids are present in manyplants and it has been estimated that they can constitute up to 7% of the dry weight of some plants(Kuhnau, 1976). Three classes of flavonoid, the coumestans, prenylated flavonoids and isoflavones, arephytoestrogens that possess the most potent oestrogenic activity. A class of non-flavonoidphytoestrogens, the lignans has also been identified. The relationship between these types ofphytoestrogen and the names of the compounds most commonly found in food from these four groupsare summarised in Figure 3.1. 3.2 The Working Group has defined a phytoestrogen as: any plant substance or metabolite that induces biological responses in vertebrates and can mimic or modulate the actions of endogenous oestrogensusually by binding to oestrogen receptors . 3.3 Phytoestrogens possess oestrogenic properties due to their structural similarities to the hormone oestradiol. The structural similarities between members of the four main groups of phytoestrogenidentified above and oestradiol are shown in Figure 3.2. 3.4 Much of the work on phytoestrogens has focused on examining the concentration and biological activity of the isoflavones, coumestans, prenylated flavonoids and lignans. Although other phytoestrogens havebeen identified there are limited data on their biological properties and their concentrations in plantsand foods. The Working Group did not consider other sources of dietary oestrogens such asphytosterols or mycoestrogens 6.3. Chemistry and analysis of phytoestrogens 6Phytosterols were not considered by the Working Group as data on their oestrogenic properties are equivocal (Makela et al , 1995; Mellanen et al , 1996; Baker et al , 1999). The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) reviewed these studies and considered that the available evidence provided sufficient reassurance of the absence of endocrine effects of phytosterols viathe oral route of administration (SCF, 2000). Mycoestrogens were not considered as the health implications of these compounds have been evaluatedat both international and European levels by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives and the SCF, respectively.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 24Figure 3.1 The relationship between the various groups of phytoestrogens (given in bold) and members of each group.The compounds in brackets are not inherently present in plants but are oestrogenic products resulting frommetabolism of members of that class of phytoestrogen. This cannot be considered as an exclusive list asother phytoestrogens may be identified as constituents of food of phytoestrogens to oestradiol. The similarity of the structure of the human hormone, oestradiol and examples from the four classes ofphytoestrogen from Figure 3.1.

OH OHCH3 O OHOH roots and bark of some plants and trees (Shirataki et al, 1999; Bojase et al, 2001), are compounds of similar structure to isoflavones (although they possess an asymmetric carbon and thus the central ring is not flat but buckled) . Therefore, they may have oestrogenic properties. However, they have not been identified in food and their oestrogenic propertie s have not been established.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 26Isoflavones 3.5 The major isoflavones present daidzein glycitein biochanin A formononetin 3.6 Their chemical structures are shown in Figure 3.3. Biochanin A and formononetin are derivatives of genistein and daidzein that have an additional methyl (-CH 3) group. Isoflavones are often present as glucoside conjugates (glucones) in plants and foods. In addition, the glucose group is often esterifiedwith an acetyl- or malonyl group to form acetyl- or malonylglucosides (Barnes et al , 1994). The terminology used to describe isoflavones is summarised in Table 3.1. Table 3.1 Isoflavones most commonly found in foodstuffs. Aglucones isoflavones, as aglucones, glucones, acetylglucones and malonylglucones, most commonly found in food.

Conjugation to glucose, glucuronide or sulfate groups increases water solubility. Acetylation or malonylation of glucose conjugates andmethylation of the isoflavone moiety will alter water solubility. Chemical stability 3.8 Under acidic conditions, the glucones can be deconjugated to give aglucones. Whilst under acidic or basic conditions the acetyl- and malonyl groups can also be removed. In addition, malonyl groups candecarboxylate (lose CO 2) thus yielding acetyl groups. In the body, enzymes in the gut and liver can carry out these reactions during metabolism (see Chapter 5). Coumestans 3.9 Compared with isoflavones, coumestans have been less well studied. They are structurally similar to isoflavones and possess similar physical and chemical properties (Humfrey, 1998). The structure ofcoumestrol, the coumestan most commonly found in foods, is shown in Figure 3.4. Figure 3.4 The chemical structure of coumestrol, which has been identified in some foods. O OHOOH O CoumestrolCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 30Prenylated flavonoids 3.10 A number of prenylated flavonoids with oestrogenic have also been identified (Kitaoka al , 1998; Milligan The structures of these compounds are shown in Figure 3.5. These compounds are also structurally similar to the isoflavones but substituted with a prenyl group (B) and the phenol ring (A) is orientated ina different direction. The presence of the prenyl group makes these compounds less water soluble thanthe isoflavones.31Figure 3.5 The chemical structures and names of the prenylated flavonoids that have been found in food: 8-prenylnaringenin, 6-prenylnaringenin, xanthohumol and isoxanthohumol.The phenolic ring (box A) of these compounds is set in a different orientation to that found in isoflavonesand in addition they possess a prenyl group (box B) Lignans 3.12 Members of the lignan group of phytoestrogens are defined chemically as possessing the 2,3-substituted di-1,4-benzylbutane structure. The principal lignans identified Adlercreutz, 1988): lariciresinol isolariciresinol matairesinol secoisolariciresinol 3.13 The structures are shown in Figure 3.6. The form in which the lignans occur in foods is unknown but it has been suggested they are present as linked glucosides of differing chain length (Liggins et al , 2000). For this reason, isolation of these compounds from plants and foods requires chemical treatment afterwhich they are in the form of aglucones or glucosides (Mazur et al, 1996; Liggins et al, 2000). Lignans are thought not to be oestrogenic themselves, but are converted to the oestrogenic compoundsenterolactone and enterodiol by the OHCH3 CH3 OO O CH3CH38-Prenylnaringenin 6-PrenylnaringeninOO OH OH OH CH3 CH3BA CH3Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 32Figure 3.6 Structures and names of the lignans identified in lariciresinol, 3O OH OH OH OHOOH OHOOCH3 OHOH OH O OH C H 3 O HO O OH and analysis of phytoestrogens and their metabolites is particularly difficult given the similarity of structures and chemical properties, as well as the range of matrices in which they are found.Initially, phytoestrogens were analysed using insensitive techniques such as thin-layer and paperchromatography. However, the development of increasingly sensitive technologies has advancedphytoestrogen analysis considerably. These developments have been important as quantification ofphytoestrogens in foodstuffs as well as in pharmacological and toxicological studies are dependent onaccurate and precise analytical methodology. As a result, the information available on phytoestrogenconcentrations in foodstuffs and biological matrices has increased significantly in recent years and itmay be considered that studies conducted more recently have produced results of greater reliability. 3.15 Prior to analysis by physico-chemical methods, compounds must first be identified as phytoestrogens i.e. as having potential oestrogenic activity. Assays to measure the oestrogenic activity of plant and foodextracts have been developed and are discussed in Chapter 8. Physico-chemical methods can thenseparate and quantify these oestrogenic constituents present in the extract. The principal physico-chemical methods for separation and quantification of phytoestrogens, are described below. Isolation of phytoestrogens 3.16 Phytoestrogens and their metabolites are generally present in parts per billion to parts per million concentrations in plants, solid and liquid foodstuffs as well as in biological matrices such as plasma,serum, urine and faeces. The concentrations of phytoestrogens present in plants and foods are describedin Chapter 4 and concentrations in biological matrices are described in Chapter 5. 3.17 Phytoestrogens must be isolated from the major constituents of these matrices before quantification. The type of matrix, phytoestrogen and the analytical method determine which isolation or extractionprocedures are required. Extraction of phytoestrogens is usually not 100% efficient. To correct for losses,internal standards that have similar chemical properties to the analytes are added to the sample inknown quantities prior to extraction. The ratio of the internal standard to the analyte is measured duringanalysis to make this correction. A general scheme of the steps involved in preparing a sample foranalysis is shown in Figure 3.7.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 34Figure 3.7 An outline of the principal steps involved in the extraction and analysis of phytoestrogens. Analytical methods 3.18 The most widely used techniques for measurement of phytoestrogens are: reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS)Food or biological sample Add internal standard Extraction with organic solventAcid hydrolysisEnzymatic extraction Extraction with organic solvent Chromatographic separation Analysis353.19 The most appropriate analytical method is dependent on the type of biological matrix and compound to be analysed. The analytical methods used in phytoestrogen analysis require reference standards,which are pure samples of the analyte and are used to validate and calibrate the analytical method(Thompson & Wood, 1993). As methods have developed, the limits of detection and quantification havedecreased so that phytoestrogens can now be measured in foodstuffs and biological samples down toconcentrations of parts per billion. High performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) 3.20 HPLC-UV is a relatively rapid way of measuring phytoestrogens (Setchell & Welsh 1987; al Murphy et al, 1999; Zhang et al, 1999; Nakamura et al, 2000; Griffith & Collison, 2001; Thomas et al, 2001). Following isolation of phytoestrogens from the matrix, they are directly separated and quantified. Thismethod allows simultaneous purification and measurement of complex mixtures. UV detection isgenerally less sensitive than MS detection and the reported detection limits can be variable. The analytesare quantified by comparison with calibration curves derived from reference standards. However,substances present in the sample, but not in the reference standard, which may co-elute with the analyteduring chromatography, may lead to falsely high measurements of the analyte. Reference standards arenot available for many phytoestrogens, such as the acetyl- and malonyl isoflavone glucosides. Therefore,measurements of these on calibration curves of isoflavone glucosides andaglucones. Research indicates that this approach could introduce errors in measurements (Coward et al, 1993). However, when reference materials of the acetyl- and malonylglucosides are available suchassumptions can be tested and results re-calculated. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) 3.21 GC-MS is sufficiently sensitive to measure concentrations of phytoestrogens of less than parts per million (Adlercreutz et al, 1991a and et al 1999; Heinonen et al, 1999; Foster et al , 2002). Measurement is done with the use of internal standards, preferably isotopically labelled analogues of the analytes. Samples must be treated to remove conjugating groupsprior to analysis by GC-MS. As a result, phytoestrogens cannot be measured as conjugates as they mayappear in the matrix and the method is more time consuming than HPLC-UV. As such, the analyticalresults obtained using this method are measurements of hydrolysed phytoestrogens, usually expressedas a quantity of 'total phytoestrogen'. Chemical and enzymatic methods have been developed to removethese groups (Liggins et al , 1998; Mazur et al , 1996). Enzymatic methods are preferable for isoflavones as they can be unstable under acidic conditions (Liggins et al, 1998). However, lignan glucosides are resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis and require strong acid to remove the sugars (Mazur et al , 1996).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 36Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS) 3.22 LC-MS is also sufficiently sensitive to measure concentrations of phytoestrogens of less than parts per million (Setchell & Welsh, 1987; Barnes et al, 1994; 1999; et al, 2000a and b; Rong et al, 2000; Chang et al , 2000). However, in contrast to GC-MS, removal of conjugating groups is not required prior to analysis. Therefore, different forms of phytoestrogens can be measured and expresseddirectly rather than as a value of 'total phytoestrogen'. However, measurement is dependent on theavailability of standards for each analyte and many of these materials are unavailable at present.Laboratories using LC-MS have to use the available aglucone standards and hydrolyse samples prior toanalysis. As such, the advantage of non-destructive sample preparation that LC-MS offers over GC-MShas not yet been realised. More recently, methods using LC coupled to mass spectrometers in tandem(MS/MS) have been developed for the analysis of phytoestrogens (Coward et al , 1996; 2002; Fang et al , 2002). The specificity of tandem MS/MS systems allows direct injection of biological fluids such as urine, although plasma may need to be treated to removeprotein before injection. Additionally, this method allows some structural characterisation of theanalyte. Importance of reference and internal standards 3.23 The analytical methods described above are dependent on reference standards and the accuracy of the MS-based methods may be improved by use of isotopically labelled internal standards. In the past,analysis of many phytoestrogens has been hindered by the lack of analytical standards (Song et al, 1998). 3.24 Reference standards have been isolated from natural sources (Farmakalidis & Murphy, 1985) or chemically synthesised (Adlercreutz et al , 1998). Synthetic routes to reference compounds are advantageous as pure, fully characterised compounds canbe supplied in large quantities and used to incorporate isotopic labels, including heavier versions ofhydrogen (deuterium [ 2H]) or carbon (carbon-13 [13C]). 3.25 Genistein, equol 2H labels 2H labels are introduced by exchanging hydrogens present in the compound with 2H, but these are unstable and can re-exchange with hydrogen (1H) during analysis, especially under acid conditions, which would lead to an overestimate of the analyte concentration (Adlercreutz et al & Rasku, 1997). The Food Standards Agency's research programme has funded projects to developmethods to synthesise phytoestrogens incorporating stable 13C-labels. These labels have been introduced into genistein, daidzein and formononetin both as single (Whalley et al, 1998) and triple labels and supplied to the laboratories undertaking analysis in the Food Standards Agency research programme.The research programme also investigated the preparation of labelled standards by growingphytoestrogen-rich plants in an atmosphere enriched with 13CO2(Bluck et al , 2002). However, the synthetic approach has proved more successful and has produced large quantities of labelled andunlabelled material.373.26 The lack of standards of phytoestrogen metabolites has limited quantification of these compounds in biological samples. Thus, little is known about the concentrations of conjugated and unconjugatedphytoestrogens in plasma, urine and faeces. As such, much of the analysis of phytoestrogens in thesematrices is preceded by deconjugation and concentrations are expressed as 'total phytoestrogen'.However, labelled antibodies raised against genistein, daidzein and enterolactone have been developed. Quantification is achieved using competitive assays incorporating fluorescent- or radio-labelled Wang et al , 2000). These assays are equally as sensitive as, but less time consuming and expensive than, GC- or LC-MS based methods and allow rapid analysis of large numbers of samples (Uehara et al , 2000). However, the antibodies are not completely specific and cross-react with other phytoestrogens (Adlercreutz et al, 1998; Wang et al , 2000). They may also cross-react with other similar compounds, such as steroids, in biological samples. Quality assurance (QA) 3.28 As phytoestrogen analysis is a difficult and developing area it was considered important to assess the various analytical methods employed in the Food Standards Agency's phytoestrogen researchprogramme. The programme initiated a pilot QA scheme and the results from the participatinglaboratories were found to be in satisfactory agreement. The Food Standards Agency is currentlysupporting a further QA scheme. Key points The four principal groups of phytoestrogens in possess oestrogenic to their structural similarities to the hormone, oestradiol. Measuring the concentrations of phytoestrogens in food and biological samples is difficult. Early studies have used inappropriate standards and may have reported inaccurate analytical results.Methods of phytoestrogen analysis have improved as interest in these compounds has grown.Consequently, it may be considered that studies conducted more recently have produced resultsof greater reliability.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 38 It will not be possible to quantify many of the different forms of phytoestrogens as they occur in food and biological samples until methods to synthesise internal and reference standards of thesecompounds have been developed. The Food Standards Agency's research programme has developed and improved analytical methods. This has included the synthesis of reference and internal standards and QA schemes for phytoestrogenanalysis. References Adlercreutz H, Musey G, Hase T.

J Nutr. 1999,129:957-962.45Sources of phytoestrogens in food 4.1 The principal phytoestrogens food are the isoflavones, coumestans, prenylated flavonoids and lignans (see Chapter 3). The main classes of phytoestrogen and common dietary sources are shown in Table 4.1,which suggests only the isoflavones and lignans are commonly found in the UK diet. 4.2 The provision of accurate data on the phytoestrogen content of different foodstuffs has been hampered by the lack of suitable analytical methods and validation techniques (see Chapter 3). For this reason, it ispossible that other phytoestrogen compounds present in food have not been detected. 4.3 Until recently most of the available information on dietary phytoestrogen concentrations related to isoflavone aglucones. This is due to the limitations in the analytical methods used (see Chapter 3). Dataon the concentrations of isoflavone glucosides, coumestans and lignans in food are more limited (Reinli& Block, 1996). Table 4.1 Classes of phytoestrogens and common dietary sources. Phytoestrogen class Example of dietary and alfalfa Sources and concentrations of phytoestrogens in foods and estimated dietary intakeCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 46Isoflavones 4.4 The most prevalent dietary isoflavones include genistein, daidzein, glycitein, biochanin A and formononetin. These compounds are primarily found in legumes where they occur as glucosides.Soybeans and soy-based foodstuffs are a particularly rich source of isoflavones, especially genistein anddaidzein and to a lesser extent glycitein, whereas biochanin A and formononetin are generally lessprevalent in soy and are found mostly in clover and alfalfa sprouts (Bingham et al , 1998). Coumestans 4.5 The coumestans, of which coumestrol is the most common form, are structurally related to the isoflavones. They have been found in high concentrations in clover and fresh alfalfa sprouts (Humfrey et al, 1998). Lignans 4.6 Lignans are a class of phytoestrogens that exist as minor constituents in many cereals, vegetables and fruit. The highest concentration of these compounds (such as matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol), arefound in foodstuffs such as grains, seeds and other fibre rich foods. Linseed (flaxseed) is the richestknown source of lignans (Morton et al , 1997; Beecher, 2000). Prenylated flavonoids 4.7 The prenylated flavonoids are a class of phytoestrogens also structurally related to the isoflavones. These compounds have been found in high concentrations in hops. The most common forms of thesecompounds are 6-prenylnaringenin, 8-prenylnaringenin, xanthohumol and isoxanthohumol (Milligan et al, 1999). Variability of phytoestrogen concentrations in plants 4.8 There is considerable variation in the phytoestrogen concentrations of different plants. The concentrations of these compounds can be influenced by a number of factors including plant species,strain, crop year and geographical location (Eldrige & Kwolek, 1983; Wang & Murphy, 1994a). An exampleof how these factors can influence the concentration of isoflavones in soy plants is shown in Table 4.2.47Table 4.2 Factors affecting isoflavone concentrations in soy plants. From Wang & Murphy (1994a) Effect of plant species 4.9 Phytoestrogen concentrations can vary considerably between plant species. For example, concentrations of isoflavones varied from undetectable levels to g/kg concentrations in 37 species of plants used infoodstuffs (Franke et al, 1995). Variation in the concentrations of isoflavones present in different species of soybean seed (i.e. hulls removed) are shown in Table 4.3. Table 4.3 Variability of isoflavone concentrations between soybean seeds and black soybean seeds. Modified after Franke et al (1995) Effect of plant strain 4.10 Concentrations of phytoestrogens also vary significantly between strains of the same plant. Differences in total isoflavone concentration of 2- to 3-fold have been observed between soybean strains grownunder similar conditions (Eldrige & Kwolek, 1983; Wang & Murphy, 1994a). 4.11 The chemical form of phytoestrogen is also variable within soybean strains. However, the order of compound prevalence in the strains remains the same. Of eleven varieties of soybean analysed the orderof isoflavone concentration was shown to be: genistein derivatives. Of these malonyldaidzin, genistin and daidzin derivatives were the mostprevalent forms. Comparisons between strains of Japanese and American soybeans have shown that theJapanese variety have higher ratios of malonylgenistin: genistein and malonyldaidzin: daidzein (see Table4.4). However, American significantly higher strain (n= 7) 2053-4216 Crop year (1989-91) 1176-3309Location in which crop was grown (n= 4) 1176-1749Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 48Table 4.4 Ratios of malonylglucoside: glucoside concentration in American after Wang & Murphy (1994a). Environmental effects 4.12 Environmental conditions can influence the concentrations of phytoestrogens present in plants (Eldrige & Kwolek, 1983; Wang & Murphy, 1994a). It has been shown that isoflavone concentrations can vary by 2-fold when a particular strain of soybean is grown in different locations in a single year and up to 3-foldwhen grown in the same location over a number of years. However, while the concentration of individualisoflavones is variable, there appears to be little fluctuation in the ratios of genistein, daidzein andglycitein (Wang & Murphy, 1994a). Concentrations of phytoestrogens in foods 4.13 The United States Department of Agriculture and Iowa State University have established a database of isoflavone concentrations in foodstuffs. The database is a compilation of internationallypublished scientific literature on the concentrations of isoflavones in food and is updated whennew studies are published. Before new information is included in the database, the analyticalmethodology is evaluated and compared to a reference method (Murphy et al , 1997). A confidence code (a-c) is then assigned which provides an indication of the data quality ('a' indicates considerablereliability). The concentrations of isoflavones are presented as 'total aglucone'. This is obtained byconverting the glucoside figures into aglucone values. The dry weight values are converted intowet weight either by using given moisture content or by assuming a commonly expected moisturecontent for that particular food. The database is published on the Internet at the website address:http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/isoflav/isoflav.html 4.14 The information from this database indicates that the most prevalent isoflavones present in foodstuffs are genistein and daidzein. Formononetin, biochanin A and glycitein are also present in foodstuffs but toa lower extent and often at undetectable levels.Soybean strain Malonylglucoside : glucoside ratio daidzein were also the most prevalent phytoestrogens in a database of the phytoestrogen content of foodstuffs based on data from the Health Habits and History Questionnaire (HHHQ), adietary assessment questionnaire widely used in cancer research (Pillow et al , 1999). 4.16 Soy is recognised as the major dietary source of Fukutake et al , 1996). Soy- based products have been shown to contain significant quantities of total isoflavones with soybeans andsoy flour containing the highest quantities (14-153 mg/100g and 131-198 mg/100g, respectively).Fermented soy products including miso and tempeh also contain high concentrations of totalisoflavones (29 - 53 mg/100g) (see Table 4.5). 4.17 Fruits, vegetables, nuts and cereals are all minor sources of isoflavones (Liggins et al, 2000a and b; 2002). 4.18 Of the other common phytoestrogens, the highest concentrations of coumestrol have been found in clover (5611 mg/kg) and alfalfa sprouts (720 mg/kg) (Franke et al 1995). The highest concentrations of lignans have been found in grains and seeds, in particular linseed (600 - 3700 mg/kg), and other fibrerich foods (Bingham et al, 1998; Mazur Adlercreutz, 1998; Morton et al, 1997; Meagher & Beecher, 2000).

For example, fermentation of soy into products such as tempeh, miso and bean paste reduces the isoflavone content by between 2- to 3-fold when comparedto non-fermented soy foods (Wang & Murphy, 1994b). Also, the aglucone is the predominant form ofisoflavone present in fermented products whereas in non-fermented foods glucosides are the mostprevalent form (see Table 4.6). Table 4.6 Isoflavone concentrations in fermented, non-fermented and second-generation food products. Modified after Coward et al (1993) nd - not detected 4.20 Cooking has also been shown to reduce phytoestrogen concentrations and alter the chemical form of phytoestrogens present in foodstuffs. For example, boiling vegetables in water causes a decrease in thedaidzein and genistein content, presumably due to loss in the water, and during roasting of soybeans,malonylglucosides are rapidly converted into acetylglucosides (Wang & Murphy, 1994b; Coward et al , 1998; Liggins et al, 2000b). However, baking or frying does not appear to alter the total isoflavone content of foodstuffs (Coward et al , 1998). 4.21 The isoflavone content of 'second-generation' soy foods, i.e. foods made by the addition of soy ingredients (primarily soy protein isolate), is further decreased as only a percentage of the productcomes from soy (see Table 4.7). Soy ingredients are often used to replace animal protein and/ or toreduce the fat content of foods. Hence the phytoestrogen content of these products is higher whencompared with the traditional meat based products.Food Glucoside Genistein Daidzein Soy milk 1.68 1.34 0.10 0.14 Tofu 1.22 0.59 0.15 0.08 Tempeh 0.30 0.10 0.43 0.05 Soy cheese 0.06 0.04 0.005 0.001Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 52Table 4.7 Factors affecting isoflavone concentrations in soy derived foods. Calculated from Wang & Murphy (1994b) Concentrations of isoflavones in infant foods Concentrations of isoflavones in infant formula 4.22 The concentration of isoflavones present in various types of infant formulae was determined. Samples of cows' milk formula (n=3), soy-based formulae were usingHPLC-UV. Isoflavones were detected in all samples of soy-based infant formula. The concentration oftotal isoflavones present, expressed as aglucone/L formula as fed, ranged from between 18-41 mg.Isoflavones were not detected in any of the brands of cows' milk formula analysed (MAFF FoodSurveillance Information Sheet 167, 1998). There have been no reports of changes to the isoflavonecontent of soy-based infant formulae. Thus, these concentrations probably reflect the levels ofisoflavones in the formulae currently used. Concentrations of isoflavones in weaning and soy-containing family foods 4.23 Isoflavone concentrations have been analysed in samples of commercial weaning foods (n= 6) and samples of soy-containing family food (n= 11) 'as consumed' (see Table 4.8). The commercial soy-containing weaning foods contained 18-78 mg total isoflavones/kg food whereas in soy-containingfamily foods the concentrations were in the range of 29-275 mg total isoflavones/kg food (MAFF reportFS2829).

Generally, the highest concentrations of total isoflavones were detected in the breastmilk of mothers who followed a vegetarian or vegan diet. The highest concentration detected, ( /H1101132 ng total isoflavone/g), was from an individual following a vegan diet, (corresponding to approximately 0.032mg total isoflavone/L breast milk). This figure is orders of magnitude less than the concentrationspresent in soy-based infant formula (18-41 mg total isoflavones/L made up formula) (MAFF reportFS2829). Similar findings have been reported by Franke et al (1998) and Irvine et al (1998). Table 4.9 Total isoflavones in milk from breast feeding mothers. Adapted from MAFF report FS2829 Phytoestrogen intakes from the UK diet 4.25 Estimates of mean phytoestrogen intake from the UK diet are available from a total diet study (TDS) carried out in 1982 and 1987. The estimates were based on twenty dietary groups of foodstuffs andincluded: carcass meat, offal, meat products, poultry, fish, oils and fats, potatoes, milk, dairy products,eggs, bread, miscellaneous cereals, nuts, sugar and preserves, fruit products, beverages, green vegetables,other vegetables, canned vegetables and fresh fruit. 4.26 The foodstuffs were analysed 'as consumed' for isoflavones and coumestans using reversed phase HPLC- UV (LOD = 0.02 mg/kg). None of the dietary groups had a detectable isoflavone content soit was estimated that the average total isoflavone consumption in the UK was likely to be less than1 mg/person/ day. This is in agreement with estimated isoflavone intake ( /H110211 mg/ day) reported by Jones et al (1989). However, given that industry sources have estimated approximately 60% of processed foods currently in British supermarkets contain soy products, it is speculated that the 1987 TDS underestimatesthe mean intake of phytoestrogens in the UK (ENDS Report, 1996). 4.27 Wiseman et al (2002) investigated the isoflavone content of soy containing foods. The findings indicated that isoflavone concentrations correlated with soy content of the foods.Breast Feeding Total isoflavones in breast milk (/H9262g aglucone/kg) Mother's Mean Range (n= (n= 14) 4 1-10 Vegan (n= 11) 11 2-32Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 544.28 Typical weight and portion size data are available for the average weights of both individual food items and average portion sizes of food eaten in the UK. The energy and nutrients in portions of foods andtherefore the intake in a typical meal can be calculated. Table 4.10 shows approximate concentrations ofisoflavones in some soy-based foods in commonly eaten portion sizes. 4.29 Certain sections of the UK population, including infants fed soy-based infant formulae, different ethnic populations, vegetarians and vegans or those consuming diets rich in soy foods may be exposed to higherconcentrations of dietary phytoestrogens than the average consumer. 4.30 In 2001, the Phytoestrogen Working Group Secretariat, in collaboration with the FSA Consumer Exposure Analysis Team (CERT), prepared an assessment of isoflavone intake in the UK. The assessment was basedon data collated from National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) 1986-87 and the Dietary Survey ofVegetarians (DSV) 1994-95. The DSV included people who ate fish. The mean exposure to totalisoflavones was estimated for consumers of soy and soy-containing foods in UK adults (n= 2197) and UKadult vegetarians (n= 415). Mean exposure was estimated at 0.6 and 2.6 mg/person/ day for the totalpopulation and vegetarians, respectively. Table 4.10 Examples of dietary sources of isoflavones and lignans in average portion sizes*. *Adapted from the USDA-Iowa State University Isoflavone Database (1999); Thompson et al (1991); Cassidy & Faughnan (2000), using average portion sizes from Crawley (1992). 4.31 It should be noted that the estimate was based on dietary surveys that were conducted several years ago and the general eating patterns of the UK population have changed and the availability and use of soyand soy-containing foods has increased in recent years. Analysis of the 1998 Total Diet Study shows soyisoflavones are present in foods such as bread, meat and fish products. The ratio of isoflavoneconcentrations in these products suggests that soy is introduced during processing. This suggests thatconsumption of soy and therefore, exposure to isoflavones, for both the whole population and forFood Total isoflavones (mg) Food Lignans (mg) Soybeans 25-143 Linseed (flaxseed) 13.5 Soybean flour 0.8-59 Oat bran 0.2 TVP 29-67 Asparagus 0.5 Tofu 19 Carrot 0.2 Tofu yoghurt Broccoli 0.2 Tempeh 4-38 Lentils 0.7 Miso 4-16 Pear 0.3 Soy sauce - Sweet potato 0.4 Soy cheese 1-24 Kidney bean 0.2 Soy milk 3-53 Leek 0.255vegetarians may now be significantly higher than estimated by the 1986-7 and 1994-5 dietary surveys (ENDS Report, 1996; Clarke et al , 2003). Estimated dietary intake of isoflavones by vegetarians 4.32 It has been estimated that up to 5% of the UK population does not eat fish or meat and follows a vegetarian diet. A 7-day duplicate dietary study was carried out in UK vegetarians to determine thedietary intake of a number of inherent natural toxicants, metals and other chemical contaminants. Thesamples were analysed by LC-MS (Clarke et al , 2003). 4.33 The study participants were asked to collect an exact duplicate of all food consumed over a 7-day period. Dietary exposures were calculated from the concentrations of isoflavones in the duplicate dietsamples, the weights of the samples and the weights of the study participants. 4.34 The UK vegetarian duplicate diet study gave an estimated intake of 12 mg isoflavone/ day, which is considerably higher than the mean value calculated for vegetarians in the 2001 assessment. 4.35 The results may be taken as an indication of isoflavone intake by vegetarians, however the figures should be treated with caution, as the number of subjects used for intake estimation was small (n= 35). The studyset out to gather data from 100 subjects but only data from 35 subjects were used in the final intakeestimate because diets were poorly characterised by many of the participants (see Table 4.11). Table 4.11 Estimate of dietary daidzein and genistein intake from an UK vegetarian diet. Adapted from Clarke et al (2003) Estimated dietary intake of isoflavones by vegans 4.36 Only one estimate of isoflavone intake by vegans is available (see Table 4.12).

The mothers were requested to record both their infant'sfood intake and their own consumption of isoflavone rich foods. A checklist of isoflavone rich foods wasprovided (MAFF report FS2829). 4.38 An estimation of the intake of isoflavones by breast feeding mothers on the various diets is shown in Table 4.12. It should be noted however, that these figures are only an indication of intake as theisoflavone content of the foodstuffs were derived mainly from calculated estimates rather thananalytical data. Furthermore, restricted dietary details were provided (i.e. only foods rich in isoflavoneswere recorded) therefore the intake figures may underestimate the intake of dietary isoflavones by thesemothers. Table 4.12 Intake of isoflavones by breast feeding mothers in the UK. Adapted from MAFF report FS2829 Estimated dietary intake of isoflavones by infants 4.39 The estimated mean intake of total isoflavones from soy-based infant formula has been estimated to range from 5 mg isoflavone/kg bw/ day for 1-2 month old infants to 4.5 mg isoflavone/kg bw/ day for 4-6 month old infants (MAFF Food Surveillance Information Sheet 167, 1998). 4.40 Other studies, however, have indicated that isoflavone consumption by infants could potentially be higher. Setchell et al (1998) estimated that 4-month old infants (n= 7) fed soy-based infant formula would be exposed to between 4.5 - 8 mg isoflavones/kg bw/ day of total (free and conjugated) isoflavones. ASwiss study by Rupp et al (2000) estimated that infants up to 5 months of age would be exposed to between 3-13 mg isoflavones/kg bw/ day whilst infants older than 5 months were estimated to beexposed to a maximum of 20 mg isoflavones/kg bw/ day. In addition, Murphy et al (1997) reported consumption in the range of 5-12 mg isoflavones/kg bw/ day.Mother's Diet Total isoflavone intake Range (n= 13) 0 0 Vegetarian (n= 13) 7 0-70 Vegan (n= 11) 75 30-15057Phytoestrogen intake in consumers of health food supplements 4.41 A large number of health food supplements that contain phytoestrogens are marketed in the UK. They are marketed for a wide range of conditions such as 'natural alternatives to hormone replacementtherapy', breast enhancement and osteoporosis. 4.42 In response to concerns raised by the Food Commission, the Food Standards Agency commissioned an analysis of the phytoestrogen content of a dietary supplement that is claimed to promote 'natural breastenhancement'. The analysis did not detect the presence of genistein, daidzein, coumestrol, matairesinol,secoisolariciresinol or anhydrosecoisolariciresinol. However, the supplement to contain 8-prenylnaringenin and possibly 6-prenylnaringenin, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol and trace levels ofglycitein. These phytoestrogens are found in hops, a stated ingredient on the supplement label (Coldham& Sauer, 2001). 4.43 A report from New Zealand has shown that the concentrations of phytoestrogens in dietary supplements vary according to the food source. The highest concentrations recorded were approximately 29 mgisoflavones/ day at the manufacturers' recommended daily dose (Taylor & Burlingame, 1998). 4.44 The isoflavone content of fifteen different soy-based supplements available on the market was analysed using HPLC (Nurmi et al , 2002). The report found only one supplement actually contained the same amount of isoflavones as stated by manufacturers on the product label. In general isoflavone contentwas found to be lower than the value given on the product labels and total isoflavone content rangedfrom 0.1-201 mg/g per tablet (Nurmi et al , 2002). A study by Setchell et al (2001) also reported considerable differences in the phytoestrogen content of dietary supplements (n= 33) from that statedby the manufacturers. Similar findings were reported by Howes & Howes (2002) who reported 6/10supplements analysed had concentrations significantly below that stated on the label. 4.45 The Food Standards Agency carried out analysis of a range of phytoestrogen dietary supplements available in the UK (n= 51). This analysis also showed that phytoestrogen content varied widely betweenproducts with many of the supplements analysed containing less than the stated content of totalphytoestrogens (unpublished results). Concentrations of phytoestrogens ranged from 0.01-35 mg/gsupplement. If the manufacturers' recommended daily dosage is taken, the highest isoflavoneconcentrations consumed could be approximately 88 mg isoflavones/ day. From this value, the estimatedexposure of isoflavones from this supplement for a 60 kg adult is 1.5 mg/kg bw/ day. Phytoestrogen intake in other countries 4.46 Dietary phytoestrogen intake is dependent on the type and composition of the foodstuffs consumed by different populations. Soybeans have, for many centuries, played an integral part in some Asian culturesboth as a foodstuff and as a medicine (Messina, 1995). However, feeding of soy, including soy-based infantformula, to infants in the first 4-6 months of life has not been traditional in Chinese and Japanesecultures (Tso, 1928; Guy & Yeh, 1938; Takeuchi, 1992; Ping-Chen, 1995).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 584.47 The daily intake of isoflavones in the Japanese population has been estimated to be in the range 150-200 mg (Cassidy et al , 1994) although other estimates of 25-100 mg/ day have been suggested to represent a more likely intake for this population (Coward et al , 1993). Nagata et al (2000) studied the dietary intake of isoflavones in 69 Japanese men residing in Japan. Semi-quantitative food frequencyquestionnaires (FFQ) indicated an intake of 22 mg isoflavones/ day following consumption of 51 g of soyproducts per day in this population. 4.48 This is in agreement with studies by Kimira et al (1998), Wakai et al (1999), and Arai et al (2000) where Japanese adults residing in Japan were reported to consume isoflavones in the range of 30-50 mg/ day. 4.49 Kikuchi et al (2001) reported a daily intake of 35 mg isoflavones from consumption of soy products (8-40 g soybean products/ day) for Japanese adults. Data collated from the Japanese National NutritionalSurvey was also used to calculate isoflavone intake from the general diet. Daily intake of isoflavones forJapanese school children, adults and the elderly was reported to be 18, 38 and 43 mg isoflavones,respectively. 4.50 Chinese populations are reported to have isoflavone intakes similar to the Japanese. Intake of isoflavones for healthy Chinese women in Shanghai was calculated to be 39 mg/ day from consumption of soy(approximately 100 g soy/ day). This calculation was based on data from 60 Shanghai women (aged 37-61years) asked to complete a 24-hour food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and report on the frequency ofsoy consumption over the previous five years (Chen et al, 1999). 4.51 In a survey of Hong Kong Chinese women (n= 650), total intake of phytoestrogens was reported to be 60.5 mg/ day based on consumption data. Subjects (aged /H1102140 years) were asked to complete 24 hour, weekly and monthly FFQs of soy-based foods. The phytoestrogen content of each food was estimatedusing published values. Mean daily intakes for isoflavones and lignans were reported to be 25 /H1100635 and 2 /H110061 mg/ day, respectively (Mei et al , 2001). 4.52 In a Singapore study on diet and cancer, the dietary habits of Chinese men (n= 76) and Chinese women (n= 71) aged 45-74 years were assessed using FFQ's. Mean isoflavone intake from the total diet wascalculated at 61 mg/ day (Seow et al , 1998). 4.53 Dietary isoflavone intake of a Korean population was estimated to be 15 mg/ day. This was based on data collated from the Korean National Nutritional Survey and published literature values on the isoflavonecontent of soy-based foods. Soybeans and soy foods, tofu, soybean paste and soybean sproutscontributed to more than 94% of the total isoflavone intake of the Korean population (Kim & Kwon,2001). 4.54 The mean dietary soy isoflavone intake of elderly Japanese-American women (aged over 65 years) was estimated to be 10 mg/ day (Rice et al , 2001).594.55 In contrast, the estimated dietary isoflavone intake reported for the UK and other Western populations is significantly lower than that reported for Eastern populations (see Table 4.13). The mean daily dietaryintake of isoflavones in postmenopausal Caucasian women in the United States (n= 964) was calculatedto be 0.8 mg/ day (mainly from beans and peas). Fruit derived lignans and coumestans from vegetableswere calculated to contribute 0.6 and approximately 0.3 mg/ day, respectively to the diet (De Kleijn et al, 2001). 4.56 In a study investigating phytoestrogen intake and cancer, 190 Caucasian American men were asked to complete questionnaires on their lifestyle and diet for the previous year. The mean isoflavone intake wasestimated at 1.2 mg/ day (Strom et al , 1999). This is in contrast to findings by Kirk et al (1999) where a smaller sample of staff (n= 29 omnivores and n= 22 vegetarians) from an American university were askedto report on frequency of consumption of soy foods. Mean soy-derived isoflavone intakes werereported to be 10 and 15 mg/ day for omnivores and vegetarians, respectively. 4.57 In Australian-born women aged 51-62 years, the mean intake was estimated to be 17 mg isoflavones/ day. This was calculated from a cohort of Australian women (n= 354) of which 62% reported consumingisoflavone rich foods such as soy breads, soymilk and linseed bread. Although reported isoflavoneconsumption ranged from 0-340 mg isoflavones/ day, only 14% of the women surveyed consumed morethan 40 mg isoflavones/ day (Gutherie et al , 2002). 4.58 Average consumption of isoflavones in New Zealand is estimated at 0.8 mg isoflavones/ day for individuals following an omnivorous diet and 140 mg isoflavones/ day for those following a vegan diet.These estimates were based on calculations from two sample, three-day diets for the omnivorous dietsand the same diets with soy substitutions for the vegan diet (Taylor & Burlingame, 1998).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 60Table 4.13 Comparison of estimated dietary isoflavone intakes for Western and Eastern populations.

The study group consisted of women of Asian ancestry (aged 36-80 years) who hadmaintained some of their traditional dietary habits. Self-administered food questionnaires indicateddietary isoflavone intake differed significantly among ethnic groups, with Japanese women consuminghighest levels of dietary isoflavones 18.9mg isoflavones/ day following consumption of 6.1g soy proteinper day (see Table 4.14). Table 4.14 Mean soy protein and isoflavone intake among Hawaiian women by ethnicity. Estimated intakes based on the usual eating habits during both the previous 24 hrs and the previous12 months. Modified after Maskarinec et al (1998) Key points Phytoestrogens are natural constituents of many plants, seeds and grains. There is considerable variation of phytoestrogen concentrations in different plants. A number of factors can influence thephytoestrogen content including, species and strain differences and environmental conditions.Processing can also alter the phytoestrogen content of foodstuffs. Studies indicate that the most prevalent isoflavones in the UK diet are genistein and daidzein. Formononetin, biochanin A and glycitein are also present but to a lesser extent and often atundetectable levels. In general, commercial processing of soy into food products reduces phytoestrogen concentrations and can alter the chemical form of isoflavones present. Hence, isoflavone concentrations in fermentedand soy-based food products are usually lower. Soy is recognised as a major dietary source of isoflavones. There is a paucity of data on the forms and concentrations of lignans in plants and foods. Vegan or vegetarian diets may have higher intakes ofphytoestrogens compared with the general population, due to the consumption of soy-based meatand dairy replacement foods.Soy intake/ (n=11) (n=25) (n=42) Soy protein intake during previous 24 h (g/ day) 13 2 8 9 3 Soy protein intake during previous year (g/ day) 5 2 5 6 9 Dietary isoflavone intake during previous 24 h (mg/ day) 38 5 22 31 7 Dietary isoflavone intake during previous year (mg/ day) 12 5 12 19 5Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 62 Estimated exposure of infants to phytoestrogens is dependent on whether the infant is fed breast or formula milk. Soy-based infant formulae have been shown to contain significantly higherconcentrations of isoflavones than human breast milk. Cows' milk-based formula contains nodetectable isoflavones. Concentrations of isoflavones have been shown to be generally higher inthe breast milk of mothers following a vegetarian or vegan diet, (corresponding to approximately 2-32 /H9262g isoflavones/L). However, these concentrations were substantially lower than those present in soy-based infant formulae (18-41 mg isoflavones/L made up foods (18-78 mgisoflavone/kg). Mean intakes of estimated at 4.5-5 mg/kg bw/ day,although other studies have indicated that consumption may be higher. A range of phytoestrogen food supplements is now widely available in the UK. Analysis has shown that the actual phytoestrogen content varied between products and was often less than the contentdeclared on the label. Soybeans have, for many centuries, played an integral part in some Eastern cultures (e.g. Japanese and Chinese) as a foodstuff, although soy is not generally fed to infants in the first 4-6 months of life.Comparison of estimated dietary isoflavone intakes in Western and Eastern populations illustrate thatEastern populations have a significantly higher intake of phytoestrogens. These differences aregenerally attributed to the usage and higher consumption of soy and soy-based foods. Due to the large variability in isoflavone concentrations in plants and foods it is difficult to provide direct comparisons between different exposure groups. Broadly speaking however, a rank order maybe determined of daily isoflavone intake: soy formula fed infant (approximately 40 mg/ day) /H11022average Japanese consumer (approximately 25-100 mg/ day) /H11022vegetarian consumer (approximately 3 mg/ day) /H11022average UK consumer (approximately 1 mg/ day). There are few data on the intake of consumers of dietary supplements and 'functional foods'. It is possible that exposures from thesesources may equate to those of infants fed soy-based formula for products that are particularly richin isoflavones.

Most of the information concerns the isoflavones daidzein andgenistein and to a lesser extent, the lignans enterodiol and enterolactone. This chapter reviews theADME studies carried out in humans and, where indicated, provides relevant additional informationgained from animal studies. There are no data available on the ADME of prenylated flavonoids orcoumestans. Other gaps in the knowledge in this area are highlighted in this chapter. Absorption Uptake 5.2 Isoflavones are present in food mainly as glucosides. Although there is evidence to suggest that particular members of a related class of flavonoids are absorbed in their naturally occurring glucosidicforms (Hollman & Katan, 1997), this does not appear to be the case for the isoflavones. It is thought thatisoflavones are absorbed as aglucones, which are more readily absorbed than the parent glucosides dueto their higher hydrophobicity and lower molecular weight. Glucosides of isoflavones have not beenidentified in plasma. This is supported by recent evidence from Setchell et al (2002), which indicates that isoflavone glucosides are not absorbed intact across the enterocyte of healthy adults and shows thatuptake requires hydrolysis of the isoflavone glucosides to their aglucone form. Absorption of agluconestakes place mainly in the small and large intestine (see Figure 5.1). Transfer 5.3 It has been suggested that acid hydrolysis of glucosides occurs in the stomach (Kelly et al, 1993) although there is some disagreement about this (Piskula et al , 1999). There is evidence that the liver and enterocytes of the human small intestine contain \u00df-glucosidase enzymes capable of efficientlyhydrolysing some, but not all, naturally occurring flavone and isoflavone glucosides (Day et al , 1998). microflora (including Lactobacilli , Bifidobacteria Bacteroides ) also role in glucoside hydrolysis (Xu et al, 1995; Barnes et al, 1996). A study has also suggested that isoflavone glucosides can be converted to aglucones by enzymes in saliva (Allred et al, 2001). In humans, prior to absorption, the isoflavones may be further metabolised by the gut microflora, with genisteinbeing converted to the hormonally inert p-ethyl-phenol and daidzein reduced the O-demethylangolensin Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of phytoestrogensCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 70Figure 5.1 Schematic representation of absorption of daidzein from the gut. Prior to absorption from the gut, daidzin is converted to daidzein by gut microfloral enzymes. It ispartially converted to glucuronide and sulphate conjugates by enzymes in the liver before entering theperipheral circulation. These conjugates can be excreted back into the gut from the liver via the bile duct(enterohepatic circulation) where they can be deconjugated by gut microfloral enzymes. They may then bere-absorbed or further transformed in the gut and absorbed. O OOOH O OHOH OHOH OOHOOH Further transformations information on the processing of lignans and coumestans prior to absorption has been reported. However, ingested lignans have been shown to undergo bacterial hydrolysis and metabolism. Colonicfermentation results in the removal of glucose residues, demethylation and dehydroxylation to thediphenol compounds, enterolactone and enterodiol, which are absorbed. Enterodiol may be furthermetabolised enterolactone in the gut (Setchell & Adlercreutz, 1998; Kurzer & Xu, 1997) (see Figure 5.2). 5.5 Studies have suggested that isoflavones are more bioavailable in food if present as aglucones (as in fermented soy) than when present as glucosides (as in unprocessed soy). Hutchins et al (1995) reported that the recovery of urinary daidzein and genistein was higher when subjects consumed a diet consistingof tempeh (fermented soy) compared to a similar diet containing conjugated isoflavones in the form ofunfermented soy pieces. In addition, Slavin et al (1998) reported that while fermentation decreased the isoflavone content of soy, the increased recovery of urinary isoflavones observed suggestedfermentation (conversion to aglucones) increased the bioavailability of isoflavones. However, thebioavailability of isoflavones reported in these studies may be attributable to differences in the foodmatrix rather than the chemical form of the isoflavones. 5.6 More recent studies suggest that isoflavone bioavailability is independent of form (i.e. glucoside or aglucone). Richelle et al (2002) showed that plasma concentrations of isoflavones were similar in subjects (n= 6) after consumption of a soy drink which had been enzymatically treated to convert theisoflavone glucosides to their aglucone form, compared with subjects that had ingested the untreateddrink. In a study by Tsunoda et al (2002), similar concentrations of isoflavones were found in the urine of subjects (n= 14) consuming equal quantities of isoflavones either as glucosides or aglucones. 5.7 Data from animal studies indicates that, although the initial rates of absorption and excretion for the aglucone forms were greater than for the conjugated forms, the total percentage recoveries in urine andfaeces does not differ significantly. Thus, the extent of absorption and the bioavailability of aglucone andglucosidic forms are considered to be similar (King et al, 1996). An FSA project is currently examining what effect food matrix and isoflavone form has on the bioavailability of isoflavones in humans. Metabolism Bacterial activity in the human intestine8 5.8 Metabolism of isoflavones and lignans is mediated both by tissue enzymes and gut microflora, either prior to absorption or during enterohepatic circulation (see Figure 5.1). 8The reader is referred to the Institute of Environmental Health Report: Assessment of phytoestrogens in the diet (1997) for a d etailed treatise on gut floral composition, inter-individual variations and implications for health.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 725.9 The importance of the gut microflora in the metabolism of phytoestrogens has been clearly established. Setchell et al (1984) showed that incubation of textured vegetable protein with cultured human faecal bacteria resulted in the formation of equol, a metabolic reduction product of daidzein (see Figure 5.3).Chang & Nair (1995) demonstrated the metabolism of daidzein to benzopyran- withhuman faecal bacteria under anaerobic conditions. Antibiotic treatment in humans has been shown toinhibit the formation and excretion of enterolactone and enterodiol, (Setchell et al , 1981). 5.10 Several groups of bacteria are known to possess \u00df-glucosidase activity, including Lactobacilli, Bacteroides andBifidiobacteria (Hawkesworth et al , 1971). However, little research has been carried out to identify the types of bacteria specifically involved in the metabolism of isoflavones or lignans. 5.11 In humans, the upper third of the small intestine contains very low levels of bacteria, but this changes to a colon-like flora in the lower third (Heneghen, 1988). The distal part of the small intestine and the largeintestine contain substantial numbers (10 4-107bacteria/g wet weight) of and Bifodiobacteria , 1967; Mitsuoka 1982) whereas the proximal end of the small intestine contains very few of these bacteria. 5.12 Some bacteria present in the large intestine also possess \u00df-glucuronidase and arylsulfatase activity, which can liberate aglucones from conjugates excreted in the bile and render them available forreabsorption (Heneghan, 1988). Incubation studies with human faeces suggest that human intestinalbacteria from some, but not all, individuals can further metabolise and degrade isoflavones (Xu et al , 1995), thus preventing their reabsorption from the lower bowel. Consequently, the composition ofintestinal microflora can have a profound effect both on the magnitude and pattern of isoflavonebioavailability. 5.13 Genistein and biochanin A, are much more susceptible to cleavage of the central ring system by rat intestinal bacteria than daidzein or formononetin (Griffiths & Smith, 1972). Whether the same is true withhuman faecal bacteria is unclear, although selective central ring cleavage of certain flavonoidcompounds by certain strains of Clostridium isolated from human faecal flora has been shown (Winter et al , 1989; Hur et al, 2002). Less faecal degradation should result in greater exposure to lignans and isoflavones in the circulation and increased urinary isoflavone excretion, althoughspecific data are lacking. 5.14 Lignans have also been shown to produce enterodiol and enterolactone in humans via microfloral metabolism (Setchell & Adlercreutz, 1998) (see Figure 5.2).73Conjugation 5.15 Once absorbed, isoflavones and lignans are efficiently reconjugated, either with glucuronic acid or, to a lesser extent, sulfate. In addition, some sulfoglucuronides may be formed. Conjugation takes placeeither in the liver with hepatic UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (Knight & Eden,1996; Bingham al, 1998; Setchell, 1998), or within the intestinal epithelium, which has also been shown to possess glucuronosyl transferase and sulfotransferase activity (Sfakianos et al , 1997). As a consequence, isoflavones and lignans are present in the circulation in predominantly conjugated forms. 5.16 Zhang et al (1999) have shown that rat microsomal UDP-glucuronosyl transferase has a greater affinity for genistein than daidzein in vitro. However, it remains unclear as to the relevance of this finding to humans. Figure 5.2 Example conversion of lignans to enterolactone and enterodiol by human faecal flora.

Studies have revealed several diphenolic metabolites can be produced during the intermediary metabolism of daidzein and genistein.The intermediate metabolites can be produced either from & Ohsawa, 1998; Heinonen et al, 1999). It has been shown that some aglucones may undergo metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (Roberts-Kirchhoff et al , 1999). Incubations with genistein in the presence of human recombinant CYP1A1 9, 1A2, 1B12, or 2E1 isoforms resulted in the formation of one predominant and two minor unidentified metabolites. Incubation with CYP3A4 catalysed the formation of two uni dentified products. All metabolites were considered to be hydroxylation products. Similarly, tr ansformation of the flavonoid galangin to kaempferol then to quercetin in rat liver microsomes is thought to be CYP-mediated, with the latter step being attributed specifically to CYP1A1 (Silva et al , 1997). Additionally, metabolism studies with cultured (T47D breast cancer) cells have shown that biochanin A and genistein undergo methylation and hydroxylation reactions as well as sulfate esterformation (Peterson et al , 1998) . 5.18 Following incubation of multiply labelled 3H-genistein with rat faecal detection-HPLC. Further hydrolysis by the gut microflora of human and rat, resulted in theformation of 4-hydroxyphenol-2-propionic acid (Coldham et al, 2002). Previous work has suggested that 4-p-ethylphenol was the final metabolite in the plasma and urine of rats and humans after administration of unlabelled genistein (Barnes et al , 1998; King, 1998; Setchell, 1998). 5.19 Five metabolites of genistein were identified in rats following an oral dose of 4 mg genistein/kg bw. The , 1999). The last of these metabolites is thought to be a microfloral product of dihydrogenistein. The major metabolites ofgenistein identified in the rat are therefore the same as those identified in man. 9CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 activities are low or absent in human liver.75Figure 5.3 Proposed phase I metabolism of daidzein and genistein based on human urinary metabolites.Adapted from Joannou et al , 1995. Lignans 5.20 A range of lignan metabolites of enterodiol and enterolactone have been identified in the urine and bile of female rats (Niemeyer et al , 2000). Following intraduodenal administration of enterodiol producedfrom enterodiol and 11 were produced from enterolactone. The precise identity of these compounds wasnot Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 76Distribution 5.22 Isoflavone and lignan phytoestrogens have been detected in a number of body fluids such as urine, plasma, faeces, prostatic fluid, semen, bile, saliva, breast milk, breast aspirate and cyst fluid. The majorisoflavones and their metabolites detected in the blood and urine of humans and animals are daidzein,genistein, equol and O-DMA (Adlercreutz et al , 1995; Knight & Eden, 1996). Lignans identified in human plasma and urine include enterolactone, enterodiol, lariciresinol and isolariciresinol (Adlercreutz et al , 1987; Jacob et al, 2002). 5.23 In rats, relatively high levels of daidzein in the plasma, liver, lung and kidney were observed 15 min after intravenous injection. Lower levels were found in skeletal muscle, spleen, heart, testis and brain (Yueh &Chu, 1997). 5.24 Following intraperitoneal administration to rats, genistein rapidly appears in brain and then in microdialysate fluid from the corpus striata together with its metabolite p-ethyl-phenol (Setchell, 1998). Following oral administration of 14C-genistein to rats, the levels in reproductive organs (vagina, uterus, ovary and prostate) were higher than in other peripheral organs. The major plasma-derived compoundswere genistein glucuronides and 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-propionic acid with only trace amounts of parentcompound (Coldham & Sauer, 2000). 5.25 The concentrations of genistein in plasma and selected tissues in weaning (plasma only) and adult rats exposed to genistein in utero , through maternal milk from dietary administration to the mothers and to the offspring after weaning (5, 100 or 500 mg genistein/kg diet) were measured (Chang et al , 2000). Plasma and tissue concentrations of genistein increased dose dependently. Genistein was predominantly(95-99%) present in conjugated form in plasma but to a much lesser extent in tissues, unconjugatedgenistein ranged from 18-100% (see Table 5.1). Gender differences in the tissue concentrations of genisteinand the proportion of genistein in conjugated form were evident particularly in the liver, thyroid andmammary glands. Little genistein was detected in the brain. 5.26 Holder et al (1999) demonstrated that genistein was predominantly conjugated (90%) to glucuronic acid with minor quantities of sulfate conjugates in the plasma of rats. Janning et al (2000) also demonstrated that following a single dose of daidzein (100 mg/kg bw) administered to adult female rats, daidzein wasdetected in plasma almost exclusively in its conjugated form.77Table 5.1 Plasma and tissue concentrations of genistein in male and female rats. Concentrations and percentage unconjugated genistein shown are from animals (n= 6) exposed to 500mggenistein/kg diet. Adapted from Chang et al (2000). aConcentrations in plasma are given in /H9262mol/L. bConcentrations in brain were at or below the limit of detection (0.5 pmol/mg). Pharmacokinetics 5.27 Many studies have examined the excretion profiles of phytoestrogens. However, few have examined the pharmacokinetics of these compounds in plasma. Isoflavones 5.28 In a study, by Watanabe et al (1998), seven adult males (previously receiving an otherwise low isoflavone diets for 6 days) received a single dose of baked soybean powder (26 mg daidzein [103 /H9262mol] and 30 mg genistein [112 /H9262mol]). The isoflavone concentrations in plasma, urine and faeces are shown in Table 5.2. Plasma genistein concentrations had significantly increased 2 hours after ingestion and reachedmaximum concentrations by 8 hours. The plasma concentration of daidzein peaked at approximately thesame time but was lower than genistein. Plasma levels of O-DMA and equol peaked later than genistein and daidzein in 2/7 and 4/7 subjects, respectively. 5.29 In contrast to plasma, daidzein was the major compound present in urine. Recoveries of ingested daidzein and genistein in urine were 36% and 18%, respectively. Equol was detectable in the urine of 2/7subjects and was observed after the peak of daidzein excretion.Tissue Genistein Concentration (80%) Uterus 1.4 (100%)Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 78Table 5.2 Total recovery of isoflavones, O-DMA and equol in urine and faeces of men after ingestion of 60g kinako (baked soybean powder).Data adapted from Watanabe et al , 1998. aThese values are the percentage of recovery of daidzein ingested. O-DMA = O-desmethylangolensin. 5.30 Most of the isoflavones recovered in the faeces 2-3 days after ingestion. Excretion of total diphenolics, including equol, was often higher in the second and third days than in the 24 hours afteringestion. This suggests that faecal isoflavones and equol were and faeces was /H1101155% whereas /H1101120% of administered genistein was recovered unchanged. Plasma half-lives for genistein and daidzein were 8.4 and 5.8 hours, respectively. 5.31 Significant inter-individual variation was observed in the plasma and urinary levels of equol and O-DMA. In addition, a biphasic peak in plasma and urine genistein and daidzein concentrations was observed in a number of subjects, suggesting enterohepatic circulation. 5.32 A recently completed study investigated the pharmacokinetic profile of 13C-labelled daidzein and genistein administered to pre-menopausal women (n=20). Four separate experiments were conducted. Inthe first, subjects received a single oral dose of 0.4 mg/kg bw of each compound. This was repeated inthe second experiment to assess intra-individual variability in metabolism. To assess the effects of doseon pharmacokinetics 0.8 mg/kg bw doses were administered in the third experiment and in the fourth0.4 mg/kg bw doses were administered following ingestion of 50 mg/kg bw isoflavones in 7 1 1 2 1 /H110211 /H1102111 0 /H110211 24 7 5 1 2 /H110211 /H1102112 7 6 32 8 5 4 2 /H110211 /H1102111 1 3 43 0 5 6 6 /H110211 /H1102111 2 3 56 5 1 3 2 2 /H110211 /H1102114 8 7 63 2 1 1 /H1102113 4 8 2 0 /H110211 73 0 2 8 1 1 9 3 1 0 /H110211 Mean 37 4.5 4.9 2.1 8.3 2.3 19.7 3.1 SD 14.1 4.2 4.1 1.8 13.2 2.6 14.0 2.5 Recovery (%) 36 4 4a2a7a2a18 2795.33 No significant differences in serum and urinary profiles were observed between repeat doses demonstrating little intra-individual variability in metabolism of daidzein and genistein. Mean plasmahalf-lives for both compounds were 7.7 hours. Peak plasma concentrations were greater for genistein thandaidzein at the doses used, suggesting genistein is the more bioavailable isoflavone. The bioavailability ofboth compounds, as assessed by AUC (area under the curve) increased with dose. Both compounds hada large volume of distribution. The mean recoveries of daidzein and genistein were 30% and 9%,respectively, suggesting significant metabolism to other compounds (Setchell et al , 2003). 5.34 A mean half-life of 9.2 hours was reported for total genistein in a study of men (n= 30) ingesting a bw, /H1102290% genistein) (Busby et al, 2002). At the highest dose the plasma C maxfor total and free genistein was 7.7 and 0.07 /H9262M, respectively, indicating extensive conjugation by the liver. 5.35 Howes et al (2002) reported half-lives for the isoflavones genistein, daidzein, formononetin and biochanin A of 13, 16, 23 and 18 hours, respectively, after chronic ingestion of a red clover supplement (1.5, 1.5, 16 and 24.5 mg genistein, daidzein, formononetin and biochanin A, respectively) in 14 subjects.Mean C maxranged from 0.04 (formononetin) to 0.5 /H9262M (genistein). 5.36 In a study by King & Bursill (1998) the plasma and urine concentrations of daidzein and genistein peaked 7 to 8 hours after ingestion of a single soybean based meal by adult men (n= 6). Elimination half-liveswere approximately 5 and 6 hours for daidzein and genistein, respectively. Although the urinary excretionof daidzein was greater than that for genistein, the ratios of the plasma AUCs for the respectiveisoflavones were similar to the ratio of concentrations present in the soybean meal, indicating similarbioavailabilities for the two isoflavones (King & Bursill, 1998). Similar findings were reported by Xu et al (2000). These studies apparently conflict with those of Watanabe et al (1998) and Setchell et al (2003). However, a study by Setchell et al (1998) employing pure isoflavones administered as a single bolus dose, has also demonstrated that the bioavailability of daidzein and genistein (determined from plasmaappearance and disappearance curves) are similar. Peak plasma concentrations were usually attainedbetween 6-8 hours after ingestion and plasma half-lives were approximately 8 hours. 5.37 In a study reported by Xu et al (1994), the plasma concentrations of daidzein and genistein in women (n= 12) were both significantly increased 6.5 hours after the consumption of a soy milk powder drink(containing a daidzein:genistein ratio of 44:56). Faecal excretion urinary excretion of much higher than that of genistein (9%), theauthors concluded that daidzein had a greater bioavailability. 5.38 Coward et al (1996) reported that the ratios of genistein to daidzein concentrations in plasma did not vary significantly from that present in a soy beverage, thus suggesting bioavailability of the twoisoflavones in humans was similar. However, daidzein conjugates were reported to be more bioavailablethan genistein conjugates, when administered to rats as a soy extract (King, 1998).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 805.39 The pharmacokinetics of genistein and daidzein was compared with that of their glucosides in premenopausal women (n= 19) fed a 50 mg single bolus dose of each compound (Setchell et al , 2001). All compounds were efficiently absorbed from the intestinal tract however, the glucosides took longerto achieve maximum plasma concentrations (9.3 and 9.0 hours compared with 5.2 and 6.6 hours forgenistein and daidzein, respectively). The bioavailability of the isoflavones was greater when ingested inthe glucoside form. 5.40 Gender differences in bioavailability were reported in rats (Coldham & Sauer, 2000). The mean total excretion of 14C-genistein, after an oral dose of 4 mg/kg bw for male and female rats, was approximately 67% and 33% in faeces and urine, respectively, within 168 hours of dosing. Mean and maximalconcentrations in the plasma were higher in male than in female with half-lives of 12.4 hours and 8.5hours, respectively. 5.41 In a study by Janning et al (2000), the plasma concentration-time curve following intravenous administration of daidzein to female rats could be fitted to a triexponential model with a final half-lifeof 4 hours. The oral bioavailability was 9.7% and 2.2% when 10 and 100 mg daidzein/kg bw, respectively,were administered, which suggests that absorption is saturable. Multiple peaks in the plasmaconcentration-time profile, which is suggestive of enterohepatic circulation. 5.42 Supko & Malspeis (1995) reported a pharmacokinetic profile for genistein in the male mouse. Plasma profiles of genistein after intravenous injection showed a prominent secondary peak 1-hour afteradministration followed by decay phase with a mean half-life of 40 minutes. The bioavailability ofgenistein (180 mg/kg bw) after oral gavage was 12% producing a peak plasma concentration of 3.7 /H9262M. Plasma levels after intraperitoneal injection of genistein (185 mg/kg bw) were approximately 5- foldhigher than achieved by the oral route. Lignans 5.43 Nesbitt et al (1999) examined the urinary and plasma profiles of the lignans, enterolactone and enterodiol following single (day 1) and repeated (days 1-7 or 8) administration of flaxseed. Dosages of 5,15 or 25 mg of raw or processed flaxseed (in the form of bread or a muffin) were given to nine women.The subjects were dosed during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle and otherwise maintainedon a low-lignan, low-fibre diet. The urinary excretion of lignans dose-dependent bythe form in which the flaxseed was ingested. Enterodiol was the predominant lignan in urine and plasma,although considerable variation in the ratio of enterolactone:enterodiol was evident among individuals.Significant increases in plasma concentrations of lignans were observed within 9 hours of the first dose.These plasma levels were maintained at 12 and 24 hours 10post administration. Significantly higher concentrations of lignans were excreted within 12-24 hours after dosing when compared to the first 12hours. The plasma AUC after repeated administration was higher than after single dose administrationindicating bioaccumulation. 10Plasma half-lives for the lignans could not be determined from the data. However, the data did indicate a slow absorption and/ o r excretion of these compounds.815.44 Morton et al (1997) also reported comparatively slower plasma accumulation of lignans compared to isoflavones. An increase in serum concentrations of daidzein and genistein were observed within30 minutes following consumption of a cake containing soybean flour and cracked linseed, in malesubjects reaching a maximum within 5.5-8.5 hours after ingestion. In contrast, increases in the plasmalevels of enterolactone and enterodiol were not observed until 8.5 hours after ingestion. 5.45 Jacobs et al (2002) examined the plasma profile of enterolactone following consumption of wholegrain foods or refined-grain foods in adults aged between 26-54 years. In this crossover feeding study men (n= 5) and women (n= 6) were assigned to a 6 week diet, with an intervening washout period of 6-9 weeks.Despite considerable variation in baseline serum enterolactone between and within subjects, differencesin serum enterolactone concentrations in subjects on the two diets was evident after 2 weeks andcontinued to increase over the 6-week period. Concurrent antibiotic treatment, administered in twosubjects only, was found to reduce serum enterolactone concentrations. However, concentrationsrecovered after 2 weeks in the subject on whole grain diet whereas, concentrations remained lowered inthe subject on the refined-grain diet. 5.46 A crossover intervention trial by Juntunen et al (2000), studied the effect of rye bread on serum and urine enterolactone in healthy men (n= 18) and women (n= 21) all aged 43 years. Groups consumed wholemealrye bread for 4 weeks followed by washout period. The mean concentration of serum enterolactone wassignificantly lower in men following consumption of rye bread compared with women (26 versus 40 nM)suggesting pharmacokinetic differences in lignan metabolism. However, mean concentrations of urinaryenterolactone were similar between men and women (5.1 versus 4.9 /H9262M). 5.47 A single meal of lignan-rich berries resulted in elevated plasma levels (p /H110210.05) and increased urinary excretion of the mammalian lignan enterolactone 24 hours post challenge (Mazur et al , 2000). Adults aged 23-55 (n= 5) were maintained on a phytoestrogen free regime for 72 hours before consuming a singlemeal of strawberries (500 g). The strawberries contained secoisolariciresinol (12 mg) and matairesinol(1 mg). In subjects, 24 hour urinary enterolactone concentrations ranged from 0.9-6.6 /H9262mol enterolactone suggestive of variations in metabolism and gut microflora. Summary of pharmacokinetic findings 5.48 There is a paucity of data regarding the pharmacokinetics of phytoestrogens, particularly with respect to the lignans. To date, only one published study has concurrently determined the appearance andelimination of soy-derived isoflavones and their major metabolites in plasma, urine and faeces. In mostof the studies reported to date, the total recovery of dose is not stated and unlikely to be 100% sincethe complete metabolic fate of the dose is never established.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 825.49 In general, peak concentrations of daidzein and genistein are achieved within 5-8 hours after ingestion. Plasma concentrations of genistein and daidzein begin to rise within 2 hours of an ingested dose and canoccur as early as 15 minutes after ingestion. It has been observed that a number of individuals exhibitmore than one plasma peak, which probably reflects enterohepatic circulation of the isoflavones. Theplasma half-lives for genistein and daidzein have been estimated at 5-8 hours. 5.50 There is debate as to whether aglucones are more bioavailable than the glucosides. This may ultimately be attributed to inter-individual variation and the gut microflora population (see paragraphs 5.76-5.78).Studies in rats have shown the bioavailability of aglucones and glucosides to be similar. The majority ofisoflavones are excreted in urine, either as parent compound or metabolites with only a smallpercentage of absorbed isoflavones appearing in the faeces either as parent compounds or metabolites.The data indicate considerable inter-individual variation in plasma and excretion profiles for daidzein andgenistein and their metabolites. Some individuals produced little or no O-DMA and equol (Kelly et al , 1995; , Morton 1994; Slavin et al, 1998; Lampe, 1998; Rowland et al , 1999). Repeat dosing of isoflavones may lead to accumulation. 5.51 Similarly, there is conjecture over the comparative bioavailability of genistein and daidzein. The bioavailability of these isoflavones appears to be similar when administered in a pure form. However, itdiffers when administered as part of foodstuffs, suggesting the bioavailability may be dependent uponthe form in which they are ingested. 5.52 Inter-study differences in the various pharmacokinetic parameters for genistein and daidzein probably reflect the differing matrices in which the isoflavones were administered (e.g. soyflour-based meal versuspowder drink or fermented soy versus purified isoflavones). Inter-individual differences such as gender,age and dietary habits may have also contributed to the differences observed between studies ofisoflavones and lignans. Excretion 5.53 Urine and bile are both important excretory routes for phytoestrogens. Several bacterial metabolites of isoflavones and lignans have been detected in faeces. Conjugates excreted in the bile canundergo deconjugation by gut bacteria and undergo enterohepatic circulation (see Figure 1). Eliminationvia the faeces is thus largely determined by the degree of enterohepatic circulation, which may result inprolonged exposure to these compounds. 5.54 Short-term studies have shown that no more than 30% of an ingested dose of isoflavone is recovered from the urine and faeces in a diphenolic form. It has been suggested that this low recovery is the resultof extensive microbial degradation of isoflavones, producing simpler The pattern of phytoestrogen excretion reflects that of food intake. Thus, in Western populations, where the typical diet is relatively low in isoflavones, urinary levels of isoflavones tend to be lower than lignanlevels. Concentrations of total phytoestrogens are relatively low in most subjects consuming omnivorousdiets not containing soy-based foods. In contrast, vegetarians and individuals consuming macrobioticdiets tend to have higher urinary excretion of phytoestrogens, particularly lignans (Adlercreutz et al Intervention studies suggest that urinary excretion of isoflavones increases with increased soyintake, but absorption, as reflected by urinary excretion, may be saturable at high doses 1997; al , concentration of total lignans and isoflavones and their metabolites in a group of Japanese women (age= 47 /H1100612 years) consuming a traditional diet was compared to different ethnic populations. These included macrobiotic lactovegetarian (n= 11) and omnivorous (n= 10) women (age= 56 /H11006 3 years), and lactovegetarian (n= 11) and omnivorous (n= 12) women from 33 /H110066 years) (Adlercreutz et al , 1989; 1991). comparison to the Japanese, lignan (enterolactone and enterodiol) excretion was greater in Finnish and American women. Omnivorous women had a relatively lowexcretion of daidzein, O-DMA and equol. However, the excretion of these compounds by vegetarian and macrobiotic women was comparable to that of the Japanese (see Table 5.3). Table 5.3 Excretion of lignans and isoflavones and their metabolites in different populations. Adapted (Adlercreutz et al , 1986; 1989; 1991). metabolites is the sum of daidzein, O-DMA and equol. 5.57 Roach et al (1998) reported the mean urinary excretion of total isoflavones was 5.4 /H9262mol/ day in a study of postmenopausal Chinese women (n= women Omnivores (n= 12) 2.4 0.2 Lactovegetarians (n= 11) 6.1 0.5 American women Omnivores (n= 10) 0.3Lactovegetarians (n= 11) 4.3 1.6Macrobiotics (n= 13) 26.6 6.2Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 845.58 Maskarenic et al (1998) investigated the association between dietary isoflavone intake and urinary excretion of isoflavones and metabolites among women of different ethnicity residing in Hawaii. Thestudy group consisted of women of Asian ancestry (aged 36-80 years) who had maintained some of theirtraditional dietary habits. Self-administered food questionnaires indicated dietary isoflavone intakediffered significantly among ethnic groups, with Japanese and Chinese women consuming highest levelsof isoflavones (see Table 5.4). The data illustrate possible ethnic differences in excretion of isoflavones.For example, although the dietary intake of isoflavones for Chinese and Japanese was similar, Japanesewomen had greater isoflavone excretion rates. However, this could also be due to a number of otherfactors such as overall diet, food matrix and transit time, which are discussed later in this chapter.Nevertheless, there was good correlation between urinary isoflavone excretion rates and dietary intakeover 24 hours between the respective ethnic groups. 5.59 Lampe et al (1999) found that the urinary isoflavones and their metabolites as well as lignans in an USA population were significantly higher in \"high\" compared to \"low\" fruit and vegetable consumers. However,there was also a positive correlation between high fat and processed meat intake and isoflavone andmetabolite excretion that could not be explained.

Modified after Maskarinec et al (1998). 5.60 Atkinson et al (2002) found that urinary isoflavones were higher in soy consumers than non-consumers (p/H110210.001). In this study, 312 American women, aged 25-59 years, completed food frequency questionnaires on their dietary habits of the previous 3.5 years. Women from Asian backgroundsreported greater frequency of soy consumption (75% of Asian women) compared with non-Asian women(28% of non-Asian women). Excretion rates also correlated with dietary intakes as determined by 1- dayfood frequency questionnaires completed 24 hours prior to urine collection (p /H110210.01).Phytoestrogen intake/ Chinese Filipino Hawaiian (n=42) Dietary isoflavone intake during previous 24 h (mg/ day) 38.2 5.0 22.2 31.3 6.9 65 12 72 134 28 Glycitein (nmol/h) 24 4 20 88 14 Coumestrol (nmol/h) 0 3 0 0.1 13855.61 The excretion of daidzein in the rat was investigated after a single oral dose of 100 mg daidzein/kg bw (Bayer et al , 2001). Total urinary excretion accounted for /H1102110% of the dose. In males, the urinary metabolites were identified as daidzein, daidzein-sulfate and daidzein-glucuronide. Only daidzein anddaidzein-glucuronide were identified in the females. The major pathway of excretion of daidzein in malesand females was as unchanged compound in the faeces. Other faecal metabolites such as equol and O-DMA accounted for /H110215% of the dose. Elimination half-lives for daidzein and its metabolites was /H1102112 hours. Gender differences in daidzein metabolism in rats may be attributed to the differential expression of hepatic phenolsulfotransferases (Dunn & Klaassen, 1998). 5.62 Coldham & Sauer (2000) found, following an oral dose of 14C-labelled genistein (4 mg/kg bw) to male and female rats, that 66% and 33% of the dose was excreted in urine and faeces, respectively. In addition,4-hydroxyphenyl-2-propionic acid was the exclusive urinary and metabolite et al, 1999; Coldham & Sauer, 2000). 5.63 Barnes et al (1996) examined the enterohepatic recirculation of 14C-labelled genistein female rats. Genistein (70-80% of the appeared in the bile as theglucuronide metabolite. Re-administration of this metabolite into intestine indelayed recovery in the Urinary and 7.4%, respectively. Inter-individual variation in ADME 5.64 Human metabolism and excretion of isoflavones and lignans are subject to considerable inter-individual variation (Setchell, 1998). Variation in the urinary excretion of genistein excretion of O-DMA, 6'OH-DMA, and in particular equol, has been shown following an oral soy challenge (Kelly et al, 1993). Several studies have suggested that approximately one third of the population are capable of equol production (Kelly et al, 1995; Setchell et al, 1984; Morton et al, 1994; Slavin et al , 1998; Lampe, 1998). An example is illustrated in Figure 5.4 (Rowland et al , 1999). As a consequence, higher concentrations of precursor compounds appear in the urine of low equol excretorsand inverse relationships have been established between equol 1998) and equoland O-DMA and 6'OH- O-DMA excretion (Kelly et al, 1993). It has b een suggested that low equol excretors will also have increased plasma levels of precursor compounds. 5.65 A recently completed study has also shown inter-individual variation in the urinary excretion of isoflavones and their metabolites following soy challenge in adults (Wiseman et al , 2003). In this study, 76 volunteers were fed either a high (104 /H1100624 mg total isoflavones/ day) or low (0.5 /H110060.5 mg total isoflavones/ day) soya diet for 10 weeks. Volunteers on the \"high\" soya diet showed extensive urinaryexcretion of daidzein, genistein and their metabolites. Of the volunteers on the as good equol of the faecal flora between equol and non-equol producers was investigated, however, the microflora (bacteria)responsible for equol production could not be isolated and therefore, were not be identified.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 865.66 Inter-individual variation in the ADME of lignans has also been reported. Nesbitt et al (1999) showed that 2/9 female subjects produced little or no enterolactone following ingestion of lignans fromflaxseed. Lampe et al (1994) also reported considerable differences in the ratios of urinary enterolactone and enterodiol in 30 women, following ingestion of flaxseed. These data suggest int er-individual varia tion in the ability to oxidise enterodiol to enterolactone. Diet 5.67 Studies in humans have shown that diet can influence metabolism of phytoestrogens mediated by the gut microflora. For example, consumption of less fat and more carbohydrate, as a proportion of totalenergy intake, has been correlated with greater equol production, particularly in women (Slavin et al , 1998; Lampe et al , 1998). The reason for this is unclear but it is possible that complex carbohydrates stimulate fermentation in the large bowel, resulting in an increased breakdown of daidzein to equol(Bingham et al , 1998; Rowland et al, 1999; 2000). of dietary fructo-oligosaccharides with intragastric administration of isoflavone glucones has been shown to modify the absorption andenterohepatic circulation in male rats (Uehara et al, 2001). Furthermore, low-fat diets are associated with decreased \u00df-glucuronidase activity in the intestinal contents, which may impede absorption of more fat-soluble deconjugated compounds (Adlercreutz et al , 1987). 5.68 Dietary fibre has been shown to affect the absorption, reabsorption and excretion of oestrogens and phytoestrogens by influencing the \u00df-glucosidase and \u00df-glucuronidase activities of the intestinalmicroflora. The bulking effect of dietary fibre, which results in the dilution of gut microflora activity, andthe hydrophobic bonding, particularly of non-conjugated compounds, are thought to contribute to areduction in absorption and reabsorption of isoflavones (Tew et al , 1996; Tham et al 1998). Vegetarians generally have higher faecal weights than omnivores, and a lower faecal bacterial \u00df-glucuronidaseactivity (Adlercreutz et al , 1987). The implication is that high dietary fibre could result in the partial disruption of enterohepatic circulation of phytoestrogens and endogenous oestrogens. Increased dietaryfibre intakes have also been associated with equol excretion, in females (Lampe et al , 1998). 5.69 The effect of diet on the metabolism of phytoestrogens, both from the influence on gut microflora and differences in hepatic enzyme activities, may in part explain, any ethnic differences in the metabolic, andperhaps biological, response to phytoestrogens.87Figure 5.4 Equol excretion in 23 subjects consuming soy isoflavones from extruded soy protein flour (56 mg isoflavones/day) for 17 days.(Adapted from Rowland et al , 1999) Gender 5.70 It has been claimed that there are gender differences in the metabolism and urinary excretion of isoflavones. Data reported by Lu & Anderson (1998) showed that during a one-month trial in whichsoymilk was ingested (80-210 mg and daidzein/ day) the excretion half-life progressivelyshortened in women but progressively lengthened in men throughout the trial. 5.71 Zhang et al (1999) reported gender differences in urinary glycitein, but not daidzein and genistein, following ingestion of soymilk. However, the sample size of these studies was small and these findingshave not been reported in other studies (Setchell, 1998). It has been reported that men excrete a higherratio of enterolactone:enterodiol than women, suggesting a gender difference in the colonic bacterialmetabolism of lignans (Kirkman et al, 1995). No difference in the urinary excretion of isoflavones was observed in this study, however the number of subjects in this study was small which limits the validityof this conclusion.100000 10000 1000 100 10Urinary equal (nmo l/d) Subject13579 1 1 1 5 1 7 1 9 2 1 2 3 13Good equol producers Poor equol producersCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 885.72 Gender differences have also been reported in humans for the serum concentrations of the lignan enterolactone. Jacobs et al (2002), reported higher serum enterolactone in women than in men (20 versus 6 nM) fed on wholegrain and refined grain diets. Although this was a small study (n= 11), thisgender-based difference remained apparent throughout a 6 week treatment period. 5.73 A smaller gender difference in the serum enterolactone concentrations was reported in a large study of Finnish adults (n= 2753) following normal consumption of lignan-containing foods (Kilkkinen et al, 2002). Men and women were reported to have baseline serum enterolactone concentrations of 17.7 and20.9 nM, respectively. 5.74 et al; 1999; and daidzein (Chang et al , 2000) have been reported in rats. Dihydrogenistein was identified as the major product in the faeces of female rats at 48 hours in contrast to the male where 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-propionic acidwas identified as the major metabolite. Furthermore, genistein appeared to be more extensively sulfatedin the liver of males compared to females (Coldham et al , 1999; Coldham & Sauer, 2000). Age 5.75 With the exception of the data from neonates and infants (see paragraphs 5.82-5.86), there have been no reports of age related differences in the metabolism of phytoestrogens (Adlercreutz et al , 1993). Inter-individual variability in gut mediated metabolism 5.76 The large inter-individual variation in phytoestrogen metabolism is likely to be largely a consequence of inter-individual differences in the gut microflora involved in metabolising these compounds. Variousphysiological, pathological and environmental factors are likely to influence gut bacterial profile,including hygiene, antibiotic use, bowel disease, stress, gut motility, gastric pH, mucin secretion, bilesecretion, diet and intestinal transit time. Gender, genetics and ethnicity may have a role in influencinggut bacterial profile although this remains to be clearly established (Kirijavainen & Gibson, 1999; Rowlandet al , 1999). 5.77 In a study by Kilkkinen et al (2002), the use of oral microbial medicines was found to decrease serum enterolactone concentrations in a study of Finnish adults (n= 2753). Serum enterolactone levels werefound to be lower in subjects that had used antimicrobials up to 12-16 months before sampling than innon-users (mean 16 versus 19 nmol/L). Enterolactone concentrations were also reduced with increasingnumber of antimicrobial treatments, although concentrations recovered with length of time from thelast administration. 5.78 The influence of gut microflora on inter-individual variability has been demonstrated in studies carried out in germ-free rats, which are devoid of gut microflora. The animals were fed soy protein and foundto excrete daidzein and genistein in metabolites, equol or O-DMA. Colonisation of the same rats with bacterial flora from a human subject capable of converting daidzein89to equol resulted in the substantial excretion of equol, but not O-DMA. Germ-free rats, colonised with flora from a non-equol-producing human, produced no detectable urinary equol and only trace amountsof O-DMA, when fed with soy protein (see Figure 5.5). Figure 5.5 Excretion of soy isoflavones by germ-free (GF) and human-flora-associated rats (HFA) rats. GF rats were associated with a faecal flora either from an equol-producing subject (HFA/equol) or a non-equol-producing subject (HFA/non-equol). The rats were then fed a diet containing soy protein. Germ-freerats fed soy excreted only daidzein and genistein and the bacterial and O-DMA were not detected. HFA/equol rats excreted substantial amounts of equol. In comparison, equol was not detected in HFA/non-equol producing animals although small amounts of O-DMA were formed (adapted from Rowland et al , 1999). Food matrix and transit time 5.79 The effects of the food matrix and intestinal transit time on phytoestrogen metabolism have yet to be investigated.Daidzein GF HFA/Equol Equol O-Dma Micro-floraCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 90Plasma protein binding 5.80 In the plasma, the extent of free phytoestrogen available for biological interaction (e.g. with oestrogen receptors) is determined by the extent to which they are bound to plasma proteins. Binding to plasmaproteins renders them unavailable to interact with other molecules (plasma protein binding is discussedfurther in Chapter 7). Hepatic metabolism 5.81 Biotransformation of phytoestrogens in the liver, involving phase I and II metabolism may be subject to the influence of genetic polymorphisms and influenced by environmental factors, including exposure todrugs and dietary components (for a review, see Pelkonen et al , 1998). These factors will all contribute to variability between individuals and the non-genetic factors will also contribute to variability within anindividual. It is also important to recognise that should phytoestrogens inhibit or induce xenobioticmetabolising systems then they have the potential to alter the metabolism of other compoundsincluding drugs. The implications of this are discussed by Evans (2000). Bioavailability and metabolism of phytoestrogens in the new-born and infants 5.82 On a body weight basis, some of the highest intakes of isoflavones can occur in very young babies (4 months old) fed soy-based infant formulae (see Chapter 4). It has been suggested that the plasmalevels achieved may be high enough to elicit biological effects (Setchell et al , 1997). However, several factors may influence age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics and metabolism ofphytoestrogens in adults and babies. These include the nature of the gut microflora, which can influencethe absorption, metabolism and reabsorption of isoflavones. Gut microflora can, to a limited extent, alsoinfluence body water content, which is higher in neonates and could result in an altered distribution ofhydrophilic compounds. However, clearance of foreign compounds in infants can be relatively high whencompared to adults for some foreign compounds on the basis of a relatively greater liver weight:bodyweight ratio (Renwick, 1998). Development of the gut microflora in the new-born and infant 5.83 It is unclear at what age an infant acquires the gut microflora necessary for the metabolism and absorption of isoflavones. Setchell et al (1997; 1998) reported that 4-month-old infants fed soy-based infant formula (approximately 28-47 mg isoflavones/ day) absorb isoflavones efficiently. Plasmaconcentrations of isoflavones in these infants were approximately 4 /H9262M and were judged to be 2-5 fold higher than peak plasma concentrations in adults consuming isoflavones (50 mg/ day). However,it appeared that the gut microflora in these infants were not fully developed beyond the initial hydrolysisof the glucosidic moiety since plasma levels of the isoflavone metabolite, equol, were found to be verylow. Cruz et al (1994) found low concentrations of equol in infants fed soy-based formulae. However, a study reported by Irvine (1998), suggested that infants can absorb and excrete daidzein and genisteinderived from soy- based infant formulae as efficiently as adults consuming soy products from the age of914 weeks did. However, there were only four infants in this study who received soy- based formula thus the small numbers make it difficult to generalise on these findings. 5.84 A recently completed study in human infants (4-6 months) and children ( /H110226 months) showed that infants fed soy-based infant formula excreted significant quantities of genistein, daidzein and glycitein intheir urine. O-DMA was detected in 3/6 infants and a small quantity of equol in one infant in the 4-6 month group (Rowland et al, 2003). However, in age groups /H110226 months, O-DMA and low levels of equol were found in urine from 12/16 and 3/16 subjects, respectively. This suggests that the ability to convertdaidzein to O-DMA develops early in infancy, while the ability to produce equol develops later. 5.85 The gut is sterile at birth, but within a week of birth a microflora begins to develop and the profile continues to change from infancy into adulthood (Klein, 1998). Factors such as the composition ofmaternal gut flora, the mode of delivery (conventional or caesarean birth), hygiene, environment andgenetics determine initial colonisation. The intestine of the new-born has a higher redox potentialcompared to adults, therefore the gut microflora which first colonises the gut must be capable ofoxidative metabolism and typically include Enterobacteria , Streptococci and Staphylococci . These facultative bacteria rapidly to provide a lower redox potential, thereafter allowingstrictly anaerobic bacteria, such as Bifidobacteria , Clostridia and Bacteroides, to flourish. 5.86 The type of feed the infant is given also influences the microflora. Faecal populations diversify more rapidly in formula-fed babies than in breast-fed babies (Kirjavainen and Gibson, 1999). Bacterial enzymeactivities increase with age and are greatly influenced by the adoption of an adult diet (Mykkanen et al , 1997). The influence of the diet is greater on the gut microflora of babies who were breast-fed than thosewho were fed infant formula. Isoflavones from soy-based formulae compared with human breast or cows milk 5.87 Soy-based formulae contain isoflavones largely in the form of glucosides and malonyl derivatives. In contrast, human breast milk and cows' milk contains much lower levels of total isoflavones. Theproportion of free to conjugated isoflavones in breast milk has not been reported. Human and cow's milkalso contains equol, and the levels present are determined by maternal diet (Setchell et al , 1997). Equol is not present in soy formula (see Chapter 4). Transfer of isoflavones to breast milk 5.88 A rapid and dose dependent increase in isoflavones was observed in breast milk following ingestion of 5, 10 or 20 g roasted soybeans (containing 0.08, 0.15 or 0.30 mg daidzein/kg and 0.08, 0.17 or 0.33 mggenistein/kg respectively). Isoflavones were detected in breast milk slightly later than they appeared inurine. The maximum concentrations in breast milk were attained 10-14 hours after ingestion and werefollowed by a smaller secondary peak. This biphasic pattern was also evident in both plasma and urineand is thought to be a reflection of enterohepatic circulation. A return to baseline levels was completewithin 2-4 days. The pattern of metabolites found in the breast milk reflected that observed in plasma(Franke & Custer, 1996; Franke et al , 1998).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 925.89 No studies have measured the transfer of lignans, prenylated isoflavonoids and coumestrol to breast milk. Placental 5.90 Genistein (20, 34 and 75 mg/kg bw) was administered by oral gavage to pregnant rats (n= 3) 20-21 days after confirmation of pregnancy (Doerge et al , 2001). Genistein concentrations were measured in maternal and fetal plasma and fetal brain 2 hours after administration. Genistein concentrations werelower in fetal plasma compared to maternal plasma and unlike maternal plasma, concentrations did notincrease dose dependently (see Table 5.4). However, a greater proportion of genistein was present in fetalplasma in unconjugated form. Concentrations of genistein in fetal brain were much lower than in fetalplasma but were predominantly in unconjugated form. Table 5.4 Concentrations of genistein in maternal plasma and fetal plasma and brain. Adapted from Doerge et al (2001). nd: Not determined. 5.91 In a study by Degen et al (2002), 10 mg daidzein/kg bw was administered intravenously to rats on day 18 of gestation. The fetal liver contained approximately 3% of the concentration found in maternal liver. 5.92 Little is known about trans-placental transfer of phytoestrogens in humans. To investigate this, Adlercreutz et al (1999) measured the level of isoflavones equol and O-DMA) and lignans (enterodiol and at delivery in the plasma of pregnant Japanese women(n=7) consuming soy-rich diets. Concentrations were also measured in 5.93 Daidzein, genistein, (enterolactone and enterodiol) were found in the amniotic fluid, maternal and cord plasma (Adlercreutzet al , 1999). Total concentrations of isoflavones and their ranged 19-744 nM (mean 223 nM) in maternal plasma, cord plasma and amni-otic fluid, respectively, indicating that phytoestrogens can cross from the maternal to the fetalcompartment (Adlercreutz et al, 1999). The metabolic clearance of phytoestrogens may be slower in the fetus or neonate due to a relatively low glucuronidation capacity compared to adults. However, theconcentrations detected in this study show in utero concentrations of phytoestrogens approximately 10-fold below those detected in the plasma of infants fed soy infant formula (genistein 2.5 /H9262M; daidzein 1.2 /H9262M (Setchell et al 75 4.4 (18%) 0.2 (27%) 0.2 (90%)935.94 Foster et al (2002) analysed samples of human amniotic fluid in women in their second trimester (15-23 weeks). Dietary phytoestrogens were detected in amniotic fluid of 50 of the 53 women tested. Meanconcentrations of daidzein and genistein were reported to be 5.2 nM (max 20 nM) and 6.7 nM (max26 nM), respectively. Biochanin A was also found at concentrations of 1.8 nM in 8 out of 12 women tested.None of the samples analysed contained quantifiable levels of formononetin or coumestrol. Key points The isoflavones and lignans are ingested mainly as glucosides, which undergo hydrolysis most probably in the small intestine through the action of \u00df-glucosidase enzymes associated with the intestinalmucosa and in the lower bowel by the gut microflora. There is uncertainty on whether the bioavailabilityof isoflavones ingested as glucosides differs from that of the aglucones. The deglycosylated (aglucone)compounds may be further metabolised by the gut bacteria and/ or absorbed. It is clear that the gutmicroflora play a crucial role in determining the absorption, metabolism, re-absorption (enterohepaticcirculation), degradation and excretion of ingested isoflavones and lignans and their metabolites. Once absorbed, these compounds are rapidly and extensively re-conjugated, largely with glucuronic acid, but also with sulfate, and excreted in the bile or urine. Biliary conjugates are thegut further metabolised and/ or reabsorbed (enterohepaticcirculation) or degraded. As a consequence, the activities of gut microflora influence the metabolic profile of phytoestrogens and may influence the bioavailability of phytoestrogens and/ or their metabolites. Since biologicalactivities/potencies of parent molecules and metabolites differ, this could have implications for thedetermination of any ensuing biological response, beneficial or adverse. Few studies have been undertaken that comprehensively describe the pharmacokinetics of ingested isoflavones and lignans. Data indicate considerable in the pharmacokineticand metabolic handling of ingested phytoestrogens. It is clear that the gut microflora greatlyinfluences the exposure to ingested phytoestrogens and their metabolites by determining the extentto which they are absorbed, metabolised, reabsorbed and degraded. This seems to be particularlymarked for the daidzein to equol and enterodiol to enterolactone conversions. Such differences maybe largely attributed to an individual's unique gut microflora, which is influenced by factors includingdiet, particularly fibre content, and intestinal transit time, hygiene, antibiotic use, bowel disease, stress,gut motility, gastric pH, mucin secretion and bile secretion. Gender, age, genetics, food matrix andethnicity may also be determining factors. There is limited information on how phytoestrogens are handled in the newborn and infants. The pharmacokinetics of absorption in the neonate is unclear but it is likely to differ considerably fromthat of the adult, particularly as the gut microflora in neonates is not fully developed. Data on thelevels of isoflavones in the blood of infants fed soy-based formula suggest that they can absorbisoflavones from such formula.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 94 Isoflavones and their metabolites are widely distributed within body fluids, although definitive tissue distribution studies have not been performed in man. There is evidence of transfer of isoflavones andtheir metabolites to the fetal compartment as concentrations similar to those in maternal plasma havebeen detected in umbilical cord plasma and amniotic fluid. There is evidence for transfer ofisoflavones to breast milk viathe maternal diet. No studies on the transfer of lignans to breast milk have been conducted.

J Nutr. 1999,129:957-962.103Introduction 6.1 Oestrogens are hormones involved in regulating the development, growth and function of many tissues in both males and females. Oestrogens act through proteins known as oestrogen receptors. Oestrogenreceptor biology is an area of intense research interest and is far from being completely understood. Asa consequence, the full extent of oestrogen interactions with oestrogen receptors and the resultingbiological responses have yet to be fully elucidated. This chapter summarises what is currently knownabout oestrogen receptors and how oestrogens interact with them. 6.2 As shown in Chapter 3, phytoestrogens have similar chemical structures to the oestrogens and have been found to bind to oestrogen receptors. However, it should be acknowledged that most investigationscontributing to the cellular and molecular action of oestrogens have not employed phytoestrogens,although there is reason to believe they will elicit oestrogenic effects using identical mechanisms. Receptor mediated mechanisms 6.3 Oestrogens are involved in the growth, development and homeostasis of a number of tissues. The physiological effects of these steroids are mediated by ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors, theoestrogen receptors (ERs). The ERs and other steroid hormone receptors are members of the nuclearreceptor family of transcription factors that exhibit common structural domains. ERs are predominantlylocated in the nucleus, although they can move between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, where they arecomplexed with heat shock proteins (hsp56, hsp90 and possibly hsp70) until activated by an appropriateligand. 6.4 Bound ERs dissociate from hsps and subsequently dimerise and undergo a conformational change. The activated dimers have high binding affinities for specific DNA-binding sites called oestrogen receptorresponse elements (ERE) (see Figure 6.1), which are situated in promoter regions upstream of oestrogen-sensitive genes. Proteins known as coactivators or corepressors, are believed to be essential for ER actionand influence the level of expression of oestrogen-responsive genes. Binding to the ERE results in theinitiation or repression of target gene transcription and ultimately elicits a biological response (Clarkeet mechanisms of oestrogen actionCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 104Figure 6.1 A mechanism for the receptor mediated induction of oestrogen responsive genes. Oestrogen receptors can move between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but under normal conditions theyare predominantly located in the nucleus. Upon entering the cell, oestrogens bind to oestrogen receptors(ER) which are complexed with heat shock proteins (hsp). Upon ligand binding (L), the hsps dissociate fromthe receptor, allowing two ERs to dimerise and bind to DNA containing the oestrogen responsive elements(ERE) found within genes responsive to oestrogen. Receptor and ERE binding promotes gene transcriptionand the synthesis of protein which produces an oestrogenic response such as cell proliferation (Adaptedfrom Parker, 1995). Oestrogen response elements (EREs) 6.5 It has been shown that the consensus ERE is a 13-base pair inverted repeat motif consisting of 2 AGGTCA (or minimally GGTCA) inverted repeats separated by 3 nucleotides (Parker, 1995). The symmetry of thesequence facilitates the binding of ER as a homodimer (see Figure 6.2). However, only a small number ofoestrogen-responsive genes contain the consensus sequence. Sequences flanking the ERE may alsoaffect the relative binding of an ER to different EREs. Many genes that contain functional EREs have beenidentified and most of these response elements contain one or more changes from the consensussequence (see Table 6.1). A number of genes have multiple copies of these imperfect EREs. An ERE withER LL LLhsp ER ER ER ERNucleocytoplasmic Shuttling cytoplasm nucleus transcription ERE105a single change from the consensus sequence may be sufficient to prevent binding of the ER (Driscoll et al, 1998). However, an ERE with two changes from the consensus may be capable of binding avidly to ERs in the context of certain flanking sequences. Changes in the sequences flanking a non-consensus ERE canalter ER-ERE interactions, positively or negatively. Different combinations of ERs and ERE sequencescould lead to the association of the receptor with different transcription factors resulting in thedifferential modulation of oestrogen-responsive genes (Wood et al , 1998). Figure 6.2 Models of ER action at a classical ERE and ER-dependent AP1 (activator protein-1) response element.To initiate transcriptional activation, the ligand bound-ER binds to the classical ERE as a homodimer. The ERcan also mediate transcription from an AP1 enhancer element that requires the ligand and the AP1transcription factors Fos and Jun. The filled circles represent ligand-bound to the ER. The AP1 proteins,Jun and Fos are labelled J and F, respectively. Adapted from (Paech et al , 1997). ER ER ER1. ER dimers bind to ERE 2. Modulation of gene transcription 3.

Experiments haveshown that tamoxifen, a drug used in the management of breast cancer, inhibits cell proliferation inbreast tissue but can stimulate cell proliferation in the endometrium. A possible explanation is thatligand-bound ER may have differing transactivation properties when complexed with coactivator orcorepressor proteins. Transactivation experiments lend support to this hypothesis by demonstrating thattamoxifen inhibits the transcription of genes regulated by a classical ERE, but activates the transcriptionof genes under the control of an AP1 element (Paech et al , 1997).

However, a second oestrogen receptor (ER\u00df) has been identified in rat, mouse, primate and man (Enmark et al , 1997; Kuiper 1997; Saunders et al 2000; 2001). A third ER (ER /H9253) has also been identified. The ER /H9253was isolated from teleosts (Hawkins et al, 2000), but the significance of this receptor is not yet clear. Compared to the ER /H9251subtype, ER\u00df may mediate different biological effects and display different intracellular and tissue distribution patterns. ER\u00df also has a different expression pattern during development. The ER /H9251and ER\u00df subtypes can interact with a wide variety of different compounds although some ligands appear tohave different relative affinities for the subtypes. Indeed, although the phytoestrogens can bind to theER/H9251, they appear to bind preferentially to the ER\u00df (see paragraph 6.20-6.23). ER/H9251and ER\u00df: structure and functions 6.8 While the protein sequences of the ER /H9251and ER\u00df are highly homologous, they represent two distinct gene products. In humans, the gene for ER /H9251is located on chromosome 6 while that for ER\u00df is on chromosome 14 (Enmark et al, 1997; Couse & Korach, 1999). The structure of the oestrogen receptors, and other steroid hormone receptors, can be subdivided into several functional domains (see Figure 6.3). TheDNA-binding domain (C) contains two zinc fingers involved in specific DNA-binding and receptordimerisation. This domain is highly conserved between receptors having greater than 94% amino acididentity (3 differing amino acids residues). This suggests the ER /H9251and ER\u00df receptors may interact with similar response elements. The ligand-binding domain (E) contains regions that are important for ligandbinding, receptor dimerisation, nuclear localisation and interactions with transcriptional coactivators andcorepressors (such as AF-2; there may also be an AF-2a domain within the ligand-binding domain (LBD)of human ER /H9251). The LBD is partially conserved, having an amino acid identity of approximately 55% (see Figure 6.4), and both receptors are known to bind oestradiol and other (but not all) ligands with similaraffinity. The N-terminal domain (A/B) is highly variable and usually contains a transactivation function(AF-1). This is thought to be a region of site-specific phosphorylation involved in ligand independentactivity of the receptor. It is possible, therefore, that transcriptional activation of different oestrogen-responsive genes may show variable patterns. The activation of target genes occurs by direct interactionwith components of core transcriptional machinery or with coactivators that mediate signalling to otherproteins. 6.9 The hinge domain (D) contributes flexibility to the DNA- versus ligand-binding domain and may influence DNA-binding of individual receptors or serve to anchor certain corepressor proteins. The C-terminaldomain (F) contributes to the transactivation capacity of the receptor but may have other functions also(Couse & Korach, 1999; Enmark & Gustafsson, 1999). It is now understood that gene activation is influencedby both promoter and cell-specific factors and by synergistic interaction between the N- and C-terminalreceptor activation domains (Enmark & Gustafsson, 1999; Katzenellenbogen & Korach, 1997; Kuiper et al , 1996). It has been proposed that the /H9251and \u00df receptors may be to some extent mutually antagonistic since ER\u00df often appears to quench activities up-regulated by ER /H9251, particularly in the context of cell proliferation but this has only been shown in in vitro cell transfection studies (Reynolds, 1999).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 108Figure 6.3 Structural domains of a generic member of the nuclear receptor family. Five to six distinct domains have been identified in oestrogen receptors, which are responsible for specificfunctions. The functions associated with each of these domains are indicated. Adapted from Gillesby &Zacharewski (1998). Tissue distribution of ER /H9251and ER\u00df 6.10 It is clear that the distribution of ER subtypes varies markedly both between and within the tissues of both humans and rodents (see Table 6.2). In rat and mouse, different regions and cell-populations in thebrain, including the hypothalamus and pituitary, appear to express either ER /H9251or ER\u00df, exclusively, although one minor cell population within the rat pituitary co-expresses both receptors (Couse , 1998; Osterlund et al , 1998). The different cell types within the rat ovary have also been found to exhibit differences in receptor expression and these may be influenced by the stage ofdevelopment or maturation of the animal (Sar & Welsch, 1999; Shughrue et al, 1998). Variable expression profiles of the two receptor types occur within tissues of the developing human fetus (Brandenbergeret al, 1997). Sex differences occur in embryonic brain development in the mouse (Karolczak & Beyer, 1998). Stage-specific changes in expression of oestrogen receptor subtypes have been shown to occur in thedevelopment of pre-implantation mouse embryos (Hiroi et al , 1999). 6.11 Expression of both ER /H9251and ER\u00df has been found in all major human uterine cell types at every menstrual stage. However, expression varies from cell-type to cell-type and expression of ER /H9251mRNA is generally greater than that of ER\u00df (Matsuzaki et al , 1999). Altered expression of oestrogen receptors has been found in certain tumour types. For example, normal human mammary tissue has been shown topredominantly express ER\u00df mRNA, whereas most ER-positive breast tumours appear of ER /H9251:ER\u00df (Leygue et al, 1998; Speirs et al, 1999). Likewise, an increased ratio in ER /H9251:ER\u00df mRNA has been demonstrated in ovarian carcinoma compared with normal tissue or cysts (Pujol et al , 1998). High levels of ER\u00df have also been found within the gut of humans (Enmark et al, 1997).Antagonist Binding Domain Ligand Binding DomainAgonist Binding Domain A/B C D E F Activation Function - 1Nuclear LocalizationSignalActivation Function - 2DNA Binding Domain109Figure 6.4 Percentage amino acid identity between human ER\u00df and other oestrogen receptors: (mER\u00df), human ER /H9251(hER/H9251).

Inoue et al (2000) described a spliced isoform of ER\u00df (ER\u00df /H90045) co-expressed with the wild type in normal human testes. ER\u00df/H90045 contains a deletion of exon 5, predicted to encode the ligand-binding domain in the wild-type receptor. Transient expression of ER\u00df /H90045, in COS-7 cells, had no effect on the basal transactivation activity of an oestrogen-responsive luciferase reporter gene. However, when co-transfected with eitherwild-type ER\u00df or ER /H9251, behaved as a dominant negative receptor inhibiting oestradiol-stimulated transactivation by both ER\u00df and ER /H9251. Moore et al (1998) identified five ER transcripts (hER\u00df 1-5) from a human testis cDNA library and from MDA-MB 435 cells. The isoforms show differential expression inhuman tissues and tumour cell lines at the RNA level, and are predicted to form DNA-binding homo- andheterodimers when co-expressed. 6.13 ER\u00dfcx, from a human testis cDNA library. ER\u00dfcx is identical to ER\u00df except that the C-terminal domain has been replaced by a 26 amino acidsequence. Northern blot analysis showed ER\u00dfcx mRNA expression in testis, ovary, thymus and prostateas well the HEC-1, HOS-TE85 and Saos-2. Radioligand binding assays COS-7 showed that ER\u00dfcx has ligand binding activity. ER\u00dfcx does notshow any ligand-dependent transactivation ability of a basal promoter and cannot interact with TIF1 /H9251, a cofactor, in the presence or absence of oestradiol. The novel isoform was found to preferentially forma heterodimer with ER /H9251rather than ER\u00df, thus inhibiting DNA binding by ER /H9251. ER\u00dfcx also shows significant dominant negative activity against ER /H9251transactivation. 6.14 Vladusic et al (1998) described a variant form of ER\u00df mRNA co-expressed with the wild-type form in a human ER /H9251-negative MDA-MB-231 oestrogen-dependent breast cancer cell line and in malignant breast tumour specimens, but not in samples of normal breast tissue. This ER\u00df variant contained a deletionpredicted to be within the hormone-binding domain, and which, it was suggested, may alter the bindingaffinity for oestradiol. 6.15 Novel isoforms of the ER\u00df receptor have also been identified in the rat (Maruyama et al , 1998; Petersen et al , 1998). The major form, referred to as rER\u00df 2, is putatively a splice variant of ER\u00df which contains an additional 54 base pair insertion in the ligand-binding domain that generates an 18 amino acid residueinsertion in the protein (see Figure 6.4). The insertion resulted in reduced ligand-binding activity foroestradiol, although the ability to bind to the ERE was retained. However, rER\u00df 2failed to activate oestradiol-dependent transcription in an ERE-dependent reporter assay. Furthermore, rER\u00df2 suppressed ER /H9251- and ER\u00df-mediated transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner. It was suggested that rER\u00df2may therefore operate as a negative regulator of oestrogen action. Petersen et al (1998) also detected novel isoforms of both ER\u00df and rER\u00df2mRNAs. Several truncated oestrogen receptor products (TERPs) have identified in rat pituitary (Demay et 1996; 1997; Shupnik et al , 1989) and their expression is also detected in uterus, testes, heart, hypothalamus and liver (Friend et al , 1997).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 1126.16 Several ER /H9251isoforms have been identified, mainly in human cancer cells (Lemieux & Fuqua, 1996; Pfeffer et al , 1996; Karas et al , 1995), but their function is uncertain. Hodges et al (1999) identified 5 variant ER /H9251 transcripts, in addition to the wild-type, in human vascular smooth muscle. All variants containeddeletions of exons encoding regions of the hormone-binding domain. Recently, a further ER /H9251isoform has been identified in humans. This isoform lacks the transactivation function AF-1 and, may regulate cellproliferation (Flouriot et al , 2000). An ER /H9251isoform lacking exon 4 has also been reported in the brain (Skipper et al , 1993). However at this point in time, the implications of these variants for phytoestrogen binding and receptor function is unclear. Homodimers, heterodimers and auxiliary binding proteins 6.17 Differential tissue distribution of ER /H9251and ER\u00df and their variant subtypes may only partly explain the tissue specific effects of oestrogens. Tissue specificity may in fact be attributable to the nature of thedimers formed by receptors and their interaction with accessory proteins. Several groups have reportedthat ER /H9251and ER\u00df can form functional Pettersson et al, 1997). Furthermore, Cowley et al (1997) has demonstrated that heterodimers bind to the consensus ERE sequence with an affinity similar to that of ER /H9251homodimers (Kd 2 nM), but greater than that for ER\u00df homodimers. Consequently there are at least three possible pathways through which oestrogens mayactivate target genes by dimerisation. This gives rise to the possibility that the ratio of different receptortypes present in any particular tissue may be an important determinant of a biological response. Itremains uncertain whether specific response elements exist that are recognised selectively by dimertypes (Enmark & Gustafsson, 1999). However, Hyder et al (1999) reported that ER\u00df to bind ER /H9251 and confer oestrogen inducibility in reporter constructs. It was established that the binding characteristics of ER /H9251and ER\u00df were similar for some EREs but different for others. 6.18 In addition to these possibilities, the auxiliary proteins (coactivators or corepressors), which are required for ER-mediated activation or repression, may also be tissue or receptor specific (Paige et al, 1999). Differential responses from interaction of ER /H9251or ER\u00df with AP1 6.19 It has been shown that ER /H9251and ER\u00df signal in opposite ways from the AP1 site when complexed with the natural hormone oestradiol. With ER\u00df, oestradiol has been found to activate transcription, whereas withER\u00df, oestradiol inhibits transcription. Moreover, anti-oestrogens such as tamoxifen and raloxifene arepotent activators of transcription with ER\u00df at an AP1 site. Thus the two ERs signal in different ways,depending on both ligand and response element (Paech et al , 1997).113Binding of phytoestrogens to oestrogen receptors 6.20 The structure of the oestrogen binding sites of ERs and how oestrogenic ligands bind to ER /H9251and ER\u00df has been determined (Anstead et al, 1997; Brzozowski et al, 1997; Pike et al, 1999). The amino acids within the binding site interact directly with the oestrogen molecule. The strength of these interactions determinesthe affinity of the compound for the receptor. Oestradiol fits into the oestrogen binding pocket well(see Figure 6.5) thus it binds to the ER with high affinity. 6.21 The oestrogen binding site is flexible and can accommodate a wide variety of compounds with structural similarities to oestradiol, such as the phytoestrogens (Brzozowski et al , 1997; et al , Fang et al , 2001; Blair et al , 2000), even those with substituents such as the alkyl group of 8-prenylnaringenin (Milligan et al, 2000). Receptor binding experiments have not been reported for lignans. 6.22 The affinity of phytoestrogens for the ERs is related to their stereochemical structure i.e. the arrangement of the ring structures and the presence and position of chemical groups such as hydroxylgroups (Miksicek, 1993, 1995; Collins et al, 1997; Zava 1997; Breinholt & Larsen, 1998). For example, genistein binds to both oestrogen receptors as it is a similar size to oestradiol and has hydroxylgroups which are appropriately positioned to interact with the amino acids in the binding pockets(see Figure 6.5) (Brzozowski et al , 1997; Pike et al , 1999).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 114Figure 6.5 Oestradiol and genistein binding to the ligand-binding domain of the oestrogen receptor. The figure shows selected interactions (marked with arrows) between oestradiol (A) and genistein (B) andspecific amino acids in the ligand-binding pocket of ER\u00df. (Adapted from Brzozowski et al (1997); Pike et al (1999)). 6.23 Oestradiol binds with equal affinity to both ER\u00df and \u00df (Kuiper et al, 1997). However, the phytoestrogens, coumestrol, genistein and daidzein show greater selectivity towards binding to ER\u00df (see Table 6.3) (Kuiperet al , 1997). The difference in the amino acid sequence between ER /H9251and \u00df accounts for this selectivity (Pike et al , 1999). 8-Prenylnaringenin does not show this selectivity (Milligan et al , 2000). It is unknown whether the lignans have selectivity for one receptor subtype.His 475 of oestradiol and phytoestrogen binding to ER /H9251and ER\u00df The table shows the binding affinities of phytoestrogens to each receptor subtype relative to the bindingaffinity of oestradiol (arbitrarily set at 100). a Kuiper et al (1997) b Milligan et al (2000) Phytoestrogen agonist/antagonist activity 6.24 Different biological responses may occur when a phytoestrogen binds to the oestrogen receptors. If phytoestrogens bind to and activate the receptor this is referred to as agonist activity (Paige et al , 1999). However, a phytoestrogen may bind to the receptor but block a further biological response and this istermed antagonist activity. A major determinant of the potency of agonists or antagonists is their bindingaffinity for the receptor (Clarke et al , 1996). If phytoestrogens induce a biological response at concentrations similar to that of oestradiol they are considered as \"potent\" agonists. Conversely,compounds deemed \"weak\" agonists require much higher concentrations, to produce responses of asimilar magnitude to oestradiol. The same is true for antagonists. Some phytoestrogens are very weakagonists and cannot activate the oestrogen receptors to the same extent as agonists even at highconcentrations and may even have antagonist activity. These compounds are known as partial agonists(see Figure 6.6) (Collins et al , 1997; Mousavi & Adlercreutz, 1992). The oestrogenic potency of phytoestrogens i.e. the ability to elicit an oestrogenic response is discussed in detail in Chapter 8.Additionally, despite binding to oestrogen receptors in a similar way it is possible that oestrogeniccompounds may have somewhat differing biological properties. A recent study by Naciff et al (2002) compared the transcription profile induced in the ovary and uterus of rats after administration of eitherthe synthetic oestrogen, ethinyl oestradiol or genistein. Although the two compounds influenced theexpression of many of the same genes in a similar way, there were some marked differences suggestingthat there may be differences in the biological properties of two oestrogens.Compound Binding at ER /H9251(%) Binding at ER\u00df (%) Coumestrola34 100 Genisteina0.7 13 Daidzeina0.2 1 8-Prenylnaringeninb10 10Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 116Figure 6.6 The relationship between agonists, antagonists and partial agonists. Agonists all produce greater responses with increasing concentration of compound with strong agonistsrequiring lower concentrations to achieve the same effect relative to weak agonists. Partial agonists cannotachieve the maximal effect of agonists no matter how much their concentration is increased. Increasingconcentrations of antagonists reduce the effect of an agonist. Ligand-independent activation of oestrogen receptors 6.25 The oestrogen receptor can also be activated in the absence of a ligand by phosphorylation. Epidermal growth factor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) and insulin are all capable of activatingthe ER through mechanisms involving the Ras signal transduction pathway. This pathway includes themitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and is responsible for the phosphorylation of manyproteins involved in cell signalling. Several studies have shown that phosphorylation by MAPK can bringabout the activation of ER in the absence of ligand (Gillesby & Zacharewski, 1998). Thus, it is possible thatinterference with this pathway may produce oestrogen-like effects without direct ER-ligand interactions. Cell surface oestrogen receptors 6.26 Investigations have suggested that cell-surface forms of ER /H9251and ER\u00df exist which are coupled to cytosolic signal transduction pathways (Collins & Webb, 1999). There is evidence to suggest that thenuclear and membrane ERs are derived from the same transcripts. Recent data have indicated a directlink between cell-surface ERs and the MAPK pathway. This suggests that ERs may be involved in signaltransduction whereby extracellular messages are passed to the nucleus to stimulate gene expressionwith a subsequent rapid biological response. In this way, the effects of oestrogens may be similar tothose of growth factors and may permit cross-talk. Thus, it will be important to establish to what extentsimilar changes can be induced by phytoestrogens (see Figure Partial agonist Weak agonist responseStrong antagonist in the presence of an agonist117Figure 6.7 Proposed mechanisms of rapid actions of oestrogen in four cell types. Oestrogen interacts with the plasma membrane ER of various cell types leading to the sequential activationof signal transduction pathways involving proteins Raf and mitogen-activated proteinkinase (MAPK). Androgen receptors may also interact with the messenger protein c-Src. Activation of variouspathways leads to the types of downstream effects shown. Adapted from Collins & Webb (1999). ER-independent mechanisms mediated through the ERE 6.27 Studies in vitro have shown that heterodimers of other receptors are capable of binding to the EREs. Possible ERE candidates are retinoic acid receptor-peroxisome et 1995). Oestrogen receptor and aromatase knockout mice 6.28 Knockout mice have been developed in which the ER /H9251or ER\u00df genes are inactive, these are known as /H9251ERKO and \u00dfERKO mice. Double knockout mice ( /H9251\u00dfERKO) have also been developed in which both ER /H9251 and ER\u00df are inactive. An aromatase knockout (ArKO) mouse ( oestradiol has been inactivated. The development of these models has done much to increase understanding of oestrogen action andalso helped to unmask unidentified oestrogen signalling systems, including those that are independentof either ER /H9251or ER\u00df (Das et al, 1997). The phenotypes of these genetically modified animals and their use as experimental models in the study of oestrogen action have been reviewed by Couse & Korach(1999), Gustafsson (1999) and MAPK MAPKeNOS MARK/Hsp 90Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 1186.29 In summary, both sexes of the /H9251ERKO mouse are infertile. The female has cystic haemorrhagic follicles and no corpora lutea in the the males exhibit testicular atrophy, decreasedspermatogenesis and inactive sperm. There are also abnormalities in reproductive behaviour and breastdevelopment. Bone tissue is only slightly affected in females and the protective effects of oestrogen onthe cardiovascular system are not overtly affected. Oestradiol levels are greatly elevated, which mayexplain the effects seen in the ovaries. Life-span is comparable to the wild type. The phenotypesobserved in the /H9251ERKO animals are due to oestrogen insensitivity and confirm several functions previously believed to be dependent on ER /H9251. These include: proliferative and differentiative actions required for the function of the adult female reproductive tract and mammary gland, obligatory involvement in growth factor signalling in the uterus and mammary gland, action as a component in the negative regulation of gonadotrophin gene transcription and LH levels in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, actions in the positive regulation of prolactin synthesis and its secretion from the pituitary, progesterone receptor expression in several tissues, action as a promotional factor in oncogene-induced mammary neoplasia, involvement as a crucial component in the differentiation and activation of several behaviours in both the female and the male. 6.30 Certain oestrogen pathways in the /H9251ERKO female appear to remain intact such as the ability of the uterus to exhibit progesterone-induced decidualisation and maintenance of LH surge in thehypothalamus. Some /H9251ERKO phenotypes may be more pronounced by downstream effects of progesterone or prolactin or increased androgen sensitivity. It is also apparent that disruption of the ER /H9251 gene may have unmasked oestrogen-signalling systems that were not easily detectable in the wild-typesuch as those that are independent of both ER /H9251and ER\u00df. 6.31 The ER\u00df-deficient (\u00dfERKO) mouse, has been developed more recently and therefore is less well characterised than the /H9251ERKO mouse. Male \u00dfERKO mice are, as far as is known, fully fertile, although the female mice exhibit reduced fertility due to a block in the last step of follicular development, which maybe overcome when animals are treated with follicle stimulating and luteinising hormones. \u00dfERKO animalsalso exhibit reduced abdominal fat. The use of ER\u00df knockout mice has also established that ER /H9251is instrumental in mediating sexual behaviour in male mice (Lubahn et al , 1993; Ogawa et al , 1999). Studies in /H9251ERKO and \u00dfERKO mice suggest that the two receptors may compensate for each other to a certain extent since the phenotype in some cases is less pronounced than expected such as effects in the testesof \u00dfERKO and in bone of both /H9251ERKO and \u00dfERKO.1196.32 A study by Zhu et al (2002) reported that \u00dfERKO male mice exhibit increased tail-cuff, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (9% increase) after 6-7 and 12 months of age respectively. Blood pressureremained elevated after 22 months in \u00dfERKO male mice. Further to work showing that the predominantER in the heart is ER\u00df, the data demonstrate that ER\u00df and oestrogen affect vascular tone by regulatingion channels, and play an important role in hypertension. 6.33 Aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice are characterised by female infertility as a result of a defect in ovulation that is accompanied by underdeveloped external genitalia, uterus and mammary glands.Oestradiol levels are undetectable while testosterone levels are elevated. In adult males,spermatogenesis and mating ability are impaired thus reducing fertility. Spermatogenesis, however, is notimpaired in younger males although the reasons for this remain to be determined (O'Donnell et al, 2001; Robertson et al , 2001, 1999). Aromatase deficiency in humans is characterised by osteopenia and failure of epipheal closure (Carani , 1997; Morishima et al 1995). Miyaura et al (2001) reported age- and sex-dependent bone loss in ArKO mice. At 4 weeks no defects were noted however, by 9 weeks therewas marked loss of trabecular bone resulting from increased resorption. The degree of bone loss wassimilar for young adult animals of both sexes but was much more severe in older females. In addition,raised serum pyridinoline levels were noted in both sexes suggesting an increase in bone turnover. Incontrast, a study by Oz et al (2000) reported differences in bone turnover between males and females with ArKO females exhibiting increased turnover whilst males showed decreased turnover with thesuppression of bone formation. Double Oestrogen receptor knockout (DERKO or /H9251\u00dfERKO) mice 6.34 The generation of mice that do not express either ER /H9251or ER\u00df (double knockout mice or DERKO), has provided further information on the role of these receptors in regulating physiological and behaviouralprocesses. Studies have shown that in male mice, ER /H9251is instrumental in regulating bone growth and maturation (Vidal et al , 2000), thymus and spleen development (Erlandsson et al , 2001) and the development of obesity (Ohlsson et al , 2000). 6.35 The role of both ER /H9251and ER\u00df in the sexual behaviour and aggression of male mice has been studied in double knockout animals (Ogawa et al , 2000; Simpson & Davis, 2000). These experiments assessed the mating ability and aggressiveness of male mice. Mating ability was measured by recording mount,ejaculation and intromission frequency whilst aggressiveness was measured by recording behaviouralresponses after introduction of other male mice unable to respond to aggressive behaviour due to theabsence of a functional olfactory system. 6.36 The results demonstrate that the absence of both ER /H9251and ER\u00df significantly reduces sexual and aggressive behaviour. However, the observation of reduced intromissions and ejaculations but normal sexual behaviourin ER/H9251or ER\u00df knockout mice suggests that one receptor may partially compensate for the other. The level of aggressiveness recorded in double knockout animals was very similar to that seen in ER /H9251knockout mice. ER\u00df knockout mice however, have been shown to have increased aggressive behaviour suggesting that ER\u00dfmay have an inhibitory effect on ER /H9251mediated functions (Ogawa et al, 2000).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 1206.37 At present it is unclear how these results may be interpreted in light of data on the localisation of ER /H9251 and ER\u00df in the brain. Both ERs are present in the arcuate nucleus and the preoptic area of thehypothalamus. ER /H9251is present in the ventromedial nucleus and ER\u00df in the paraventricular nucleus. These regions of the hypothalamus are important in feeding behaviour, reproduction, sexual behaviour, andthermoregulation. Both receptors also appear to be present in the amygdala and hippocampus, areasinvolved in short term memory and emotion. ER\u00df has also been identified in the cerebellum and incortical regions (Kuiper et al , 1997; Shughrue et al , 1998). 6.38 The creation of these models has done much to increase our understanding of oestrogen action and also helped to identify new oestrogen-signalling systems, including those pathways independent of eitherER/H9251or ER\u00df. Studies using DERKO mice exposed to phytoestrogens that will help to differentiate between responses by ER /H9251and ER\u00df have yet to be conducted. Key points Oestrogens produce their effects by interacting with oestrogen receptors (ERs) predominantly located in nucleus of the cell. Two main isoforms of ER have been identified as ER /H9251and ER\u00df, although additional variants such as ER\u00df2 have also been identified in the rat. The receptors are composed offive distinct functional domains, each of which has a different function. Experiments have shown thereis some degree of amino acid homology between the receptors, with respect to the DNA-bindingdomain (greater than 94% homology) and to a lesser extent in the ligand-binding domain (55%homology). When an oestrogen molecule binds to an ER, it dimerises. The dimerised receptor binds to the oestrogen response element (ERE), a particular DNA sequence contained within specific genes. Bindingto the ERE causes a conformational change in the receptor thus, initiating gene expression and resultingin a biological response for example increased gene expression. ERs may also interact with other DNA sequences such as AP1, which may widen the role these receptors play in mediating the effects of oestrogenic compounds. There is also evidence thatoestrogenic responses may occur by non-genomic mechanisms that permit cross-talk between othernuclear receptors and cellular signalling systems.121 Phytoestrogens possess hydroxyl and phenolic groups spaced at a similar distance to those in the oestradiol structure. The chemical structure of phytoestrogens determines their affinity, selectivityand efficacy of their binding to oestrogen receptors. Genistein, coumestrol, and daidzein all show greater selectivity for binding to ER\u00df relative to ER /H9251. The generation of transgenic mice that do not posses ER /H9251, ER\u00df or aromatase enzymes will provide additional information on the role of these factors in development and reproduction and, what effectoestrogenic compounds may have on these animals.

Phytoestrogens may alsoinduce effects, which may not be mediated through oestrogen receptors. This chapter summarises theinformation on the oestrogenic and non-oestrogenic mechanisms of action of phytoestrogens. Effects on oestrogen bioavailability 7.2 Circulating oestradiol is bound primarily to glycoproteins in blood, such as sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in humans or to /H9251-fetoprotein (AFP) in rats and mice (Baker et al , 1998). In adult women, approximately 37% of circulating oestradiol is associated with serum albumin. Only freeor unbound oestradiol is available to be taken up into cells and thus, elicit biological effects.Consequently, the binding of hormone to serum proteins provides a mechanism by which cellular uptakeand responses in target tissues can be limited (Nagel et al, 1998; 1999). The majority of testosterone (97%) present in plasma is bound to proteins, of this 40% is bound to SHBG. Thus, SHBG binding to bothtestosterone and oestrogen contributes to the total active steroid concentration in vivo . 7.3 It has been suggested that phytoestrogens may alter the concentrations of active sex hormone by: binding to SHBG to inhibit binding of oestrogens (and androgens) to increase their plasma concentrations i.e. an oestrogenic effect (or androgenic effect). stimulating the synthesis of SHBG thus, reducing the concentrations of free hormones i.e. an anti- oestrogenic effect. While it is possible that phytoestrogens may displace oestrogens or androgens from SHBG or alter the concentration of SHBG available to bind oestrogens and androgens, there are no data to suggestphytoestrogens act by this mechanism to produce clinical effects (see paragraphs 7.6-7.13). Influence of phytoestrogens on hormone binding to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) 7.4 Isoflavones and lignans bind to SHBG with a lower than oestradiol (Nagel et al , 1998; 1999). Dechaud et al (1999) investigated the binding of genistein and its glucoside (genistin) to human SHBG (hSHBG). binding of testosterone andoestradiol to hSHBG with IC 50values of 11.5 and 4.5 /H9262M, respectively. Milligan et al (1998) reported that concentrations of /H11022100 /H9262M genistein, daidzein and coumestrol were required to competitively inhibit binding of oestradiol and dihydrotestosterone from steroid binding proteins. A study by Martin et al (1996) reported that phytoestrogen IC50values of 10-50 /H9262M inhibited testosterone /H11022/H11022 enterodiol, daidzein. Thus, it is unlikely that such effects would occur in vivo as plasma concentrations of phytoestrogens are /H110215/H9262M and would be present predominantly in conjugated form (see Chapter 5) and which are unable to bindto SHBG.7 . Additional effects mediated by phytoestrogensCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 130Influence of phytoestrogens on sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) In vitro studies 7.5 It has been shown that phytoestrogens can modulate the levels of hSHBG in vitro (Mousavi & Adlercreutz, 1993). Adlercreutz and co-workers demonstrated that lignans and isoflavones can increaseboth the synthesis and secretion of liver et al, 1995; also reported that enterolactone (1-10 /H9262M) stimulated the synthesis of hSHBG up to 50%, in a dose dependent manner but that higher concentrations ofenterolactone (50 /H9262M) inhibited synthesis (Adlercreutz et al , 1992). They also showed that genistein (5-30 /H9262M) dose dependently induced hSHBG production up to under similar culture conditions (Mousavi & Adlercreutz, 1993). Loukovaara et al (1995) found that 5 /H9262M concentrations of daidzein, genistein, equol and oestradiol (250 nM) increased hSHBG concentrations without increasing hSHBGmRNA. The authors suggested that phytoestrogen regulation of hSHBG occurs by post-transcriptionalregulation. Studies in pre-menopausal women 7.6 Adlercreutz et al (1987; 1998) reported a positive correlation between SHBG concentrations, fibre intake and the urinary excretion of lignans and isoflavones in a study of 62 women. 7.7 In contrast, no effects on SHBG or sex hormone levels were observed in a randomised crossover trial (n= 14) when diets were supplemented by 64 and 128 mg isoflavones per day for 3 menstrual cycles(Duncan et al , 1999a). A randomised crossover trial (n= 18) investigating the effect of flaxseed ingestion, also failed to show any effect on SHBG concentrations although a 30-fold increase in urinaryenterolactone excretion was observed (Phipps et al, 1993). In addition, a cross-sectional study by Nagata et al (1997) failed to show an association between soy intake (38 /H1100626 g/ day) and SHBG levels measured on days 11 and 22 of the menstrual cycle (n= 50). Studies by Cassidy et al (1994) and Martini et al (1999) did not observe any significant changes in SHBG concentrations following dietary supplementation withsoy (n= 6 and 36, respectively). 7.8 A study by Duncan et al (2000) demonstrated that subjects (n= 50) able to metabolise daidzein to the more potent oestrogen equol had lower concentrations of testosterone (30%) and higher levels of SHBG(50%) than non-equol producers (n= 9). However, correlatedwith urinary equol concentration.131Studies in post-menopausal women 7.9 A marginal effect of isoflavone consumption on SHBG or plasma sex hormone levels was observed following ingestion of 65 or 132 mg/ day isoflavones for 93 days each in a randomised cross-over trial (n= 18) (Duncan et al , 1999b). No significant changes in SHBG, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or luteinising hormone (LH) levels were observed in a randomised study (n= 97) consisting of four weeks ofconsumption of a soybean-supplemented diet containing 165 mg/ day isoflavones (Baird et al , 1995). 7.10 Adlercreutz et al (1992) observed a positive correlation between plasma SHBG and urinary excretion 0.4) in three groups of post-menopausalwomen (11 omnivores, 10 vegetarians and 9 women with history of breast cancer). 7.11 An increase in SHBG levels was observed (r= 0.85) in a dietary intervention study when women received 30 g of soy milk (69 mg isoflavones/ day) for 10 weeks. Plasma concentrations of isoflavones rose from0.014 /H110060.01 /H9262M at baseline to 0.53 /H110060.19 /H9262M at the end of the study (Pino et al , 2000). Plasma levels of SHBG were also increased in women (n= 145) whose diet was supplemented with phytoestrogen richfoodstuffs for 12 weeks (Brzezinski et al , 1997). A mean 25% increase in plasma SHBG was also observed in women (n= 312) receiving a low saturated fat and carbohydrate, high mono and polyunsaturated fattyacid and phytoestrogen-rich diet (Berrino et al , 2001). Studies in men 7.12 The effects on sex hormone and SHBG levels when replacing meat (150 g/ day) with tofu (290 g/ day) in isoenergetic diets was investigated in isoflavone levelsincreased 19-fold and levels increased 9% on the tofu diet (Habito et al , 2000). In a cross- sectional study (n= 69, aged /H1109135) reported soy intake was inversely associated with serum oestradiol concentration (r= -0.32). However, changes in SHBG were not statistically significant (Nagata et al, 2000). 7.13 A dietary intervention study (n= 7, aged 25-42 years) by Shultz et al (1991) investigated the effects of flaxseed consumption (57 /H9262mol urinary lignans/ day) for 2 weeks. Concentrations of free testosterone or SHBG did not significantly alter from baseline levels. Effects on oestrogen biosynthesis and metabolism 7.14 A number of enzymes are involved in oestrogen synthesis and metabolism (see Figure 7.1). It is possible that phytoestrogens may modulate steroid concentrations by binding to these enzymes to inhibit theiractivity. However, there are limited data in this area and the Food Standards Agency is currently fundinga research project examining the effect of phytoestrogens on steroid metabolising enzymes.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 132Figure 7.1 Enzymes involved in oestrogen biosynthesis and metabolism. Adapted from Kirk et al (2001). Inhibition of 17\u00df-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductases I and II 7.15 The 17\u00df-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase (17\u00df-HSOR) enzymes, occur as two isoforms (I and II), involved in the inter-conversion of oestrone to the more active oestrogen, oestradiol. 17\u00df-HSOR I and II are keyenzymes in oestrogen biosynthesis and metabolism and are expressed selectively in steroidogenic andsome oestrogen sensitive tissues. The type I enzyme converts oestrone to oestradiol and type IIcatalyses the reverse reaction. Therefore, inhibition of 17\u00df-HSOR I reduces concentrations of oestradiolconverting it to the less active oestrogen, oestrone (an anti-oestrogenic effect), whereas inhibition of thereverse been found to inhibit both 17\u00df-HSOR enzymes in vitro and have shown a selectivity which is structure dependent (Makela et al , 2002). The position and number of hydroxyl groups on the isoflavone structure appear to be the principaldeterminant of activity. Compounds with hydroxyl groups at the 5, 7 and 4' positions were the mostpotent inhibitors of 17\u00df-HSOR I and compounds with hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 5 and 7, inhibited17\u00df-HSOR II (see Figure 7.2). In addition, hydroxylation at position 3, or methylation of the hydroxyl groupat position 4' reduced 17\u00df-HSOR I activity while hydroxylation at position 3 reduced 17\u00df-HSOR II activity.The IC 50values of these compounds for inhibition of 17\u00df-HSOR I and II are in the range 0.1-1 /H9262M (Makela et al , 1998). Thus, phytoestrogens may alter the activities 17\u00df-HSOR I and II to shift the equilibrium concentrations of oestrone and oestradiol. However, the direction of this equilibrium shift is dependenton phytoestrogen structure. Figure 7.2 Potential hydroxylation position on the isoflavone structure. The numbers correspond to the ring positions. Aromatase inhibition 7.17 Aromatase is an enzyme converting androgen to oestrogen. Lignans, flavones and, lesser extent, isoflavones, can inhibit cytochrome P450aromatase (CYP19) in a competitive manner and therefore, may increase the ratio of endogenous androgen to oestrogen(Adlercreutz et al , less effective aromatase inhibitors compared with flavones e.g. naringenin (Kao et al, 1998) (see Table 7.1) and the high concentrations ( /H11091100 /H9262M) of isoflavones required to inhibit aromatase in vitro are unlikely to be achieved in vivo following dietary exposure to phytoestrogens.OO 1234 8765 2'3'4'5' 6' 1'Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 134Table 7.1 Aromatase inhibition by phytoestrogens. Adapted from Kao et al (1998). Inhibition of glucuronidation 7.18 Zhu et al (1998) reported the inhibition of oestrone and oestradiol glucuronidation in vitro by polyphenols and flavonoids in rat liver microsomal fractions. The most potent compounds were foundto inhibit with an IC 50of approximately 25 /H9262M. Flavonoids have also been shown to induce phase I and II drug metabolising enzymes in rats including p-nitrophenol UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (Siess et al , 1996). Consequently, it is possible that inhibition of glucuronidation activity may be counteracted byincreased synthesis of the enzyme in this species (e.g. rat liver). However, the effects of phytoestrogenshave not been evaluated for either inhibition or induction of glucuronosyl transferase activity. and sulfotransferase 7.19 Steroid sulfotransferase catalyses the addition of sulfate to steroid-like compounds and steroid sulfatase catalyses the reverse reaction. The equilibrium between these opposing reactions usually lies towardsthe sulfated compounds and their concentrations are 10-30-fold higher than the unconjugatedforms (Harris et al , 2000). Steroid sulfatase activity is of particular importance to post-menopausal women as it produces biologically active oestrogens from the less active oestrone sulfate anddehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate in breast tissue. In many breast cancer tumours, oestrogensulfotransferase activity is lower than in normal tissue, and this may account for the increased sensitivityof breast tumours to oestrogen (Qian et al, 1998). A project in the Food Standards Agency phytoestrogen research programme is currently evaluating whether other phytoestrogens and their sulfated metabolitesare effective inhibitors of these enzymes. Should phytoestrogens selectively inhibit one of theseenzymes this would alter the respective concentrations of active and inactive oestrogens withpotentially potent effects depending on the enzyme localisation in tissues. Results published fromthis study indicate that genistein and daidzein are potent inhibitors of oestradiol sulfation in vitro . In contrast, these compounds were poor inhibitors of steroid sulfatase (see Table 7.2). This suggests thatthey may act to either reduce the concentrations of sulfated steroids or, conversely, to increase theconcentration of active steroids in peripheral tissues, depending on the location of the affected enzymes(Kirk et al , genistein 123 /H1100681357.20 Harris et al (2000) reported that 4- p-ethylphenol, a metabolite of genistein can act as a sulfotransferase substrate. However it remains to be determined if dietary phytoestrogens can generate sufficient 4- p- ethylphenol to reduce the activity of these enzymes in target tissues. Wong & Keung (1997)demonstrated that daidzein sulfoconjugates are potent inhibitors of steroid sulfatase andsulfotransferases (see Table 7.2). Table 7.2 Steroid sulfatase and sulfotransferase inhibition by phytoestrogens. aData from Kirk et al (2001); bData from Wong & Keung (1997). Effects on oestrogen production 7.21 The production of endogenous oestrogens is controlled in the central nervous system by the secretion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. GnRH follicle lutenising hormone(LH). Following their release, LH and FSH stimulate the maturation of the ova resulting in increasedconversion of testosterone to oestradiol by the enzyme, aromatase. When sufficient levels of oestradiolhave been reached, oestradiol exerts a negative feedback effect on the hypothalamus inhibiting furthersecretion of GnRH. The role of hormones in the production of sex hormones is explained in more detailin Chapter 9. 7 .22 Experiments have shown that phytoestrogens may modulate the endogenous production of oestrogen. Ashby et al (2000) demonstrated that soy-based formulae elicited oestrogenic effects in an ovariectomised mouse model (see Chapter 8 for further details of this experimental system). Theoestrogenic effects of soy-based formulae, diethylstilboestrol (FAS) was implicating oestrogen receptorsin the response (see Figure 7.3). Antarelix (ANT) blocked the action of GnRH as a result of exposure tosoy-based formulae but not DES or oestradiol. Also the (ANAS)abolished isoflavones soy-based not Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 136oestrogen receptors but via stimulation of the central nervous system by hypothalamic GnRH and subsequent production of endogenous oestrogens mediated by gonadotrophins released from thepituitary. However, similar oestrogenic effects were observed with cows' milk formulae and aphytoestrogen free rodent diet. The same inhibitors also abolished the oestrogenic effects. This suggeststhe oestrogenic effects observed may be mediated via dietary factors other than isoflavones. Thus,direct effects of isoflavones on oestrogen production by a centrally mediated mechanism remain to beestablished. Figure 7.3 Investigation of centrally mediated oestrogenic effects of phytoestrogens. The mechanisms responsible for the uterotrophic effects of soy-based formulae were investigated usingselective pharmacological inhibitors of sex hormone production and action. The oestrogenic effects of theformulae were abolished by the ER the aromatase anastrasole and the GnRHinhibitor, antarelix suggesting that the oestrogenic effects are mediated by stimulation of GnRH productionresulting in increased production of endogenous oestrogens rather than by direct interaction with oestrogenreceptors in the ovary. Blocked by AntarelixPhytoestrogens or GnRH GnRH pregnane X receptor 7.23 The pregnane X receptor (PXR) has also been described as the steroid X receptor and is highly expressed in the liver and intestine of mammalian species, including man. The receptor is activated by a diverserange of chemicals, including natural and synthetic steroids and induces the expression of CYP3A genes.In addition to modulating this xenobiotic metabolising capacity it is thought that PXR can also modulateCYP3A expression in response to endogenous hormones (Waxman, 1999; Savas et al , 1999). It has been suggested that PXR may act to monitor steroid and xenobiotic concentrations and upregulate genes thatmetabolise such compounds. Since PXR is expressed mainly in the gut and liver, exposure to dietaryphytoestrogens could result in the increased metabolism of endogenous oestrogens. 7.24 There are differences in the structure of the PXR ligand-binding domain (LBD) between species. Rabbit, rat and human receptors share only /H1101180% amino acid homology in the ligand binding domain of the receptor (Jones et al, 2000). Mouse LBD PXR shares 95% sequence identity with rat but 79% with human (Zhang et al , 1999). Thus, the receptors between species can respond to chemicals differently (Blumberg et al , 1998; Lehmann et al , 1998; Jones et al , 2000). Blumberg et al , (1998) demonstrated that human PXR was activated by coumestrol whereas the mouse PXR was not. Therefore, the different compoundspecificities between human and rodent PXR may result in species differences in the metabolism andtherefore, the potency of phytoestrogens in rodents and humans (Moore & Kliewer, 2000). Thyroid peroxidase 7.25 Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is an enzyme involved in the production of thyroid hormones. TPO catalyses the oxidation of iodide to iodine radical allowing iodination of tyrosines during synthesis of thyroidhormones, tri-iodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T4). In vitro studies suggest that some phytoestrogens may inhibit TPO activity to reduce the concentrations of thyroid hormones. Genistein, daidzein andbiochanin A inhibited TPO catalysed thyroid hormone synthesis in vitro by acting as alternative substrates for iodination (see Table 7.3) (Divi et al , 1997; Divi & Doerge, 1996). Addition of iodine reduced this effect. If such inhibition were to occur in vivo , concentrations of thyroid hormones would be reduced and potentially stimulate the production of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).The implications of the interactions between phytoestrogens and thyroid peroxidase are describedin Chapter 10.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 138Table 7.3 Inhibition of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) catalysed thyroid hormone synthesis by phytoestrogens.Data from Divi et al (1997) and Divi & Doerge (1996). Inhibition of topoisomerase II in vitro 7.26 DNA topoisomerase II is a nuclear enzyme involved in replication, transcription, recombination, integration and transposition (Okura et al, 1988). Topoisomerase II catalyses the relaxation of supercoiled DNA, separating the two strands of DNA by breaking and joining DNA strands in ATP-dependentreactions (Bjergbaek et al , 2000; Wang et al , 2001). This allows the genes to be manipulated during replication and gene expression. Therefore, topoisomerase II plays an integral role in cell growth anddeath and is likely to mediate events that occur when cells are exposed to cytotoxic agents. Inhibitionof topoisomerase II may disrupt progression through the cell cycle and initiate apoptosis. 7.27 A number of studies have shown that genistein can interact with topoisomerase II in vitro (Kaufmann et al , (3.7 /H9262M) stabilises the topoisomerase II-DNA complex. Markovits et al (1989) and Yamashita et al (1990) showed that genistein induced stabilisation of this complex, stimulating topoisomerase II dependent DNA cleavage (in the ranges 80-370 /H9262M 12.5-250 50 /H9262M) inhibited unwinding of DNA by topoisomerase II in primary hematopoietic cells and stimulated strand breakage. Robinson et al (1993) investigated the effect of genistein on the DNA cleavage and ATP hydrolysis steps of the topoisomerase II catalysed reactions.Genistein inhibited enzyme-catalysed hydrolysis with an IC 50of 7 /H9262M. However, genistein did not stimulate DNA cleavage (Robinson et al , 1993). Further studies by Strick et al (2000b) showed that genistein (50 /H9262M) and daidzein (100 /H9262M) induced cleavage of the MLL gene in primary hematopoietic cells. Further in vitro experiments suggested that inhibition of topoisomerase II catalysed re-ligation of DNA strand breaks as the mechanism of action. Inhibition of topoisomerase II in vivo 7.28 There is no direct evidence for genistein interactions with topoisomerase II in vivo . However, Record et al (1997) and Zhou et al (1998) have suggested that genistein inhibition of topoisomerase II accounts for the chemo-protective effects observed in rodents treated with genistein. Record et al (1997) demonstratedCompound Concentration ((M) % Inhibition Genistein 3.2 50 Daidzein 7 .6 50 15 Flavanone /H110221500 2 Flavone /H110222000 7139tumour growth in female mice implanted with B16 melanoma cells was inhibited by 50% when fed a diet containing 1 mg/ day genistein. 7.29 Zhou et al (1998) showed similar effects in mice implanted with mouse bladder carcinoma cells. Genistein administered by intraperitoneal injection (50 mg/kg bw/ day) or in feed (either 0.2-1% (w/w)soy concentrate or 20% (w/w) soy protein isolate) reduced tumour volumes by 40% and 1%, respectively.These treatments reduced cell growth, increased apoptosis and prevented angiogenesis, in the absenceof toxicity in the normal bladder epithelia. Record et al (1997) and Zhou et al (1998) propose that genistein inhibition of topoisomerase II induced apoptosis with concomitant chemo-protective effects. Inhibition of protein kinases 7.30 Protein kinases are essential enzymes for cellular growth and differentiation. They allow cells to respond to external stimuli through signal transduction pathways by catalysing the phosphorylation of serine,threonine and tyrosine residues in proteins (for review see Scott & Pawson, 2000). A number of studieshave shown that genistein can inhibit tyrosine kinases in vitro . 7.31 Akiyama et al (1987) demonstrated that genistein (150 /H9262M) inhibited tyrosine kinase activity by binding to the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Genistein (100 /H9262M) suppressed growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in response to insulin by inhibiting insulin induced tyrosine kinase activity (Pagliacci et al , 1994). Spinozzi et al (1994) demonstrated that genistein dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of a leukaemia cell line with a constitutively increased tyrosine phosphorylation pattern. Genistein (in /H9262M) tyrosine kinase activity, S-phase progression and inducing G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Dalu et al (1998) demonstrated that increasing concentrations of genistein in the diet (250-1000 mg/kg diet) inhibited tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 85 and 170 kDin rat prostate. Genistein (1000 mg/kg diet) repressed the expression of EGF (epidermal growth factor -a protein involved in cellular proliferation) and its phosphorylation product by 50% and inhibitedexpression of ER /H92522. However, kinase inhibition may be cell dependent and modulated by the concentrations of oestradiol and other growth factors suggesting that genistein may not consistentlyinhibit tyrosine kinase (Panno et al, 1996; 1995; Peterson & Barnes, 1993; Peterson & Barnes 1996; Peterson et al , 1996; Twaddle et al, 1999). Effects on cellular growth and differentiation 7.33 The effects of genistein on cell growth and cell cycle progression have been investigated in vitro . Genistein (10-60 /H9262M) inhibited the growth of a human gastric cancer cell line (HGC-27) in a dose- dependent manner with cell cycle arrest at the G2/M-phase (Matsukawa et al , 1993). G2/M arrest was also observed in multi-drug resistant human Jurkat and mouse leukaemia cells treated with genistein(40/H9262M) (Finlay et al , 1994). Spinozzi et al /H9262M) arrested the cell cycle at G2/M-phase arrest in colon cancer cells inducing apoptosis (Salti et al , 2000). Similar results were found in humanCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 140myelogenous leukemia HL-60 and lyphocytic leukemia MOLT-4 cells at concentrations genistein 20/H9262M (Traganos et al , 1992). Zava & Duwe (1997) found that MCF-7 cells proliferated when exposed to 1 nM-10 /H9262M genistein but inhibited cell growth at concentrations /H1102210 /H9262M. Hsieh et al (1998) also demonstrated that genistein (0.01-1 /H9262M) increased cell growth in a dose-dependent manner but at concentrations /H1102225-100 /H9262M, cell growth was inhibited. Genistein (10 /H9262M) increased the protein content, alkaline phosphatase activity and DNA content of metaphyseal tissues isolated from female rats(Yamaguchi & Gao, 1998) and in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells (Sugimoto & Yamaguchi, 2000). Cellproliferation has also been observed Constantinou & Huberman (1995) studied the genistein-induced celldifferentiation in several cell lines. Genistein (3.7-92 /H9262M) inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. However, a number of cell lines were shown to differentiate (Constantinou & Huberman 1995).Peterson & Barnes (1991) demonstrated that genistein-inhibited growth in human breast cancer cell lines(IC 50 ranging from 24-44 /H9262M). Similar results in an oestrogen receptor negative cell line suggested inhibition was not receptor mediated. In vitro evidence that phytoestrogens inhibit cell growth and induce differentiation use concentrations that are unattainable through normal dietary consumption inhumans and therefore these results are not applicable in vivo . Genotoxic effects of phytoestrogens 7.34 The genotoxic and mutagenic properties of a number of phytoestrogens have been investigated in a number of in vitro systems. Kulling & Metzler (1997) daidzein did not. Coumestrol (25-100 /H9262M) also induced DNA breaks in a dose-dependent manner. Daidzein did not induce strand breakage over this concentration range and genistein was not tested in this study. 7.35 Coumestrol (5-50 induced /H9262M) and daidzein (100 /H9262M) also increased mutation frequency in this gene significantly above controls (Kulling & Metzler 1997). Boos & Stopper (2000) assessed the genotoxicity ofgenistein using the micronucleus, single cell respectively in these assays. Similar results were reported by Morris et al (1998). Coumestrol (50-75 /H9262M) and genistein (25 /H9262M) in cultured lymphocytes (Kulling et al , 1999). Strand breakage induced by genistein and daidzein was investigated using the comet assay (Andersonet al , 1997). Exposure to genistein and daidzein resulted in weak and variable DNA damage. Misra et al (2002) assessed the in vitro mutagenicity of and 1/1 mammalian mutation assays after addition of metabolising systems. 7.36 The results of a study by Mitchell et al (2000) showed that genistein, daidzein, coumestrol and equol cause growth inhibition of PC-3 prostate cells at concentrations of /H1102110 /H9262M. Inhibition of LNCaP cells occurred at lower concentrations than PC-3 cells. Exposure to genistein causedDNA strand breakage at concentrations /H3289510 /H9262M in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells. DNA damage was not141observed when cells were treated with daidzein. High to cause DNA strand breakage in both cell lines. In addition, genistein (5 /H9262M) was found to protect against H2O2-induced DNA strand breakage in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. 7.37 The in vivo mutagenicity of isoflavones has been investigated in only one study (Misra et al, 2002). Small non-dose dependent increases in micronuclei were reported at one time-point in male but not femalemice fed genistein (0-1000 mg/kg diet) in the mouse micronucleus assay. The authors reported similarfindings in historical control animals. In addition, there were no differences in the incidence, multiplicityor spectrum of tumours in either male or female p53 (-/-) mice fed genistein (50 mg/kg bw/ day)compared with control animals. This study suggests that genistein at dietary levels is not mutagenicin vivo . Anti-oxidant properties of phytoestrogens 7.38 Highly reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals, have been shown to damage DNA, cellular proteins and lipids to play a role in the development of cancer (see Chapter 15). In addition, oxidation oflipids has been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease (see Chapter 13). It has beensuggested that isoflavones and lignans possess antioxidant properties Wei, et al (1993). A study by Harper et al (1999) investigated the antioxidant capability of genistein, equol, enterolactone and enterodiol using an in vitro system to measure the inhibition of free radical induced DNA damage. The rank order of inhibition of DNA damage was genistein /H11022equol /H11022enterolactone and enterodiol. However, the concentrations required were higher than those likely to occur in vivo from dietary exposure to phytoestrogens (i.e. IC 50for genistein was 9 /H9262M). 7.39 Wei et al (1995) investigated the antioxidant properties of the phytoestrogen genistein. Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide free radical production was efficiently inhibited by genistein at concentrations of5 and 50 /H9262M, respectively in vitro assays. 7.40 Studies have suggested that phytoestrogens may protect against lipid peroxidation. Genistein was found to inhibit lipid peroxidation at concentrations and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation at concentrations /H1102220 /H9262M but had no effect on lipid hydroperoxide concentrations (Patel et al , 2001). In an in vitro study by Wilson et al (2002), genistein and daidzein significantly inhibited LDL oxidation at 10/H9262M but not 1 /H9262M. Similarly, Hodgson et al (1996) showed that the daidzein metabolites, equol and O-desmethylangolensin were more potent inhibitors of lipoprotein oxidation than daidzein or genistein at concentrations of 10 /H9262M. Ascorbic acid has also been shown to enhance the inhibitory effects of genistein, daidzein and equol on LDL oxidation in vitro (Hwang et al , 2000). 7.41 A study by Arora et al (1998) compared the ability of genistein, genistin, daidzein, daidzin, biochanin A, formononetin /H9262M) to inhibit lipid peroxidation in vitro . The rank order of /H11022daidzin the number and position of hydroxyl groups appear to be determining factors for antioxidant activity.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 1427.42 In a study in mice with increased susceptibility to skin tumours, dietary genistein (250 mg/kg diet) administration for 30 days increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione- S-transferase (enzymes involved in free radical scavenging) in the skin (Cai & Wei, 1996). 7.43 The antioxidant effects of phytoestrogens have been investigated in a number of human dietary trials. In a randomised cross-over trial, hyperlipidemic patients (19 men and 12 postmenopausal women) were fedsoy (86 mg isoflavones/ day) for 4 weeks. Decreases in oxidised LDL concentrations in blood (p /H110210.001) were reported after dietary soy supplementation (Jenkins et al , 2000). 7.44 The oxidation rate of LDL fractions from subjects (n= 6) was tested ex vivo before and after consumption of soy (12 mg genistein and 7 mg daidzein/ day) for 14 days. Dietary soy reduced the rate of LDL oxidation(p/H110210.02) compared with baseline measurements (Tikkanen et al, 1998). Similarly, in a study by Kanazawa et al (1995), ingestion of soy (isoflavone content not determined) appeared to reduce lipoprotein peroxidation tested ex vivo in samples from subjects (n= 10) compared with controls (p /H110210.05). 7.45 In a randomised trial, men were fed soy milk (n= 4), rice milk (n= 3) or cows' milk (n= 3) for 4 weeks (Mitchell et al , 1999). Dietary soy supplementation reduced oxidative DNA base damage (but not peroxide induced DNA strand breaks) in lymphocytes from the soy fed group compared with the othergroups (p /H110210.05), as assessed ex vivo using the Comet assay. 7.46 In a randomised cross-over trial, reductions in plasma 8- epi-prostaglandin F 2/H9251(a biomarker for (p= 0.017) tested ex vivo were seen in blood samples from subjects (n= 24) that had consumed soy (56 mg isoflavones) compared with alcoholextracted soy (2 mg isoflavones) for 17 days (Wiseman et al , 2000). 7.47 There was no difference in the oxidisability of LDL fractions tested ex vivo between test and control groups in a randomised cross-over trial in women (n= 14) consuming isoflavones (86 mg/ day) for2 menstrual cycles (Samman et al , 1999). 7.48 These human studies suggest that supplementation of the diet with soy may produce antioxidant effects such as inhibition of LDL oxidation. However, this property may not be attributable to the phytoestrogencontent of soy.143Key points It is possible that phytoestrogens may produce oestrogenic effects, which occur by mechanisms other than direct interaction with oestrogen receptors. Phytoestrogens may stimulate secretion of hormones from the central nervous system to increase concentrations of oestrogens. Phytoestrogens may also modulate the concentrations of endogenous hormones by: inhibition of hormone binding to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which increases the concentrations of active oestradiol and testosterone. stimulation of SHBG synthesis which can reduce concentrations of endogenous hormones. inhibition of enzymes involved in oestrogen biosynthesis and metabolism to modulate concentrations of endogenous oestrogens. However, much of the evidence for these effects comes from in vitro studies and require much higher concentrations of phytoestrogens than are likely to be achieved in vivo via dietary exposure. The studies carried out in humans have reported disparate effects. Therefore, at present it is not clear what suchinteractions contribute towards oestrogenic effects observed in vivo . The pregnane X receptor (PXR) may monitor steroid and xenobiotic concentrations and upregulate genes that metabolise such compounds. Since PXR is expressed mainly in the gut and liver, exposureto dietary phytoestrogens could result in the increased metabolism of endogenous oestrogens. In vitro experiments have shown that phytoestrogens can inhibit thyroid peroxidase, an enzyme involved in synthesis of thyroid hormones. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that genistein interacts with topoisomerase II and protein kinases which are enzymes involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation. However, theconcentrations of phytoestrogens required to inhibit these enzymes are higher than concentrations ofphytoestrogens likely to be achieved in vivo following dietary exposure. No studies have directly demonstrated such effects in vivo . There are limited data on the genotoxic potential of phytoestrogens. Studies have indicated that coumestrol and genistein may be genotoxic at concentrations very much higher than would beachieved in vivo from dietary exposure to phytoestrogens. The single study that has investigated the in vivo mutagenicity of isoflavones suggests that genistein at dietary levels is not mutagenic in vivo .Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 144 Data suggests that phytoestrogens may possess antioxidant properties but at much higher concentrations than would be expected to be achieved in vivo following dietary exposure. Human studies suggest that dietary soy may have antioxidant effects such as inhibition of LDL oxidation.However, these effects may not be attributable to the phytoestrogen content of soy.

As outlined in Chapters 6 and 7, phytoestrogens may elicit oestrogenic effects either bydirect interaction with oestrogen or indirectly by modulation of endogenous oestrogen levels.Oestrogenic potency is expressed as the ratio of the activity of a test compound relative to that ofoestradiol, the major human oestrogen in the same assay. This comparison offers a perspective on thepotential biological effects of phytoestrogens. In general, most phytoestrogens are relatively weakoestrogens, requiring much higher concentrations than oestradiol to produce an equivalent biologicalresponse. 8.2 A variety of experimental methods are used to assess the oestrogenicity of phytoestrogens, and the estimate of oestrogenic potency can vary significantly between methods. This chapter reviews the rangeof in vitro and in vivo experimental methods in use. 8.3 In general, in vivo assays provide a more holistic view of oestrogenic activity. These assays incorporate many different biological processes, including absorption and metabolism, which influence oestrogenicactivity. Many of the in vitro methods are a simple measurement of direct interaction with the oestrogen receptor and are not necessarily predictive of oestrogenic activity in vivo. Oestrogen receptor binding assays 8.4 Oestrogen receptor binding assays provide a quantitative indication of the oestrogenic activity of a phytoestrogen relative to that of oestradiol at the receptor level. They are conducted in vitro and examine the binding affinity of phytoestrogens to oestrogen receptors, which is termed the relativebinding affinity (RBA). RBAs are usually expressed as the concentration of a compound required to inhibitoestradiol binding by 50% or IC 50(Blair et al , 2000) (see Figure 8.1). Thus, RBAs provide a simple measurement of the affinity of a compound to the receptor but do not indicate whether a compoundwill behave as an agonist, antagonist or partial agonist (see paragraphs 6.20-6.24).8. Estimation of phytoestrogen oestrogenic potencyCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 154Figure 8.1 Determination of IC50from a competitive ligand-binding assay. The binding of oestradiol to oestrogen receptors is measured in the presence of increasing concentrationsof a phytoestrogen. The IC 50value for a phytoestrogen is the concentration of compound required to inhibit oestradiol binding by 50%. 8.5 Many studies have investigated the binding affinity of isoflavones to oestrogen receptors. However, there is a paucity of data for lignans. The RBA of the same phytoestrogen may differ markedly between studies.The range of RBAs reported for phytoestrogens are shown in Table 8.1. Table 8.1 Ranges of relative binding affinities (RBA) for phytoestrogens to oestrogen receptors. RBAs are relative to oestradiol, which has been assigned an arbitrary binding affinity of 1. Ranges of RBA arerepresented as individual studies report different values of binding affinity using this assay method. aData from Breithofer et al (1998; Collins et et (1997; Graumann et al (1998); Hunter et al (1999); (1998); Kuiper Petit et (1997); Sathyamoorthy & Stahl et al (1998); Wang et al (1995); Zava & Duwe (1997); 0% oestradiol bound1558.6 It is probable that experimental protocols vary between laboratories, and this may contribute to inter- laboratory differences in the results. Additionally, variations in the oestrogen receptor subtype andvariants used in the assays may account for the range of values obtained for a single phytoestrogen. Asdescribed in 6.22-6.23, phytoestrogens can bind preferentially to the /H9252subtype. There is a number of variants of oestrogen receptors and phytoestrogens that can also bind (with different affinities) to these receptor variants. For example, binding studies to ER /H9252variants have demonstrated that coumestrol and genistein bind to ER /H92522 with a weaker affinity than to ER /H92521 (see Table 8.2; Petersen et al , 1998). Table 8.2 Binding affinities of oestradiol, coumestrol and genistein to the /H92521 and /H92522 variants of the oestrogen receptor. Data taken from Petersen et al (1998). 8.7 When studies are taken together, a rank order of RBA can be derived for phytoestrogens Sathyamoorthy & Wang, et al , al 1999b). 8.8 Metabolism of phytoestrogens can result in structural changes for example through glucuronidation or sulfation of hydroxyl groups. These changes can significantly hinder the compound binding to thereceptor which lowers the affinity of the metabolite relative to the parent compound (Breinholt &Larsen, 1998; Cheek et al, 1998). For example, the glucuronides of genistein and daidzein bind with lower affinity to the oestrogen receptors when compared with their unconjugated forms (Zhang et al , 1999a; 1999b). Cell proliferation assays 8.9 Oestrogen dependent cell proliferation is used as a screening assay for oestrogenic activity. Phytoestrogens have been shown to both stimulate and inhibit cell proliferation in oestrogen dependentcell lines. These effects appear to be concentration dependent, as phytoestrogens stimulateproliferation in the 0.1-10 /H9262M concentration range but inhibit proliferation at higher concentrations (/H1102210 /H9262M). It has been suggested that the proliferative effects of phytoestrogens may reflect direct receptor mediated responses, whereas the inhibitory effect are not directly mediated via the oestrogenreceptors. This proposal is supported by evidence that phytoestrogens do not stimulate proliferation ofCompound ER /H92521 binding Genistein 0.26 41.5Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 156ER-negative cells, but are still inhibitory to their growth at high concentrations (Pagliacci et al , 1994; Wang et al , 1996; 1999). 8.10 The potency of many phytoestrogens has been evaluated using these assays and a range of parameters is used to estimate oestrogenicity (see Table 8.3). However, not all of these parameters are measured ineach study which makes both inter-study comparisons and ranking of oestrogenic potency difficult(Breinholt & Larsen, Hsu 1997; Zava & Duwe, 1997). Table 8.3 Parameters used to evaluate oestrogenic activity in cell proliferation assays. 8.11 On the basis of C maxdata, coumestrol, genistein and enterolactone are estimated as three orders of magnitude less potent than oestradiol. Other phytoestrogens are estimated as at least another order ofmagnitude less potent (Mousavi & Adlercreutz (1992); Wang & Kurzer (1997); Zava & Duwe (1997)). 8.12 The EC 50 is probably the most useful parameter when making intra- and inter-study comparisons, although is difficult to compare the values for agonists and partial agonists (see paragraph 6.20-6.24).Very few studies use the EC 50parameter with the exception of reports by Breinholt & Larsen (1998) and Kitaoka et al (1998). In the study carried out by Breinholt and Larsen (1998), 23 potential phytoestrogens were tested in a breast cell proliferation assay. These data indicate that all the phytoestrogens were atleast 3-4 orders of magnitude less potent than oestradiol, with isoflavones having the highest potency.No single phytoestrogen elicited a maximal response greater than 80% that of oestradiol. A study byHunter et al (1999) evaluated oestrogenic potency of phytoestrogens based on EC 25 rather than EC50 data. In this study, EC25values of 1 and 0.1 nM were estimated for coumestrol and genistein, respectively, whereas oestradiol was 1 pM. Kitaoka et al (1998) demonstrated that 8-prenylnaringenin was approximately 3 orders of magnitude less potent than oestradiol.Parameter What is measured ECminLowest concentration of compound which promotes cell proliferation. CmaxConcentration of compound that promotes maximal cell proliferation. EC50Concentration that gives 50% of the maximum response. MaxIConcentration of compound inducing maximal expression level of an oestrogen responsive gene. Not a measure of cell proliferation per se but can be used as supporting evidence of oestrogenic activity.157Recombinant mammalian and yeast cell-based transcription assays 8.13 The oestrogenic potency of phytoestrogens has been assessed using mammalian cells engineered to express a reporter gene under the control of an oestrogen response element (ERE). In these assays, thereporter gene product is usually an enzyme and is measured either indirectly (by measurement ofenzymatic activity of the reporter gene product), or directly by quantification of the transcript or protein(Mayr et al, 1992; Sathyamoorthy & Wang, 1997; Zava & Duwe, 1997). Similar systems have been developed in yeast, which have been engineered to express mammalian forms of oestrogen receptors (Coldham et al, 1997). 8.14 Most of these studies have assessed the oestrogenicity of phytoestrogens by comparison with oestradiol. However, the data are not always amenable to inter-study comparison as different testsystems are employed or investigators have not studied the same compounds. The range of potenciesof various phytoestrogens reported from reporter gene assays is shown in Table 8.4. The wide range ofvalues obtained with different cell types and reporter assays may be due to contrasting kinetics incellular metabolism, uptake and membrane transport (Nagel et al , 1998; 1999). For example, yeast cells have the ability to transport specific steroid compounds out of the cell (Kralli et al, 1995). Consequently, differences in the efflux of test compounds will affect the estimation of oestrogenic potency. The designof the recombinant system will also determine the sensitivity of the system. Ashby et al (1999) demonstrated that the source of ERE used in a cell-based assay can influence the extent of oestrogenicactivity. Table 8.4 Range of oestrogenic potencies obtained for phytoestrogens determined by cell-based transcription assays.Potencies are relative to oestradiol, which has been assigned an arbitrary binding affinity of 1. Ranges ofpotency are represented as individual studies report different values using this type of assay. aData from Arnold et al (1996); Ashby et al Baker et al (1998); Breithofer et al (1997); Gaido et al (1997); Hopert et al (1998); Hunter et al (1999); Petit et al (1997); Sathyamoorthy & Wang (1997); Willard 1 - 0.0045Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 1588.15 Relative potencies can be determined using EC50values relative to the EC50for oestradiol. However, many compounds are partial agonists and therefore, do not give as great a response as oestradiol nomatter what concentration of test compound is used. Thus, comparisons of EC 50values, derived from cell-based transcription assays may not be accurately made (Kuiper et al , 1998). 8.16 Coumestrol is often shown to be the most potent phytoestrogen in these test systems (100-1000-fold less potent than et al, Ashby et al, 1999; Baker et al, Petit et al Sathyamoorthy Willard & Frawley, 1998; & Duwe, 1997). 8.17 The potencies of individual phytoestrogens have been assessed in a yeast cell system expressing a human ER /H9251and an ERE reporter gene, relative Sauer, 8.18 Arnold et al (1996) showed that the oestrogenic activities of both oestradiol and coumestrol were reduced by 75% in a reporter gene assay when physiological levels of serum, SHBG or /H9251-fetoprotein were included. These proteins lowered the concentrations of the free forms of these compounds. However,isoflavones bind to SHBG with a 1000-5000-fold lower affinity than oestradiol (Nagel et al , 1998; 1999). Thus, in the presence of serum proteins, the potencies of phytoestrogens relative to oestradiol may beexpected to increase when compared to potencies evaluated under serum-free conditions. Potency of phytoestrogen mixtures 8.19 Data on the oestrogenic potency of mixtures of phytoestrogens are limited. Willard & Frawley (1998) demonstrated that co-treatment with equimolar concentrations of genistein, daidzein, formononetinand equol additive oestrogenic response in reporter gene assay than that observed for anyindividual phytoestrogen. However, Collins et al (1997) demonstrated that biochanin A and flavone inhibited the activity of oestradiol in a reporter gene assay, which is predictable for these weakpartial agonists. Interpretation of in vitro potency data 8.20 An estimation of oestrogenic potency, which is derived from a receptor binding assay provides an indication of whether a compound can bind to an oestrogen receptor and the strength of that binding.However, it reveals little about the ability of the compound to activate the receptor. Cell-based assayswhich measure proliferative responses or reporter gene expression indicate whether a compound canact as an oestrogen receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist. These assays can provide anapproximate assessment of biological activity and can also be used to provide a rank order of potency.1598.21 Receptor binding or cell-based assays are useful tools for screening foods or plants in order to identify novel phytoestrogens. However, in vitro assay systems have a number of limitations in terms of predicting biological activity. They do not reflect the specific tissue distributions of phytoestrogens. In addition, these assays do not incorporate any measure of the bioavailability, metabolism or the extent of binding to serum proteins, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of phytoestrogens. All of these factors can modify the in vivo biological activity of phytoestrogens. Thus, in vitro systems will fail, by and large, to be predictive of the true potency of phytoestrogens in vivo , but can indicate their relative potential. In vivo assessment of oestrogenic effects 8.22 The in vivo oestrogenic activity of phytoestrogens has been assessed in a number of experimental models (reviewed in Rudel, 1997). In contrast to in vitro methods, in vivo assays take account of factors such as bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, distribution and interactions with binding andtransport proteins. Therefore, in vivo assays offer a more holistic way to assess the oestrogenicity of a compound. In addition, whereas most in vitro assays assess phytoestrogen interactions with individual oestrogen receptors, in vivo assays measure the composite response from both direct and indirect mechanisms of phytoestrogen action (outlined in Chapters 6 and 7). 8.23 A range of different end points can be used as indicators of oestrogenic activity (see Table 8.5). The oestrogenic responses induced in an in vivo model are dependent on a number of experimental factors outlined below. Species 8.24 The majority of research into the oestrogenic properties of phytoestrogens has been carried out in rodents. Other species such as rabbits and primates have been used, but to a much lesser extent. Inter-species differences in the ADME of phytoestrogens have a strong influence on the ultimate oestrogeniceffect. Additionally, inter-species differences in fetal, neonatal and pubertal development, endogenousoestrogen concentrations as well as endocrine physiology and function will also determine themagnitude and type of biological response following phytoestrogen exposure (Jobling, 1998). Inter-straindifferences in susceptibility to oestrogenic effects have been reported in mice (Spearow et al, 1999; 2001). Therefore, it is important that the influence of species and strain differences are recognised and taken into account when extrapolating experimental findings to humans. Route of administration 8.25 The route of administration has a major influence on the oestrogenic potency of phytoestrogens. In terms of human exposure to phytoestrogens, oral administration is the most relevant. However, manystudies have used intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration, which allows compounds to enter thesystemic circulation, by-passing metabolism in the gut and/ or liver. Thus, if phytoestrogens areadministered by these routes, a more potent oestrogenic response is induced as much of thedeactivating effect of metabolism on phytoestrogens has been by-passed. Although not relevant todietary exposures, use of these routes of administration establishes whether a compound can inprinciple produce oestrogenic effects and helps identify target tissues.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 160Effect of timing and duration of exposure 8.26 The sensitivity of the endocrine system to the effects of phytoestrogens is dependent upon the developmental stage and the age when exposure occurs i.e. in utero , perinatal, neonatal, pre-pubertal or adult exposure. Thus, there is an age-related sensitivity to oestrogens and the timing of exposure is acritical determinant of effect. Multiple doses of a compound can exert greater and possibly longer-termoestrogenic effects than a single exposure. The effect of multiple exposures and their timing will bediscussed in detail in Chapter 9. Table 8.5 Endpoints used to assess the oestrogenic activity of phytoestrogens in vivo . Most methods use rodents as the test model and effects are assessed by comparison with untreatedanimals. End point Oestrogenic response assessed Example of study reporting oestrogenic effects to phytoestrogens Female Development of Increase in weight of oestrogen-sensitive tissue e.g. Ashby et al (2000); Milligan et al (1998) oestrogen sensitive uterine growth (uterotrophic assay), uterine tissues vascular permeability.

Strauss et al (1998) tissue161Effect of diet 8.27 Standard rodent diets can be supplemented with ingredients such as soybeans, flax, wheat, barley, corn, alfalfa and oats, which contain phytoestrogens (Thigpen e t al, (1999a and 1999b). Thigpen et al (1999a) analysed twelve standard animal diets and reported that daidzein and genistein were present in ten outof the twelve diets. The concentrations of daidzein and genistein in these diets ranged from 53-277mg/kg and 69-491 mg/kg, respectively. Odum et al (2001) showed that such rodent diets were oestrogenic when compared with phytoestrogen-free diets. rodent diets canprovide a significant source of phytoestrogens and this background exposure may reduce the sensitivityof animals to phytoestrogens. Thus, phytoestrogen-free diets are the diets choice when theoestrogenicity of phytoestrogens in vivo . 8.28 The oestrogenic effects of phytoestrogens in animal models and how they are extrapolated to and interpreted in the context of human exposures is discussed in Chapter 9. Assessment of oestrogenic potency (the uterotrophic assay) 8.29 As discussed in the previous section a wide range of biological end points has been used to assess oestrogenic activity in vivo . Most methods involve analysis of female reproductive tissue development and function. However, other than the uterotrophic assay, few endpoints are suitable for potency. 8.30 The rodent uterotrophic assay measures uterine growth in animals treated with a test compound compared with controls treated with an oestrogen such as oestradiol or diethylstilboestrol (DES). Thepotency value is expressed as the dose of phytoestrogen required to produce an equivalent change inuterine weight (Bickoff, 1962). 8.31 The uterotrophic assay is performed in immature or ovariectomised animals. Such animals have lower concentrations of endogenous oestrogens which increases the sensitivity of the assay to exogenousoestrogens. Inter-species differences in the uterotrophic response to genistein have been reported aswell as differences in sensitivity to route of exposure. Also, considerable inter-laboratory variations arereported for specific compounds (Whitten & Patisaul, 2001). This makes inter-study comparisons difficultand the results must be placed in the context of the experimental methodology. For example, potencyvalues of coumestrol from uterotrophic assays ranged from 100-2500 times 1995; Whitten et al , 1992). 8.32 The absence of any standardised protocol for the uterotrophic assay has been recognised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and an international programme isin progress to validate the rodent uterotrophic assay to allow compounds that are suspected agonistsand antagonists of oestrogen to be identified (Kanno et al , 2001). The programme aims to validate the 3 day uterotrophic assay in immature intact and adult ovariectomised rat models. Compounds areadministered by oral gavage or subcutaneous injection and dose-response relationships derived.Although the uterotrophic response is considered an oestrogenic effect it has yet to be confirmed as anadverse health effect.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 1628.33 The oestrogenic response is dependent on the dose administered, and generally a dose-dependent response is produced. However, there are exceptions to this. The uterine response can be divided intotwo phases: an early phase, which occurs /H110112-4 hours after the initial exposure. This phase is characterised by increased vascular permeability, oedema and eosinophilia in the uterus. The secondphase response includes changes in cell division, differentiation and uterine growth. The first phase isdependent on the oestrogenic potency of the compound whereas, the second phase is dependent onboth the oestrogenic potency and the dosing schedule. Thus, a single administration of a compound,which is a weak oestrogen, can induce the first phase, but thereafter, the response declines and may notinduce second phase uterine activity. Whereas, a potent oestrogen may induce phase one and twouterine activity after a single administration. Large or repeated doses of a weak oestrogen may alsoinduce the second phase uterine activity shown by strong oestrogens. For example, subcutaneousadministration of either oestradiol or oestriol (a weaker oestrogen) results in uterine activity within a fewhours. However, 24 hours after administration, oestriol is unable to mimic the phase two effects ofoestradiol. If oestriol is administered repeatedly it can produce a range of oestrogenic responses similarto oestradiol (Milligan et al , 1998). 8.34 Although many studies have demonstrated the uterotrophic activity of phytoestrogens, there have been very few systematic and large-scale assessments of their relative oestrogenic potency. Bickoff (1962)defined the oestrogenic potency of phytoestrogens in an immature mouse model as the dose requiredto induce the development of a uterus weighing at least 25 mg. The potency of several phytoestrogenswas assessed in this early assay and coumestrol was found to be the most potent phytoestrogen,although it was 200 and 3000-fold less potent than oestrone and diethylstilboestrol, respectively.Genistein, daidzein, biochanin A and formononetin were found to be 30-100 fold less active thancoumestrol. Song et al , (1999) demonstrated that glycitein and genistein were 33,000, and 100,000-fold less potent than DES in a mouse uterotrophic assay. 8-Prenylnaringenin was 3000-fold less potent (Miyamoto et al , 1998). The relative oestrogenic potency of the lignans has not been assessed using this assay. 8.35 There are male equivalents to the uterotrophic assay which detect androgenic activity. The castrated male rat assay, described by Hershberger et al (1953), has been used to detect androgenic and anti- androgenic chemicals. However, this assay is limited by the need for surgical castration. Severalalternative approaches have been proposed including an assay which uses peri-pubertal male rats (PND22-35) and monitors changes in testes, epididymides, seminal vesicle and prostate weights (Ashby &Lefevre, 2000). have not been tested in these assays. Phytoestrogen potency determined by in vitro and in vivo methods 8.36 The methods currently used to measure the oestrogenic potency of phytoestrogens are summarised in table 8.6 8.37 Constructing a single rank order of oestrogenic potency of phytoestrogens from combined in vitro and in vivo data is difficult. Different compounds have been tested and no single compound has been tested in all test models. There is significant variation in the potency of phytoestrogens, which differ according163to the test model, methodology and end-point(s) employed. Figure 8.3 demonstrates the range of potencies reported in the literature. 8.38 The oestrogenic potency measured in these assays may provide an indication of the biological potency of a phytoestrogen. For many compounds in vitro activity is correlated with oestrogenicity in vivo . However, this is not consistently the case, for example, 8-prenylnarigenin is relatively potent in in vitro assays but relatively inactive in vivo (Coldham & Sauer, 2001). Conversely glycitein is a relatively weak oestrogen in in vitro assays but a relatively potent oestrogen in vivo (Song et al, 1999). True comparisons of the oestrogenic potencies of phytoestrogens requires standardisation of the test methods.Furthermore, assessments of potency by any one method are likely to be inadequate and fullcharacterisation of a phytoestrogen may require a battery of tests, including both in vitro and in vivo methods and yet still yield results that have different relevance for effects in humans.

Receptor binding assays measure the simple interaction of phytoestrogens with oestrogen receptors but do not provide an indication of receptor activation. Relative binding affinities derived from receptor binding assays are dependent on the subtype and variant of the receptor used (see chapter 6). Potency values from in vitro assays are dependent on the test system e.g. cell line and reporter construct used. In vivo assays provide a more holistic assessment of oestrogenic potency. These assays incorporate oestrogenic modulation of endogenous oestrogen concentrationsas well as direct interactions with oestrogen receptors. In addition, they include biological processsuch as absorption, distribution metabolism and excretion, and plasma protein binding that influenceoestrogenic activity. Potency values from the uterotrophic assay are dependent on a number of experimental parameters such as: animal species and strain, route of administration, hormonal status, stage of development anddiet. As potency values are dependent on the assay used, and vary considerably, the relative absolute oestrogenic potency of phytoestrogens is difficult to determine. However, taking the results of bothin vitro and in vivo studies of phytoestrogen potency together, a rank are much lower than those of theparent phytoestrogens.

Ewes feeding on Australian cloverdeveloped abnormal plasma concentrations of endogenous hormones with subsequent loss of fertility(Bennett et al Moersch et al , syndrome was termed \"Clover Disease\" . 9.2 Subsequent investigations showed that when pregnant ewes were fed on yarloop clover, plasma progesterone and oestrogen concentrations were lowered. This resulted in a substantial reduction (27%)of the mated ewes achieving successful conception, compared with ewes (95%) fed on grass. Similar, butmore extreme, effects on fertility were observed in ewes administered large quantities of oestradiol(300 mg) for periods of up to 26 months (Adams & Sanders, 1988). 9.3 These effects on fertility by a known oestrogen led to the hypothesis that oestrogenic compounds in the clover were responsible for the adverse effects on fertility. Compounds of similar structure tooestradiol were identified in several types of clover: 1976). It is thought that sheep may be particularly susceptible to the oestrogenic effects of these phytoestrogens due to the efficient conversion offormononetin to the more oestrogenic compound, equol and the limited deactivation of the potentoestrogen, coumestrol by metabolism (Shutt, 1976). Improved farming practices have since preventedfurther incidences of \"Clover Disease\" (Little, 1996). 9.4 Additional evidence that dietary exposure to oestrogenic compounds could adversely affect reproduction in mammals was shown in research on captive female cheetahs. High concentrations ofgenistein and daidzein in commercial feed, together with the limited ability of this species to deactivatethese compounds metabolically, resulted in veno-occlusive disease and reproductive failure (Setchellet al, 1987). Fertility problems in the females of mammalian species such as the cow, sheep, rabbit, guinea pig and mouse have also been reported (Adams, 1995; Batterham et al Humfrey, 1998; Kallela et al, 1984). These effects have raised concerns that dietary phytoestrogens may have similar effects on development and fertility in other species including the human. 9.5 It is established that exposure to potent oestrogens in utero can have long-term adverse effects on human development and fertility in males and, more severely, in female offspring. The syntheticoestrogen, diethylstilboestrol (DES) of comparable potency to oestradiol, initially developed as a drugto prevent miscarriage, was used widely from the 1940s. The subsequent discovery that in utero exposure to DES induced abnormal development of the reproductive system during puberty in male and female9. Effects of phytoestrogens on fertility and developmentCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 174offspring and vaginal adenocarcinoma resulted in a ban by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1971 (Giusti et al , 1995; Swan, 2000). These findings have raised concerns that exposure to phytoestrogens in utero may also give rise to similar adverse effects later in life. 9.6 This chapter outlines the role of hormones in human sexual development and reproductive function and reviews the experimental evidence for effects of phytoestrogens on sexual development andreproductive function. Human data are extremely limited and the majority of information is derived fromexperimental studies in laboratory animals, some of which may not be relevant to the human. Thepublished research is reviewed and the health implications are discussed in the context of both theexperimental and human data. Role of hormones in human sexual differentiation 9.7 A fetus is either genetically male or female (Graves, 2001). However, all mammalian fetuses will automatically develop into phenotypic females unless male hormones (androgens) are produced. Thesehormones, primarily testosterone, change the phenotype of the fetus from female to male and playcritical roles in masculinisation. This requirement for androgens illustrates the vulnerability of the malefetus to factors that can affect the production/ action of androgens during this short, critical time periodof fetal development. Male development 9.8 The precise role that oestrogens play in male reproductive development is unclear, but in general, oestrogens tend to have 'demasculinising' or anti-androgenic effects. In fetal and neonatal life, thisprobably results from suppression of testosterone production (Haavisto et al, 2001; Williams et al, 2001a), or loss of androgen receptors (McKinnell et al, 2001). Oestrogens are synthesised from androgens viathe action of a single enzyme (aromatase), and there is a close relationship between the actions of these twohormones (see Figure 9.1). 9.9 In terms of steroid hormone production, the ovary is quiescent and remains so until puberty over a decade later. Hormones produced by the fetal testes, particularly androgens, are essential formasculinisation of the male fetus during the first trimester of human pregnancy. Furthermore, in the first12 months postnatally, the male infant produces androgens, in amounts equivalent to those of an adultman. This has been termed the 'neonatal testosterone surge' but, as yet, the functional purpose of thishormonal surge is unclear (Mann & Fraser, 1996). Suppression of the neonatal surge in primates results inlong-term effects such as altered thymus weight and an increase in the number of Leydig cells in thetestes (Mann et al, 1998). It can also retard the pubertal rise in testosterone levels and elongation of the penis, though these both eventually normalise (Brown et al , 1999). However, it is reported that suppression of the neonatal testosterone surge has little or no effect on sexual behaviour and fertility(Lunn et al , 1997).175Figure 9.1 The conversion of androgens to oestrogens mediated by aromatase. 9.10 Because oestrogens can exert demasculinising effects, the concern that dietary phytoestrogens might affect the sexual differentiation and development process is understandable. Also as infants are breast-or bottle-fed throughout the neonatal period, exposure to chemical compounds in milk is of particularsignificance at this stage of life. In this regard, the high phytoestrogen content of soy-based milk formulais a cause of concern. Effects of alterations of hormone levels during fetal/neonatal life 9.11 Interference with, or inadequate production of, androgens and disruption of the balance between androgen and oestrogen levels will impact on the degree of masculinisation of the male fetus (Williamset al , 2001a). The more severe the interference, the more severe the manifestation, with complete lack of masculinisation (i.e. genotypic male with female genitalia) representing the most extremeconsequence, whereas hypospadias and cryptorchidism represent progressively milder consequences.Such conditions are usually recognised at birth. However, when less extreme interference of androgenaction occurs, or there is exposure to relatively low levels of oestrogens, no obvious consequences maybe evident at birth and they may only manifest in adulthood. 9.12 These manifestations may be separated from the 'exposure event' by several decades, which makes it extremely difficult to establish causal relationships. Nevertheless, there are examples of such a causallink. For instance, the occurrence of testicular germ cell cancer in young adult men probably results fromthe development of aberrant germ cells in the testes in fetal life (Rajpert-De Meyts et al, 1998). Another example relates to sperm production and fertility in adulthood. Considering that sperm are notproduced until late puberty, it may seem surprising that the number and/ or quality can be Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 176events occurring in the fetal or neonatal testis. However, the germ cells (from which sperm are produced) and the Sertoli cells (which control and organise the process of sperm production) are both present inthe testis from early in pregnancy. The Sertoli cells proliferate during fetal life and especially in neonatallife, the latter coinciding with the neonatal testosterone surge and further Sertoli cell proliferationoccurs at some time close to puberty (Sharpe et al , 1999). 9.13 The increase in Sertoli cell numbers during testicular development is very important in terms of male fertility. Each Sertoli cell supports a fixed number of germ cells, therefore in normal individuals thereis a linear relationship between the number of Sertoli cells and sperm production (Johnson et al , 1984), and the latter is the main determinant of sperm counts in men. However, other factors such asejaculatory frequency, infections/ disease may also affect sperm counts in the ejaculate. The increasein Sertoli cell number that occurs during fetal and neonatal life may therefore be an importantdeterminant of sperm counts in adult men. As proliferation of Sertoli cells at these times is partlydependent on stimulation by hormones secreted from the pituitary gland, any interference with thishormonal stimulation may result in lower Sertoli cell numbers. This has been shown to be the case inexperimental studies in marmoset monkeys, in which Sertoli cell proliferation occurs at similar timeperiods as in the human (Sharpe et al , 2000). However, this same study also showed that even when Sertoli cell number was reduced by /H1101130% by the end of the neonatal period, compensation for reduced Sertoli cell number was able to occur after the neonatal period, such that normal numbers were presentby adulthood. Similar compensation may therefore occur in the human if subnormal numbers of Sertolicells are present neonatally. It is also known that other hormones, such as thyroid hormone and growthhormone, can affect Sertoli cell proliferation. Therefore, exposure to any factor that alters productionof these hormones may affect the reproductive system viatheir effects on Sertoli cells. 9.14 In rats, Sertoli cell proliferation continues until postnatal day (PND) 15 and after this time no further proliferation occurs. Thus, by measuring Sertoli cell proliferation, it is possible to determine the effectof placental or lactational chemical exposure during the post-natal period or the entire length of Sertolicell development (Sharpe et al , 1999). However, in humans and other primates, Sertoli cell proliferation can still occur after the post-natal period, probably up to just prior to puberty (Sharpe et al , 2000). 9.15 Normal male development involves major, dynamic changes to the testes and reproductive system in fetal and neonatal life. Together, these changes ensure that in adulthood, two decades later, a fullyfunctional reproductive system is capable of producing very large numbers of sperm each day to ensurefertility. All of the changes are hormone-mediated to a greater or lesser degree. Furthermore, thehormones produced to 'shape' the reproductive system also have 'masculinising' effects throughout thebody, including the shaping of male sexual behaviour and drive, and again these effects probably occurmainly in early fetal life in the human.177Female development 9.16 In contrast, the development of the female reproductive system is relatively passive. It does not depend on hormonal stimulation and does not require hormonal activity in the neonatal period as in the male.These fundamental differences mean that males are inherently more susceptible than females todisruption of hormone-dependent sexual differentiation. However, there is still a risk that inappropriateexposure of the developing female fetus to exogenous oestrogens might induce permanent changes tothe brain or reproductive system, as illustrated in some offspring of women treated with DES duringpregnancy. Hormones and 'endocrine disruption': critical windows of vulnerability 9.17 In fetal and neonatal life, when the reproductive system is developing, androgenic and oestrogenic hormones can exert 'organisational' effects that permanently shape the reproductive system and itsfunction. In contrast, during puberty and adulthood the same hormones exert 'activational' and'functional' effects, respectively, on a 'pre-formed' reproductive system. Inappropriate hormonalexposures during either of these periods, especially in adulthood, are less likely to cause permanentchanges as most of the organisational changes have already taken place. The primary reason for this agerelated difference is that hormonal systems are homeostatic in adult males and females (see Figures 9.2and 9.3). In other words, they are designed to compensate if hormone levels rise or fall above a particularlevel (threshold) in order that a constant or appropriate level of hormone is maintained. However, inearly life the set point for this threshold is being established and therefore, the hormonal systems arenot yet under homeostatic control. 9.18 Consequently, all endocrine systems are balanced in adulthood, but not in early life, by a negative feedback loop in which the hormone being stimulated reaches a set concentration and thenautomatically inhibits its own production. In the case of androgens in the male, the 'stimulator' is lutenising hormone (LH; see Figure. 9.2) while for oestrogen in the female the 'stimulator' is both follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH, depending on the stage of follicle development (see Figure 9.3). 9.19 Therefore, if an adult woman is exposed to an exogenous oestrogen such as a phytoestrogen, the level of endogenous oestrogen production will normally be lowered to ensure relatively constant'oestrogen' levels. In contrast, exposure of a fetus or neonate to phytoestrogens has the potential toinduce permanent effects because of disruption of the organisational changes occurring in the fetus orneonate at this time. The importance of exposure levels 9.20 The purpose of the negative feedback system illustrated in Figures 9.2 and 9.3 is to ensure that hormone levels are maintained within a range that guarantees normal function. Therefore, even if humans areexposed during adulthood to oestrogenic compounds (phytoestrogens), it does not necessarily followthat the exposure will have a biological consequence. The exposure must be of sufficient durationCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 178and/ or magnitude that it activates the homeostatic systems (see Figures 9.2 and 9.3). In theory, the hormonal systems should re-adjust. However, potential health consequences are conceivable if exposureto the phytoestrogen is of such magnitude and/ or duration that it 'swamps' the system or results in 'side-effects' because of the homeostatic adjustments. For example, suppression of LH by additional negativefeedback results in failure of ovulation. 9.21 This applies also to exposures during fetal and/ or neonatal life, but with two important differences. First, adjustments to the levels of fetal and/ or neonatal hormones to compensate for the exposure toexogenous hormones cannot be made and therefore, the exposure may lead to target-organ effects.Secondly, it is during this period that the threshold level for the regulatory feedback systems isestablished. Inappropriate exposure during this critical period may permanently alter sensitivity tohormonal signals such that the endocrine system may never function properly. For example,inappropriate exposure of newborn female rodents to oestrogens alters the 'setting up' of theirhypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian hormonal axis (see Figure 9.3), such that in adulthood they are unable toexhibit normal ovarian cycles 11. Effects of phytoestrogens on non-reproductive tissues 9.22 The previous sections have specifically outlined the development of the reproductive system. However, it is clear from the distribution of oestrogen receptors (see Chapter 6), that oestrogens (and androgens)act on many different tissues and cells in the body. These range from the brain, to bone, fat, immunesystem and cardiovascular system (Sharpe, 1998). Recent studies of transgenic mice in which theoestrogen receptors or the aromatase enzyme have been inactivated, show changes in fat cells/fataccumulation, lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, vascular repair and bone mineralisation among otherprocesses (Couse & Korach, 1999, see chapter 6). It is not yet clear which of these changes may bereversible, but at least in aromatase deficient mice and humans, many of the effects are reversiblefollowing restoration of normal oestrogen activity (Grumbach & Auchus, 1999). 9.23 A number of mammalian developmental stages are sensitive to disruption by exogenous oestrogens and androgens. Therefore, the timing of exposure is a major determinant on the subsequent effects ondevelopment. There are differences in the timing and sequence of specific developmental eventsbetween humans and rodents (see Figures 9.4 and 9.5). For example, sexual differentiation occurs fromweeks 5-19 of pregnancy in humans, but in rodents occurs during a relatively short period fromgestational days 12-20, with some aspects being completed during the neonatal period. Furthermore,sexual differentiation in the brain (which is dependent on the action of androgens and oestrogens)occurs in utero in humans, but during the neonatal period in rodents (Becu-Villalobos et al , 1997). Thus, administration of a phytoestrogen at a particular stage of rodent development may not be equivalent tothe same period in humans. In addition, there are differences in the time span of sexual maturationbetween species. In comparison with humans and other primate neonates, newborn rodents arerelatively underdeveloped and their development may be more sensitive than primates and humans tothe action of phytoestrogens during the neonatal period. 11It has been suggested that exposures during the fetal or neonatal period, which alter the programming of hormonal homeostasis may not necessarily result in adverse health effects later in life (for example see Desai & Hales (1997)).179Figure 9.2 Hormonal regulation of the male reproductive system. In the male, gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) secreted from the hypothalamus oestradiol, which to acts inhibin, are involved in regulating GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus. Negative Feedback Feedback Positive StimulationCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 180Figure 9.3 Hormonal regulation of the female reproductive system. In the female, gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) secreted from the hypothalamus the pituitary. FSH and LHare secreted at different rates throughout the menstrual cycle. At the beginning of the cycle (follicularphase), FSH promotes the development of follicles, one of which develops more rapidly into a graffianfollicle (GF) (the other follicles degenerate). The GF secretes and inhibin. At mid-cycle LH causes the GF to rupture resulting in ovulation and formation of the corpus luteum (CL). The CLsecretes progesterone (the luteal phase of the cycle). Oestradiol, inhibin and progesterone regulate GnRHsecretion from the hypothalamus. At the end of the cycle progesterone secretion stops, leading tomenstruation. The menstrual cycle continues, unless interrupted by pregnancy, until menopause. GnRH neurons Positive StimulationNegative Feedback (but positive development) is a critical period during development when the fetus is susceptible to toxic agents (Pryor et al , 2000). In humans, this process occurs between weeks 3-8 of gestation, but between days 7-17 of gestation in the rat (Dencker & Eriksson, 1998). A further sensitive period in thedevelopment of many mammals occurs during the rapid acceleration of brain growth. In humans, thiscorresponds to the third trimester of pregnancy and continues throughout the first years of life, whereasin rodents this corresponds to the first 3-4 weeks of postnatal life (Dencker & Eriksson, 1998). Spermatogenesis 9.25 Spermatogenesis (the production of spermatozoa from germ cells) is similar in rodents, primates and humans and can be disrupted by chemicals that interact directly with the testis or by chemicals thatmodulate plasma gonadotrophin or sex hormone concentrations. Effects on spermatogenesis can beevaluated by measuring sperm number, motility, morphology, and by histopathologicalexamination of and epididymis (Working et al , 1988). 9.26 Daily production of sperm is different between species and is more efficient in rodents than in humans (Sharpe, 1994). Substantial reductions in sperm count can be induced in rodents before fertility isimpaired. In contrast, in humans, relatively low numbers of sperm are produced and small effects mayaffect fertility or time taken to achieve a pregnancy in some individuals. Therefore, rodents may not bea suitable model for effects on human sperm production and fertility (Spielmann, 1998). Mammary Gland Development 9.27 Rodent and human mammary gland development is very similar (Russo et al, 1990). In humans, mammary gland development takes place in two stages, formation (during organogenesis) and gland stimulationduring puberty. Reproductive cycles 9.28 In female mammals, ovulatory cycles occur with regular frequency. These involve growth of a follicle containing the oocyte (egg), ovulation of the mature oocyte and conversion of the ovulated follicles toa corpus luteum. A rise in oestrogen production characterises the period of follicular growth and a risein progesterone production signals that a corpus luteum has formed (and that ovulation of an egg hasoccurred). The corpus luteum will continue to produce progesterone for a set period (approximately 14days in the human) and will then degenerate unless pregnancy intervenes and 'rescues' the corpus luteumfrom degenerating. If pregnancy does not occur, new follicular growth commences and a new ovulatorycycle ensues.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 1829.29 Most mammals have similar ovulatory cycles but there are some differences. For example, rats and mice have very short (4-5 days) ovulatory cycles whereas primates have much longer ovulatory cycles (e.g.approximately 28 days in humans). A further difference is that many mammals, including rodents, ovulatenumerous eggs per cycle whereas primates usually ovulate only 1 or 2 eggs per cycle. Finally, in someprimates, but not in most rodents, the ovulatory cycle is 'menstrual', which refers to shedding of thelining of the womb as a result of loss of progesterone support for the womb lining with degeneration ofthe corpus luteum. Reproductive life-span 9.30 Healthy adult males continue to make sperm throughout the life cycle whereas women lose the capacity to reproduce at the menopause (approximately 45-50 years of age). The latter is a consequence of thedepletion of oocytes from the ovary. The number of oocytes in the ovary is determined during fetaldevelopment such that by around birth there are approximately 1-2 million oocytes in the human ovary.Fewer than 500 of these are destined to ovulate and the remainder will partially develop and thenundergo atresia (degeneration).183 Male Male or production (12-24 weeks) Brain masculanisation may period Plasma testosterone concentrations (1-5 months ) Organogenesis (5-8 weeks) spurt body weight 39 weeks)From ~9 years Testicular descent into scrotum (12-25 weeks) Sexual differentiation of internal reproductive structures and external genetalia (5-19 weeks) Resumption cycle ( 13yrs)~ ~Figure 9.4 Critical stages in human development.

Most of the published work hasbeen performed using laboratory animals, mainly rodent species. The extrapolation and interpretation ofthis research to humans is complicated by a number of species differences, most notably in sexualdevelopment and reproductive function. A small number of studies has been conducted in non-humanprimates, which are of more relevance in terms of human risk assessment. However, there are ethicalconsiderations that limit the use of these experimental models. 9.33 Factors such as species, age, gender, diet, dose, route of administration and metabolism, strongly influence the ultimate biological response to phytoestrogen exposure (see Chapter 8). A major limitationto the interpretation of experimental research on phytoestrogens is that many studies do not reportdoses on a body weight basis (mg of compound/kg bw/ day). Therefore, comparisons between studiescannot always be made. Also, many studies have used the subcutaneous route of administration. Thisroute by-passes gut microflora and hepatic first pass metabolism, which has a major impact on thebiological potency of phytoestrogens. Additionally, many studies have not administered purifiedphytoestrogens but used rodent diets supplemented with soy or flaxseed as a source of isoflavones orlignans, respectively. This complicates interpretation as the phytoestrogen content is oftenundetermined and other active constituents in soy or flaxseed may modify the biological response. Studies on the effects of phytoestrogens on rodents Isoflavones 9.34 The biological effects of isoflavones or soy have been examined during the following periods in the rodent life-cycle: In utero exposure Perinatal exposure Exposure during the neonatal, prepubertal and/ pubertal Continued and/ or pubertal periods Multigeneration studiesCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 186In utero exposure 9.35 As yet, only two studies have restricted exposure to isoflavones to the in utero period. In the first study, pregnant rats received a subcutaneous injection of various concentrations of genistein (0, 5or 25 mg/ day), on gestational days 16-20 (Levy et al , 1995). No differences in litter size were observed between treatment groups, although birth weights were lower in the offspring exposed to 25 mggenistein/ day. Delayed sexual maturation of the female offspring was reported although the effect wasnot dose-dependent. Female offspring were ovariectomised to allow assessment of pituitary function.There was no difference in pituitary responsiveness to GnRH stimulation between treatment groups. 9.36 The second study examined the effect of in utero exposure on mammary gland development in female mice (Hilakivi-Clarke et al , 1998). Pregnant mice were administered genistein (20 /H9262g/ day) by subcutaneous injection from days 15-20 of gestation. In the female offspring, advanced mammary glandproliferation and differentiation as well as the time of vaginal opening was evident. Perinatal exposure 9.37 A number of studies have been published on the effects of isoflavone exposure during the perinatal period (gestation and lactation). 9.38 Pregnant rats received dietary genistein (5 mg/kg diet estimated to approximate 0.2 mg/kg bw/ day) from gestational day 17 (Awoniyi et al , 1998). After weaning, female offspring continued on the genistein diet or were switched to an isoflavone-free diet until PND 70. A significant reduction in absolute ovary anduterus weights as well as plasma oestradiol and progesterone concentrations was observed in bothtreatment groups at PND 21. However, these differences were not apparent at PND 70. The time ofvaginal opening was unaffected, however irregular oestrus cyclicity was noted in 25% of animals (treatedup to PND 21) compared with controls (12%). Irregular oestrus was also found in similar numbers ofanimals (27%) treated until PND 70 suggesting that exposure to genistein in the pre-weaning period wasresponsible (see paragraph 9.21). Histological examination of the ovary and uterus revealedmorphological abnormalities and fewer functional corpora lutea in animals from both treatment groups(Awoniyi et al , 1998). Effects in male offspring were not reported in this study. 9.39 In contrast, a study by Kang et al (2002) showed that when genistein was administered at doses higher than in the previous study no long-term effects on sexual development were apparent. Pregnant ratsreceived genistein by oral gavage during gestation and lactation (0, 0.4 or 4 mg/kg bw/ day). No significantdifferences in offspring weights, gender, litter size or male and female anogenital distance were observedbetween treatment groups. No effects on time of vaginal opening were evident in female offspring. Noeffects on sperm count or sperm motility were noted in male offspring. There were no differences inreproductive organ weights or histology in either sex at PND 100.1879.40 In a study by Casanova et al (1999), pregnant rats were fed genistein supplemented diets (0, 160, 200 or 1000 mg genistein/kg of feed) during gestation and the offspring were maintained on these diets untilpuberty. No significant differences in the litter size or birth weights were observed between the differenttreatment groups. In female offspring in the highest treatment group, the time of vaginal opening wasaccelerated ( /H110222 days) and relative uterine weights (at PND 21) were significantly increased compared with controls. In male offspring, no effect on the age of preputial separation or testes and prostate weightswere apparent between treatment groups. 9.41 A study by Fritz et al (1998) suggests that exposure to dietary genistein can advance mammary gland development. In this study, dietary genistein (0, 25 or 250 mg/kg diet) administered to pregnant ratsduring the gestational and lactational periods did not alter time of vaginal opening, uterine weight,mammary gland size or vaginal, uterine and ovarian histopathology in the female offspring. However, adose-dependent advance in the differentiation of the primary mammary ductile structures was reported.In male offspring, the time of testes descent was not altered in the treated groups (the histopathologyof the male reproductive organs was not examined). Serum concentrations of total and free genisteinwere approximately 1.8 and 0.1 /H9262M measured at PND 21 after administration of the highest dose (Fritz et al, 1998). 9.42 Exposure to isoflavones, given as soy in the diet, affected the sexual maturation of female rats but did not impact on subsequent mating and fertility. Female mice received a diet supplemented with soyextract (0, 0.7, 1.2 or 2.4% (w/w), equivalent 0, 840, 1440 and 2880 mg isoflavones/kg, respectively)from weaning, through adulthood until 7 days after delivery of their first litter (Gallo et al, 1999). Vaginal opening occurred significantly earlier in all treatment groups. In animals in the highest dose group,oestrus cycle lengths were significantly longer. In addition, relative uterine weight was increased. Vaginalinflammation, hyperkeratosis and dyskeratosis and ovarian oedema, endothelial hyperplasia andleucocytic infiltration were noted on histological examination. No significant differences in the numberof pregnancies, gestational time, number of offspring produced or the characteristics of the littersbetween treatment groups were reported. Although dietary soy resulted in advanced puberty,lengthened oestrus and induced abnormalities in the reproductive tissues, this did not affect significantlythe fertility of female rodents. The effects of soy on sexual maturation and fertility in the male were notevaluated in this study. 9.43 In a study by Cotroneo et al (2001), no effects on plasma concentrations of sex hormones or expression of uterine sex hormone receptors were apparent in the offspring of female rats treated with genistein(250 mg/kg diet) throughout pregnancy and lactation. Exposure during the neonatal, prepubertal and/ or pubertal periods 9.44 The effects of isoflavones on pre-weaning development and subsequent sexual development and function have been examined in rodents. The neonatal (PND 1-10) and prepubertal (PND 11-21) stages area particularly sensitive stage of rodent development as maturation of the reproductive organs takesplace during this time.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 1889.45 Subcutaneous treatment of female rats (males were not examined) with genistein (500 mg/kg bw/ day) either during the neonatal or prepubertal stage had differing effects (Lamartiniere et al, 1998). Treatment during the neonatal stage (PND 2, 4 and 6) resulted in significantly decreased uterine weights at PND 21and 50, as well as a reduction in plasma progesterone and the number of corpora lutea, and an increasein the numbers of atretic antral and growing follicles at PND 50. In contrast, treatment during theprepubertal stage (PND 16, 18 and 20) caused a significant but transient increase in uterine weight at PND22, however the uterine weight had normalised by PND 50 and no effects on plasma progesterone levelor on ovarian follicular development were reported. However, prepubertal treatment resulted in earlydifferentiation of mammary tissue. 9.46 Genistein when administered subcutaneously at relatively high concentrations (500 mg/kg bw/ day) can induce oestrogenic effects in both intact and ovariectomised animals. The comparative sensitivity ofintact and ovariectomised prepubertal female rats (males were not examined in this study) to genisteinwas examined by Cotroneo et al (2001). In this study, animals received a subcutaneous injection of genistein (500 mg/kg bw/ day) on PND 16, 18 and 20. After treatment, the plasma concentration ofgenistein was approximately 5.6 /H9262M (2 /H9262M unconjugated genistein). Relative uterine weights were significantly increased at PND 21 in both ovariectomised and intact animals with hypertrophy of theluminal and glandular epithelia of the uterus. An increase in progesterone receptor concentration butdecreased ER /H9251and androgen receptor concentrations was evident in the uterus of both intact and ovariectomised animals. ER /H9251expression was still lower in treated animals at PND 50, but not PND 100 (ER/H9252was not analysed). Sex hormone concentrations were measured in intact animals. Genistein treatment increased oestradiol, reduced progesterone and had no effect on testosterone plasmaconcentrations. 9.47 Equivalent increases in uterine weight were observed after subcutaneous administration of genistein (50 mg/kg bw/ day) or DES to female mice on PND 1-5 (Newbold et al, 2001). After 18 months, animals in both treatment groups developed abnormalities of the reproductive tractincluding cystic ovaries, absence of corpora lutea, abnormal oviducts, squamous metaplasia, atypicalhyperplasia of the uterus increased incidence of uterine adenocarcinoma (35% and 31% forgenistein and DES, respectively). A parallel study in male animals was not conducted. 9.48 In a comparative study of male and female neonatal rats, animals were dosed subcutaneously with genistein (0, 0.2 or 4 mg/kg bw/ day) from PND 1-6 and orally (0, 4 or 40 mg genistein/kg bw/ day) fromPND 7-21 (Lewis et al , 2002). Dose equivalence studies showed that the subcutaneous doses would provide plasma concentrations of genistein equivalent to oral doses of 4 or 40 mg genistein/kg bw/ day,respectively, although the subcutaneous route does not allow for conjugation by first pass metabolism.In females, increased uterine weights at PND 22, advancement of the time of vaginal opening, permanentoestrus and reduced plasma progesterone concentrations were evident in animals dosed with 40 mggenistein/kg bw/ day. No effects were evident in females dosed with 4 mg genistein/kg bw/ day. In males,no consistent effects with treatment were reported.1899.49 In a series of studies, Hughes (1988) and Hughes et al (1991a and b) studied GnRH-induced LH release in female ovariectomised rats administered with genistein by intravenous injection (single dose of 0.01, 0.1,1 or 10 /H9262g/kg bw), oral gavage (single dose of 0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg bw) or subcutaneous injection (3 doses of 0.8 or 8 mg/kg bw/ day). Intravenous treatment with genistein inhibited LH doses of 0.01and 10 /H9262g/kg bw but LH release was enhanced at the 0.1 /H9262g/kg bw dose and did not differ from controls at the 1 /H9262g/kg bw dose (Hughes et al, 1988). In contrast, oral administration of genistein had no effect on LH release (Hughes et al , 1991a) and subcutaneous administration of genistein inhibited LH release (Hughes et al , 1991b). 9.50 When female rats (effects in the male were not examined) were fed soy- or cows' milk-based infant formula from induced uterotrophic responses (Ashby et al , 2000). The most marked response was seen in animals fed soy infant formula, however, the effects could notbe causally associated to the isoflavone content as the isoflavone-free cows' milk formula had similaractivity. Vaginal opening and first oestrus were advanced when soy formula feeding was continued fromPND 21-55 (the effect of cows' milk formula feeding on these parameters was not tested). In contrast,oestrogenic effects were not observed when ovariectomised animals were fed soy formula suggestingmodulation of endogenous oestrogens rather than direct action on reproductive tissues as themechanism of action. Co-administration of inhibitors of sex hormone production with the soy formulalent support to this mechanism (see paragraphs 7.22-7.23). Assessment of the daily intake of the soyformula indicated that rodents consumed three times as much as human infants. When the formula wasdiluted to provide the animals with the equivalent intake on a body weight basis to human infants, noeffects on sexual development were reported. 9.51 Genistein in the diet can induce oestrogenic effects on the uterus and mammary glands as well as hypothalamic-pituitary axis in ovariectomised female rats (Santell et al , 1997). In this study, dietary genistein (750 mg/kg diet) administered from PND 70 for 5-14 days inhibited ovariectomy-inducedmammary gland regression and increased uterine weights. Prolactin secretion was also stimulatedindicating that genistein can act on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. 9.52 In contrast, no oestrogenic effects were reported in a study of ovariectomised PND 40 rats fed either a soy diet or a soy diet with reduced isoflavone content for a period of two months (Tansey et al , 1998). No effects on vaginal cornification or uterus weight were reported for either diet suggesting that soy-containing diets may not be able to compensate for the loss of endogenous oestrogens. The isoflavonecontent of the soy was not reported in this study, but it is possible the intake of genistein from the soyin the diets was not comparable with that used in the study by Santell et al (1997). 9.53 Subcutaneous administration of genistein (4 mg/kg bw/ day) to male rats on alternate days between PND 2-18 significantly increased germ cell apoptosis, andreduced testis cell volume ratio by PND 18 (Atanassova et al, 1999). No effects on inhibin B concentrations and Sertoli cell nuclear volume were observed. Other than the reduction of spermatocyte/Sertoli cell volume ratio, the differences between genistein treatedand control animals were undetectable at PND 25 and differences in testis weight were no longer evidentCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 190in adulthood. When the reproductive function of these animals was assessed at adulthood, a trend towards a reduction in the number of mating events and litter size was reported but it was notstatistically significant. 9.54 However, lifetime exposure to soy did delay male reproductive development with manifestations detected in adulthood in rats. A lifetime exposure to a soy-containing diet (15.5% soy flour) resulted inincreased FSH concentrations and reduced body and testis weight compared with animals fed a soy-freediet. All of the observed changes were significant but of small magnitude (Atanassova et al , 2000). 9.55 In a study by Weber et al (2001), reduced body and prostate weight and plasma testosterone and androstenedione levels were evident in male rats fed a soy-containing diet (600 mg isoflavones/kg) fromPND 50 for 5 weeks compared with animals fed an isoflavone-free diet. However, no significantdifferences in plasma LH and oestradiol levels or 5 /H9251-reductase activity were reported. A parallel study was not conducted in female animals. 9.56 A comparative study on the effects of subcutaneous administration of genistein (4 mg/kg bw/ day) to male rats on PND 2-12 showed that in contrast to DES, genistein treatment had no effect on grossmorphology or sex hormone receptor expression in the seminal vesicles (Williams et al , 2001b). 9.57 When genistein was administered by subcutaneous injection to neonatal male mice (effects in female mice were not examined) on PND 1-3 at a dose level of 1 mg/ animal/ day (which equates to /H11011500 mg/kg bw/ day) a persistent reduction in ventral lobe and relative prostate weights was observed in adulthood(Strauss et al, 1998). In a further experiment in adult male mice, genistein (2.5 mg/kg bw/ day) administered by subcutaneous injection for days reduced testicular and serum testosterone and pituitary LHconcentrations and prostate weight (Strauss et al , 1998). 9.58 In a study of spontaneous vulvar carcinoma incidence, female weaning mice were fed various isoflavone diets (0-228 mg isoflavones/kg diet) (Thigpen et al , 2001). After 3 months the incidence of vulvar carcinoma in the highest treatment group was significantly greater compared with the control group(6/16 versus 12/16 animals for the control and high treatment groups, respectively). 9.59 The effect of exogenous oestrogens on sexual development and fertility was examined in the male offspring of mice (female offspring were not examined) administered with either DES (0-50 /H9262g/ day) or genistein et al , 2001). A dose- dependent reduction in relative testis weight, sperm count and sperm motility was observed in DEStreated mice but not in the genistein treated animals. However, ER /H9251and androgen receptor expression in the testes decreased dose-dependently with genistein and DES treatment. 9.60 Equol, a metabolite of daidzein has been shown to have oestrogenic activity. Subcutaneous administration of equol (10, 100 and 1000 /H9262g/ day) to female rats on PND 1-5 resulted in reduced relative uterine weights only in the highest treatment group at PND 25 (Medlock et al, 1995). However, this effect was transient, as no significant differences in uterine weight were evident at PND 60.1919.61 A study by Wang et al (1995) demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of formononetin (40 mg/kg bw/ day) for five days to ovariectomised female mice increased mammary gland proliferation3 fold. An increase in mammary gland oestrogen receptor expression and prolactin was also observed.The authors conclude that formononetin can act as an oestrogen receptor agonist in mammary tissueand may stimulate proliferation directly by inducing prolactin secretion viathe pituitary gland. 9.62 It is clear that isoflavones can produce effects on the sexual development of male and female rodents when administered at relatively high doses by subcutaneous injection. One study has examined theeffects of oral administration of genistein over a range of doses. Male and female neonatal rats wereadministered genistein (0, 12.5, 25, 50 or 100 bw/ day) by oral gavage on PND 1-5 (Nagao et al, 2001). In females, no effects on the time of vaginal opening or oestrus cycle length were noted in any of thetreatment groups. No significant effects on female mating were observed, but fertility was significantlyreduced in all of the treatment groups. Polyovular follicles were detected in treated but not in controlfemales. Atrophic ovaries with no corpora lutea were observed in rats in the 50 bw/ day groupand 5/10 in the 100 mg/kg bw/ day group in 18 week old females that had failed to become pregnant. 9.63 In males, the time of preputial separation, serum testosterone concentrations, sperm counts as well as testes, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate weights were comparable to controls. No effects on malemating or fertility were observed. The testes, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate werehistopathologically normal. These results that neonatal dosing of genistein can causedysfunction of postpubertal reproductive performance at doses /H1109112.5 mg/kg bw/ day as well as abnormal development of reproductive organs in female rats at doses /H1109150 mg/kg bw/ day. However, dietary genistein has little detectable effect on male reproductive development and fertility in doses upto 100 mg/kg bw/ day (Nagao et al prepubertal and/ or pubertal periods 9.64 A number of studies have been published on the effects of continued exposure to isoflavones through the perinatal and subsequent periods. In this study, pregnant rats received dietary genistein (5 mg/kg dietestimated to approximate 0.2 mg/kg bw/ day for an adult rat) from gestational day 17. After weaning,male offspring (female offspring were not examined) either continued on this diet or were switched toan isoflavone-free diet until PND 70 (Roberts et al, 2000). Epididymal weights were significantly reduced in both treatment groups at PND 130 but no effects on sperm counts were evident. LH concentrationswere significantly reduced at PND 21 and 130 in both treatment groups, but this reduction was notconsistently maintained, as LH concentrations were comparable to controls at PND 70. No effects onplasma testosterone or FSH concentrations were observed. These findings suggest that in rats, the criticalperiod of exposure to genistein is the perinatal period.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 1929.65 In a study by Lamartiniere et al (2002), female rats received dietary daidzein (0, 250 or 1000 mg/kg diet) prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. The offspring received the same diets up untilPND 50. There were no significant effects on the number of, or the ano-genital distances of, the offspring.The plasma concentrations of daidzein and equol were similar in both the pregnant females and thefetuses. In the female offspring, plasma progesterone concentrations were significantly reduced in thehighest dose group and oestradiol concentrations showed a dose dependent (non-significant) decrease.Mammary gland, uterine and ovarian weights were not significantly different between groups at PND 50and no histopathological changes were reported. Thus, in this study the only detectable effect onfemale sexual development was a reduction in plasma progesterone concentrations (a parallel study inmale offspring was not conducted). 9.66 The effects of genistein on the reproductive function and sexual development were examined following exposure of pregnant rats and their offspring. Animals were exposed to genistein (0, 300 or 800 mg/kgdiet) throughout gestation and lactation. The offspring continued on the same diet until PND 100 (Y ouet al, 2002). The exposure to the offspring was estimated at 44 and 125 mg/kg bw/ day (at PND 28-31) and 16 and 43 mg/kg/ day (at PND 97-100), for the intermediate and high doses, respectively. 9.67 Genistein had no effect on preputial separation in male offspring in this study. However, a dose- dependent advancement in the time of vaginal opening was observed in females. Genistein treatmentincreased the oestrus portion of the cycle and decreased metoestrus and dioestrus but the length of theoestrus cycle in rats was not affected. Treatment had no effect on sex-dependent locomotor activity.The histology of the male and female reproductive organs was normal (Y ou et al , 2002). 9.68 The effect of genistein on androgen and ER receptor expression in the prostate was examined in male rats exposed to genistein throughout gestation to PND 70 (0, 25 or 250 mg/kg diet). Treatment withgenistein reduced androgen receptor, ER /H9251and ER /H9252expression in the prostate in a dose-dependent manner. No differences in the histopathology or weight of the reproductive tract were evident betweentreatment groups (Fritz et al , 2002). 9.69 The oestrogenic effects of soy on the uterus and prostate of mice was examined following exposure to pregnant mice and their offspring (Makela et al , 1995). Pregnant mice were fed a 0 or 7% (w/w) soy diet (the isoflavone content was not determined) during gestation and lactation and the offspring werecontinued on these diets after weaning. DES was also administered to some animals on PND 1-3. In thefemale offspring, dietary soy and DES increased uterine weights in the immature animals. However, inanimals co-administered with soy and DES, exposure to soy reduced the uterotrophic effect of DES.Similar effects were observed in the prostate of male offspring. Prostate weights were increased at9 months in animals exposed to either soy or DES. However, soy exposure inhibited the prostatic growthinduced by DES treatment.193Multigeneration studies 9.70 The most rigorous assessment of fertility and development effects is through multigeneration studies. Typically these studies examine a number of aspects of male and female reproductive anddevelopmental toxicity (libido, fertility, pregnancy and lactation) as well as the effects on survival,growth, development and reproductive capacity of the offspring. These effects can be assessed over anumber of generations (Barlow et al , 2002). 9.71 Two studies have been conducted in rodents (Flynn et al , 2000; Badger et al , 2001). The scope of these studies was somewhat limited, as the full range of end-points was not assessed. 9.72 No effects on the rate or success of breeding, litter size, body and organ weight or birth length were observed following a multigenerational soy feeding study. Animals received a diet supplemented withsoy protein isolate over three generations (Badger et al, 2001). The age of onset of puberty did not differ in F 1males (as assessed by preputial gland separation) but vaginal opening was advanced (2 days) in F1females. In this study exposure to soy advanced puberty in females, but exposure to soy had no detectable effect on the reproductive capacity of male or female rats. However, the intake andisoflavone content of the soy diet was not reported which makes the findings difficult to extrapolate tolikely human exposures. 9.73 A study by Flynn et al (2000) showed that genistein had no effect on maternal nursing behaviour observed across and between generations when rats were fed genistein (500 mg/kg diet) over fourgenerations. 9.74 The data from the experimental studies of the effects of isoflavones and soy on rodents are summarised in Table 9.1.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 194 Timing of Route of Dose Results Reference exposure/Species administration (duration) In utero Rat s.c.

Exposure to coumestrol has been shown to induce arange of oestrogenic effects. 9.76 Increases in absolute uterine weight were reported after coumestrol was administered by subcutaneous injection (single injection of 50-200 /H9262g) or orally (50-100 /H9262g for 3 days) to immature female ovariectomised rats (Markaverich et al , 1995). 9.77 Similar findings were reported in studies by Ashby et al (1999) and Tinwell et al (2000). Coumestrol (60 mg/kg bw/ day) was administered by oral gavage to intact immature (Ashby et al , 1999), ovariectomised immature or ovariectomised mature female rats (Tinwell et al, 2000) on 3 consecutive days. Increases in uterine weight were evident from all treatments and were accompanied by uterine hyperplasia. 9.78 Subcutaneous administration of coumestrol (range 0.001-100 /H9262g/ day) during PND 1-5 advanced vaginal opening in mice at all doses (Burroughs et al , 1990a). At 20-22 months of age, abnormalities of the reproductive tract were observed such as cervicovaginal pegs and downgrowths at all doses except /H110915 /H9262g/ day) and absent corpora lutea (100 /H9262g/ day). These effects were also observed in a similar study of ovariectomised mice (Burroughs et al, 1990b). The effects of equivalent exposures in the male were not studied. 9.79 Two studies by Medlock et al (1995a and b) showed that coumestrol can produce effects similar to that of potent oestrogens such as diethylstilboestrol (DES) and oestradiol in female rat neonates.Subcutaneous administration of oestradiol, DES and coumestrol (100 /H9262g/ day) on PND 1-5 or 1-10 increased uterine weight by PND 5, but subsequently reduced uterine growth and suppressed uterineER/H9251levels by PND 25 compared to controls. When coumestrol was administered on PND 10-14 coumestrol inhibited uterine gland genesis. 9.80 No adverse effects on spermatogenesis or neuroendocrine function were reported in male mice (females mice were not examined) following neonatal exposure to coumestrol (100 /H9262g/ day) administered by subcutaneous on PND 1-5 (Awoniyi et al , 1997). Coumestrol had no effect on the weights of testes and sex accessory organs, or sperm count measured at PND 60. Similarly, therewere no significant changes in serum testosterone, LH and FSH concentrations. 9.81 In a study of GnRH-induced LH release, Hughes (1988) administered coumestrol (single dose in the range 0.01-10 /H9262g/kg bw) by intravenous injection to female ovariectomised rats. Treatment with coumestrol inhibited LH release at all doses. 9.82 Suppressed pituitary responsiveness to GnRH stimulation was reported when coumestrol (20 mg) was intravenously infused over 8.5 hours to adult female ovariectomised rats (McGarvey et al , 2001).1999.83 Dietary studies suggest that neonatal or prepubertal exposure to dietary coumestrol in relatively large doses (100 mg/kg diet) can produce long-term effects on reproductive parameters in both females andmales. 9.84 The effect of neonatal dietary exposure was examined in rats in two studies by Whitten et al (1993; 1995). Rats were exposed either during PND 1-10 or 1-21 viabreast milk from mothers fed coumestrol (100 mg/kg diet). After weaning, the offspring were switched to a coumestrol-free diet. In females, noeffect on the oestrus cycle was seen in animals treated for 10 days, however, the animals treatedthroughout lactation showed irregular oestrus cycling animalsexhibited persistent reduction in latency of mounting behaviour and ejaculation frequencywas observed in male offspring after 10 or 21 days of treatment. However, testis weights and plasmatestosterone levels were unaffected. 9.85 When immature female rats received dietary coumestrol (0, 50 or 100 mg/kg of diet) for 90 hours, a significant increase in progesterone receptor concentrations and uterine weight was observed at a doseof 100 mg/kg diet. When the treatment was extended to 180 hours, similar effects were seen in bothtreatment groups (Whitten et al , 1992). 9.86 In a further study, increased uterine and pituitary expression of progesterone receptors was observed in prepubertal female rats treated from PND 21-24 with 100 mg/kg coumestrol in the diet (Whitten &Naftolin, 1992). A longer term treatment was included in this experiment (PND 22-60) which resulted insignificant reductions in the time of vaginal opening and first oestrus. No differences in oestrus cyclicitywere found at first oestrus. However, by PND 116-131, irregular cycling was observed in approximately halfthe treated animals. 9.87 The data from the experimental studies of the effects of coumestrol on rodents are summarised in Table 9.2.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 200 Species Route of Dose Results Reference administration (duration) Rat (ovariectomised) s.c.

(continued)Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 202Lignans 9.88 Published studies have predominantly used flaxseed (linseed) as a source of lignans. Flaxseed is rich in the lignan secoisolariciresinol, but may also contain other active compounds, which makes a causativeassociation with biological effects difficult. However, comparative studies on the effects of flaxseed andpurified secoisolariciresinol do support the association. 9.89 Pregnant rats received secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (1.5 mg/ day) either by birth and weaning (Tou et al , 1998). The offspring received the flaxseed-free diet up until PND 132. No significant differences ingestation length, parturition, litter size, offspring survival or the ratio of males to females were observedin any treatment group. 9.90 Female animals in the 10% (w/w) flaxseed treatment group demonstrated early onset of puberty and lengthened oestrus cycles. In contrast, puberty was delayed in the secoisolariciresinol and 5% (w/w)flaxseed-exposed groups. In males, no effects were reported on testes, seminal vesicle or prostateweights in any treatment group. However, accessory sex gland and prostate weights were significantlygreater in the 10% (w/w) flaxseed group. These results suggest that perinatal exposure to compounds inflaxseed can produce hormonal effects in male and female rodents. Oestrogenic effects were observedin female rodents at relatively high doses although the delay of puberty in females suggests that flaxseedmay have anti-oestrogenic effects at lower doses (Tou et al , 1998). 9.91 In a study by Tou et al (1999), the offspring from mothers fed control, 5% or 10% (w/w) flaxseed diets throughout gestation and lactation were maintained on these diets until PND 132. Some animals fed thecontrol diet were switched to a diet containing 5% or oestrus prolonged and serum oestradiolconcentrations elevated at PND 50 and 132 compared with the other groups. In contrast, vaginal openingwas delayed with no effect on oestrus cyclicity in the 5% (w/w) flaxseed treatment group. Exposure toflaxseed limited to during the post-weaning period had no effect on age of vaginal opening or oestruscyclicity (Tou et al , 1999). 9.92 In males, elevated testosterone concentrations (at PND 132) and increased sex accessory gland, seminal vesicle, prostate and testes weights were reported only in the 10% (w/w) flaxseed group. When exposureto flaxseed was restricted to the post-weaning period there were no effects on male sex organs. Theresults suggest that exposure during the perinatal period is the critical time for induction of the observedeffects (Tou et al , 1999). 9.93 None of the effects noted in the previous studies (Tou et al , 1998; 1999) were observed in a study by Ward et al (2001). In this study, male and female rat offspring were exposed from birth viathe milk of mothers fed 10% (w/w) flaxseed or secoisolariciresinol (177 mg/kg diet lignan present in the 10% (w/w) flaxseed diet) and continued on these diets afterweaning. This suggests in utero exposure is the critical time for induction of the observed effects.2039.94 A study by Tou & Thompson (1999) suggests that perinatal exposure to lignans may promote differentiation of specific cells in mammary glands. When pregnant rats were fed a 10% (w/w) flaxseeddiet during gestation and lactation, early differentiation of mammary gland tissue was stimulated in thefemale offspring. Similar effects were reported from continuous exposure from the perinatal to thepost-weaning period. When exposure was limited to the post-weaning period, no effects were evident.Similar but weaker effects were observed when rats were fed a diet incorporating 5% (w/w) flaxseed orsecoisolariciresinol diglucoside (88 mg/kg diet, concentration of lignan inthe 5% (w/w) flaxseed diet). These results suggest that exposure to dietary lignans during the in utero and neonatal periods can accelerate breast maturation. 9.95 Male reproductive development and function were unaffected but alterations in sex hormone concentrations were observed following continuous exposure to flaxseed from gestation to adulthood.No significant differences in testis, seminal vesicle and epididymal weights, spermatid numbers,testosterone concentrations or sperm morphology were noted in the male offspring of rats on a dietsupplemented with 0%, 20% or 40% et al , 2000a). There was a dose dependent increase in the concentrations of plasma LH (but not FSH) and seminiferoustubule fluid (Sprando al, 2000a). No effects on testis structure and spermatogenesis were evident in animals in the treatment groups. An increase inplasma testosterone was noted only in the 40% flaxseed treatment group in a similar study by Sprandoet al (2000b). Parallel experiments were not conducted in females. 9.96 The data from the experimental studies of the effects of lignans or flaxseed on rodents are summarised in Table 9.3Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 204.

Few studies evaluating the effects of phytoestrogens on primates have beenpublished and often the number of animals used is small, making it difficult to evaluate the statisticalsignificance of the results. 9.98 The effects of equine oestrogens (used in hormone replacement therapy) and soy extract ( /H1101126.6 mg of genistein/ day for 6 months) on the vaginal cytology of ovariectomised cynomolgus macaques werecompared in a study by Cline et al (1996). Treatment with equine oestrogens induced marked vaginal maturation, whereas the soybean extract had no effect. 9.99 In a similar primate model, ovariectomised adult female macaques were treated with oestradiol, an isoflavone-rich soy protein isolate or were co-administered with both treatments daily for 6 months(Foth & Cline, 1998). Although the precise doses administered were not reported, they were described asbeing equivalent on an energy basis to doses of 1 mg oestradiol/ day and 148 mg soy protein isolate/ dayin the female adult human. No effects of soy protein on endometrial or mammary tissue were evidentafter 6 months of treatment. In contrast, uterine weights were significantly increased in the oestradioltreated group, which was accompanied by increased endometrial hyperplasia and proliferation ofmammary gland tissue. In this study, co-administration with soy protein isolate appeared to partiallyantagonise the effects of oestradiol on the mammary gland. 9.100 The effect of dietary soy on the plasma hormone concentrations was assessed in prepubertal female and male rhesus monkeys in a randomised cross-over study (Anthony et al, 1996). Animals were fed a diet supplemented with soy (containing either 1 or 9 mg isoflavones/kg diet) for 24 weeks of each arm. Nosignificant effects on plasma oestradiol, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, free thyroxineand sex hormone binding globulin concentrations or in uterine, prostatic and testicular weights betweenthe dietary groups. No significant differences in testicular weights or testicular histology were reportedin a longer term study in which prepubertal male cynomolgus monkeys were fed either a casein-, soy-or an isoflavone free soy-based diet for 14 months (Anthony et al , 1997). The isoflavone intake was not reported in this study. 9.101 Pregnant rhesus monkeys were fed genistein (8 mg/kg bw/ day) for 7 weeks in addition to a soy- containing diet (the isoflavone concentrations of the feed were not determined) (Harrison et al , 1999). No significant differences in maternal, fetal or placental weights were evident at delivery. A non-significant trend towards an increase in maternal plasma concentrations of oestrone anddehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and maternal and fetal progesterone concentrations was noted in thegenistein treated group. Serum oestradiol concentrations were 58% greater in maternal and 78% greaterin fetal genistein treated groups. No gross changes in villous morphology were evident as aresult of genistein treatment.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 2069.102 The effects of soy-based infant formulae on sexual development and fertility were investigated in male marmosets. Co-twin male marmosets were fed either cows' milk or soy-based infant formula from PND4/5 to 35/45 (Sharpe et al , 2002). Isoflavone intakes from soy formula were estimated at 1.6-3.5 mg/kg bw/ day. No differences in the intake of formula were evident between the twins. Blood samplescollected at PND 18 or 19 and PND 35-45 indicated that the testosterone surge was suppressed in the soyformula-fed animals. Mean testosterone concentrations ranged from 2.8-31 ng/mL in cows' milk formulafed animals compared with 1.2-3.1 ng/mL in soy formula fed animals. A paired comparison between twin-sets showed a 53-70% reduction in plasma testosterone levels in 11/13 of soy formula fed animals. 9.103 No differences in testis weights were evident between the feeding groups (at PND 35/45). Leydig cell numbers increased by an average of 74% in soy-formula fed animals, but no consistent differences inSertoli or germ cell numbers were evident. It might be expected that the decrease in testosteroneproduced could be due to decreased Leydig cell numbers, however, large increases in Leydig cellnumbers were found. 9.104 These results suggest that isoflavones (or other components in soy formula) can modulate testosterone concentrations in neonates and suppress the neonatal testosterone surge. In addition, soy formula canstimulate Leydig cell proliferation but has no effect on Sertoli or germ cell numbers. The impact or long-term consequences of these effects on the male reproductive system remain to be investigated. Anequivalent study in female primates has not been conducted. 9.105 The data from the experimental studies of the effects of genistein or soy on primates are summarised in Table 9.4.207PND - post natal day.Species Route of Dose Results Reference administration (duration) Rhesus monkeys Dietary (7 weeks) 8 mg genistein/kg bw/ day /bupmaternal & fetal oestradiol Harrison et al (1999) (pregnant) Cynomolgus Dietary (6 months) 26.6 mg genistein/ day No effects Cline et al (1996) monkeys (ovariectomised) Macaques Dietary (6 months) Soy protein isolate/ mammary gland to oestradiol antagonised by soy Rhesus monkeys Dietary (24 weeks) 9 mg isoflavones/kg bw/ day No change in serum oestradiol and Anthony et al (1996) (prepubertal) testosterone concentrations or prostate, testicle or uterine weight Marmosets Dietary (PND 4/5-35/45) soy infant formula /bdowntestosterone, 9.4: Effects of isoflavones or soya on primate development and fertility.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 208Studies on the effects of phytoestrogens in humans 9.106 Information on the effects of phytoestrogens on fertility and development in humans is limited. Anecdotal reports have suggested that plant-based compounds can produce oestrogenic effects inhumans. Abnormalities in the menstrual cycle of women working with hops and in Dutch womenconsuming tulip bulbs were associated with exposure to phytoestrogens (Milligan et al , 1999; Labov, 1977). 9.107 The effect of a maternal diet on the incidence of hypospadias (a disorder of male sexual differentiation) was investigated in boys (n=7928) born to mothers taking part in the Avon longitudinal study ofpregnancy and childhood (North & Golding, 2000). Hypospadias were identified in 51 individuals. Therewere significant differences in the proportion of hypospadia cases with vegetarian diet or ironsupplemented diets in the first half of pregnancy. Vegetarian mothers had an adjusted odds ratio of 4.99(95% CI 2.10-11.88) of giving birth to a boy with hypospadias compared with omnivores who did notsupplement their diet with iron (the odds ratio associated with dietary iron supplementation was 2.07(95% CI 1.00-4.32)). Hypospadias were also associated with influenza in the first 3 months of pregnancy(adjusted odds ratio 3.19 (95% CI 1.50-6.78)). The authors suggest the greater exposure to phytoestrogensfrom a vegetarian compared with the omnivorous diet may be a factor in the development ofhypospadias. However, the definition of vegetarian used in this study did not differentiate betweenvegetarian diets as defined by this report and other diets that included meat and no direct measurementof phytoestrogen exposure was conducted. 9.108 A matched pairs case control study of girls in Puerto Rico (n=120 pairs) with premature thelarche (breast development before 8 years of age), investigated the possible role of different factors including exposureto exogenous oestrogens in the aetiology of this condition (Freni-Titulaer et al , 1986). Details of dietary and environmental oestrogen exposure as well as maternal history of premature sexual developmentwere examined in a retrospective interview of the mothers. No conclusive associations were found insubjects aged /H110912 years at the onset of thelarche. However, significant associations were found between subjects experiencing thelarche before 2 years of age (n=85 pairs) and consumption of soy infant formula(univariant analysis: OR 2.2, (95% CI (95% CI 1.1-6.8)). Associations inthis group of individuals were also found with maternal ovarian cysts (multivariant analysis: OR 6.8, (95% CI 1.4-33.0)) and consumption fresh chicken (multivariant analysis: OR 4.9, (95% CI 1.1-21.9)).Advancement of puberty has been reported in populations in the United States, however, the underlyingcauses of this are unclear (Herman-Giddens et al , 1997; Kaplowitz et al , 2001). There have been no published reports of populations in which boys have experienced pubertal advancement. 9.109 The effects of isoflavones on sex hormone concentrations and semen quality have been investigated in a short-term intervention trial. A group of non-vegetarian men aged 18-35 years (n=15) were given astandardised soy extract (40 mg total isoflavone/ day) over a 2 month period (Mitchell et al, 2001). Mean plasma concentrations of total genistein and daidzein were 1 and 0.5 \u00b5M, respectively. Dietary supplementation with isoflavones did not affect volume, count, motility, morphology or testicular volume. Although it was a small study, the results indicate that short-term exposure to isoflavones (40 mg/ day) during adulthood does notappear to affect male sex hormone concentrations or semen quality. 9.110 A retrospective cohort study of male and female adults (20-34 years old) fed either soy (n=248) or cows' milk (n=563) formula as infants was reported by Strom et al (2001). The participants were identified from infant feeding studies and a survey of reproductive parameters (e.g. menstrual history, pubertalmaturation and pregnancy outcome) together with demographic and health characteristics, wereassessed by telephone questionnaires. However, the dietary intake of phytoestrogens was not estimated. 9.111 Over 30 different clinically relevant and potentially oestrogenic outcomes were assessed in the two groups but no statistically significant differences were observed in most outcomes. The soy-basedformula group did report longer duration of menstrual bleeding (+0.37 days (95% CI 0.06-0.68)) andgreater menstrual discomfort (RR 1.77 (95% CI 1.04-3.00)). However, the clinical significance of thesefindings to females is unclear and the authors suggest that given the large number of comparisonsevaluated these associations may be due to chance. Although many of the outcomes examined in thisstudy are dependent upon participant recall, the results do not suggest obvious associations betweenconsumption of soy-based infant formula and gross effects on male and female development andfertility (Strom et al , 2001). Interpretation of data in relation to human exposure 9.112 The data on rodents indicate that exposure to isoflavones, coumestrol and lignans can produce oestrogenic effects in males but may be more pronounced in females. Perinatal, neonatal or prepubertalexposures appears to produce the most marked effects. In studies of isoflavones, advancement ofpuberty and mammary gland tissue differentiation, irregular oestrus cycling and abnormal histology ofthe reproductive tract are the most common effects reported in females. However, alterations in sexhormone concentrations have also been reported in male and female animals. Data on coumestrolsuggest that this phytoestrogen is more potent, producing similar effects at lower doses, however fewstudies have been published. Published data suggest dietary secoisolariciresinol also producesoestrogenic effects in rodents. 9.113 Extrapolation of these data to humans are difficult for two reasons. Firstly, although the experimental data clearly demonstrate that phytoestrogens can produce oestrogenic effects in rodents, the humanhealth implications of these effects are unclear due to species differences in sexual development andexperimental considerations such as route of administration. 9.114 Secondly, data from human studies of the ADME of isoflavones (see Chapter 5) allow correlations between isoflavone intake and plasma concentrations to be made. However, there are few data to allowsimilar correlations between intake and plasma concentrations of isoflavones in rodents. Thus, it isdifficult to assess the oestrogenic effects observed in rodents in the context of likely human exposures.There is a paucity of data on human intake and ADME of coumestrol and the lignans.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 2109.115 Data from primate studies are more useful in terms of risk assessment but are limited in number and scope. The studies suggest that in utero and neonatal exposures to isoflavones can alter concentrations of endogenous sex hormones. The data from a comparative study of twinned malemarmosets fed soy- or cows' milk-based infant formula at equivalent human intakes show suppressionof the neonatal testosterone surge and an increase in Leydig cells in the testes. However, Sertoli or germcell numbers were unaffected (Sharpe et al , 2002). Although, the human health implications of these results are unclear they show that soy infant formula can alter parameters of sexual development in themale marmoset. 9.116 Human data on the effects of soy-based infant formula on sexual development are limited to two studies. One study specifically looked at the effects of soy infant formula but did not showassociations between soy-based infant formula and obvious adverse health effects, with the exceptionof small increases in the duration and discomfort of menstruation (Strom et al, 2001). The other study examining the possible associations between a number of dietary and environmental factors withpremature breast development in girls, reported a weak association with soy formula feeding (Freni-Titulaer et al , 1986). However, both studies were based on recall and did not involve any direct measurements of hormone levels or other parameters in the subjects. Human studies specificallyexamining the potential effects of in utero exposure to phytoestrogens have not been conducted. Key Points Testosterone produced by the fetal testes is essential for proper sexual development of the male. Development of the female is not hormone dependent. However, exposure of the male and femalefetus to oestrogens or androgens can disturb normal sexual differentiation, the potential effects beingdifferent in the male and female. For example, menstrual disturbances in females, or low sperm countsin males. The timing of exposure is a critical determinant of effect. Studies on the effects of phytoestrogens on human development and fertility are limited in number and scope. There are no published human studies examining the potential effects of in utero exposure to phytoestrogens. It is extremely difficult to examine the effects of phytoestrogens on human development and reproduction for both practical and ethical reasons. Hence most of the published research has beenconducted in laboratory animals such as rodents and to a lesser extent (for ethical reasons) inprimates. Significant species differences in sexual development between rodents, non-human primates and humans make the extrapolation of the data from in vivo experimental studies to humans extremely difficult. The rodent data are of limited use in human risk assessment as the human equivalents of oestrogenic responses in rodents are unclear. In addition, rodent experiments often administer much higher dosesthan those observed for dietary exposures in humans and use the subcutaneous route ofadministration, which excludes gastrointestinal and hepatic metabolism.211 Experiments in rodents suggest that coumestrol, and to a lesser extent genistein and secoisolariciresinol, produce oestrogenic effects in both male and female rodents but effects may bemore pronounced in the female rodent. Exposure during the perinatal, neonatal or prepubertal stagesof development produce the most marked effects. However, the significance of these effects such asalterations in sex hormone concentrations, advancement of vaginal opening, mammary glanddevelopment, irregular oestrus cyclicity and abnormal histology of the reproductive tract to humansis unclear. Dietary consumption of soy-based infant formula reduces the neonatal surge in testosterone and increases Leydig cell number in the testes of male marmosets. However, Sertoli or germ cell numberswere unaffected. The human health implications of these results are unclear. One human study published to date has specifically examined the effect of soy-based formula feeding on sexual development and fertility. The data do not provide evidence for obvious adverse clinicaleffects on sexual development or reproductive health with the exception of small increases in theduration and discomfort of menstruation. However, the study was based on recall and did not involveany direct measurements of hormone levels or other parameters in the subjects. References Adams NR.

Thethyroid hormones, known as tri-iodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T4), are synthesised in the gland from iodine and the amino acid tyrosine. The amount of T3and T4produced by the thyroid gland is controlled by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is secreted from the pituitary gland and is regulated by thecentral nervous system (CNS). A schematic representation of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretionis given in Figure 10.1. Figure 10.1 Control of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. The thyroid gland is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid axis and thyroid hormonesecretion is controlled by negative feedback (-). Thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH) from thehypothalamus stimulates thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary, which stimulatesthyroid hormone release. 10.2 Any inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis will result in an increased secretion of TSH by the pituitary as the body attempts to compensate for the reduced thyroxine concentration. However, greatly elevatedconcentrations of TSH can result in enlargement of the thyroid gland, a condition that is known as goitre.Hypothalamus Pituitary ThyroidTSHTRH T3 T4- -10. Effect of phytoestrogens on the thyroid gland and thyroid functionCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 222A number of compounds, including some that are naturally present in food, have been shown to cause goitre; these compounds being known collectively as goitrogens. 10.3 The development of the thyroid and the pituitary glands in the fetus occurs during weeks 10-12 of gestation. At this stage of development, both glands are relatively inactive and the fetus is dependenton placental transfer of T 4from the mother. From 18-24 weeks of gestation, the fetal pituitary begins to secrete TSH and fetal serum TSH concentrations rise, remaining relatively high between mid-gestationand term. The concentration of T 4also increases during this period. The concentration of T3in fetal serum is low throughout gestation, associated with low concentrations of deiodinase, an enzyme thatconverts T 4to T3. The levels of fetal T3increase modestly towards term and a sharp increase is observed within 2 hours following delivery. During fetal development there may be an increased sensitivity togoitrogens and studies suggest abnormalities arise when normal thyroid physiology is already disrupted(Morreale de Escobar et al , 1988; Thorpe-Beeston et al , 1992). 10.4 The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis operates as a feedback regulatory system. The decrease in the circulating concentration of thyroxine is met by an increase in TSH secretion from the pituitary, whichresults in a return of circulating thyroxine concentrations to a \"set\" point. In disease states where thereis excessive thyroxine production, pituitary TSH secretion is switched off. thyroxine productionis compromised (as in autoimmune hypothyroidism), the pituitary attempts to overcome the deficiencyin thyroxine by increased TSH secretion. This may be partly successful initially with normalisation ofthyroxine concentrations in the circulation at the expense of increased TSH secretion from the pituitary.As the disease process advances and more thyroid gland is destroyed, thyroxine concentrations fall andTSH concentrations rise. 10.5 The term goitre simply refers to an enlargement of the thyroid gland (see Table 10.1). This may occur in both hyper- and hypothyroidism. In hyperthyroidism, this is due to the presence of thyroid stimulatingantibodies, which have a trophic effect on the gland. In hypothyroidism, autoimmune destruction of thegland takes place so that the enlargement of the gland in this situation results from the increasedproduction of TSH along with infiltration of the gland by lymphocytes involved in the autoimmunedestructive process. Hypothyroidism may also occur in areas of iodine deficiency. Iodine is an essentialprecursor of thyroid hormone synthesis and therefore insufficient iodine in the diet reduces thyroidhormone levels, resulting in a compensatory increase in TSH and goitre. However, very high dietary iodineconcentrations (30 times the daily requirement of iodine, see paragraphs 10.23-10.24) can also preventthyroid hormone production by inhibiting thyroperoxidase (TPO) an enzyme involved in hormonebiosynthesis (Rang & Dale, 1987).223Table 10.1 Thyroid function tests in thyroid disease 10.6 Certain plants contain goitrogenic compounds that can interfere with the activity of the thyroid gland. For example, vegetables of the Brassicaceae family, particularly cabbage and turnip, contain a precursor of the anti-thyroid agent, goitrin. Goitrin prevents iodine uptake by the thyroid and the production of T3 and T4. This results in an increase in TSH levels, ultimately resulting in goitre. In both the Sudan and the Republic of Guinea, iodine deficiency together with consumption of large quantities of millet, whichcontains the goitrogenic compounds apigenin and luteolin, has et al , 1989; Sartelet et al , 1996). Soy and isoflavones: effects on the thyroid Animal studies 10.7 The goitrogenic activity of soybeans was first reported in the 1930s when studies showed that soy-fed rats developed goitre (McCarrison, 1933). Since then other studies have shown dietary soy or isoflavonescan affect the thyroid function of rodents. 10.8 A study by Filisetti & Lajolo (1981) demonstrated that feeding a defatted, non-autoclaved soy bean extract to rodents for 16 days caused an increase in thyroid weights and increased iodine uptake by the thyroid,whereas feeding a raw soybean extract increased thyroid weights but reduced iodine uptake. No effectson thyroid weight were observed in rodents fed a defatted, autoclaved soybean extract, although iodineuptake was slightly higher than controls. A subsequent feeding study for 29 days showed that a non-autoclaved soybean extract increased iodine uptake whereas an autoclaved extract inhibited iodineuptake. Measurement of thyroid hormones suggests this inhibition resulted in increased synthesis of T 3 and T4. The authors conclude that while heat treatment inactivated the component of soy responsible for effects on thyroid weight it did not inactivate the component responsible for altering iodine uptake.Condition Serum TSH concentration Serum free thyroxine concentration Hyperthyroidism Suppressed below normal range Elevated above normal range (overactivity of the thyroid gland) Euthyroid Within normal range Within normal range (normal function of the thyroid gland) Hypothyroidism Elevated above normal range Suppressed below normal range (underactivity of the thyroid gland)Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 22410.9 The effect of dietary soy on serum thyroid hormone concentrations was assessed in male rats and hamsters (Balmir et al, 1996). Animals were fed one of four diets for 4 weeks. The diets were similar in all respects with the exception of the source of protein added: isolated soy protein, isolated soy proteinextracted with organic solvent, casein or casein with 0.36 mg of the soy extract/g protein. The isoflavoneconcentrations of the diets were not reported. In rats, serum T 4concentrations were significantly higher in animals that consumed the soy extract supplemented casein diet compared with the other dietarygroups. In hamsters, serum T 4concentrations were significantly higher in animals fed extracted soy protein, non-extracted soy protein and casein supplemented with soy extract compared with thoseanimals fed casein. These studies show that dietary protein source and consumption of an extract of soycan influence blood thyroid hormone concentrations in both rats and hamsters. 10.10 The effects of soy protein isolate, soy protein concentrate (250 g/kg diet) or casein supplemented diets on thyroid hormone concentrations was assessed for 35 days in male hamsters (Potter et al, 1996). Serum T 4concentrations were significantly increased in animals fed soy protein isolate compared to controls. In a study by Mitsuma et al (1998), T3was increased and T4decreased in old (18 month) rats fed a soybean supplemented diet (isoflavones concentrations not determined) compared with rats fed a control diet. 10.11 Ikeda et al (2000) reported that a soybean supplemented (isoflavone concentrations not determined) and iodine deficient diet synergistically stimulated growth of the thyroid gland in female rats. Thyroidgland weights were significantly increased in rats fed an iodine deficient diet, with or without soybeansand T 4levels were significantly reduced in these groups compared with controls. Serum TSH levels were increased in rodents fed a soybean or an iodine deficient soybean diet. Histologically, rodents fed aniodine deficient soybean diet displayed diffuse follicular hyperplasia of the thyroid and indices ofproliferation were significantly higher. In a further study, ingestion of a soy supplemented diet(isoflavones concentrations not determined) to iodine deficient female rats resulted in increased thyroidgland weight (Ikeda et al , 2001). 10.12 A study by Son et al (2001) reported that dietary supplementation with isoflavones (400 or 2000 mg/kg diet) did not alter thyroid weights in female rats. However, thyroid weights were increased in rodents feddietary 20% (w/w) soy or an iodine deficient diet. A further increase in thyroid weight was observed inrodents fed an iodine deficient diet supplemented with dietary soy. Serum T 4levels were increased by dietary soy but decreased in iodine deficient diets combined with both soy and isoflavone diets. TSHwas increased by the iodine deficient diet and further increased in combination with dietary soy but notisoflavones. However, Chang & Doerge (2000) found no differences in T 3, T4, TSH concentrations or thyroid gland weight or histopathology in rats continuously fed a soy diet (60 mg genistein/kg diet)compared with control animals. Human studies 10.13 The effect of soy on thyroid function in animals has prompted investigations into the possible effects of soy and isoflavones on the thyroid gland in humans.225Effects in infants 10.14 In the 1950s and 60s, twelve cases of altered thyroid function in infants, associated with consumption of soy-based infant formula were reported (Hydovitz, Van Wyk et al, 1959). The reports however, were mostly of goitre, with no overt signs of hypothyroidism caused by iodine deficiency. Van Wyk et al (1959) suggested there were goitrogenic agents in the soy formula as heating or extraction with an organic solvent prior to feeding prevented developmentof goitre. 10.15 However, studies have suggested that the presence of goitrogens in formula may not have been the only cause of altered thyroid function. Van Middlesworth (1957) suggested that increased faecal mass due toa high fibre diet may also alter-enterohepatic circulation of thyroxine. This in turn may lower thyroidhormone concentrations and increase iodine demand. A study by Pinchera et al (1965) reported increased loss of 131I-labelled thyroxine in an athyreotic hypothyroid patient fed a soy formula (51% loss) when compared to a cow's milk formula (31.6% loss). These results indicate that the soy diet is responsible forthe increased loss of orally administered thyroxine. 10.16 As a result of these studies, changes to soy-based formulae were implemented in the 1960s. The goitrogenic effects of soy-based infant formula were subsequently overcome by using soy protein isolateinstead of soy flour, reducing the goitrogenic constituents of the formula and by supplementation of theformula with iodine (Fomon, 1993). Since this change in processing and formulation there have been noreports of goitre in infants fed soy-based formula in peer reviewed literature. 12 Effects in adults 10.17 Ishizuki et al (1991) examined the effects of consuming 30 g of soybeans/ day (isoflavone concentration not determined) on the thyroid function in 2 groups of Japanese men. In the first group, subjects (n=20)consumed soybeans daily for 1 month. Serum concentrations of thyroid hormones were unchanged butTSH levels were slightly elevated (p /H110210.01). In the second group, soybeans were administered daily for 3 months. No change in serum thyroid hormone concentrations was found. However, TSHconcentrations were raised and diffuse goitre and hypothyroidism was evident in half the subjects. Thesesymptoms disappeared within 1 month of cessation of soybean consumption. 10.18 Duncan et al (1999a) reported a decrease in T 3(p=0.02) concentrations in premenopausal women receiving 128 mg isoflavones/ day. However, the authors conclude that as no effects were seen on totalor free T 4or TSH, the results were unlikely to be physiologically important. 10.19 Duncan et al (1999b) reported changes in thyroid binding globulin (TBG) levels in postmenopausal women following supplementation with a diet containing a high (132 mg/ day) or low (65 mg/ day)isoflavone content compared to an isoflavone-free diet. A decrease in TBG levels was observed 12The Working Group is aware and has reviewed a number of anecdotal reports regarding the effects of phytoestrogens on the thyroid gland. However, no conclusions can be made from these reports as they have not been published in peer reviewed scientif ic literature or subjected to medical assessment.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 226following supplementation with the high isoflavone diet (p /H110210.05) however, the low isoflavone diet was reported to produce an increase (p /H110210.05) in TBG. In addition, the control diet was also shown to have reduced (p=0.03) TBG levels from baseline. The authors conclude that while the changes are significant,they may not be physiologically relevant. 10.20In a double blind trial, postmenopausal women consumed diets supplemented with soy protein (0, 56 or 90 mg isoflavones/ day) for 6 months (Persky et al, 2002). T 4concentrations were higher in the group fed 56 mg isoflavones/ day (p /H110210.05) compared with controls. T3(p=0.03) and TSH (p=0.01) concentrations were higher in the group fed 90 mg isoflavones/ day at 6 months compared with controls. The authorssuggest that isoflavones may affect levels of thyroid hormones but considered the changes in hormoneconcentrations to be of too small a magnitude to be clinically important. 10.21 In a study by Jayagopal et al (2002), postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes (n=32) ingested a soy supplemented diet (132 mg isoflavones/ day) or placebo for 12 weeks in a randomised cross-overtrial. A small decrease (2.5%, p=0.004) in T 4concentration was found in subjects after dietary supplementation with soy compared with placebo. There was no change in TSH or T3concentrations. No dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate orandrostenedione concentrations were found. Iodine status of the UK population 10.22 As reported alterations in thyroid function have been associated with lowered iodine intake, it is possible that people most likely to be affected are those living in geographical areas where dietary iodine intakesare not ideal. To protect against iodine deficiency, the Committee of Medical Aspects of Food Policy(COMA) has recommended a Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) for adults of 0.14 mg/ day and between0.05-0.14 mg/ day for children. In the UK, cows' milk is the main source of dietary exposure to iodine anda survey carried out during 1998-1999 found that the average iodine concentration of milk was 0.31 mg/kg(MAFF Surveillance Information Sheet, No. 198, 1999). No specific information on the intake of iodinefrom vegetarian or vegan diets is available. 10.23 In 1997, the average UK exposure to iodine was 0.25 mg/ day (Food Standards Agency, Information Sheet 05/00, 2000). This is within the range of estimates from the total diet surveys (TDS) reported in 1985(0.28 mg/ day), 1991 (0.17 mg/ day), and 1995 (0.21 mg/ day). This comparison shows that while there is somevariation in estimates of iodine exposure in different years, there is no consistent increase or decrease inintake over time. The estimated average UK exposure to iodine (0.24 mg/kg) is higher than that from theNew Zealand TDS (0.1 mg/kg) and to a lesser extent the Chinese TDS (0.17 mg/ day). All the estimatediodine exposures from this survey, including that for the high-level adult consumers, are below the JECFAPMTDI for iodine of 0.017 mg/kg bw/ day, which is equivalent to 1.0 mg/ day for a 60 kg person.227Possible mechanisms of isoflavone-thyroid interactions 10.24It has been hypothesised that phytoestrogens may interact with the thyroid gland by a number of potential mechanisms. Interaction with thyroperoxidase 10.25 Isoflavones have a similar chemical structure to T3and T4, which suggests they may be active in the thyroid (see Figure 10.2). Indeed in vitro studies demonstrated that the isoflavones, genistein, daidzein and biochanin A inhibited thyroperoxidase in the synthesis of T3and T4(Divi et al , 1997). These compounds acted substrates for iodination (Divi & Doerge, 1996; Divi et al, 1997). This effect was reversed following the addition of iodine. TPO catalyses the oxidation of iodide to iodine radical allowing of tyrosine during synthesis of T3and T4. If inhibition of TPO were to occur in vivo , concentrations of thyroid hormones would be reduced and potentially stimulate the production of TSH. Figure 10.2 The structural similarity of the thyroid hormones T3and T4, genistein and Genistein DaidzeinCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 228Table 10.2 Inhibition of thyroperoxidase (TPO) catalysed thyroid hormone al (1997); Divi & Doerge (1996). 10.26Chang & dietary with genistein (5-500 mg/kg), commencing in utero through weaning until termination of the study 20 weeks later, resulted in a dose- dependent reduction in microsomal thyroperoxidase (TPO) activity in rats. A reduction in TPO activitywas also observed in rats fed a standard soy-diet, containing 60 mg/kg total isoflavones, compared tothose fed a soy-depleted diet, containing 1 mg/kg total isoflavones. There were no differences in T 3, T4, TSH concentrations or thyroid gland weights or histopathology between the two groups. The authorssuggest that whilst reductions in TPO activity occurs concomitant to soy isoflavone consumption, theremaining activity is sufficient to maintain normal thyroid homeostasis. Interaction with thyroid binding globulin 10.27 Thyroid binding globulin (TBG) is a plasma protein involved in the inactivation and transport of T3and T4. It has been hypothesised that phytoestrogens could potentially increase TBG concentrations. Any such increase could transiently increase the binding capacity for thyroxine thus lowering free thyroxineconcentrations. In turn, TSH secretion would increase as the body attempted to restore free thyroxineconcentrations. In an euthyroid state, the thyroid could accommodate this however, if thyroid functionwas compromised (e.g. autoimmune disease) or if replacement therapy was not increased, theconcentration of free thyroxine would be expected to be lower. 10.28While it is possible that phytoestrogens may alter the concentrations of TBG there is no data to suggest phytoestrogens act by this mechanism to produce clinical effects. Potential thyroid-phytoestrogen interactions 10.29Whilst currently there is very little research into the possible outcomes of phytoestrogen interactions with the thyroid gland, a number of potential interactions are possible and have been outlined below:Compound Concentration ( /H9262M) % Inhibition Genistein 3.2 exposure to phytoestrogens are no data that suggest maternal ingestion of phytoestrogens during pregnancy has an influence on the development of the thyroid gland. A study by Hunter et al (2000) reported that, in Scotland, the prevalence of congenital hypothyroidism in the young ( /H1102122 years) is low, affecting only 0.135% of the population. Toublanc (1992) reported that countries, such as Japan (when data are matched for numberof people surveyed) which consume relatively higher quantities of soy than the UK, do not have asignificantly higher incidence of congenital hypothyroidism than either the UK or other developedcountries, where iodine deficiency is uncommon. These findings are in contrast with those expected ifsoy adversely affected the development of the thyroid gland. Maternal ingestion of phytoestrogens 10.31 Maternal thyroid function during early pregnancy is an important determinant of early fetal brain development. The fetal thyroid is unable to produce T4prior to weeks 12-14 of gestation thus, overt maternal hypothyroidism, as seen in iodine-deficient areas, is associated with severe neurologicalimpairment in the offspring. The results from two studies (Haddow et al , 1999; Pop et al , 1999) suggest that low maternal plasma thyroxine concentrations during early pregnancy are associated with a 4 pointreduction in overall IQ performance. However, at birth and subsequently, the children in these studieshad normal thyroid function. 10.32 It is possible that low iodine intake coupled with the increased metabolic demands of pregnancy and increased thyroxine need, as well as soy product ingestion, may lead to compromised thyroid function.In this situation, the fetus may receive reduced levels of thyroxine during early gestation. This situationcould adversely affect the neurological development of the fetus. Vegan diets and exposure to phytoestrogens 10.33 Key et al (1992) reported elevated TSH levels (p=0.001) in men consuming a vegan diet (n=48) compared to men consuming an omnivorous diet (n=53). Three of the vegan subjects with the highest TSH levelsreported taking kelp supplements, a rich source of iodine. However, even after excluding these subjects,the TSH concentration was significantly higher in vegans (p=0.012). The findings suggest a vegan diet maynot supply an adequate intake of iodine and thus, vegans may be more susceptible to the goitrogeniceffects of soy. Individuals with restrictive diets for example, in infants where high soy intake is coupledwith the exclusion of dairy produce and fish may also be more susceptible to goitrogenic effects (Labibet al , 1989). Interaction with thyroxine medication 10.34 Phytoestrogens could potentially interact with thyroxine medication, which is given to patients diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism. As previously outlined, phytoestrogens could alter TBGconcentrations and increase the binding capacity for thyroxine. If a fixed dose of thyroxine is used intreatment, ingestion of large amounts of phytoestrogens could lower the amount of thyroxine availablein the free (active) form.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 23010.35 Alterations in the concentration of TBG may not be the only mechanism by which phytoestrogens could disrupt thyroxine treatment (Chorazy et al , 1995; Jabbar et al , 1997). Studies in infants with congenital hypothyroidism have found that those fed soy-based infant formula have an increased requirement forthyroxine (above expected replacement levels). Indeed, a study by Jabbar et al (1997) estimated that as much as an 18-25% increase in thyroxine might be required. This increased requirement disappeared,however, once the soy-based formula was discontinued. In addition, clinicians and parents of thesechildren noted marked alterations in bowel habit, which also resolved following removal of the soy-based formula (Pinchera et al, 1965). This observation led the authors to speculate that increased removal of thyroxine in the faeces was the most likely explanation for the reduced thyroxine concentration. 10.36 In 1998, following recommendations from the New Zealand Ministry of Health, clinicians were advised to closely monitor thyroxine levels in infants with hypothyroidism who were fed soy-based infantformula or high levels of other soy-containing infant foods. It was suggested that in these infants, a higherthan usual level of thyroxine would be required to maintain a euthyroid state (New Zealand Ministry ofHealth, 1998). 10.37 It is also possible that the use of isoflavone-containing dietary supplements may interfere with thyroid medication used to maintain a euthyroid state in hypothyroid individuals. No data are available onestimated intakes of phytoestrogen from dietary supplements, however dietary exposure levels willincrease very significantly if individuals take these supplements. Thyroid autoimmunity 10.38 A study by Fort et al (1990) primarily investigating diabetes also reported an increased prevalence in thyroid disease amongst children fed soy-based infant formula as infants. This was a retrospectivetelephone recall study comparing cases of hypo- and hyperthyroidism in children with their siblings andother non-related controls. Of the infants fed soy-based formula, 31% developed autoimmune thyroiddisease compared to 7% of controls. A cause and effect relationship was not established. The study itselfwas limited by a number of confounding factors including recall bias by patients, which compromises theaccuracy of the information obtained. In addition, the small group numbers do not allow the results tobe adjusted for age, sex, or parental health status and dietary habits, which may also have contributedto the child's autoimmune disease. Thyroid cancer 10.39 A study in rodents has suggested that increases in serum TSH concentrations are associated with an increase in thyroid cancer (Thomas & Williams, 1999). However, few studies have investigated possibleassociations between dietary phytoestrogens and thyroid cancer. 10.40Kimura et al (1976) demonstrated that feeding an iodine deficient, defatted soybean diet to female rats for 6-12 months resulted in the development of hyperplastic goitre. In addition, thyroid carcinomas wereobserved histologically. The authors did not identify whether the soybeans were responsible forpromoting changes induced by iodine deficiency or if there were carcinogenic substances in the soybean.23110.41 In contrast, Son et al (2000a and b) investigated the effects of dietary genistein (25, 250 mg/kg diet) and a dietary isoflavone mixture (400 mg/kg diet) on thyroid carcinogenesis in a two-stage rodent model ofthyroid cancer. No differences in weight or histopathological lesions of the thyroid between the dietarygroups in either male or ovariectomised female rats were observed despite pre-treatment with a thyroidcancer promoter. The authors conclude these compounds do not exert a modifying effect on thyroidcarcinogenesis in rodents. 10.42 In humans, it is not clear whether elevated TSH increases the risk of thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer is more common in women than men and younger women are more likely to develop thyroid cancer. Thissuggests that oestrogen may play a role in the development of thyroid cancer. However, it is not clearwhether phytoestrogens can induce similar effects. 10.43 A retrospective case-control study examining the relationship between phytoestrogen consumption and risk of thyroid cancer was conducted in San Francisco (Horn-Ross et al, 2002). Assessment of the dietary patterns of women (cases= 608, controls= 558) was conducted using a food frequency questionnaire andphytoestrogen intake was estimated using a previously published database (Horn-Ross et al , 2000). The menopausal status of women in the study was also recorded (70%= premenopausal; 20%=postmenopausal for case and control groups, respectively). The results of the study suggested thatincreased consumption (highest versus lowest quintile) of unfermented soy-based foods andphytoestrogens was associated with a decreased risk of developing thyroid cancer (see Table 10.3). Table 10.3 Phytoestrogen consumption and thyroid cancer risk. Data set ashown in regular font is adjusted for age, race/ ethnicity, and daily calorific intake.

OR: Odds Ratio, CI: Confidence Interval. 10.44However, following correction for confounding variables, including family history of thyroid disease, the strength of the association between consumption of phytoestrogens and the lowered risk ofdeveloping thyroid cancer was reduced (as indicated by an increase in p values).Phytoestrogen Adjusted data aAdjusted data b OR 95% CI p value OR 95% CI p value Genistein 0.65 0.42 - 1.0 0.02 0.70 0.44 - 1.1 0.14 Daidzein 0.60 0.39 - 0.92 0.02 0.65 0.40 - Formononetin 0.35 - 0.89 0.009Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 232Key Points A number of scientific publications have drawn attention to the potential for soy-based infant formulae to affect thyroid function. They have focused largely on the effect of the formula on thyroidfunction tests and their potential interactions with thyroxine replacement therapy. Goitrogenic effects in infants fed soy flour-based infant formula were reported when it was first introduced in the 1960s. This problem was subsequently overcome by using soy protein isolate insteadof soy flour thus, reducing the goitrogenic constituents of the formula and by supplementation of theformula with iodine. There have been no reports of goitrogenic effects from soy-based infant formulain peer reviewed literature since the 1960s. The experimental data suggest that relatively high levels of dietary soy may have a goitrogenic effect in rodents deficient in dietary iodine. However, data from human studies suggest that dietary soy orisoflavones are unlikely to affect thyroid function in normal individuals with adequate iodine intake. It is possible that the isoflavone component of soy-based infant formula may have the capacity to inhibit thyroid function in infants. However, it has not been established whether the levels of freeisoflavones in the plasma of infants fed soy-based infant formula are sufficient to significantlyinfluence thyroid function. Due to the potential interactions between phytoestrogens and the thyroid gland, it is possible that the thyroid function of hypothyroid individuals consuming high levels of phytoestrogen- or goitrogen-richfoodstuffs and supplements may be adversely affected. There is a theoretical possibility that under circumstances in which the thyroid status of the mother is compromised, maternal exposure to high levels of phytoestrogens may impair normal developmentof the fetus. Elevated levels of serum TSH have been associated with an increase in thyroid cancer in rodents. The limited epidemiological evidence suggests that phytoestrogen exposure is not associated with thyroidcancer risk in humans.233References Balmir F, Stack R, Jeffrey E, Jimenez MD, Wang L, Potter SM.

The effects of a soybean product on thyroid function in humans. Pediatrics. 1959, 752-760.237Effects of phytoestrogens on the central nervous system Introduction 11.1 Oestrogen receptors are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) (Kuiper et al, 1998; Shughrue et al, 1997). Oestrogens are known to be active in a number of areas of the brain and spinal cord, where theyare thought to influence behaviour, movement, cognition, pain sensitivity and have a protective effecton the development of neurodegenerative diseases (McEwen, 1999). Therefore phytoestrogens may alsoexert similar effects in the CNS. Transfer of phytoestrogens to the CNS 11.2 In humans, the blood brain barrier is not fully developed at birth and for this reason the CNS may be more accessible to phytoestrogens in utero, or at birth. However, few studies have examined the transfer of phytoestrogens from the peripheral blood to the CNS. The published data indicates that transferacross the blood brain barrier in rodents is relatively inefficient (at least in adults), as concentrations ofisoflavones in the CNS are several orders of magnitude lower than in peripheral blood. A study byLephart et al (2000) showed that plasma levels of isoflavones were 36-fold greater than in the brain of adult rats given dietary isoflavones (600 mg/kg) for 35 days. 11.3 A study by Chang et al (2000), measured genistein in the serum and tissue of rats exposed to genistein (0-500 mg/kg of feed) in utero , viamaternal milk and in the diet. Endocrine-responsive tissues including brain showed dose-dependent increases in total genistein concentrations. Serum isoflavoneconcentrations in females and males were similar (e.g. 8 versus 6 /H9262mol/L, respectively at the highest dose) but were orders of magnitude less concentrated in brain tissue. The levels in females were highercompared with males (e.g. 7.3 versus 0.7 pmol/mg protein, respectively). Biochemical effects of phytoestrogens on the central nervous system (see Table 11.1) 11.4 Phytoestrogens have been shown to modulate a number of biochemical processes in the CNS (Lephart et al , 2002). Expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was increased in the brain of ovariectomised adult female rats fed on a soy bean or oestradiol supplemented diet for 8 weeks(Pan et al , 1999a; 1999b). 11.5 Calcium binding proteins in the brain such as calbindin and calretinin bind calcium and are thought to play a role in preventing neuronal cell death. Thus, it has been suggested these proteins may play aprotective role in neurodegenerative disorders. In a study by Lephart et al (2000), lower levels of calbindin and calretinin were found in the brain of adult male rats fed an isoflavone supplementeddiet (600 mg/kg) for 5 weeks. No effects on aromatase or 5 /H9251-reductase in the brain were observed. Similarly a study by Taylor et al (1999) reported that calbindin levels were reduced in the fetus of female but not male rats fed an isoflavone supplemented diet (200 mg/kg). However, Kim et al (2001) found that chronic (3 year) exposure to soy in the diet suppressed phosphorylation of tau, a microtubule-associated11. Phytoestrogens and the central nervous and immune systemsCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 238protein in the brains cynomolgus monkeys. Phosphorylation of tau has been implicated in neurodegeneration. 11.6 No significant effects on aromatase levels or sex hormone concentrations were evident in the brain of adult male rats fed an isoflavone supplemented diet (600 mg/kg) for 29 days (Weber et al, 2001). 11.7 Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of compounds involved in the inflammatory response associated with neurodegenerative disease. In a study by Lund et al (2001a), an increase in COX-2 was found in the brain tissue of adult male, but not female, rats fed an isoflavonesupplemented diet (600 mg/kg) during gestation, lactation through to adulthood. 11.8 The effect of coumestrol on oestrogen responsive receptors in the brain was examined in ER /H9251knock out and wild type ovariectomised mice. The mice were fed coumestrol (200 mg/kg diet) for 10 days fromPND 45 and some animals were also treated with physiological levels of oestradiol. Coumestroltreatment had no effect on progesterone receptor expression in the brain but did reduce plasma LHlevels. In contrast, oestradiol treatment increased progesterone receptor expression and decreasedplasma LH levels. The increase in progesterone receptors seen with oestradiol was attenuated whenanimals were co-administered with coumestrol and oestradiol. The effects of coumestrol and oestradiolwere markedly reduced in ER /H9251knock out animals suggesting the effects may be mediated by ER /H9251(Jacob et al , 2001). 11.9 These studies suggest that dietary phytoestrogens can modulate proteins involved in calcium binding and inflammation in the CNS. It is unclear if these changes have consequent functional effects and theimplications for human health are unknown. Behavioural effects of phytoestrogens (see Table 11.1) 11.10 A number of studies have shown that phytoestrogens can act on the CNS of rodents to cause behavioural effects. Patisaul et al (2001) showed that administration of a diet supplemented with isoflavones (46 mg/kg diet) for 5-6 days reduced mating behaviour in ovariectomised female rats primedwith oestrogens but had no effect in unprimed animals. The isoflavone diet increased ER\u00df mRNAexpression in the brain, whilst oestradiol treatment both alone or in combination with the isoflavonediet lowered the mRNA levels of ER\u00df. 11.11 Maze learning is used to assess visual-spatial memory (VSM) in rats with males normally outperforming female animals. Lund et al (2001a) reported an effect on maze learning in rats fed a phytoestrogen diet. The normal pattern of VSM was reversed in animals after lifelong exposure to an isoflavonesupplemented diet (600 mg/kg) with male rats showing a reduction in VSM and females having anincreased VSM. In a further experiment, rats were fed the isoflavone diet until PND 80 at which time theycontinued on this diet or were switched to an isoflavone-free diet. The females continuously fed theisoflavone diet outperformed those switched to the isoflavone free diet. The opposite effect wasobserved in the males.23911.12 No effect on locomotor activity was observed in adult ovariectomised mice treated with coumestrol (10 \u00b5g/kg bw/ day) by subcutaneous injection for 12 days (Garey et al , 2001). In contrast, locomotor activity was increased in oestradiol treated animals. However in co-administration experiments, coumestroltreatment lowered oestradiol-induced locomotor activity. 11.13 In a study by Flynn et al (2000), pregnant rats were fed genistein (0-100 mg/kg bw/ day) through gestation and lactation, and offspring continued on these diets after weaning. The offspring exposed to genisteinexhibited no significant differences in sexual dimorphic behaviours (open field activity, play behaviour,running wheel activity and consumption of saccharin and salt solutions) other than females in the topdose group, which displayed a preference to drinking salt solution. Effects of phytoestrogens on the sexually dimorphic nucleus preoptic area (see Table 11.1) 11.14 In rodents, the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) is located in the hypothalamic region of the brain. This area of the brain controls sex-specific patterns of sexualbehaviour, converts androgens to oestrogens and in response to endogenous oestrogens during neonatal development. The volume of the SDN-POA is larger in male rats compared with females. During the neonatal period the volume of theSDN-POA is responsive to the administration of exogenous oestrogens and can be used as a sensitivemarker of in vivo oestrogenic activity (Rhees et al , 1999). The structure of the hypothalamus is very different in rodents and humans and the human equivalent of the rodent SDN-POA has not been welldefined (Byne, 1998). Figure 11.1 SDN-POA in the rat. Vertical section through SDN-POA in an untreated male and female rat. The SDN-POA (circled) lies on eitherside of the third cerebral ventricle. SDN-POA volume is larger in male than female rats. Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 24011.15 Faber & Hughes (1993) examined the effects of neonatal exposure of genistein on the development of the SDN-POA and pituitary sensitivity to gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) was from PND 1-10. The volume of the SDN-POA was increased in the two highest treatment groups (500 and 1000 /H9262g genistein/ day). Pituitary responsiveness assessed by GnRH stimulated release of LH, was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner with genistein treatment ( /H11091100 /H9262g/ day). 11.16 A similar study, but in male and female neonatal rats was conducted (Lewis et al, 2002). Male and female rats were dosed subcutaneously with genistein (0.2 or 4 mg/kg bw/ 1-6 genistein/kg bw/ day) from PND 7-21. Dose equivalence studies showed that the subcutaneousdoses would provide plasma concentrations equivalent to oral doses of 4 or 40 mg genistein/kg bw/ day,respectively. The SDN-POA volume was slightly increased in female animals in the highest treatmentgroup at PND 44-57, but still remained significantly lower than the corresponding males. There were noeffects on SDN-POA volume in male rats and no effect on basal or GnRH stimulated LH secretion werereported at either dose level. 11.17 Male and female rats were exposed to an isoflavone supplemented diet (600 mg/kg diet) throughout gestation, lactation and thereafter until PND 80 when they continued on this diet or were switched toan isoflavone free diet (Lund et al , 2001b). Serum isoflavone concentrations were /H1102215 \u00b5M when measured in adulthood. An increase in SDN-POA volume was evident at PND 120 in males fedcontinuously on an isoflavone diet compared to those on an isoflavone-free diet. No such differenceswere reported in female animals. This study shows that dietary isoflavones can alter SDN-POA volumein adult male rodents. 11.18 The effect of neonatal exposure to coumestrol on SDN-POA development and pituitary responsiveness was studied in neonatal rats (Register et al, 1995). Both sexes received subcutaneous injections of coumestrol (0.1, 1 or 10 \u00b5g/ day) on PND 1-10 and were castrated on PND 21.

(continued)243The effects of phytoestrogens on cognitive function 11.19 To date, two studies have been published on the effect of soy on human cognitive function. The first study utilised subjects from the longitudinal Honolulu Heart Program study (White et al , 2000). The participants (Japanese-American men living in Hawaii, born between years 1900 to 1919) were initiallyrecruited in 1965, monitored for heart disease, stroke and cancer and interviewed on their foodconsumption on two occasions (1965-1967 and 1971-1974). In addition to these parameters, cognitivefunction was also assessed (between 1991 and 1993) in a number of individuals (n=3734, aged between 71-93 years). A stratified random sample of men from this group (n=948) underwent further evaluation toinvestigate the causes of cognitive function impairment. A number of subjects were accompanied bytheir partners (n=502) who were also assessed. Dietary assessments were conducted by food frequencyquestionnaire, which recorded the daily or weekly consumption pattern of 26 specific food and drinkitems including tofu. This data was also used to estimate tofu consumption of the participant's partners. 11.20 Cognitive function was assessed using cognitive abilities screening instrument (CASI) and where possible, neuropathology reports from autopsies and neuroimaging were also evaluated. Males who consumedtofu more frequently in midlife had higher rates of cognitive impairment compared with peers whoconsumed tofu less frequently (p=0.006). A similar association was found in women. However, thisassociation was based on their proxy assessment of tofu consumption. Calculation of odd ratios (whichprovides an estimate of a change in risk) showed that subjects who reported consuming /H110222 tofu servings/week had odds ratios (OR) in the range 1.6-2.85 for markers of cognitive impairment [i.e. poorcognitive test scores (OR 1.62, CI 1.06-2.46), low brain weight (OR 2.08, CI 0.97-11.47) and ventricularenlargement (OR 2.85, CI 0.73-11.16)] when compared with those eating /H110212 servings/week. The authors conclude the results are suggestive of an association in this population between tofu consumption inmidlife and diminished cognitive function later in life (White et al , 2000). However, this study is reliant on the accuracy of the tofu intake data and the results may have been influenced by inaccuraciesresulting from the imprecise nature of the methodology employed. 11.21 In the second study, File et al (2001) investigated the effects of soy on cognitive function in a 10-week placebo-controlled intervention trial of student volunteers aged between 22-30 years (n=15 male, n=12female). Subjects consumed omnivorous diets of equivalent calorific content containing 0.5 or 100 mgtotal isoflavones/ day. Both groups were matched for age, IQ, measures of anxiety and depression andcaffeine intake. Tests of cognitive function were assessed relative to a pre-study baseline and comparedwith the placebo group. Tests included measures of attention, short- and long-term memory and mood.Subjects in the high isoflavone group showed small improvements in tests of short and long termmemory (p /H110210.05), mental flexibility (p /H110210.05) and were rated as more restrained in a self-assessment of mood (p /H110210.05).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 244Key Points Oestrogens are active in the central nervous system (CNS) and thought to influence behaviour, movement, cognition, pain sensitivity and protect against development of neurodegenerative diseases. A small number of studies have examined the transfer of phytoestrogens from the peripheral blood to the CNS in rodents. The data suggest the blood brain barrier effectively restricts phytoestrogentransfer to the central nervous system in adult rodents. Studies in rodents suggest that dietary exposure to isoflavones ( /H11022200 mg/kg diet) can decrease the concentrations of proteins in the brain associated with protective effects against neurodegenerativediseases. However, the functional effects of these changes have not been determined and theirimplications for human health are unknown. Few studies have been conducted on the effects of phytoestrogens on rodent behaviour. However, these suggest dietary isoflavones can alter some sexually dimorphic behaviour in rodents such asdecreasing mating behaviour (females) and increasing (females) or decreasing (males) visual-spatialmemory. Studies have shown that isoflavones can alter the structure of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA), an area of the rodent brain controlling sexual behaviour. However, thehuman equivalent of the rodent SDN-POA has not been well defined thus, the implication of thesefindings to humans is unclear. Two studies have investigated the effect of soy or isoflavones on cognitive function in humans. One shows a weak association between consumption of a soy-based food (tofu) in mid-life and cognitiveimpairment in later life. However, this study is reliant on the accuracy of the tofu intake data used andthe results may have been influenced by inaccuracies resulting from the imprecise nature of themethodology employed. The other, a small placebo-controlled study, suggests short-termconsumption of high levels of isoflavones (100 mg/ day) may slightly improve memory.245Phytoestrogens and immune function Influence of sex hormones on immune function 11.22 It is well established that sex hormones can have a substantial impact on the immune system and on the integrity of immune function. Oestradiol is known to affect the development and organisation oflymphoid tissues and the activity of various cellular vectors of immune function. In general terms,females display more vigorous immune responses than males (Ansar Ahmed et al, 1985; Grossman, 1984). A feature of such gender differences is that in many instances autoimmune diseases are more commonin women than in men (Ansar Ahmed et al, 1999; Jacobson et al, 1997; Olsen & Kovacs, 1996). As reviewed by Ansar Ahmed (2000), the same gender differences are apparent in various animal models ofautoimmune diseases where it can be shown that oestrogens (or anti-androgens) may increase thesusceptibility of relatively disease-resistant male mice. 11.23 Oestrogens can modulate immunological responses and the mechanisms for these effects are complex. For example, in one investigation using mice it was found that oestrogens could simultaneously activatemacrophage production while depressing cell-mediated immunity (Luster et al , 1984). 11.24 There is evidence that oestrogen receptor activation can influence lymphoid development. In investigations by Erlandsson et al (2001), it was shown that in male mice ER /H9251, but not ER /H9252, is required for normal development of lymphoid tissue. Mice lacking ER /H9251(ERKO mice) exhibited hypoplasia of both the thymus and spleen and had increased numbers of immature (CD4 +/CD8+) thymocytes. Diethylstilboestrol immunotoxicity 11.25 Diethylstilboestrol (DES) is thought to cause disorders of the immune system in perinatal mice. Reversible thymic and splenic atrophy, decreased T-helper cell numbers and impaired natural killercell activity were found in perinatal mice exposed to DES. Human studies also suggest that in utero exposure to DES can affect T-cell and natural killer cell activity (reviewed in Giusti et al , 1995). An increased incidence of autoimmune disease has also been reported in people exposed in utero to DES (Golden et al , 1998; Vingerhoets et al , 1998). Given these observations, it is possible that phytoestrogens could, in principle, affect the immune system or immune function however, few studieshave examined this issue. In vitro studies of immune function 11.26 Genistein (37 \u00b5M) has been shown to inhibit human T-cell proliferation, interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and IL-2 receptor expression in vitro (Atluru & Atluru, 1991). Daidzein (0.01-10 \u00b5M) increased the proliferation of mouse splenocytes after activation with either concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide ina dose-dependent manner (Wang et al , 1997).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 24611.27 Sakabe et al (1999) proposed that oestrogens may regulate the function of the thymus gland as thymus epithelial cells were found to express oestrogen receptors. Inhibition of thymic hormone(thymosin- nM) and coumestrol (3 nM) administration. In vivo studies of immune function 11.28 Several investigations have sought to determine whether phytoestrogens influence the integrity of immune and inflammatory responses in animal models. 11.29 There is some evidence to suggest that isoflavones may display anti-inflammatory properties. Sadowska- Krowicka et al (1998) reported that genistein (0.1 mg/kg bw/ day) administered by subcutaneous injection for 7 days had a modest anti-inflammatory effect in a guinea pig model of inflammatory bowel disease.In separate investigations, Regal et al (2000) examined the influence of soy enriched diet on challenge- induced respiratory hypersensitivity reactions in sensitised guinea pigs. Although dietary exposure to soywas associated with a reduction in eosinophil accumulation, there was an increase in the volume ofbronchoalveolar lavage fluid. 11.30 Studies have reported increased activity of aspects of the immune function after exposure to the isoflavones, daidzein and genistein. In the first of these, Zhang et al (1997) investigated the effect of daidzein on immune function in vivo . Adult mice of both sexes were given daidzein (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg bw/ day) by gavage for 7 days. A significant increase in relative thymus (but not spleen) weight was seenat two dose levels (20 and 40 mg/kg bw/ day). Mice given daidzein (20 and 40 day) alsoexhibited increased phagocytic A significant increase incirculating T-lymphocyte number was evident in both these treatment groups. This suggests thatdaidzein at doses /H1102220 mg/kg bw/ day can alter immune function in mice. 11.31 A study by Guo et al (2001) examined the effect of genistein on immune function in a mouse tumour model. Adult female mice received genistein (0, 2, 6 or 20 mg/kg bw/ day) by oral gavage for 28 days.A dose-dependent increase in body, liver, spleen and lung weight was reported. No effect on thymusweight was reported. Genistein treatment (6 and 20 mg/kg bw/ day) significantly inhibited lung tumourformation but this was shown in vitro not to involve inhibition of tumour cell proliferation. In vitro assays of immune cell function showed increased activity of cell-mediated immunity mediated by cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells. IgM and IgG antibody numbers were not altered by treatment withgenistein. The suggestion was that genistein may exhibit anti-tumour activity viaa cellular immune mechanism. 11.32 In a further study by Guo et al (2002a), pregnant rats were fed genistein (0, 300 or 800 mg/kg diet) during gestation and lactation. Dietary genistein had no effect on maternal spleen or thymus weight orthymocyte numbers. However, a reduction in splenic lymphocyte numbers was reported in the highesttreatment group. The offspring were evaluated immunologically at PND 22. Dietary genistein had noeffect on relative thymus or spleen weight but a dose-dependent reduction in the numbers of a subsetof thymocytes (CD4 +CD8-cells) was apparent in male and female offspring. Natural killer cell activity was increased in male, but decreased in female offspring exposed to genistein (Guo et al , 2002a).24711.33 In another study by Guo et al (2002b), pregnant rats were fed genistein (25, 250 or 1250 mg/kg diet) from day 7 of gestation to the birth of their offspring and through lactation until PND 21 of the offspring. Afterweaning, the offspring were given the same feed as their mothers until PND 62. At the end of treatment,no dose-dependent changes in relative spleen or thymus weights were reported in the mothers or theoffspring. However, increases in natural killer cell activity and in T cell number were evident in themothers and the offspring, respectively. 11.34 The effect of genistein on various immune parameters was investigated in castrated adult mice used as a surrogate to model neonatal exposure (Yellayi et al , 2002). Adult ovariectomised female mice were placed on a phytoestrogen-free diet and subsequently injected for either 7 or 21 days with genistein(2-200 mg/kg bw/ day). A dose-dependent reduction in thymus weight was reported. In parallelexperiments, castrated male mice injected with genistein (200 mg/kg bw/ day) also displayed a significantreduction in thymus weight. Alterations in the phenotypic characteristics of thymocyte populations, asystemic lymphopenia and compromised humoral immune responses, were in ovariectomisedjuvenile animals injected with genistein (8-80 mg/kg bw/ day) for 5 weeks. 11.35 In further experiments, dietary genistein (1000 or 1500 mg/kg diet) administered to juvenile ovariectomised mice for 12 days also produced a dose-dependent reduction in thymic weight of similarmagnitude to that observed after injection of 8 mg genistein/kg bw/ day. The serum concentrations ofgenistein after dietary and subcutaneous exposure (8 mg genistein/kg bw/ day) were approximately 1 and4 /H9262M, respectively. Thus, the authors conclude that exposure to physiologically relevant levels of genistein is associated with significant changes in thymic development and specific immuneabnormalities in mice (Yellayi et al , 2002). However, the use of castrated animals in addition to species differences make it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the human health implications of these data. Human studies of immune function 11.36 An association between soy, and immune function has been reported by Zoppi et al (1983). Infants in the first year of life were fed either breast milk (n=27), or one of four different types of artificial feedincluding soy infant formula (n=7-9 for the feeding groups). The antibody response to bacterial and viralantigens after vaccination was monitored in each group. At 5 months infants fed human milk(1.6 g protein/kg bw/ day) or high protein cows milk (4.4 g protein/kg bw/ day) had \"protective\" antibodylevels. Antibody responses were lower (p /H110210.05) in infants fed on low protein cows' milk (1.8 g protein/kg bw/ day) and soy-based formula (4.6 g protein/kg bw/ day). However, it is not possible to attribute thechange in immune response to phytoestrogens, soy or the protein content of the infant formula. 11.37 More recently the influence of soy-based infant formulae on vaccine responses, morbidity and cellular immune parameters have been reported (Cordle et al, 2002; Ostrom et al , 2002). In these studies, comparisons were made between new-born term infants fed soy infant formula (n=186) and a cohort(n=81) where infants that were breast-fed exclusively until at least two months of age. Antibodyresponses to vaccines were measured, as was the distribution of immune cell sub-populations inperipheral blood. The authors concluded that infants fed soy formula showed no decrement in immunefunction, all antibody responses were within normal ranges and immune cell sub-populations werecomparable between groups (Cordle et al , 2002; Ostrom et al , 2002).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 24811.38 One study has examined the effects of dietary soy on immune function in adults. In this randomised cross-over trial (23 men and 18 postmenopausal women), acute-phase proteins and proinflammatorycytokines were measured in serum after consumption of control, soy (73 isoflavones/ day) or alcoholwashed soy (10 mg isoflavones/ day) diets for 1 month. No changes in these parameters were evident,other than an increase in interleukin-6 concentration (p /H110210.013) in women consuming the high isoflavone diet compared with the control diet (Jenkins et al , 2002). Key points Oestrogens are involved in the development and maintenance of normal immune function. In vitro studies show that phytoestrogens can influence some immune responses. Rodent studies on the effects of isoflavones on immune function have produced inconsistent results, reporting stimulatory, suppressive or no effects on the immune system. The relevance of theseobservations for human health is uncertain. One study of soy infant formula fed infants suggested isoflavones may adversely effect infant immunity. However, two more recent reports of a larger study indicate that there were no differencesin immune response between infants fed soy formula and those receiving breast milk.

Lancet. 1983, 2:11-13.253Introduction 12.1 Osteoporosis is characterised by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue with a consequent increase in bone fragility and risk of fracture (COMA, 1998). Bone mass is lost whenan imbalance between the cells responsible for the formation of bone (osteoblasts) and thoseresponsible for the resorption of bone (osteoclasts) occurs in favour of bone resorption. This imbalanceresults in bone structural failure and an increased likelihood of fracture. 12.2 Although heritable factors account for variability in bone health, secondary factors such as diet, physical activity and hormonal status are also known to be important. Studies in adolescents have indicated thatbone mass accumulation during puberty appears to be critical in the development of peak bone masswhich is thought to be achieved by early adulthood (Bachrach, 2001; Janz, 2002). Hence, bone status inpre- and peripubertal life is generally accepted to be a major determinant of osteoporosis in later life. 12.3 A range of factors are required to maintain good bone health, many of which are dependent on oestrogen. Osteoclastic activity is enhanced by oestrogen deficiency. Hence, osteoporosis is a particularproblem in postmenopausal women, due to the acceleration of bone loss associated with reduced levelsof oestrogen. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been shown to be effective in preventing boneloss (Felson et al , 1993). 12.4 The different character and incidence of osteoporosis and hip fractures in populations consuming relatively high levels of soy has prompted investigations into the oestrogenic activity of phytoestrogensand osteoporosis (Ito et al , 2001). Studies in animal models have shown that phytoestrogens can have a beneficial role in preventing bone loss following ovariectomy. However, the human data are limited andresults of intervention trials in both pre- and postmenopausal women have reported inconsistent results.Large, long-term studies in humans would be required before the efficacy of phytoestrogen containingfoods or supplements can be confirmed. Animal studies Isoflavones 12.5 Data from studies in rodents have demonstrated consistently that following ovariectomy, treatment with soy or soy-isoflavone enriched diets improves retention of bone mass (Anderson & Garner, 1998;Arjmandi et al , 1996, 1998a, 1998b). For example, Ishimi et al (2000) showed that following ovariectomy, subcutaneous administration of 0.7 mg/ day genistein to mice for 4 weeks markedly prevented bone lossand improved bone mineral density (BMD) at the distal femoral metaphysis. 12.6 Picherit et al (2000) showed that 10 mg/kg bw/ day daidzein given for 3 months was more effective than genistein at the same dose in preventing bone loss in ovariectomised rats. Coumestrol has also beenshown to improve femur bone mineral density in a similar rat model (Draper et al , 1997).12. Phytoestrogens and osteoporosisCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 25412.7 Studies combining genistein supplementation and resistance exercise training have demonstrated these treatments have synergistic effects in preventing bone loss. Genistein treatment and exerciseequally increased femoral BMD of ovariectomised rats by 5%, whereas combined treatment of genisteinand exercise resulted in 8% increase (Nakajima et al, 2001). Beneficial effects in preventing bone loss were also observed following combined treatments in a similar study in ovariectomised mice (Wu et al, 2001). 12.8 Although the mechanism of action of phytoestrogens on bone health is still unclear, it has been suggested that several mechanisms may be involved. Phytoestrogens may exert osteoprotective effectsby mimicking et 2002) or by stimulating osteoblastic bone formation (Fanti et al, 1998). Other studies have indicated that phytoestrogens may stimulate osteoblastic-derived paracrine factors that modulateosteoclast formation and activation (Spelsberg et al , 1999; Viereck et al, 2002) or suppress osteoclastic activity via tyrosine kinase inhibition (Blair et al , 1996). However, non-oestrogenic mechanisms or other properties of soy may also play a role. For example, enhanced intestinal absorption of soy-derivedcalcium may contribute to the bone conserving effects of soy (Omi et al , 1994). Lignans 12.9 A few studies have investigated the effects of lignans on osteoporosis. Ward et al (2001a; 2001b) examined the effect of flaxseed and purified lignans on bone strength in rats. In this study pregnant ratswere fed a phytoestrogen-free diet or diet supplemented with either 10% flaxseed (SDG). Offspring were exposedthroughout pregnancy and lactation after which they continued on the corresponding maternal dietsuntil adulthood. Offspring were examined after postnatal days (PND) 50 and 132 to represent adolescentand adult age groups, respectively. Femur weights and length did not change significantly on either dietor in any of the age groups. 12.10 A reduction in bone mechanical strength was observed in adolescent male rats fed the 10% flaxseed diet. No significant changes in bone mineral content (BMC) were noted in any males examined. The lack ofeffect on bone strength in groups fed a diet containing equivalent amounts of SDG indicates that anunidentified component, other than the flaxseed lignan, may be responsible for reduction of bonestrength. This reduction was not sustained into adulthood suggesting that consumption of flaxseed is notdetrimental to overall adult bone health in males (Ward et al , 2001a). 12.11 In contrast, adolescent female offspring fed SDG showed increased bone strength when compared with controls. This increase was not sustained until adulthood. Significant decreases in bone area and BMCwere also noted in females on the SDG supplemented diet. BMC decreased by 8% and 14% in adolescentand adult females, respectively. This suggests that female rat bone is more sensitive to the oestrogen-like action of lignans during early life when endogenous levels of sex hormones are low, but byadulthood the increased bone strength does not persist when compared with controls(Ward et al , 2001b).255Human studies (see Table 12.1) Epidemiological studies 12.12 A limited number of studies have been conducted in women to examine the relationship between phytoestrogen intake and osteoporosis. These studies have shown a beneficial effect of phytoestrogenson bone mass in the lumbar spine of peri- and postmenopausal women. No studies have beenconducted in men. 12.13 A prospective study (ten years) among Dutch postmenopausal women (n=70) investigated the association between long-term urinary excretion of phytoestrogens (as markers of habitual dietaryintake) and the rate of postmenopausal bone loss. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed noevidence for the preventative effects of low dose unsupplemented dietary intake of phytoestrogens(approximately 0.35 mg/g urinary creatinine as determined by excretion rates) on the rate of earlypostmenopausal cortical bone loss. However, enterolactone excretion was significantly higher (p /H110210.05) in subjects with a high rate ( /H328972.5%/year) of bone loss (Kardinaal et al, 1998). 12.14 A three year prospective study using food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) to study the relationship between soy intake and maintenance of BMD in the spine was carried out in a population of Hong KongChinese women (n=132). Despite the limitations of assessing soy intake and physical activity using foodfrequency and leisure questionnaires, significant differences (p /H110210.05) in spinal BMD regression were found among subjects in the highest (mean /H1101115 mg isoflavones/ day) and lowest (mean 1.4 mg/ day) soy intake groups. Mean loss in spinal BMD was 3.5% and 1.1% for low and high soy intake groups respectively.Age and body size were shown not to be confounding factors (Ho et al , 2001). 12.15 This is in contrast to findings in case-control study of postmenopausal osteoporotic Korean women who had lower urinary enterolactone levels (p /H110210.05) than controls when corrected for body mass (Kim et al, 2002). However, total urinary phytoestrogen excretion showed no correlation with BMD in these women (n=75) following a 24 hour analysis. The authors also note that the lower urinary enterolactonelevels may also be due to the Korean diet, which includes large amounts of rice instead of bread. 12.16 In a cross-sectional study of American women (n=3302), the association between dietary soy isoflavones (as measured by genistein intake) and BMD was investigated by Greendale et al (2002). In this study women aged 42-52 years were recruited from four ethnic backgrounds: Caucasian (n=1003), African-American (n=497), Chinese (n=200) and Japanese to determine dietary habits andestimate isoflavone intake. African-American and Caucasian women reported low or no genistein intakes(mean 0.5 and 1.4 mg genistein/ day, respectively) and analysis of the association between genistein andBMD was not pursued for these women.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 256Table 12.1 The effect of dietary soy or phytoestrogens on bone health and markers of bone retention in women.

Dalais et al (1998)Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 25812.18 In a cross-sectional study of healthy middle-aged (40 to 49 years) Japanese women, dietary intake of calcium was assessed by a FFQ on dietary calcium sources including milk, diary products, fish andsoybeans. A total of 995 women were recruited and BMD of the metacarpal was measured (Tsuchida et al, 1999). An independent association of weekly calcium intake from soy was noted (p=0.03). The authors suggest that calcium intake from soybeans and possibly from the isoflavone content may affect BMD inmiddle-aged Japanese women. 12.19 Using FFQs, a cross-sectional study in postmenopausal Japanese women (n=478) questioned subjects on their weekly, monthly, and yearly consumption of soy products (Somekawa et al , 2001). Subjects were also questioned on soy consumption when they were 40 years old. The study demonstrated thatfollowing adjustment for type of soy product, increased BMD was found to be weakly correlated withintake of fermented soybeans (p /H110210.01) and soybean curd (p /H110210.01). There was no correlation between BMD and other soy products. Following adjustment for weight and years since menopause, urinaryanalysis demonstrated that BMD was found to be significantly higher (p /H110210.001) in women with high (/H1102265 mg/ day) than low ( /H1102135 mg/ day) isoflavone intakes. While it is possible there are additional components in these soy products that prevent bone loss or stimulate bone formation (such as calciumor vitamin K 2) the results of this study suggest relatively high level consumption of soy products is associated with increased BMD in postmenopausal women. 12.20The relationship between dietary phytoestrogen intake and BMD was investigated in a cross-sectional study by Mei et al (2001) in southern Chinese women, aged 19-86 years based in Hong Kong (n=357 postmenopausal; n=298 premenopausal). flavonoid intakes were calculated using published databases. 12.21 The results were adjusted to allow for the following confounding factors: age, height, weight, and years since menopause, smoking, alcohol consumption, HRT usage and daily calcium intake. Data indicatedthat postmenopausal women with a relatively high intake ( /H1101147.4 mg/ day) of isoflavone had significantly higher BMD values at the lumbar spine and the neck of the thighbone (p=0.05) than those with a lowintake ( /H1101118.6 mg/ No significant association between dietary phytoestrogen intakes and BMD values were found in premenopausal women. There was also no association between lignan, coumestrolor flavonoid intake and BMD in either pre- or postmenopausal women (Mei et al , 2001). 12.22 In this study significant reduction in markers of bone formation and resorption, including osteocalcin and urinary N-telopeptide were evident in postmenopausal women with the relatively high isoflavoneintakes suggesting that the higher BMD is due to reduced bone turnover. Calcium intakes weresignificantly greater in postmenopausal women, especially in the mid (21.9 mg/ day) to high (47.4 mg/ day)isoflavone groups. Isoflavones may enhance the utilisation of calcium in bone formation resulting inincreased BMD in these women. Despite limitations in using FFQs and confounding factors includinghigher calcium intake by postmenopausal women, overall the study suggests relatively high habitualintake of isoflavones is associated with higher BMD at the lumbar spine and hip region inpostmenopausal women (Mei et al, 2001).25912.23 A cross-sectional study of 208 postmenopausal American women (aged 45-74 years) showed that dietary isoflavone consumption may be protective against bone loss (Kritz-Silverstein & Goodman-Gruen, 2002).Participants were recruited from various ethnic backgrounds including White, Hispanic, Asian, American-Indian and Black. A FFQ on the usual consumption of foods in the past year was completed. Thisincluded soy-based foods (e.g. tofu and soya milk) as well as consumption of other isoflavone-containingfoodstuffs such as beansprouts and soy sauce. Measurements of hip and spine BMD were taken alongwith biomarkers of alkalinephosphatase). 12.24 genistein was found to range from 0-13.9 mg/ day (mean of 1.3 mg/ day) with Asian women most likely to report consumption /H110221mg genistein/ day. A small but non-statistically significant association (p=0.07) was found between total isoflavone consumption and total spine BMD. Afteradjustment for age and obesity, women with the highest daily intake of dietary genistein were found tohave 18% lower urinary N-telopeptide concentrations (p=0.01) as compared with women who reportedno daily genistein consumption. Multiple regression analyses also intake(p=0.09). No other statistically significant differences were found between individual or total isoflavonesand markers of bone formation and BMD. The authors of this study suggest normal, unsupplementeddietary isoflavone consumption may be protective against bone loss in postmenopausal women througha reduction in bone resorption (Kritz-Silverstein & Goodman-Gruen, 2002). 12.25 In a cross-sectional study of 87 postmenopausal Japanese women, the association between BMD, soy intake and serum isoflavonoid concentrations was investigated by Nagata et al (2002). Intake of soy- based products and isoflavones was assessed over a year using a semi-quantitative questionnaire. Thesewere followed up with measurement serum bone ALP and BMD. Meanintake of soy products was estimated to be 62 g/ day with intake of soy-derived isoflavones of32 mg/ day. However, there were no significant correlations between soy product and isoflavone intakewith any of the bone health parameters measured after controlling for covariates including age, intakeof vegetable fat and carbohydrate. 12.26 In a similar cross-sectional study of 85 postmenopausal Japanese women, soy protein intake was significantly associated with BMD in the lumbar spine (Horiuchi et al , 2000). In this study, 60% of participants were osteopenic or osteoporotic and dietary intakes were assessed over a period of threedays. Intakes of soy protein (12.6 g/ day) were lumbar BMD (p=0.038) and withurinary deoxypyridinoline found with serum alkalinephosphatase or intact osteocalcin.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 260Intervention studies Soy or isoflavones 12.27 A number of intervention trials have investigated whether dietary supplementation with soy or isoflavones has a beneficial effect on BMD and BMC. However, intervention studies have not addressedthe possibility that exposure to phytoestrogens at an earlier life stage or over several life stages (as wouldhave occurred in populations that have traditionally consumed soy) has conferred some protectivechange on factors of bone health. 12.28 A randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled intervention trial showed that bone loss from the lumbar spine of perimenopausal women (n=69) was reduced following daily dietary intake, of soy proteinisolate containing 80.4 mg isoflavones, for 6 months (Alekel et al, 2000). Regression analyses showed that isoflavones were positively associated with the change in BMD (5.6%, p=0.023) and BMC (10.1%,p=0.0032). No significant changes were observed in women receiving soy protein isolate containing 4.4mg isoflavones. 12.29 A randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled intervention trial Potter et al (1998) demonstrated that isoflavone supplementation resulted in increases in both the BMC and BMD of thelumbar spine. In this study, hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women were first placed on a low fat,low cholesterol diet for at least 2 weeks. Subjects were then randomly assigned to one of threetreatment groups and received 0, 56 or 90 mg isoflavones/ day, for 6 months. Significant changes(p/H110210.05) in BMC and BMD were only noted in women receiving 90 mg isoflavones/ day. 12.30 In a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled intervention trial (n=52) the effects of a high and low phytoestrogen diet was examined in postmenopausal women. Participants were assigned to one of threedietary treatment groups: soy, linseed or wheat for a period of 12 weeks and received 45g/ daysupplementation in the form of bread. Mean total isoflavones ingested from soy-based bread wascalculated to be approximately 53 mg/ day. No significant changes in BMD were observed for any dietarytreatment group. However, a significant increase of 5.2% (p=0.03) in BMC was detected at the end of thetreatment period for participants on soy supplementation. No significant changes in BMC were observedfor the linseed and wheat treated groups (Dalais et al , 1998). 12.31 In a 1 year double-blind placebo-controlled intervention trial of postmenopausal women, the effect of treatment with dietary genistein (n=30, 54 mg/ day), HRT (n=30) or and biomarkersof bone formation and resorption were compared (Morabito et al , 2002). Treatment with genistein reduced the excretion of pyridinium cross-links (markers of bone resorption) at 6 months (approximately55%, p /H110210.001) and 12 months (approximately 44%, p /H110210.001) similar to that observed for HRT. Treatment with genistein increased serum osteocalcin and bone specific ALP concentrations (markers of boneformation) at 6 months (approximately 19%, p /H110210.005) and 12 months (approximately 32%, p /H110210.005). However, HRT reduced the concentrations of these markers of bone formation. In addition, after 12months of treatment with genistein or HRT increases in BMD were evident in the femoral neck andlumbar spine (both approximately 3%, p /H110210.001) compared with control.26112.32 Other intervention trials have also investigated the effect of dietary supplementation on biomarkers of bone formation and resorption. In a single group intervention trial of 42 postmenopausal womenconducted by Scheiber et al (2001), subjects consumed approximately 60 mg soy-derived isoflavones/ day for 3 months in addition to their normal diet. Increases in serum osteocalcin (10.2%, p /H11021 0.025), marker of bone formation and decreases in urinary N-telopeptide (13.9%, p /H110210.002), marker of bone resorption, were observed. However, no significant correlation between serum levels ofphytoestrogens and any bone markers (serum skeletal alkaline phosphatase, urinary cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen) was reported. The absence of a placebo control group and the shortduration of this study limits any conclusions that can be attributed to isoflavone intake. 12.33 Dietary soy (90 mg isoflavones/ day) had no effect on BMD or BMC in a 1 year long double-blind placebo- controlled intervention trial of premenopausal women (placebo group n=13; treatment group, n=15)(Anderson et al , 2002). 12.34 Two randomised crossover intervention one in premenopausal (n=14) and one in postmenopausal (n=17) women conducted by Wangen et al (2000) which do not support the hypothesis that dietary isoflavones per se exert beneficial effects on bone turnover in women. These studies consisted of three treatment periods where subjects consumed 8, 65 or 130 mg isoflavone/ day for3 months, separated by washout periods of approximately three weeks. Increased levels of plasmadeoxypyridinoline crosslinks, indicating an increase in bone resorption, were observed in premenopausalwomen. Decreased levels of biomarkers for bone formation correlating with an increase in isoflavoneconsumption were also noted in postmenopausal women. However, these changes were small inmagnitude and were not considered clinically significant. Flaxseed 12.35 A double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial in postmenopausal women showed that flaxseed supplementation did not alter biomarkers of bone metabolism (Lucas et al , 2002). In this trial postmenopausal women (aged /H1102165years) consumed either 40 g/ day ground flaxseed (n=20) or a wheat- based comparative control (n=16) for 3 months. All subjects also received a supplement containingcalcium and Vitamin D, and a 7-day FFQ indicated that women in both groups had similar dietary intakesbefore and after the study. No changes in urinary deoxypyridinoline, helical peptide, IGF and clover extracts 12.36 A double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial showed that a red clover dietary supplement containing 40 mg isoflavones/ day (genistein, daidzein, and biochanin A) urinary pyridinoline crosslinks, in pre- andperimenopausal women (n=97). This effect was not observed in postmenopausal women and nosignificant changes in any other markers, urinary or plasma were noted (Atkinson et al , 2003).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 26212.37 In a randomised, double-blind intervention trial of 46 postmenopausal women, a red clover extract, containing a combination of genistein, daidzein, formononetin and biochanin A and changes in proximalradius and ulna BMD were monitored and compared to the pre-treatment baseline levels. All subjectswent through a single-blind placebo phase (1 month) before receiving either 28.5 mg, 57 mg or 85.5 mgtotal phytoestrogens daily for a 6 month period. This was then followed by a 1 month single-blindwashout phase. Significant increases in BMD, although not dose-dependent, were reported at and 85.5 mg/ day (3.0%, p=0.023). response was noted for the groupreceiving 28.5 mg/ day. However, these results should be treated with caution, as a simultaneous controlgroup was not included and all subjects received 1000 mg calcium supplement throughout the study(Clifton-Bligh et al , 2001). Ipriflavone 12.38 A synthetic isoflavone, ipriflavone (7-isopropoxyisoflavone) has been used as a treatment for inhibiting bone resorption in postmenopausal women (Ohta et al , 1999; Hale et al, 2000, Scheiber & Rebar, 1999). However, the efficacy of ipriflavone has been disputed in a recent 4 year prospective, randomised,double-blind placebo-controlled study (n=240 controls, n=234 cases) which indicated that ipriflavonedoes not prevent bone loss or bone metabolism (Alexandersen et al , 2002). Key points Studies in rodents have consistently shown that phytoestrogens have a beneficial role in preventing bone loss following ovariectomy and that soy isoflavones and other phytoestrogens are effective inconserving bone in rodent models of osteoporosis. Epidemiological studies suggest that intakes of phytoestrogens are associated with higher bone mineral density in populations consuming relatively large amounts of soy. Intervention studies in humans have been limited, relatively short-term and no studies have been performed in men. To date, the beneficial effects of phytoestrogens on bone mineral density and bonemineral content in postmenopausal women have been small but statistically significant and confinedto the lumbar vertebrae with the exception of one study that reported effects in the femoral neck andlumbar vertebrae. In short-term studies it is more likely that an effect will be seen in the spine, ratherthan the hip as the turnover of bone in the hip is slower than that in the spine. Bone status in pre- and peripubertal life is a major determinant of osteoporosis in later life. Short-term intervention studies in adulthood have not addressed the possibility that exposure to phytoestrogensat an earlier life stage or over several life stages (as would have occurred in populations that havetraditionally consumed soy) has conferred some protective change. There is a paucity of long-term human studies investigating phytoestrogen intake in relation to changes in bone mass or markers of bone loss. Large, long-term studies in humans would be required beforethe efficacy of phytoestrogen-containing foods or supplements can be confirmed.263References Alekel DL, St Germain A, Pererson CT, Hanson KB, Stewart JW, Toda T.

Although many risk factors, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, are associated withcardiovascular disease (CVD), the underlying basis for clinical cardiovascular disease is a combination ofatherosclerosis (excessive accumulation of lipids and smooth muscle cells in the artery) and thrombosis(development of fibrinous clots) (COMA, 1994). 13.2 Hormonal status is known to play a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. For example, in women, arterial pressure generally increases after menopause suggesting that ovarian hormones,mainly oestrogen, plays a cardioprotective role. However, a recent large prospective study found thatone form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) which contains oestrogen and progestin increases therisk of CVD (Writing Group for the Women's Health Initiative Investigators, 2002). 13.3 High levels of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) are acknowledged as a primary predictor of heart disease. Lp(a) levels have been shown to be lowered by up to 35% by oestrogen and other sex steroids (Shewmon et al, 1994). Apolipoproteins, such as Apo B and Apo E, also play an important role in the development ofcardiovascular disease. Apolipoproteins are the protein components of lipoproteins, which remain afterthe lipid part has been removed. They play a role in lipid transport and metabolism. 13.4 As well as indirect effects on lipid metabolism, oestrogens are also known to have cardioprotective effects directly on vasculature and arterial compliance (Sudhir et al, 1996; Honore et al, 1997; Nestle et al, 1997). Studies suggest that oestrogen induced cardiovascular protection might be mediated viaincreased synthesis of vascular nitric oxide, a free radical messenger which inhibits platelet aggregation, celladhesion and relaxes the underlying smooth muscle cells (Darblade et al , 2002; Pendaries et al , 2002). 13.5 Mortality rates due to coronary heart disease (CHD) are generally higher in Western populations compared with Eastern (e.g. Chinese and Japanese) populations. In 1986, mortality rates in men andwomen aged 40-69 years were 300 and 100 per 100,000, respectively in America compared with only 50and 15 per 100,000 respectively in Japan (Beaglehole, 1990). 13.6 Reduction of plasma cholesterol can reduce the risk of CHD. A reduction of 1%, on a population basis, can translate to a 2-3% reduction in risk of CHD (Bingham et al, 1998; COMA Annual Report, 1999). This can be achieved by decreasing the amount of saturated fat in the diet. 13.7 Knight & Eden (1996) observed that the incidence of cardiovascular disease was not only lower in Asian compared with Western countries, but also among vegetarians relative to omnivores. Many dietaryfactors are known to play a protective role in cardiovascular disease. However, authors suggested thatphytoestrogens, present in higher concentrations in Asian and vegetarian diets, may also becardioprotective.13. Phytoestrogens and the cardiovascular systemCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 26813.8 Many studies have investigated the cardioprotective effects of dietary soy and isoflavones. However, these have not addressed the possibility that exposure to phytoestrogens at an earlier life stage or overseveral life stages (as would have occurred in populations that have traditionally consumed soy) hasconferred some protective change in these populations. In addition, although there are many risk factorsthat contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (blood pressure, thrombosis,atherosclerosis etc) most studies have investigated the effects of soy and isoflavones on plasma lipidprofiles and plasma lipoprotein concentrations. Phytoestrogen containing foods 13.9 Dietary inclusion of phytoestrogen rich foods, such as soy, linseed and flaxseed has been demonstrated to lower plasma cholesterol levels in humans. Decreases of up to 12.5% have been observed in plasmaLDLC levels after three weeks dietary supplementation with soy and linseed foods, with maximal effectsachieved in individuals classified as hypercholesterolemic (Ridges et al, 2001). Lower plasma lipid profiles seen in Hong Kong Chinese subjects have also been associated with the higher intake of soy and soyfoods in this population (Ho et al , 2000). In a cross-sectional study of postmenopausal women (n=208) the intake of isoflavones calculated from a food frequency questionnaire, was positively associated(p=0.05) with HDL cholesterol (Goodman-Gruen & Kritz-Silverstein, 2001). 13.10 It has been proposed that phytoestrogens are responsible for the cardioprotective properties of soy, but to what extent is unclear (Setchell, 1985; Clarkson et al , 1995). Others have suggested that the protein composition of soy may be partially responsible (Erdman & Fordyce, 1989; Mackey et al , 2000). A meta- analysis of 38 published trials of soy consumption indicated that soy protein intake (47 g/ day) wasassociated with reductions in total cholesterol (9.3%), LDLC (12.9%) and triglycerides (10.5%) (p /H110210.001). However, no significant change in HDLC was observed (Anderson et al , 1995). 13.11 Components other than phytoestrogens may also be responsible for the hypocholesterolaemic effects of these foods. For example, an increase in dietary fibre will increase faecal excretion of cholesterol andbile acids. A population based, case-control study of acute coronary events in middle aged Finnish menreported a significantly lower mean serum enterolactone concentration in cases than in controls (18.2and 23.5 nmol/L, respectively). Men in the highest enterolactone quartile had a 65% lower risk thanthose in the lowest quartile (Vanharanta et al, 1999). The authors noted that a high serum enterolactone concentration might not be associated with CHD per se , but may be a biomarker and reflect a protective diet high in fruit, vegetables, cereals and fibre. 13.12 Phytosterols in soy are structurally similar to cholesterol and although they are poorly absorbed from the intestine, human studies have shown that they can lower levels of serum or plasma total cholesteroland LDLC (Ling & Jones, 1995). 13.13 It has also been suggested that the protective effect of linseed against coronary heart disease might be mediated, at least in part, by its /H9251-linolenic acid and not its lignan content (Allman et al, 1995; Harris, 1997; Pang et al , 1998; Tarpila et al, 2002).269Lipid Profiles Human studies Soy supplementation 13.14 In a cross-sectional cohort study of postmenopausal American women (n=939), dietary intake of phytoestrogens was associated with an improvement in cardiovascular risk profile. Women aged 59(7.5 years were subdivided according to phytoestrogen intake as assessed by food frequencyquestionnaires. The median total daily intake of isoflavones was 0.16 mg/ day, with high and lowconsumers ingesting /H110220.24 and /H110210.1 mg/ day, respectively. The median total daily intake of lignans was 0.58 mg/ day with high and low consumers ingesting /H110220.79 and /H110210.41 mg/ day, respectively. No significant differences were reported in total cholesterol, LDLC or HDLC between high and low dietaryphytoestrogen (isoflavones and lignan) intake groups. However, significant improvements in plasmatriglycerides (p /H110210.05) were seen between the high and low phytoestrogen intake groups (de Kleijn et al, 2002). 13.15 In a cohort study by Somekawa et al (2001), lifetime consumption of dietary isoflavones were not associated with a significant change in the lipid profiles of pre- and postmenopausal East Japanesewomen aged 44-80. The women were assigned to two groups according to years since menopause(n=269 early postmenopausal, /H110215 years since menopause; n=209 late postmenopausal, /H110225 years since menopause). Each group was also subdivided according to isoflavone intake and the subjects reportedweekly, monthly and yearly consumption of soy products. Although the results indicated isoflavoneintake increased slightly with age it was not significant (53.3 mg isoflavone/ day for early and 55.5 mg/ daylate menopausal groups). No significant differences were observed in total serum cholesterol, LDLC,HDLC, triglycerides, Lp(a) and apolipoproteins B (apo B) and apo E between pre- and postmenopausalgroups. 13.16 A randomised, placebo-controlled intervention study in healthy asymptomatic postmenopausal Italian women (aged 36-60) investigated the effects of a soy rich diet on serum lipids and other biomarkers ofcardiovascular health. Subjects in the diet intervention group (n=34) consumed approximately 47 mgisoflavones/ day mainly from soy milk. Although an improvement in total cholesterol:HDLC ratio wasseen in the intervention group, no statistically significant differences in serum total HDLC, LDLC ortriglycerides were observed. However, a high drop out rate in and low compliance to the interventiondiet was reported (Chiechi et al , 2002). 13.17 In a single-group intervention trial by Scheiber et al (2001) no significant changes from baseline in total cholesterol, LDLC, VLDLC, HDLC peroxidation or triglycerides were reported, in postmenopausal women(n=42) following consumption of approximately 60 mg soy derived isoflavones/ day. In this single open-group clinical intervention, women consumed three daily servings of whole soy foods for 3 months. Anincrease was noted in the mean HDLC levels (3.7%) (p /H110210.05) and a decrease (5.5%) (p /H110210.05) in total cholesterol:HDLC ratios. However these effects cannot be attributed to isoflavone intake as the studylacked a placebo control group.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 27013.18 A randomised, double-blind cross-over study (n=21) by Sirtori et al (1999) showed a decrease (approximately 7%, p /H110210.05) in total cholesterol and LDLC associated with soymilk consumption in patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia (mean 8.74 mmol cholesterol/L) when compared a randomised double-blind crossover trial, men (n=34) were fed soy proteinisolate (69 mg isoflavones/ day) or alcohol extracted soy protein isolate (3.4 mg isoflavones/ day) for6 weeks (Urban et al , 2001). Mean plasma cholesterol was reduced (approximately 3%, p=0.036) from baseline after ingestion of intact soy protein isolate. However, no differences in serum lipidconcentrations was seen in a randomised cross-over study of hyperlipidemic individuals (n=25) fed soy(168 mg isoflavones/ day) compared to controls (Jenkins et al , 2000). In a small placebo-controlled intervention study of men (n=10) consuming soymilk (1 L/ day) for 4 weeks, no significant effects onplasma cholesterol or triglycerides were evident (Mitchell & Collins, 1999). 13.19 A randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled intervention trial in normotensive men and postmenopausal women (n=213) receiving 40 g soy protein/ day for 3 months was reported by Teede et al (2001). Individuals received the equivalent of 118 mg isoflavones/ day from the isolated soy protein.Reductions in total cholesterol, LDLC, HDLC, the ratio of LDLC:HDLC and triglycerides were observed.However, overall there was no improvement in vascular function. Potential adverse effects noted werea decline in endothelial function (males only) and an increase in Lp(a) in both males and females. 13.20 The effect of dietary soy protein on Lp(a) in normolipidemic subjects was investigated in a randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial by Meinertz et al (2002). Median plasma Lp(a) concentrations were reduced up to 60% in subjects (6 men and 6 women) following intake of extractedsoy protein (p /H110210.01) and casein diets (p /H110210.001), whereas an intact soy protein diet produced insignificant changes. Consumption of the extracted soy protein diet also lowered triglyceride levels (p/H110210.01). However, overall, none of the dietary treatments resulted in significant changes in plasma total cholesterol or LDLC levels. The authors suggest that the changes noted were due to unusually highintakes of soy and casein protein (mean 96 and 170 g/ day for men and women, respectively) whichexceeded what is normally consumed in solid-food diets. 13.21 A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial showed soy protein consumption led to significant decreases in non-HDLC (Baum et al , 1998; Potter et al Hypercholesterolaemic, postmenopausal women (n=66), maintained on a low-fat-low-cholesterol diet, received 40 gprotein/ day from either non-fat dry milk, isolated soy protein containing 1.39 mg isoflavones/g orisolated soy protein containing 2.25 mg isoflavones/g, for 6 months. Significant increases in HDLC(p/H110210.05) and mononuclear cell LDL receptor mRNA (p /H110210.05) were seen in both isolated soy protein groups (p /H110210.05), but not in the non-fat dry milk group. 13.22 In a r andomised, double-blind placebo-controlled, intervention trial of male and female hypercholesterolemic patients (n=156), Crouse et al (1999) reported a dose-related reduction of plasma total cholesterol (4%, p=0.04) and LDLC (6%, p=0.01) following soy supplementation. Subjects consumed25 g of soy protein isolate treated to provide either 3, 27, 37 or 62 mg isoflavones/ day for 9 weeks.Reductions in total cholesterol and LDLC were significant only at the top dose (62 mg isoflavones)relative to casein controls. No changes in triglyceride concentrations or HDLC were noted.27113.23 A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial in Finnish adults demonstrated significant decreases in plasma total cholesterol (8.3%, p=0.049) and LDLC (13.2%, p=0.014) concentrationscompared with a placebo group following treatment with isolated soy protein. A total of 60hypercholesterolaemic men (aged 45-70years) and women (postmenopausal aged 45-70years) wererecruited in this study. The treatment group (n=30) received a liquid supplement of 52 g isolated soyprotein (192 mg isoflavones/ day for 6 weeks). However, small but significant decreases in totalcholesterol (5.1%) and LDLC (8%) concentrations were also noted in the placebo groups. The onset ofconcentration change in cholesterol levels was more rapid in the treatment compared with the placebogroup and all subjects returned to pre-study levels during the 4 week post-treatment wash-out period(Puska et al , 2002). 13.24 In an intervention trial in hypercholesterolemic male subjects (n=20), a significant improvement in plasma lipid profiles was seen following a soy protein rich diet compared with baseline measurements. Subjectshad 60% animal source proteins replaced by soy protein for 6 weeks. Total plasma cholesterol (p/H110210.001), LDLC (p /H110210.001), apo B (p /H110210.039), and triglyceride (p /H110210.001), levels were decreased (Yildirir et al , 2001). 13.25 In a randomised cross-over trial, normocholesterolemic premenopausal women (n=13) showed reductions in LDLC (up to 10%, p /H110210.05) when compared to pre-treatment baseline levels. Subjects were maintained on soy diets (approximately 130 mg isoflavone/ day) for a total of 3 menstrual cycles.Although isoflavone consumption did not significantly affect total cholesterol or HDLC levels, a loweringin the ratios of total cholesterol:HDLC (10.2%, p /H110210.005) and LDLC:HDLC (13.8%, p 2000). 13.26 In a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled, cross-over trial significant declines in total cholesterol (6% lower) and LDLC (7% lower) were also observed in non-hypercholesterolaemic, non-hypertensive, perimenopausal women (n=51) when fed a soy diet compared with an isocaloriccarbohydrate placebo diet. The subjects consumed 20 g of soy protein (containing 34 mg totalphytoestrogens), as either a single daily dose or split into two daily doses, for 6 weeks. No significanteffects on triglycerides or HDLC were observed (Washburn et al , 1999). 13.27 In a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled, intervention trial, no improvement in plasma lipids or lipoproteins that could be attributed to dietary soy protein was noted in perimenopausal women (n=21).Normocholesterolemic and mildly hypercholesterolemic women received 40g soy protein / day for 24weeks in the form of a muffin containing either isoflavone/ day (n=24), 4.4mg isoflavone/ or whey et 13.28 In a randomised double-blind cross-over trial, hypercholersterolaemic postmenopausal women were fed soy milk (80 mg isoflavones/ day, n=31), alcohol extracted soy (3 mg isoflavones/ day, n=33) or cows milk(2 mg isoflavones/ day, n=30) for 12 weeks (Gardener et al , 2001). Reductions (not statistically significant) in LDL-cholesterol were reported in both soy fed groups compared to the group fed cows milk. Therewere no changes in blood HDL-cholesterol or triglyceride concentrations between treatment groups.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 27213.29 In a randomised cross-over trial of post menopausal women (n=18), changes in plasma LDL-cholesterol (6.5% reduction, p=0.02) were seen following consumption of an isolated soy protein drinksupplemented with 7.1, 65, and 132 mg isoflavones. The soy drink containing 63 g of protein, wasconsumed daily for 13 weeks and each treatment was separated by a 26-day washout period. There wereno significant changes in any of the other plasma lipids or lipoprotein concentrations plasma totalcholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, Apo B or Lp(a) (Wangen et al , 2001). 13.30 This is in agreement with a randomised, placebo controlled intervention trial in healthy men (n=20) which showed no changes in plasma total cholesterol or HDLC following consumption of a soy proteinisolate beverage powder (60 g/ day for 28 days). The authors suggest this was because subjects werenormocholesterolemic at start of the study (Gooderham et al , 1996). 13.31 It has also been suggested that a component of soy protein may affect the regulation of peripheral LDL receptors. This has been demonstrated by the effect of dietary soy protein in type IIhypocholesterolaemic patients with differing apo E genotypes. In apo E3 and E4 genotype patients,peripheral LDL receptors are fully functional but receptor activity is suppressed. When these patientssupplemented their diet with soy protein, plasma cholesterol levels were significantly lowered, possiblydue to soy protein activation of LDL receptors. Patients with apo E2 genotype, characterised by defectivebinding to LDL receptors, were found to respond poorly to dietary soy supplementation and nosignificant effect on plasma cholesterol levels was observed (Gaddi et al , 1991; Sirtori and Lovati, 2001). 13.32 In contrast, there was no significant correlation between apo E3 and E4 genotypes and the lipid lowering effects of isolated soy protein in a study by Vigna et al (2000). However, there was a significant reduction in apo B levels in the two apo E2 genotype subjects treated with isolated soy protein when E2 genotype placebos (p=0.05). In 53.3 ( 3.3.years), consumed 60g isolated soy protein/ day for 12 weeks. Significantreductions in total cholesterol and LDLC concentrations were seen in both placebo and treatmentgroups, but only the treatment group demonstrated a significant reduction in apo B (6% lower) andLDLC:HDLC ratios (8% lower).

(continued)Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 276Isoflavone supplementation 13.33 Efforts have been made to determine if the isoflavones in soy are hypocholesterolemic agents. Anderson et al (1995) suggested that isoflavones may contribute up to 70% of the hypolipidemic effect of soy. This was based on experiments conducted in rhesus monkeys fed soy isolates with and without isoflavones(Anthony et al , 1996). However, clinical findings with regard to isoflavones, have been inconsistent and inconclusive (see Table 13.1). 13.34 A randomised double-blind, placebo controlled study by Han et al (2002) demonstrated a significant decrease in total cholesterol and LDLC in menopausal women (n=80) receiving 100 mg isoflavones/ dayfor a period of 16 weeks compared with baseline (p /H110210.001) and the placebo group (p /H110210.01). However, no changes in HDLC and triglyceride levels were observed. 13.35 A randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled, intervention study in 46 healthy middle-aged men and 13 postmenopausal women (not on HRT) was carried out by Hodgson et al (1998). Diet was supplemented daily with tablets containing 55 mg of isoflavones (mainly as genistein). Isoflavone supplements weretaken over an 8 week period, but no post-intervention differences in either serum lipid or Lp(a) levelswere observed. 13.36 A randomised, intervention study in 20 healthy postmenopausal women (50-70 years) showed no improvement in any plasma lipid profiles or lipoprotein concentrations.Subjects received a supplement containing 80 mg isoflavone/ day for 8 weeks (Simons et al , 2000). 13.37 Furthermore, data from a relatively short-term (5 or 10 week) placebo-controlled cross-over study found no change in plasma lipids in 21 menopausal and perimenopausal women supplemented daily with 80 mgisoflavones, containing 45 (Nestel et al, 1999; 1997). 13.38 Isoflavone supplementation for 24 weeks also had no effect on serum lipid profiles in elderly (mean age 69), moderately hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women (Dewell et al, 2002). In this randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, elderly postmenopausal women, not either a 150mg isoflavone supplement/ day (n=20) or a placebo (n=16). No changes in total triacylglycerol, totalcholesterol, or HDLC were observed after 8 weeks treatment. Total triacylglycerol and cholesterolremained unchanged at 24 weeks. 13.39 In a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 23 healthy postmenopausal Japanese women receiving isoflavone supplementation (62 mg isoflavone/ day, mainly as daidzin) for 4 weeks also showedno significant changes in blood serum lipids. Total serum cholesterol and LDLC decreased significantly(p/H110210.05) from baseline levels in the treatment groups, but this decrease was not significant when compared to the placebo group (Uesugi et al , 2002). 13.40 A randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, investigated the effects of a red clover isoflavone supplement on the lipid profiles in postmenopausal Australian women (n=93). Subjects (aged 58 \u00b17.3 years) with mild to moderate hypercholesterolaemia consumed a low isoflavone diet for two weeks277before starting the 12 week continuous treatment period. Purified extract of red clover was consumed in the form of a tablet containing approximately 40 mg total isoflavones (26 mg biochanin A, 16 mgformononetin, 1 mg genistein, and 0.5 mg daidzein). Subjects were given ascending doses of isoflavonesof 0, 40 mg (one tablet), and 80 mg (two tablets) total isoflavones/ day, with each dosing period lastingthree weeks. Urinary excretion of isoflavones was changes in totalplasma cholesterol, HDLC, LDLC or triglyceride levels were noted (Howes et al 2000). Lignans 13.41 Few studies have been conducted to determine if lignans found in flaxseed or cereals are hypocholesterolemic agents. In a randomised, cross-over placebo-controlled trial, reductions in totalplasma cholesterol, LDLC, apo B and Lp(a), but no changes in lipoprotein ratios, were observed in 29hyperlipidemic patients fed a flaxseed-fibre supplemented diet (Jenkins et al, 1999). In this trial, 22 men and 7 postmenopausal women, consumed 20 g fibre/ day from flaxseed (approximately 50 g partiallydefatted flaxseed/ day) for three weeks and results were compared with a control group fed a wheat-bran diet. Animal studies 13.42 Studies in ovariectomised cynomolgus monkeys have demonstrated that addition of soy protein to oestrogen replacement therapy improves clinical indicators related to cardiovascular disease, such asarterial dilatation and plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations (Wagner et al , 1997; Williams et al , 2001). However, the active component of soy protein has yet to be identified, as results from animalstudies have yielded conflicting results. 13.43 Anthony et al (1997) showed that a diet containing intact soy (n=27) was the most effective, and a diet containing casein (n=27), the least effective in improving LDLC and HDLC profiles, in young malecynomolgus monkeys fed an atherogenic diet. Diets containing alcohol-extracted soy (i.e. isoflavonesremoved) had an intermediate effect, but did not differ significantly from the casein group. It was notpossible to ascertain from the study whether any beneficial effects of the diet containing alcohol-extracted soy were due to the soy protein itself or residual traces of isoflavones. In addition, Nogowskiet al (1998) reported that dietary supplementation with genistein (up to 0.1%), resulted in significant reductions of serum and muscle triglycerides, increases in free fatty acids and diminished plasma andincreased hepatic cholesterol in ovariectomised rats. 13.44 In a study by Clarkson et al (2001), ovariectomised cynomolgus monkeys (n=189) were fed an isocaloric atherogenic diet for 26 months followed by a further 36 month treatment period. The control group(n=57) received alcohol washed soy protein. The treatment groups received intact soy protein (n=60) orconjugated equine oestrogens (n=62). Both the intact soy treatment groupsshowed significant reductions in LDLC and VLDLC compared with control groups. There were nosignificant differences among the groups for Lp(a) concentrations. Generally animals treated with intactsoy showed significant improvements in plasma lipids compared with those fed alcohol washed soy.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 27813.45 In contrast, a study in ovariectomised cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated that although a diet consisting of intact soy protein improved the lipid and lipoprotein profile, a diet consisting of semi-purified extract of soy rich in isoflavones added to casein-lactalbumin protein did not (Greaves et al , 1999). Other authors have suggested that a decrease in intestinal cholesterol absorption mediated by soyprotein may be responsible for the lipid lowering effects of soy (Nagata et al, 1982; Potter 1998). However, results from this study could not be explained by differences in absorption of isoflavones from the twodiets. 13.46 A study in gerbils suggested that consumption of an isoflavone containing extract from soy did not contribute to the hypocholesterolemic effect of alcohol-extracted soy. However, isoflavone containingextract from soy may influence lipid metabolism by altering expression for lipid-related genes, illustratedby the down regulation of (Touvar-Palacio et al , 1998). 13.47 The effects of different sources of protein and a soyflour extract on serum cholesterol levels in rats (n=24) and hamsters (n=50) was investigated by Balmir et al (1996). The study found that serum total cholesterol and LDLC were decreased in both rats and hamsters fed 200 g soy-protein/kg bw comparedwith those fed a casein-protein. Addition extract (360 mg extract/kgprotein) to casein diets also resulted in lowering of LDLC concentration compared with casein alone, inboth rats and hamsters. 13.48 This is in agreement with the study by Potter et al (1996), which demonstrated that serum total cholesterol was lowered in hamsters, following consumption of 250 g soy protein/kg proteinconcentrate or isolated soy protein when compared to casein protein fed hamsters. However, serumHDLC and LDLC, as well as HDL/LDL ratios were unaffected by dietary treatment. 13.49 Alexandersen et al (2001) reported soy diet (6.5 mg isoflavone/ day) had significant cholesterol-lowering effects in ovariectomised rabbits. This anti-atherogenic effect was comparable to that produced byoestradiol supplementation (4 mg/ day), which produced serum concentrations similar to those seen inpostmenopausal women on HRT. 13.50 The hypocholesterolemic and anti-atherogenic properties of flaxseed have also been attributed to its lignan constituents (Prasad et al , 1998; 1999). diglucoside, was found to reduce hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis in rabbits when added to a high-cholesterol diet. Thereduction was associated with decreased serum total cholesterol, LDLC and an increase in HDLC. Blood pressure 13.51 Few studies have investigated the effect of soy or phytoestrogens on blood pressure and arterial compliance. However, reductions in systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure (BP) was evident(p/H110210.05) in normotensive men and postmenopausal women following consumption of 40 g soy protein/ day (118 mg isoflavones/ day) for 12 weeks (Teede et al, 2001).27913.52 Consumption of 60 g isolated soy protein/ day (containing 76 mg isoflavones) for 12 weeks decreased (p=0.01) systolic blood pressure in postmenopausal women (Vigna et al , 2000). 13.53 A significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure was observed in healthy peri-menopausal women consuming a twice-daily soy diet (20g soy protein/ day containing 34 mg isoflavones) when comparedwith the placebo diet for 6 weeks (Washburn et al, 1999). 13.54 Yildirir et al (2001) demonstrated that endothelial function as measured by flow mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, was improved following substitution of 60% animal protein in diet with soy proteinin hypercholesterolemic male subjects (n=20). 13.55 Rivas et al (2002) showed that ingestion of soy milk (143 mg isoflavones/ day) reduced systolic blood pressure (by 17 mmHg, p /H110210.0001) and diastolic blood pressure (by 12.2 mmHg), p /H110210.0001) compared with cows milk in a 3 month double-blind randomised trial of men and women (n=40) with mild tomoderate hypertension. 13.56 Clinical studies have been unable to attribute the anti-hypertensive effects of soy to phytoestrogen content. In a randomised double-blind, placebo controlled study by Han et al (2002), supplementation of the diet with 100 mg isoflavones/ day for a period of 16 weeks had no effects on blood pressure inmenopausal women (n=80). Healthy postmenopausal women, with evidence of endothelial dysfunctionalso showed no changes in blood pressure or improvement in flow-mediated endothelium dilatationafter supplementation of 80 mg soy isoflavones/ day 8 weeks (Simons et al , 2000). 13.57 Nestel et al (1997; 1999) did show a significant improvement (up to 26%, p /H110210.001) in systemic arterial compliance when compared with placebo controls in perimenopausal women consuming 80 mgisoflavones/ day. However, these effects were noted in the absence of any affect on arterial pressure. 13.58 In a r andomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial postmenopausal (n=60), supplementation genistein (54 mg/ day) improved flow-mediated endothelialvasodilation (p /H110210.01) compared with placebo (Squadrito et al , 2002). Measurement of plasma nitric oxide and endothelin-1 concentrations suggested this could be a result of increased nitric oxide toendothelin ratios. 13.59 In animal studies, consumption of a soy based diet for 5 weeks attenuated the development of hypertension when compared to casein based diets in both male and female spontaneouslyhypertensive rats (Nevala et al, 2000). 13.60 The mechanism of anti-hypertensive effects of soy is unclear although the production of vascular nitric oxide is thought to play a role. Karamsetty et al (2001) demonstrated that isoflavones act like oestrogen in mediating nitric oxide release in isolated pulmonary rat arteries. Enhanced arterial relaxation was seenin chronically hypoxic rats on treatment with genistein (30 /H9262M) and daidzein (30 /H9262M). No response was seen in normoxic rats.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 28013.61 In animal studies, blockade of autonomic function, removed the anti-hypertensive effects of a diet consisting of 19% whole soy meal (Martin et al, 2001). Although isoflavone intake was not measured, rats were reported to have plasma genistein concentrations of 0.9-1.37 \u00b5M. Dietary phytoestrogens were also found to have a beneficial role in NaCl-induced hypertensive ovariectomised rats indicating that thesympathetic nervous system also plays a role in the anti-hypertensive effects of dietary soy (Fang et al , 2001). Thrombosis 13.62 Thrombosis is a risk factor of cardiovascular disease. Few studies have investigated the effects of phytoestrogens on the formation of fibrinous clots, biochemical mechanismsinvolved in thrombi formation. 13.63 In a study by Dent et al (2001), no changes in coagulation and fibrinolytic factors such as fibrinogen, and factor VII antigen relating to soy protein intake were noted in perimenopausal womenwhen compared to a control group fed whey protein. Normocholesterolemic and mildlyhypercholesterolemic women received 40g soy protein/ day for 24 weeks in the form of a muffincontaining either 4.4 or 80.4 mg isoflavone/ day. 13.64 No significant differences in platelet aggregation were seen in platelet rich plasma taken from men (n=20) receiving a soy protein isolate beverage (60 g soy protein isolate powder) for 4 weeks compared to caseincontrols (Gooderham et al , 1996). 13.65 Platelet protein-tyrosine (PTK) pathways and isoflavones are known to be PTK inhibitors (see Chapter 7). A number of in vitro studies have demonstrated genistein can effect human and rat platelet function, by blocking PTK pathways (Kuruvilla and platelet aggregation may be amechanism by which isoflavones exert their anti-atherogenic effects. 13.66 In addition, a study suggests that the effects of genistein on human platelet function may be due to thromboxane receptor antagonism rather than inhibition of tyrosine kinase (McNicol, 1993). In vitro studies have shown that genistein blocks thrombin-induced aggregation of human platelet in a dosedependent manner. Increases in intracellular calcium concentrations induced by thrombin were alsoinhibited by genistein (Asahi et al , 1992). 13.67 There are no studies to date on lignans and the development of thrombosis. Atherosclerosis 13.68 Atherosclerosis may also be a factor in the development of cardiovascular disease. Atheromatous plaques are formed by the migration of smooth muscle cells into the artery lumen and deposits ofcirculating cholesterol.28113.69 In a study by Kirk et al (1998), soy supplemented diets (360 mg isoflavones/kg diet) reduced atherosclerosis in wildtype but not LDL receptor null mice compared with mice fed alcohol washed soy(30 mg isoflavones/kg diet) suggesting that isoflavones may act by a LDL receptor-mediated mechanismto protect against atherosclerosis. However, Adams et al (2002) used two genetically engineered mouse models of atherosclerosis to investigate the mechanism of soy protein isolate inhibition onatherosclerosis. In the first mouse model, which was devoid of LDL receptors and over produced apo B(LDL-/-), atherosclerosis was inhibited by both intact and alcohol washed (isoflavones removed) soyprotein. In the second experimental model, mice had normal complement of LDL receptors but did notproduce apo E (apo E-/-). Apo E is required to ensure efficient clearance of plasma lipoproteins. Therewas no association between soy consumption and plasma lipids and the anti-atherosclerotic effectsseen in LDL-/- despite of an increase in plasma LDLC. Atherosclerosis was also reduced in the apo E -/-mice but to a lesser extent. These results suggest the anti-atherosclerotic effect of soy protein isolatedoes not require the presence of LDL receptors and is independent of plasma lipid levels. 13.70 Two primate studies suggest that dietary soy may lower atherosclerosis. Clarkson et al (2001) reported a non-significant lowering of the extent carotid and artery atherosclerosis in ovariectomised cynomolgusmonkeys following a 36 month treatment with dietary soy compared with alcohol washed dietary soy.In a study by Anthony et al (1997), male cynomolgus monkeys with atherosclerosis were fed intact soy (1500 mg isoflavones/kg diet), alcohol washed soy (179 mg isoflavones/kg diet) or caesin supplementeddiets. Atherosclerosis was significantly reduced in both groups of monkeys fed soy compared withcaesin, however the effect was greater in those animals fed intact soy. 13.71 The anti-atherogenic properties of isoflavones without soy protein were investigated in cholesterol-fed rabbits by Yamakoshi et al (2000). An isoflavone-rich extract containing either 0, 3.3 or 10 g isoflavones/kg diet was fed to male rabbits for 8 weeks. A dose-dependent reduction in atheroscleroticlesions in the aorta was noted, in the absence of any change in plasma lipid concentrations.Immunohistochemical analysis revealed inhibition of LDL oxidation. The authors suggest the anti-oxidative activity of isoflavone metabolites may be the mechanism by which isoflavones exert their anti-atherogenic effect. A number of studies reviewed in Chapter 7 also show dietary soy can inhibit LDLoxidation. 13.72 The migration of smooth muscle requires PTK activity. Studies by Shimokado et al (1994; 1995) have demonstrated that genistein can inhibit PTK and can also inhibit the chemotaxis of rat aortic smoothmuscle cells and cytoskeletal reorganisation in vitro . In an in vitro study, genistein inhibited proliferation and migration of rat smooth muscle cells (Makela et al , 1999). Genistein has also been demonstrated to inhibit platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) activity. PDGF plays a role in the proliferation of smoothmuscle cells and cytoskeletal reorganisation (Fujio et al , 1993). 13.73 A single human study has examined the effects of phytoestrogens on atherosclerosis (van der Schouw, 2002). This prospective study reported an association between aortic stiffness and increased isoflavoneintake (p=0.02) and lignans (p=0.03) (n=180) that had been postmenopausal for 20-30 years.The association was less pronounced in women that had been postmenopausal for /H1102120 years. The authors suggest that dietary phytoestrogens may have a protective effect on the risk of atherosclerosis.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 282U.S. Food and Drug Administration consideration of soy and CHD 13.74 The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 initially refused a health claim application based on an association between dietary soy with a specified concentration of isoflavones and areduction of heart disease risk. This was because the FDA concluded there was insufficient evidence tosuggest a specific contribution of isoflavones to the cardioprotective effects of soy. However, the FDAdid permit the application when the health claim was changed to associate soy protein with thereduction of heart disease. Food producers are now able to use the following health claim, or areasonable variation, on their products in the US (FDA, 1999): 'Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include 25 grams of soy protein a day may reduce the risk of heart disease. One serving of (name of food) provides (insert amount) grams of soy protein ' 13 13.75 To qualify to use this claim the foods must contain the following per serving: 6.25 g of soy protein low fat (less than 3 g) low saturated fat (less than 1 g) low cholesterol (less than 20 mg) Sodium value of less than 480 mg for individual foods Sodium value less than 720 mg if considered a main dish Sodium value less than 960 mg if considered a meal Key Points There are many risk factors which contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases (e.g. hypertension, thrombosis, atherosclerosis) reflecting a variety of mechanisms underlying thecondition. Not all of these factors are directly affected by diet. The similarity of phytoestrogens to oestrogens, which have hypocholesterolaemic effects, and the lower cardiovascular disease mortality rates in populations consuming soy have prompted thesuggestion that phytoestrogens are protective against cardiovascular disease. There is evidence from epidemiological studies and intervention trials that diets containing soy or soy protein isolates can have a hypocholesterolaemic effect in humans. There is some evidence thatflaxseed (which is rich in lignans) also has a hypocholesterolaemic effect. 13In 2002, the UK Joint Health Claims Initiative recommended a similar health claim for soy (see website: www.jhci.co.uk).283 Intervention studies conducted in healthy and hypercholesterolemic subjects, with pure isoflavones have produced inconsistent results. Therefore it is not possible to attribute the hypocholesterolaemiceffect of soy to its phytoestrogen content. The effects of phytoestrogens on other factors important in the risk of cardiovascular disease have not been extensively investigated. Studies measuring the effects of soy or purified isoflavones suggestthat soy may reduce blood pressure but this effect cannot be attributed to the isoflavone content.Human studies have shown dietary soy has no effect on thrombosis. A single human study suggeststhat dietary phytoestrogens may have a beneficial effect on one parameter of atherosclerosis. Data obtained from animal studies suggest isoflavones either play no role or are only partly involved in the soy-associated lowering of plasma total cholesterol and/ or low density:high density cholesterolratio. Animal studies suggest that soy has a beneficial effect on atherosclerosis but it is not possible toattribute this effect to the isoflavone content. Short term intervention studies in adulthood have not addressed the possibility that exposure to phytoestrogens at an earlier life stage or over several life stages (as would have occurred inpopulations that have traditionally consumed soy) has conferred some protective change in thesepopulations.

Clin Cardiol. 2001, 24:711-716.293Introduction 14.1 There is much interest in the possible hormonal effects of phytoestrogens in both men and women. The majority of studies conducted in women have examined the ability of phytoestrogens to alleviatemenopausal symptoms. While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is recommended for womenexperiencing menopausal symptoms, there remains some concern that HRT increases the risk of breastcancer and cardiovascular disease (Writing Group for the Women's Health Initiative Investigators, 2002) 14. As a result of these concerns, investigations into natural alternatives to HRT such as phytoestrogens haveattracted considerable attention. 14.2 It has been observed that the rate of breast cancer is relatively lower in women from some populations in Asia e.g. Japanese and Chinese compared with Western populations leading to suggestions of apossible association with increased dietary intakes of phytoestrogens. Studies in premenopausal womenhave thus focused on the potential cancer protective effects of phytoestrogens. Markers of \"protective\"effects include increased menstrual cycle length and increased sex hormone binding globulin levels,which are thought to reduce the risk of breast cancer by decreasing an individual's lifetime exposure toendogenous oestrogens (see Chapter 15). 14.3 In men, increased phytoestrogen consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer (see Chapter 15). However, there has also been some speculation that phytoestrogens mayadversely affect the fertility of men by reducing testosterone levels and sperm counts (see Chapter 9). 14.4 This chapter reviews the data from human trials. The data from studies in animals is reviewed in Chapter 9. Hormonal effects in peri- and postmenopausal women 14.5 The menopause is associated with ovarian failure, an increased serum concentration of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and reduced levels of oestradiol. The perimenopausal transition, whichoccurs 1-5 years prior to the menopause, is characterised by irregularities in the menstrual cycle followedby shortening in cycle length and subsequent intermittent skipping of cycles. Throughout this time, thereare fluctuations in oestrogen levels and women experience a number of different symptoms includinghot flushes, depression, vaginal dryness and muscle/joint aches. The pathophysiology of the hot flushis uncertain but it appears that reduced oestrogen concentrations may be the primary trigger. In mostWestern countries, 80% of menopausal women experience hot flushes. In almost one-third of thesewomen, hot flushes are frequent, severe and may be accompanied by sensations of tenseness, tiredness,irritability, headaches and muscle and/ or joint pain. In contrast to other symptoms that are mainlyexperienced in the peri-menopausal period, vaginal dryness is also a problem for approximately 50% ofwomen after the menopause occurs (Eden, 1998).14. Phytoestrogen modulation of endogenous hormones in humans 14Some forms of HRT contain a combination of oestrogens and progestin and thus the risk factors identified for these forms of HRT may not be the same as those when only oestrogen is administered.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 29414.6 Women in different populations report the symptoms of the menopause differently. Hot flushes and sweating seem to be the most commonly reported symptoms, however their prevalence is lower amongwomen in South East Asian populations i.e. Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines,Singapore and Taiwan when compared with their Western counterparts. In some countries, such asMalaysia, the predominant symptom reported is headache. It has been suggested that these differencesmay be due to cultural and dietary factors, particularly with regard to phytoestrogen intake (Eden, 1998). 14.7 A study demonstrated that dietary phytoestrogens produced mild oestrogenic effects in postmenopausal women (Wilcox et al, 1990). It showed that in comparison with baseline measurements, dietary supplementation with soy flour, linseed or red clover sprouts in postmenopausal women (n=25),each for 2 weeks, significantly improved vaginal cytology (p /H110210.01). An increase in vaginal maturation index, a sensitive measure of oestrogenicity, was also observed following the soy flour (p /H110210.05) and linseed (p /H110210.02) diets but not the red clover sprouts. A cumulative reduction in FSH (p /H110210.05), but not lutenising hormone (LH), was also noted during 6 weeks. However, the results of this study are difficultto interpret, as no control group was included. A randomised, placebo-controlled study by Baird et al (1995) assessing the oestrogenic effects of a high soy diet (165 mg total isoflavones/ day) inpostmenopausal women (n=97) reported a small non-significant increase in the percentage of vaginalsuperficial cells after 4 weeks. There was no effect on any of the other parameters measured (serum LH,FSH and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)). 14.8 More recently, other studies have also suggested that phytoestrogens produce weak hormonal effects in postmenopausal women. A randomised crossover study by Duncan et al (1999a) assessed the effects of a soy protein containing different levels of isoflavones on plasma hormone levelsin postmenopausal women (n=18). The high isoflavone diet reduced the levels of oestrone sulfate (p/H110210.05) and there was a trend towards reduced levels of oestrone and oestradiol with the high isoflavone diet. There was no effect on vaginal cytology or endometrial thickness. A randomisedcrossover trial by Xu et al (2000) investigated the effect of soy on the oxidative metabolism of oestradiol. The study demonstrated an increase in the ratio of 2-hydroxyoestrone:16 /H9251-hydroxyoestrone (p/H110210.05) in postmenopausal women (n=18) receiving 7, 65 or 132 mg/ day total isoflavones for approximately 93 days. 14.9 A cross-sectional study in postmenopausal (n=456, aged (55 years) and premenopausal (n=636 aged 20-44 years) women participating in the UK arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancerand Nutrition (EPIC) examined the effect of soymilk consumption on plasma sex hormoneconcentrations (Verkasalo, et al . 2001). Participants completed a FFQ to determine the frequency of soy consumption. Soymilk consumption was not significantly associated with any change in blood sexhormone concentrations in either post- or premenopausal women. 14.10 Nicholls et al (2002) investigated the effects of dietary phytoestrogens on gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulated hormone levels in premenopausal (n=5) and postmenopausal women (n=7)fed 50 g textured soy protein (60 mg total isoflavones). In both pre- and postmenopausal women, short295term soy consumption did not effect serum hormone or gonadotrophin concentrations after GnRH administration. Increased LH secretion was observed in postmenopausal women after cessation of soyconsumption. Studies showing beneficial effects of phytoestrogens on the menopause (see Table 14.1) 14.11 Japanese women (n=1106) aged between 35-54 years (all were premenopausal at the start of the study) were studied in 6 year prospective study on the effect of soy intake on hot flushes (Nagata et al, 2001a). A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was completed at the start of the study period and women werequestioned on the occurrence of hot flushes at the end of the study period. Women (n=101) reportedmoderate or severe hot flushes. The incidence of hot flushes was inversely associated with consumptionof soy products in terms of total soy product intake (OR= 0.47, (n=190) were studied in a multicentre, prospective non- randomised trial of the effects of an isoflavones dietary supplement on menopausal symptoms (Albertet al , 2002). Each subject received 35 mg isoflavones/ day over four months and menopausal symptoms including sleep disorder, anxiety, depression, vaginal dryness, loss of libido and bone pain were assessed.Incidence of hot flushes were decreased in 81% of participants (p /H110210.05). All the other parameters studied also showed a statistically significant decrease. The study did not include a placebo group. 14.13 A study by Somekawa et al (2001) evaluated the effect of dietary isoflavones on menopausal symptoms of women in Japan. The women were assigned to two groups according to years since menopause (n=269early postmenopausal, /H110215 years since menopause; n=209 late postmenopausal, /H110225 years since menopause). Each group was also subdivided according to isoflavone intake. Subjects reported weekly,monthly and yearly consumption of soy products. Menopausal symptom scores of palpitations andbackache or aching joints were lower in early postmenopausal women with a higher isoflavone intake(p/H110210.05). The severity of other menopausal symptoms tended to be less in the higher intake group although the differences were not significant. No differences in menopausal symptoms were reportedbetween women in the late postmenopausal group. 14.14 Nagata et al (2001a) investigated the effect of soy products and isoflavone intake on the incidence of hot flushes in a cohort of Japanese women (n=1106, aged 35-54). Consumption of soy products and isoflavoneintake was assessed by means of a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Followingadjustment for confounding factors the study suggested that hot flushes were inversely associated withconsumption of soy products both in terms of total soy product intake (p=0.005 for the highest tertileversus the lowest tertile) and isoflavone intake (p=0.002 for the highest tertile versus the lowest tertile). 14.15 A randomised, placebo controlled study by Brzezinski et al (1997) reported that following 12 weeks of intervention with a soy and flaxseed rich diet, both peri- and postmenopausal women (n=145)experienced a reduction in the severity of hot flushes (p=0.004) and vaginal dryness (p=0.005). Similarly,Albertazzi et al (1998, 1999) reported that following 12 weeks of supplementation with 60 g soy proteinCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 296(76 mg isoflavone aglucone/ day), postmenopausal women (n=104) experienced a reduction (p /H110210.01) in moderate to severe hot flushes. There was no difference in vaginal maturation index. In addition, adouble-blind, cross-over study in perimenopausal women (n=51) found that women consuming a soyprotein isolate (34 mg isoflavones) twice daily showed improvements in the severity of menopausalsymptoms and hypoestrogenic symptoms compared with those receiving the supplement once daily(Washburn et al , 1999). 14.16 A double-blind randomised in postmenopausal women (n=177) given a soy isoflavone supplement (50 mg total isoflavones/ day) for 12 weeks found a reduction in hot flush severitywith the soy supplement (p=0.01) compared to the placebo. There was no change in endometrialthickness nor vaginal maturation index or vaginal pH with either treatment (Upmalis et al , 2000). Similar results were obtained in a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in postmenopausal women(n=39) receiving 400 mg/ day soy extract (50 mg total isoflavones/ day) by Scambia et al (2000). Women receiving soy had a reduction in the number of hot flushes (p /H110210.01) and the severity of hot flushes and night sweats (p /H110210.001). There were no oestrogenic changes in vaginal cytology, endometrial thickness or uterine artery pulsatility index. 14.17 In a double-blind placebo controlled study, Brazilian postmenopausal women (aged 45-55 years) were randomly assigned to daily treatments of an isoflavone supplement (33.3 mg isoflavones, n=40) orplacebo (n=40) (Han et al , 2002). Menopausal symptoms were examined at baseline and after 4 months of treatment. Isoflavone treatment significantly decreased menopausal symptoms (p /H110210.01) versus control as measured by the Menopausal Kupperman Index. 14.18 Van der Weijer & Barentsen (2002) reported a 44% reduction (p /H110210.01) in the incidence of hot flushes in a double blind placebo controlled trial of postmenopausal women (n=30) ingesting isoflavones (80 mg/ day) for 12 weeks. The Green climacteric scale score also decreased (13%) in the isoflavonetreatment group compared with controls. The researchers included a 4 week blind placebo phase priorto the treatment phase to eliminate the placebo response. 14.19 In a study by Jeri (2002), a 48% reduction (p /H110210.001) in hot flushes was found in a placebo-controlled double blind study of postmenopausal Peruvian women (n=30) ingesting isoflavones (40 mg/ day)for 16 weeks. Studies failing to show an effect of phytoestrogens on the menopause (see table 14.2) 14.20Three cross-sectional studies by Nagata et al (1998; 1999; 2000b) report that dietary factors such as soy may have an effect of menopausal symptoms. The association between frequency and severity of hotflashes and soy intake was investigated in Japanese postmenopausal women (n=20, aged 40-59 years).Diet was assessed by FFQ. Fermented soy product intake but not total soy product intake wassignificantly inversely correlated with hot flush severity (p /H110210.05) after controlling for age and menopausal status. Neither total soy product intake nor fermented soy product intake was significantlycorrelated with menopausal index score.29714.21 A randomised, double-blind crossover study did not find a clear correlation between oestrogenic changes in vaginal cells and effects on menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women (n=52) (Dalaiset al , 1998). This study reported that 12 weeks of dietary supplementation with 45g linseed (p/H110210.009) or wheat (p /H110210.001) resulted in a reduction in the rate of hot flushes with no increase in vaginal maturation index. A reduction in hot flushes was not observed following a soy diet (52 mg totalisoflavones/ day) although this diet did increase vaginal maturation index (p=0.03). 14.22 Murkies et al (1995) reported no benefit of dietary supplementation in a randomised, double-blind study with soy compared with wheat on the incidence of hot flushes or menopausal symptom scores inpostmenopausal women (n=58). Following 12 weeks, both soy and wheat decreased the number of hotflushes (p /H110210.001) and menopausal symptom scores (p /H110210.05). There was no effect on vaginal maturation index. 14.23 The results from a 12 week pilot study in postmenopausal women (n=24) indicated no significant difference between the incidence of hot flushes in women receiving an isoflavone containingsupplement compared with those receiving a placebo. There were no differences between groups withrespect to menopausal symptom scores, levels of FSH, SHBG, thyroid binding globulin (TBG) and vaginalmaturation value (Knight et al , 2001). An 8 week double-blind, randomised intervention study in women (n=182) with a history of breast cancer, who were given soy isoflavone supplements (150 mg totalisoflavones/ day) also failed to find a reduction in the incidence or severity of hot flushes (Quella et al , 2000). 14.24 Two studies investigating the effects of a tablet preparation of isoflavones extracted from red clover found the supplement (40 mg or 160 mg total isoflavones/ day) had no oestrogenic effects on vaginalepithelium or endometrial thickness when compared with the placebo. In addition, the supplement andplacebo had a similar effect in reducing hot flushes (Baber et al , 1999; Knight et al , 1999). 14.25 Postmenopausal women (n=59) were given a soy beverage containing 90 mg isoflavones (Van Patten et al, 2002). A control group (n=64) received a placebo rice beverage. The women recorded frequency andseverity of hot flashes for 4 weeks at baseline, and for 12 weeks while consuming 500 ml of soy orplacebo beverage. No significant differences between the soy and placebo groups in the number of hotflashes were observed. 14.26 Postmenopausal women (n=28, aged 52-82) consumed their habitual diets plus 0, 5 or 10 g ground flaxseed for three seven week periods (Hutchins et al , 2001). The flaxseed diets significantly reduced serum concentrations of to were notaltered with flaxseed feeding. 14.27 One factor that may mitigate against the effects of isoflavones on hot flushes is their poor penetration of the blood brain barrier (see Chapter 11). This may prevent centrally mediated modulation ofendogenous hormone concentrations to reduce the number and severity of hot flushes.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 298 DB - double blind; R - randomised; PC - placebo CO - crossover; PeriM - perimenopausal; PostM - postmenopausal; NS - not statedStudy Design Dose (mg total Duration Effect Reference Intervention isoflavones/day) Soy DB, R, parallel, PC 76 12 weeks Significant /bdownin moderate to severe hot flushes.

Increasing the length of the menstrual cycle ispredicted to lower the body's lifetime exposure to endogenous oestrogens, which may have thepotential to reduce the risk of hormone dependent cancers such as breast cancer. However, the resultsof these studies have been inconsistent. 14.29 Lu et al (1996) reported a non-significant increase in menstrual cycle length, when compared with baseline, in women (n=6) given soymilk (200 mg total isoflavones) daily for 1 month. Menstrual cyclelength remained increased one cycle after termination of soy milk consumption but returned to theoriginal level 5 or 6 cycles later. A decrease in luteal phase oestradiol (p=0.03), luteal phase progesterone(p=0.002) and a time dependent decrease in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (p=0.03) were alsoreported. A crossover study by Watanabe et al (2000) also demonstrated that an isoflavone supplement (20 or 40 mg/ day) increased menstrual cycle length in 60% of women (n=42). However, a decrease incycle length was also experienced in 20% of these women. There was no difference in serum oestradiolduring the follicular or luteal phases. A detailed analysis in 3 women showed a decrease in serumoestradiol throughout the menstrual cycle and increases in SHBG. Increases in T 3and T4were also seen during the follicular phase although the levels decreased during the luteal phase. 14.30 A crossover study by Cassidy et al (1994) demonstrated that daily ingestion of 60g soy protein (45 mg total isoflavones/ day) increased the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (p /H110210.01) and total cycle length by an average of 2.5 days (n=6). There was no increase in the luteal phase. Soy supplementationalso reduced mid-cycle LH oestradiol during the follicular phase (p /H110210.02). There was no change in the levels of progesterone, SHBG or testosterone or oestradiol during the luteal or mid-cycle phases. 14.31 In contrast, a randomised cross over study by Duncan et al (1999b) reported that soy isoflavones (64 or 128 mg total isoflavones/ day) had no significant effects on the length of the follicular, luteal or totalmenstrual cycle (n=14). However, the levels (p=0.009) and FSH (p=0.04) were decreased during theperiovulatory period with 64 mg isoflavones/ day while 128 mg isoflavones/ day decreased levels of freeT 3(p=0.02) and DHEA sulfate (p=0.02) during the early the midfollicular phase (p=0.02). 14.32 A randomised crossover study by Martini et al (1999) reported no effect on any hormone parameters measured when a soy beverage (38 mg total isoflavones/ day) was consumed for the duration of twomenstrual cycles (n=36). In addition, there was no change in menstrual cycle length or the ratio ofoestrogen metabolites 2-hydroxyoestrone:16 /H9251hydroxyoestrone.30114.33 Wu et al (2000) did not observe an effect on menstrual cycle length in 20 women (n=10 Asian and n=10 non-Asian) given soy foods, providing an average of 32 mg/ day total isoflavones. A decrease in serumoestradiol (p /H110210.05) was observed in Asian subjects and the authors suggest this may have reflected the increased intake of isoflavones as a non-significant increase in urinary isoflavone excretion was observedin these subjects. There was no change in SHBG, progesterone or levels of follicular oestradiol. Lu et al (2000a) reported that soymilk supplementation (154 mg total isoflavones/ day) did not change totalmenstrual cycle length or length of follicular phase. There was a slight decrease in the length of theluteal phase but this was not significant. Decreases in serum oestradiol (p /H110210.01) and progesterone (p/H110210.0001) levels were also noted. There was no effect on LH or FSH. 14.34 The effect of isoflavones in regulating the oxidative metabolism of oestrogens has been investigated in some studies. A randomised crossover trial in premenopausal women (n=12) receiving 10, 65 or 129mg/ day total isoflavones (approximately 100 days for each diet followed by 3 weeks washout betweendiets) showed an increase in the ratio of 2-hydroxyoestrone:16 /H9251-hydroxyoestrone (p /H110210.05) and a decrease in the ratio of total potentially genotoxic oestrogens:total oestrogens (p /H110210.05) compared to the low isoflavone diet (Xu et al, 1998). Similar results were found in a longitudinal crossover study by Lu et al (2000b) who reported that consumption of soymilk (containing mean level of 158 mg isoflavones/ day) increased the ratio of 2-hydroxyoestrone:16 /H9251-hydroxyoestrone (p=0.01) in premenopausal women (n=8) for one menstrual cycle duration. 14.35 Premenopausal women (n=34) were provided with 100 mg isoflavones/ day or a placebo for one year in a double blinded trial to look at the effect of dietary phytoestrogens on the ovulatory cycle (Maskarinecet al, 2002). Blood samples were collected at baseline, five days after ovulation and at months 1, 3, 6 and 12 and assayed for oestrone, oestradiol, oestrone sulfate, progesterone, SHBG, FSH, and LH. Menstrualcycle length was unaffected by dietary intervention and no significant changes in sex hormoneconcentrations were observed. 14.36 A study by Kumar et al (2002) reported decreased hormone concentrations after isoflavone intake. Premenopausal women (n=68, aged 25-55 years) were given 40 mg/ day genistein or a placebo over a 12-week period. Supplementation with genistein increased mean menstrual cycle length by 3.5 days(p/H110210.05) from baseline to the third menstrual cycle. The follicular phase of the menstrual was increased by 1.5 days (p=0.08) with supplementation. Genistein supplementation decreased serum free oestradioland oestrone concentrations in 54% of the women in the treatment group compared with 38% in thecontrol group. SHBG levels increased in 41.4% of women in the experimental group compared with 37.5%of women in the placebo group. Oestrone decreased in 56% of women in the experimental groupcompared with 43% in the placebo group. 14.37 Nagata et al (1998) reported decreased oestradiol concentrations in Japanese women (n=31) given a diet supplemented with 400 ml soymilk (containing 109 mg isoflavones) compared to a control diet (n=29)over a two months intervention period of three consecutive menstrual cycles. No statistical significancebetween the two groups was determined, due to the small number of subjects.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 30214.38 Nagata et al (1997) reported decreased oestradiol concentrations on days 11 and 22 of the menstrual cycle of Japanese women (n=50, aged 21-42 years) consuming soy (especially tofu and miso (p /H110210.05) as assessed by FFQ). Soya intake was estimated at 5.0 /H110063.0 g. The hormone concentrations were 73 /H1100648 and 98 /H1100648 pg/mL for oestradiol, and 78 /H1100631 and 85 /H1100632 pg/mL for SHBG, on days 11 and 22 of the cycle respectively. Intake of soy products significantly inversely correlated with oestradiol on days 11 and22 of the cycle after controlling for age, body mass index, menstrual cycle length, and total energy intake.No significant correlation was observed between soy product intake and SHBG. Hormonal effects in men 14.39 There is limited information on the effects of soy or soy isoflavone consumption on reproductive hormones in men. A cross sectional analysis of the relationship between soy product intake andreproductive hormones in Japanese men (n=69) was reported by Nagata et al (2000a). The average isoflavone intake, estimated using a food frequency questionnaire was 22 mg/ day. After controlling forconfounding factors, an inverse correlation was observed between soyfood consumption and serumoestradiol (p=0.009). Inverse correlations were also reported (p=0.05) and serum total testosterone (p=0.05). 14.40In a larger study, British men (n=696) also had their dietary soy intake determined by FFQ (Allen et al , 2001). Multiple regression was used to investigate the association between soy milk intake, and hormonelevels after adjustment for confounders. Soymilk intake was not associated with changes in serumconcentrations testosterone, free testosterone, androstanediol glucuronide, sex hormone-bindingglobulin, or lutenising hormone. 14.41 Three dietary intervention studies have reported effects in men. A 4 week randomised crossover study in men (n=42) consuming 150 g lean meat or 290 g tofu (70 mg total isoflavones/ day) demonstrated thatafter adjusting for weight alterations, the mean ratio of testosterone:oestradiol (p=0.05) was reducedwhile the concentration of SHBG (p=0.01) was increased (Habito et al , 2000). However, these findings were not supported by those of Nagata et al (2001a) who assessed the effect of soymilk on the hormonal status of Japanese men (n=35). Men consumed 400 mL soymilk (90 mg total isoflavones/ day) for 8 weeks.The results indicated that although serum oestrone levels were reduced in the soy treated group(p=0.04), there was no decrease in any of the other hormones measured. A third study by Mitchell et al (2001) reported that daily supplementation with a soy extract (40 mg total isoflavones/ day) for 2 monthsdid not alter sex hormone and gonadotrophin levels (n=14). In addition, there were no effects onejaculate volume, sperm concentration, sperm count or motility or testicular volume. 14.42 In a randomised dietary intervention study, serum oestrogen and androgen concentrations were determined in Japanese men (Nagata et al , 2001b). Subjects supplemented their diet with 400 ml of soy milk (n=35) for 8 weeks or maintained their habitual diet (n=35). Blood samples were obtained at baselineand during the intervention period every two weeks for 12 weeks. Serum oestrone concentrations weresignificantly lower in the soy supplemented group but increased in the control group. There were nostatistical differences in oestradiol, testosterone or SHBG levels showed between the treatment groups.303Effects of phytoestrogens on diabetes 14.43 Diabetes is a disease characterised by a lack of insulin leading to uncontrolled glucose metabolism. Diabetes is either insulin (type 1) or non-insulin (type 2) dependent. It has been suggested that soy mayhave a beneficial effect on some factors of diabetes. A beneficial impact of soy on diabetes was firstnoted in a series of case studies which showed a reduction in urinary sugar excretion in diabetic patientsprovided with a diet including soy beans (Friedenwald & Ruhrah, 1910). More recently, epidemiologicalstudies have suggested that diabetes is more common in Japanese-American subjects compared withJapanese subjects living in Japan. For example, diabetes appears to be 4 times more common in Japanesemen living in America compared with those living in Japan (Fujimoto et al , 1987). Similar comparisons in Japanese women show diabetes is 6 times more common in Japanese women living in America comparedwith those living in Japan (Fujimoto et al, 1991). It has been postulated that this difference may be due to the greater exposure of those living in Japan to phytoestrogens from dietary soy compared to thoseliving in the West. 14.44 The effect of soy on factors of diabetes has been examined in experimental studies in primates. When soy (148 mg isoflavones/ day) was fed to ovariectomised cynomolgus monkeys for 7 months, insulinsensitivity and glucose effectiveness were improved especially when co-administered with oestradiol(Wagner et al , 1997). However, these findings were not reproduced in a similar study of male diabetic cynomolgus monkeys (Wagner et al , 2000). 14.45 No effects on parameters of diabetes were reported in two studies on non-diabetic humans. In a randomised cross-over trial of premenopausal women (n=14), Duncan et al (1999b) reported no effect on plasma insulin concentrations after consumption of soy diets with a range of isoflavone contents (10, 64or 128 mg isoflavones/ day) for 1 menopausal cycle. Similarly there was no effect in a randomised cross-over trial of postmenopausal women (n=18) consuming soy with the same range of isoflavone contents(10, 64 or 128 mg isoflavones/ day) for 26 days (Duncan et al , 1999a). 14.46 In contrast, beneficial effects were reported in a randomised, double blind cross-over trial of postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes (n=32) (Jayagopal et al , 2002). Subjects consumed soy (132 mg isoflavones/ day) for 12 weeks and plasma hormone and lipid profiles were monitored. Soytreatment resulted in decreases in fasting insulin (8%, p /H110210.006) and insulin resistance (6%, p /H110210.003) compared with the placebo group. The authors suggest that dietary soy may improve factors involved intype 2 diabetes. 14.47 In vitro studies suggest that isoflavones may act on insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. Genistein (10-100 /H9262M) increased insulin secretion a dose-dependent manner from islet of Langerhans cells (pancreatic cells which secrete insulin). The authors postulate that genistein modulates insulin secretionviainhibition of tyrosine kinase. Genistin on insulin secretion (Sorenson et al , 1994). In addition, genistein has been shown to inhibit (K iof 0.06 nM) /H9251-glucosidase (an enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism) isolated from bacteria (Lee & Lee, 2001).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 304Key points Most data from studies investigating the effect of dietary supplementation of soy or isoflavones suggest that isoflavones produce weak oestrogenic effects in postmenopausal women. However, dataon whether such supplementation provides relief from menopausal symptoms are inconsistent.Although studies have suggested soy may be beneficial, especially if basal intake is low or vasomotorsymptoms severe, the data are equivocal, as positive results are often not statistically significant andstrong placebo responses are observed. Thus, the weight of evidence does not strongly support theview that supplementation of the diet with soy or isoflavones alleviates menopausal symptoms. The poor penetration of isoflavones across the blood brain barrier may mitigate against centrally mediated modulation of endogenous hormone concentrations to reduce the number and severity ofhot flushes. It has been suggested that phytoestrogens may be protective against the potentially harmful effects of endogenous oestrogens (e.g. oestrogen-dependent breast cancer) by lengthening the menstrualcycle thus, reducing the lifetime exposure of women to these compounds. Data from studies onpremenopausal women suggest that supplementation of the diet with soy or isoflavones producesweak hormonal effects. However, the nature of these effects is inconsistent. Most studies show somesuppression of hormone concentrations (i.e. lutenising and follicle stimulating hormone and/ oroestradiol) during phases of the menstrual cycle with supplementation. Few studies have shownsupplementation to result in a lengthening of the menstrual cycle. Reports of hormonal effects in men from dietary soy or isoflavone supplementation are inconsistent, showing no or weak hormonal effects. An intervention trial has suggested that dietary soy may improve some aspects of diabetes in postmenopausal women with type II diabetes. However, there may be factors in soy other thanphytoestrogens, which aid glycaemic control. No studies have specifically looked at the effect ofphytoestrogens on diabetes although an in vitro study suggests that genistein may increase insulin secretion by pancreatic cells. The relevance of these latter observations to humans is unknown.305References Albert A, Altabre C, Baro Vazquez F. Efficacy andsafety of a phytoestrogen preparation from Glycine max (L.)

Soy consumption alters 9:781-786.311Introduction 15.1 The incidence of a number of cancers, including those of the breast and prostate, has been found to be much higher in Western populations compared with that in countries such as Japan and China.Epidemiological and migrant studies have suggested that racial characteristics and other factors includinglifestyle, diet and fat or fibre intake may play a role in the aetiology of these diseases. One notabledietary difference is the relatively high consumption of soy-based products amongst Asian populations.As such, soy has attracted much attention as a potential chemoprotective factor (Bingham et al , 1998; Cassidy & Faughnan, 2000). However, studies investigating the role of phytoestrogens in these diseaseshave been limited by the paucity of data on phytoestrogen levels in foods and dietary intakes, especiallyfor the lignans. 15.2 It has been suggested that exposure to oestrogen during development or early life may play an important in programming hormonal homeostasis and influence an individuals later life riskof developing cancer. Few human studies on cancer have addressed the possibility that exposure tophytoestrogens at an earlier life stage or over several life stages may confer protective changes.This possibility may, in part, explain why the reduced risk of certain cancers observed amongst migrantsincreases with subsequent generations. 15.3 This chapter reviews the evidence from human, animal and in vitro studies on the role of phytoestrogens in a variety of different cancers. Breast Cancer 15.4 Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer affecting women in the UK and the incidence is rising. Identified genetic factors account for a relatively small proportion (about 4%) of breast cancerin Western populations (Bingham et al , 1998). The risk of developing breast cancer increases markedly with age, although the rate of increase is less after the menopause. 15.5 Hormone related cancers such as breast cancer have been reported to vary by as much as 5- to 20-fold between populations. Studies of migrant populations indicate the highest rates of cancer are typicallyseen in populations following Western diets that are higher in fat and lower in fibre. The lower rates,typically seen in populations consuming a traditional Eastern (e.g. Chinese or Japanese) diet relatively lowin fat and relatively high in fibre and soy (Tham et al , 1998). 15.6 The development of breast cancer is highly dependent on the hormones associated with ovarian function, as such hormone-related events occurring premenopausally, or even in adolescence, may15. Phytoestrogens and cancerCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 312determine whether breast cancer develops postmenopausally. These hormone-related risk factors include early onset of menarche, late onset of menopause, delayed age of first pregnancy and, inpostmenopausal women, an elevated free oestradiol concentration (Bingham et al , 1998). There is also evidence from studies of migrants, that the development of breast cancer can be influenced byenvironmental factors. This is exemplified in a study by Ziegler et al (1993) who reported that Asian- American women born in the West had a 60% higher risk of developing breast cancer than those bornin the East (e.g. China and Japan). Among those born in the West, the risk of breast cancer was 50% higherin those whose grandparents had been born in the West. Among those born in the East, risk wasdetermined by whether, prior to migration, their community had been rural or urban. Migrants fromurban communities had a 30% higher risk of developing breast cancer than those from rural communities. Epidemiological studies 15.7 Four case-control studies conducted in China and Japan have evaluated the association between soy intake and incidence of breast cancer. The results from a case-control study by Lee et al (1991), reported an inverse association between soy protein intake, the ratio of soy to total protein and total soy products,and the incidence of breast cancer in pre- (p= 0.02) but not postmenopausal Singapore-Chinese women(n= 200). Similarly, Hirose et al (1995) reported an inverse association between pre- (p /H110210.05) but not postmenopausal Japanese women. However, no relationship between the soy intake and risk of breastcancer was established in another case-control study (Yuan et al, 1995). The Shanghai breast cancer study, included 1459 breast cancer cases and 1556 age-matched controls. Soy food intake, assessed by a foodfrequency questionnaire (FFQ), was shown to be high with over 96% of women reporting consumptionat least once per week. A non-significant reduction in risk (p /H11021 0.10) was observed amongst women who reported eating soy foods at least once per week (OR= 0.78; 95% CI= 0.52-1.16). Following adjustments forconfounding factors, women in the highest decile compared to the lowest decile intake group wereshown to have a 30% lower risk breast cancer (OR= 0.66; 95% CI= 0.46-0.95). Stratified analysisdemonstrated that the inverse association was more evident in women with a higher body mass index(BMI). The reduction in risk was also greater for women with oestrogen and progesterone receptorpositive (ER+/PR+) breast cancer (OR= any other ER/PR status(Dai et al , 2001). The Shanghai study also obtained information on adolescent (13-15 years) dietary soy food intakes and reported a inverse association between intake at this age and risk of breast cancer(p/H110210.001) in later life. The inverse association was reported for both pre- and postmenopausal women. Details of adolescent soy food intakes were also obtained from the mothers of participant's aged/H1102145 years. For women in the highest soyfood group, these data were also inversely associated (p/H110210.001) with breast cancer (Shu et al , 2001). 15.8 The role of soy and risk of breast cancer has also been evaluated in four case-control studies conducted in the United States (US). A small case-control study by Witte et al (1997) reported that weekly tofu intake may be associated with lowered risk (OR= 0.5) of bilateral breast cancer in premenopausal women(n= 488). However, the reduction in risk was not significant. In addition, the results of a large multicentrestudy conducted among Asian-Americans (n= 597) reported that a high intake of tofu ( /H11091120 times/year) was associated with a lowered risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.85; 95% CI= 0.74-0.99) compared with lowintake ( /H1102113 was demonstrated in both pre- and postmenopausal women313following adjustment for age, geographical location, ethnicity and migration history. However, the association was only significant in women born in Asia and not among women of Asian origin born in theUS (Wu et al , 1996). A case-control study of 501 Asian-American women with breast cancer and 594 control subjects also reported an inverse association between soy intake and breast cancer risk(OR= 0.65; 95% CI= 0.43-0.97) (Wu et al, 2002). Additionally, the odds ratios for adolescent and adult soy intake suggested that a high soy intake in adolescence is inversely associated with breast cancer risk(p trend= 0.04). The risk may be further reduced by soy intake in adulthood (p trend= 0.04). Horn-Ross et al(2001) found that in a study of non-Asian women with breast cancer (n= 1326) and without breast cancer (n= 1657) in the US, consumption of soy milk and soy burgers but not consumption of tofu, miso or otherfoods with added soy was inversely associated with breast cancer risk. In addition, the intakes ofisoflavones and lignans were not associated with a decreased risk. 15.9 Two prospective investigations have investigated intakes of soy foods and breast cancer risk. The prospective cohort study by Hirayama (1986) demonstrated a significant inverse association between theintake of soybean paste soup and the risk of breast cancer in Japanese women (n= 142857). A largeprospective study of 34,759 women in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan investigated soy foodconsumption and risk of breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer is higher in women exposed to radiation,and analyses controlled for radiation dose and age at time of the bombings, as well as reproductive andother non-dietary factors. There was no significant association between breast cancer risk andconsumption of soy foods, tofu and miso soup. Results were similar in a sub analysis of women notexposed to radiation (Key et al , 1999). 15.10 Four further case control studies in western countries and in China have compared urinary excretion of lignans and isoflavones (which is assumed to reflect intake) and the risk of breast cancer. Ingram et al (1997) obtained 3 day urine collections from Australian cases and controls (n= 144) and showed that highexcretion 0.15-0.86)were associated with a lowering of breast cancer risk. This effect was particularly strong for equol, whichwas associated with a 4-fold reduction in risk, although it is surprising that all subjects excreted equol.Enterolactone was associated with a 3-fold reduction in risk. There were no associations with the parentphytoestrogens daidzein and matairesinol, suggesting that metabolism of these compounds by the gutmicroflora may be an important factor in reducing the risk of breast cancer. A case control study byMurkies et al (2000) reported that postmenopausal women with breast cancer (n=18) had lower urinary daidzein (p= 0.03) and a trend lower genistein (p= 0.08) excretion compared with controls. Inaddition, women with breast cancer were found to have higher levels of testosterone than those in thecontrol group (p= 0.05). There were no differences between any of the other hormone parametersmeasured. In a sub-study of a population based case-control study (n= 60) in China, Zheng et al (1999) demonstrated that women with a total urinary isoflavone excretion in the highest tertile displayed a 50%reduction in breast cancer risk compared with those in the lowest tertile (OR= 0.14; 95% CI= 0.02-0.88).Dai et al (2002) reported a reduction in breast cancer risk with urinary highest versus lowest tertiles of excretion in a study of breast cancer cases (n= 250) and controls (n= 250) in Shanghai. Equolwas not measured.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 31415.11 One case control study has examined serum levels of enterolactone in Eastern Finland. The risk of breast cancer was significantly reduced in women classified in the highest quintile of serum enterolactone(OR= 0.38; 95% CI= 0.18-0.77) and this was associated with higher consumption of rye products andintakes of dietary fibre and vitamin E (Pietinen et al , 2001). 15.12 There is one prospective investigation of urine excretion of phytoestrogens. Den Tonkelaar et al (2001) measured urinary of in postmenopausal women with (n= 88) andwithout (n= 268) breast cancer. The results showed that increased urinary excretion of genistein wasweakly, non-significantly associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (OR for highest tertile comparedwith the lowest was weakly, non-significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (OR forhighest tertile compared with the 0.79-2.59). Equol and otherphytoestrogens were not measured in this study. Studies of breast cancer biomarkers 15.13 It is thought that an increased risk of breast cancer may be associated, at least in part, with an individual's lifetime exposure to oestrogen. It has been suggested that an increase in menstrual cycle length resultsin lower exposure to oestradiol and, over a lifetime, this could correlate to a lower risk of breast cancer(Henderson et al , 1985). The findings that menstrual cycles in Asian women consuming a relatively high soy, high-phytoestrogen diet are generally longer than in Western women, and breast cancerincidence is lower in the former group, lend strong support to this theory (Bingham et al, 1998). However, it has been found that irregular rather than longer menstrual cycles are generally related to lower cancerrisk (Bingham et al, 1998; Den Tonkelaar & De Waard, 1996). Additionally, Whelan et al (1994) reported that extremely short or long menstrual cycles were associated with breast cancer risk (see Chapter 14). 15.14 Cassidy et al (1994) reported that textured vegetable protein (TVP), containing 45 mg isoflavones/ day, given daily for 1 month, suppressed gonadotrophin output and increased the follicular phase (p /H110210.01) of the menstrual cycle by 2-3 days in premenopausal women. In addition, dietary intervention with alinseed supplement has also been shown to increase menstrual cycle length. However, the effects seenin this study were not significant and were related to the luteal rather than follicular phase of the cycle(Phipps et al, 1993). In contrast, a study by Duncan et al (1999a) reported that daily supplementation with soy powder, containing 64 or 128 mg isoflavones/ day, over 3 menstrual cycles had no effect on thelength of either the follicular or luteal phase in premenopausal women (n= 14). Taken together, the bodyof evidence is conflicting and it is not possible to attribute longer menstrual cycle lengths of Asianwomen specifically to increased phytoestrogen intake (see Chapter 14). The effects of isoflavone andlignan supplementation on hormones and menstrual cycle in premenopausal women are summarisedin Table 15.1.31515.15 Competing pathways of oestrogen metabolism result in metabolites with differing oestrogenic activities. It has been suggested that the ratio of the metabolites 2-hydroxyoestrogen and 16 /H9251-hydroxyoestrogen may serve as a biomarker of lowered breast cancer risk. A randomised, cross-over study inpostmenopausal women (n= 28) reported that dietary supplementation with flaxseed (5 or 10 g/ day) for21 days significantly increased urinary excretion of 2-hydroxyoestrogen (p /H110210.0005) thereby increasing the ratio of 2-hydroxyoestrogen:16 /H9251-hydroxyoestrogen (p /H110210.05). There were no significant differences in urinary 16 /H9251-hydroxyoestrogen excretion. The authors suggest these results indicate flaxseed has a chemoprotective effect in postmenopausal women (Haggans , 1999). 15.16 An increased urinary 2-hydroxyoestrone:16 /H9251-hydroxyoestrone ratio was also reported in studies of premenopausal women (n= 12) (Xu et al , 1998) and postmenopausal women (n= 18) (Xu et al , 2000) following dietary supplementation with isoflavones (65 or 132 day). noted (Xu et al , 1998; 2000). However, in contrast, a study by Martini et al, (1999) in premenopausal women (n= 36) given a soy beverage, containing 38 mg total isoflavones, over two menstrual cycles did not find a significantdifference in the urinary 2-hydroxyoestrone:16 /H9251-hydroxyoestrone ratio. 15.17 Other markers of a high breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women include increased levels of androstenedione, testosterone and lower levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Studies havesuggested that phytoestrogens may exert a protective effect by lowering plasma free oestrogen andandrogen levels through an increase in SHBG concentration (Adlercreutz et al, 1987; Adlercreutz & Mazur, 1997; Duncan et al, 1999b; Berrino et al, 2001). However, the concentration of SHBG is influenced by many factors, including changes in bodyweight, making cross sectional comparisons difficult. The results ofshort-term intervention studies following supplementation with either flaxseed or soy failed to showany significant increases in SHBG concentration (Baird et al, 1995; Cassidy et al, 1995; Lu et al, 1996; Martini et al , 1999; Nagata et and , 1996; Phipps et al , 1993). 15.18 Duncan et al (2000) investigated the effect of soy protein isolate (10-128 mg isoflavones/ day) on the plasma hormone and SHBG concentrations of postmenopausal women (n= 14) who were divided intoequol and non-equol higherconcentrations of SHBG and midluteal progesterone. The authors conclude that the plasma hormoneprofile of equol excretors is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. The effect ofphytoestrogens on SHBG concentrations is discussed further in Chapter 7.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 316 Table 15.1 Hormonal and menstrual cycle changes associated with soy and flaxseed dietary supplementation in pre-menopausal women.

All subjects were randomly assigned to either their normal diet or a dietsupplemented with 60 g soy/ day (45 mg total isoflavones/ day) for 14 days. Following soysupplementation, biopsies of normal breast tissue were taken and proliferating cells were assessed bythymidine labelling index (TLI) and immunocytochemical staining of the protein Ki67. In a preliminaryreport of this study by McMichael-Phillips et al (1998), a strong correlation between Ki67 and TLI (both markers of cellular proliferation) was observed (r= 0.868; p 0.001). After adjusting for day of menstrualcycle and age of the patient, the proliferation rate of breast epithelium in the soy-treated group wasfound to be significantly increased (p= 0.028) and Ki67 (p= 0.008). Progesteronereceptor expression was also significantly increased in the soy treatment group (p= 0.04). The results ofthe study suggest short-term dietary soy supplementation can induce proliferation in breast tissue ofpremenopausal women with breast disease. 15.20 However, the effects on breast epithelial cell proliferation reported by McMichael-Phillips et al (1998) were not substantiated when the study was expanded. In the enlarged study of premenopausal women(n= 84), no effect on proliferation, oestrogen or progesterone receptor status, Bcl-2 expression, apoptosisor mitosis in breast epithelial cells was observed. However, the levels of apolipoprotein D weresignificantly lowered and expression of the oestrogen responsive gene pS2 was increased in nippleaspirate (p 0.002), suggesting a weak oestrogenic effect on the breast (Hargreaves et al , 1999). 15.21 Increased mammographic density has been associated with a 4- to 6-fold increased risk of breast cancer (Atkinson et al , 1999). It is not known whether phytoestrogens can reduce mammographic density in a similar way to tamoxifen. However, a randomised, placebo controlled study investigating the effect of anisoflavone supplement (40 mg isoflavones/ day) has suggested a significant (p /H110210.05) reduction in density in women aged 56-65 compared to age matched controls (Atkinson & Bingham, 2002). Similar resultswere obtained from a cross-sectional study in Singapore-Chinese women (Jakes et al , 2002). Women (n= 406) were asked to self-report dietary intake of soy and soy isoflavones. Following adjustment forconfounding factors, comparison of the highest and lowest quartiles of dietary intakes found that thehighest 15.22 In contrast, in a cross-sectional study, Maskarinec & Meng (2001) reported a positive correlation between self-reported soy food intakes and percentage breast density in women living in Hawaii (p= 0.04). Animal studies 15.23 Animal studies have provided evidence that soy may have a protective role in breast cancer (Barnes et al, 1990; Connolly et al , 1997; Hawrylewicz et al , 1991; Troll et al , 1980). These effects were attributed to the isoflavones, as dietary treatment with isoflavone free soy abolished the protective effects (Barnes et al, 1990). In contrast, a study by Cohen et al (2000) showed no significant differences in tumour incidence, latency, multiplicity or volume between female mice treated with 10 or 20% (w/w) intact soyprotein or 20% (w/w) isoflavone-depleted soy protein for 18 weeks. Although a non-significant trendCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 318towards inhibition was observed in tumour volume and latency. Constantinou et al (2001) investigated the effect of dietary supplementation with intact and isoflavone depleted soy protein isolate (SPI-n andSPI-d, respectively) (16% w/w), dietary genistein and daidzein either (200 mg/kg diet) or incombination (100 + 100 mg/kg diet) on DMBA induced mammary cancer in rats. SPI-n reduction tumour incidence. Mean tumour multiplicity was reduced and tumourlatency was increased by both diets although the SPI-d diet was more effective. Diets containinggenistein and daidzein did not reduce tumour was significantly reducedonly by daidzein. Similarly, Gallo et al (2001) reported no effect of a standardised soy extract on the incidence and multiplicity of chemically-induced mammary tumours in rodents. 15.24 The protective effect of soy protein isolate or whey on chemically induced breast tumours in rats was investigated by Hakkak et al (2000) over two generations. A 1-day advance in age of vaginal opening was observed in soy protein isolate (p /H110210.05) compared to whey or control animals. Both whey and soy protein isolate caused a reduction in tumour number and increased tumour latency in both theF 1and F2generations compared to controls. Animals receiving whey exhibited a reduction in tumour incidence. However, only animals in the subsequent generation fed soy protein isolate had a reducedtumour incidence. 15.25 Gotoh et al (1998) demonstrated that inclusion of 10% (w/w) miso, 10% (w/w) soybean in number of chemically-induced mammary tumours per animal in youngfemale rats. In addition, inclusion of biochanin A in the diet significantly decreased the incidence (50 mg/kg; p /H110210.01) and multiplicity (10 and 50 mg/kg) of mammary tumours. In contrast, Appelt & Reicks (1999) reported that 13 weeks of dietary supplementation with soy (30-810 mg isoflavones/kgdiet) did not significantly reduce the incidence of chemically induced breast tumours in rats. 15.26 The timing of exposure appears to be a critical factor in determining the efficacy of the chemoprotective effects of isoflavones. Neonatal (5 mg/ animal on post natal day (PND) 2, 4 and 6) and prepubertal (500mg/kg bw on days 16, 18 and 20) subcutaneous administration of genistein reduced the number anddelayed the appearance of chemically induced mammary tumours in a rat model of breast cancer. In ratstreated prepubertally, serum genistein levels were 4 /H9262M and 102 nM on PND 21 and 50, respectively. Genistein was not measured in animals treated neonatally (Lamartiniere et al , 1995 and 1998; Murrill et al, 1996). A further study by Hilakivi-Clarke et al (1999b) also reported that prepubertal exposure of rats to dietary genistein (1 mg/kg bw/ day) decreased the number of tumours per animal but with no overallchange in tumour incidence. In addition, a decrease in tumour growth was noted. 15.27 A dose-related decrease in chemically induced mammary tumours was observed in rats following perinatal exposure to genistein (from conception to PND 21) through the maternal diet (25 or 250 mggenistein/kg diet). Female offspring were also found to have significantly reduced numbers of mammaryterminal end buds (TEBs) at PND 21 and 50 correlating with the reduced number of mammary tumoursobserved. The DNA labelling index, a marker of cellular proliferation, was unchanged following perinatalexposure to genistein although the total number of proliferating cells was reduced. The authorsconclude that by altering mammary gland differentiation early in life, genistein can lower the number ofTEBs, which may reduce later susceptibility to breast cancer (Fritz et al , 1998).31915.28 A study by Constantinou et al (1996) found a 27% reduction in mammary tumour multiplicity in rats aged /H1102235 days following intraperitoneal administration of genistein (0.8 mg/ day) for six months. 15.29 Yang et al (2000) reported that in utero (5, 25 mg/ day subcutaneously) exposure to genistein on PND 16- 20 of gestation or neonatal exposure (12.5 mg/ day subcutaneously) on PND 15 and 18 did not altermammary gland growth, cell proliferation or tumour latency. However, the incidence of chemicallyinduced mammary tumours was greater in animals exposed to genistein compared to controls.Lamartiniere et al (2002) demonstrated that perinatal exposure of female offspring to 250 mg daidzein/kg diet did not inhibit the development of chemically induced mammary tumours. 15.30 In contrast, Hilakivi-Clarke et al (1998) reported that exposure to genistein (20 /H9262g) in utero on gestational days 15-20 increased the density of TEBs in mammary glands compared to control mice. Hilakivi-Clarkeet al (1999a) found that following in utero exposure, by subcutaneous administration of genistein (20-300 /H9262g/ day) to the mothers on days 15-20 of gestation, offspring were more susceptible to chemically induced mammary tumours compared to controls. The authors suggest in utero exposure to genistein may increase the incidence of mammary tumours in the offspring. 15.31 These data suggest that in rodents, exposure to genistein during critical periods of postnatal life can alter mammary gland development and render the adult animals less susceptible to chemicallyinduced mammary tumours. Taken together, the data from Constantinou et al (1996), Fritz et al (1998), Hilakivi-Clarke et al (1998, 1999a and b), Lamartiniere et al (1995, 1998 and 2002), Murrill et al (1996) and Yang et al (2000) suggests that an early postnatal exposure to phytoestrogens may be the most sensitive period for an optimal anticancer effect. However, in utero exposure may increase susceptibility to mammary cancer later in life. 15.32 A study by Ju et al (2001) demonstrated that dietary exposure to genistein ( /H11091250 mg/kg) stimulated growth of MCF-7 tumours athymic, ovariectomised female mice although to a muchlesser extent than oestradiol. The same dose of genistein was also found to increase tumour cellproliferation and expression of the oestrogen-responsive gene pS2. Similar results were reported byAllred et al (2001b) following exposure of mice to genistein (750 mg/kg diet) or genistin (1200 mg/kg diet). Tumours regressed over a 9-week period following removal of genistein or genistin from the diet.Increases in cell proliferation and pS2 expression in subcutaneously implanted MCF-7 tumours were alsodemonstrated following dietary exposure to soy protein isolate containing 150-330 mg/kg genistein(Allred et al, 2001a). Charland et al (1998) reported that intraperitoneal injection (18 mg, 5 times per week) of a soybean extract increased the weight and volume of implanted tumours in mice. In contrast, Santellet al (2000) reported that dietary exposure to genistein (750 mg/kg) did not alter growth of implanted breast tumour cells in athymic mice. 15.33 Ju et al (2002) implanted ovariectomised athymic mice with MCF-7 cells and 2.5 mg oestradiol implants. Mice were also implanted with 2.5 or 5.0 mg tamoxifen and the diet contained 1000 mg/kg dietarygenistein. Tumour growth was increased in oestradiol treated mice after 16 and 32 weeks. Tamoxifen (2.5and 5.0 mg) treatment significantly inhibited oestradiol stimulated tumour growth compared to control.The size of tumours in genistein treated animals were significantly different from controls, showing thatgenistein ablates the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on oestradiol stimulated tumour growth. ExpressionCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 320of oestradiol responsive pS2 and PR and cyclin D1 increased by dietary genistein after oestradiol tamoxifen administration, indicating that genistein can negate tamoxifen's inhibitoryeffect. Dietary genistein treatment significantly lowered plasma oestradiol concentrations in the 2.5 and5.0 mg tamoxifen treated groups. 15.34 A study by Uckun et al (1998) reported increases of /H11022200% in the tumour diameter of human breast cancer xenografts following subcutaneous administration of genistein (1 mg/kg bw/ day) to mice. Hsiehet al (1998) reported that dietary genistein (750 mg/kg diet) increased the number and size of mammary gland terminal end buds of ovariectomised, athymic mice. Genistein was also found to increase thegrowth of implanted MCF-7 tumours in these animals. 15.35 In contrast, Shao et al (1998) reported that subcutaneous administration of genistein (0.1-0.5 mg/kg bw) produced dose-dependent of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 tumoursimplanted into nude mice. Genistein was also shown to dose dependently upregulate tissue c-fos and c jun expression and p21 mRNA and protein levels. Stimulation of apoptosis was also demonstrated. In MDA-MB-231 xenografts, genistein was shown to inhibit angiogenesis by decreasing vessel density andreduce tumour levels of vascular factor (TGF)- /H92521. 15.36 Constantinou et al (2000) treated both ER negative and ER positive cells in vitro with genistein (30 /H9262mol/L) for 2 or 6 days before implanting them subcutaneously into nude mice. The study showed mice injected with ER positive cells treated for 6 days had a longer tumour latency period whereas thoseinjected with ER negative cells treated for 6 days did not develop tumours. Both ER positive and ERnegative cells treated for 2 days did not alter tumour latency. 15.37 Mice received test diets containing either fermented soy bean extract (100, 200, 400 mg total isoflavones/kg diet), genistein (200 mg/kg diet), daidzein (200 mg/kg diet) or genistein and daidzein(100 + 100 mg/kg diet) for 21 days. All diets, with the exception of that containing a combination ofgenistein and daidzein, reduced the ratio of 16 /H9251-hydroxyoestrone: 2-hydroxyestrone in urine. These findings suggest the test diets may exert a cancer protective effect by shifting the metabolism ofoestradiol toward inactive rather than genotoxic metabolites (Kishida et al , 2000). 15.38 Day et al (2001) reported that dietary exposure to genistein (1000 mg/kg diet) did not protect against development of DMBA-induced mammary cancer in ER /H9251wild-type mice. Mammary adenocarcinoma was observed in 56% of these animals. However, tumour development was not observed in ER /H9251knockout mice. The authors conclude induction of DMBA-induced mammary tumours is ER /H9251-dependent. 15.39 A number of studies have investigated the effects of flaxseed and lignan, and /H9251-linoleic acid as well as being a source of dietary fibre and protein. Therefore, it may not be possible to attribute biological effects resulting from dietary flaxseed to the lignans. However, somestudies have used purified SDG to determine if the effects are mediated by lignans.32115.40 To test whether dietary flaxseed could reduce the proliferative effect of dietary fat on the mammary gland, weaning female rats were fed high fat diets containing 0, 5 or 10% (w/w) flaxseed for 4 weeks(Serraino & Thompson, 1991). Non-dose dependent reductions in terminal end bud proliferation inmammary tissue were reported in flaxseed-treated animals compared with control animals. No sucheffect was observed in other mammary cell types (terminal duct, alveolar bud). In a separate experiment,the dietary groups were also administered with a mammary carcinogen. Non-dose dependent reductionsin terminal end bud, terminal duct and alveolar bud cell types were reported in animals following fourweek dietary supplementation with flaxseed compared with control animals. Additionally, nuclearaberrations in cells inversely correlated with (r= 0.94). Theauthors suggest that dietary flaxseed may reduce the risk of mammary cancer by lowering mammarygland cell proliferation and nuclear aberrations. 15.41 Female rats fed on a 0 or 5% (w/w) flaxseed supplemented diet were administered a single dose of a mammary carcinogen. After treatment with the carcinogen some of the animals were switched to theother diet. Mammary tumour number and growth were recorded in each dietary group. Tumour size wassignificantly decreased only in the rats fed flaxseed prior to treatment with the carcinogen. This effectwas less pronounced in animals fed flaxseed continuously. The authors speculate that the effect offlaxseed on the mammary gland may be related to oestrogenic or antioestrogenic components in theflaxseed (Serraino & Thompson, 1992). 15.42 A study examined chemoprotective effects of lignans in female rats fed SDG (1.5 mg/ day, equivalent to 5% (w/w) flaxseed diet) orally for 20 weeks following treatment mammary carcinogen (Thompsonet al , 1996a). Mammary tumour number and growth were recorded in each dietary group following treatment with the carcinogen. The number of mammary gland tumours, per tumour bearing rat and pernumber of rats, was lower in the group of animals fed SDG compared with controls. The authors suggestthat dietary SDG has a chemoprotective effect on tumour development in the mammary gland. 15.43 In a study focussing on the later stages of mammary carcinogenesis, female rats were divided into 5 groups, 13 weeks after treatment with a mammary carcinogen: SDG (1.5 flaxseed or control diet(Thompson et al , 1996b). After 7 weeks on the experimental diets, the size of established tumours was decreased ( /H1102250%) in all groups compared with the control group and was negatively correlated with lignan excretion. New tumour incidence was SDG and 2.5% (w/w) flaxseed groups comparedwith the control group. The authors suggest that dietary SDG reduces the incidence and growth ofmammary tumours. 15.44 In a further study, female rats treated with a mammary carcinogen were fed a diet supplemented with 2.5 or 5% (w/w) flaxseed or orally administered SDG (equivalent to that present in the flaxseed diets) for22 weeks (Rickard et al, 1999). Mammary adenocarcinoma size, multiplicity or incidence was no different in the dietary flaxseed treated groups compared with the control group. Tumour multiplicity in rats givenlow dose SDG was significantly higher than controls, whereas that in rats given the high SDG dose waslower (not significantly). All diets appeared to decrease invasiveness of tumours.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 322In vitro studies 15.45 Elevated levels of oestrogen in plasma can stimulate the growth of mammary cancer cells. The cell line MCF-7, derived from a human breast tumour, is commonly used to assess the oestrogenicity ofcompounds in vitro . These cells express ER /H9251and exhibit a biphasic growth response to oestrogens (see Chapter 8). 15.46 The role of ER /H9251in mediating the proliferative response of breast cancer cells to phytoestrogens is supported by in vitro studies with genistein in MCF-7 cells. Genistein has been shown to transactivate a luciferase reporter gene coupled to the ER /H9251ligand binding domain (Maggiolini et al , 2001; Martin et al , 1978; Panno et al, 1996). Additional evidence that genistein acts viaan oestrogen receptor mechanism was provided by Hsieh et al (1998) who evaluated the effect of genistein on the expression of the oestrogen responsive gene pS2 in cultured MCF-7 cells. These results showed that, at concentrations of1-10 /H9262M, genistein increased pS2 mRNA expression. In addition, Jensen et al (2001) have reported that tumours expressing ER\u00df but not ER /H9251exhibit increased expression of the cellular proliferation markers Ki67 and cyclin A. This suggests ER /H9252is also associated with breast cell cancer proliferation. 15.47 Studies have reported that phytoestrogens have a concentration dependent effect on cell growth (Welshons et al, 1987; Wang & Kurzer, 1997 and 1998; Hsieh et al, 1998). These studies report that genistein has a biphasic effect on cell growth with low concentrations ( /H1102110/H9262M) stimulating DNA synthesis but higher concentrations ( /H1102210/H9262M) inhibiting DNA synthesis. Higher doses of genistein may be cytotoxic. Maggiolini et al (2001) report that genistein cytotoxicity at concentrations of 10 /H9262M to MCF-7 cells is a receptor-independent phenomenon as a similar cytotoxic effect was observed in ER-independentHeLa cells. 15.48 Genistein has also been reported to arrest the cell cycle at the G 2/M phase and stimulate apoptosis in human breast cancer cell lines (Santell et al , 2000; et 2000). 15.49 Choi et al (1998) reported genistein induced cell cycle arrest due in part to reduced cyclin B1 levels and increased levels of the cell cycle regulators p21, cdc2 and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (cdk2). However,Cappelletti et al (2000) reported that genistein did not alter cdc2 expression suggesting that cell cycle arrest at the G 2/M phase is not due to down-regulation of the cdc2/ cyclin B1 complex. Genistein (1 /H9262M) was shown to increase the cell cycle regulators cdk2 and cyclin D1 synthesis, which stimulate cells to enter the cell cycle (Dees et al , 1997). Additional effects of genistein on breast cancer cells include up-regulation of in 1999a and b; (15-45 /H9262M) has also been shown to dose-dependently increase expression of the cell maturation markers intracytoplasmic casein, lipid and ICAM-1 in ER positive and ER negative breastcancer cells (Constantinou et al , 2000).32315.50 In a series of studies, Shao et al (1998a, b and c) reported that genistein (20-70 /H9262M) dose-dependently inhibited growth of MCF-7 cells by induction of p21WAF /CIP1and G2/M cycle arrest. of matrix metalloproteinase(MMP)-9. inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 was found to be genes c-fos and c-jun . 15.51 Upadhyay et al (2001) compared the effects of genistein (90 /H9262M) in malignant and normal breast epithelial cells. In this study, malignant cells were more sensitive to G 2M cell cycle arrest, hyperdiploid progression and induction of apoptosis compared to normal breast cells. The difference betweenmalignant and normal cells is thought to be mediated by a differential effect of genistein on p21 WAF1 as p21WAF1 mRNA and protein levels were induced in normal compared to malignant cells. In addition down-regulation of p21WAF1by antisense cDNA transfection showed that malignant cells were more sensitive to G2/M cell cycle arrest after genistein treatment. 15.52 Rong et al (2001) investigated the effects of 8-prenylnaringenin on aggregation, growth and invasion of MCF7 /6 cells. The E-cadherin/ catenin complex suppresses invasion and is expressed in MCF-7 cellswhereas it is functionally defective in the invasive cell line MCF7 /6. 8-Prenylnarinegenin (10 /H9262M or 1 /H9262M) was shown to stimulate aggregation of MCF7 /6 cells. This effect was inhibited by both an anti-E-cadherinantibody and an anti-oestrogen (0.1 /H9262M). 8-Prenylnaringenin did not affect the invasion of MCF7 /6 cells in the chick heart assay in vitro . 15.53 Other possible mechanisms through which phytoestrogens may influence the risk of breast cancer have also been investigated. It has been suggested that inhibition of hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD)enzymes may reduce the risk of breast cancer by lowering the concentration of endogenous oestrogen(Le Bail et al , 2000; Krazeisen et al , 2001). These enzymes have been shown to inhibit the synthesis of oestrone from androgens (3 /H9252-HSD activity) and oestradiol from oestrone (17 /H9252-HSD type 5 activity). The most potent inhibitors of 3 /H9252-HSD were genistein, daidzein and biochanin A (IC 50= 2.9, 10 and 10 /H9262M, respectively). Coumestrol and formononetin were less potent (IC50/H1102250 /H9262M). In contrast, the most potent inhibitor potent 1, 10 or 5 and /H1102250 /H9262M, respectively). 15.54 Peterson et al (1998) demonstrated differences in the growth inhibition of four breast cancer cell lines following incubation with genistein and biochanin A (3.7 or 26 /H9262M, respectively). The cell lines MCF-7 and T47D had similar sensitivity to both biochanin A and genistein whilst ZR-75-1 and BT-20 cells were 2- to4-fold less sensitive. Further investigations were conducted to determine if the differences in inhibitionwere due to differences in metabolism. Two metabolites of genistein (genistein sulfate and sulfate hydroxylated metabolite) were detected. The IC 50values for growth inhibition did not correlate with any of sulfated did correlate This suggests that hydroxylated methylatedmetabolites may be an active form of genistein in human breast cancer cells. A study by Shen et al (1999) suggested that genistein may have oestrogen receptor-independent antiproliferative effects on breastcancer cells. Growth inhibition of oestrogen receptor negative human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-435)was observed on genistein treatment (IC 50of 27 /H9262M).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 324Key points Most epidemiological studies have investigated soy rather than individual phytoestrogens in breast cancer. Of these, the majority of case control studies have shown a protective trend for soy foods,particularly in Asian women, but results from two prospective studies are conflicting. Studies usingbiomarkers of phytoestrogen intake have shown some protective effects of lignans in the Netherlandsand Finland, and case control studies have also suggested a protective effects of isoflavones. There areno prospective studies in which accurate assessments of food intake and biomarkers of exposure toall phytoestrogens are available so there are insufficient data on which to confirm a causal association. Exposure to oestrogen during development or early life may play an important role in programming hormonal homeostasis and influence an individuals later life risk of developing cancer. The resultsfrom some epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of soy in childhood may protect againstdevelopment of breast cancer later in life. This suggestion may, in part, explain why the reduced riskof certain cancers observed among migrants increases with subsequent generations. It is suggested that a reduction in lifetime exposure to oestrogen may lower the risk of breast cancer. The lower rates of breast cancer in Japanese and Chinese women has been associated with longermenstrual cycles which in turn has been associated with a soy rich diet. The effects of phytoestrogenson menstrual cycle length has been investigated but the weight of evidence suggests it is not possibleto attribute alterations in menstrual cycle to phytoestrogen intake. In one study, short-term dietary supplementation induced a weak oestrogenic effect in premenopausal women with breast disease, as shown by modulation of the levels of the oestrogen responsive geneproducts apolipoprotein D and pS2 in nipple aspirate. However, no effect on breast cell proliferationwas evident. The animal data on breast cancer is conflicting. A number of studies have shown that genistein has a protective effect in animal models of chemically induced cancer. However, similar experiments usingtumour implant models showed that genistein stimulated the growth of implanted mammary tumoursboth by dietary and subcutaneous administration. Studies in animal models with chemically inducedmammary cancer suggest that dietary supplementation with the lignan, secoisolariciresinol may havea chemoprotective effect on breast cancer development although the results are not consistent.Animal studies suggest that exposure to phytoestrogens in early life inhibits development of breastcancer later in life. Genistein has been shown to have a number of effects in vitro including modulation of oestrogen responsive genes, interaction with the cell cycle and alteration of cell differentiation. Genistein hasalso been shown to inhibit and/ or stimulate cell proliferation. The biological response is dependenton the cell type and the concentration applied. However, these effects occur at much higherconcentrations than those likely to occur as a result of dietary exposure. These experimental studieshave provided a number of possible mechanisms through which phytoestrogens may exerttheir effects.325Female reproductive tract cancers Endometrial Cancer Human studies 15.55 Cancer of the endometrium is more common in developed countries and the pattern of hormonal risk factors is similar to that associated with the development of breast cancer. Human case-control studieshave shown that the combined oral contraceptive pill is protective against endometrial cancer. However,substantial evidence suggests unopposed oestrogen replacement therapy contributes to an increasedrisk of developing endometrial cancer (Beral et al , 1999; Bingham et al , 1998). 15.56 In countries such as Japan, where the intake of phytoestrogens is high the incidence of endometrial cancer, relative to the UK, is low (Bingham et al , 1998). A population-based, case-control study conducted among Asian and non-Asian migrants in Hawaii showed that following adjustment for bodymass index there was a significant inverse association between consumption of tofu and/ or other soyproducts and the risk of endometrial cancer. The study also found similar associations with increasedconsumption of foods such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits and seaweed. These observations werelargely independent of other risk factors, although they were limited to women who had never beenpregnant or used oestrogen therapy (Goodman et al , 1997). 15.57 A prospective, placebo controlled trial by Balk et al (2002) investigated the effect of dietary phytoestrogen supplementation in postmenopausal women over 6 months. Participants received eithera soy containing cereal (100 mg total isoflavones/ day) or a placebo cereal. The results indicated thatdietary phytoestrogens did not stimulate proliferation of the endometrium. Hale et al (2001) investigated the effect of supplements containing 50 mg/ day red clover isoflavones, containing a high proportion ofbiochanin A, on biomarker Ki67 in endometrial biopsies from perimenopausal women(n= 30). The results showed dietary supplementation for 3 months did not alter the proliferative index ofKi67. 15.58 To date, there have been no reports linking an increased risk of endometrial cancer with the consumption of phytoestrogens. Animal studies 15.59 The effect of oral genistein (50 mg/kg bw/ day) for 28 days on the growth of implanted endomertial carcinoma cells in rat uterine tissue was investigated by Diel et al (2001). Genistein did not affect tumour growth compared to controls. 15.60Cotroneo & Lamartiniere (2001) investigated the effect of subcutaneous and dietary exposure to genistein on the growth of lesions in a rodent model of endometriosis. The study showed that onlysubcutaneous administration of genistein (16.6 or 50 mg genistein/kg bw) supported growth of theimplanted tissue. In addition, subcutaneous injections of genistein were found to reduce uterine ER /H9251 numbers compared to control. Tissue growth was not supported following dietary exposure to genistein(250 or 1000 mg/kg diet).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 32615.61 The effect of genistein and daidzein on experimentally induced endometrial carcinoma was investigated by Lian et al (2001). In a two-week study, a single subcutaneous injection of genistein (33 /H9262g/kg bw) was found to decrease , in the uteri ovariectomised mice. In contrast, a single dose of daidzein (33 /H9262g/kg bw) administered by subcutaneous injection inhibited expression of c-fos and interleukin-1 /H9251. In a longer term study mice subcutaneous or daidzein In contrast, a study by Newbold et al (2001) reported that mice exposed to subcutaneous exposure to genistein (50 mg/kg bw/ day) on PND 1-5 developed abnormalities of the reproductive tract includingcystic ovaries, of corpora lutea, abnormal oviducts, squamous metaplasia and atypicalhyperplasia of the uterus and an increased incidence of uterine adenocarcinoma in adulthood. Key points No direct associations between phytoestrogen intake and endometrial cancer have been made. Studies in which the diets of peri- or postmenopausal women have been supplemented with isoflavones have not shown any increases in endometrial cell proliferation. The results from animal studies on the effects of phytoestrogens on endometrium have produced conflicting results. Ovarian Cancer Human studies 15.63 A single study has investigated the association between consumption of soy products and ovarian cancer. The case-control study (n=254 cases; n=652 controls) conducted in China, investigated whethercertain dietary factors had an etiological association with ovarian cancer. Using a food frequencyquestionnaire (FFQ), participants were asked to recall how often they consumed 120 different fooditems. The results found a significant inverse association (p /H110210.01; OR=0.04) between soybean products and risk of ovarian cancer (Zhang et al , 2002). In vitro studies 15.64 Chen &Anderson (2001) investigated the effect of physiological concentrations (0.1-10 pM) of genistein and daidzein on human ovarian cancer cell lines. Genistein and daidzein were found to dose dependentlyreduce cell proliferation (p /H110210.001) and cell viability (p /H110210.01). The concentration of IL-6 was decreased whereas TGF- /H92521 was significantly increased (p /H110210.05). The modulating effect of both isoflavones on these cytokines was abolished by an estrogen receptor antagonist suggesting estrogen receptors arerequired, at least in part, for these effects.327Vulvar cancer 15.65 Thigpen et al (2001) reported that mice fed a purified soy protein diet, containing 228 mg total isoflavones/kg diet, for one month had a higher incidence (p /H110210.05) of spontaneous vulvar carcinoma than animals fed a diet containing casein. The incidence was also higher (p /H110210.05) in animals fed the soy based diet at one and three months compared to those fed other rodents diets containing lowerphytoestrogen concentrations of 8, 98 or 151 mg total genistein/ daidzein. However, the incidence ofspontaneous vulvar carcinoma was not significantly different for any of the diets following 6-12 months. Prostate Cancer Human studies 15.66 Epidemiological studies have shown that although the incidence of latent, small or non-infiltrative prostate cancer in Japan and a number of other Asian countries is similar to that in Western countries,the incidence of invasive cancer and associated mortality is far lower (Adlercreutz & Mazur, 1997). It hasbeen proposed that the lower rate of mortality may be due to dietary phytoestrogens. It has been notedthat the level of phytoestrogens in the prostatic fluid of Asian men can be up to 17 times higher thanthose of Western men (Morton et al , 1997). 15.67 The relationship between soy intake and prostate cancer has been investigated in three cohort and four case-control studies that have yielded inconsistent results. One cohort study (Hirayama, 1979) and twocase-control studies (Lee et al , 1998; Oishi et al , 1988) conducted in Asia did not find an association between soy intake and reduction in the risk of prostate cancer. The data from one of these studiesindicated a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer associated with the consumption of miso(Hirayama, 1979). 15.68 In contrast, the results from four North American studies support an inverse association between intake of non-fermented soy foods and prostate cancer. A prospective study (n= 12395) by Jacobsen et al (1998) reported frequent consumption ( /H11022once a day) of soymilk was associated with a 70% reduction in prostate cancer risk (RR= 0.3; p /H110210.05). Severson et al (1989) reported that high ( /H110915 times/week) tofu intake was associated with a non-significant (p= 0.054) reduction in prostate cancer risk (RR= 0.35) in acohort of Japanese men (n= 7999) living in Hawaii. In a study of prostate cancer cases (n= 1619) andcontrols (n= 1618), Kolonel et al (2000) reported a decreased risk of prostate cancer between the highest and lowest quintiles of soy food intake (OR= 0.62; 95% CI= 0.44-0.89). In a case-control study, Villeneuveet al (1999) reported an inverse association between prostate cancer risk and tofu consumption. However, this association disappeared when the data was adjusted for confounders.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 32815.69 Using data from 42 countries, Hebert et al (1998) reported a significant inverse association between consumption of soy products and prostate cancer mortality (p= 0.0001). In addition, a study by Strom et al(1999) demonstrated an inverse association between consumption of foods containing coumestrol (p= 0.03) and daidzein (p= 0.07) and prostate cancer risk in US men. 15.70 Stephens (1997) reported that a prostate sample from a patient who received 160 mg phytoestrogens daily for 1 week prior to surgery showed mild patchy microvacuolations and significant tumour cellapoptosis. Similarly, a preliminary study has demonstrated that 2/3 patients who received a dailysupplement containing 100 mg total isoflavones for one month prior to surgery showed signs of tumourregression and tumour cell apoptosis (FSA project T05002). 15.71 The results of studies conducted in the US and UK suggest that consumption of soy can reduce the risk of prostate cancer in men. As the development of prostate cancer is thought to be dependent onexposure to male reproductive hormones, it has been suggested the protective effect of soy may resultfrom alterations in endogenous hormone concentrations. Demark-Wahnefried et al (2001) demonstrated that the levels of total serum testosterone was significantly decreased in men (n= 25) whose diet wassupplemented with 30 g/ day flaxseed for an average of 34 days (p /H110210.05). No differences were observed in levels of prostate serum antigen (PSA). Similarly, a randomised, double-blind crossover study in elderlymen (n= 34) with elevated PSA found that twice daily consumption of a soy beverage (70 mgisoflavones/ day) for 6 weeks had no effect on PSA or the proto-oncogene p105erbB-2 (Urban et al, 2001). Animal studies 15.72 The development of prostate cancer in men, and spontaneous tumours of the prostate seminal vesicle (PS-V), are thought to share common mechanisms and characteristics. Animal studies have providedsupportive evidence of a protective role for isoflavones in the development of the disease. Pollard et al (2000a) reported that the incidence of spontaneous PS-V tumours in rats genetically susceptible toprostate cancer was suppressed in animals maintained on a diet containing 410 mg isoflavones/kg. Only3% of animals were found to develop the tumours when fed the diet from the age of 2-24 monthscompared with 30% of animals maintained on a control diet. A further study demonstrated a longerlatency period in development of chemically induced PS-V tumours in rats fed a diet supplemented withsoy protein isolate (4 mg genistein/ day). Reduced levels of testosterone and testes weights wereobserved in rats fed a soy meal diet (4 mg genistein/ day) (Pollard et al , 2000b). 15.73 Landstr\u00f6m et al (1998) reported that the development of transplanted prostate tumours was inhibited in rats receiving a diet containing 33% (w/w) soy flour compared to controls. Similar findings have also beenreported by Zhang et al (1997). In addition, diets containing concentrates of soy phytochemicals, but not soy protein isolate alone, were found to inhibit the growth of tumours in mice (Zhou et al, 1999). Aronson et al (1999) demonstrated that a low-fat diet containing soy protein and isoflavones decreased the growth rate and final weight of human LNCaP prostate tumours grown in severe-combinedimmumodeficient mice. A 70%, non-significant, reduction in testosterone was also noted. Bylund et al329(2000) reported that, compared to controls, the number and size of transplanted tumours was reduced following dietary supplementation with rye-bran or soy. In addition, the amount of PSA secreted wasdecreased in the rye-bran and soy fed groups compared to controls although tumour cell apoptosis wasincreased in these groups. 15.74 It has been demonstrated that in utero exposure to soybeans, from the maternal diet, delayed the development of morphological changes, similar to those observed in human prostatic intra-epithelialneoplasia, in male mice oestrogenised with DES shortly after birth (Makela et al , 1995). 15.75 Onozawa et al (1999) reported that dietary supplementation with isoflavones (100 mg/kg diet) reduced the incidence of chemically induced adenocarcinomas in the seminal vesicles and prostate of rats. Astudy by Schleicher et al (1999) demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of genistein (50 mg/kg bw) every 12 hours for 31 days, significantly inhibited the growth of transplanted K1 prostate tumour cellsin rats and resulted in fewer invasive tumours and metastases. 15.76 It has also been suggested that genistein reduces the risk of prostate cancer by down-regulation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway. Dalu et al (1998) demonstrated that genistein inhibited the expression of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in the dorsolateral prostate of rats. Inhibition of tyrosinephosphorylated EGF receptor and ErbB2/Neu receptor expression was also demonstrated. Theinhibitory effect on the EGF receptor was significant at 1000 mg genistein/kg diet. 15.77 The lack of a suitable animal model of human prostate cancer has led to the development of a transgenic model. The model, known as TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate), whichspontaneously induces transformation in prostate tissue in vivo (Greenberg et al , 1995; Abate-Shen & Shen, 2000). TRAMP mice were fed mg/kg) from weaning until 28-30 days (100 mg/kg diet) significantly reduced the number of mice exhibiting poorlydifferentiated prostate adenocarcinoma (Mentor-Marcel et al , 2001). 15.78 Weber et al (2001) reported a significant decrease in ventral prostate weight, which was not associated with a decrease in prostate 5 /H9251-reductase activity in adult male rats following a phytoestrogen rich diet (600 mg/kg) for approximately 5 weeks. Testosterone and androstenedione plasma concentrations weresignificantly lowered suggesting altered regulation of 17 /H9252-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for testosterone synthesis, as a possible mechanism of reduced prostate weight. The studyalso reported that expression of testicular steroidogenic acute regulatory peptide (StAR) protein wasunchanged indicating a lack of effect on early stage of steroid synthesis and cholesterol incorporation. 15.79 Fritz et al (2002) reported that dietary exposure of rats to genistein from either conception until day 70 postpartum (0-250 mg/kg diet) or from day 56 to day 70 postpartum (250 or 1000 mg/kg diet) resultedin a dose-dependent down-regulation of androgen receptor and ER /H9251and ER /H9252mRNA in the prostate. Increased testosterone concentrations were also reported. The increase in testosterone was significantfor animals exposed from conception until PND 70 only.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 330In vitro studies 15.80Shen et al (2000) demonstrated that genistein (20 /H9262M) inhibited cell cycle progression at the G1-phase in human prostate cancer cells. In addition, genistein increased expression of the cyclin-dependantkinase inhibitors p27 KIP1and p21WAF1in a dose-dependent manner. concentrations of genistein ( /H1109120 /H9262M). Mitchell et al (2000) reported that genistein, daidzein, equol and coumestrol inhibit cell prostate cancer cell growth at concentrations /H1108810/H9262M). Genistein was shown to cause DNA strand breakage at /H1108810/H9262M, however, daidzein did not cause similar effects at concentrations up to 500 /H9262M. These results suggest that despite structural similarities both compounds inhibit cell growth by different mechanisms. 15.81 Genistein (4.6-37 nM) has also been shown to decrease, in a dose-dependent manner, the growth of surgically removed specimens of human benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer tissue inculture (Geller et al , 1998). 15.82 A study by Kyle et al (1997) reported that genistein (50 /H9262M) caused apoptosis and down-regulated the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in PC-3 and DU-145prostate carcinoma cells. Further investigations into the mechanisms by which genistein causes apoptosishave demonstrated that it can prevent the transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)- /H9260B from entering the cell nucleus and activating gene transcription. In cells NF- /H9260B is bound to inhibitory proteins known as I /H9260B, genistein has been shown to prevent I /H9260B phosphorylation thus inhibiting the action of NF- /H9260B (Davis et al, 1999). Genistein, has also been found to cause G 2/M cell cycle arrest, significant down-regulation of cyclin B and up-regulation of p21WAF1in prostate carcinoma cells (Choi et al , 2000; Davis et al , 1998). 15.83 Hillman et al (2001) reported that genistein may potentiate the effect of radiation on prostate cancer (PC 3) cells. The study showed that pre-treatment of PC-3 prostate cancer cells with 15 /H9262M genistein for 24 hours followed by irradiation for 3 days significantly inhibited DNA synthesis, decreased cell growthand decreased the ability of these cells to form colonies. The effects of genistein combined withradiation were greater than either treatment alone. 15.84 In contrast to the animal studies, genistein and biochanin A failed to inhibit EGF receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation in LNCaP and DU-145 prostate cell lines. Daidzein failed to inhibit cell growthand EGF receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation, suggesting differences in chemical structure determinesthe inhibition of cell growth and phosphorylation in vitro (Peterson & Barnes, 1993). 15.85 Davis et al (2000) reported that treatment with genistein resulted in a similar dose-dependent inhibition of both androgen dependent and androgen independent human prostate cancer cell lines. However,genistein had a differential effect on PSA expression. In the androgen dependent cell line, lowconcentrations of genistein (1-5 /H9262M) decreased PSA mRNA and protein expression whereas higher concentrations ( /H1102210/H9262M) were required to cause similar effects in the androgen independent cell line. 15.86 Lin et al (2001) have reported that the mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol have been shown to inhibit growth of human prostate cancer cell lines (10-100 /H9262M).331Key points The epidemiological data on soy intake and prostate cancer are inconsistent. One study in an Asian population has shown an increased risk with intake of fermented soy foods such as miso. Otherstudies in Asian populations report no effect. However, studies carried out in Western populationsreport an inverse correlation with consumption of non-fermented soy foods. Only a single study hasspecifically investigated phytoestrogens. The study carried out in a US cohort showed a reduced riskassociated with consumption of foods containing phytoestrogens. In contrast, most of the research in rodents has specifically examined the effects of phytoestrogens on models of prostate disease. The concentrations used in these experiments are very high comparedwith likely dietary exposure levels in humans in the UK. Generally these studies have shown aprotective effect either in tumour implant or chemically induced models of cancer. In vitro experiments have shown that phytoestrogens can modulate components of the cell cycle pathway and inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells and stimulate apoptosis. However, these effectswere only found to occur at much higher concentrations greater than would be expected from normaldietary intakes. Colorectal cancer Human studies 15.87 Comparisons between international cancer rates and dietary intakes are often used as the basis for identifying dietary factors used in the aetiology of specific cancers. A cross-cultural study of 38countries found no association between soybean intake and risk of colon cancer. The countries inthis study were chosen on the basis of reliable cancer mortality data, but were not identified(McKeown Eyssen & Bright-See, 1984). 15.88 Further epidemiological studies have suggested a protective effect of soy products in colorectal cancer although the data have not been consistent. Two case control studies have shown that consumption ofsoy products had a protective effect on risk of rectal cancer. A case-control study conducted in Chinaby Hu et al (1991) found that soybean products (bean sprouts, bean curd and other products) had a protective effect on rectal but not colon cancer risk (n= 111 colon cancer cases; n= 225 rectal cancercases). The association with rectal cancer was graded and significant in men but not in women. Watanabeet al (1984) demonstrated that consumption of soybeans and soybean curd was associated with a non- significant reduction in rectal cancer (RR= 0.15 and 0.12 respectively). A reduction in the risk of coloncancer was not demonstrated. A case-control study by Nishi et al (1997) demonstrated that consumption of traditional Japanese soyfoods was associated with a non-significant reduction in the risk of both colon(RR= 0.96 for miso soup; 0.79 0.79 for miso soup; 1.02 for tofu). Threeother studies considered the relationship between consumption of soy and risk of colorectal polyps.Witte et al (1996) reported that the OR for consumption of one or more servings of tofu per week wasCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 3320.55 (CI= 0.27-1.11, p= 0.17). Le Marchand et al (1997) reported a relationship between colorectal cancer risk and the lowest and high quartiles of legume and soy product consumption in women (OR= 0.5; 95% 0.5-1.2). However, this relationship was not evident whencorrected for the fibre content of the food. Kono et al (1993) reported no effect at the third tertile of soy paste soup intake for large and small adenomas of the colon were 0.72 (CI= 0.37-1.40) and 0.73(CI= 0.33-1.59), respectively. 15.89 In contrast two case-control studies have reported that intake of fermented soy products is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Haenszel et al (1973) reported fermented soybean intake was associated with an increase (p /H110210.05) in colorectal cancer among Issei Japanese (RR= 1.6), but not Nisei or Hawaiian Japanese living in Hawaii. In addition, Tajima & Tominaga (1985) reported that consumptionof miso soup increased (p /H110210.05) the risk of developing rectal cancer (RR= 2.05). No associations were reported between colon cancer and consumption of miso soup or other soybean products. However,consumption of soybean products was inversely associated with rectal cancer (p= 0.03) in a case-controlstudy (n= 181 cases and n= 653 controls) (Hoshiyama et al , 1993). Animal studies 15.90 Several animal studies have examined the effect of soy and/ or isoflavones on chemically induced colon cancer but have produced conflicting results. Two studies demonstrated that dietary genistein canprotect against the development of chemically induced pre-neoplastic lesions of the rat colon. In astudy by Steele et al (1995) 5 weeks of dietary supplementation with genistein (75 mg/kg aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in rats. The second 12 weeksof dietary supplementation with 0.015% (w/w) genistein (as theformation ACF than diets supplemented with soy flour or full-fat soy flakes, containing 0.05% (w/w)genistein derivatives (as the glucosides) (Thiagarajan et al , 1998). In contrast, Gee et al (2000) found that a soy supplemented diet had no effect on colonic crypt mitosis or apoptosis in a rat model of chemicallyinduced colon cancer. 15.91 Sorensen et al (1998) demonstrated that feeding a Western diet (high fat, low fibre and calcium) containing isoflavones had no effect on the development of intestinal cancer in a murine model orintestinal cancer. In addition, a study by Rao et al (1997) demonstrated that although dietary administration of genistein (250 mg/kg diet) significantly increased the multiplicity of chemicallyinduced non-invasive adenocarcinomas, and total adenocarcinomas, the incidence of colonadenocarcinoma or multiplicity of invasive adenocarcinoma was unchanged. 15.92 Davies et al (1999) demonstrated that soy (250 mg isoflavones/kg diet) did not protect against experimentally induced colon cancer in rats. Indeed those given isoflavones had increased numbers ofsmall ACF, thought to be markers for the disease, at 12 weeks. However, a diet containing 30% rye-bransignificantly reduced the number of colon tumours. Although there was no change in the total numberof ACF at 12 weeks with the rye diet, the total number of large ACF was reduced. The authors concludedthe lignans in the rye bran diet were likely to be responsible for this effect. McIntosh et al (1995) reported that there were no differences in the incidence of experimentally induced colon tumours in rats fed awhey-based diet (213 g/kg diet) than those fed a soybean diet (333 g/kg diet).33315.93 Hakkak et al (2001) investigated the effect of lifetime dietary supplementation with soy protein isolate (430 mg total isoflavones/ day), compared to a casein diet on chemically induced colon cancer in F2 generation male rats. Rats fed soy protein isolate had a reduced incidence of colon tumours comparedto those receiving a casein based diet. 15.94 Studies using rodent models of colon cancer have shown that flaxseed can reduce the number of chemically induced aberrant crypts, which are considered to be early markers of the disease(Jenab & Thompson, 1996; Serriano & Thompson, 1992; Thompson, 1998). Davies et al (1999) reported that a rye-bran diet, containing lignans, produced a highly significant inhibitory effect on the number ofexperimentally-induced colon tumours in rats. In vitro studies 15.95 Park et al (2001) demonstrated that genistein (10-60 /H9262M) inhibited the growth of human colon cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Genistein also caused cell cycle arrest at the G 2/M phase and increased p21 protein expression and activated p21 promoter reporter constructs. Arai et al (2000) have also reported that genistein (10 /H9262M) had a slight inhibitory effect on the growth of human colon cancer cells. Salti et al (2000) reported that genistein has a concentration dependent effect on colon cancer cell growth. Genistein increased apoptosis and caused G2/M cell cycle arrest at concentrations /H1109160 /H9262M. Sung et al (1998) demonstrated that enterodiol and enterolactone (100 /H9262M) inhibited cell proliferation of human colon tumour cell lines (LS174T, Caco-2, HCT-15 and T-84) when treated for 8-10 days. However,these cell lines were shown not to be oestrogen responsive. Key points Epidemiological studies in humans have suggested that consumption of non-fermented soy products may lower the risk of colorectal cancer. Whereas, consumption of fermented soy products wasgenerally associated with an increased risk. To date, no studies have specifically examined the effectof phytoestrogens. The research in animal models on isoflavones has also produced conflicting data, with studies showing that genistein had a protective or no effect against chemically induced cancer or modulated the levelsof biomarkers of the disease. Studies suggest that dietary lignans may result in potentially beneficial changes in animal models of colorectal cancer. In vitro data are sparse but show that genistein interacts with cell cycle processes to inhibit the growth of human colon cancer cells.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 334Stomach cancer Human studies 15.96 Epidemiological studies exploring the relationship between soy consumption and the risk of stomach cancer have provided inconsistent results. However, an increased risk has most often been associatedwith the consumption of fermented soy products, whereas, protective effects have been associated withthe consumption of unfermented soy products (reviewed by Messina et al , 1994). This is supported by a meta-analysis by Wu et al (2000) of 14 studies which showed that stomach cancer was associated with high intakes of fermented soy foods (OR= 1.26; contrast, a meta-analysis of 10 studiesshowed that stomach cancer was inversely associated with consumption of soy foods (OR= 0.72; 95%CI= 0.63-0.82). 15.97 A study by Nagata (2000) demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between the rate of mortality from stomach cancer and consumption of soy protein in Japanese men (p= 0.04). Non-significant inversecorrelation's were also noted for total soy (p= 0.07) and isoflavone (p= 0.08) intakes. Analysis ofthe food intake of households in 1040 census tracts in Japan demonstrated a significant inverseassociation between stomach cancer and tofu consumption in men and women. Following multivariateanalysis, a non-significant inverse association between consumption of miso soup and stomach cancerwas also noted in the women from this study (Nagai et al , 1982). A large-scale prospective study (Hirayama, 1982, 1984 and 1986) which followed 122261 men and 142857 women for 13 years, demonstratedsignificant inverse associations between consumption of soybean paste and the risk of gastric cancer. Inaddition, ten case-control studies have reported significant inverse associations between stomachcancer and consumption of miso soup (Segi et al , 1957), soybeans (Y ou et al , 1988; Sasaki et al , 1990; Ji et al, 1998; Gao et al, 1999), bean curd (Haenszel et al, 1972 and 1973; Lee et al, 1995; Huang et al, 2000) and soy-milk (Yingman & Songlin, 1986). 15.98 A cohort study in 7990 American men of Japanese ancestry living in Hawaii found no significant association between ingestion of miso soup or tofu and risk of gastric cancer. However, a protectivetrend associated with tofu consumption was noted (Nomura et al, 1990). In addition, the results from five case-control studies found no significant association between risk of stomach cancer and consumptionof miso (Hirayama, 1971), bean curd (Tajima & Tominaga, 1985; Lee et al, 1995) or unfermented products (Hoshiyama & Sasaba, 1992; Ahn, 1997). 15.99 Hirayama (1971) reported that fermented soybeans increased the risk of developing stomach cancer, whereas bean curd decreased the risk. However, no significant associations between the consumption ofsoybeans, fried bean curd or bean paste and gastric cancer were demonstrated. Five further case-controlstudies also demonstrated an association between the consumption of miso soup or fermented soypaste and an increased risk of stomach cancer (Crane et al, 1970; Hoshiyama & Sasaba, 1992; Hu et al, Lee et al , 1995).335Animal studies 15.100 Studies evaluating the effect of soy products or isoflavones on experimentally induced stomach cancer have yielded conflicting results. A study by Tatsuta et al (1999) demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of genistein (30 mg/kg bw) to rats every other day for 25 weeks significantly reduced theincidence of experimentally induced gastric cancer. Genistein also significantly decreased the labellingindex and vessel counts of the antral mucosa and gastric cancers and significantly increased theapoptotic index. Kim et al (1985) demonstrated that inclusion of 10% maejoo (Korean fermented soybean paste) in the diet of rats significantly inhibited experimentally induced stomach tumours.However, the study by Watanabe et al (1999) demonstrated that inclusion of 10% miso in the diet of rats had no effect on the number of stomach tumours induced by X-ray irradiation. In vitro studies 15.101 Matsukawa et al (1993) reported that treatment of human gastric cancer cells with genistein resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth. Further analysis showed that genistein (40 /H9262M) arrested the cell cycle at the G 2/M phase. Cell cycle arrest was reversed following removal of genistein from the culture medium. Daidzein did not arrest cell cycle progression at the G2/M phase. Yanagihara et al (1993) showed that genistein and biochanin A inhibited growth of human stomach cancer cell lines byactivation of apoptosis. Key points Most of the published epidemiological studies have examined the association between soy products and the risk of stomach cancer, with only one study specifically investigating the effect ofphytoestrogens. Currently, the epidemiological data linking soy consumption to risk of stomach cancer are inconsistent. A reduction in risk has most often been associated with unfermented soy products or isoflavones.Other published studies showed either no effect or an increased risk associated with the consumptionof fermented soy products. In contrast, animal studies suggest that fermented soy products either significantly inhibited or had no effect on the number of experimentally induced tumours. Only one study has examinedphytoestrogens and showed that genistein significantly reduced the incidence of experimentallyinduced gastric cancer. Results from in vitro studies suggest that the isoflavones genistein and biochanin A can inhibit growth of human gastric cancer cell lines either by cell cycle arrest or induction of apoptosis.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 336Lung Cancer Human studies 15.102 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. Although there are epidemiological data to suggest consumption of soy products has a protective effect in lung cancer,the information is limited. A protective effect for tofu was reported by Swanson et al (1992) who investigated the relationship between diet and lung cancer among male residents with primary lungcancer (n= 428) living in a mining community in Yunnan Province, China. Participants were asked to recalleating habits during adult life and report usual intake (frequency in times per day, week, month or year)of 31 food items or food groups. The results showed a inverse dose-response relationship betweenconsumption of bean curd (p /H110210.01) and risk of lung cancer after adjustment for confounding factors. A retrospective study in non-smoking, female lung cancer patients (n= 88) and controls (n= 137) living inHong Kong, also demonstrated a significant inverse association between consumption of tofu/ soy beanproducts and lung cancer risk after adjustment for confounding factors. In this study, the protectiveeffect was greater in those with adenocarcinoma or large cell lung tumours (Koo, 1988). 15.103 Three case-controls studies reported inverse associations between soy intake and lung cancer. Takezaki et al (2001) reported that consumption of tofu /H110915 times/week reduced the risk of lung adenocarcinoma in 0.52; 95% CI= 0.30-0.91) and n= 381 controls).In a case-control study decreased risk of lung carcinoma was associated with daily tofu consumptionin men 1999). A case-control study by Seow et al (2002) demonstrated that consumption of soy foods had a protective effect amongst lifetime non-smoking Chinese women living in Singapore (n= 176 cases;n= 663 controls). The OR for women in the highest tertile compared to the lowest was 0.53 (95%CI= 0.34-0.81). A protective effect was not observed amongst women who were smokers (n= 127 cases;n= 102 controls). Isoflavone intake was also calculated based on frequency of intake and portion sizeof eight common local soy foods. The adjusted OR among non-smokers for the highest tertilecompared to the lowest was 0.56 (95% CI= 0.37-0.85). 15.104 In contrast, two case-control studies in lung cancer patients in China found no significant protective effect between the consumption of soybean products and the risk of lung cancer (Wu-Williams et al , 1990; Hu et al , 1997). Animal studies 15.105 The results from animal studies have yielded more consistent results. Lee et al (1992) demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of biochanin A (0.125 mg/ day) 3 times/week for 6 weeks significantlyprevented the development of chemically induced lung tumours in mice.33715.106 In addition, results from three studies suggest that dietary supplementation with isoflavones can lower experimentally induced lung metastasis. Li et al (1999) demonstrated that dietary supplementation with isoflavones (120 mg/kg diet) significantly inhibited the number of pulmonary metastases induced bymurine melanoma cells in male mice. Cross-sectional area and tumour volume were also reduced.Similar findings were reported by Yan et al (1997) following dietary supplementation with a soy protein isolate (200 mg isoflavones/kg diet). 15.107 Menon et al (1998), demonstrated that orally administered genistein (54 mg/kg bw) significantly inhibited the formation of lung tumour metastases caused by melanoma cells in male mice. Levels oflung collagen hydroxyproline and serum sialic acid levels, a marker of metastasis, were also loweredfollowing treatment with genistein. These effects were not observed following administration ofdaidzein. Both daidzein and genistein were shown to increase the lifespan of mice by 16% and 47.7%respectively. However, lifespan was further increased by 70%, following treatment with genistein (70 mg/kg bw). 15.108 Studies have also examined the effect of lignans on experimentally induced tumour metastasis to the lung. Mice were fed 2.5, 5 or 10% (w/w) flaxseed diets (equivalent to doses of 0.22, 0.44 and 0.94 mgSDG/ day) for two weeks (Yan et al 1998). Animals continued on these diets for two weeks after i.v. injection with murine melanoma cells. The 5 and 10% number, growth andvolume of pulmonary tumours. 15.109 In a study by Li et al (1999d), mice were fed a diet supplemented with SDG at concentrations equivalent to 2.5, 5 and 10% (w/w) flaxseed. Animals continued on these treatments for a further two weeks afteri.v. injection with murine melanoma cells. A reduction in the number of pulmonary tumours wasreported in animals fed the highest dose of SDG. Dietary supplementation with SDG also decreasedtumour size and volume in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro studies 15.110 Lian et al (1998) reported that treatment with genistein (30 /H9262M) resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in human lung cancer cells. In addition, genistein was found to have arrested cellcycle progression at the G 2/M phase, caused up-regulation of p21WAF1expression and induced apoptosis. Similar results were also reported by Lian et al (1999) using human lung cancer cell lines expressing either a wild-type or a mutated p53. This study also found genistein increased expression ofwild-type p53 whilst the level of mutant p53 remained unchanged. The apoptosis gene Bax was alsofound to be up-regulated whereas Bcl-2 levels remained unchanged.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 338Key points A single study has investigated the effect of phytoestrogens in lung cancer, which showed that isoflavone consumption was weakly associated with a reduction in lung cancer risk in a Chinesepopulation. Other published studies in Chinese populations, which examined the effects of soy ratherthan phytoestrogens also reported an inverse association between soy consumption and the risk oflung cancer. Animal data have shown that genistein can inhibit development of experimentally induced lung tumours and genistein and secoisolariciresinol may inhibit experimentally induced metastasis ofmelanoma cells to the lung. Genistein has been shown to act as an inhibitor of cell growth in lung cancer cell lines and can induce apoptosis. Main Summary 15.111 It is generally accepted that lifetime exposure to oestrogen is related to the risk of developing breast cancer. It has also been suggested that exposure to oestrogen during development or early life may playan important role in programming hormonal homeostasis and may influence the risk of developingcancer later in life. 15.112 Most studies on breast cancer (and other cancers) have not addressed the possibility that exposure to phytoestrogens at an earlier life stage or over several life stages may confer protective changes.Although the weight of evidence in humans supports a protective role for soy in terms of breast cancerrisk, the human and animal data for phytoestrogens are conflicting. 15.113 Epidemiological and migrant studies have suggested racial characteristics and other factors including lifestyle, diet and fat or fibre intake may play a role in the development of cancer. Geneticpolymorphisms in combination may also make a contribution to an individual's susceptibility to cancer.The interpretation of epidemiological studies is complicated also by the paucity of data onphytoestrogen concentrations in foods and dietary intakes. 15.114 The epidemiological evidence, albeit limited, suggests a protective role for soy-based foods in endometrial cancer. No studies have specifically addressed the role of phytoestrogens. 15.115 Human studies have investigated the effect of soy intake and reported prostate cancer risk, which appear to differ between Eastern and Western populations. A single study in humans has specificallyinvestigated phytoestrogens. This study showed a reduced risk associated with consumption of foodscontaining coumestrol and daidzein. Animal data suggest that diets supplemented with soy orisoflavones may inhibit the development of implanted, spontaneous and chemically induced tumoursof the prostate in rodents.33915.116 There is no evidence from human studies to attribute the protective effect of fibre, fruit and vegetables against colorectal and stomach cancer to their phytoestrogen content. In addition, there is little or noevidence to associate phytoestrogen intake with a reduced risk of cancer of the ovary or lung. 15.117 The data from the many epidemiological studies is limited in terms of assessing the effect of dietary phytoestrogens in the UK population. This is due to the fact that many have been conducted in Eastern(e.g. Chinese or Japanese) populations and may be confounded by ethnic differences and other dietaryfactors. Thus, while in vitro studies and investigations in animals may provide some suggestions that these compounds have protective effects for some cancers, the clinical data to convincingly supportthese claims are not available.

Following concerns that have arisen as a result of using soy-based formulae, a number of countries have issued advice regarding its use and infant feedingguidelines. These guidelines are summarised below. To date, the United Kingdom (including NorthernIreland) and New Zealand are the only countries to have issued advice with specific reference tophytoestrogens and soy-based infant formula. United Kingdom 16.2 In 2002, figures published by the Department of Health estimated that in the UK, soy-based formulae are fed to approximately 1% of non-breast fed infants aged 4-10 weeks rising to approximately 2% ofinfants aged 10-14 weeks (Department of Health, 2002). The Department of Health advised that althoughbreastfeeding was preferred, where this was not possible, infant formulae could provide an alternativesource of nutrition. For the majority of bottle-fed infants cows' milk formula is suitable. However,soy-based infant formulae can be given to the small number of infants who cannot tolerate cows' milkformula. Parents who are seeking a vegetarian or vegan diet may also choose to feed their infants asoy-based formula. 16.3 In 1996, the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Foods, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) reviewed phytoestrogens with particular reference to soy infant formula and published astatement. The COT endorsed advice issued by the Department of Health that breast milk and cows' milkformulae are the preferred sources of nutrition for infants. However, they recommended that womenwho had been advised by their doctor or other health professional to feed their baby soy-basedformulae should continue to do so (Department of Health, 1996). 16.4 The advice issued by the COT was subsequently endorsed by the Food Advisory Committee (FAC) although the FAC also recommended that, as a precautionary measure, infant formulae manufacturersshould investigate ways to reduce the levels of phytoestrogens in soy-based infant formulae (MAFF,1996). In 1999, the Panel of Child and Maternal Nutrition (Committee on Medical Aspects of Food andNutrition Policy, 1999-2000) subsequently endorsed this recommendation. However, they noted that theclinical grounds for recommending a soy-based formula to parents were diminishing, as other moresuitable hydrolysates based on cows' milk were becoming available. New Zealand 16.5 In 1998, the Ministry of Health in New Zealand recommended that soy-based infant formula should only be used under the direction of a health professional for specific medical conditions including provencows' milk protein intolerance/ allergy, lactose intolerance, in the absence of soy proteinintolerance/ allergy, and galactosaemia.16. International policy on soy-based infant formulaCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 35816.6 It was also recommended that clinicians be made aware of the potential interaction between soy infant formula and thyroid function and that assessment of thyroid function should be considered ifsatisfactory growth and development is not achieved or maintained. It was also recommended cliniciansmonitor thyroxine replacement in infants with hypothyroidism, as these infants may require a higher thanusual dose of thyroxine to maintain a euthyroid state (New Zealand Ministry of Health, 1998). United States 16.7 In 1998, it was estimated that up to 25% of infants in the USA were fed soy-based infant formula. At this time, the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) recommended that soy-based formulae were a safeand effective alternative for infants if their nutritional needs were not being met by either breast milk orcows' milk formulae. The AAP also recommended the use of soy-based formula for infants withgalactosaemia, hereditary lactase deficiency or for infants whose parents were seeking a vegetarian orvegan diet. 16.8 However, the AAP recommend that soy-based infant formula not be routinely used for the prevention of either infantile colic or atopic disease. In addition, it recommended against feeding soy infant formulato infants with documented cows' milk protein-induced enteropathy or enterocolitis or to pre-terminfants under 1800 g (American Academy of Paediatrics, 1998). Republic of Ireland 16.9 In 1992, it was estimated that in Ireland 5% of infants aged between 3-9 months were being fed either a soy-based infant formula or a hydrolysate formula. In 1997, the Infant Feeding Sub-Committee ofthe Food Safety Advisory Board recommended that 'specialised' products such as soy-based infantformulae should only be fed to infants under medical supervision for the treatment of transient lactoseintolerance, galactosaemia and IgE mediated cows' milk allergy. 16.10 The Committee also suggested that soy-based infant formulae could be used as an alternative to breast milk or cows' milk formulae in infants whose parents wished to feed their child a vegetarian or vegandiet, although medical supervision was recommended in these cases to avoid the development ofnutritional deficiencies. 16.11 Soy-based infant formula was not recommended for routine use in infants as mineral absorption is less predictable and the precise physiological effect of high concentrations of aluminium andphytoestrogens from soybeans is unknown. In addition, the Committee recommended that soy infantformulae are not suitable for pre-term infants. Furthermore, the Committee recommended against usingsoy infant formula in cases of cows' milk protein induced enterocolitis or enteropathy. Nor did itrecommend the use of soy infant formula for the treatment of colic or as a preventive measure in atopicdisease (Food Safety Authority of Ireland, 1999).359Australia 16.12 The Australian College of Pediatrics (ACP) revised its Position Statement on soy infant formula in 1998 and recommended that the only conditions in infancy for which soy-based infant formula should be used aregalactosaemia and lactose intolerance. The ACP advised against the use of these formulae for infants withunproven symptoms of cows' milk protein intolerance or as a prophylactic in infants thought to be at risk ofdeveloping allergy (Australian College of Paediatrics, 1998). Canada 16.13 In 1998, it was estimated that 20% of infants in Canada were fed soy-based formulae either because of areal or perceived allergy to cows' milk protein. At this time the Joint Working Group of the Canadian PaediatricSociety, Dieticians of Canada and Health Canada issued a joint statement on nutrition for healthy term infantsfrom birth to 24 months of age, intended for use by health care professionals. They recommended that soy-based infant formulae be fed only to those infants who cannot be fed dairy-based products for health,cultural or religious reasons including galactosaemia or vegan lifestyle. Vegan infants who are not breast-fedand infants unable to take cows' milk products should continue to be fed commercial soy formula until 2 yearsof age. They recommended against the use of soy infant formula in the management of infants with an allergyto cows' milk protein or for the prevention of atopic diseases (Health Canada, 1998). Switzerland 16.14 In 1997, the Swiss Federal Commission on Food issued an information sheet directly to Pediatricians. TheCommission recommended that except for infants with lactose intolerance, galactosaemia andallergy/intolerance to cows' milk protein, soybean products should not be routinely used in food preparedfor healthy infants. In addition, the Commission recommended against the use of soy infant formula forideological or ethical reasons (Tonz & Zimmerli, 1997).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 360References American Academy of Paediatrics.

Phyto-oestrogens in baby food based on soya bean protein. Paediatricia. 1997, 8:14-15.361Chemistry of phytoestrogens 17.1 Phytoestrogens are natural constituents of many plants, seeds and grains and as such, they are present in many foodstuffs. The four principal groups of phytoestrogens found in food are the isoflavones,coumestans, prenylated flavonoids and lignans. 17.2 Measuring phytoestrogen concentrations in food and biological samples has proved difficult and reports on the content in foodstuffs have varied widely. The process has been further complicated by thefindings that species, strain and cultivation conditions can significantly influence the phytoestrogencontent. Although early studies used inadequate methods of analysis, these have improved as interest inthe compounds has grown. As such, the results from more recent studies are likely to be more reliable. 17.3 Current analytical methods combine chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry. However, until recently, they have been limited by the lack of suitable analytical standards. Standards for genistein anddaidzein have now been developed allowing accurate measurement of these compounds in foods andbiological matrices and these compounds have, by comparison to other phytoestrogens, been relativelywell studied. 17.4 In plants, notably soy, isoflavones are present as glucosides. Processing reduces the isoflavone content and can partially convert them to aglucones. The analysis of isoflavones as they appear in food has beenprecluded by the lack of suitable standards and concentrations are usually reported in terms of theaglucone. Analytical methods for phytoestrogens, other than the isoflavones, are less developed. Phytoestrogen intake 17.5 Comparison of estimated dietary isoflavone intakes in Western and Eastern (e.g. Japanese and Chinese) populations illustrate that Eastern populations have a significantly higher intake of phytoestrogens.These differences are generally attributed to the usage and higher consumption of soy and soy-basedfoods. Estimates suggest the average Japanese consumer is exposed to approximately 25-100 mgisoflavones/ day. There is only limited information on the consumption or concentrations ofphytoestrogens in the UK diet. Thus, the estimates of phytoestrogen intake are uncertain. Estimatesof isoflavone intake indicate an average UK consumer will ingest approximately 1 mg/person/ day.However, on the basis that a significant proportion of processed foods within the UK contain soyproducts, it is likely that this figure is an underestimate. 17.6 In addition, particular subgroups may have higher intakes of isoflavones than the average consumer. This may include infants fed soy-based infant formulae (approximately 40 mg isoflavones/ day), vegetariansconsuming and dairy-replacement foods (approximately isoflavones/ day).Consumers of dietary supplements or soy-rich diets are also expected to have higher isoflavoneexposures. Although intake estimates for these subgroups are currently unavailable, when considerationis made on a body weight basis, infants fed soy formula are likely to have the highest exposure toisoflavones (approximately 4 mg/kg bw/ day).17 . SummaryCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 36217.7 In 2002, figures published by the Department of Health estimated that in the UK, soy-based infant formulae are fed to approximately 1% of non-breast fed infants aged 4-10 weeks rising to approximately2% of infants aged 10-14 weeks. However, detailed information on the prevalence of, and reasons for, soy-based infant formula feeding is unavailable. In comparison, it has been estimated that this figure is asmuch as 25% in the US. Although soy has, for many centuries, played an integral part in some Eastern (e.g.Chinese and Japanese) cultures as a foodstuff, it is not generally fed to infants in the first 4-6 months oflife in these populations. Soy-based infant formula contains relatively high concentrations ofphytoestrogens (18-41 mg/L made up formula) and mean intakes are estimated at 4 mg/kg bw/ day,although other studies have indicated that consumption may be higher. The isoflavone content of humanbreast milk varies with maternal diet but the concentration is several orders of magnitude lower thanthat of soy formula fed infants (2-32 /H9262g/L for vegan/vegetarian mothers). Whereas, commercially available cows' milk-based formula contains almost undetectable levels of isoflavones. 17.8 Foods and dietary supplements rich in phytoestrogens are increasingly marketed on the basis of their potential health benefits. In 2000, the value of the European market for isoflavones was estimated to be\u00a364 million ( \u20ac106 million). Dietary supplements containing isoflavones are an expanding market and represent 9% of the phytonutrient market value. Research from market analysts predicts that thecombined phytonutrient market will increase to an estimated \u00a398 million ( \u20ac163 million) by 2008. Exposure through dietary supplementation could increase individual exposure. It is possible thatexposures from these sources may equate to those of infants fed soy-based infant formula for productsparticularly rich in phytoestrogens. Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of 17.9 Isoflavones lignans are ingested mainly as glucosides and undergo hydrolysis by gut bacterial and mammalian enzymes. The deglucosylated compounds may then undergo further metabolism by the gutbacteria prior to absorption or excretion. 17.10 There is considerable inter-individual variation in the pharmacokinetics, metabolism and bioavailability of ingested phytoestrogens, which can be attributed, at least in part, to differences in gut microflora.In turn, the microflora may be influenced by factors including diet, antibiotic use, disease and stress.Other potential factors that may influence inter-individual variations relate to food matrix, age, genderand metabolic polymorphisms. Inter-individual differences in the gut microflora-mediated conversion to the oestrogenic secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol toenterodiol and enterolactone, respectively have been reported. However, factors influencing thesepathways have not been elucidated. 17.11 The data suggest that isoflavones and lignans are extensively conjugated to glucuronides and sulfates in the liver. This inhibits their ability to bind to oestrogen receptors. As a consequence, the oestrogenicallyactive parent compounds are often relatively minor components in the blood. Isoflavones can alsoundergo enterohepatic recirculation.36317.12 The isoflavones and their metabolites are widely distributed within body fluids, although definitive tissue distribution studies have not been reported in humans. There is some evidence that placentaltransfer occurs during pregnancy in humans and concentrations similar to those in maternal plasma havebeen detected in umbilical cord plasma and amniotic fluid. 17.13 There is limited information on how phytoestrogens are handled in the newborn and infants. The pharmacokinetics of absorption in the neonate is unclear but it is likely to differ considerably from thatof the adult, particularly as the gut microflora in neonates is not fully developed. Data on the levels ofisoflavones in the blood of infants fed soy-based formula suggest that they can absorb isoflavones fromsuch formula. Oestrogenic activity of phytoestrogens 17.14 Phytoestrogens possess oestrogenic properties due to their structural similarities to the human hormone, oestradiol. Phytoestrogens may elicit their biological effects by binding to oestrogen receptors(ERs). Two oestrogen receptors, ER /H9251and ER /H9252, have been identified. The ERs display different tissue distribution patterns and can mediate differing biological effects. Phytoestrogens have been found tobind to both ERs although a number of phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, daidzein and coumestrol) appearto be more selective for ER /H9252. 17.15 Experimental studies suggest that phytoestrogens can also produce oestrogenic effects by modulating the concentrations of endogenous oestrogens. However, the evidence from in vivo studies for such mechanisms of action is limited. 17.16 The oestrogenic activity of phytoestrogens can be assessed by in vitro methods such as receptor binding, cellular proliferation and reporter gene assays. In vivo assays in animal models incorporate biological processes such as absorption and metabolism, which significantly influence oestrogenic potency. Thesemodels also incorporate mechanisms, which modulate the concentrations of endogenous oestrogens.For these reasons they provide a more holistic assessment of oestrogenic potency. 17.17 The relative oestrogenic potency of phytoestrogens is difficult to determine. However, if both in vitro and in vivo studies of phytoestrogen potency are taken together a rank phytoestrogens are much lower than those ofthe parent compounds.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 364Non-oestrogen receptor mediated effects of phytoestrogens 17.18 In vitro studies of phytoestrogens have indicated that they may have antioxidant properties and inhibit enzymes involved in the synthesis of thyroid hormones, as well as signal transduction, apoptosis, cellcycle and differentiation pathways. However, other than the inhibition of enzymes of thyroid hormonesynthesis, the concentrations of phytoestrogens required to act by many by these mechanisms in vitro do not equate to dietary exposure in humans. Human studies suggest that supplementation of the dietwith soy may produce antioxidant effects such as inhibition of LDL oxidation. However, these effectsmay not be attributable to the phytoestrogen content of soy. 17.19 There are limited data on the genotoxic potential of phytoestrogens. Studies have indicated that coumestrol and genistein may be genotoxic but at much higher concentrations than would be achievedin vivo from dietary exposure. A single study has investigated the in vivo mutagenicity of isoflavones. This study suggests that genistein at dietary levels is not mutagenic in vivo . Effects of phytoestrogens on fertility and development 17.20 Studies on the effects of phytoestrogens on human development and fertility are very difficult to conduct for ethical and practical reasons. Hence most of the published research has been conducted inlaboratory animals such as rodents and to a lesser extent in non-human primates. Significant speciesdifferences in sexual development and reproductive function between rodents, non-human primatesand humans make the interpretation of in vivo experimental studies to humans extremely difficult. 17.21 The rodent data indicate that coumestrol, and to a lesser extent isoflavones and lignans, produce oestrogenic effects in both male and female rodents but effects may be more pronounced in the femalerodent. Exposure during the neonatal, perinatal or prepubertal stages of development produce the mostmarked effects. 17.22 The rodent data on phytoestrogens are of limited use for risk assessment in humans as the significance of treatment-related alterations in end points such as advancement of vaginal opening and irregularoestrus cyclicity to humans is unclear. 17.23 Extrapolation of the data from rodent studies to humans is further complicated by the fact that the animal experiments have been carried out using much higher doses than are relevant to dietaryexposures in humans. Additionally, many studies use the subcutaneous route of administration, whichexcludes the critical influence of gastrointestinal and hepatic metabolism. 17.24 Primate studies are more applicable in terms of human risk assessment but few have been published. Recent research has addressed the effect of soy infant formula on the sexual development of soy-basedinfant formula fed male infant marmosets. This study is still in its initial stages but has shown that dietaryconsumption of soy-based infant formula reduces the neonatal surge in testosterone and increases thenumber of testosterone producing cells (Leydig cells) in the testes, compared with male marmosetinfants fed cows' milk formula. The human health implications of these results are unclear.36517.25 A single human study has specifically examined the effect of soy formula feeding on sexual development and fertility. The data do not provide evidence of obvious adverse clinical effects onsexual development or reproductive health of males and females, apart from small increases in theduration and discomfort of menstruation. However, this study was based on recall and did not involveany direct measurements of hormone levels or other parameters in the subjects. The effects of phytoestrogens on the thyroid gland 17.26 Goitrogenic effects in infants fed soy flour-based infant formula were reported when it was first introduced in the 1960s. This problem was subsequently overcome by using soy protein isolate insteadof soy flour thus, reducing the goitrogenic constituents of the formula and by supplementation of theformula with iodine. Since this change in processing and formulation there have been no reports of goitrein infants fed soy formula. Experimental data suggest that relatively high levels of dietary soy may havea goitrogenic effect in rodents deficient in dietary iodine. However, data from human studies suggest thatdietary soy or isoflavones is unlikely to affect thyroid function in normal individuals with adequateiodine intake. 17.27 It is possible that the isoflavone component of soy-based infant formula may have the capacity to inhibit thyroid function in infants. However, it has not been established whether the levels of freeisoflavones in the plasma of infants fed soy-based infant formula are sufficient to significantly influencethyroid function. 17.28 Due to the potential interactions between phytoestrogens and the thyroid gland, it is possible that the thyroid function of hypothyroid individuals consuming high levels of phytoestrogen- or goitrogen-richfoodstuffs and supplements may be adversely affected. In addition, there is a theoretical possibility thatunder circumstances in which the thyroid status of the mother is compromised, maternal exposure tohigh levels of phytoestrogens may impair normal development of the fetus. 17.29 Elevated levels of serum TSH, induced by goitrogens, have been associated with an increase in thyroid cancer in rodents. However, limited epidemiological evidence suggests that phytoestrogen exposure isnot associated with thyroid cancer risk. Effects of phytoestrogens on the central nervous system 17.30 Oestrogens are active in the central nervous system (CNS) and are thought to influence behaviour, movement, cognition, pain sensitivity, and protect against development of neurodegenerative diseases.Studies suggest the blood brain barrier effectively restricts phytoestrogen transfer to the CNS in adultrodents. However, despite this, relatively high dietary exposures to isoflavones in rodents have beenshown to alter protein concentrations and structures in the brain as well as induce behavioural effects.The implications of these findings to humans are unclear.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 36617.31 Two studies have investigated the effect of soy or isoflavones on cognitive function in humans. One, a retrospective study, shows a weak association between consumption of a soy-based food (tofu) in mid-life and cognitive impairment in later life. However, this study is reliant on the accuracy of the tofu intakedata and the results may have been influenced by inaccuracies resulting from the imprecise nature of themethodology employed. The other, a small placebo-controlled study, suggests relatively high short-termconsumption of high levels of isoflavones may slightly improve memory. Effects of phytoestrogens on the immune system 17.32 Oestrogens are involved in the development and maintenance of normal immune function. Rodent studies on the effects of isoflavones on immune function have produced inconsistent results, reportingstimulatory, suppressive or no effects on the immune system. The relevance of these observations forhuman health is uncertain. 17.33 One study of soy infant formula fed infants suggested isoflavones may adversely effect infant immunity. However, two more recent reports of a larger study indicate that there were no differences in immuneresponse between infants fed soy formula and those receiving breast milk. The effect of phytoestrogens on osteoporosis 17.34 Epidemiological studies indicate that bone mineral density is higher in populations consuming relatively large quantities of soy. Studies on rodent models of the menopause have consistently demonstrated thatsoy- or isoflavone-rich diets prevent bone loss. Dietary intervention studies in women have been short-term and limited in number. To date, the beneficial effects of phytoestrogens on bone mineral densityand bone mineral content in postmenopausal women have been small but statistically significant andconfined to the lumbar vertebrae, with the exception of one study that reported effects in the femoralneck and lumbar vertebrae. However, in short term studies, it is more likely that an effect will be seenon the spine, rather than the hip as the turnover of bone in the hip is slower than that in the spine. Nostudies have been performed in men. Large, long-term studies in humans would be required before theefficacy of phytoestrogen containing foods or supplements can be confirmed. Phytoestrogens and the cardiovascular system 17.35 Lower rates of coronary heart disease mortality have been reported in populations that traditionally consume soy (such as the Japanese) which led support to the suggestion that phytoestrogens may haveprotective effects against cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological and intervention studies provideevidence that dietary soy can have a hypocholesterolaemic effect in humans. Intervention studiesconducted in healthy and hypercholesterolemic subjects, with pure isoflavones have producedinconsistent results. Therefore, it is not possible to attribute the hypocholesterolaemic effect of soy toits phytoestrogen content. The effects of phytoestrogens on other factors important in the risk ofcardiovascular disease such as blood pressure, thrombosis or atherosclerosis has not been extensivelyinvestigated. There is some limited evidence that flaxseed can have a hypocholesterolaemic effect.367Phytoestrogen modulation of endogenous hormones 17.36 Most data from studies investigating the effect of dietary supplementation of soy or isoflavones suggest that isoflavones produce weak oestrogenic effects in postmenopausal women. However, data onwhether such supplementation provides relief from menopausal symptoms are inconsistent. Althoughstudies have suggested soy may be beneficial in alleviating menopausal symptoms, especially if basalintake is low, or symptoms severe, the data are equivocal, as positive results are often not statisticallysignificant and strong placebo responses are observed. Thus, at present, the weight of evidence does notstrongly support the suggestions that soy or phytoestrogens alleviate menopausal symptoms. The poorpenetration of isoflavones across the blood brain barrier may mitigate against centrally mediatedmodulation of endogenous hormone concentrations to reduce the number and severity of hot flushes. 17.37 It has been suggested that phytoestrogens may be protective against the potentially harmful effects of endogenous oestrogens (e.g. oestrogen-dependent breast cancer) by lengthening the menstrual cyclethus, reducing the lifetime exposure of women to these compounds. Data from studies onpremenopausal women suggest that supplementation of the diet with soy or isoflavones may produceweak hormonal effects. However, the hormonal effects reported are inconsistent and few studies reportincreases in menstrual cycle length with dietary supplementation. 17.38 Reports of hormonal effects of dietary soy or isoflavone supplementation on men are inconsistent, showing either no or only weak oestrogenic effects. 17.39 It has been suggested that phytoestrogens may have a beneficial effect on some factors of diabetes. An intervention trial indicates that relatively high levels of dietary soy may improve some aspects ofdiabetes in postmenopausal women with type II diabetes. However, there may be factors in soy otherthan phytoestrogens, which aid glycaemic control. No studies have specifically looked at the effect ofphytoestrogens on diabetes although an in vitro study suggests that genistein may increase insulin secretion by pancreatic cells. The relevance of these latter observations to humans is unknown. The role of phytoestrogens in cancer 17.40 The incidence of a number of cancers, including those of the breast and prostate, has been found to be much higher in Western populations compared with that in Eastern countries such as Japan and China.Epidemiological and migrant studies have suggested that the relatively high consumption of soy-basedproducts amongst Eastern populations may play a role in the aetiology of these diseases. However, theinterpretation of epidemiological studies is complicated also by a number of confounding factors,including differences in lifestyle and diet and are constrained by the paucity of data on phytoestrogenconcentrations in foods and dietary intakes. 17.41 It has been suggested that exposure to oestrogen during development or early life may play an important role in programming hormonal homeostasis and influence an individuals later life risk of developingcancer. Few human studies on cancer have addressed the possibility that exposure to phytoestrogens atan earlier life stage or over several life stages may confer protective changes. This possibility may, inpart, explain why the reduced risk of certain cancers observed amongst migrants increases withsubsequent generations.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 368Breast cancer 17.42 Most epidemiological studies have investigated soy rather than individual phytoestrogens in breast cancer. Of these, the majority of case control studies have shown a protective trend for soy foods,particularly in Asian women, but results from two prospective studies are conflicting. Studies usingbiomarkers of phytoestrogen intake have shown some protective effects of lignans, and case controlstudies have also suggested protective effects of isoflavones. There are no prospective studies in whichaccurate assessments of food intake and biomarkers of exposure to all phytoestrogens are available sothere are insufficient data on which to confirm a causal association. 17.43 It is suggested that a reduction in lifetime exposure to oestrogen may lower the risk of breast cancer. The lower rates of breast cancer in Japanese and Chinese women have been associated with longer menstrualcycles which in turn has been associated with a soy-rich diet. The effects of phytoestrogens onmenstrual cycle length have been investigated but current evidence suggests it is not possible toattribute alterations in menstrual cycle to phytoestrogen intake. 17.44 The majority of the epidemiological studies on breast cancer have examined the effects of soy rather than phytoestrogens specifically. Most studies report an inverse association between risk and soyconsumption or excretion. However, some studies do not support such an association. Specific studieson the effects of phytoestrogens are also inconsistent. 17.45 In one study, short-term dietary supplementation has been shown to induce a weak oestrogenic effect in premenopausal women with breast disease as shown by modulation of the levels of the oestrogenresponsive gene products apolipoprotein D and pS2 in nipple aspirate. However, no effect on breast cellproliferation was evident. 17.46 The animal data on breast cancer is conflicting. A number of studies have shown that genistein has a protective effect in animal models of chemically induced cancer. However, similar experiments usingtumour implant models showed that genistein stimulated the growth of implanted mammary tumoursboth by dietary and subcutaneous administration. Studies in animal models with chemically inducedmammary cancer suggest that dietary supplementation with the lignan, secoisolariciresinol may have achemoprotective effect on breast cancer development although the results are not consistent. Animalstudies suggest that exposure to phytoestrogens in early life inhibits development of breast cancer laterin life. Endometrial and ovarian cancer 17.47 Limited epidemiological evidence does not allow direct associations between phytoestrogen intake and endometrial or ovarian cancer risk to be made. Prostate cancer 17.48 Epidemiological data from studies investigating the effect of soy intake on prostate cancer report inconsistent results. One study has shown an increased risk of prostate cancer is associated with the369intake of fermented soy foods such as miso. Other studies report either no effect or an inverse correlation with consumption of non-fermented soy foods. Only one study has specifically investigatedphytoestrogens and found an association with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. 17.49 Research in rodents has specifically examined the effects of phytoestrogens on models of prostate disease. Generally, these studies have shown a protective effect either in tumour implant or chemicallyinduced models of cancer. However, the concentrations used in these experiments are very highcompared to likely dietary exposure levels in humans in the UK. 17.50 In vitro experiments have shown that phytoestrogens can modulate components of the cell cycle pathway and inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells and stimulate apoptosis. However, these effects were only foundto occur at much higher concentrations than would be expected from normal dietary intakes. Colorectal cancer 17.51 Epidemiological data suggests that consumption of non-fermented soy may lower the risk of colorectal cancer. In contrast, fermented soy products are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.These studies have looked only at soy or soy products and no studies have specifically examined theeffects of phytoestrogens. Experimental research in animal models have reported inconsistent results forisoflavones but the studies on lignans in animals appear more consistent, showing an inverse associationbetween lignan consumption and risk of colorectal cancer. Stomach cancer 17.52 Studies in humans have shown an inconsistent relationship between soy consumption and the risk of stomach cancer. However, as with colorectal data, an increased risk has most often been associated withthe consumption of fermented soy products, whereas protective effects have been associated with theconsumption of unfermented soy products. In contrast, animal studies suggest fermented soy productseither significantly inhibit or have no effect on the number of experimentally induced tumours. Only onestudy has examined the effects of phytoestrogens and showed that genistein significantly reduced theincidence of experimentally induced gastric cancer. Lung cancer 17.53 A single study has investigated the effect of phytoestrogens in lung cancer. This study showed that isoflavone consumption was weakly associated with a reduction in lung cancer risk in a Chinesepopulation. Other published studies in Chinese populations, which examined the effects of soy ratherthan phytoestrogens also reported an inverse association between soy consumption and the risk of lungcancer. Animal data have shown that genistein can inhibit development of experimentally induced lungtumours and genistein and secoisolariciresinol may inhibit experimentally induced metastasis ofmelanoma cells to the lung.37118.1 The remit of the Working Group was to review phytoestrogens generally, rather than soy, specifically. However, the Working Group did consider the literature on soy to ensure inclusion of all relevantinformation. 18.2 Phytoestrogens are biologically active when administered to animals and humans and have been shown to elicit their effects via a number of mechanisms: Interaction with oestrogen receptors (ER) to modulate the expression of oestrogen-responsive genes 15. Inhibition of enzymes involved in oestrogen biosynthesis and metabolism. Modulation of thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Inhibition of protein kinases and interaction with components of the cell cycle as well as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis pathways. Inhibition of topoisomerase. Antioxidant reactions. Evaluation of risks and benefits of dietary phytoestrogens 18.3 Evaluation of the public health implications of phytoestrogens is complex as these compounds can elicit agonist and antagonist actions via the oestrogen receptor and non-oestrogenic effects, which are age,tissue and gender dependent. There are also significant inter-species differences in ADME and timing ofsexual development making extrapolation of the effects seen in animals to humans complex. 18.4 Many of the reports on the benefits of consuming phytoestrogens are based upon observations in Eastern populations such as the Japanese and Chinese that have traditionally consumed soy.In addition, suggestions that dietary phytoestrogens do not pose significant health risks have beenattributed to the lack of reports of adverse effects in these populations. However, it is uncertain whetherdata from Eastern populations can be extrapolated to Western populations, as there may be differencesin how phytoestrogens are handled between such populations. 15Some of the mechanisms outlined hereafter may also be dependent on ER activity.18. ConclusionsCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 37218.5 Given the level of complexity the Working Group considered it inappropriate to evaluate the public health implications of phytoestrogens to the population as a whole or communicate the implications ina single statement. 18.6 An evaluation of the risks and benefits of dietary phytoestrogens is critically dependent on the nature, timing, conditions and extent of exposure. However, currently detailed intake data for the UK populationas a whole, or for specific subgroups of consumers, is very limited. 18.7 In vitro studies suggest that at physiological concentrations, interactions with oestrogen receptors are the primary cause of biological effects. In vivo studies support this view, as the principal biological effects observed on administration of phytoestrogens are similar to those of oestrogen and can beblocked by ER antagonists. Many experimental studies have used subcutaneous administration, whichcan significantly influence the biological activity of phytoestrogens. In addition, these studies, for themost part, use high concentrations of phytoestrogens. This makes interpretation difficult, as theseexperimental conditions are not equivalent to the level of dietary exposure in humans. 18.8 Many studies have used phytoestrogen-containing foods such as soy or flaxseed as a test material and assumed that phytoestrogens are responsible for the biological effects seen. However, it is impossible toexclude the possibility that there are other active components in these foods that could also contributeto the effects observed. Most research in the phytoestrogen field has focused on the isoflavones andthus, comparatively little is known about the prenylated flavonoids, coumestrol and lignans. Currentanalyses suggest that there are very few sources of prenylated flavonoids or coumestrol in the diet.However, the lignans are relatively common. Does ingestion of soy-based infant formula pose any risk for human infants? 18.9 In the UK, soy-based infant formulae have been used since the 1960s and are currently fed to approximately 1% of non-breast fed infants aged 4-10 weeks rising to approximately 2% of infants aged10-14 weeks. However, detailed information on the prevalence of, and reasons for, soy-based infantformula feeding is unavailable. 18.10 The concentration of phytoestrogens found in soy-based infant formulae is several orders of magnitude higher than that found in human breast milk. It has been estimated that intake by infants of isoflavonesfrom soy-based formulae is approximately 4 mg/kg body weight/ day. The Working Group concluded that infants fed soy-based formulae are the population subgroup exposed to the highest concentrationsof isoflavones and that exposure via breast milk is low by comparison. No data on the transfer of lignansfrom the maternal diet to breast milk have been published. 18.11 There is little published information to suggest that isoflavones affect thyroid function in infants fed soy- based formulae. However, the Working Group considered that isoflavones may lower free thyroxine concentrations. Although a normally functioning thyroid may compensate for this, by stimulatingthyroxine production, it is possible that infants with congenital hypothyroidism may be unable to373increase thyroxine production. These individuals may represent a small susceptible subgroup of the population, therefore the Working Group recommends that physicians and other health care workers are made aware of the potential interactions between isoflavones in soy-based infant formulae and thyroidfunction. The Working Group advise that it is appropriate to monitor thyroxine levels in infants with congenital hypothyroidism who are fed soy-based infant formulae in order to establish the susceptibilityof this subgroup. 18.12 Few studies have examined the effect of isoflavones on the immune system. Studies in rodents have suggested that isoflavones may alter some parameters of immune function but the effects wereinconsistent. However, the Working Group considered that investigations of human infants fed soy-based formulae provide reassurance that phytoestrogens in soy do not have a significant impact on theintegrity of immune function in such children. 18.13 A recent study conducted in male neonatal marmosets suggests that feeding with soy-based infant formulae can alter some parameters of reproductive health during the neonatal stage. The WorkingGroup acknowledged that this work is still in progress, and therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made about likely human health implications. The Working Group advise that future findings from this work be evaluated fully once it has been completed. 18.14 Only a single study specifically examining the long-term health effects of soy-based formula feeding on sexual development and fertility in humans has been published. The Working Group considered that these data do not provide definite evidence for adverse clinical effects on sexual development or reproductivehealth, but noted the association between soy-based formula feeding and small increases in the duration and discomfort of menstruation. However, the study was based on recall and did not include any directmeasurements of hormone levels or other parameters in the subjects. The Working Group acknowledged that it was difficult to draw general conclusions from the results of a single study. 18.15 The Working Group considered that the findings from these studies do not provide definitive evidence that phytoestrogens present in soy-based infant formulae can adversely affect the health of infants.However, the findings, together with those from studies on the mechanism of action and biologicalactivity of phytoestrogens reviewed in this Report, provide evidence of potential risks. For this reason,the Working Group expressed concern about the use of soy-based infant formulae. The Working Group noted that the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) expressed similar concern when considering evidence presented in this Report. SACN also considered there to be no substantive medical need for, nor health benefit arising from, the use of soy-based infant formulae. However, it was noted that soy-based infant formulae were the only vegan infant formula option available if babies were notexclusively breast fed 16. In light of the concerns expressed, the Working Group recommends that the Department of Health review current advice on the use of soy-based infant formulae. 16Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition response to the COT Working Group on Phytoestrogens draft report on phytoestrogens & health (2003).Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 374Are there health implications for other subgroups of the population? 18.16 The Working Group considered that it was of more value to identify and characterise health implications in specific population groups rather than provide an overall evaluation for the general population. Atpresent, there are only limited data on the intake of phytoestrogens by specific population groups in theUK. However, those consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may ingest larger amounts of soy, anassumption supported by what intake data are available. The Working Group has identified a number ofpopulation subgroups that may be expected to have a higher than average intake of phytoestrogens: Vegetarians and vegans (isoflavones and lignans). Particular ethnic groups e.g. Japanese and Chinese (isoflavones). Consumers of soy-based foods (isoflavones). Consumers of phytoestrogen-containing dietary supplements (mostly isoflavones). 18.17 The Working Group noted the possibility that exposure among these subgroups will vary due to the large inter-individual differences in metabolism and bioavailability of phytoestrogens and in particular,differences in gut microflora. Specific gut microflora are responsible for the conversion of daidzein tothe more potent oestrogen, equol. Thus, equol-producing individuals would be expected to be exposedto a greater oestrogenic potential than non-equol producers. 18.18 Dietary supplements containing phytoestrogens and soy-enriched foods are commercially available and are promoted as having beneficial health effects on human health. Phytoestrogen supplements aremarketed as 'natural' alternative treatments for a range of conditions including the menopause,osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and a number of cancers. Specific marketing for these conditionsmay lead to increased consumption within certain population subgroups adding significantly toconsumer exposure. However, at present, it is not possible to estimate the impact on the consumerexposure, as few data on the phytoestrogen concentrations in or consumption patterns of theseproducts are available. 18.19 Isoflavones and lignans can cross the placenta after metabolism in the mother. However, it is not known how the fetus metabolises these compounds and there are no published human studies examining thepotential effects of in utero exposure to phytoestrogens. Therefore the implications of this exposure are unclear. The Working Group advise that further research be conducted to examine the implications of consuming a phytoestrogen-rich diet during pregnancy.37518.20The Working Group identified individuals with hypothyroidism as a subgroup of potential concern. Consumption of phytoestrogen supplements, or a soy-rich diet, may provide sufficient concentrationsof phytoestrogens to interfere with thyroxine replacement therapy. Although no adverse effects inhypothyroid children or adults have been reported in the published literature, the Working Grouprecognised that research had not addressed this issue specifically. In view of the increasing availability of phytoestrogen-rich food and supplements in the UK, the Working Group recommends that research is conducted to monitor the plasma thyroxine levels of children and adults with hypothyroidism whoconsume large quantities of dietary phytoestrogens. 18.21 The Working Group also acknowledged the theoretical possibility that under circumstances in which the thyroid status of the mother is compromised, maternal exposure to high levels of phytoestrogens mayimpair normal development of the fetus. The Working Group recommends research is carried out to address this issue. 18.22 Despite the suggested benefits of phytoestrogens in lowering the risks of developing breast cancer, a study has shown that soy supplementation of the diet can induce oestrogen-responsive gene productsin nipple aspirates in premenopausal women with breast disease. Although breast cell proliferation wasnot evident in this study, the Working Group suggested that until further research is carried out, women with oestrogen-dependent breast disease should be cautious in supplementing their diet withphytoestrogen-rich foods or dietary supplements. However, the Working Group considered that the data are insufficient to allow a quantitative recommendation so far as the phytoestrogen intake of thispopulation subgroup is concerned. 18.23 The Working Group considered an epidemiological study that suggested an association between high levels of consumption of soy-based foods and decreased cognitive function in a group of Japanese-American men and women. The Working Group concluded that this report did not provide sufficient evidence to confirm this association as the report lacked sufficient detail and the associations may haveresulted from inaccuracies in the methods employed. Evidence for beneficial effects of dietary phytoestrogens 18.24 Epidemiological data suggests a soy-rich diet is associated with a reduction in the risk of a number of conditions, including certain hormone-dependent diseases. However, the Working Group considered many of these studies to be of limited value because they do not address specifically the roles ofphytoestrogens. Any reported effects from such research therefore cannot be attributed with certaintyto phytoestrogens, as other biologically active components may be causally responsible for the effectsobserved. 18.25 In addition, many of the studies were short-term intervention studies in adults that did not address the possibility that exposure to phytoestrogens at an earlier age may influence the risk of disease later in life.Furthermore, a significant proportion of the research has been conducted in populations such as theJapanese and Chinese and thus, extrapolation of these results to the UK population may be confoundedby differences in lifestyle, diet, gut microflora, genetic make-up and ADME.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 376Menopausal symptoms 18.26 Studies examining the effect of soy-based products or isoflavones to relieve menopausal symptoms are inconclusive. Some studies have suggested that soy may be beneficial, especially if basal intake is low, orthe vasomotor symptoms severe, but the data are equivocal, as positive results are often not statisticallysignificant and strong placebo responses are observed. Osteoporosis 18.27 Clinical data on the effects of phytoestrogens on bone density are limited but results of short-term human studies suggest small protective effects in the lumbar spine. The data for protective effects atother sites are equivocal. However, studies using rodent models of the menopause have consistentlydemonstrated that soy- or isoflavone-rich diets prevent bone loss. Large, long-term intervention studiesare required to evaluate these effects in humans. Cardiovascular disease 18.28 There is a considerable body of evidence to indicate that consumption of soy can have beneficial effects on low-density lipoproteins and total cholesterol levels. There have been attempts to attribute theseeffects to the isoflavones in soy. However, purified isoflavones appear not to produce the samebeneficial effects, and there is little evidence to suggest that this effect is associated with the isoflavonecomponent of soy. The Working Group noted that the US Food and Drug Administration reached similar conclusions when examining this issue. The effects of phytoestrogens on other factors important in therisk of cardiovascular disease such as blood pressure, thrombosis or atherosclerosis have not beenextensively investigated. 18.29 There is very little epidemiological data on lignans and cardiovascular disease. Such studies would be extremely difficult to design and conduct due to the prevalence of these compounds in fruitand vegetables. Cancer 18.30 The Working Group concluded that there is some evidence for beneficial effects of phytoestrogens on the development of breast and prostate cancer based upon animal experiments. The findings inhumans are less convincing. This may be due, in part, to the much higher doses used in the animal studies.The interpretation of epidemiological studies is complicated by a number of confounding factors,including differences in lifestyle and diet and is constrained by the paucity of data on dietary intakes ofphytoestrogens. 18.31 It has been suggested that exposure to oestrogens or phytoestrogens during development in utero , in infancy or in childhood may play an important role in the programming of hormonal homeostasis andinfluence the risk of developing cancer later in life. This may, in part, explain why the relatively low riskof certain cancers observed among migrant populations from the East (e.g. Chinese and Japanese)increases in subsequent generations. The Working Group recommends that in order to establish the clinical efficacy of phytoestrogens in these conditions in humans, long-term studies shouldbe undertaken.377Breast cancer 18.32 Studies examining the effect of isoflavones on breast cancer incidence are inconclusive. Prospective studies have failed to show significant associations between ingestion of soy or isoflavones and breastcancer incidence. Dietary intervention studies, using phytoestrogen supplements, have indicated changesin biomarkers that may be associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. Endometrial and ovarian cancer 18.33 A small number of studies have investigated the effects of phytoestrogens in these conditions and to date there is no evidence to support the suggestion that phytoestrogens have protective effects on theincidence of endometrial or ovarian cancer. Prostate cancer 18.34 Studies investigating the relationship between phytoestrogens and human prostate cancer are too few to draw conclusions and are limited to studies of soy. Experimental studies in rodents show that dietssupplemented with soy or isoflavones may inhibit the development of tumours of the prostate. Colorectal cancer 18.35 Epidemiological data suggests that consumption of non-fermented soy may lower the risk of colorectal cancer. In contrast, fermented soy products are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.No studies have specifically examined the effects of phytoestrogens. Data from rodent studies areconflicting and there is no firm evidence to suggest that phytoestrogens have beneficial effects on theincidence of colon cancer. Stomach cancer 18.36 The evidence for protective effects of soy or isoflavones on stomach cancer in humans is inconclusive. Studies in Japanese and Chinese populations have shown higher rates of stomach cancer associated withfermented soy products. However, the high salt concentrations in such foods may contribute to thishigher incidence in these populations. Lung cancer 18.37 Epidemiological studies examining associations between phytoestrogen or soy intake and lung cancer in Chinese populations are inconclusive.Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 378Recommendations for future research 18.38 The Working Group recommends further research to address important outstanding issues and to aid future risk assessment of dietary phytoestrogens. The Working Group considered that future research should be conducted in humans where possible. The following research priorities were identified. Detailed exposure studies of discrete populations in the UK who ingest relatively large amounts of phytoestrogens, such as infants, vegetarians/vegans and users of phytoestrogen-rich foods andsupplements, would allow a more informed view of the health implications of phytoestrogens. TheWorking Group recommends that research examining the phytoestrogen content of food, as well as intakes of, and systemic exposure to, phytoestrogens is conducted. The extent and nature of soy-based infant formula use in the UK is uncertain. The Working Group recommends research to address these areas. The Working Group considers there is a need for further research on the potential effects of phytoestrogens in infants fed soy-based infant formulae. It may be possible to use established cohortsof infants fed soy-based formula to investigate the possible long-term health effects of exposure tophytoestrogens during infancy. The Working Group considers there is a need to investigate the potential interaction of phytoestrogens with the thyroid gland in subjects with compromised thyroid function. The Working Group recommends that further research be conducted to establish whether phytoestrogens act mainly by oestrogen receptor-mediated mechanisms or by alternative mechanisms. Large long-term prospective studies are necessary to establish the relationship between dietary phytoestrogens and the development of some diseases, specifically osteoporosis, breast cancer andprostate cancer. Shorter intervention studies are required to assess effects on menopausal symptomsand risk markers of diseases, such as osteoporosis and cancers. Such studies should consider anevaluation of the role of metabolites, especially equol, in the biological effects observed. The Working Group also identified supplementary areas for future research. The health implications of in utero exposure to phytoestrogens are unclear. There is a need for research to examine what effects maternal exposure to phytoestrogens may have on the fetus and onsubsequent health status of the child. The potential for drug-phytoestrogen interactions has not been established. This is of potential importance for individuals consuming phytoestrogen dietary supplements while taking prescribeddrugs with hormonal effects. The potential differences in the metabolism of phytoestrogens between Western and Eastern populations has not been determined. Knowledge of the potential differences would aid assessmentof epidemiological studies.379Glossary of terms and abbreviations Aberrant crypt foci Pre-cancerous lesions of the colon.
