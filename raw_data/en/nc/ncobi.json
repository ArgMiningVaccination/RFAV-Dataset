In the present study we explore the experiences of vaccine-related and alternative treatments of autistic individuals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with autistic adults (n = 3), parents of autistic children (n = 5) and parents of autistic adults (n = 5). Thematic analysis showed five themes: (1) reasons for choosing alternative treatment, (2) treatment content, (3) experiences with alternative care, (4) outcomes of the vaccine-related treatment and (5) future directions for treating autism. Both positive (holistic approach, time and attention) and negative aspects (false claims about vaccines and curability of autism) were found. Improved support and guidelines could reduce ineffective and harmful alternative treatments for autism. was supported by a ZonMW Research grant (The Netherlands) [ 636340005 ], by the Senior Research Advancement Fund/Research Development Allowance, School of Law, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Faculty of Business and Social Sciences, Kingston University, UK and by funding from the Ministry of Health , wellbeing and sports in the Netherlands 16-4067-26061 .
