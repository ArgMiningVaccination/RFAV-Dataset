By now you've met with an orthopaedic surgeon* and set a date for your joint replacement surgery. From this point on, the orthopaedic care team will be with you every step of the way. We look forward to giving you excellent care and service. Two important things to do before your surgery are to read this book and attend a Joint Adventures class. The information in this book, plus much more, will be covered in detail during the class. Knowing what to do before your surgery and what to expect afterwards can help reduce the stress or fear you might have. Besides reading this book and attending a class, you may also be advised to watch a web-based Emmi\u00ae education program about your joint surgery. Your surgeon's* office can provide you with the web address and access code you'll need to view the video. Please contact your surgeon's* office for this information. Most of the questions you might have today should be answered after reading this book, watching the Emmi video and attending a Joint Adventures class. If you still have questions about your surgery schedule, physician appointments or medication, please call your physician's/surgeon's* office. For other questions, please contact me directly using my cell phone number listed below. Again, welcome to Kishwaukee Hospital and Valley West Hospital. The orthopaedic care team looks forward to helping make your joint adventure a pleasant one.Welcome to Northwestern Medicine TTY for the hearing impaired: Kishwaukee Hospital, 815.766.9736; Valley West Hospital, 815.981.7313 *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates.

Femur Patella Ligament Tibia FibulaTo help you better understand the process of knee replacement, it may be helpful to know more about your knee and how it works. The ability to walk easily depends on the specific way the thigh bone (femur) meets the shin bone (tibia). These bones are separated by cartilage, which acts as a cushion and allows movement. In front of these bones, the kneecap (patella) glides in a groove and provides a round, protective shield. Much of the knee's stability and its main movements of bending and straightening depend on surrounding muscles and ligaments.Getting started7Joint Adventures Getting Started Worn, cracked cartilage Rough weight- bearing surfaces Bone spurs Narrowed joint space *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates. They have selected our facilities as places where they want to treat and care for their private patients.Arthritis The word \"arthritis\" means joint inflammation. Arthritis of the knee is a disease that wears away the cartilage of the knee joint. Without enough cartilage, the femur and the tibia rub on each other\u2014bone on bone. When this happens, the joint becomes pitted and rough. The result is pain, stiffness and instability. Osteoarthritis, often referred to as degenerative joint disease, usually gets worse with time. It is most common in people over age 50, but can occur at any age. Large, weight-bearing joints, such as the hip and knee, are the most common joints affected by osteoarthritis. People with osteoarthritis often get bone spurs around the joint. This can make it hard to move. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease that attacks any part of the body\u2014including joints. In rheumatoid arthritis, the joint fluid contains chemical substances that attack and damage the joint surface. Swelling, pain and stiffness are usually present even when the joint is not used.Knee replacement Knee replacement surgery removes damaged and worn parts of the knee and replaces them with artificial parts called prostheses. This makes the knee strong, stable and flexible again. The protheses include the same basic parts as your own knee. The femoral component is inserted into the thigh bone. The tibial component is inserted into the top of the shin bone. The patellar component replaces the kneecap. The new joint may be secured in two ways. The cemented method secures the knee joint in place using acrylic bone cement that sets within 15 minutes. The uncemented, or ingrowth, method allows the new joint to be secured into place by the body's own bone growth. The decision about which method you will have should be discussed with your surgeon.*Arthritis Knee replacement8However, you need to take a few more to ensure you, your home and your caregiver are fully prepared for your joint replacement surgery. During the next few days and weeks, you will need to: Register and attend a pre-operative knee replacement class at the hospital. Watch educational internet programs as assigned by your physician*. Prepare your home for your return. Complete and return the Care Coordination Form. Complete lab work or other tests ordered by your physicians*. Select a support person to assist you at home for the first week after surgery.Pre-operative class The pre-operative class and this book were created to help patients and family members better understand what to expect before and after joint replacement surgery. Steps to prepare for the pre-operative class 1. Bring this book with you to class and to the hospital the day of your surgery. 2. Select a family member or close friend who can be your \"support person\" (coach); your support person will need to attend the pre-operative class with you to learn and understand how to assist you. 3. Register for class 2 to 6 weeks prior to your surgery by calling Pre-op Nursing at 815.766.9093. TTY for the hearing impaired: Kishwaukee Hospital, 815.766.9736; Valley West Hospital, 815.981.7313. Prior to your surgery, we recommend you watch any web- based programs that have been assigned to you.Congratulations. You've taken the first step to regaining your active lifestyle.Joint Adventures Getting Started *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates. They have selected our facilities as places where they want to treat and care for their private patients.9 Preparing for Surgery10 Joint Adventures Preparing for Surgery Physician visits and lab tests Before surgery, most patients will complete an evaluation that may include a pre-operative physical exam, lab tests, EKG and X-rays. Please be sure to speak with a pre-admission review nurse before you go for testing; anesthesia guidelines may call for additional tests. Your physician* also may discuss temporarily stopping the use of some medications, such as aspirin or other anti- inflammatory medications, about 1 week prior to surgery. These medications tend to make your blood thinner and could cause more bleeding during your surgery. Dental care before surgery Any invasive dental work, including routine cleanings, cavity filling, extractions, root canals or implant work, can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream. If you are scheduled to have dental work within the 6 weeks prior to your joint replacement surgery, please tell your surgeon's* office staff. Your surgeon* may provide specific instructions or guidelines for you to follow. Consult your surgeon* regarding the length of time to wait after surgery before scheduling any future dental appointments. Infection prevention Infection is a rare complication of joint replacement surgery. If you have any signs or symptoms of infection prior to surgery, such as an open sore, flu symptoms, a cut, infected teeth or a bladder infection, tell your physician* immediately. Your surgery may need to be delayed until you receive appropriate treatment. While in the hospital, you will receive antibiotics before and after surgery to reduce your risk of infection. If you have any signs or symptoms of infection prior to surgery, tell your physician* immediately.Joint replacement is an elective surgery. Therefore, it is important that your state of health be evaluated thoroughly prior to undergoing the procedure.Preparing for surgery *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates. They have selected our facilities as places where they want to treat and care for their private patients.11Joint Adventures Preparing for Surgery Your incision needs to be kept clean and dry until it is healed. Your new joint is artificial and does not have your body's natural protection against infection, so it is possible to develop an infection years later. Bacteria can enter your bloodstream and invade your new joint causing it to become loose and painful. Call your physician* immediately if you experience signs or symptoms of infection such as fever, chills, pain, redness or drainage. Common infections include sore throat, urinary tract infection, deep cuts or an ear infection. Your physician* may prescribe antibiotics. Health history Once you have a confirmed surgery date, you will need to provide a complete health history. One of our experienced pre-admission nurses will call you to obtain your detailed health history. After the phone interview, you will be given instructions for the next steps, such as what tests will be performed and where to go for testing. Based on your history, required testing will be scheduled at Kishwaukee Hospital or Valley West Hospital.Pre-op Nursing at Kishwaukee Hospital and Valley West Hospital You will meet with a member of our pre-admission nursing team. One of our nurses will draw blood for labs and other testing, if required. The nurse will provide any pre-operative education. The Pre-op Nursing visit also provides you the opportunity to ask questions in person and become familiar with the hospital before surgery. *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates.

Calcium carbonate is the least expensive supplement and it contains the highest amount of calcium per tablet. Calcium carbonate is available under the brand names OS Cal\u00ae and Caltrate\u00ae or generic calcium carbonate. Calcium also can be found in Tums\u00ae, an over-the-counter antacid. The ingredient label on the back of the product lists the calcium content. Your body only can accept 500 mg of calcium at a time, so do not take more than that in one serving. Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a disorder where bone becomes weak and brittle. People with osteoporosis have an increased risk for broken bones. Osteoporosis may develop if your body doesn't get enough calcium.

You can progress to solid food when you and your surgeon* feel you are ready. You will have intravenous (IV) fluids for 1 to 2 days after surgery. You will receive antibiotics, fluids and blood, if needed, through your IV. Visitors On the day of surgery, we suggest that you keep visitors to a minimum and limit the amount of time they stay. You will feel very drowsy from the medications. Privacy To protect your privacy after surgery, you will be requested to communicate directly with your family and friends regarding your condition. You will be asked to choose a password to protect your privacy if you are unable to update your family/friends yourself. Please advise family and friends they will need to provide the password to a nurse in order to obtain updates on your condition.

They will check the color, movement and sensation in your legs. They will orient you to your new environment, where: A nurse will create a personalized plan of care to meet your individual needs and work with other members of the orthopaedic care team. A patient care technician will assist you with activities of daily living such as bathing, turning in bed and toileting Inpatient physical therapy Physical therapy is one of the most important parts of your recovery. You will most likely begin physical therapy the day of your surgery. As an inpatient, you will receive physical therapy twice a day. Your surgeon* and the rehabilitation services staff work together to develop an individualized therapy plan for you. You are encouraged to take pain medication on a regular basis while hospitalized. It is important to have adequate pain management to complete your rehabilitation. During your therapy sessions, you will be instructed in exercises to help restore joint motion and strengthen the surrounding muscles. As you become stronger and progress toward your mobility goal, you will learn and practice how to: Properly move and turn in bed Get in and out of bed and chairs Walk and climb stairs \u2014 if appropriate to your home setting Therapy after your discharge will be based on your health status, abilities and the mobility level you achieved in the hospital. Your focus should be to work toward your optimal functional level with your home health therapist. *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates.

If necessary, your surgeon* may request a catheter be inserted to drain your urine. Constipation can become another problem several days after surgery. Drink a lot of fluids and eat foods that are high in fiber. A stool softener and laxatives may be given to you.Incision care Your incision will be covered by a dressing. Your wound must be kept clean, dry and covered. Wound care will be discussed before discharge. Respiratory care Secretions tend to pool in the lungs and can lead to pneumonia. To prevent this, we will teach you to breathe deeply and cough, as well as how to use an incentive spirometer, which is a breathing device. This allows air to fill the tiny air sacs in the bases of your lungs. The deep breathing also helps to break up the mucus so you can \"cough it out.\" Circulation Lack of activity causes the blood to circulate more slowly and pool in the legs. This can lead to the formation of blood clots. To reduce this risk, your surgeon* will order intermittent compression sleeves or foot cuffs for you to wear. Blood thinners also may be prescribed. *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates.

You will need to keep the incision clean and dry. If Steri-Strips are present, keep them in place until seen by your physician.* If the ends come loose and curl up, they may be trimmed off. Leave the remaining Steri-Strip in place. Each day, change the dressing that covers your incision until your first post-op visit with your surgeon.* Follow the dressing change instructions provided. Here are a few suggestions to help promote healing and avoid infection: Keep your incision clean and dry. You may not shower until directed by your surgeon.* You may wash the area gently with soap and water, and pat dry after your first office visit. If you have staples, you may be asked to wait another couple of days after they are removed before showering. Do not apply lotion or ointments to your incision unless directed by your surgeon.*Notify your surgeon* if you notice any of the following: Separation of incision line at any point Increased temperature greater than 101 degrees, or chills Increased redness, swelling or warmth of the skin around the incision Increased pain at the incision site Red streaks on the skin near the incision site Tender bumps or nodules in your armpits or groin Foul smell from the incision Pus leaking from the incision *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates.

Therefore, it is very important to take good care of yourself with preventive care, screenings, tests and procedures. If you ever experience signs or symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills, pain, redness and/ or drainage from the incision area, call your surgeon.* An infection could start from a sore throat, urinary tract infection, deep cut or even an ear infection. Some tests, diagnostic procedures and illnesses can place you at a greater risk for developing an infection in your new joint even years after surgery. That's because bacteria can be introduced into your bloodstream in any number of ways. Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria can travel to your new joint and cause an infection because the artificial joint does not have your body's natural protection against infection. Three of the most common healthcare situations you might encounter that can cause an infection are dental care, urological care and colonoscopy. Dental care Dental care after surgery can introduce bacteria into your bloodstream through cuts and trauma to the gums and gum lines. In anticipation of this risk, most surgeons* recommend taking a one-time dose of antibiotics just prior to any dental work. Your surgeon* will have specific instructions and the length of time they need to be followed after joint surgery. Also, make sure your dentist and dental hygienist are aware of your new joint.Urological care Invasive procedures involving the urethra, bladder, ureters or kidneys are ways that bacteria can enter your system and contaminate your bloodstream. Needle biopsies of the prostate are included in this risk. Under normal circumstances, the body can usually fight off potential infection associated with these procedures. However, that's not necessarily true after joint replacement surgery. Make sure to inform any medical personnel about your artificial joint before they perform an invasive urological procedure. More important, talk to your orthopaedic surgeon* before undergoing any urological procedure. Your surgeon* will provide specific recommendations for you to follow. You also will be instructed how long to follow the recommendations after the procedure. Colonoscopy Routine colonoscopy screenings are an important part of preventive care. However, a colonoscopy can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream and eventually your artificial joint. Speak with your surgeon* and gastroenterologist* about the precautions that need to be taken. Make sure you follow your physicians'* recommendations to protect yourself and your new joint. *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates.

The blood clot can either partially or completely block the blood flow in the vein. DVT can result from leg inactivity brought on by: Surgery, especially on legs, hips, knees or abdominal area Badly broken leg bones or other trauma Immobility or being bedridden Cancer Myocardial infarction (heart attack) or congestive heart failure Severe infection Pregnancy Use of oral contraceptives Decreased circulation Prior DVTs Ankle pumps (see exercise on page 47) are important for increasing your blood circulation. These involve moving your ankles up and down and tightening your leg muscles. Your physical therapist will show you how to perform these exercises. DVT signs and symptoms Because DVT can produce life-threatening complications, it is important for you to know and be able to recognize DVT symptoms. If you notice any of these symptoms, you should call your primary care physician* immediately.Any or all of the following can be symptoms of DVT: Swelling in the calf or thigh area Pain in the calf area or behind the knee Increased pain with standing or walking Warmth/redness/tenderness in the affected area Low-grade fever DVT also can occur without any of the above symptoms. Pulmonary embolism The most common and serious complication of DVT is a pulmonary embolism (PE). A PE occurs when a blood clot breaks free from a vein wall and travels to the lung where it blocks an artery. A PE is life-threatening and needs immediate medical attention. Signs and symptoms of a PE include: Sudden onset of chest pain Sudden unexplained cough or coughing up blood Shortness of breath Lightheadedness, dizziness or cold sweats Feelings of restlessness, anxiety or rapid heartbeat Sense of impending doom *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates.

Your incision site and body need time to heal and adjust to the new joint. Your surgeon* will instruct you on when you can resume normal activities. Before leaving the hospital, you will practice walking, transferring from your bed and a chair, and dressing yourself. If your home has stairs, you also will practice climbing stairs. These basic tasks require you to use safety precautions to prevent injury to yourself and your new joint. Transfers in and out of bed (Illustration A): Back up to the bed until you feel the back of your knees touching it. Place your operated leg out in front of you. Reach for the bed with one arm and keep the other arm on the walker. Slowly lower yourself onto the bed. Scoot back onto the bed as much as possible. Lift one leg at a time onto the bed until both legs are supported. Continue to move legs to the center of the bed. Recline back. To get out of bed, reverse the steps. 37JOINT ADVENTURES > SAFETY PRECAUTIONS Transfers into and out of a chair Into a chair: Back up to the chair until you feel the back of your knees touching it. Place your operated leg out in front of you. If using crutches, move both crutches to one arm. Reach for the armrests and slowly lower yourself onto the chair. Continue to keep the operated leg straight. Scoot to the back of the chair.Out of a chair: Scoot forward to the edge of the chair so both feet are on the floor. Place your operated leg out in front of you and keep it there. Bend your knee and hip on the non-operated leg and try to keep most of your weight on this leg. Using your hands on the armrests, push yourself with your arms and non-operated leg to stand. Do not use a walker to pull yourself up; that may cause the walker to tip and could result in a fall. If using crutches, move crutches to one arm and push to stand with one arm on crutches and one arm on armrest. *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates.

You also can have the backrest reclined to maximize your space. Back up to the car using your walker until the backs of your knees touch the edge of the car. Place your operated leg out in front of you and keep it straight throughout the transfer. Place one hand on the walker and the other hand on the frame of the vehicle. Slowly lower yourself onto the edge of the seat. Scoot as far back as possible on the seat. Turn towards the dashboard (making sure not to bend torso/head forward) as you bring one leg into the car at a time. Reposition the seat to allow for proper seatbelt function and comfort. Have the driver close the door for you. To get out of the car, reverse the steps. Recommendations: Use a plastic trash bag on car seats for easier scooting and sliding. Do not drive until your surgeon* gives you permission.B CJoint Adventures Safety Precautions *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates.

This is fairly simple to do before your surgery. Most of the suggested modifications require no extra equipment or expense. The following are home precautions you should follow: Check hallways, stairs or traffic areas of your home for potential tripping hazards such as loose-carpeting throw rugs are addressed below. Remove any clutter on the stairs. Check the location of extension cords or phone cords to make sure they are not in a pathway. Remove furniture that may cause a fall such as a rocking chair, glider, coffee table or ottoman. The bathroom is the most accident-prone room in your home. Use non-slip strips on the bottom of the tub or shower. Remove all throw rugs around the house and in the bathroom.Install grab bars by the toilet, and in the shower or tub area. Soap dishes, towel bars or doorknobs are not acceptable substitutes for grab bars. Place frequently used kitchen items in easily accessible places, such as on the countertop or tables. Items should be at or just below waist level, or just at shoulder height. Do not use a \"reacher\" for overhead items. If possible, have your bed accessible from both sides. Do not use furniture that has casters. Place portable phones in rooms where you will spend most of your time and in your bedroom. Use nightlights in heavily traveled hallways and in bathrooms. Your home care therapist will make recommendations for any other items you might need in the bathroom during the first visit following your discharge.41JOINT ADVENTURES > SAFETY PRECAUTIONS Adaptive equipment Bathing spongeRaised toilet seat with arm and clamp Toilet safety frame Elastic laces3-in-1 commode Shower chairRaised toilet seat Spiro elastic lacesJoint Adventures Safety Precautions42JOINT ADVENTURES > SAFETY PRECAUTIONS Notes:43 Outpatient Physical Therapy44 Joint Adventures Outpatient Physical Therapy *In the spirit of keeping you well-informed, some of the physician(s) and/or individual(s) identified are neither agents nor employees of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare or any of its affiliates.

Your surgeon* can implant a new joint, but it is your job to do the required physical therapy exercises to ensure your joint returns to an optimum functioning level. We recommend you work with a physical therapist specially trained in orthopaedics and joint replacement. The physical therapist will instruct you on the correct exercises, as well as how and when to increase your exercise time and repetitions. In the hospital immediately after your surgery, your physical therapist will: Work with you to get you up and walking \u2014 in most cases, the same day of your surgery Work with you twice a day until you are discharged Instruct you on the correct exercises Explain how and when to increase your exercise time and repetitions After discharge, your therapy can continue at your home with another member of the orthopaedic care team \u2014 a Northwestern Medicine Home Health physical therapist.Northwestern Medicine outpatient physical therapy You will continue physical therapy at home until your therapist and surgeon* decide you can progress to outpatient physical therapy. At this point, you have an important decision to make on where to continue your physical therapy. You can continue with yet another member of our orthopaedic care team \u2014 a Northwestern Medicine outpatient physical therapist. Through Northwestern Medicinel, you can choose from 45 outpatient physical therapy locations in Greater DeKalb County and the western suburbs. Our licensed physical therapists will work together and communicate with your physician* during your rehabilitation process. They also will develop a program to meet your individual needs and goals. Your one-on-one therapy sessions can be with the same therapist during your entire outpatient treatment. This helps to ensure continuity and the ability to measure and accurately report your progress to your physician.* Plus your medical records are accessible 24/7 to both your physician* and therapist.Outpatient physical therapy45When deciding where you will go for outpatient therapy, consider the following: Is the therapist licensed or a trainer/instructor? Will you be working one-on-one with that therapist during your entire therapy session? Will you have therapy with the same individual throughout your rehabilitation? How will the therapist communicate your progress to your surgeon*? Will the therapist have access to your medical records? Ask the following questions about the facility: What type of accreditation does this outpatient facility have? How long has it been treating patients? What is the most common type of treatment performed at this facility? How much experience does it have with joint replacements? How many joint replacement patients has it treated? Does it have evening and weekend appointment times? Is this facility in your insurance network?Pain management during physical therapy It is important to have adequate pain management to reach your optimal functioning level, but still be able to exercise. If you haven't had any pain medication within 3 hours of your scheduled physical therapy session, we suggest you take some at least 30 minutes before you begin exercising. With time, you should be able to decrease the amount of pain medication required. If your pain level and need for pain medication don't decrease after several weeks, discuss the situation with your physical therapist.Joint Adventures Outpatient Physical Therapy46JOINT ADVENTURES > OUTPATIENT PHYSICAL THERAPY Exercise is very important following your knee replacement surgery. The exercises on the next few pages are recommended before and after surgery. Your physical therapist also may give you additional exercises not listed in this book. Do only those exercises approved by your physical therapist.Begin with 10 repetitions of each exercise at least 2 times a day. As you get stronger, you can increase the number of repetitions and duration. Remember: Exer cises should be done on a firm surface. Don't hold your breath while doing these exercises. Take your pain medication 30 minutes before your therapy session if you haven't had any in the past 3 hours. Pain management is important in order for you to maximize your therapy.
