Testimonials on Living a Beautiful Life ...a life without suffering... \"From my very first session I felt I had finally come across someone that was willing to understand and not judge. Shakti Therapy, not only made me feel safe, but also led me on to my self-love journey. With therapy I uncovered years of trauma and pain. I was guided to realize I have my truth which needs no one else's validation. Today, I am able to put myself out there due to all my sessions with Shakti Therapy. My therapist was warm, kind and welcoming. I truly believe if I had not approached Shakti Therapy, I wouldn't be the person I am today.\" \"In my culture, therapy was introduced to me as a \"waste\" of time & money. When I first reached out to Shakti Therapy I was looking for a \"quick solution\". I was in a tight spot, embarrassed to be looking into therapy, deeply depressed & unable to function. My journey with my therapist cracked open parts of me that I buried behind a tough immigrant-minded exterior of \"pushing on\". My therapist quite literally introduced to me the kind of self-love that requires unraveling generational & personal trauma instead of shoving it into a forgotten corner. Today I don't suffer with depression and I am happy!\" \"As a young Black woman, in my community, therapy is seen as a taboo. We're usually told to take your issues to God or just pray about it. With Shakti Therapy, I was able to combine my faith & learn tools to control my anxiety. My therapist helped me to understand that it's okay for me to have anxiety & I can control it and I have ultimate power over my life. My therapist definitely changed my life in understanding that other people's opinions or their actions towards me is not a reflection of me.
