Autism and Family Therapy Raising a healthy child is always a challenging responsibility. This is especially true when caring for a child with Autism or a related disability. The time and energy required for a child's treatment can seriously strain a family's resources. Many parents have found that family therapy can help them cope with the distress that comes with all of the many issues related to caring for a child with Autism, and may help them to discover resources that will benefit their child. Family Therapy can help you develop resources and resiliencies that will help you and your child through difficult times. The benefits of Family Therapy may include: Trained counselors who have worked with other families who have children with Autism Spectrum Disorders Information on the most current and effective resources available An outlet for expressing your thoughts and feelings (yes parents, frustration, anger and sadness are normal in these situations) Autism Behavioral Health Benefit Overview Effective Behavioral Analysis MHNet Behavioral Health offers access to Applied Behavioral Analysis for members diagnosed with Autism or other pervasive developmental disorders. Applied Behavioral Analysis can help children with Autism achieve a higher level of functioning and improve social skills. Behavioral treatment for Autism is most effective when it is started as early as possible. Applied Behavioral Analysis [ABA] treatment is intensive, often requiring as much as 25 hours per week of active treatment time. Applied Behavioral Analysis does not cure Autism; instead, it helps to minimize the symptoms, and maximize independence and quality of life. Parents are often involved in learning how to apply ABA in order to continue their child's growth. Successful results are achieved through behavioral observations and positive reinforcements that help children learn each small step of a task. Research has shown that these children cannot learn from \"normal\" cues in their environment, but they can learn from more specific instructions provided in concert with their needs and interests. Finding the Right Treatment Sorting through the available treatments can be a difficult task. The medical community is making great strides in developing new ways to treat Autism. However, not all treatments have been proven to be effective. In concert with your child's physician or psychologist, MHNet's trained clinicians can help you sort through the available treatments and ensure your child receives the most appropriate care. \u00a9 2011 MHNet For more information or to talk with a Counse lor, please call MHNet: 1.877.398.5816 Online Services: www.mhnet.com Callers with TTY equipment, please call: 1.800.338.2039 An opportunity to have all family members communicate and problem- solve in a structured, safe environment Access to advocacy and support groups Frequently Asked Questions When does the ICUBA Autism benefit go into effect?
