The sale and consumption of burgers served less than thoroughly cooked (LTTC) and pink in the middle is a steadily increasing trend and a number of catering chains and outlets now offer this option to customers . This prompted concerns that there may be an increased risk of exposur e to E. coli O157 for consumers who prefer this type of food. The Food Standards Agency's Board concluded that burgers served LTTC should be delivered to the same level of protection as thorough coo king provides the consumer (a 6 log reduction in microbial load). However, reduced cooking procedures at the catering establishment outlets are unlikely to achieve 6 log reduction in burgers LTTC . Therefore, t he safe production of this product at catering establishments is likely to be significantly reliant on c ontrols and/or interventions applied at the beef processing facilities previously in the chain, particularly slaughterhouses and cutting plants . Implementation of appropriate additional interventions is required through primary production and beef processi ng to maintain the ov erall level o f protection the 6 log reduction provides. This would allow LTTC burgers to be served with the same level of protection as fully cooked burger s. Microbial contamination of beef carcasses occurs regularly in commercial abat toir conditions through direct or indirect routes from a number of sources. Consequently, hazard -based intervention/decontamination measures have been considered, and widely used in beef abattoirs in some countries, as a means to prevent or reduce microbial contamination of beef carcasses and to reduce microbiological hazards further than what is achievable solely by adhering to the Good Hygiene Practices (GHP). Currently, only po table water (i.e. thermal treatment with hot water and steam pasteurisation) and lactic acid beef carcass washing have be en permitted for use in the EU. The integrated and coordinated use of multiple interventions in the minced beef production chain may be able to reduce microbial loads sufficiently to offer the same level of prote ction to consumers from burgers, which are produced with these interventions and are served LTTC, as that of thoroughly cooked burgers originating from convention al minced beef production chain. The main aim of the proposed study is to perform a broad crit ical review of available literature on the scientific research in intervention measures for beef, to obtain quantitative information on the reduction of bacterial load in minced b eef production chain. The review cover s a range of GHP -based and hazard -based interventions at the abattoir stage (from receive and unload of animals to chilled carcasses) and post -abattoir stage (further processing of raw beef and packaging) , looking at the outcome of interventions on a range of bacterial indicators and foodborne pathogens. Page 8 of 164 Objectives There were two objectives of this study: To perform a broad critical review of the literature of a contribution of interventions applied in a minced beef production chain fo r the reduction of bacteria l load, with a focus on the pre -slaughter, slaughter, and post- slaughter production processes To make recommendations on the effectiveness (the quantifiable level of bacterial reduction) of specific interventions for beef and other contextual factors that will inform the risk management decisions for further work Approach The review considered evidence on beef intervention efficacy available in the public domain, including primary research, previous ly published systematic reviews, risk assessments and stochastic models. Only primary rese arch studies were used for detailed data extraction and reporting. The population of interest included all cattle produced for domestic UK meat consumption, including their carcasses at processing and finished products (beef trim and ground/minced beef). A lso, population of interest included potential sources of beef contamination during processing (i.e. cattle hides, environment surfaces and tools/knives/ equipment). Relevant outcome measures for interventions were the effectiveness of each intervention i n reducing log levels of indicator bacteria (aerobic colony counts (ACC), Enterobacteriaceae counts (EBC), total coliform counts and generic E. coli counts ) and log levels of foodborne pathogens (primarily E. coli O157 and other VTEC and Salmonella , but also other foodborne pathogens ). Where quantitative data on pathogen reduction were not available for specific intervention, data on prevalence outcomes were used. Any interventions applied from cattle receive d in abattoir up to and inclusive of finished product packaging and storage (minced beef production chain) were considered relevant. The interventions can be described as GHP -based and hazard -based control measures. Pre-slaughter beef interventions Several interventions were identified at the lairage stage, from cattle receive d to the stunning and bleeding steps . Good hygiene practi ces such as lairage cleaning, proper cattle handling to prevent hide cross -contamination and hide cleanliness assessment, are recommended for use. It has been shown that catego risation of cattle based on their cleanliness can statistically significantly re duce the microbial contamination of resulting beef carcasses including with faecal microbiota, but no such evidence exist s in relation to bacterial pathogens. Only one pote ntial hazard -based intervention that was identified, bacteriophage application to ca ttle hides at least one hour before slaughter , have been shown to have promising results in reducing levels of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp., Page 9 of 164 but is not commercially used at present. Other hide treatments of live cattle , such as chemical decontamination or hide clipping, are not recommended due to animal welfare concerns and /or practical considerations. Beef interventions at slaughter Cattle hide interventions , such as ch emical hide washes and microbial immobilisation treatment with shellac , are recommended for consideration as potential hazard -based interventions when applied post -exsanguination and before dehiding for reducing microbial contamination of resulting beef ca rcasses. It has been shown that these hide treatments, can deliver statistically significant reduction in microbial transfer effect to carcasses of 1-1.5 logs. Beef carcass hazard -based interventions are recommended for consideration for control of microbial contamination after dehiding and pre -chill. Carcass pasteurisation treatments with hot water and/or steam are efficacious against microorganisms when temperatures of carcass surfaces achieve more than 70oC, with reductions of 1 -2.5 logs . The time - temper ature combinations required to achieve statistically significant reductions are usually specific to an individual commercial abattoir and subject to validation. Chemical washes, particularly with lactic acid and other organic acids (acetic and citric) hav e also been efficacious , delivering 1 -1.5 logs reductions . Some other treatments, such as knife trimming and steam vacuuming are also highly efficacious when properly applied , delivering statistically significant reduction effect. However , reduction effects highly depend on the skill and diligence of the user to spot visible contamination and efficiently remove it, therefore interventions ' parameters are difficul t to optimise to achieve consistent effect in reducing microbial hazards. Standard processing pr ocedures , such as improved hide removal and bunging/rodding , have not been well researched but can have statistically significant effect in preventing carcass c ontamination, so are recommended for use as GHP - based measures. Multi ple use of carcass interventions (knife trimming, steam vacuuming, pasteurisation treatments and organic acid washes) was shown to have the biggest impact on microbial reduction on beef c arcasses , up to 3 logs , more than any of these interventions applied alone . Carcass c hilling had a limited and inconsistent effect in reducing microbial contamination but was found to be efficacious in inhibiting further bacterial growth. Water spray chilling showed very variable effects and was largely ineffective in reducing natural microbiota on carcasses in commercial conditions . There was insufficient evidence of the efficacy of spray chilling with various chemicals , but lactic acid washes during chilling delivered up to 1.5 logs reduction. Page 10 of 164 Post -slaughter beef interventions Good hygiene practic es during carcass fabrication are necessary to preve nt and minimise carcass cross -contamination post -chill. Various interventio ns for beef primals, subprimals and trim with physical (hot water) or chemical substances have shown good reduction effects on mi crobiota , often statistically significant . However, these treatments can only be used if properly optimised so to retain accept able sensory quality of the final products . Packaging -based interventions for beef cuts and minced beef had very variable effects in reduction of microbiota. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and vacuum packaging are considered useful to extend the shelf life of beef trim and minced beef, but they had very limited and not statistically significant reduction effect on E. coli O157: H7. However, the reduction effect can be increased up to 2 logs by adding lactic acid to the packaging which would make this intervention worth considering as a hazard- based . Irradiation can be considered a very efficacious , hazard -based intervention for final products and delivers complete elimination of potentially present bacterial pathogens. Other emer ging non -thermal technologies (such as high -pressure processing, cold atmospheric plasma and UV light irradiation) have not been well researched but under laboratory conditions have shown promising reduction effects on microorganisms. However, the commercial uptake of all these hazard -based interventions for final beef products will highly depend on consumer acceptance. Recommendations and future work This review identified a number of options for delivering the required level of protection to consumers o f LTTC burgers . They are summarised below. Cattle hide interventions, such as chemical hide washes and microbial immobilisation treatment with shellac , have been identified as efficacious and able to deliver 1 -1.5 logs reduction in transfer of bacteria to carcasses. They can be recommended for consideration as hazard -based interventions when applied post - exsanguination and before dehiding for reducing micro bial contamination of resulting beef carcasses . Beef carcass interventions, such as pasteurisation tr eatments with hot water and/or steam , have been identified as efficacious and able to deliver 1 -2.5 logs reduction. Also, organic (lactic) acid washes can deliver 1 -1.5 logs reduction. When both interventions are in in sequential use, they can deliver up to a 3 logs reduction . Both carcass pasteurisation treatments and organic (lactic) acid washes can be recommended for consideration as hazard -based interventions when applied after dehiding and pre -chill. Page 11 of 164 Organic (lactic) acid washes have also been identified as efficacious when applied on beef carcasses during chilling and at post -chill, pre -fabrication stage, and able to deliver around 1.5 logs reduction. They can be recommended for consideration as hazard -based interven tions when applied on carcasses at these stages. Interventions for beef cuts and minced beef at the post- slaughter stage, such as organic acid washes, MAP and vacuum packaging of meat (with added lactic acid), have been identified as efficacious and able t o deliver up to 2 logs reduction. They can be recommended for consideration as hazard -based interventions when applied at the final product, but only if properly optimised to retain the qual ity of the product. There are certain interventions for which the re is a lack of evidence (e.g. hide removal practices, bunging/rodding); that have shown inconsistent results in reducing microbial contamination (particularly in respect to pathogens, e.g. hide cleanliness assessment, hide clipping, chilling); or where no processing parameters in reducing carcass contamination can be clearly established (e.g. environment, equipment and tools sanitation, knife trimming and steam vacuuming ). These interventions can be recommended for use as GHP -based control measures , alongs ide hazard- based interventions, to assist in overall microbial reduction . The s equential use of beef carcass interventions as a part of 'multiple -hurdle approach' (knife trimming, steam vacu uming, pasteurisat ion treatments and organic acid washes) delivere d higher reductions than any of the interventions applied alone , from 2 to 3 logs. The sequential use of GHP - and hazard -based carcass interventions can be recommended for consideration, par ticularly when they are used alongside other recommended interventions at pre -slaughter, slaughter and post -slaughter. In order to address differences in study designs and results on the intervention efficacies between multiple studies identified in this review, further meta -analysis of data generated in this study is needed. This, coupled with subsequent use of data in quantitative risk modelling can enhance the confidence of the contribution of beef interventions in the reduction of m icrobial load to mee t required performance criteria, and would provide a more evidence -based model for public health analyses . The review identified certain interventions where there was a relative lack of data and further research is needed. These are: i) the interventions i n the pre -slaughter stage, particularly cattle handling in the lairage and hazard -based bacteriophage treatment for cattle hides ; ii) cattle hide interventions post -exsanguination and carcass interventions during chilling and at post chill, pre -fabrication stage ; iii) n ovel emerging technologies for beef cuts and minced beef, such as electron beam and gamma irradiation, high -pressure processing and bacteriophage treatments ; and iv) Page 12 of 164 generally controlled trials conducted under commercial c onditions, particularly investigating multiple interventions applied at slaughter, prior to dehiding to pre - fabrication stage. Page 13 of 164 1 Background and rationale The most relevant bovine meat -borne biological hazards categorised as of high -priority for control in the beef chain by t he European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are Salmonella and verocytotoxin -producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) (EFSA, 2013). This decision was made through a risk ranking process which was based on the assessment of: (i) the magnitude of the human health impa ct based on reported incidence, (ii) the severity of the disease in humans based on fatalities among reported cases, and (iii) the strength of evidence that meat from b ovine animals is an important risk factor for the disease in humans , including carcass/animal prevalence (EFSA, 2013) . Salmonella and VTEC can be harboured in and excreted from the gastrointestinal tract of cattle. They are subsequently transferred from ca ttle to humans (leading to beef- borne illness) , most often through faec al contamination or cross -contamination of meat , and/or their growth during production, handling and consumption of beef and products thereof (Buncic et al. 2014) . The control of these pathogens in the beef chain requires use of Go od Manufacturing Practice/Good Hygien ic Practice (GMP/GHP) and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles. In many cases under commercial conditions, this is not sufficient to control microbial contamination and therefore must be accompa nied by implementation of appropriate additional intervention measures, taking into account considerations regarding resources and technical possibilities, consumers' attitude and behaviours, and cost -benefit (Bunci c et al. 2014) . Microbial contamination of beef carcasses occurs regularly in commercial abattoir conditions through direct or indirect routes from a number of sources. T he main sources are: i) faecal material and rumen/gut contents; ii) hide of slaughte red cattle; and iii) slaughterline environment (machinery, equipment, workers and aerosols). However, while in modern abattoirs leakage/spillage of gut contents onto the meat occurs rarely (with some estimations of 1 in 1,000 carcasses), and the slaughterl ine environment as a contamination source is efficiently controlled through the pre-requisite programmes (GMP/GHP) , the contamination of carcasses from the cattle hides is a key and inevitable event (Antic et al. 2011, Blagojevic et al. 2012) . Most often, bacterial counts obtained from carcasses after dehiding are correlated with those on hides (Blagojevic et al. 2011) and are s trongly dependent on cattle hide cleanliness (Blagojevic et al. 2012) . It was found that cattle hides can carry up to 11 log CFU/cm2 of aerobic bacteria (Antic et al. 2010), including pathogens such as E. coli O157 and other VTEC and Salmonella , which consequentl y can contam inate carcass meat (Reid et al . 2002). The proportion of microbiota transferred from hides onto beef carcasses via all routes, commercially, was found to be between 1.6% and 0.003% (Bacon et al. 2000, Ar thur et al. 2004) . Mor e recently, it was shown that microbial counts on beef after direct contact with cattle hides can reach up to 7.7 log CFU/cm2 of aerobic bacteria and 4.0 log CFU/cm2 of Page 14 of 164 Enterobacteriaceae , with up to 10% of artificially inoculated E. coli O157 on cattle hi des being transferred to beef (Antic et al. 2018) . Results obtained in Scotland revealed that 55% of cattle had E. coli O157 contaminated hide s after bleeding (Mather et al. 2007) . A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model developed for E. coli O157:H7 in beef burger s produced in the Republic of Ireland indicated that the initial prevalence and numbers of E. coli O157:H7 on the bovine hide had the greatest impact on the overall probability of illness from this p athogen, and that the cross -contamination at the hide rem oval stage impacted on predicted risk (Duffy et al. 2006). Another related quantitative simulation model indicated that risk reduction measures should be directed towards reducing the hide to carcass transfer during dehiding and the initial E. coli O157:H 7 prevalence and counts on bovine hides (Cummins et al. 2008). These conclusions highlight the necessity for the development and implementation of effective intervention strategies to control foodborne pathogens (particularly E. coli O157) at slaughter. Th is is of particular relevance because of the recent and growing preference by some consumers for less than thoroughly cooked (LTTC) burgers in the UK, which increases the risk of exposure to E. coli O157 for those individuals (FSA, 2015). Interventions are used in most countries with the aim to reduce microbiological risks further than what is achievable solely by adhering to GHP. Some aspects of these contro l strategies are pathogen - and meat chain stage -specific. Thus, some pathogens in beef and the produ cts thereof (e.g. VTEC, Salmonella ) are most efficiently controlled by the main measures applied during primary production (on -farm) combined with optimizat ion of the slaughter hygiene (at -abattoir), whilst some others (e.g. Listeria monocytogenes ) are mos t efficiently controlled at the processing -storage stages (Buncic et al. 2014). Interventions can be GHP -based measures applied throughout slaughter and dr essing process (i.e. cleaning and disinfection of lairage -to-stunning areas, hide cleanliness assessment, bunging, oesophagus tying, hide removal methods, trimming, chilling, equipment sanitation, etc) and hazard- based intervention measures (i.e. a range o f different interventions for cattle hides and carcass meat mostly aimed at microbial removal, immob ilisation and/or killing). I nterventions are also applied at post -fabrication (processing- storage) stages aimed at microbial killing or inhibiting their growth. In some countries, e.g. USA, decontamination treatments of hides and carcasses are regularly us ed and integrated within a intervention -based HACCP system (Byelashov & Sofos, 2009; Koohmaraie 2007; Wheeler et al . 2014); such interventions have not yet been used under commercial conditions within the EU (including the UK). There is, howev er, provision for the use of decontamination strategies in abattoirs in the EU. The EU Food Hygiene Regulations (EC, 853/2004) allow, in principle, the use of decontamination treatments during slaughter, following appropriate consideration and approval of such treatments by the regulatory authorities (EC, 2004). Page 15 of 164 Currently, only potable water (i.e. thermal treatment with hot water and steam pasteurisation) and lactic acid beef carcass washing (Regulation EC 101/2013) have been permitted for use in European a battoirs. However, no intervention strat egy can be expected to sufficiently reduce the microbiological load of a highly contaminated carcass . The ultimate effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments, when assessed through the levels of surviving microbiota remaining on a treated substrate, depends primarily on the initial microbial load (Sofos & Smith, 1998). Therefo re, interventions must not be a substitute for GHP, b ut only an additional measure. Implementation of successful interventions against relevant microbial hazards in the meat chain up to and including the chilled carcass stage is now recognised as an essential component of a risk -based meat safety assurance system in which high- risk animal batches should be subjected to additional slaughter hygiene control measures complemented with (hide and meat) decontamination treatments (Blagojevic and Antic, 2014; EFS A, 2013). These recent efforts in the modernisation of meat inspection and its transformation into a risk-based meat safety assurance system inte grate both meat inspection procedures and FBO's food safety management systems (FSMS) and other relevant aspect s into a coherent whole (Buncic et al . 2014). Interventions can routinely be used either alone or applied at multiple points as a 'multiple hurdle strategy' in a coordinated way, in order to ultimately achieve an acceptable reduction in the residual microbiological safety risk associated with beef (Buncic et al . 2014). For example, cattle hide interventions can be used as a part of a multiple -hurdle strategy in combination with the beef carcass interven tions (spot or whole dressed carcass decontamination) and with the resulting beef trimmings decontamination to reduce load further 2007; Antic et al . 2018). Where multip le interventions are applied, it is reasonable to expect that the overall improvement of the microbiological status of beef would be determined by a combination of microbial reductions achieved by all interventions, and be greater than the individual effec t of each intervention in isolation. Therefore, the integ rated and coordinated use of multiple interventions in the minced beef production chain may be able to reduce microbial loads sufficiently to offer the same level of protection to consumers from burg ers, which are produced with these interventions and are served LTTC as that of thoroughly cooked burgers originating from conventional minced beef production chain. The recent growing preference by some consumers in the UK for LTTC burgers prompted concer ns that there may be an increased risk of exposure to E. coli O157 for those consumers (FSA, 2015). The sale and consumption of burgers served LTTC and pink in the middle is a steadily increasing trend and a number of catering chains and outlets now offer this option to customers . The saf e production of LTTC burgers at catering establishments is likely to be significantly reliant on controls and/or interventions applied at the beef processing facilities previously in the chain, particularly slaughterhouses and cutting plants . Page 16 of 164 The Food Stan dards Agency Board concluded that burgers served LTTC should be delivered to the same level of protection as thorough coo king provides the consumer (a 6 log reduction in microbial load). However, given the reduced cooking procedures, it is highly unlikely that 6 log reduction will have been achieved solely at the catering establishment level . Therefore , implementation of appropriate additional interventions is required through primary prod uction and beef processing to maint ain the overall level of protection achieved by the 6 log reduction thorough cooking provides. This ensures LTTC burgers , produced with these additional interventions in primary production and beef processing, to be served with t he same level of protection as fully cooked burger s produced without such interventions (FSA, 2015) . The FSA 's position is that the Food Business Operators (FBOs ) serving LTTC burgers should ensure that their suppliers have procedures in place during slaughter, cutting and mincing , which are as hygienic as possible , with the specific intention of preventing meat surface contamination with pathogens . Furthermore , FBOs must have documented and validated evidence of procedures throughout the supply chain, that can achieve at least a 4 log reduction before the burger is served to the final consumer , and also an advice to consumers at the point of ordering a burger (FSA, 2015, 2016) . Page 17 of 164 2 Scope and objectives of the study The main aim of this study was to perform a broad critical review of available scientific literature on intervention measures for beef, and to obtain quantitative information on the reduction of bacterial load in the minced beef production chain achieved via interventions applied at pre -slaughter, slaughter and post- slaughte r. More specific objectives of this study were twofold: To perform a broad critical review of the literature of a contribution of interventions applied in a minced be ef production chain fo r the reduction of bacteria l load, with a focus on the pre -slaughter , slaughter, and post- slaughter production processes To make recommendations on the effectiveness (the quantifiable level of bacterial reduction) of specific interventions for beef and other contextual factors that will inform the risk management decisions for further work The review considered evidence on beef intervention efficacy available in the public domain, including primary research, previou sly published systematic reviews, risk assessments and stochastic models. However, o nly primary research studi es were used for detailed data extraction and reporting. The population of interest included all cattle produced for domestic UK meat consumption, including their carcasses at processing and finished products (beef trim and ground/minced beef). Also, popul ation of interest included potential sources of beef contamination during processing (i.e. cattle hides, environment surfaces and tools/knives/ equipment). Meat from cattle is primarily destined for cons umption as minced beef or beef cuts. Beef cuts are w hole muscle cuts commonly consumed as steaks or roasts and are derived from subprimal cuts subdivided from primal cuts fabricated ( initially separated from the carcass) during cutting and deboning of cattle carcasses. Minced beef is derived from b oned beef that has been minced into fragments and contains less than 1% salt. In the case of b eef minced meat produce d from chilled meat, the requirements specifi ed in the hygiene regulations are that it must be prepared: i) within no more than six days of animal s laughter or ii) within no more than 15 days from the date of slaughter of the animals in the case of boned, vacuum -packed beef and veal (EC, 2004). Relevant outcome measures for interventions were the effectiveness of each intervention in reducing log leve ls of indicator bacteria (aerobic colony counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts, total col iform counts and generic E. coli counts ) and log levels of foodborne pathogens (primarily E. coli O157 and other non-O157 VTEC serogroups and Salmonella, but also other foodborne perfringens , where data were available). Where quantitative data on pathogen reduction were not available for specific intervention, data on prevalence outcomes were used. Page 18 of 164 Any interventions applie d from cattle receive d in abattoir up to and inclusive of finished product packaging and storage (minced beef production chain) were considered relevant. The interventions can be desc ribed as GHP -based and hazard -based control measures. GHP -based measures are pre -requisites to hazard -based measures and are qualitative in nature and based on empirical knowledge and experience. Some examples of GHP -based control measures applied througho ut slaughter and dressing process are: cleaning and disinfection of lairage -to-stunning areas, hide cleanliness assessment, bunging, rodding, hide removal methods, trimming, chilling, and sanitation of tools /equipment. On the other hand, hazard- based inte rvention measures are developed from scientific research to specifically control certain hazards and are able to provide demonstrable and quantifiable reduction in bacterial load . Some examples of h azard -based intervention measures are: i) at abattoir lev el: Interventions for cattle hides pre- or post -exsanguination - ambient water washes , hide clipping, hide chemical washes and microbial immobilisation treatme nt of cattle hides with shellac ; Interventions for beef carcasses after dehiding but pre -chill - thermal washes such as hot water washes, steam vacuuming and steam pasteurisation; organic acid washes and washes with other c hemical solutions and oxidizers; Interventions for beef carcass es during chilling - spray c hilling with water or chemicals; Inter ventions for beef carcass es post -chill - carcass washes with chemicals ; ii) at post -abattoir level for fabricated beef ( primals and subprimals , trimmings and minced meat): Thermal washes (hot water) and chemical washes (organic acids and other chemicals), electron beam and gamma irradiation, ultraviolet (UV) light, use of bacteriophages, c old atmospheric plasma and high -pressure processing, modified packaging and preservation techniques ( including active and bioactive packaging systems). The concentration and prevalence outcomes (intervention efficacy results) a re presented as log reductions and prevalence reductions in the intervention compared with the control group. T hey are analysed as : i) reduction on a treated substrate (i.e. surfaces, hide, carcass meat, fabricated beef); and ii) reduction in transfer to a substrate (usually carcass meat) from the contamination source. The review also distinguish ed between study trials Page 19 of 164 conducted unde r laboratory and pilot plant conditions (often using artificially ino culated microbiota1), as well as those investigated under commercial conditions. More details regarding methodology used in this study can be found in Annex 1. 1 Artificially inoculated microorganisms are often used in challen ge trials where subjects are artificially challenged or exposed to the disease agent and then allocated to the intervention groups for evaluation of the outcome. It is a study method of choic e when the presence and levels of microorganisms of interest in g iven population are naturally low. Page 20 of 164 3 Beef chain intervention assessment 3.1 Lairage interventions Four observational studies investigat ing lairage cleaning and disinfection found consistent presence of f oodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella , E. coli O157 and Campylobacter on lairage surfaces, even after routine cleansing operations, sometimes containing up to 104 organisms per sampled area (2,500 cm2). Up to a 5 log -cycles of microbial reduction can be achieved on lairage surfaces using pressure water wash with quaternary ammonium sanitisers and/or steam under pressure. No evidence for specific interventions against foodborne pathogens applied at the lairage stage in cattle was identified in this review . Seven observational and molecular studies , as well as one study using marker organisms , suggest ed the potential for lairage to be an area of amplification and transmission of VTEC and Salmonella among cattle . Although reduced lairage time can be beneficial to re ducing cattle contamination with V TEC and Salmo nella , it is not always practical to minimis e the duration in lairage for cattle in commercial settings . There was a d irect correlation between visual hide cleanliness and microbial contamination of resulting beef carcasses with microbiological indicators of general ( Aerobic Colony Counts (ACC)) and faecal contamination ( Enterobacteriaceae (EBC) and generic E. coli ). A steady decrease i n carcass microbial load by 0.5 -3 log -cycles of ACC, 0.7 -1.5 logs of EBC and 0.4 -0.8 logs of generic E. coli was found with the increase in hide cleanliness (as measured according to the hide cleanliness scoring systems) in four reviewed studies . Therefore , this GHP measure could be efficacious in reducing bacterial transfer from dirty hides to resulting carcasse s by about 1 log -cycles . Hide water wash of live cattle in lairage with ambient temperature water was ineffective in reducing microbial load in thr ee reviewed studies . Washing with cetylpyridinium c hloride (CPC) yielded promising reductions in hide -to-carcass transfer of 1.5 and 1.1 logs of ACC and EBC, respectively , and reduced prevalence of naturally present E. coli O157 (from 23% in control to 3% in carcasses whose hides had been washed). Hide clipping was found to be largely ineffective , with very moderate reductions in transfer of ACC to carcass of up to 0.3 logs in one reviewed study . Bacteriophage spray application s with 1 h contact time are suitable for use on live cattle and were reported to achieve up to 2 log reduction of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 on cattle hide sections in lab conditions (bacteriophages e11/2 and e4/1c ). However, only one study conducted under commercial condition s found no reductions in E . coli O157:H7 prevalence (a proprietary bacteriophage formulation Finalyse\u00ae ). Apart from the phage treatment, for which a certain contact time with the hide is required for the full intervention effect, other interventions (washing and c lipping) are more appropriate for use post -exsanguination where harsher treatments can also be applied . Page 21 of 164 3.2 Cattle hide interventions The review found a relative lack of published information on cattle hide interventions (33 studies reviewed on different inter ventions ). Cattle hide is a major source of resulting beef carcass microbial contamination, and therefore there were some attempts to control microbial contamination on the hides with the aim to remove, kill or immobilise bacteria, and ultimately p revent their transfe r to derived carcasses during dehiding. Most studies investigated intervention efficacy on hides only, without measuring actual efficacy in reducing microbial transfer to the meat. Therefore , the efficacies achieved on hides can be referred to as 'relativ e efficacies' and only as an indication of the potential reduction in transfer of bacteria to resulting beef carcasses. Consequently , the on ly relevant measurement of cattle hide intervention efficacy is microbial status of resulting beef carca sses immediately after dehiding. Hence, even when some of these interventions showed promising efficacy in reducing microbiota on hides, it is largely e xpected that the effect in reducing carcass meat surface contamination would be much smaller. There wer e only six controlled trials conducted under commercial conditions post - exsanguination that reported hide intervention effects on resulting beef carcass surfaces : one study on hide wash with sodium hydroxide, one investigating chemical dehairing, two studi es on microbial immobilisation treatments with ethanol and aqueous shellac solutions, and two on hide clipping . Hide washing post -exsanguination with a mbient or warm water under pilot and commercial conditions was found to reduce indicator bacteria by up to 1 log -cycles on hides and also decrease the prevalence of V TEC and Salmonella in eight reviewed studies . Increased efficacy of water washing was achieved when additional vacuuming or manual curry comb were used, often by 1 log -cycle. On the other hand, four studies that investigated hide clipping found very moderate reductions in transfer of ACC to beef carca sses of up to 0.3 logs of indicator bacteria. It was noted in several studies that hide clipping could be useful as a GHP pre -treatment to subseque nt hazard -based hide interventions. One study under commercial conditions found that localised application of lactic and acetic acids yielded reductions on cattle hides of 2.3 -2.6 and 3.7 logs , respectively, of general and faecal microbiota. Under pilot pl ant conditions, oxidisers reduced general and faecal microbiota by 2.0 -3.5 and 2.0-4.0 log cycles on treated cattle hides. Under commercial conditions, automated hide wash es with sodium hydroxide achieved statistically significant reduction of 0.8 logs in the transfer to carcasses of aerobic and enteric bacteria and 17% to 2% in the prevalence of E. coli O157. Vacuuming following hide washing with chemicals appears to further decrease bacterial levels on hides by 1 -2 log -cycles. Page 22 of 164 Harsher treatments such as c hemical dehairing and thermal interventions were reported to be highly efficacious, but with questionable practical use because of hide damage and difficulties of waste disposal. Chemical dehairing was the most successful treatment under commercial conditi ons achieving reduction in the transfer to carcasses of aerobic and enteric bacteria of 2 log s and 1.8 logs and the prevalence of E. coli O157 from 50% to 1%. Hot water washes of hides and steam treatments achieved reductions on treated hides of up to 6 lo g-cycles. Three studies investigated a novel approach to immobilise rather than eliminate bacteria on hides , using natural resin shellac sprayed onto cattle hides. R eductions in transfer to meat of general microbiota of up to 3.6 logs under lab and 1.7 log s under commercial conditions were reported when shellac in ethanol was used. Comparable resu lts were also observed when using aqueous shellac solutions , with reductions in transfer to meat of up to 3 logs and 2.4 logs of aerobic and enteric bacteria, resp ectively, under lab conditions and to resulting beef carcasses of up to 1.1 logs and 0.7 logs of ACC and EBC , respectively, under commercial conditions. 3.3 Beef carcass interventions 3.3.1 Standard processing procedures and GHP There was a lack of published studies describing the efficacy of standard processing procedures and good hygiene practices (hide removal methods, bung bagging and overall process hygiene ) in reducing beef carcass microbial contamination (13 studies reviewed in total) . An assessment of hide r emoval practices in four studies indicated statistically significant reduction in transfer of indicator bacteria from hides to carcasses by 1 log -cycle and reduced prevalence of V TEC and Salmonella on beef carcasses when practices were improved (mea sured b y subjective assessment) . In relation to this, one study in commercial conditions didn't find any benefit of implementing downward vs. upward hide pulling method, but some differences were noted on specific carcass sites, often in favour of upward t echniqu e. Bung bagging appear s to be efficacious in the three studies where reductions of indicator bacteria by around 1 log -cycle and of the prevalence of V TEC were reported. Alternative methods for knives sanitation were in most cases shown to be equiva lent to the current sanitation procedures in water at 82\u00b0C for one second, in 11 reviewed studies . These include m ethods suitable for use on the slaughterline with contact times up to 1 minute , such as dipping knives in water for longer times at lower temp erature s (60-70oC), use of ultrasound combined with organic acids, and use of chemicals (sanitisers, peroxyacetic and organic acids). Page 23 of 164 3.3.2 Pre-chill carcass treatments A relatively large number of studies have been published on beef carcass interventions post dehidi ng but pre -chill (the review identified 90 such studies) . Most of these were conducted under laboratory conditions using inoculated microbiota. Studies reported on water wa shes, thermal treatments (hot water wash, spot steam vacuuming and whole carcass ste am pasteurisation), chemical washes with organic acids and other chemicals. There were large variations in the magnitude of reduction effect seen in studies investigating t he same intervention, due to different intervention conditions used, and therefore t he results on intervention efficacy are not directly comparable. Water wash with ambient or cold water to remove microorganisms was largely ineffective with up to 0.5 log reduction achieved, but also dependant on washing time and pressure used. Very often, washing carcasses appeared to have increased contamination and/or redistribute d bacteria. Trimming of visually contaminated sites reduced levels of n atural microbiota by 1-2 logs. Steam- vacuum uses steam to loosen contamination and kill bacteria, follow ed by the application of a vacuum to remove contaminants , and it was shown to have similar effect s to trimming . Steam vacuum cleaning of visible carcass contamination is of ten used before evisceration and is considered as effective as carcass trimming in removal of bacterial contamination, with the additional effect of killing bacteria with heat. However, the effectiveness of steam vacuum often depends on the skill and dilig ence of the user and is reliant on spotting visible contamination so there is no guarantee that all contamination will be removed. Hot water washing provided consistent reduction effects (i.e. seen across a number of studies) of 1-2.5 logs, with an additio nal reduction of 0.5-1 log -cycles if organic acids were used concurrently . Hot water wash was usually efficacious against microorganisms when temperatures of carcass surfaces achieve more than 70 oC. The time -temperature combinations required to achieve sta tistically significant reductions are usually specific to an individual commercial a battoir and subject to validation. The whole carcass steam pasteurisation effect in reducing natural microbiota was most often around 1 -1.5 log -cycles. Generally, the process of steam pasteurisation should allow the carcass surface temperature to reach at least 90\u00b0C for a sufficient time in order to achieve bacterial reduction, which is then followed by rapid cooling. Organic acid carcass washes (lactic, acetic and citric) were effective on -line interventions with higher reductions reported for lactic acid (1 -2 logs of natural microbiota) than for acetic and citric acid or their mixtures (usually up to 1 log). Therefore, based on the large amount of data generated on lactic acid efficacy, an average reduction of 1.5 log from lactic acid treatment of carcasse s can be expect ed. Page 24 of 164 A large number of studies conducted under pilot and laboratory conditions investigated various physical (water washes and thermal tr eatments) and chemical interventions (organic acids and other chemicals) alone or in combinations , report ing a large variation of reduction effects, very often between 2 -5 logs. This must be taken with caution and only as an indication of the potential intervention effect, because of the artificial nature of inoculated microorganisms, controlled study conditions and often low number of samples investigated. 3.3.3 Chilling The primary reason for chilling is inhibition of further bacterial growth and it is widely assumed not to have a significant reduction effect against bacteria. The review identified limited and inc onsistent effects of chilling at reducing microbial contamination . There is also a likely overestimation of reported lethal effect s of chilling on so me pathogens (p articularly mesophiles such as V TEC and Salmonella ), which sometimes have a poor recovery from an injure d state induced by the chilling; this could influence the interpretation of efficacy. In all reported studies (34 reviewed in total) , the temperatures investigated were within regulatory limits (i.e. from 0oC -5oC). Chilling for up to three da ys reduced levels of indicator bacteria in most cases up to only 0.5 logs under commercial conditions and up to 2 logs of inoculated E. coli and Salmonella under pilot and lab conditions. Chilling for one day of carcasses previously sprayed with organic ac ids or treated with hot water or steam on the slaughterline reduced indicator bacteria by 0.6-2.1 logs under commercial co nditions and up to 3.5 logs of E. coli under pilot and lab conditions . This is likely due to a residual effect of chemical interventio ns. An average 0.1 -0.2 log reduction per day of inoculated Salmonella during 14 -day dry aging of beef cuts was observed, leading to overall reductions of up to 2 logs of faecal indicators in the first four days of dry aging or around 1 -3 logs of inoculated enteric pathogen s after seven days of dry aging. Water spray chilling showed very variable effects and was largely ineffe ctive in reducing natural microbiota on carcasses in commercial conditions. However, reduction effects of up to 2 logs were observed o n inoculated V TEC and Salmonella, which increased when various chemicals were sprayed onto beef carcass cuts during chilling , producing reductions from 1 - 4.5 logs comparing to water spray chilling alone in only one reported study . 3.3.4 Post -chill and pre -fabric ation carcass treatments The review identified only nine studies that investigated interventions for beef carcasse s at this stage. Lactic acid spray of carcasses following the completion of chilling and prior to carcass fabrication was shown to statistically significantly reduce aerobic bacteria up to 3 log-cycles and faecal bacteria up to 1.5 logs in two studies cond ucted under commercial conditions , with reductions increasing to up to 7 logs of inoculated V TEC and Salmonella in five studies conducted unde r laboratory conditions. Page 25 of 164 One novel non -thermal intervention, electron beam (E -beam) irradiation, was reported in only one study to be highly efficacious at a 1 kGy dose, and when applied to chilled beef primals reduced E. coli O157:H7 numbers by up to 6.6 log -cycles. 3.3.5 Multiple on -line interventions and HACCP Sixteen studies investigated the s equential application of interventions after dehiding but before chilling , based on a 'multiple -hurdle approach' under commercial abattoir conditions. The interventions usually started with knife trimming and steam vacuuming which achieve reduction of bacteria on beef surfaces by targeting potentially contaminated areas following the dehiding process ( usually along the cattle hide opening lines). This is followed with a pre-evisceration wash of hot water or organic acid that further elimin ates pathogens. After evisceration and splitting, carcasses pass through a thermal pasteuris ation chamber, where heated water (>74oC) or steam (>85oC) is applied. This treatment is lethal to most bacteria on the carcass surface and further cleanses the car cass. Finally, a heated organic acid or peroxyacetic acid rinse is applied before carcasses enter the chilling room. Consistent reductions of naturally present bacterial indicators were achieved across a number of studies and were higher than when only one single intervention was used . In most cases they ranged from 2 -3 logs of ACC and/or f aecal indicators. T he p revalence of naturally present V TEC and Salmonella following sequential appli cation of interventions was in most cases statistically significantly reduced, often to levels below detection limits. In one controlled trial in a pilot plant where cattle hides were washed with lactic and acetic acid followed by carcass organic acid wash es prior to chilling, the reductions obtained and measured after chilling were in the range 1.5 -2 logs comparing to untreated (only chilled) carcasses. No overall effect of HAC CP implementation on pathogen (V TEC and Salmonella ) reduction was reported in e ight before -and-after studies. However, levels of ACC's and faecal indicator bacteria were reduced on carcasses by 0.5-1 log -cycle after HACCP implementation . 3.4 Post - carcass fabrication interventions 3.4.1 Standard pr ocessing procedures and GHP Three studies foun d an inconsistent effect of the carcass fabrication procedures, with trimming off potentially contaminated carcass sites showing some bacterial reduction , but also with an increased possibility for microbial cross -contamination. One study investigating post HACCP implementation in beef cutting plants indicated a reduc tion effect of 1 -2 logs of ACCs compared to before HACCP implementation. Regular sanitation with detergents and sanitisers is highly efficacious against residual microbiota with up to 3 log red uctions achieved on food contact surfaces. Overall, adherence t o GHP -based control measures is important to reduce bacterial contamination during the carcass fabrication process. Page 26 of 164 3.4.2 Interventions for beef primals, subprimals and trim Post -fabrication hazard -based interventions involve treatments of beef primals, subprimals and trim with various physical (hot water) or chemical substances. There is a limit to how high temperature and/or concentration of chemicals can be used in this final product so as to retai n acceptable sensory quality. However , these treatments can be used if properly optimised. The review identified 51 study that investigated interventions at this stage. Hot water wash and steam treatment of beef primals and trim had reduction effects of up to 2 logs of inoculated V TEC and Salmonella , whereas reductions of 0.5 -1 log were reported for ACC and faecal microbiota in seven reviewed studies . Using dry heat with a hot air gun at temperatures up to 100oC increased efficacy to 4 -6 logs reduc tions in inoculated V TEC and Salmonella in one study. Nevertheless, all these thermal treatments could have a detrimental effect on product quality if intervention parameters are not optimised. Research investigating various organic acids and other chemic als demon strated large variations in the magnitude of the effect. Lactic acid and other organic acids, alone or in a combination with other chemicals or hot water, were shown to have an efficacy of around 1-2 logs reduction of inoculated pathogens or natur al microb iota in 29 reviewed studies . Multiple treatments reported in only one study (hot water spray, hot air, lactic acid spray) , followed by vacuum storage , gave better reductions of natural aerobic and faecal microbiota which ranged from 1.6 -3.7 logs. Phage tre atment were efficacious against inoculated E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella in the range of 1 -2 logs in two studies . 3.4.3 Packaging and storage Packaging -based interventions for beef trim or minced beef are subject to many factors such as naturally present microb iota, temperature, storage time, pH and type of packaging. These were reviewed from a total of 43 studies. Cold aerobic storage up to sev en days reduced inoculated E. coli O157:H7 by 1.5 logs and natural aerobic microbiota by up to 0.5 logs in five reviewe d studies . Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and vacuum packaging are considered useful for extend ing the shelf life of beef trim and m inced beef. However, it had limited and not statistically significant reduction effect on inoculated E. coli O157:H7 of up to 0.4 logs, but in combination with lactic acid the effect increased to 2 logs in seven reviewed studies . The use of lactic acid bacteria ( Lactobacillus spp.) to control pathogens in the final products resulted in variable reductions of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 of up to 3 logs in minced beef in four reviewed studies . Nisin was mostly found to be effective against inoculated E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes (1-2 logs) ; similarly, phages achieved up to 1 log reduction in E. coli O157:H7 numbers . Irradiation appears to be one of the most effective interventions abl e to deliver complete elimination of inoculated pathogens, with reduction effects exceeding 6 logs (as reported in Page 27 of 164 seven reviewed studies) . Other emerging technologies such as high -pressu re processing produced highly variable reductions depending on the study conditions, ranging from 3 -5 logs, in nine reviewed studies . 3.5 Risk management considerations The primary objective of this study was to identify and recommend effective interventions in minced beef production chain. Most studies identified in the cour se of this review were conducted under laboratory co nditions that often reported a n exaggerated intervention efficacy in comparison with what would be expected in practice (i.e. often 1 -2 log-cycles better reduction effect of the same intervention than stu dies performed under commercial conditions) . Studies on industrial scale and pilot scale, with naturally contaminated products, provide more confidence in the efficacy of interventions. Therefore, where sufficient number of these studies were reported per intervention, the reductions achieved were used to draw the conclusions. There was an overall lack of reported controlled trials conducted under commercial conditions (only eight on cattle hide and fourteen on beef carcass interventions, out of 316 studies identified) , which hampers a proper estimation of the true effect of interventions. The relative log reductions of indicator bacteria for standard processing procedures and interventions reported to reduce microbial contamination on be ef carcass surfaces under commercial abattoir conditions are shown in Figure 1. They are presented as relative to E - beam irradiation of carcass surface, which was the only intervention reported to completely eliminate E. coli O157 from beef carcass (Arthur et al. 2005). These reductions include data from controlled and before -and-after trials investigating cattle hide interventions with the effect measured as reduction -in-transfer to resulting carcasses, as w ell as post -dehiding carcass interventions up to the carcass fabrication stage. Caution must be exercised when interpreting the efficacies of interventions, because some data are derived from multiple studies using different study designs where a range of reduction effects were reported. Furthermore, th ese reductions are based only on the observations from across different studies and the statistical analysis was not performed. A systematic literature review coupled with meta -analysis is one method that ca n be used to address differences between experime ntal methods and results within a body of literature (Greig et al. 2012, Zhilyaev et al. 2017 ). Then, the data obtained in this way can be used in quantitative risk modelling which enhances the confidence in risk predictions and provides a more evidenced -based model for public health analyses (Dodd et al. 2011, Smith et al. 2013). Page 28 of 164 Figure 1 . Relative log reductions for standard processing procedures and interventions reported to red uce indicator bacteria on beef carcass surfaces under commercial abattoir conditions, relative to E -beam irradiation (*reduction in hide -to-carcass transfer) Taking into consideration the relative efficacies of reported interventions, it could be argued that any intervention that has a statistically significant and consistent effect in reducing carcass microbial contamination can be considered as hazard -based and recommended for use, dependant on other contextual factors as well. According to EFSA (2010), the use of substance(s) for decontaminating treatments is considered efficacious when any reduction of the prevalence and/or numbers of pathogenic target microorganisms is statistically significant when compared to the control and, at the same time, this reduction has a positive impact on reduction of human illness cases . One way of assessing the latter aspect is to conduct a QMRA on the effects of interventions for given microbiological risk, such as a stochastic QMRA model for E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef and beef cuts discussed in the section below (Smith et al. 2013 ). Other factors usually taken into consideration are: i) the safety of the intended substance; ii) the effect as to the development of resistance to therapeutic antimic robials; and iii) the safety of the substance and its by -products for the environment (EFSA, 2010). With respect to the efficacy o f reviewed beef interventions, cattle hide interventions such as chemical washes with vacuuming and immobilisation treatments with shellac , had a statistically significant and consistent reduction effect reported in several studies (1-1.5 logs) . The use of these interventions could have the greatest effect on an overall reduction of carcass bacterial load as it reduces the risk o f hide to carcass cross -contamination, thus preventing major carcass contamination problems before even they occur . Furthermore, carcass pasteurisation treatments and organic (lactic) acid washes also produced a 00.511.522.533.544.5Page 29 of 164 consistent reduction effects seen across several studies, from 1 -2.5 logs , and, when in sequential use , up to a 3 logs reduction. Other interventions for which there is a lack of evidence (e.g. hide removal practices, bunging/rodding); that have shown inconsistent results in reducin g microbial contamination (particularly in respect to pathoge ns, e.g. hide cleanliness assessment, hide clipping, chilling); or where no processing parameters in reducing carcass contamination can be clearly established (e.g. environment , equipment and too ls sanitation , knife trimming and steam vacuuming ) can be use d as GHP -based control measures to assist in overall microbial reduction. All these measures are necessary in beef production premises and their use can often increase the efficacy of subsequently applied hazard -based intervention. For example, cattle hide clipping can enhance the efficacy of hide chemical washes or immobilisation treatment with shellac. It goes without saying that one shouldn't rely on the interventions' efficacy to counteract previous inadequate hygiene. The sequential application of interventions after dehiding but before chilling, based on a 'multiple -hurdle approach' under commercial abattoir conditions , delivered the highest reductions consistent across seven reported studies. Multiple interventions following the dehiding process usua lly involved some or all of the following: knife trimming, steam vacuuming, pre -evisceration washing, washing, thermal deco ntamination with water or steam a nd organic acid (or peroxyacetic acid) rinsing before chillin g. The reductions of naturally present bacterial indicators were higher than when only one single intervention was used and i n most cases they ranged from 2 -3 logs of ACC and/or faecal indicators. Also, t he prevalence of naturally present VTEC and Salmonella was in most cases statistically sig nificantly reduced, often to the levels below detection limits , in twelve reviewed studies . In only one study where cattle hide organic acid washes were inv estigated as a part of 'multiple -hurdle approach' (concurrently with beef carcass organic acid washe s) under pilot plant conditions , the reductions obtained and measured on beef carcasses after chilling were in the range 1.5 -2 logs compared to untreated (o nly chilled) carcasses (Van Ba et al . 2018) . In relative terms, the reductions shown in F igure 1 correlate to some extent to the ones reported in systematic reviews and m eta-analyse s on interventions in beef for Salmonella and E. coli (Greig et al. 2012, FAO 2016, Zhilyaev et al. 2017) . In the m eta-analysis on th e effect of interventions use d in cattle processing plants to reduce E. coli contamination , Zhilyaev et al. (2017) analysed data both from studies perfor med under commercial conditions and from pilo t and laboratory studies. They found l east -squares mean reductions of E. coli (log CFU/cm2) on beef surfaces of 1.44 [95% CI: 0.73 -2.15] [2.46 -3.73] for steam vacuum and 1.90 [1.33 -2.47] for water was h. There is a certain discrepancy between their results and those presented in Page 30 of 164 Figure 1 which might be due to an exaggerated intervention efficacy from the pilot plant and laboratory studies these authors analysed. In another systematic review and meta -analysis performed by Greig et al . (2012), a stochastic simulation model was used to evaluate combined effects of carcass water was h, steam or hot water pasteurisation and a 24 h dry chilling on E. coli . The authors analysed only studies conducted under comme rcial conditions to reduce E. coli numbers or prevalence on beef carcasses. The study found that final was h using potable water, pasteuris ation with steam or hot water with or without an acid treatment, and dry chilling are effective interventions for red ucing generic E. coli contamination of finished beef carcasses. Pasteurisation had the single largest impact on decreasing the prevalence of E. coli contaminated carcasses, as well as the concentration of E. coli on the carcasses. It was reported that the steam pasteuris ation was as effective as hot water pasteuris ation. Further decrease in prevalence of E. coli was noticed after application of lactic acid (no data on the effect on E. coli levels were available) . Retzlaff et al. (2005) recommended optimum operating temperature in a steam chamber of 87.8oC and a minimum temperature of 85oC for 10 sec as a critical limit , when steam pasteurisation is employed as a critical control point in a HACCP -based system . In a s imilar systematic review and meta- analysis performed by Young et al. (2016) , it was reported that prechill hot water washes and steam pasteuris ation are effective for reducing Salmonella contamination on beef carcasses ( FAO, 2016; Young et al. 2016) . One QMRA model was developed in Canada and used to quantitatively assess the relative impacts of specific interventions on public health risks from consumption of E. coli O157:H7 in beef products (Smith et al. 2013) . This Q MRA model provides a useful tool to compare relative efficacies of different interventions to determine their potential impact on public health risks. To quantify the impacts of various interventions appli ed at processing level on concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 on cattle carcasses, the authors used data from a systematic review and meta- analysis published by Greig et al . (2012). They found that any intervention (excluding carcass water spray chill) applied at processing level significantly reduced the probability of illness from E. coli O157:H7 consumed in undercooked minced beef and beef cuts, compared to applying no interventions. The average probability of illness per serv ing of minced beef and beef cuts following application of single intervention at slaughter (excluding carcass water spray chill) was reduced by 45% -92% and 44 %-96.5%, respectively . Generally, single process ing interventions reduced risks more than single pre -harvest interventions (use of probiotics and/or vaccine) . Combinations of interv entions, such as the use of pre -harvest interventions followed by sequential use of interventions at slaughter (pre -eviscer ation hot water wash, post -evisceration h ot water wash, s team pasteurization and a cid spray chill) , had the Page 31 of 164 greatest impact and reduced the average probability of illness per serving of minced beef and non- intact beef cuts by 95%- 99.6 % and 95%- 99.9%, respe ctively, relative to the no intervention scenario (Smith et al . 2013). The authors also concluded that the scenarios investigated that related to the current practices in Canada (i.e. pre -evisceration hot water wash followed by post -evisceration h ot water wash , steam pasteurization and a cid spray chill ) were effective at reducing risks from consumption of E. coli O157:H7 in beef products , with a verage probabilities of illness per serving of 8.7 x 10-6, 3.3 x 10-8, and 2.9 x 10-9 for g round beef, non- intact beef cuts, and intact beef cuts, respectively . In another QMRA model, Dodd et al. (2011) evaluated the effects of multiple concurrent pre-harvest interventions and interventions at slaughter for E. coli O157 on the risk of beef carcass contamin ation . In this model, beef interventions were not individually evaluated but rather as a part of larger intervention category (i.e. grouped as cattle hide and carcass interventions ). The authors used prevalence parameters and estimated that the risk of E. coli O157 carcass contamination was conditional , among various pre-harvest factors , on the transport and lairage effects, hide intervention s, and carcass interventions . Sensitivity analyses reve aled that fa ecal prevalence, f aecal-to-hide trans fer, hide -to-carcass transfer, and carcass intervention efficacy significantly affected the risk of carcass contamination (correlation coefficients of 0.37, 0.56, 0.58, and 20.29, respectively). The results indicated that combinations of pre -harvest interv entions are important for supplementing interventions at slaughter, but also emphasise the importance of lairage, cattle hide and beef carcass interventions for controlling E. coli O157 (Dodd et al . 2011) . When implementing such interventions , various fact ors should be take n into account . Interventions during processing should be designed to minimise the introduction of additional contamination and to reduce or eliminate t he existing one. T he sources of overall carcass contamination and, in particular, the quantification of their contribution to the contamination at the lairage stage and at slaughter and post -slaughter events is not a well- researched area. There are no data of the relative contributio n of accidental gut spillage, airborne contamination and contamination from other indirect sources (workers, equipment), but it can be assumed that these events are highly likely plant specific and would differ in various environments. Cattle hide is t he o nly constant and frequent contamination source for which sufficient research data h as been generated . Even in the abattoirs performing at the best standards , contamination from hides occurs regularly (Antic et al . 2011). Studies on the quantification of this contamination suggest that up to 1% in commercial and 10% in lab conditions of microbial contamination is transferred to carcasses (Bacon et al . 2000, Arthur et al . 2004, Antic et al . 2018). Also, the resulting microbiological status of the carcass es often mirrors that of the hides prior to dehiding (Blagojev ic et al. 2011) . Given the proactive Page 32 of 164 nature of current FSMS , it is clear that the first priority should be prevention of microbiological contamination . This also should be in line with the whole chain approach and controls implemented in an integrated way , starting from the farm. One molecular study has shown, through prevalence determination and isolate genotyping with pulsed - field gel electrophoresis, that survival of E. coli O157:H7 on the hides of live cattle is relatively short , with an approximate duration of 9 days or less (Arthur et al. 2011) . The results of this study suggest that any pre -harvest interventions that are to be administered at the end of the finishing period will achieve the maximum effect in reducing E. coli O157:H7 l evels on cattle hides if given nine days before the cattle are presented for processing in the lairage . However, any contamination events during lairaging due to poor lairage cle aning practices or inadequate cattle handling, would give rise to additional hide contamin ation and negate effects of pre -harvest interve ntions (Small et al. 2002, Small et al. 2003). The main driver for the implementation of interventions in beef processing premises should be the protection of public health from the most significant microbial haza rds. The United States food safety policy of declaring E. coli O157:H7 an adulterant (i.e., a prohibited contaminant) in raw ground beef has resulted in substantial changes in the approach to FSMS implemented at the beef processing stage , including require ment for mandatory implementation of the HACCP system (FSIS, 1993; 1996) . The improved hygienic slaughter practices and implementation of additional controls are designed to reduce the likelihood of pathogen presence at detectable levels . The implementation of such control s was based on the preference of some consumers in the USA for lightly cooked ground beef. The adulterant policy was fundamental in forcing a technological solution s at this stage of the beef chain , to introduce various interventions such as pasteurisation trea tments, lactic and other organic acids, and other suitable chemicals as treatment options for decontaminating carcasses and beef trim. Due to their temporary effect, such decontaminants are not considered to be food additives but rather processing aids. These chemical treatments are used with the understanding that there must be no measurable chemical residue on the carcass and that the treatment effect in reducing microbial contamination is temporary . The FSA's position is that the FBOs serving LTTC burgers should ensure that their suppliers must have documented and validated procedures in place throughout the supply chain (during slaughter, cutting and mincing ), that can achieve at least a 4 log reduction before the burger is served to the final consumer (FSA, 2015, 2016). When considering all available evidences generated in this review, no single intervention, apart from E -beam irradiation, can realistically deliver 4 logs reduction of microbiota on carcasses or beef cuts. However, the sequential application of interventions, based on a 'multiple -hurdle approach', was able Page 33 of 164 to deliver the highest reductions which were consistent across seven reviewed studies conducted under commercial abattoir conditions . The reductions in numbers o f naturally present bacterial indicators , when multiple beef carcass interventions from post -dehiding to pre -chill stage were used, in most cases ranged from 2 -3 logs of ACC and/or faecal indicators , and in some studies up to 4 logs . Also, t he intervention effects against naturally present VTEC and Salmonella , measured in prevalence estimates in twelve reviewed studies , were in most cases statistically significant , and the presence of these pathogens was often reduced to the levels below detect ion limits . Therefore, the reductions were higher than when only one single intervention was used and the overall improvement of the microbiological status of beef was determined by a combination of microbial reductions achieved by all interventions. Never theless, a part from one study conducted in pilot plant (that investigated sequential use of one hide and one carcass intervention ), no other studies investigating cattle hide interventions, interventions during chilling and in post- chill stage as a part of an overall ' multiple hurdle approach' alongside beef carcass interventions, were identified in this review. Some of the reviewed hazard -based interventions in abovementioned stages (for example chemical hide washes and microbial immobilisation treatment with shellac , and organic acid washes of car casses and beef cuts post- chill) were often able to deliver additional 1 -2 logs of microbial reductions . Therefore, it can be expected that the 4 logs performance criterion can be achieved in the minced beef pro duction chain , at the FBOs which supply meat for LTTC burger s. This is possible if sequential application of the interventions is utilised, in an integrated and coordinated way. The 'multiple -hurdle approach' in this case would rely on properly implemented prerequisite GHP -based measures in place , for example lairage cleaning, proper cattle handling in the lairage, hide cleanliness assessment , carcass knife trimming and steam vacuuming alongside careful hide removal and bunging/rodding . This can then extend to the hazard -based cattle hide interventions ( chemical hide washes or microbial immobilisation treatment ), beef carcass interventions at slaughter ( pasteurisation treatments with hot water and/or steam and organic acid washes ) and carcass intervent ions at chill/post -chill stage ( organic acid washes of carcasses); concluding with interventions for beef cuts post- chill ( organic acid washes ), and also interventions in packaging stage (MAP and vacuum packaging of meat with added lactic acid ). The compr -hurdle approach', may be able to reduce microbial loads sufficiently to offer the same level of protection to consumers from burgers, which are produced with these interventions and are served LTTC as tha t of thoroughly cook ed burgers originating from conventional minced beef production chain. Page 34 of 164 3.6 Recommendations and future work On the basis of the work undertaken during this review , the options for delivering the required level of protection to consumers of LTTC burgers have been identified and are summarised below. Recommendations are made on areas that merit further research efforts. Cattle hide interventions, such as chemical hide washes and microbial immobilisation tre atment with shellac , have been identified as efficacious and able to deliver 1 -1.5 logs reduction in transfer of bacteria to carcasses. They can be recommended for consideration as hazard -based interventions when applied post - exsanguination and before dehi ding for reducing microbial contamination of resulting beef carcasses . Beef carcass interventions, such as pasteurisation treatments with hot water and/or steam , have been identified as efficacious and able to deliver 1 -2.5 logs reduction. Also, organic (lactic) acid washes can deliver 1 -1.5 logs reduction. When both interventions are in in sequential use, they can deliver up to a 3 logs reduction . Both carcass pasteurisation treatments and organic (lactic) acid washes can be recommended for consideration as hazard -based interventions when applied after dehiding and pre -chill. Organic (lactic) acid washes have also been identified as efficacious when applied on beef carcasses during chilling and at post -chill, pre -fabrication stage, and able to deliver around 1.5 logs reduction. They can be recommended for cons ideration as hazard -based interventions when applied on carcasses at these stages. Interventions for beef cuts and minced beef at the post- slaughter stage, such as organic acid washes, MAP and vacuum packaging of meat (with added lactic acid), have been id entified as efficacious and able to deliver up to 2 logs reduction. They can be recommended for consideration as hazard -based interventions when applied at the final product, but only if properly optimised to retain the quality of the product. There are c ertain interventions for which there is a lack of ev idence (e.g. hide removal practices, bunging/rodding); that have shown inconsistent results in reducing microbial contamination (particularly in respect to pathogens, e.g. hide cleanliness assessment, hid e clipping, chilling); or where no processing parame ters in reducing carcass contamination can be clearly established (e.g. environment, equipment and tools sanitation, knife trimming and steam vacuuming ). These interventions can be recommended for use as GHP -based control measures , alongside hazard -based i nterventions, to assist in overall microbial reduction . Page 35 of 164 The s equential use of beef carcass interventions as a part of 'multiple -hurdle approach' (knife trimming, steam vacuuming, pasteurisat ion treatments and organic acid washes) delivered higher reductions than any of the interventions applied alone , from 2 to 3 logs . Therefore, the sequential use of GHP - and hazard -based carcass interventions can be recommended for consideration, particularly when they are used alongside other re commended interventions at pre -slaughter, slaughter and post- slaughter stage . In order to address differences in study designs and results on the intervention efficacies between multiple studies identified in this review, further meta -analysis of data generated in this study is needed. This, coupled with subsequent use of data in quantitative risk modelling can enhance the confidence of the contribution of beef interventions in the reduction of microbial load to meet required performance criteria, and woul d provide a more evidence -based model for public health analyses . The relative lack of data was found on the interventions in the pre-slaughter stage, particularly cattle handling in the lairage and hazard -based bacteriophage trea tment for cattle hides . Also, more data are needed on cattle hide interventions post - exsanguination and carcass interventions during chilling and at post chill, pre - fabrication stage. N ovel emerging techno logies for beef cuts and minced beef, such as elect ron beam and gamma irradiation, high -pressure processing and bacteriophage treatments, merit further investigation. There was an overall lack of large controlled trials conducted under commercial condition s, particularly investigating multiple beef interve ntions at slaughter, prior to dehiding to pre - fabrication stage . These are the areas where f urther research is needed to fill the knowledge gaps. Page 36 of 164 4 References Antic, D., Blagojevic, B. and Buncic, S.

Page 39 of 164 Annex 1 : Efficacy of interventions in minced beef production chain 1 Methods 1.1 Review approach, question and scope The review considered all evidence on beef intervention efficacy available in the publ ic domain, including primary research , previously published syste matic reviews, risk assessments and stochastic models. Only primary research2 studies were used for detailed data extraction and reporting. Previously published syste matic reviews and narrative literature reviews on similar topics were used to define specific intervention categories and to cross check data (where similar interventions were reviewed) (Loretz et al. 2011, FAO 2016, Young et al. 2016) . All main research literature types were included in review : peer reviewed articles published in journals, c onference papers, government and industry reports and theses. The review question was: \"What is the efficacy of all possible interventio ns to control microbiological contamination in beef and beef processing environment at any stage in minced beef producti on chain from cattle receive d in abattoir to the packaging and storage inclusive? \" The population of interest included all cattle produced for domestic meat consumption, including their carcasses at processing and finished products (beef trim and ground/minced beef) . Also, population of interest included potential sources of beef contamination during processing (i.e. cattle hides, environ ment surfaces and tools/knives/equipment). Any interventions3 applied from cattle receive d in ab attoir up to and inclusive of finished product packaging and storage (minced beef production chain) were considered relevant. Relevant o utcome measures for inte rventions were the effectiveness of each intervention in reducing log levels of indicator bacter ia (aerobic colony counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts, total coliform counts and generic E. coli counts, where data was available) and log levels of foodborne pa thogens (primarily E. coli O157 and other non- O157 VTEC serogroups and Salmonella, other perfringens , where data was available). 2 Primary research is defined as original research during which authors generated and reported their own data. 3 Interventions are actions taken during beef processing to reduce microbial contamination of carcasses: for e xample, surface trimming or lactic acid wash Page 40 of 164 1.2 Search strategy and information sources A comprehensive search algorithm was developed and used for the search of peer -reviewed literature (Appendix A). The algorithm was developed by extracting key words from a selection of 2 0 known re levant articles on beef interventions (different articles per intervention category), and by reviewing and adapting search strategies and key terms of previously published reviews and risk assessments on this and similar topics (Wilhelm et al. 2011, Greig et al. 2012, FAO 2016) . Key terms were combined using the Boolean operator \"OR\" into categories for Pathogen /Outcome (microorganism terms), In tervention (intervention terms) and Population (beef /hide/tools terms), and the categories were combined using the \"AND\" operator (Appendix A) . Algorithms were pre -tested i n Scopus and CAB Direct to ensure that a known list of 2 5 relevant articles (five per broad intervention categories) could be sufficiently identified (Appendix A) . Final searches were implemented in the bibliographic databases Scopus , CAB Direct, Agricola and PubMed on 14 September 2018 . Updated search was also conducted on 0 5 December 2018 to check for any literature published after the first search so to in clude all relevant articles published in 2018 (the updated search did not retrieve any eligible articles for the review). No language restriction was imposed, but only literature from 1996 to date was searched . The reason only articles published after 1996 were included was because it was considered that the evidence on interventions published prior to this period was not reflective enough of current industry conditions and practices . Also, mandated HACCP regulation came into force in 1996 and was followed with later requirements for in -plant validation on interventions with many research studies published after this date. Searc h verification was conducted by reviewing the reference lists of a selection of relevant review and primary research articles (22 in total, Appendix A), reviewing relevant conference proceedings and thro ugh targeted searches in Google to identify potential grey literature (e.g. government and industry reports and theses ). All details of internet searches for relevant grey literature citations are presented in Appendix A. 1.3 Relevance screening and eligibility criteria The relevance of each unique citation was assessed at the title and abstract level using form developed and modified from FAO (2016) (Appendix B). Citations describing research evaluating the efficacy and/or effectiveness of interventions to control microbiological contamination in beef and beef processing environment at any stage in minced beef production chain from cattle receive d in ab attoir to the packaging and storage inclusive , were considered relevant and passed to the next stage. As potentially relevant for this review, citations describing interventions in sheep/lambs /goats, narrative reviews and studies on microbiological contamination in beef processing environment, were retained to Page 41 of 164 be used for search verification and/or to describe contextual factors relevant for this review. The data on the intervention efficacy fr om sheep/lambs/goats intervention studies were not further analy sed as these were considered not reflective enough of beef interventions. 1.4 Relevance confirmation and prioritisation Citations passing the previous relevance -screening step wer e procured as f ull articles and confirmed for relevance using another pre -speci fied form (Appendix B). This form was used to characterize articles according to the document type, region, study design and setting, stage in food chain and intervention categories investigat ed and outcomes investigated. All experimental and observational study designs4 were considered for detailed data extraction (these include controlled trials, challenge trials and before -and-after trials , and cross -sectional studies ). Therefore, all study designs measuring intervention efficacy through concentration (e .g. colony forming units 'CFU'/ sample) and/or prevalence (presence or absence) of indicator or pathogenic microorganisms were considered. Intervention application settings were described as commercial (large or small) abattoirs and pilot plants, as well as rese arch conducted under laboratory conditions as long as it was applied on specific target population (i.e. cattle hides, carcass meat, beef trim, ground/minced beef, tools/knives). The interventions were categorised into the three main stages of minced beef production chain: i) abattoir (pre -slaughter); ii) abattoir (slaughter and post- slaughter ); and iii) post -abattoir. Also, they were presented as per four main interve ntion categories: i) lairage interventions; ii) cattle hide interventions; iii) beef carcass interventions; and iv) post - carcass fabrication interventions. 4 Experimental study : Each subject is assigned to a treated group or a control group before the start of the treatment. Lab trials are executed under highly controlled conditions. Field/commercial (abattoir) trials are executed under less controlled and more \"real\" conditions. Observational study: Assignment of subjects into a treated group versus a control group is outside the con trol of the invest igator. Controlled trial : Subjects are allocated to intervention/ comparison groups and evaluated for outcomes (natural pathogen exposure). Challenge trial : Similar to controlled, but subjects are artificially challenged or exposed to the disease agent and then allocated to the intervention groups for evaluation of the outcome (artificial pathogen exposure). Before- and-after trial : Observations (for intervention outcome ) are made on a population before and after receiving an intervention. Cross- sectional st udy: Examines the relationship of a risk factor and outcome (dise ase) at a point in time on representative samples of the target population. Page 42 of 164 'In vitro' studies and/or trials (m odel broth system experiments ) were excluded because this setting does not reflect specific target population and/or commercial processing condition s. Also, in the post - carcass fabrication stage, interventions on beef subjected to mechanical tenderization, moisture enhancement, marination or restructuring , as well as other processes that would make beef unsuitable for use in minced beef production5, were excluded from the review. Investigated outcomes other than previously mentioned (e.g. spoilage) were also excluded. Articles written in language other than English where there wasn't sufficient information presented in English language to extract, wer e also excluded. Where information in articles were presented only in v isual form , such as graphs, and no other extractable data were present i n the text, data on microbial reduction were not considered due to reduced precision and articles were excluded. 1.5 Data extraction Detailed data extracti ons were conducted for prioritis ed articles using pre -specified tools (Appendix B ). The data extraction tool included targeted questions about interventi on and population descriptions, outcomes measured, comparison group(s) and intervention efficacy results . 5 Minced beef : Boned beef that has been minced into fragments and contains less than 1% salt. In the case of beef m inced meat produced from chilled meat, the requirements specified in the hygiene regulations are that it must be prepared: i) within no more than six days of animal slaughter or ii) within no more than 15 days from the date of slaughter of the animals in the case of boned, vacuum -packed beef and veal EC (2004) 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for on the hygiene of foodstuffs', Official Journal of the European Union L , 47, 55 -205. . Page 43 of 164 1.6 Data analysis and reporting Results of primary research studies were summaris ed narratively and shown in tabular form , per stage in the minced beef production chain and intervention categories . For studies that measured concentration outcomes (e.g. log CFU/cm2), intervention efficacy results are pres ented as mean log reductions in the intervention compared with the control group. For studies measuring prevalence outcomes (positive vs negative), intervention effi cacy results are pres ented as the change in a microorganism prevalence due to the intervention in the included studies .

In total, 316 relevant article s were used for data extraction and reporting in this review. More articles were identified in t he abattoir (slaughter and post -slaughter) stage (63%), wit h significantly less in the pre -slaughter stage (lairage intervention s, only 7.7%). Around 2/3 of studies were conducted in North America (USA and Canada), and roughly half of them in laboratory conditions (these predominantly challenge trials). This is not surprising because the focus of microbial hazards control in USA an d Canada has been at the process ing level through the implementation of HACCP -pathogen reduction programmes. Controlled , before -and-after trials and cross -sectional studies in commercial conditions were reported in around 40% of articles . The most research ed population were beef carcasse s in pre -chill stage ( 90 articles, 25% ) followed by interventions in post -carcass fabrication stage (beef primals, subprimals, trim and minced beef , 51 article s, 15% ). Cattle hide interventions pre - and post- exsanguination were reported in 39 articles in total (2 articles reporting on both stages). There was a striking disproportion of published studies on lairage interventions and Page 48 of 164 standard processing practices comparing to hazard- based interventions for hides, carcasses and meat (i.e. 48 vs 293, respectiv ely). The results on the intervention efficacies are presented in the following sections grouped as per different Intervention Category (IC), and then subdivided into intervention subcategories. A short summary of key findings (brief synopsis of the infor mation covered in the section, including key take -home me ssages and overall implications) and intervention descriptions are also provided in each section, concluding each section with the list of references cited in each intervention category. The results on the intervention effects are presented in the tables and/or as a narrative description, per intervention stage/category/subcategory and presented separately for challenge trials ( those conducted under the lab /pilot conditions) and controlled/before -and- after trials (those usually conducted under comme rcial/pilot conditions) . Each table indicates information regarding : study setting and design ; number of studies; intervention and outcome sample; comparison group; outcome/microorganism, quantitative interv ention effect and references. Study setting can be either in commercial conditions (abattoir) or in more controlled environment s (research/pilot plant or laboratory). Study design can be controlled trial (natural pathogen exposure), challenge trial (artificial pathogen exposure) and before -and- after trial (effect measured before and after receiving an intervention ). The number of studies indicates the number of studies where the respective intervention is investigated and reported. The intervention sample indicates the sample type to which the intervention was applied (hide, beef, processing environment, tools). The outcome sample indicates the sample type that was subsequently measured for microbial contamination. In most cases thes e two samples were the same, but sometimes they differ, e.g. cattle hide interventions where the effect is measured on resulting beef carcass surfaces (reduction -in-transfer) or carcass interventions where the effect is measured in the resulting product (c uts, trim, mince) . The co mparison group refers to the control group to whi ch the intervention is compared and is usually: i) no treatment (controlled trials and challenge trials); ii) a reference treatment, usually water (again controlled and challenge trials); and iii) the 'before' or pre - intervention sample for 'before -and-after' trials. The intervention effect f or the studies that measured concentration outcomes are pres ented as a range of values of mean log reductions in the intervention compared with the control group . Log re duction ( short for logarithmic reduction ) is a ten -fold reduction of number of bacteria (e.g. 1 log reduction = 90% reduction; 4 log reduction = 99.99% reduction ; 6 log reduction = 99.9999% reduction ). For the studies measuring pre valence Page 49 of 164 outcomes (positiv e vs negative), intervention efficacy results are pres ented as the change in a microorganism prevalence due to the intervention in the included studies . Page 50 of 164 IC 1: L airage interventions IC 1.1 Summary of key findings IC 1.1.1 Lairage cleaning Several obse rvational studies of lairage cleaning and disinfection practices found that the lairages in the UK were washed commonly with cold water only , with no detergents and/or disinfectants. Foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella , E. coli O157 and Campylobacter are regularly found on lairage surfaces, even after routine cleansing operations, sometimes containing numbers of up to 104 organisms per sampled area (2,500 cm2). Up to a 5 log - cycles of microbial reduction can be achieved on lairage surfaces using pressur e water wash with q uaternary ammonium sanitisers and/or steam under pressure. IC 1.1.2 Cattle handling in lairage No investigations on specific interventions applied at this stage were identified. In total, eight observational and molecular studies invest igated t he importance of lairage as a risk factor for cattle hide (and subsequently carcass) microbial contamination . A study of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella in cattle conducted in USA found an increase in prevalence of both pathogens between pen on- farm and at the abattoir and that the majority of isolates from both hides and carcasses at slaughter genotypically matched those from abattoir lairage, and not those from the farm of origin. In another two USA studies, risk factors identified for increased od ds of hide contamination with Salmonella and E. coli O157 were holding cattle in lairages contaminated with cattle faeces and positive for these path ogens . On the other hand, t hree studies conducted in the UK, Ireland and Australia did not find that the lairage lead to an increase in the number or isolation rate of VTEC and Salmonella from cattle hides or carcasses . Extensive hide and carcass cross -contamination from the lairage environment was found in one study using marker organism inoculated on hides and lairage surfaces. One observational study reported on the opportunities for hide cross -contamination during lairaging and found that the important risk factors were the number of animals in the lot and the animals' stocking density . IC 1.1.3 Hide cleanli ness assessment The relationship between cattle hide cleanliness and microbiological status of derived beef carcasses have been investigated in only five cross -sectional studies conducted under commercial condition in Ireland, Italy, Norway (two studies) and Serbia. Scoring of hide cleanliness was performed according to the similar scoring systems that are used in the UK, Ireland and Norway. In all but one study, a direct correlation between visual hide cleanliness category and microbial contamination of re sulting beef carcasses were found for microbiological indicators o f general (ACC) and faecal contamination (EBC and E. coli ). There Page 51 of 164 was a steady trend of de crease in carcass microbial load by 0.5 -3 log-cycles of ACC, 0.7-1.5 logs of EBC and 0.4 -0.8 logs of generic E. coli with the increase in hide cleanliness . Therefore, this GHP measure appears to be efficacious in reducing bacterial transfer from dirty hides to resulting carcasses. IC 1.1.4 Cattle hide interventions (pre -exsanguination) In total, eight s tudies were identified describing research on live animal hide int erventions. Four studies that investigated live animals hide washes, with or without chemicals (cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), lactic acid and chlorine) , found that hide water wash with amb ient temperature water was ineffective at reducing microbial load and had highly variable efficacy . On the other hand, washing with CPC yielded promising reductions in hide - to-carcass transfer of ACC and EBC by 1.5 and 1.1 logs , respectively , and reduced prevalence of naturally present E. coli O157 (from 23% in con trol to 3% in carcasses whose hides had been washed) . The use of chemicals for cattle hide treatments was suggested to be more appropriate on hide s post -exsanguination due to animal welfare concer ns. Only one study that investigated hide clipping found very moderate reductions in transfer of ACC to carcass of up to 0.3 logs. Two lab studies on bacteriophage spray application reported up to 2 log reduction of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 on cattle hid e sections after 1 h contact time , whereas one stu dy under commercial condition found no reductions in E. coli O157:H7 prevalence. Apart from the phage treatment for which certain contact time with the hide is required for the full intervention effect, oth er interventions (washing and clipping) are more appropriate for use post- exsanguination. Page 52 of 164 IC 1.2 Intervention description Lairage refers to holding facilities (p ens, yards and other holding areas ) used for accommodating animals in order to give them n ecessary attention (such as water, feed, rest) before they are moved on or used for specific purposes , including slaughter .

Hide cle anliness assessment : refers to the scoring and categorisation of hide cleanliness befo re cattle slaughter according to the established objective system, and actions taken in case animals are too dirty to be processed hygienically. Cattle hide interventions (pre -exsanguination) : refers to all procedures in place which are available for use ante mortem to deal with animals that are excessively soiled , but not to compromise animal welfare.

Bacteriophage treatment : Treatment with bacteriophages (phages) , which are viruses that infect and kil l bacteria. Page 53 of 164 IC 1.3 Lairage cleaning Several observational studies of lairage cleaning and disinfection practices were found and one challenge study applied at the lairage stage . In the study of Small et al. (2003) , the cleaning pract ices in 17 UK abattoirs slaughtering cattle were investigated using questi onnaire s and validated through subsequent visits . The authors report that bedding was used in the majority of lairages and was changed either between animal batches, daily, weekly or monthly. Approximately, one quarter of lairages investigated were washed daily , commonly with cold water with no detergents and/or disinfectants . The authors concluded that the cleaning and disi nfection protocols employed, in general, were unlikely to eli minate the microbial load. Small et al. (2002) reported the o verall prevalence of E. coli O157 and Salmonella spp. in UK cattle lairages of 7.2 and 6.1%, respectively , and an increase in E. coli O157 and Salmone lla prevalence in environmental samples from 6.7% and 1.1% , before work in ab attoir started , to 7.8% and 11.1%, during working hours , respectively , for both pathogens. In another study, they found 6.5% of lairage samples positive for Salmonella (after routine cleansing operations at the end of the previous day's processing ), contai ning esti mated numbers of up to 104 organisms per sampled area (50 by 50 cm) (Small et al. 2006) . In the study of Small et al. (2007a) , authors showed that microbial contamination often remains in UK lairage holding pens after routine cleaning operations, with up to 2.8 lo g CFU/cm2 of E. coli remaining at some sites . In their subsequent study authors investigated cleaning method s for concrete surfaces under various conditions using pressure water with or without sanitising agent and/or steam (Small et al. 2007b) . The reductions achieved o n surfaces of inoculated E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.9-5.2 log CFU/cm2 and 0.9-5.8 log CFU/cm2, respectively, depending on treatment applied. Pressure wash followed by steam and sanitiser appeared to have had the greatest reduction effect. Page 54 of 164 IC 1.4 Cattle handling in lairage The importance of lairage as a risk factor for cattle hide (and subsequently carcass) microbial contamination has been investigated in a few observational and molecular studies , but no specific intervention has been a pplied at this step . It has been speculated that prolonged holding times in lairage lead s to increased contamination of the animals' coats . Change in Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 prevalence in cattle between pen on- farm and at the abattoir was shown in t he study of Arthur et al. (2008a) , with increase s from 0.7% and 66% on farm to 74.2% and 76.8% in the lairage , respectively for each pathogen. Also, application of pulsed field gel electrophoresis methodology demonstrated that 46.9% and 65.1% of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella hide isolates were attributable solely to the lairage environment, whereas 67% and 30% of the carcass E. coli O157:H7 and Sal monella isolates, respectively, could be attributed solely to the lairage environment (Arthur et al. 2008a) . Dewell et al. (2008a) reported that l ots of cattle held in E. coli O157 -posit ive lairage pens had eight times greater risk of having positive slaughter hide samples compared with cattle held in culture -negative pens ( RR=8.0; 95% CI (1.6-38.8) ). Furthermore, a lot of cattle that were held in lairage pens contaminated with faeces had three times greater risk for positive slaughter hide samples co mpared with cattle held in clean pens ( RR=3.1; 95% CI (1.2 -7.9)). The same authors reported similar findings regarding Salmonella (Dewell et al. 2008b) , where it was fo und that slaughter cattle spendi ng time in dirty lairage had greater risk of Salmonella- positive hides at slaughter relative to those in clean lairag e (RR = 1.83, 95% CI (0.7-3.14) ). All these finding s highlight the importance of lairage in trans mission of hide - level contamination . This can be reduced by minimising the duration in lairage for cattle in commercial settings, which is not always a practical measure. On t he other hand, Fegan et al. (2009) did not find that lairage lead to an increase in the number or isolation rate of E. coli O157 from cattle , which was supported by the study of Minihan et al. (2003a) . Furthermore , time in lairage was a non -significant predictor for Salmonella or VTEC contaminati on of beef carcasses , reported in a cross -sectional study of Salmonella in carcasses in UK abattoirs (Milnes et al. 2009) . Extensive hide and carc ass cross- contamination from the lairage environment was found in one small study by Coll is et al. (2004) . The authors found an increase in the presence of a hide marker inoculated onto the hides of 11% of cattle at unloading , to 100% (hide before skinning) and 88.8% (skinned carcass) samples . Also, the environmental surface marker inoculated on to lairage pens, races, and stunning box was detected on 83.3% (hide before skinning) and 88.8% (skinned carcass ) samples. The extensive spread of microbial contamination between animals fr om di fferent holding pens in that study was likely med iated by post- pen environmental surfaces, races and stunning boxes . Page 55 of 164 Small and Buncic (2009) investigated the opportunities for hide cross -contamination to occur during lairage of cattle. At unloading, there was a statistically significant association between the number of animals in the lot and the number of contacts they made with the unloading bay structures and other animals . Also , the frequency of contacts inc reased as the animals' stocking density increased. Animals at lower stocking de nsities were much less likely to suffer incidents of cross -contamination by direct contact than the animals at high stocking densities . On average there were more contacts per animal per minute in the first 10 minutes of holding, while the cattl e explored their new surroundings. Page 56 of 164 IC 1.5 Hide cleanliness assessment The relationship between cattle hide cleanliness and microbiological statu s of derived beef carcasses has been investigated in severa l studies. Scoring of hide cleanliness befo re cattle slaughter in practice varies in different countries such as the UK, Ireland, Norway and Australia (McEvoy et al. 2000, Hughes 2001, Kiermeier et al. 2006, Hauge et al. 2012) . Most studies shown that visually dirty cattle produce carcasses with higher microbial counts than clean cattle . In the study of Blagojevic et al. (2012) , the me an aerobic colony counts (ACC) and Enterobacteriaceae load of hides and final carcases differed statistically significantly between very dirty cattle (category 4) and less dirty or clean cattle (categories 1, 2 and 3 scored according to the UK scoring syst em), with an increase in carcass bacterial load by 1.1 and 0.7 log, respectively , with increased hide dirtiness . Hauge et al. (2012) reported a statistically significant difference in ACC between carcasses derived from clean animals and moderately dirty animals (on a three -category scale). The reduction in ACC was 0.5 -0.9 logs and in generic E. coli 0.4-0.7 logs. There was no statistical difference for ACC and E. coli counts betw een clean and very dirty animal groups. This was partly explained by the fact that very dirty cattle were dehided more carefully. Similar observation was made in their later study conducted in two commercial abattoirs where carcass swabs after dehiding showed no statistically significant difference in the number of generic E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae between clean and very dirty cattle (Hauge et al. 2015) . Authors hypothesised that this finding could be plant dependant and due to more careful dehiding of very dirty animals, thus an indication that there was no hygienic reason for diverting the carcasses derived from very dirty cattle into a separate processing line. Serraino et al. (2012) also showed statistically significant red uction of bac terial counts on carcasses produced from clean animals compared to dirty animals (on a five -category scale according to the UK scoring system). The microbial reduc tions ranged from 0.9 -2.9 logs for 0.7 -1.5 logs for Enterobacteriaceae and 0.6 -0.8 logs for generic E. coli . In most cases the reductions increased as the cattle hide dirtiness decreased, i.e. there was a direct correlation between visual hide cleanliness category and microbial contamination of beef carcass es for all three groups of microbio logical indicators. Some earlier studies also showed a similar trend , with ACC reduced by 0.4 logs in clean animals (category 2 on a five category scale according to the Irish scoring system ) compared to dirty animals (categories 3 and 5) (McEvoy et al. 2000) . Page 57 of 164 IC 1.6 Cattle hide interventions (pre -exsanguination ) In total, eight studies were identified describing research o n cattle hide interventions pre - slaughter, four investigating live animal washing, three investigating bacteriophages use in lairaged cattle and one ante - and post -mortem online cattle hide clipping. IC 1.6.1 Live animal washing and clipping Three studies conducted under commercial conditions were identified evaluating the effect of live animal hide washes (Byrne et al. 2000, Bosilevac et al. 2004a, Mies et al. 2004) . One study found that a single or double water wash and a lactic acid or 50 ppm chlorine solution wash resulted in an increase in ACC, col iforms and E. coli from 0 .1 to 0.8 log CFU/cm2, as well as an increase in Salmonella prevalence of the hide (only 50 ppm chlorine solution slightly decreased Salmonella prevalence). It was speculated that the reason for this was that washing released bacte ria encapsulated in dirt , mud and faeces on the hide, thus enabling them to more evenly contaminate the hide (Mies et al. 2004) . In another study conducted under commercial conditions (Byrne et al. 2000) , it was reported that washing of cattle for 3 min using a power hose removed all visible faecal materials on the live animals and reduced inoculated E. coli O157:H7 by 1.7 log, whereas washing for 1 min showed hardly any effect in removing the pathogen. Nevertheless , after washing for 3 min, E. coli O157:H7 was not detected on three of the four areas of the resulting carcas ses sampled , but the reduction was n ot statistically significant due to the high degree of variation . Two controlled studies investigated treatment of cattle hides with water wash and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), which , applied under pilot plant conditions , reduced ACC and Enterobacteriaceae by 1.9 -4.4 and 1.3 -3.8 logs (depending on the water pressure u sed) (Bosilevac et al. 2004c) . This treatment, when appli ed under commercial conditions in an abattoir, yielded promising reductions in hide -to-carcass transfer of both groups of indicator bacteria and also reduced prevalence of nat urally present E. coli O157 (Bosilevac et al. 2004a) . All three st udies using chemicals (CPC, lactic acid and chlorine) on live animal hides conclu ded that the treatments were more appropriate for application post- exsanguination due to animal welfare concerns. Only one study was identified which was conducted under comm ercial abattoir conditions and investigated ante - and post -mortem online cattle hide clipping (McCleery et al. 2008) . The results are grouped with two other identified studies on hide clipping post- exsanguination in the section IC 2.3.1 . Page 58 of 164 Table IC 1.6.1.

The results obtained from these experiments were variable, with one controlled trial demonstrating that the treatment with bacteriophages before processing did not produce a statistically significant reduction in E. coli O157:H7 numbers on cattle hides or beef carcasses during processing (Arthur et al. 2017) , whereas two challenge trials under lab conditions reported up to 2 log reductions in inoculated E. coli O157:H7 on cattle hide sections after 1 h exposure (Coffey et al. 2011, Tolen et al. 2018) .

The hide interventions described in the prev ious section (apart from the phage treatme nt) are more appropriate for use after animal stunning and bleeding due to multiple factors (animal welfare, technical requireme nts, risk for workers, etc). For the majority of physical and chemical interventions for cattle hides post -exsanguination used, no validation under full commercial conditions was provided. Hence, even when some of these interventions showed promising efficacy in reducing microbiota on hides, it is la rgely expected that the effect in reduc ing carcass meat surface contamination would be much smaller. Only five controlled trials conducted under commercial conditions reported hide intervention effect s on resulting beef carcass surfaces (one intervention using hide wash with sodium hydroxide , two microbial immobilisation treatments with ethanol and aqueous shellac solutions , one on chemical dehairing and two on hide clipping ). IC 2.1.1 Hide washing and clipping Hide washing with ambient or warm water under pilot and commercial conditions was found to reduce indicator bacteria of up to 1 log -cycles. Also, the prevalence of V TEC and Salmonella in studies conducted under pilot and commercial conditions was statistically significantly reduced. The increased efficacy of water washing was achieved whe n additional vacuuming or manual curry comb was used , often by 1 log -cycle . On the other hand, four studies that investigated hide clipping found very moderate reductions in transfer of ACC to beef carcass es of up to 0.3 logs of indicator bacteria. It was noted in several studies that hide clipping could be useful as a GHP pre -treatment to subsequent hazard -based hide interventions. IC 2.1.2 Hide washing with organic acids A limited number of studies describing investigations on organic acids as hide treatments reported highly variable results . One study under commercial conditions found that localised application of lactic and acetic acid s yielded reductions of 2.3 -2.6 and 3.7 logs of general and faecal microbiota. IC 2.1.3 H ide washing with other chemicals /oxidisers More studies have investigated a range of different chemicals , including oxidisers. Under pilot plant conditions, oxidisers reduced ACC and faecal microbiota by 2.0 -3.5 and 2.0- 4.0 log cycles on treated hides. Under commercial conditions, an automated hide wash with sodium hydroxide achieved statistically significant reduction in transfer to carcasses of both Page 64 of 164 aerobic and enteric bacteria of 0.8 logs and prevalence of E. coli O157 from 17% to 2%. Vacuuming following hide washing with chemicals app ears to increase efficacy in removing bacteria by 1 -2 log -cycles . IC 2.1.4 Chemical dehairing and thermal interventions Harsh treatments involving chemical dehairing and heat treatments of hide appear to be the most efficacious treatments, however with questionable practical use . Chemical dehairing was the most successful treatment under commercial conditions , achieving reduction in transfer to carcasses of aerobic and enteric bacteria of 2 logs and 1.8 logs and pr evalence of E. coli O157 from 50% to 1%. Hot water washes of hides and steam treatments achieved reductions on treated hides of up to 6 log -cycles. IC 2.1 .5 Microbial immobilisation treatments This novel approach, with the purpose to coat cattle hides , thus preventing microbial transfer onto mea t, was investigated in three studies using natural resin shellac in e thanol or aqueous solution. R eductions of up to 3.6 logs and 1.7 logs in transfer to meat of general microbiota under lab and under commercial co nditions , respectively, were reported when shellac in ethanol was used . Comparable reductions in transfer of microbiota to meat were also observed when using aqueous shellac solutions , with reductions of up to 3 logs and 2.4 logs of aerobic and enteric bac teria, respectively, under lab conditions and to resulting beef carcasses of up to 1.1 logs and 0.7 logs of ACC and EBC , respectively, under commercial conditions. Page 65 of 164 IC 2.2 Intervention description Hide water wash : refers to an ambient or cold- temperature wash to physically remove contamination from hides. Warm water wash es (usually <60oC) have a similar effect in removing bacteria (depending on the pressure used) , and when applied for a short time don't have a micro bicidal effect. Hide clipping : refers to clipping or shaving hair from the hide surface to physically remove contamination from hides. Organic acid washes : refers to washes with antimicrobials such as lactic, acetic and citric acids that affect microbial growth through disruptions to nutrient transport and energy generation an d can ca use injury to microbial cells through their low pH. Washes containing other chemicals and oxidizers : includes washes containing other miscellaneous prod ucts that destroy bacteria through various actions, such as oxidation and disruption of cellular f unctio ns, or that preven t bacterial attachment to meat. Examples include : i) Oxidisers (electrolyzed oxidized (EO) sulfate, iii) Quaternary compounds (QAC) (different proprietary sanitisers); Other chemicals ( chlorine solutions, cetylpyridinium c chloroform and carvacrol). Thermal treatments : refers to various heat treatment washes to destroy microbial cells. Examples include scalding bob -veal hide -on carcasses (usually > 60oC), hot water (usually >74oC), treatments with steam (usually > 82oC) and naked flame/ singeing (>300oC). Chemical dehairing : process of applying successive water and chemical washes (sodium sulphide followed by a neutralizing solution of hydrogen peroxide) in a cabinet to remove hair and imp rove visible cleanliness and reduce microbial loads on animal hides . Microbial immobilisation treatments : refers to a spray treatment of cattle hides with natural resin shellac, to form a protective coating as a barrier to microorganisms and the reduction in their transfer to beef carcasses. Page 66 of 164 IC 2.3 Hide washing and clipping Hide washing post -exsanguination with potable, ambient or cold water was investigated in several studies, either as a main intervention (Small et al. 2005, Arthur et al. 2007, Arthur et al. 2008a, Bosilevac et al. 2009, Wang et al. 2014) or a control treatment for chemical washes (Bosilevac et al. 2005a, Bosilevac et al. 2005b, Baird et al. 2006, Carlson et al. 2008a, Carlson et al. 2008b, Scanga et al. 2011) . There is conflicting evidence on the efficacy of water washes as a standalone intervention, with higher microbial reductions reported in laboratory studies using artificially inoculated microbiota which do not ref lect the real life conditions (Carlson et al. 2008b) . Baird et al. (2006) reported that bacterial reductions obtai ned on clipped hides after water wash were generally higher than on un- clipped hides , and concluded that hide clipping could be a useful pre -treatment to subsequent hide washes with chemicals . Under pilot plant conditions , up to 1 log reduction of ACC, EBC and E. coli on washed hides was achieved (Bosilevac et al. 2005a, Bosilevac et al. 2005b, Carlson et al. 2008a) , with increased efficacy if high -pressure washing and additional vacuuming (Bosilevac et al. 2005a) or manual curry comb were used (Wang et al. 2014) . Also, the V TEC and Salmo nella prevalence was statistically significantly reduced on washed hides using plant commercial washing systems (Arthur et al. 2007, Arthur et al. 2008a, Bosilevac et al. 2009) . With respect to hide clipping , Small et al. (2005) observed an increase in aerobic bacterial load by 0.3 log s after hide clipping, attributed to the generation of dust and subsequent spread of bacteria during the process. In the study of McCleery et al. (2008) , carcasses deriv ed from dirty , hide -clipped cattle , showed comparable bacterial levels with those from non-clipped, but clean animals ( a reduction 0.1 -0.3 logs of ACC). In the study of Van Donkersgoed et al. (1997) , the reductions achieved were similar, with a decrease of up to 0.3 logs of aerobic bacteria and faecal indicators , so the author concluded that the clipping is of questionable practical significance . Fisher et al. (2009) achieved modest reductions of inoculated E. coli K12 on hides (0.9 log s) and carcasses (0.1 logs) following hide clipping in a pilot plant . Page 67 of 164 Table IC 2.3.1 .

Most studies on lactic and acetic acid were conducted under simulated environments in pilot plants and lab conditions (challenge trials using inoculated microbiota) . Spraying/rinsing or sponge rubbing hides with lactic and acetic acid under pilot plant conditions achieved 2 -2.5 log reductions of indicator bacteria (Baird et al. 2006, Carlson et al. 2008a) , while similar treatments under lab conditions were highly variable (from 0.5 up to 5 logs of inoculated microbiota) (Mies et al. 2004, Baird et al. 2006, Carlson et al. 2008a, Carlson et al. 2008b, Fisher et al. 2009, Elramady et al. 2013, Jadeja and Hung 2014) . It was inconclusive whether the increase in lactic acid concent ration le d to increased microbial reduction, as this was noted only in one study (Mies et al. 2004) . In one small study in a pilot plant, promising reductions of inoculated E. coli K12 were achieved on hides and resulting beef carcasses after lactic acid spray (2.4 and 1.7 logs respectively) (Fisher et al. 2009) . Only one before -and-after study under full commercial conditions investigating localised application of l actic and acetic acid found reductions of 2.3-2.6 and 3.7 logs of general and faecal naturally present microbiota, respectively, on treated hides (Scanga et al. 2011) .

Under pi lot plant conditions, they statistically significantly reduced general and faecal microbiota by 2.0 -3.5 and 2.0 -4.0 log cycles on treated hides (Bosilevac et al. 2005b, Schmidt et al. 2012) . Furthermore , various other chemicals have been used in commercial or l ab studies for hide treatments (s urfactants , sanitisers, chlorine solutions, 2003, Mies et al. 2004, Bosilevac et al. 2005a, Small et al. 2005, Baird et al. 2006, Carlson et al. 2008a, Carlson et al. 2008b, \u00c7aliciolu et al. 2010, Antic et al. 2011, Scanga et al. 2011, Baskaran et al. 2012, McDonnell et al. 2012, Baskaran et al. 2013, Wang et al. 2014, Yang et al. 2015, Long et al. Page 73 of 164 2018) . Under commercial conditions, automated hide washes with sodium hydroxide achieved statistically significant reduction in transfer to carcasses of aerobic and enteric bacteria of 0.8 logs and prevalence of E. coli O157 from 17% to 2%, as well as reduction s on treated hides of 2.1 and 3.4 logs and 44% to 16% respectively (Bosilevac et al. 2005a) . Across all chemicals used, the reductions highly depended on the study design and nature of microbiota used, as well as different treatment conditions (chemical concentration, application method and c ontact time). Additional vacuuming increased efficacy in removing bacteria by 1-2 log -cycles. Page 74 of 164 Table IC 2.5.1 .

Given the fact that the hide is damaged during the process, these harsh interven tions are more suitable for bob veal calves which usually stay with the skin -on, or i n situations where hides are not used for leather production. Some studies eva luated the efficacy of chemical dehairing for removing hairs, dirt, f aeces and microbial contamination from cattle hides (Castillo et al . 1998a, Nou et al. 2003, Carlson et al. 2008b) . Chemical dehairing comprised treatment using sodium s ulphide , hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) and /or potassium cyanate applied under laboratory conditions , which statistically significantly reduced inoculated bact eria by >4 logs (Castillo et al. 1998a, Carlson et al. 2008b) . In one controlled trial, chemical de hairing treatment statistically significantly reduced E. coli O157 prevalence and ACC and Enterobacteri aceae counts on pre- evisceration carcasses (Nou et al. 2003) . One c hallenge study investigated different single or multiple treatments for bob veal calves which stay with the hide -on throughout the dressing process. Scalding at temperatures >60oC reduce d inoculated E. coli by 2 -4 log cycles and the treatment efficacy was statistically significantly improved when usin g an additional hot water wash (82oC) and/or lactic acid (4.5%) spray with reduction ranging from 4.5 -6.3 logs on treated hides (Hasty et al. 2018) . Hot water (under 80oC) alone (Fisher et al. 2009, \u00c7aliciolu et al. 2010) or in combination with chlorine spray (Wang et al. 2014) also was shown to statistically significantly reduce aerobic and enteric bacteria by 2-3.5 logs. Two studies investigated the application of steam for t he decontamination of cattle hides (McEvoy et al. 2001, McEvoy et al. 2003) . Under laboratory conditions, steam treatment reduced aerobic bacteria by 1.9 -4.0 log s whereas the reduction effect on inoculated E. coli O157:H7 was even greater, 1.9-6.0 logs. However, hide quality was severely damaged by this thermal intervention , making it unsuitable for practical application in commercial settings. Naked flame and singeing (>3 00oC) was highly effective with reductions from 2 -5 log -cycles on treated hides (Small et al. 2005, Fisher et al. 2009) . However, the downsi de of this treatment , beside the hide damage , is generation of smoke and ash , which can present occupational hazard. Page 81 of 164 Table IC 2.6.1 .

However, better and more consistent microbial immobilising effect has been achieved using the innovative treatment of cattle hides with shellac, a natural, food -grade resin, used in ethanol or aqueous solution and sprayed on hides (Antic et al. 2010, Antic et al. 2011, Antic et al. 2018) . In a la boratory model system, spraying hides with the shellac solution in ethanol markedly reduced the levels of general microbiota (up to 6.6 log 10 CFU/cm2) and the prevalence o f E. coli O157 (up to 3.7 -fold) recoverable from hide by swabbing (Antic et al. 2010) . The reductions were primarily due to the bacterial immobilisation effect of the shellac component, whilst the bactericidal effect of the solvent (ethanol) itself played a comparably smaller role in the ove rall re duction. Laboratory experiments, involving the direct contact of treated hides with meat, achieved reductions of up to 3.6 log 10 CFU/cm2 of general microbiota (Antic et al. 2011) . Post-slaughter but pre -skinning treatment of hides with a shellac solution, examined during the operation of a commercial abattoir, statistically significantly reduced (up to 1.7 logs ) the levels of general microbiota found on beef carcasses (Anti c et al. 2011) . Therefo re, the shellac -base d hide -coating treatment was demonstrated to statistically signifi cantly reduce the risk of cross -contamination from hide to carcass, and also reduced the potential for airborne contamination of the skinned carcass from dust and dirt that detach from non- treated hides during hide removal. In a subsequent study using a range of aqueous shellac solutions, reductions in transfer to meat of up to 3 logs and 2.4 logs of aerobic and enteric bacteria under lab conditions were achieved . Validation of the treatment under commercial conditions reported reductions in transfer to resulting beef carcasses of up to 1.1 logs and 0.7 logs of ACC and EBC respectively, on different carcass sites (Antic et al. 2018) .

Page 89 of 164 IC 3: Beef carcass interventions IC 3.1 Sum mary of k ey findings IC 3.1.1 Standard processing procedures and GHP There was a lack of pu blished studies describing the efficacy of standard processing procedures and GHP in reducing beef carcass microbial contamination. Subjective assessment of improved hide removal practices in four studies indicated statistically signi ficant reduction in tr ansfer of indicator bacteria from hides to carcasses by 1 log -cycle and reduced prevalence of V TEC and Salmonella on beef carcasses. Only one study in commercial conditions didn't find benefit of impleme nting downward vs. upward hide pulling method, but so me differences were noted on specific carcass sites, often in favour of upward technique. Hence, it was concluded that the differences could be due to possibl e deficiencies in the implemen tation of the HACCP pre -requisite programmes and were not necessarily asso ciated with the skinning method per se . Bung bagging appear to have been efficacious in the three studies where reductions of indicator bacteria by around 1 log -cycle and prevalence of V TEC were reported. Overall better processi ng hygiene represented by better hygiene scores between abattoirs were associated with improved carcass microbial status in five observational studies. Alternative methods for knives sanitation were in most cases shown to be equivalent to the current sanit ation procedures in wa ter at 82\u00b0C for one second duration. Methods suitable for use on the slaughterline with contact times up to 1 minute such as dipping knives in water for longer times at lower temperatures , use of ultrasound combined with organic acids , and use of chemicals (sanitisers, peroxyacetic and organic acids) produced eq uivalent reductions of bacteria comparing to current procedures using water at 82\u00b0C for one second . IC 3.1.2 Pre -chill carcass treatments Large number of studies have been published on beef carcass interventions post dehiding but pre -chill. There were large variations in magnitude of reduction effect across studies within single intervention, because of different intervention conditions used, therefore the results on intervention efficacy are not dir ectly comparable. Water wash with ambient or cold water to remove microorganisms was largely ineffective with up to 0.5 log reduction achieved, but dependant on washing time and pressure used. Very often, washing carcasses appeared to have increased contamination and/or redistribute bacteria. On the other hand, trimming of visually contaminated sites reduced levels of natural microbiota (ACC and faecal indicators) from 1 -2 logs, whereas spot steam vacuu ming had similar effect of 1 -2 logs. Hot water washing provided consistent reduction effect from 1 -2.5 logs (seen across a number of studies) , increasing by 0.5 -1 log -cycles if organic acids were used concurrently . Page 90 of 164 The whole carcass steam pasteurisa tion effect in reducing natural microbiota was mos t often ar ound 1 -1.5 log -cycles. Organic acid carcass washes (lactic, acetic and citric) were effective on -line interventions with higher reductions reported for lactic acid (1 -2 logs of natural microbiota) than for acetic and citric acid or their mixtures (usually up to 1 log ). A large number of studies conducted under pilot and laboratory conditions investigated various physical (water washes and thermal treatments) and chemical interventions (organic acids and other chemicals) alone or in combinations . They report ed large variation of reduction effects, but very often between 2 -5 logs. This must be taken with caution and only as relative and indication of the potential intervention effect , because of artif icial nature of inoculated microorganisms, controlled study conditions and often low number of samples investigated. IC 3.1.3 Chilling Chilling for up to three days reduced levels of indicator bacteria in most cases up to only 0.5 logs under commercial conditions and up to 2 logs of inoculated E. coli and Salmonel la under pilot and lab conditions . Chilling carcasses for one day previously sprayed with organic acids o r treated with hot water or steam on the slaughterline reduced indicator bacteria from 0.6 -2.1 logs under commercial conditions and up to 3.5 logs of E . coli under pilot and lab conditions , likely due to a residual effect of chemical interventions . Dry aging of carcasses up to two weeks reported reductions of up to 2 logs of faecal indicators in first four days of dry aging. Reductions of around 1 log af ter six days or around 3 logs of inoc ulated enteric pathogens after seven days of dry aging have been als o reported with on average 0.1-0.2 log reduction per day of inoculated Salmonella during 14 -day dry aging of beef cuts . Water spray chilling showed very variable effects in reducing natural microbiota on carcasses in commercial conditions and it appears it was plant specific and influenced by various different factors . On inoculated V TEC and Salmonella reductions effects of up to 2 logs were observed, wh ich increased when various chemicals were sprayed onto beef carcass cuts during chilling producing reductions from 1 -4.5 logs comparing to water spray chilling alone . IC 3.1.4 Post -chill and pre -fabrication carcass treatments Following the completion of c hilling and prior to carcass fabrication, only a few studies reported intervention for carcasses at this stage. Lactic acid spray was shown to statistically significantly reduce aerobic bacteria up to 3 log -cycles and faecal bacteria up to 1.5 logs , with r eductions increasing to up to 7 logs of inoculated V TEC and Salmonella under laboratory conditions . Page 91 of 164 One novel non -thermal intervention, electron beam (E -beam) irradiation, was reported to be highly efficacious at a 1 kGy dose, and when applied to chilled beef primals reduced E. coli O157:H7 numbers by up to 6.6 log -cycles . IC 3.1.5 Multiple on -line interventions and HACCP Sequential application of interventions after dehiding but before chilling based on a 'multiple -hurdle appr oach' was investigated in a t otal of 16 studies under commercial abattoir conditions. The interventions usually involved some or all of the following: knife trimming, steam vacuuming, pre -evisceration washing, washing, thermal decontamination with water or steam and organic acid (or p eroxyacetic acid) rinsing before chilling. Consistent reductions of naturally present bacterial indicators were achieved across a number of studies and were higher than when only one single intervention was used . In most cases they ranged from 2 -3 logs for ACC and/or faecal indicators. Furthermore, the prevalence of naturally present V TEC and Salmonella following sequential application of interventions was in most cases statistically significantly reduced, often to levels below detection limits . In one controlled trial in a pilot plant where hide s were washed with lactic and acetic acid followed by carcass organic acid washes prior to chilling , the reduction s obtained and measured after chilling were in the range 1.5 -2 logs compared to untrea ted (only chille d) carcasses . No overall effect of HACCP implementation on pathogen (V TEC and Salmonella ) reduction was reported in eight before -and-after studies, but levels of indicator aerobic and faecal bacteria were reduced on carcasses from 0.5 -1 log -cycle after HA CCP implementation . IC 3.2 Intervention description Standard process ing procedures and good hygiene practices (GHP): includes a range of different practices that are pre-requisites to hazard- based interventions, are qualitative in nature and based on em pirical knowledge and experience and may have a pathogen - reduction effect. Tool: an implement that is used in the dressing/processing of carcasses and co ming into contac t with a carcass /meat . Cleaning and/or disinfection : Removal of dirt and organic substa nces from and sanitation of meat processing plant equipment and environment. Bung bagging (bunging) : Closing off the rectum by cutting around the anus, placing a bag over the rectum and securing it in place with an elastic band or similar during evisceration, to minimize the spread of contamination on a carcass . Trimming : Physical removal of visible contamination from carcasses with knife. Page 92 of 164 Water wash : refers to an ambient or cold -temperature wash to physically remove contamination from carcass surface . Warm water wash (usually <60oC) has similar effect in removing bacteria (depending on the pressure used) and when applied for a short time doesn't have microbicidal effect. Organic acid washes : refers to washes with antimicrobials such as lactic, acetic and citric acid that affect microbial growth through disruptions to nutrient transport and energy generation an d can cause injury to microbial cells through their low pH. Washes containing other chemicals and oxidizers : includes washes containing other miscellan eous products that destroy bacteria through various actions, such as oxidation and disruption of cellular functions, or that prevent bacterial attachment to meat. Examples include : electrolyzed oxidized (EO) water (acidic, alkaline or neutral) hydrobromous acid , trisodium phosphate ). Thermal interventions : refers to various heat treatment washes to destroy microbial cells. Non -thermal interventions : refers to non-chemical and non -thermal interventions that aim to reduce microbial contamination while preserving product quality and nutrients that can be affected by thermal treatments (electron beam irradiation and ultraviolet (UV) light). Hot water wash : refers to washing carcasses with water at temperatures >74 oC, up to 85oC. Steam vacuuming : spot application of steam and/or hot water (usually >82oC) to loosen contamination and kill bacteria, followed by a vacuuming . Steam pasteurisation: Steam (usually >82oC, up to 105oC) applied to a whole beef carcass in a closed cabinet . Method involves: i) removal of water from carcass side surfaces, which remains after p ost-evisceration washing, using air blowers or vacuum; ii) surface ''pasteuris ation'' w ith pressurize d steam (6.5 -10 s); and iii) a cold -water spray to cool down carcass surfaces before they are moved to chillers. Dry heat : refers to non -hydrating thermal interventions such a forced -air heating . Dry chilling : refers to chilling following all dressing proc edures on the slaughterline without the use of any additional spray (acid or water). Spray chilling : intermittent spraying beef carcass with water during the first several hours of the whole cooling process . Dry aging: refers to multiday refrigeration of c arcasses. Multiple interventions : refers to an application of interventions based on the 'multiple hurdle approach', where chem ical and/or physical interventions are applied in sequence or simultaneo usly, inflicting c oncurrent and variable injuries to bact erial cells. Sequential Page 93 of 164 application of interventions involves use of interventions on cattle hides, followed by knife trimming, steam vacuuming, pre -evisceration washing, washing, thermal decontamination with water or steam, organic acid rinsing, chillin g, and chemical spraying before carcass fabrication. HACCP : Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (system that identifies, evaluates, and controls hazards significant for the safety of food produced in the given proces s). IC 3.3 Standard processing proce dures and GHP Standard processing procedures and GHP were investigated in 13 studies, with another 11 studies reporting on knives sanitation interventions. In the three studies conducted under commercial conditions, the procedure of tying the rectum (bung bagging) to prevent faecal spillage reduced levels of indicator bacteria by around 1 log -cycle (Saleh et al. 2012) and statistically significantly reduced presence of enteric marker bacteria and pathogens (Hudson et al. 1998, Stopforth et al. 2006) . Improved hide removal practices appear to reduce transfer of indicator bacteria from hide to carcas ses by up to 1 log (Gill and McGinnis 1999, McEvoy et al. 2000, Bosilevac et al. 2016) and also statistically significantly reduce the transfer of enteric pathogens (Bosilevac et al. 2017) . However, there was no improvement in the microbial status of beef carcasses after hide removal when a supposedly better downward hide removal technique was used and compared to upward technique in only one controlled trial (Kennedy et al . 2014) . Five observational cross -sectional studies compared process hygiene between abattoirs (Hudson et al. 1996, Rahkio and Korkeala 1996, Alegre and Buncic 2004, Muluneh and Kibret 2015, Nastasijevic et al. 2016) . When structured UK food hygiene assessment scoring system s were used (HAS or MOC) (Hudson et al. 1996, Alegre and Buncic 2004, Nastasijevic et al. 2016) , it was observed that abattoirs assessed as 'better' in terms of hygie nic practices employed were associated , in most cases, with final beef carcasses carrying a lower microbial load , sometimes with up to 2 log difference. Knives sanitation has been research ed in a total of 11 studies (Midgley and Eustace 2003, Uradziski et al. 2005, Eustace et al. 2007, Taormina and Dorsa 2007, Goulter et al. 2008, Rajkovic et al. 2010, Heres and Verkaar 2011, Leps et al. 2013, Tapp Iii et al. 2013, Musavian et al. 2015, Brasil et al. 2017) . Dipping knives in water for shorter times at higher temperatures or longer times at lower temperatures produc ed equivalent reductions of bacteria compared to current procedures in water at 82\u00b0C for one second (Midgley and Eustace 2003, Eustace et al. 2007, Goulter et al. 2008, Leps et al. 2013) . The benefits of using alterna tive system are: i) saving on energy consumption required to heat the water; ii) saving on the water consumption in a through -flow syst em; iii) reduced incidents of scalding of personnel; iv) reduced condensation and fogging in the slaughter hall; and v) r educed maintenance costs in the long term (Midgley and Eustace 2003, Eustace et al. 2007) . Page 94 of 164 Other procedures investigated as alternative to the current hot water knife sanitation included various chemicals such as detergents (Brasil et al. 2017) , organic acids (Heres and Verkaar Leps , p eroxyacetic acid (Taormina and Dorsa 2007, Tapp Iii et al. 2013) , prolonged exposure to ozone (Uradziski et al. 2005) , ultrasound with or without steam or detergent (Leps et al. 2013, Musavian et al. 2015, Brasil et al. 2017) and UV light (Rajkovic et al. 2010) . With respect to procedures that don't require prolonged contact time with knives and hence are suitable for use on the slaughterline (contact time of up to 1 minute with knives rotation) , use of warm water for longer times in combination with organic acids and/or ultrasound, appears to be comparably effective as the current hot water knife sanitation at 82\u00b0C (Heres and Verkaar 2011, Leps et al. 2013) . Other sanitation procedures that require prolonged contact time with knives (ultras ound in combination with detergents, UV light and ozone) are more suitable for knives sanitation during breaks or after the work has been finished (Uradziski et al. 2005, Rajkovic et al. 2010, Brasil et al. 2017) .

Typhimurium 0.6-3.4 Page 98 of 164 IC 3.4 Pre -chill carcass treatments Beef carcass interventions post- dehiding and pre -chill have been investigated in 90 studies. , A range of different conditions have been reported among different physical and chemical interventions (temperatures, contact time, pressure, mode of application (wash, spray, rinse, dip, deluge, manual or automated) , number of samples and sample method used), and there were large variations in magnitude of effect across studies . Therefore, the results on intervention efficacy are not directly comparable. Overall, 35 controlled and before -and-after trial studies conducted under commercial conditions have been reported (Gill et al. 1996a, Gill et al. 1996b, Bell 1997, Gill and Bryant 1997b, Kochevar et al. 1997, Nutsch et al. 1997, Nutsch et al. 1998, Gill et al. 1999, Hajmeer et al. 1999, Dormedy et al. 2000, Gill and Bryant 2000, De Martinez et al. 2002, Gill and Landers 2003b, Minihan et al. 2003b, Gill and Landers 2004, McEvoy et al. 2004, Corantin et al. 2005, Retzlaff et al. 2005, Bosilevac et al. 2006, Algino et al. 2007, Rodriguez 2007, Ruby et al. 2007, Trivedi et al. 2007, Ramish 2011, Trairatapiwan et al. 2011, Wright 2011, Thomas et al. 2012, Carranza et al. 2013, Chaves et al. 2013, Narv\u00e1ez -Bravo et al. 2013, Wang et al. 2013, Dong et al. 2014, Dong et al. 2015, Hochreutener et al. 2017, Signorini et al. 2018) . Hot water wash and lactic acid, as a standalone interv ention or in combination, were by far the most ofte n investigated interventions under commercial conditions. Water wash with ambient or cold water to remove microorganisms was largely ineffective , with up to 0.5 log reduction achieved, and dependant on washing time and pressure used. Higher reductions were reported only in the study by Gill et al. (1996b) on more contaminated sites. However, in c ombination with organic acids, the reduction effect appears to increase by 1 log -cycle (Gill and Landers 2003b, Carranz a et al. 2013) . Trimming of visually contaminated sites reduced levels of natural microbiota by 1-2 logs (Gill et al. 1996a, Kochevar et al. 1997, Gill and Landers 2004) . Furthermore , two challenge trials conducted under commercial conditions reported using permitted artificial microbiota to inoculate carcas ses and investigate the effect s of trimming, water and hot water wash, as well as chemicals (hydrogen peroxide and ozone) (Reagan et al. 1996, Graves Delmore et al. 1997) . Trimming in combination with water and/or hot water rinsi ng removed inoculated coliform bacteria by 1.3-1.8 logs. Hot water washing provided consistent reduction effect by 1-2.5 logs, increasing by 0.5 -1 log-cycles if organic acids were used concurrently (Bosilevac et al. 2006, Algino et al. 2007, Wright 2011, Signorini et al. 2018) . The temperatures of carcass surfaces pasteurised with hot water usually achieve d more than 70oC. The time -temperature combinations required to achieve statistically significan t reductions were usually specific to an individual commerc ial abattoir. Furthermore, b oth spot steam vacuuming and whole carcass steam pasteurisation reduced natural microbiota by around 1 -1.5 log -cycles (Kochevar et al. 1997, Nutsch et al. 1997, Nutsch et al. 1998, Minihan et al. 2003b, Corantin et al. 2005, Retzlaff et al. 2005, Trivedi et al. 2007, Hochreutener et al. 2017) . Page 99 of 164 Organic acid carcass washes, alone (lactic, acetic and citric) or as a mixture , were ef fective on-line interventions with higher reductions reported for lactic acid (1 -2 logs of natural microbiota) (Dormedy et al. 2000, De Martinez et al. 2002, Bosilevac et al. 2006, Rodriguez 2007, Ruby et al. 2007, Wright 2011, Signorini et al. 2018) than other acid s (usually up to 1 log) (Algino et al. 2007, Carranza et al. 2013, Signorini et al. 2018) . Mixtures of organic acids did not provide any added beneficial effect a nd reductions achieved were around 1 log - cycles (Algino et al. 2007, Signorini et al. 2018) . If more than one wash was applied at a single step, often combining a thermal effect with an organic acid, this produced additional reduction effects of 1 log -cycles (Gill and Landers 2003b, Bosilevac et al. 2006, Ruby et al. 2007, Wright 2011, Carranza et al. 2013, Wang et al. 2013) . Challenge trials under pilot plant conditions hav e been reported in 14 articles (Castillo et al. 1998c, Castillo et al. 1998b, Castillo et al. 1999a, Castillo et al. 1999b, Castillo et al. 2001b, Castillo et al. 2003, Marshall et al. 2005, Kalchayanand et al. 2008, Niebuhr et al. 2008, Cabrera- Diaz et al. 2009, Kalchayanand et al. 2009, Davidson 2010, Sevart et al. 2016, Krug 2017) . The conditions in pilot plant s are considered to mimic those in commercial abattoirs, and in most cases , researchers used whole carcasses or large beef primals to investigate intervention efficacy in commercial washing/spraying cabinets . Various physical (water washes and thermal treatment s) and chemical interventions (organic acids and other chemicals) alone or in combinations, have be en shown to produce large variation of reduction effects, very often between 2 -5 logs . However, this must be viewed with caution and only as relative and ind icative of the potential intervention effect. Most often, intervention studies were conducted unde r laboratory conditions using artificially inoculated microbiota (challenge trials). A total of 39 lab trials (most often challenge trials) were identified t hat investigated one or several interventions on pre -rigor carcass meat to generate data on their relative efficacy and their suitability for commercial on-line application (Cabedo et al. 1996, Dorsa et al. 1996a, Dorsa et al. 1996b, Bell et al. 1997, Cutter et al. 1997a, Cutter et al. 1997b, Dorsa et al. 1997a, Dorsa et al. 1997b, Gorman et al. 1997, Phebus et al. 1997, Tinney et al. 1997, Delazari et al. 1998a, Delazari et al. 1998b, Dorsa et 1998, Graves Delmore et al. 1998, Cutter 1999a, Cutter et al. 2000, Cutter and Rivera -Betancourt 2000, Hajmeer et al. 2004, Retzlaff et al. 2004, McCann et al. 2006b, Penney et al. 2007, Arthur et al. 2008b, Pearce and Bolton 2008, Sawyer et al. 2008, Ingham et al. 2010, Yoder et al. 2010, Carpenter et al. 2011, Njongmeta et al. 2011, Kalchayanand et al. 2012, McDonnell et al. 2012, Yoder et al. 2012, Youssef et al. 2012, Kalchayanand et al. 2015, Scott et al. 2015, Rodr\u00edguez -Melc\u00f3n et al. 2017, Scott -Bullard Yang et al. 2017a) . The reductions repor ted should be viewed with caution and only as relative and indicative of the po tential intervention effect because these trials often used a small number of samples challenged with a high number of pathogens, which exaggerate s the efficacy of interventions .

Dry chilling effects on carcass microbial load have been investigated in 1 7 studies under commercial conditions , on its own or following previous multi sequential intervention s on the slaughterline (Hajmeer et al. 1999, Sofos et al. 1999, Bacon et al. 2000, McEvoy et al. 2004, Fegan et al. 2005a, Fegan et al. 2005b, Carney et al. 2006, Kinsella et al. 2006, Trivedi et al. 2007, Trairatapiwan et al. 2011, Dong et al. 2014, Dong et al. 2015, Hauge et al. 2015, Sampaio et al. 2015, Fontcuberta et al. 2016, Liu et al. 2016, Yang et al. 2017b) . In addition, nine challenge trials in pilot or lab conditions were reported on dry chilling (Calicioglu et al. 1999, Calicioglu et al. 2002, Crowley et al. 2009, Kinsella et al. 2009, Ingham et al. 2010, Tittor et al. 2011, Hudson et al. 2013, Sevart et al. 2016, Reid et al. 2017) Chilling for up to three days only reduced the levels of indicator bacteria in most cases by only 0.5 logs under commercial conditions (Hajmeer et al. 1999, McEvoy et al. 2004, Kinsella et al. 2006, Trivedi et al. 2007, Hauge et al. 2015, Sampaio et al. 2015) , but some auth ors reported reductions of 1-2 logs under similar conditions ( Liu et al. 2016, Yang et al. 2017b) . Under pilot and lab conditions, reductions of inoculated E. col i and Salmonella were up to 2 logs (Calicioglu et al. 1999, Calicioglu et al. 2002, Crowley et al. 2009, Kinsella et al. 2009, Tittor et al. 2011, Sevart et al. 2016, Reid et al. 2017) . Chilling carcasses previously sprayed with organic acids or treated with hot water or steam on the slaughterline for one day reduced indicator bacteria from 0.6 -2.1 logs under commerc ial conditions (Bacon et al. 2000) and up to 3.5 logs of E. coli under pilot and lab conditions (Calicioglu et al. 2002, Ingham et al. 2010) , likely due to a residual effect of the chemical interventions . Effects of cold t emperatures after completed chilling , durin g dry aging of carcasses for up to two weeks , have been reported in four studies, one before -and-after trial under commercial conditions (Algino et al. 2007) , one challenge trial in pilot conditions (Calicioglu et al. 2002) and two in lab conditions (Ingham et al. 2010, Knudsen et al. 2011) . Algino et al. (2007) reported reductions of up to 2 logs of faecal indicators in the first four days of dry aging. Reductions of around 1 log after six days or around 3 logs of inoc ulated enteric pathogens after seven days of dry aging have also been reported (Calicioglu et al. 2002, Ingham et al. 2010) . Knudsen et al. (2011) reported 0.1 -0.2 log s reduction per day of inoculated Salmonella during a 14-day dry aging of beef cuts. Spray chilling with water was investigated in six st udies under commercial conditions (Gill and Bryant 1997b, Gill and Bryant 1997a, Jericho et al. 1998, Gill and Landers 2003a, Corantin et al. 2005, Kinsella et al. 2006) ; two challenge trials under pilot and lab conditions reported on water spray chilling (Titt or et al. 2011) and spray chilling with chemical solutions (Stopforth et al. 2004) . In general, water spray chilling showed very variable effects in reducing natural microbiota on carcasses in commercial conditions and it appears these were plant specific and influenced by other factors . On inoculated V TEC and Page 106 of 164 Salm onella, water spray chilling achieved up to 2 logs reduction (Stopforth et al. 2004, Tittor et al. 2011). Spraying various chemicals onto beef carcass cuts during chilling (sodium hypochlorite, a cidified sodium chlorite c hloride ) increased effectiveness by 0.7 logs, 2.2 logs, 2.5 logs, 3.2 logs and 4.7 logs, respectively for all chemicals, comparing to water spray chilling alone (Stopforth et al. 2004) .

Lactic acid spray was shown to statistically significantly reduce aerobic bacteria by up to 3 log -cycles and faecal bacteria by up to 1.5 logs (Castillo et al. 2001a, Ruby et al. 2007) . Highly variable reductions with lactic acid were achieved in lab conditions on inoculated V TEC and Salmonella , varying from 1 -7 logs (Castillo et al. 2001b, King et al. 2005, Sevart et al. 2016, Acuff 2017, Krug 2017) . Reductions of around 1 log -cycle were achieved when peroxyacetic acid was sprayed onto beef (King et al. Acuff 2017, Krug 2017) . One novel non -thermal intervention, electron beam (E -beam) irradiation, was reported to be highly efficacious at a 1 kGy dose, and when applied to chilled beef primals , reduced E. coli O157:H7 numbers by at least 4 logs and up to 6.6 log -cycles (Arthur et al. 2005) .

Sequential application of interventions after dehiding usually involved some or all of the following: knife trimming, steam vacuuming, pre -evisceration washing, washing, thermal deco ntamination with water or steam and organic acid (or peroxyacetic acid) rinsing before chillin g. Consistent reductions were achieved , which were higher than when only one single intervention was used, and in most cases reductions ranged from 2 to 3 logs of aerobic or faecal indicat ors (Bacon et al. 2000, Arthur et al. 2004, Ruby et al. 2007, Bosilevac et al. 2016) . In one controlled trial in a pilot plant where hide organic acid wash es were investigat ed concurrently with carcass washes, the reduction obtained after chilling was in the range of 1.5 -2 logs compared to untreated (only chilled) carcasses (Van Ba et al. 2018) . Furthermore, the p revalence of naturally present V TEC and Salmonella following sequential application of interventions was in most cas es statistically significantly reduced, often to levels below detection limits (Elder et al. 2000, Arthur et al. 2002, B acon et al. 2002a, Barkocy -Gallagher et al. 2003, Arthur et al. 2004, Rivera- Betancourt et al. 2004, Ruby et al. 2007, Brichta -Harhay et al. 2008, Brichta- Harhay et al. 2011, Koohmaraie et al. 2012) . The effect of HACCP implementation on overall improveme nt of microbial status of beef carcasses was investigated in eight before -and-after studies (Phillips et al. 2001, Rose et al. 2002, Sumner et al. 2003, Sumner et al. 2004, Ghafir et al. 2005, Phillips et al. 2006, Tergney and Bolton 2006, Nastasijevic et al. 2009) . It appears that there is no overal l effect of HACCP on pathogen (V TEC and Salmonella ) reduction, but the levels of indicator aerobic and faecal bacteria were reduced on carcasses by 0.5-1 log -cycle s after HACCP implementation.

Page 127 of 164 Page 128 of 164 Irradiation appears to be one of the most effective interventions and is able to deliver the complete elimination of inoculated pathogens, with reduction effects >6 logs, whereas h igh- pressure processing produced highly variable reductions dependi ng on the study conditions , rang ing from 3 -5 logs. IC 4.2 Intervention description Packaging- based interventions : interventions that can be applied to prevent spoilage and inhibit microbial growth during final product distribution and storage . Modified atmosphere and vacuum packaging : refers to the packaging where natural composition of ai r is altered and replaced by an alternative atmosphere , most often by active displ acement of gases in the package and their replacement by a desired mixture of gases (usually a different mixture of o xygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide , comprising 60- 75% CO 2, 10-25% oxygen and 15- 30% nitrogen ). Vacuum packaging has the air completely removed. Non -thermal interventions : refers to non-chemical (physical) and non -thermal interventions that aim to reduce microbial contamination while preserving product quality and nutrients that can be affected by thermal treatments (electron beam and gamma irradiation, ultraviolet (UV) light, c old atmospheric plasma and high -pressure processi ng). Biological treatments (biopreservation) : refers to the use of natural or controlled microbiota or antimicrobials as a way of preserving food and extending its shelf life . Some compounds inclu de bacteriocins and bacteria (LAB), lactoferricin and lysozyme. Page 129 of 164 IC 4.3 Stan dard processing procedures and GHP Two studies that investigated carcass fabrication hygiene found that operations involved in carcass fab rication usually le d to an increase in carcass microbial contamination with aerobic bacteria, and also increased cross-contamination from operators/environment that led to an increase in faecal indicators in the resulting beef trimmings (Gill and Jones 1999, Gill and McGinnis 2000) . One challenge trial in pilot plant conditions found that knife trimming of adipose and potentially contaminated sites after inoculation of E. coli was partially effective for up to 3 logs (Laster et al. 2012) . However, trimmin g also le d to cross - contamination o f sites that were previously not inoculated. After HACCP implementation , meat cutting plants were shown to have a reduced microbial load on food contact surfaces and the processing environment by 1 -2 logs of aerobic bacteria compared to levels before HACC P implementation (Tomasevic et al. 2016) . Two before -and-after studies that investigated cleaning and sanitation procedures in beef cutting plants found statistically significant reductions of aerobic and faecal in dicators by 0.5-3 logs on food contact surfaces after the application of different combinations of detergents and sanitisers (Yang et al. 2017c, Wang et al. 2018) . IC 4.4 Interventions for beef primals, subprimal s and trim A total of 51 laboratory and pilot plant trials were identified that inv estigated the efficacy of post -carcass fabrication interventions on beef primals , subprimals and trimmings . Compared with no treatment or water wash, most interventions ten ded to reduce natural or inoculated microbiota. Three challenge studies investigated the physical removal of inoculated bacteria by trimming and washing with water at ambient temperature (Kang et al. 2001a, Lemmons et al. 2011, Liao et al. 2015) . Trimming removed inoculated E. coli O157:H7 by 2.4 logs and washing only by 2 logs. Thermal treatments (hot water, steam, hot air) were investigated in nine studies (Gill and Badon i 1997, Ellebracht et al. 1999, Delmore Jr et al. 2000, Gill et al. 2001, Stivarius et al. 2002c, Logue et al. 2005, Purnell et al. 2005, McCann et al. 2006a, \u00d6zdemir et al. 2006, Schmidt et al. 2014) . A hot water wash and steam had statistically signific ant reduction effect s of up to 2 logs on inoculated E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella (Ellebracht et al. 1999, Logue et al. 2005, Schmid t et al. 2014) , whereas reductions of 0.5 -1 log s were reported on natural aerobic and faecal microbiota (Gill and Badoni 1997, Delmore Jr et al. 2000, Gill et al. 2001, Purnell et al. 2005) . Dry heat using a hot air gun achieved comparably higher reductions on beef trim of 1 -2 logs at lower tem peratures (60oC and 75oC) and 4 -6 logs at higher temperatures (90oC and 100oC) of inoculated V TEC and Salmonella (McCann et al. 2006a) . Obviously, these thermal treatments can have unwanted detrimental effect on Page 130 of 164 product quality, therefore intervention parameters should be balanced to meet both safety and quality needs. Organic acid washes were by far most investigated intervention in the post -fabrication stage with 29 studies reporting on their efficacy (Podolak et al. 1996, Prasai et al. 1997, Delmore Jr et al. 2000, Kang et al. 2001a, Pohlman et al. 2002b, Pohlman et al. al. 2002a, St ivarius et al. 2002c, Ransom et al. 2003, Ellebracht et al. 2005, Harris et al. 2006, \u00d6zdemir et al. 2006, Laury et al. 2009, Fouladkhah et al. 2012, Geornaras et al. 2012a, Geornaras et al. 2012b, Harris et al. 2012, Pittman et al. 2012, Wolf et al. 2012, Pohlman et al. 2014, Schmidt et al. 2014, Tango et al. 2014, Zhao et al. 2014, Liao et al. 2015, DeGeer et al. 2016, Mohan and Pohlman 2016, Dan et al. 2017, Kassem et al. 2017, Yeh et al. 2018) . Lactic acid, alone or in a combination with other chemicals or hot water, was shown to have an efficacy of around 1 -2 logs for inoculated pathogens or na tural acid) exhibited similar reductions but there were large variations in the magnit ude of effect across studies. Washes containi ng other chemicals and oxidizers were reported in 27 studies (Delmore Jr et al. 2000, Pohlman et al. 2002b, Pohlman et al. al. 2002b, Stivarius et al. 2002a, Ransom et al. 2003, Bosilevac et al . 2004b, Lim and Mustapha 2004, Harris et al. 2006, Pohlman et al. 2009, Quilo et al. 2010, Coll C\u00e1rdenas et al. 2011, Geornaras et al. 2012a, Geornaras et al. 2012b, Harris et al. 2012, Mohan et al. 2012, Dias - Morse et al. 2014, Pohlman et al. 2014, Schmi dt et al. 2014, Tango et al. 2014, Liao et al. 2015, Mehall et al. 2015, DeGeer et al. 2016, Kassem et al. 2017, Stella et al. 2017, Yeh et al. 2018) . Various chemicals were investigated: acidified sodium chlorate, ozone, s do decyl sulfate . They had very va riable effects depending on study conditions , but consistent statistically significant bacterial reductions in most studies . Phages and Lactoferricin B were investigated in four studies (Venkitanarayanan et al. 1999, Ransom et al. 2003, Tomat et al. 2013, Yeh et al. 2017) . It was reported that the efficacy of phages against inoculated E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella was in the range of 1 -2 logs. On the other hand, lactoferrricin B achie ved reductions of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 of 0.7- 0.8 logs. Multiple interventions were investigated in a controlled trial study by Kang et al. (2001b) . Multiple treatments (hot water spray , hot air, lactic acid spray) followed by vacuum storage gave better reductions of natural aerobic and faecal microbiota which ranged from 1.6 -3.7 logs.

The effect of cold aerobic storage on the survival of bacteria has been reported in five studies (Jericho et al. 2000, Barkocy -Gallagher et al. 2002, Ashton et al. 2006, Mann and Brashears 2006, Crowley et al. 2010) . Up to seven days of cold aerobic storage was shown to reduce inoculated E. coli O157:H7 by 1.5 logs (B arkocy -Gallagher et al. 2002, Ashton et al. 2006) and natural aerobic microbiota by up to 0.5 logs (Jericho et al. 2000, Crowley et al. 2010) , which then recovered and sharply increase d in numbers leading to spoilage. In another study, cold storage appeared not to hav e had any effect on inoculated E. coli O157:H7 over a 3 day cold storage of minced beef (Mann and Brashears 2006) . Modified atmosphere (MAP) and vacuum packagin g interventions were reported in seven studies, alone or in combination wi th various preservatives (Cutter 1999b, Tsigarida et al. 2000, Meurehg 2006, Crowley et al. 2010, Kudra et al. 2011, Miya et al. 2014, Salim et al. 2018) . MAP and vacuum packaging had limited and not statistically significant reduction effect s on inoculated E. coli O157:H7 of up to 0.4 logs (Kudra et al. 2011) , but in combination with lactic acid , achieved 2 logs reduction (Salim et al. 2018) . Both MAP and vacuum packaging had statistically significant reduction effects on L. monocytogenes of 1.5 - 3.5 and 1.0- 2.7 logs, respectively (Tsigarida et al. 2000) . Four challenge trial studies investigated the use of lactic acid bacteria ( Lactobacillus spp.) to control pathogens in the final product (Muthukumarasamy et al. 2003, Hoyle et al . 2009, Ruby and Ingham 2009, Kirsch et al. 2017) and reported variable reductions of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 of up to 3 logs in minced beef. Other biol ogical interventions include the use of phages , nisin and lactoferricin and were reported in four challenge trial studies (Zhang and Mustapha 1999, Solomakos et al. 2008, Cui et al. 2017, Stratakos and Grant 2018) . Nisin was mostly found to be effective against E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes (1-2 logs) as w ell as phages , with up to 1 log reduction of E. coli O157:H7. Other preservation treatments , such as using various salts, organic acids and other chemical preservatives with or without active packaging films , were investigated in seven studies (Cutter 2000, Ahn et al. 2004, Chao and Yin 2009, Ryu and Fung 2010, Marcous et al. 2017, Stratakos and Grant 2018, Visvalingam and Holley 2018) , with very variable effects depending on the intervention conditions. Other non- thermal interventions investigated included electron beam and gamma irradiation (Chung et al. 2000, Ouattara et al. 2002, Turgis et al. 2008, Prendergast et al. 2009, Ramamoorthi et al. 2009, Kundu et al. 2014, Li et al. 2015) , ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation (Kim et al. 2014) , cold atmospheric plasma (Bau er et al. 2017, Stratakos and Page 134 of 164 Grant 2018) and high -pressure proces sing (Patel and Solomon 2005, Morales et al. 2008, Black et al. 2010, Patel et al. 2012, Bulut 2014, Hsu et al. 2015, Jiang et al. 2015, Zhou et al. 2016, Chien et al. 2017) . Irradiation appears to be one of the mo st effective interventions and is able to deliver complete elimination of inoculated pathogens, with reduction effects >6 logs, whereas UV light was less effective on V TEC, Salmonella and L. monocytogenes (reductions of up to 1.5 logs after a prolonged period of exposure). High -pressure processing produced highly variable reductions depending on the study conditions, but these reductions were often very high, ranging from 3 -5 logs.

The steps are generic and the order may be varied in specific establishment s. Intervention measures may be applied at one or multiple s teps within the process flow. The review cover s interventions at the abattoir level (from receive and unload of animals to chilled carcasses) and post -abattoir level (further processing- storage -distribution of raw beef and packaging). Potential interventi on measures for application at single or multiple points can be GHP - or hazard -based . GHP -based measures are pre -requisites to hazard -based measures and are qualitative in nature and based on empirical knowledge and experience. Some examples of GHP -based control measures applied throughout slaughter and dressing process are: cleaning and disinfection of lairage -to-stunning areas, hide cleanliness assessment, bunging, rodding, hide removal methods, trimming, chilling, equipment and tools sanitation. On the other hand, hazard -based intervention measures are developed from scientific research to specifically control certain hazards and are able to provide demonstrable and quantifiable reduction in bacterial load . Some examples of h azard -based intervention measures are: i) at abattoir level for cattle hides pre- or post - exsanguination (ambi ent water washes , hide clipping , hide chemical decontamination and microbial immobilisation treatment of cattle hides with shellac) and carcass meat after dehiding but pre -chill (thermal washes such as hot water washes, steam vacuuming and steam pasteurisa tion; organic acid washes and other chemical solutions and oxidizers) , during chilling (spray chilling with water or chemicals) and post -chill (carcass washes with chemicals) ; and ii) at post -abattoir level for fabricated beef (large joints, small meat cu ts, trimmings and minced meat): thermal (hot water) and chemical washes (organic acids and other chemicals), electron beam and gamma irradiation, ultraviolet (UV) light, us e of bacteriophages, c old atmospheric plasma and high -pressure processing, modified packaging and preservation techniques (including active and bioactive packaging systems ).

With the modern approach to meat inspection (to be risk based a nd orientated towards a whole meat chain), the animals should undergo categorisation into batches based on the risk they pose to public health. As a part of ante -mortem inspection, this is base d on the analysis of Food Chain Information, hide cleanliness s coring and ante -mortem inspection per se. The batches assessed as posing a higher risk are expected to undergo additional interventions to reduce the risks and/or process ed last . GHP -based control measures Cleaning and disinfectio n of lairage -to-stunning areas; Hide cleanliness assessment and separation of excessively dirty animals . Step 2: Cattle held in lairage The point where the animals are held in lairage, shorter or longer, before slaughter. There is an increasing opportunity for cross -contamination between animals and animals and surfaces, particularly due to prolonged lairage time and/or increased stress. In this point , application of some pre -exsanguination, non -aggressive hide t reatments of live cattle is possible. GHP -based control measures Cleaning and disinfectio n of lairage -to-stunning areas; Lairage time kept to a minimum. Hazard -based intervention measures Hide washing with ambient water; Hide clipping; Bact eriophage treatment applied to clean cattle . Step 3: Stunning and Shackling The po int where animals are rendered unconscious. There is an incre ased possibility for hide cross -contamination due to cattle contact with contaminated floor in the stunning box and landing area. GHP -based control measures Frequent cleaning of stunning box and area ; Page 160 of 164 Hygienic shackling to avoid contact between stick wounds (if sticking is performed in lying position) and contaminated areas . Hazard -based intervention measures Some of the post - exsanguination hide treatments can/should be applied before sticking to avoid stick wound contamination. Step 4 : Sticking/Bleeding The point where the animal is bled. There is a range of possible control measures for cattle hides at this point including post - exsanguination hide treatme nts. Some of these treatments have been investigated and trialled commercially but due to practical difficulties have not been used since. GHP -based control measures Cleaning/scrap ing the hide surface area to remove dirt (if previous whole hide clipping i s not performed) prior to sticking; Hygienic cut using two -knife system; Knife and tools cleaning and sanitation. Hazard -based intervention measures Hide washing with ambient water ; Hide clipping; Thermal interventions ; Chemical d ehairing ; Organic acid washes ; Oxidiser chemical washes ; Other chemical washes ; Microbial immobilisation treatment of cattle hides with ethanol or aqueous shellac . Step 5: Dehiding The point where the cattle hide is removed. Hide is the most significant source of microbial contam ination for beef carcass and therefore there is a range of p otential GHP - and hazard - based measures available for application at and after this step. GHP -based control measures Using two -knife system with frequent changing knives; Knives, e quipment and to ols sanitation; Page 161 of 164 Hide removal methods - mechanical hide pullers used in such way to pull hide away from the carcass (i.e. downward and backward motion). Hazard -based interventio n measures A range of possible hazard -based pre-evisceration interventions for beef carcasses are available at this stage (particularly knife trimming, steam vacuuming, hot water and organic acid washes) , but they may be also applied at other suita ble stages (see step 13) . Step 6 : Rodding/Tying the oesophagus The oesophagus should be tied as soon as possible after stunning to prevent rumen spillage onto other carcass parts (including head). GHP -based control measures The oesophagus should be tied to prevent rumen spillage; Equipment and tools sanitation . Step 7: Head removal and h ead washing Head is severed from the carcass in a hygienic manner. GHP -based control measures Removing heads in a manner that avoids contamination with gut content; Adequate washing of heads but to limit splashing and contamination of cheek meat; Equipmen t and tools sanitation . Step 8: Bunging/Tying the rectum This is the process where a cut is made around the anus to free the rectum from the carcass and then it is tied off and/or bagged to prevent faecal spillage. GHP -based control measures The rectum i s tied and covered with plastic bag (bunging) to prevent faecal spillage ; Equipment and tools sanitation . Step 9: Brisket opening GHP -based control measures Ensuring that the gastrointestinal tract is not ruptured; Equipment and tools sanitation . Page 162 of 164 Step 10 : Evisceration GHP -based control measures Knife trimming of potentially contaminated cut line before the cut is made; Ensuring that the gastrointestinal tract is not ruptured; Equipment and tools sanitation . Step 11: Carcass splitting GHP -based control measures Equipmen t and tools sanitation . Step 12: Post -mortem inspection Post -mortem inspection is the point where gross pathology is identified on carcasses, heads and offal, but at present is not an intervention measure to control microbiological contam ination. There is, however, possibility for microbial cross -contamination of carcasses if inspec tion is not performed in a hygienic manner. GHP -based control measures The procedure sho uld be performed to avoid cross -contamination; Equipment and tools sani tation . Step 13: Carcass p re-chill treatment This step in the process is used to clean ca rcass before subjecting it to chilling. A range of possible hazard -based interventions are available at this stage , but they may be also applied at other suitable sta ges. Hazard -based intervention measures Physical interventions aimed at removing microorg anisms (knife trimming, spot steam vacuuming, ambient water washes); Thermal interventions (hot water washes , steam vacuuming , steam pasteurisation ); h ypobromous acid, c hlorine dioxide , hydrogen peroxide ); Other chemical washes (cetylpyridiniu m chloride phosphoric acid , trisodium phosphate sodium metasilicate , etc); Other commercially available chemical formulations ; Biological intervention measures (nisin, lactoferrin , bacteriophages ). Page 163 of 164 Step 14: Chilling After the completion of the carcass dre ssing on the slaughterline, carcasses enter the cold chain. The antibacterial activity of air chilling on beef carcasses is mainly based on the surface desiccation by high air velocity. Chilling also inhibits microbial growth. GHP -based control measures Proper chilling conditions and parameters - carcass spacing, air flow, temperature and relative humidity . Hazard -based intervention measures Spray chilling (with water or addition of l actic or acetic acid , CPC, Step 15: Carcass fabrication This include cutting and deboning of the carcass meat which result in large primal joints and small mea t cuts. A primal cut or cut of meat is a piece of meat initially separated fro m the carcass during fabrication . Examples of primals include the round, loin, rib, and chuck for beef. Each primal cut is then reduced into subprimal cuts. Individual portions derived f rom subprimal cuts are referred to as fabricated cuts. GHP -based control measures Fat trimming ; Temperature controls in boning and fabrication room; Timely flow of the products to avoid microbial growth; Equipment and tools sanitation (knives, saws, slicers and food contact surfaces) as frequently as necessary. Hazard -base d intervention measures Chemical washes (organic acids, p eroxyacetic acid ); Non -thermal interventions (electron beam (E -beam) irradiation ). Step 16: Trim/Grinding During carcass fabrication, beef trim is generated and can be used for ground beef. GHP -based control measures Temperature controls in boning and fabrication room; Sanitation of equipment, tools and food contact surfaces as frequently as necessary . Page 164 of 164 Hazard -based intervention measures Thermal interventions (hot water, steam, hot air) Non -thermal interventions (electron beam (E -beam) and ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation ); Chemical washes ( as in previous steps ); Biological intervention measures (n isin, lactoferrin , bacteriophages ). Step 17: Packaging and storage Packaging protects finished products from contamination post -processing. Packaging -based interventions include mo difying the package environment ( modified atmosphere, vacuum packaging), the a ddition of microbial inhibitors , such as chemicals, biological extracts and lactic acid bacteria, and the application of non -thermal technologies (irradiation is typically applied at the pac kaging step but it could also be applied earlier at post -fabrication). GHP -based control measures Temperature controls in packaging room. Hazard -based interventio n measures Non -thermal interventions (electron beam (E -beam) and gamma irradiation , ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation , cold atmospheric plasma, high -pressure processing); Modified packaging (modified atmosphere packaging , vacuum packaging) ; Preservation and biopreservation (including active and bioactive packaging systems ). Step 18: Distribution to consumption The main GHP -based control measure here is strict maintenance of the cold chain. "}
