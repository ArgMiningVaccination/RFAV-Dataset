I was searching for a primary care provider and was very nervous because I really dislike \"going to the doctors\" and the whole hospital experience. New Wave Medicine is totally different. The atmosphere is very homey and relaxed, like you're going to a spa or a salon. Dr. Gundermann did a meet & greet with me to show me around and answer all my questions to set up a health plan & Dr. Bita is helping me with my weight loss goals. All in all, it has been such a great experience & I immediately signed up for their Direct Primary Care Membership which is such an amazing concept and WAY easier to manage than a typical doctor-patient set up. Love love love yall! :) CLINIC HOURS Monday - Friday 9 am - 5 pm CONTACT Phone: ( [425) 361-4521](tel:+1-425-361-4521) Fax: (888) 552-1864 OUR LOCATION 123 Wells Ave S Renton, WA 98057 Subscribe to Our Newsletter Join our email list and get access to specials deals "}
