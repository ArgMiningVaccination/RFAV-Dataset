Over the past few years, I've come down with several viruses, including [Epstein-Barr Virus](https://unmutedlife.com/blog), which is an acute form of mono that knocked me out for months back in 2017. I've had my share of respiratory, sinus and ear infections throughout my life, and, as a result, I've learned a lot about what we CAN do to potentially reduce our risk of getting sick. The most relevant and topical virus at the moment is COVID-19, so I wanted to share this infographic from the CDC with you, so you're aware of symptoms and preventive measures. Beyond that, I'll be sharing additional measures below that you can take to boost your immune system at a time when many of us are already dealing with suppressed immunity. Follow the recommendations outlined above and keep up to date with COVID by continuing to follow CDC guidelines [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/share-facts.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fshare-facts.html). Whenever I've gotten sick, I've been able to attribute my weakened immune system to NOT taking the proactive steps I've outlined below consistently. When I am following these steps, I don't get sick, or if I do, it's not for very long and it's less severe. The good news is that we CAN control certain risks that increase our likelihood of getting sick. We can practice social distancing, follow the guidelines above, and do our best to avoid sick people. Social distancing is helpful and recommended in times like we're in now because you could still be a carrier and could contaminate others, even if you don't get a particular virus. We can take other steps, too - steps that help us boost our immune system to make us more resilient in the face of exposure. Here's something I learned a few years ago that has stuck with me ever since: A virus needs a willing host. Think of a \"willing host\" as one that is overly stressed, sleep-deprived, malnourished, not taking care of themselves, and/or in a compromised state to begin with like little ones and the elderly. We can make ourselves less \"willing\" hosts by boosting our immune system. Just because you are exposed to a virus does not mean you will automatically get sick from it. What CAN We Do to Support Immunity? I've been a health coach for seven years and have a Master's degree in Health Science and a Bachelor's in Psychology. I've also been in the wellbeing industry for 13 years. That combined with life experience has taught me a LOT about how to be healthy. Here are five tried and true steps you can take to supercharge your immune system: 1) Catch Some Zzzs Lack of sleep (usually staying up too late) is the #1 trigger for many people to get sick. Though not the most glamorous piece of guidance, getting adequate, quality sleep is one of the best things we can do to [boost our immune system](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256323/). Our body uses sleep as a time to rest, repair and restore itself, so when we shortchange ourselves on sleep, we compromise our body's ability to fight back if we are exposed to a virus. High quality sleep also boosts our body's T cells, which fight off infection. Sleep disturbances not only [reduce our immune response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256323/) but have also been linked to [increased susceptibly to the common cold](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19139325). One of the best things we can do if we start to feel like we're coming down with something is to prioritize sleep and get a few extra hours of shut-eye. Since millions of people have trouble sleeping, try one of these tips to better sleep: Create a dark, cool, cave-like environment in your bedroom. Set your room temperature to between 65-67F. Block out as much light as possible, and clear out the clutter. We sleep better in cooler temperatures. My husband and I love [these bamboo sheets](https://www.amazon.com/Cosy-House-Collection-Queen-Sheets/dp/B00ZETJNQE)to wick away moisture and keep us cool as well. Take an Epsom salt bath. Taking a bath before bed raises our core body temperature. Stepping out of the bath drops our temperature, which stimulates the release of sleep-promoting compounds. The magnesium in epsom salts has a calming, relaxing effect on our muscles and mind, too. If you are looking at screens after dark, wear blue blocker glasses to block out the blue light. Doing so helps you reduce the stimulation of blue light emitted from your phone and other devices, which helps with melatonin production and reduces insomnia. Don't let Netflix binges mess with your sleep. I promise the shows will be there tomorrow! GO TO BED. You will never regret getting enough sleep. 2) Begin with the \"Gut\" Because [70-80% of our immune cells are located in and around our digestive system](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10564096), one of the first places we should focus on to boost our immunity is our \"gut.\" The bacteria in our gut [play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of our immune system](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3448089/) and our Western diet, rich in processed packaged foods, and the overutilization of antibiotics has been linked to [gut dysfunction and imbalances in our gut bacteria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3448089/%2523B46-nutrients-04-01095). Increasing our consumption of [prebiotics and probiotics](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24376446) is one way we can boost our digestive health and, therefore, our overall health. Prebiotics are fermentable fibers that feed probiotic bacteria. Sources of prebiotic foods include buckwheat, chicory, burdock root, onions, garlic, asparagus, green tea, and blueberries, to name a few. We also want to increase [consumption of traditional probiotic-rich foods](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24422720) like raw sauerkraut (make sure it is raw and in the refrigerated section - not cooked or canned on a shelf), miso, natto, kimchi, and kefir to promote a healthy gut. If there's absolutely no way you're going to try fermented foods, you can try a supplement, but know that the food-based sources are better. They're cheaper and more supercharged. Here's why: ONE 16-ounce jar of home-fermented sauerkraut (like HEX Ferments), has as many probiotics as EIGHT bottles of probiotic supplements containing 25 billion CFUs per pill. Some of my favorite brands of sauerkraut include HEX Ferments (local to Baltimore/DC), Farmhouse Culture, and Wildbrine. 3) Release the Tension Stress significantly [suppresses our immune function](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19571591). When we're in a state of elevated stress, our body's resources that would normally repair, replenish and restore the body are sent out to be on alert and keep us alive. We were never meant to remain in that state, but in times of uncertainty and hysteria, many of us feel stuck there, and we don't know how to get out of it. What can we do to release that tension? Laugh, move moderately (get outside take a walk or [practice yoga](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene)), meditate, practice deep breathing (here's [a video I posted](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rachelbdruckenmiller_linkedinvideo-covid19-motivation-activity-6645334732324376577-sqta) about that), take an Epsom salt bath, talk to a friend (better yet on FaceTime!), or turn on some of your favorite uplifting and fun music and \"shake it off.\" Watch this video (my fave!) or search \"laughing babies\" on YouTube for instant stress relief! 4) Stay Connected My friend, [Enrique Rubio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubioenrique/en), sent out an email today that said this: \"Social distancing does NOT mean social isolation.\" I couldn't agree more. [Social isolation is an immune suppressant](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/11/29/457255876/loneliness-may-warp-our-genes-and-our-immune-systems). That's why it's more important than ever to find new ways of connecting with people to get the support we need for our mental health and wellbeing, especially in times of social distancing: Call a loved one, using video if possible, or use the [Marco Polo](https://www.marcopolo.me/)app for video messaging Download the [NextDoor app](https://nextdoor.com/)to connect with and check in on your neighbors Schedule video conferencing calls instead of phone calls or in-person meetings Pull out some stamps and envelopes and write handwritten notes to those you love, letting them know what you appreciate about them. It will make you feel better as you write it and them feel better as they read it! Use a telephonic counseling service like [BetterHelp](https://www.betterhelp.com/) 5) Nourish Your Body Chronic stress depletes our body of nutrients, so upgrading our nutrition to support our body is especially critical during this time. All of us have heard about the importance of having a colorful diet, but this catchy acronym from Dr. Joel Fuhrman puts a new spin on that age-old advice. One way to remember some of the most nutrient-dense foods is using the acronym \"G-BOMBS,\" which stands for Greens, Beans, Onions, Mushrooms, Berries and Seeds. I've written in more detail about them [here](https://rachelsnourishingkitchen.com/eat-your-gbombs/). These nutrient-dense foods are packed with anti-inflammatory phytochemicals (think \"fight-o-chemicals\"), antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that [work together to supercharge our immune system](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23495421). Leafy greens like kale, spinach, Swiss chard and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower have antiviral and [immune-boosting properties](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3868788/). Compounds from onions and other members of the allium vegetable family, like garlic, leeks, shallots and scallions thin mucus and have been found to have [anti-asthmatic and antibiotic effects.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12410539) Beans are rich in prebiotic fiber that helps feed the good bacteria in our digestive system. Believe it or not, [mushrooms are also a significant immune booster](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald/mushrooms-breast-cancer_b_1070744.html) and have strong antiviral and antibacterial properties. I love using certain teas like the brand Host Defense that are full of medicinal mushrooms. For more about the healing power of mushrooms, check out the TEDTalk below. Whether you enjoy them in salads, smoothies, soups, stews, stocks, steamed or saut\u00e9ed, add more G-BOMBS to your diet to boost your immunity. For more on G-BOMBS and research behind them, go [here](https://www.drfuhrman.com/elearning/eat-to-live-blog/62/the-healthiest-anti-cancer-foods-g-bombs). In addition, there are several supplements that [my functional medicine nutritionist ](http://www.kasiakines.com/)recommended I take when I was fighting Epstein-Barr Virus because of their strong anti-viral properties: Licorice Root Extract: One of the strongest [anti-viral](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27815461)sources out there, I took this every either in the form of tea or a capsule from Vital Nutrients. Licorice root is contraindicated for people with hypertension, as it increases blood pressure. Buddha Teas and Traditional Medicinals make a licorice root tea. Selenium: strengthens and amino acid](http://pennstatehershey.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=107&pid=33&gid=000312#:~:text=Lysine%20has%20antiviral%20effects%20by,and%20duration%20of%20an%20outbreak.)
