If your dog can't pee, that's a true emergency that needs immediate surgery. But if your dog has a milder case ... you may have the luxury of time to choose natural options. Manage Bladder Stones Naturally Some dogs are prone to recurring bladder stones. So you can use some of these natural approaches for prevention too. Here are some dietary and herbal approaches to managing bladder stones for your dog. 1. Make Sure Your Dog Drinks Lots Of Water This may seem obvious. But, no matter what type of stones your dog has ... don't underestimate the power of water to help. It's an important part of bladder stone management that vets often overlook. Most dogs develop bladder stones when they are on kibble. Moisture in kibble is only 9% to 11%. A raw diet contains 80% or more moisture. Keep your dog well hydrated to dilute minerals in the urine. This can help prevent stones from forming. Feeding a high moisture diet is a good start. If you've ever switched a dog from kibble to raw ... you'll have seen how much less water your dog drinks on a raw diet. Make sure your dog has ready access to ample filtered or spring water ( [not tap water](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/dangers-dog-water/)). Some things that can encourage your dog to drink more are ... - More water bowls around the house and yard - Flavoring the water with broth - Water fountains with running water - Feeding bone broth or adding it to food But keep it voluntary. Don't ever force your dog to drink more than he wants. And of course, with increased drinking, make sure he gets plenty of opportunities to go out to pee. 2. Feed Foods That Help Prevent Bladder Stones Whatever your dog's condition, feeding a fresh, whole food diet is the healthiest strategy. Avoid highly processed, starchy kibble diets, especially if your dog has struvite stones. And this includes prescription diets your vet might try to persuade you to feed. These diets might help short term ... but they offer very poor nutrition for your dog. RELATED: [Why you should avoid prescription diets ...](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/calling-bullhit-prescription-diet-dog-food/) Instead, here are some dietary recommendations for the different types of stones. Homeopath and Certified Canine Nutritionlist Brenda Tobin DiHom, DVetHom, Cert CN offers the advice below on diets for struvite and calcium oxalate stones. Food To Manage Struvite Stones Dogs develop struvite stones when their urine is alkaline and saturated with magnesium and phosphate. Struvite stones usually stem from bacterial infections. Dogs who produce a high concentration of urea may be more susceptible to struvite stones. That's because bacterial urease converts urea to ammonia, a component of struvite. Animal proteins are acidifying. So, to manage struvite stones, feed your dog a raw meat based diet with other acidic foods. INCLUDE Acidic Foods For Struvite Stones - Chicken (be sure this is organic and free range) - Beef - Eggs - Pork - Cottage cheese - Brown rice - Black beans - Chickpeas - Kidney beans AVOID Alkaline Foods For Struvite Stones - Broccoli - All sprouts - Cabbage - Pumpkin - Asparagus - Carrots - Cucumbers [Green beans](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/can-dogs-eat-green-beans/) - Peas - Kale - Spinach - Sweet potatoes - Swiss chard - Fruit: bananas, apples, pineapple, strawberries Food For Calcium Oxalate Stones Oxalate crystals form when oxalates are excreted in the urine. They bind to calcium, which then forms calcium oxalate stones. Urine that's high in calcium oxalate crystals is acidic and needs more alkaline or neutral foods. Make sure any supplements you give don't contain excessive amounts of vitamin C. It's acidifying. FEED Low Oxalate Foods - Beef - Chicken - Turkey - Organ meats - Clams - Fish like cod, whitefish, salmon, oysters - Eggs - Fruit - apples, pears, watermelon, banana, lemon, pineapple - Veggies - broccoli, Brussels sprouts. asparagus, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumber, mushrooms, lettuce - Herbs - parsley, peppermint, garlic, ginger, basil AVOID High Oxalate Foods - Peanuts - Legumes - lentils, beans (black, white, navy) - Turmeric - Soy - Grains - wheat, corn, rice - Fruits - apricots, figs - Veggies - collard, mustard greens, sweet potatoes, okra Food For Urate Stones Dogs like Dalmatians who are prone to urate stones need to eat low purine diets. Feed a fresh, whole food diet focusing on low and medium purine foods from the list below. Avoid high purine foods. FEED Low and Medium Purine Foods - Green leafy vegetables (except spinach) - Eggs - Dairy products (plain yogurt, kefir, low fat cottage cheese) - Nuts (not macadamia as they can be toxic to dogs) - Muscle meats from chicken, turkey, lamb, pork and beef - Oats and oatmeal - Fruits You can feed [green tripe](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/five-foods-dog/) can be fed in moderation - once a week. It's medium to high in purines. But it also has many benefits. It provides enzymes and bacteria that help with digestion and improve metabolism. AVOID High Purine Foods - Organs/offal (brain, heart, liver, kidneys) - Game - Duck - Goose - Yeast (including nutritional and brewers yeast) - Oily fish like mackerel, herring, sardines - Mussels - Scallops - Spinach - Cauliflower - Mushrooms - Peas - Legumes (such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas) Other Foods That Can Help Prevent Bladder Stones There are also other foods that can help prevent bladder stones in your dog. Cranberries Cranberries can be a good addition to your dog's diet to help prevent struvite stones. Research shows cranberries can help manage and prevent UTIs. Infections are often at the root of struvite stone formation. Cranberries also create more acidity in your dog, which helps prevent struvite stones. Always buy organic cranberries. It's a fruit that's otherwise grown with a lot of pesticides. If your dog will eat whole cranberries, sprinkle a few on his food to start. Unsweetened freeze-dried cranberries can be another good option. Sometimes it's easier to just use a cranberry supplement.

But in general, try to keep your dog's pH neutral, around 7.0. Bladder stones can be painful and even life-threatening. But there are many natural approaches that can help manage them. Even if your dog has to have stones removed, the right food and herbs can help prevent a recurrence. [References] Lulich JPet al.
