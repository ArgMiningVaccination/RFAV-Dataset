DR.D.HARSHAD Ayurveda Doctor Ayurveda and Naturopathy look similar by the way of their approach towards healing. Both the sciences adopt natural remedies for the cure, focus on detoxifying the body, encourage abstinence from unhealthy lifestyle and promote using food as the medicine. The main difference comes in the way foods are chosen. Naturopathy says food must be consumed as raw or half cooked. The nutrients in the food should reach the body as such for the body to get the benefit. While Ayurveda advocates food to be cooked with spices to impart good assimilation and reward better health. Naturopath tries to heal the disease and remove the toxins by choosing the dietary regimen and natural products like mud, clay, water therapies while Ayurveda give importance to herbal remedies along with dietary regimen. It must be understood that both Ayurveda and Naturopathy are complimenting to each other for attaining a healthy lifestyle irrespective of the ideology. Even though Ayurveda and Naturopathy are natural systems of medicine, they are entirely different fields of practice. Naturopathy concentrates on the body's ability to heal itself. Ayurveda integrates the body, senses, mind and soul to prevent and cure ailments with medications, external and internal therapies and life style changes. Naturopathy adopts measures like natural therapies, nutrition and acupuncture to promote the self-healing power of the body. ayurveda trails pvt | \u00a9 2018 "}
