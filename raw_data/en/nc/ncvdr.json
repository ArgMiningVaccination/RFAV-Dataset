Each compass direction on the wheel offers lessons and gifts that support the development of a balanced individual. The idea is to remain balanced at the center of the wheel while developing equally the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of one's personality. The concept of the medicine wheel varies among Native peoples: different groups attribute different gifts to positions on the wheel. But the following offers a generalized overview of some lessons and gifts connected with the development process. Lessons and gifts from the EAST, the place of first light, spring, and birth, include: Warmth of the spirit Purity, trust, and hope Unconditional love Courage Truthfulness Guidance and leadership Capacity to remain in the present moment Lessons a nd gifts from the SOUTH, the place of summer and youth, include: Generosity, sensitivity, and loyalty Romantic love Testing of the physical body/self -control Gifts of music and art Capacity to express feelings openly in ways respectful to others Lessons and gifts from the WEST, the place of autumn and adulthood, include: Dreams, prayers, and meditation Perseverance when challenged Balance between passionate loyalty and spiritual insight Use of personal objects, sacred objects Understanding of life's meaning Fasting, ceremony, self -knowledge, and vision Lessons and gifts from the NORTH, the place of winter and elders, include: Intellectual wisdom Ability to complete tasks that began as a vision Detachment from hate, jealousy, desire, anger, and fear Ability to see the past, present, and future as interrelated SOURCE: Bopp, J.,Bopp, M., Brown, L.,& Lane Jr., P.

Was there a particular point in the timeline that was especially significant or important? What did you learn from the experience? How would you help a friend or someone else if they were going through the same thing? Have them share something about what they learned with the group. \"You inspired me...\" Have students write a letter or create a poster of someone in their local community who has inspired them. For example, a student is inspired by his or her grandmother or grandfather to learn hunting, trapping, cooking, beading, quilting, or other traditions.
