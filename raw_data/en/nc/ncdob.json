MENVEO is a vaccine used for active immunisation of children (from the age of 2 months), adolescents and adults to prevent invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. Meningitis is an infection of the spinal fluid and the tissues that surround the brain. Of the microbes that cause meningitis, one of the most severe is Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus). Meningococcal meningitis is an infectious disease that is spread from person to person. It is a very serious disease and is sometimes fatal. It can cause permanent physical and neurological damage. MENVEO can only protect you or your child from meningitis caused by four groups of Neisseria meningitidis (A, C, W-135 and Y). It will not protect you or your child from meningitis caused by other groups of Neisseria meningitidis or from meningitis caused by different kinds of microbes. MENVEO works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against meningococcal bacteria. Your body usually takes a couple of weeks after vaccination to develop protection against Neisseria meningitidis. If a vaccinated person comes into contact with Neisseria meningitidis, the body is usually able to destroy it. However, as with all vaccines, 100% protection cannot be guaranteed. Sometimes individuals may react unfavourably to the vaccine. The chance of a severe reaction from MENVEO is very small but the risks from not being vaccinated against meningococcal disease may be very serious. 2. What should I know before I receive MENVEO? Warnings Do not receive MENVEO if: - you are allergic to MENVEO or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet Always check the ingredients to make sure you can use this medicine. - you have ever had an allergic reaction to diphtheria toxoid (a substance used in other vaccines) - you have a very high fever In this case your vaccination with MENVEO may have to be delayed. Discuss this with your doctor or nurse before you receive MENVEO. - you have had an allergic reaction or become unwell after receiving another meningococcal vaccine - you have a severe infection with a high temperature A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem however talk to your doctor or nurse about this before being vaccinated. Check with your doctor if you: - have any other medical conditions including any that involve your immune system - have a low blood platelet count - receive treatment that blocks the part of the immune system known as complement activation, such as eculizumab Even if you have been vaccinated with MENVEO you can remain at increased risk of disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y. - take any medicines for any other condition - have an allergy to latex - have had an allergic reaction after any other vaccination. Symptoms include difficulty breathing, swelling of the throat, fits (convulsions) including fits associated with fevers, high fevers and severe reactions at the injection site. You may be at risk of developing certain side effects. It is important you understand these risks and how to monitor for them. See additional information under [Section 6. Are there any side effects?](#s6) Pregnancy and breastfeeding Check with your doctor if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Talk to your doctor if you are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. They will discuss with you the benefits and risks of receiving MENVEO during pregnancy or whilst breastfeeding. Fainting Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle infection. Tell the person giving you your injection if you or your child have ever fainted with a previous injection. 3. What if I am taking other medicines? Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any other medicines, including any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Some medicines may interfere with MENVEO and affect how it works. Tell your doctor or nurse if you or your child have had any vaccines recently. MENVEO may be given at the same time as other vaccinations. Other vaccines must be injected into a different arm or leg (for children aged 2-23 months) from the site of the MENVEO injection. These include: - tetanus, reduced diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine - human papillomavirus vaccine Check with your doctor or nurse if you are not sure about what medicines, vitamins or supplements you are taking and if these affect MENVEO. 4. How do I receive MENVEO?

You should immediately: - phone the Poisons Information Centre (by calling 13 11 26), or - contact your doctor, or - go to the Emergency Department at your nearest hospital. You should do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. 5. What should I know after receiving MENVEO? Things you should do - keep a record of your vaccination history Driving or using machines Be careful before you drive or use any machines or tools until you know how MENVEO affects you. Looking after your medicine - MENVEO will usually be stored at the doctor's clinic or at the pharmacy. - If you need to store MENVEO it is important to keep it in the refrigerator between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C in the original pack. - Do not freeze MENVEO. - Following reconstitution and in order to reduce microbiological hazard, MENVEO should be used as soon as practicable after reconstitution.
