What are the different methods to detoxify our bodies? Let's learn the importance of detoxification through Ayurveda here. In the human body, we tend to accumulate toxins daily due to the different mechanisms of digestion. The body undergoes many processes, where the food we eat gets digested with the help of digestive juices and enzymes; pass through the 'Srotas' (channels) to reach every part of the body. During this process, certain toxins will be produced as residue and the body eliminates it through urine, feces, and sweat. This happens on a daily basis. Due to the sedentary lifestyle and changed food habits, our body produces 'Ama' (undigested food or toxins), blocking the nourishment and reducing its functionality. Ayurveda has categorized diseases into two origins. - 'Santarpanajanya' and 'Apatarpanajanya'. For easy learning, it can be understood as diseases that occur due to over nourishment and undernourishment, respectively. Out of both, the former is difficult to treat as it needs detailed detoxification therapies to resolve the condition. Undergo Detox; When your body needs help! The purpose of an Ayurvedic detox is to get rid of the unwanted toxins in the body. The toxins block the 'Srotas' and disrupt the flow of nutrients to cells, as well as the body's natural waste removal systems.

Detoxification with Ayurveda When we talk about detoxification in Ayurveda, it mainly refers to the Panchakarma therapies. Panchakarma, as the name implies, has five karmas that help to eliminate the Ama or toxins in the body safely and effectively. Removing these toxins is the first step towards the healing process. The whole process not only initiates toxin removal but also rejuvenates the system completely and restores the mind-body balance. Detoxification Ayurveda medicines are widely explained in the ancient treatise. Panchakarma includes - - Vamana (Therapeutic emesis) - Virechana (Induced - Vasti (Medicated Enema) - Nasya (Elimination of toxins through the nose) - Raktamokshana (Bloodletting) Vamana - Therapeutic Emesis When there is congestion in the lungs, it may result in bronchitis, cold, cough, or asthma. Vamana treatment helps to remove the excess phlegm or mucous from the body. Once this excess mucous is released, the patient would feel instant relief. The congestion and breathlessness would also be gone. Vamana is indicated in conditions of chronic asthma, diabetes mellitus, acute sinusitis, lymphatic blocks, severe indigestion, and inflammatory conditions. After the procedure, the patient will experience a clear chest, clarity in all sense organs, breathe freely, good appetite, and relaxed sleep. Virechana - Unique detox through purgation When excess bile, pitta, is excessively secreted in the body, it may result in various diseases in the body. Ayurvedic classics suggest therapeutic laxatives to resolve the condition. After virechana, the excess pitta gets into control and the patient feels better. Ayurvedic medicines used for evacuation help to cleanse the colon, stomach, liver, and spleen in particular. This is also one of the excellent ways to increase metabolism. Virechana resolves the conditions like pitta imbalance, hyperacidity, colitis, migraine, chronic headaches, allergies, and several skin diseases like dermatitis, eczema, etc. It also provides great relief in gastric ulcer treatment. Vasti - The king of all therapies Vata dosha plays a very active role in initiating many functions in the body. It is the main force behind all the actions, including coordination, elimination of waste, and many more. The seat of Vata is told to be at the level of the large intestine, but it also resides in the joints and bones. Hence any medicament through vasti easily rectifies the asthi dhatu. The mucous membrane of the colon has a close relationship with the outer covering of the bones (periosteum), which helps to nourish the bones. Therefore, any medicine given rectal orifice goes deeper into the tissues, like bones, and easily treats the Vata dysfunction. They also possess strong anti-inflammatory properties. Vasti treatments are classified under two headings, namely Niruha Vasti and Anuvasana Vasti. Ayurvedic medicine is chosen and administered as per the patient's body condition and treatment requirements. Anuvasana Vasti is the enema done using medicated oils, whereas Niruha Vasti is done with a mix of herbal decoction. The medicine is administered via the anal route. Nasya - Nasal drop administration The nose is the pathway to the brain and consciousness. The nasal administration of drops helps to clear the excess Kapha located above the neck region like sinuses, throat, nose, or head areas. Nasya is indicated in conditions of prana disorders, sinus congestions, migraine headaches, convulsions, and certain diseases of the eye and ears. The procedure also aids better breathing. Raktamokshana - Purifies and cleanses your blood! Raktamokshana is derived two words Rakta meaning 'blood' and mokshana implying 'liberation'. The treatment literally 'releases' impure blood from the system and improves circulatory health. It helps to cure skin conditions such as urticaria, rashes, eczema, acne, scabies, leukoderma, chronic itching, or hives. In such conditions, raktamokshana will be beneficial along with internal medications. The procedure also checks on excess pitta deposition in the blood and removes the toxins generated due to it.
