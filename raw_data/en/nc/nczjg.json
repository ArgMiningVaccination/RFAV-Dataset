Naturopathic treatment can provide an alternative approach to broaden the scope of treatment for lichen sclerosus. What is lichen sclerosus? Lichen sclerosus is a longterm inflammatory skin condition that causes thinning and scarring of the skin. It is not known why, but lichen sclerosus often affects the genitals and anal region. Ongoing inflammation and thinning of the skin can lead to fissures and bruising, causing irritation, vaginal itching, and pain. What does conventional treatment for lichen sclerosus entail?

Hormonal imbalances, such as estrogen deficiencies have been seen in various vaginal skin conditions. In addition, thyroid hormones and stress hormone imbalances can also contribute to inflammation in the body. Thus, natural treatment for lichen sclerosus begins with a thorough assessment of female hormones, thyroid hormones, and stress hormones to address underlying hormone imbalances. Research also suggests that there may be an autoimmune component to lichen sclerosus and ongoing mast cell activation, meaning that the body is attacking itself and creating inflammation. Treatment for lichen sclerosus also involves addressing inflammation topically and internally, as well as addressing the autoimmune component. In other words, we need to control the body so that it is not attacking itself and creating more inflammation. Gut health also plays a pivotal role in chronic inflammation in the body. We also have to consider food sensitivities that may be contributing to inflammation and autoimmunity in the body. Removing these food triggers can further help us manage lichen sclerosus.
