But nowadays, a clean planet is even more important. Luckily for you, you can have both thanks to our conscious companies that are finding innovative, zero waste ways to package and produce their cleaning tools, formulas, and products. They get the job done with ease (whatever the job may be!) and leave fewer chemicals and pollution behind for our Earth to deal with. Win-win. Read on below to learn about the benefits of natural cleaning products, and some of our favorites for tackling messes in every corner of the house! What you'll learn: - Why chemical-free cleaning formulas are safer for your family, and the planet - How to choose products that work for your lifestyle - How to tackle every room of your house, from dirty dishes to messy bathrooms Benefits of Non-Toxic Cleaning Formulas They're safe for children and pets! Tired of evacuating the bathroom for hours after you clean it with harsh chemicals so that little ones don't get overwhelmed with chemical-laden fumes? Unlike conventional cleaners, which can contain health-disrupting toxins (check out some toxins to avoid [here](https://earthhero.com/7-toxic-chemicals-to-avoid-in-your-products/)!), natural cleaning products can be safely used around children of all ages. In fact, they can even join in on the cleaning when you use non-toxic formulas and begin to create healthy habits around their chores. While we still recommend adult supervision and suggest keeping the cabinet where you keep your cleaning products guarded against pets and little ones, you can clean worry-free knowing your products won't be creating long-term damage. They promote healthier indoor, and outdoor, air quality! Look at the back of your conventional chemical-based cleaning products and you'll likely see a giant warning label urging you to not breathe in the fumes. Which... frankly... is pretty hard to do if you're deep cleaning smaller spaces like your bathroom. [According to the EPA](http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/insidest.html), the air quality inside homes can be 2-5x more polluted than the air just outside the home - and cleaning products play a huge role in that! They protect our natural resources! Conventional cleaning products like laundry detergents and fragranced aerosol sprays are often petroleum-based, which is a non-renewable natural resource that is extremely intensive to extract and transform. When we use large quantities of these petroleum-based, toxic products near sources of water (think down the bathtub drain!) it becomes nearly impossible for wastewater treatment plants to treat a large volume of these chemicals before they go to our aquatic ecosystems. Over time, this can negatively impact all sorts of wildlife and habitats - [similarly to how microplastics accumulate](https://earthhero.com/what-are-microplastics/)! Now that you know why... let's get into how! Laundry Room [Soap Nuts](https://earthhero.com/products/home/eco-nuts-soap-nuts-laundry-detergent/) If single-use laundry pods are your thing, switch them out with soap nuts! Unlike Tide Pods and other laundry detergent pods, these soap nuts are 100% plastic-free, non-toxic, and chemical free - because they come from dried berries from trees in the Himalayas... not a factory. When the soap nuts are agitated in water they release saponin, which is a natural cleanser and fabric softener. Plus, they can be reused for several washes and then composted when you're done with them. There's also a [liquid detergent made from soapberry extract](https://earthhero.com/products/home/eco-nuts-organic-liquid-laundry-detergent-16oz/), which is just as sustainable and comes inside an aluminum bottle instead of just being loose soap nuts. [Powdered Detergent](https://earthhero.com/products/home/meliora-natural-powder-laundry-detergent/) Want a cleaner & greener laundry detergent, but not ready to make the switch to soapberries? Powdered laundry detergent, packaged in refillable and reusable steel containers, is another great option! Made from concentrated ingredients like baking soda, washing powder, vegetable-based soap, and essential oils, powdered detergent can be used in both standard and HE style washing machines and easily removes stains and stink from all clothing types. No SLS, synthetic fragrances, dyes, plastic-packaging or optical brighteners needed. Plus, the canister can be refilled with more powdered detergent for a fraction of the cost of conventional detergents. [Cora Ball](https://earthhero.com/products/home/cora-ball-microfiber-laundry-ball/) While it's important to ensure we aren't sending toxic chemicals to our aquatic ecosystems through the washing machine, it's also important to learn about the role of microplastics when washing our clothes. You can get the full scoop with the [microplastic blog here](https://earthhero.com/what-are-microplastics/), but to put it simply: when you wash clothes made from synthetic materials they release microscopic plastic threads that won't biodegrade for hundreds of years. Plus, they get into the belly of animals and can cause a slew of health impacts for animals and people alike. That's where the Cora Ball comes in. Made from 100% recycled plastic, this scientist-tested ball captures and collects microplastics and microthreads that are released from your clothes so they don't make it into our waterways. Just toss it in the washer drum with your laundry detergent of choice, and give it a few weeks to build up microparticles before you remove them manually and throw them in the trash where they belong. [Dryer Balls](https://earthhero.com/products/home/eco-nuts-wool-dryer-balls-4pk/) Now that your clothes are clean, it's time to dry them. Instead of tossing them in with single-use dryer sheets (which are full of chemicals and can actually damage your clothes), make the switch to reusable dryer balls. Made from ethically harvested & cruelty-free wool, they work by separating and lifting clothes to dry them faster and with less static. In fact, dryer balls are so effective that they can save you both energy and money. You can even drop some essential oils into the wool dryer balls for that \"fresh-out-the-dryer\" smell. [Spot-Treatment Stain Stick](https://earthhero.com/products/home/bestowed-essentials-natural-laundry-stain-stick/) Last but not least on the laundry lineup: stain sticks. Messes happen.. And sometimes you need ultra-concentrated cleaning power to handle them. But lots of stain sticks out there contain tons of bleaches, optical whiteners, and other toxic chemicals that are overkill. Natural laundry stain sticks, made from concentrated vegetable soaps, are a natural way to pre-treat tough stains before washing clothes to ensure they get 100% clean. Simply wet the spot, rub the treatment on, and toss it in the wash. [Here](https://earthhero.com/products/home/bestowed-essentials-natural-laundry-stain-stick/) is one we love with added baking soda, and [here](https://earthhero.com/products/home/meliora-natural-laundry-stain-stick/) is one we love without it. Bathroom [All-Purpose Cleaning Spray](https://earthhero.com/products/home/meliora-natural-all-purpose-home-cleaning-spray/) Every household on the planet needs a high-quality cleaning spray for spills, smudges, and general life messes. But... most conventional cleaning sprays contain toxic phthalates, which are beginning to be studied in connection with long-term health impacts, and are almost always packaged in plastic. Ditch the single-use spray bottles and switch to a formula that works hard - so you don't have to. This all-purpose cleaning spray comes with a reusable glass spray bottle and a steel canister of \"cleaning flakes\" made from toxin-free vegetable soap that are cruelty-free, SLS-free, and safe to use in any part of your home. Plus, you'll save money: 18 refills of cleaner is only $8... that's 44 cents a full bottle of surface cleaner. [Soft Scrub](https://earthhero.com/products/home/meliora-gentle-home-cleaning-soft-scrub/) Some messes, like those in the grout between your bathroom tile, require a little more elbow grease. This soft scrub powder from Meliora gets the job done, allowing you to really get to work in your spring deep cleaning. This scrub is safe to use on stainless steel, ceramic/porcelain tile, and most stovetops. [Here](https://earthhero.com/products/home/meliora-gentle-home-cleaning-soft-scrub/) is an awesome soft scrub, and [here](https://earthhero.com/products/home/eco-nuts-natural-clean-all-scouring-powder/) is a similar 'scouring powder'. Don't let corporate marketing fool you into thinking you need ultra strength chemical cleaners to get those tough to clean spots. These soft scrubs get the job done, without industrial strength toxins! [Floor Cleaner](https://earthhero.com/products/home/eco-nuts-orange-citrus-spray-mop-organic-floor-cleaner/) Up next in your spring cleaning to-do list is the floors! For sparkling tile, wood, and vinyl floors try [this](https://earthhero.com/products/home/eco-nuts-orange-citrus-spray-mop-organic-floor-cleaner/) USDA Certified Organic floor cleaner. Made with essential oils and botanical extracts, this citrus spray is packaged in a reusable, recyclable aluminum bottle-so you have less plastic, and fewer toxins in your home. To use, simply spray on the floor and run a sweeper style mop (think Swiffer-style!) around until your floor is sparkling clean! Kitchen + Dishes [Castile Dish Soap](https://earthhero.com/products/home/bestowed-essentials-handmade-castile-soap-dish-washing-block/) We all wish our dishwashers (if you have one!) could clean everything in our kitchen... but for now... we still need to use dish soap to clean those pots, pans, knives, and cutting boards. Say goodbye to those wasteful (non-recyclable!) plastic bottles from used dish soap and say hello to castile dish soap blocks. Castile soap, basically just meaning a ultra-concentrated vegetable-based soap, is plastic, paraben, sulfate, and cruelty-free. It uses french green clay, sea salt, and natural oils to lather and cleanse dishes with ease. Pair with a natural loofah or sisal washcloth for a 100% zero waste clean! [Veggie Wash](https://earthhero.com/products/home/eco-nuts-organic-veggie-wash/) Did you know that seemingly 'fresh' produce can often be coated with pesticides, dirt, wax, and other byproducts from the production and harvesting process? And while cleaning with water is an important step, sometimes it's not enough! This USDA Certified Organic veggie wash is a great way to clean any and all produce before you eat it to ensure you're not consuming anything but truly clean fruits and veggies. To use, simply spray onto veggies, allow to sit for 30 seconds, then scrub under running water. For softer items like berries, dilute 1-2 oz of the veggie wash in a bowl with the produce, allow to soak for 30 seconds, then rinse. [Surface Cleaner](https://earthhero.com/products/home/eco-nuts-organic-lime-citrus-surface-cleaner/) & [Glass Cleaner](https://earthhero.com/products/home/eco-nuts-lemon-citrus-organic-glass-cleaner/) Tired of feeling like you need a hazmat suit to spray down the surfaces in your kitchen? From smudged fridges, to dirty glass cabinets, it's important to have a good cleaning spray that can be used every day - without posing a risk to your family's health. This [organic surface cleaner](https://earthhero.com/products/home/eco-nuts-organic-lime-citrus-surface-cleaner/) and [glass cleaner](https://earthhero.com/products/home/eco-nuts-lemon-citrus-organic-glass-cleaner/) are safe for daily use near food prep areas because they're ammonia-free, phosphate-free, and alcohol-free, and leave behind a gentle scent from essential oils that isn't overpowering for the kitchen. Essential Cleaning Tools Now that you know why, and how, to make the switch to non-toxic cleaning products, it's time to take what you've learned and put it into action. Conventional cleaning tools can be extremely wasteful, but we've rounded up some of our favorites to help you not only keep your house clean, but the planet as well! [Natural Latex Cleaning Gloves](https://earthhero.com/products/home/full-circle-home-splash-patrol-natural-latex-gloves/) Even though at this point you have switched over to only toxin-free cleaning products that won't irritate your skin, it's still a great idea to keep a pair of cleaning gloves on hand to protect you from hot water when cleaning and potentially dry skin. We've got you covered (literally). These natural latex gloves are slip-resistant, and feature 100% cotton cuffs to keep water from dripping down your arms. The inside is ultra-soft and comfortable, and they're BPA, phthalate, and PVC-free. The partner [Bottle](https://earthhero.com/product-category/home/cleaning/?fwp_type=bottle-brushes) + [Straw Brushes](https://earthhero.com/search/straw%20brush) Your reusable bottles and straws are a great way to keep extra plastic out of the landfill, but they can be notoriously hard to clean. By investing in a brush specifically made for this task, you can save yourself a lot of time and effort. When it comes to bottle brushes there are a few options, including some with replaceable heads like [this one](https://earthhero.com/products/travel/clean-reach-replaceable-full-circle-bottle-brush/), and others with various shapes for different types of bottles like [this one](https://earthhero.com/products/home/full-circle-home-reach-two-sided-bottle-brush/). Take an inventory of what kinds of items you'll need to clean - and pick which one works best for you. For straw brushes, it's a little more straightforward when it comes to choices. Some are [extra long](https://earthhero.com/products/travel/simply-straws-extra-long-straw-cleaning-brush/), some are [colorful](https://earthhero.com/products/travel/u-konserve-marine-straw-brush/), and some are just classic like [this one](https://earthhero.com/products/travel/u-konserve-straw-brush/). Whatever you choose be sure you keep it sink-side so you can clean out your bottles + straws after each use! [Scrubber Sponges](https://earthhero.com/products/home/full-circle-walnut-scrubber-sponge/) and [Dish Brushes](https://earthhero.com/products/home/be-good-full-circle-dish-brush/) A high-quality sponge or dish brush is essential for any cleaning project - whether you're scrubbing dishes, cleaning countertops, or tackling grit and grime. But... many conventionals options are made from virgin plastic (that comes from non-renewable petroleum!) and have a pretty short lifecycle before they head to the landfill. Instead of buying wasteful plastic-based sponges, you can switch to an exfoliating sponge made from cellulose and walnut shells like [this one](https://earthhero.com/products/home/full-circle-walnut-scrubber-sponge/) - it can be composted after hundreds of uses! The natural walnut shells won't shed microplastic pieces down the drain, either. Or try our [100% zero-waste loofah scrubbers](https://earthhero.com/products/home/brush-with-bamboo-heirloom-mayan-loofah-scrubbers-6pk/) that are made from unprocessed, chemical free heirloom Mayan loofahs that can also be composted when you're done using them. You can get a 6 pack of smaller loofah scrubbers, or one large 4 inch loofah [here](https://earthhero.com/products/home/bestowed-essentials-natural-loofah-sponge/) - so that you have a scrubber for every assignment. If you're not a fan of sponges and loofahs, and prefer a traditional dish brush, there's a ton of ways to reduce the amount of plastic they are made from. [This](https://earthhero.com/products/home/be-good-full-circle-dish-brush/) dish brush flaunts a natural bamboo handle, and a BPA-free recycled plastic head & bristles to help reduce the amount of virgin plastic used. Small but mighty, [this](https://earthhero.com/products/home/bubble-up-full-circle-dish-brush-set/) handle-free dish brush also relies on natural bamboo and recycled plastic to get the job done. Looking for something with a [replaceable head](https://earthhero.com/products/home/full-circle-home-suds-up-dish-sponge/) is also a great way to reduce the amount of waste you produce. Whether you choose a dish brush, or a sponge-alternative, make sure you look for ethical materials, responsible production methods, and features that you know you'll need when cleaning. [Reusable Dish Towels](https://earthhero.com/products/home/tidy-full-circle-dish-cloths/) Paper towels: they come from trees (one of our most important natural resources!), they're single-use, and let's face it - they kind of suck for cleaning up messes. A great way to reduce paper towel waste and save yourself some money is to switch to reusable dish towels made from sustainable materials. Organic cotton towels like [these](https://earthhero.com/products/home/tidy-full-circle-dish-cloths/) are easy to clean + dry with, ultra-absorbent, and even have embedded loops for additional scrubbing power. Or, for a more refined look, you can try stonewashed linen towels like [these](https://earthhero.com/product-category/linencasa/?fwp_type=kitchen-towels)! Whatever material floats your boat, made sure it's a natural material like cellulose, linen, or cotton - and "}
