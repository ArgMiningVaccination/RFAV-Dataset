Bresciani describes the university as a place where students can succeed academically and personally through learning, involvement, service and leadership. \"NDSU is unique nationally in that it is a land-grant, research-based and student-focused university,\" he said. \"That combination provides what few others institutions do, and our students are realizing the benefits.\" An Historical Perspective of NDSU A Bit of History North Dakota had been a state less than a year when Governor John Miller signed a bill on March 8, 1890, designating a square mile of land adjoining Fargo as the site of the new campus and demonstration farm under the name North Dakota Agricultural College and Agricultural Experiment Station. With President Horace E. Stockbridge and five faculty members, the university opened for its first collegiate year on September 8, 1891. A total of 30 students were listed in the 1891 Prospectus as being \"matriculated in the Special Course.\" Through its proud history, the campus has gained a strong reputation for outstanding education, research and service. An engaged university, NDSU is recognized as a leader among its peers. Acknowledged nationally, NDSU is among 108 institutions listed in the \"Research University/Very High Research\" category by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education. The Land-Grant Heritage Honoring the commitment of the Morrill Act of 1862, the land-grant universities were established to provide studies that were a blend of technical and academic subjects. Known as a \"people's college,\" NDSU was part of the bold experiment to provide access to a college education for the common person. NDSU, the state's first land-grant institution, is well positioned to prepare graduates for the global marketplace and technologically oriented economy. Through a statewide network of centers and electronic technology, NDSU provides a growing capability for delivering education, cultural activities and information to schools and homes throughout North Dakota. NDSU is a publicly supported comprehensive land-grant institution, with a strong agriculture and applied science tradition. The College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies Graduate students were first accepted in 1895, and a formal announcement of graduate studies has been carried in the bulletins since 1902. The Graduate College was formalized July 1, 1954, by approval of the North Dakota Board of Higher Education. Graduate studies were administered by a Graduate Council from November 1949 to June 1954, and before that by a Graduate Committee. The first Master of Science degree was awarded in 1899. Since then, graduate students have been in regular attendance and have participated in the scholarly activity of the campus. The number of degrees awarded increased noticeably after 1920 and again after 1950 in reflection of general trends in higher education in the United States. In 1959, the North Dakota Board of Higher Education first authorized certain departments to offer the Doctor of Philosophy degree. The first Ph.D. degrees were awarded in 1963. NDSU Today NDSU has experienced a remarkable period of growth and expanded academic opportunities, and it is recognized as a national model of the contemporary land-grant institution. NDSU has an enrollment of more than 14,400 students in its undergraduate and graduate programs, and its research expenditures surpass $150 million annually.18 NDSU Overview NDSU is listed at 84 among 402 public universities based on NDSU's research expenditures reported to the National Science Foundation. In addition, NDSU is listed in the National Science Foundation's top 100 in several areas, including: agricultural sciences, social sciences, physical sciences, chemistry, psychology and computer sciences. An institution committed to progress, NDSU continues to advance in all areas because of the energy and dedication of faculty, staff, students, alumni, and friends.

The campus has expanded into downtown Fargo, and is a small city within itself. Statewide, NDSU is located on 19,869.39 acres of North Dakota land, which includes the main Agricultural Experiment Station in Fargo and eight research centers throughout the state. The Fargo-Moorhead Community The home of NDSU, Fargo is a bustling metropolitan area that is often listed as one of the best places to live in the country. Fargo is quietly earning a reputation as a perfect place to make a home. Nestled in the rich farmlands of the Red River Valley, the Fargo-Moorhead community has many qualities that contribute to this reputation, including a highly respected educational system; advanced medical technology; a progressive business community; numerous cultural and arts opportunities; clean air and water; and good-hearted, friendly people. Fargo-Moorhead is among the largest metropolitan centers between Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 230,000 people make their home in Cass and Clay Counties. One of the reasons people choose NDSU as a place to get a good education is that the F-M community provides students access to part- time jobs, internships, parks and other recreational facilities, entertainment, and cultural amenities. Continuing Education Continuing Education is an outreach unit of the university that makes the resources of the institution available in a variety of ways, including distance- based education. Courses, locations, and delivery systems are planned in response to requests and identified needs.North Dakota State University 19 Continuing Education activities fall into three main categories: on- and off-campus credit courses, non-credit activities, and learning opportunities mediated via technology. Admission to NDSU is required to enroll in Continuing Education courses, which are numbered 601 or above.

A 12-week summer session also is offered. Variable-length, short-session courses are available, and meet the same total contact (class) hours as in standard semesters. See definition of an academic credit (p. 31). Mid-Term The mid-term point of a standard semester is approximately 40 class days after the standard semester start. See Examinations and Grading for mid- term grade information. Dead Week Only one exam or quiz per course may be given during the last two weeks of the semester (prorated accordingly for variable length courses), which includes finals week. Exceptions include summer classes, self-paced/correspondence courses, make-up exams, courses in which laboratory is incorporated with a lecture, one-credit courses, and quizzes that account for less than 5% of the students' overall grade. If a professor chooses to give an exam during the last week of classes, he/she is expected to make some instructional use of the final examination time. Final Examinations The schedule for final examinations is determined and published by the Office of Registration and Records. Final examinations (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/336.pdf) in one-credit or variable length short courses are usually given during the last regular class period. Final examinations for all other courses may not be rescheduled during the final examination period. According to State Board of Higher Education policy, the final examination period is instructional time and, if an examination is not given, some instructional use of this period is expected. Final examinations for summer school and distance and continuing education classes are arranged by the instructors. No student shall be obligated to take more than three final examinations scheduled for the same calendar day. In the event that a student has four or more final examinations on the same calendar day, the student shall notify the instructor(s) from the highest numbered course(s) no later than two weeks before the last day of class to schedule a make-up examination to be administered at a mutually acceptable time. Academic Credit Definition of a Credit Hour In accordance with federal guidelines, academic credit hours for a course are determined by the amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes. The NDSU established equivalency for courses bearing academic credit reasonably approximates and is not less than: 1.One semester hour of credit is awarded for 750 minutes of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of 1800 minutes of out-of-class student work; over a fifteen week semester this is equivalent to one 50 minute period of direct instruction and two hours of out-of-class work each week; or 2.At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practicum, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. 3.For laboratories, a minimum of 100 minutes per week for 15 weeks is equivalent to one credit. 4.One semester credit of field experience (courses numbered 196-496; 595-795) requires a minimum of 40 hours of direct experience. Students may earn up to 15 credits per semester with the number of credits to be determined in consultation with the student's academic adviser/department. Cooperative Education credits and limits are determined by the Career Center (https://www.ndsu.edu/career) . 5.For undergraduate research experiences a minimum of 360 minutes per week for 15 weeks is equivalent to 1 credit. 6.For hybrid and online courses, which do not meet the faculty contact requirements, credit is awarded based on the equivalent face-to-face course or by assessing the amount of work required by the student. Academic Honesty and Integrity The primary responsibility of the students, faculty, and administration is to create an atmosphere where the honesty of individuals will not be questioned. Faculty members are responsible for providing guidelines concerning academic honesty and expectations at the beginning of each course. Students are responsible for submitting their own work. Students who cooperate on oral or written examinations or work without authorization share the responsibility for violation of academic principles, and are subject to disciplinary action even when one of the students is not enrolled in the course32 Class Attendance where the violation occurred. Students have the right to be informed when they are suspected of violating academic principles and have the right to a fair opportunity to refute them. Faculty have the prerogative of determining the penalty regarding prohibited academic conduct in their classes. Faculty members may, among other sanctions, fail the student for the particular assignment, test, or course involved. Penalties may be varied with the gravity of the offense and the circumstances of the particular case. In this situation, the student may not drop the course in question without the permission of the instructor. Faculty has the prerogative of determining the penalty regarding prohibited academic conduct in their classes. Faculty members may, among other sanctions, fail the student for the particular assignment, test, or course involved. Penalties may be varied with the gravity of the offense and the circumstances of the particular case. In this situation, the student may not drop the course in question without the permission of the instructor. Faculty members will report the incident to the department chair, dean, and registrar. In the case of the graduate students, the graduate dean also will be notified. In cases of repeat offenses, higher sanctions, up to and including suspension or expulsion may be recommended to the Provost and Committee on Academic Standards. For complete information regarding academic honesty and integrity, student expectations, disciplinary sanctions, appeal procedures, and hearing guidelines, refer to www.ndsu.edu/academichonesty Class Attendance Per the NDSU Policy Manual, Section 333 (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/333.pdf) , the following applies: 1.General Philosophy a.Attendance in classes is expected. Only the course instructor can excuse a student from course responsibilities. (The term course includes class, laboratory, field trips, group exercises, or other credit-bearing activities.) b.If class attendance is a component of the course grade, the course instructor must clearly communicate this to the class in writing in the syllabus. 2.Faculty Responsibility a.The course instructor must clearly inform students on the first day of class and in writing in the syllabus (1) of their policy regarding class absence (including if supporting documentation is required; and (2) policy for making up missed assignments. It is recognized that sometimes an assignment is impossible to make-up. b.The course instructor must exercise a fair and consistent standard for resolving questions of missed assignments, the type, extent, manner, and time frame of the make-up assignments. 3.Student Responsibility a.Students are responsible for informing course instructors of absences. If absences are known (e.g., university sanctioned activity, such as student government, judging, clubs, athletic competition, fine arts performances), course instructors shall be informed with written notification as far in advance as possible (preferably a two-week notice). Where advance notification is not possible (e.g., illness, family emergency), students should contact their course instructor as soon as possible about the absence. Veterans and student service members with special circumstances or who are activated, to include State Active Duty, are encouraged to notify the instructor as soon as possible, provide Activation Orders if possible, and inform the NDSU Military and Veterans Certification (https://www.ndsu.edu/veterans) staff to facilitate a smooth exit from and successful re-entry to the University. b.When a student misses class for any reason, the student is responsible for contacting the instructor to make arrangements to follow the course instructor's policy in making up any missed assignments, if permitted. NOTE: Students are responsible for all registration activity and must follow published dates and deadlines (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/dates) . Non- attendance does not absolve students from course responsibilities and does not automatically remove courses from a student's academic record. Co-Curricular Activities Student participation in co-curricular activities at NDSU is encouraged as an important aspect of college life and is viewed as helping fulfill social and general education needs as well as developing leadership ability. Students who are on academic or conduct probation may participate as members in campus co-curricular activities unless higher standards are set by the specific campus organization. Students in Leadership Positions Students holding elected or appointed leadership positions must meet the following academic and good conduct eligibility standards: 1.Students in leadership positions must have attained and must maintain during the term of participation a minimal cumulative grade average of 2.0. 2.Students in leadership positions must be enrolled for and maintain a minimum of nine (9) semester credits during the term of participation and have successfully completed nine (9) credits from the most previous semester. 3.Students in leadership positions must be in good conduct standing with the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs.North Dakota State University 33 Additional information on the eligibility for participation in co-curricular activities can be found on the Student Life (https://www.ndsu.edu/student_life/ policies_and_forms/eligibility_for_participation_in_co_curricular_activities) website. Commencement Commencement exercises are held at the close of fall and spring semesters. Students who complete graduation requirements during the summer are eligible to participate in either May or December commencement ceremonies within the calendar year of their graduation. To participate in the May commencement exercises, students must be registered in the remaining graduation requirements for the summer session of the same year. A student may participate in commencement only once for a particular degree. The date of degree conferral will be printed on the academic transcript and diploma according to the academic calendar of the university. Reservations for commencement must be made by the date specified by the Office of Registration and Records. Orders for caps, gowns, and hoods are made by the date specified by the NDSU Bookstore (http://www.ndsubookstore.com) . Commencement information is available at www.ndsu.edu/ commencement. Degree Types and Diploma Information Degrees Awarded at NDSU A degree is the title of the credential that the university confers on a graduate who has completed university requirements for graduation. Most undergraduate degree recipients at NDSU earn a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree, however, many programs of study result in a specialized degree. Students may also pursue a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree, if available for their selected major, by completing the Bachelor of Arts Requirements Using a Second Language (p. 64) and/or requirements as specified by their academic college on the program curriculum guide. NDSU confers the following degrees at the undergraduate level: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (B.L.A.) Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.)

Master of Transportation & Urban Systems (M.T.U.S.) Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.) Doctor of Nursing Practice (D.N.P.) Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) Degree Posting Students must declare their intent to graduate, identifying all programs of study, with the Office of Registration and Records or the Graduate College. Degrees are posted to academic records three times per academic year - at the close of each term. Conferral date is the last day of finals week/ the last instructional day of the term. Degrees are posted to the academic record approximately three weeks following the close of the semester in which degree requirements were successfully completed. Diplomas Diplomas are mailed approximately five weeks following the close of the academic term in which graduation requirements have been completed. Neither diplomas nor official transcripts will be released for students who have outstanding debts owed to the university or who have select other holds. Students are responsible for submitting name and address updates for diploma processing. Should a diploma be returned for an insufficient address, the Office of Registration and Records makes every attempt to obtain an updated address. When an updated address is not available, it is held in the Office of Registration and Records for one year, after which time a student will request a diploma replacement. A diploma replacement (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/records/diplomas) service is provided by the Office of Registration and Records for those who have lost or damaged their original diploma. Grades and Grading Grades and Honor Points NDSU has three grading periods per academic year: fall semester, spring semester, and summer session. The quality of student work and achievement of learning outcomes is indicated by a letter grade. In computing scholastic averages, each letter grade is assigned a specific number of honor points for each credit earned. Student work is reported in terms of grade-point average for the term and institutional grade-point average for the composite of work at NDSU. Calculations are based on the following: Grade Descriptions Passing Grades Honor Points Per Credit A Excellent 4.0 B Good 3.0 C Average 2.0 D Passing 1.0 P Pass (D or better) - undergraduate * S Satisfactory (C or better) - graduate * W Withdrew * AU Audit * Non-passing Grades Honor Points Per Credit F Failure 0.0 I Incomplete * U Unsatisfactory *North Dakota State University 35 *Not calculated in grade-point average, but may be calculated in attempted credits for satisfactory academic progress (http://www.ndsu.edu/ bisonconnection/finaid/sap) (SAP) used for financial aid eligibility. Grade Point Average (GPA) Calculation Semester (or term) GPA refers to the grade-point average for any given grading period. Cumulative or institutional GPA refers to the composite grade- point average for all courses and grading periods completed at NDSU. Institutional cumulative grade-point average is calculated by dividing the total number of honor points earned at NDSU by the total number of credit hours in which honor points were recorded, including grades of 'F'. NDSU GPA calculations do not include developmental coursework, which does not count toward the graduation requirements. Coursework/grades accepted in transfer by NDSU are not included in the institutional cumulative GPA, and are not used in calculations for determining academic standing with the University. Refer also to Pass/Fail Grading and Repeated Courses. Pass-Fail Grading Pass-fail grading is available in any given course; however, the pass/fail option may not be used for courses taken to meet general education requirements, unless the course is only offered pass/fail. Students are advised to check degree-program restrictions regarding acceptance of pass/fail credits. Pass/Fail Option Request forms (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms/passfail) may be acquired online. Forms must be signed by the student's adviser. Pass/fail policies include the following: 1.Students are limited to a total of 16 credits under the pass/fail grading option. Courses that are offered only for pass/fail grading for all students who enroll are not included in the 16-credit limitation. 2.Approval for the pass/fail option must be filed in the Office of Registration and Records by the published pass/fail deadline of the semester (https:// www.ndsu.edu/registrar/dates) . Variable length and summer courses have prorated deadlines according to actual course length. Contact the Office of Registration and Records for specific information regarding variable length and summer course deadlines. 3.Once a pass/fail request has been approved and filed, it may not be changed back to a regular grade. 4.A grade of 'P' is without honor points and is not included in the grade-point computation; however, a grade of 'F' is included in the grade-point computation. 5.If a course is taken for a regular grade, it cannot be repeated on a pass/fail basis. Course Failures A failing (F) grade may not be removed by special examination or transfer credit. When a failing grade has been assigned, credit for that course may be earned only by re-enrolling in it at NDSU, or via Tri-College, and completing the course satisfactorily. As with all repeated courses, the original grade will remain on the academic record, but only the latest attempt will be computed in grade-point average calculations (see Repeated Courses (p. 40)). Mid-Term Grading As an early intervention effort to improve retention and academic progress of students, faculty are encouraged to enter deficient mid-term grades of D and F, at minimum, in undergraduate courses. Notifications are sent to students with reported deficient mid-term grades and to academic departments/ advisers. For all courses, mid-term progress reports shall be made available to students upon request. Mid-term grades are not considered official grades and do not appear on student academic transcripts. Adviser holds may be placed on students who have one or more reported deficient mid-term grades. Final Grades Grades for all students in all degree-eligible courses are entered by the grade loading deadline each term so that important end-of-term academic and financial processes may run, and ensure timely notifications may be sent to students. Final grades entered into Campus Connection by instructors are posted to student records approximately three business days after the close of final examination week. Grade Changes With the exception of Incomplete grades, a course grade issued by an instructor and recorded on an academic record is considered final. For the student who has reason to believe the grade issued is incorrect, the student must initiate a request for a change of a grade with the instructor within fifteen (15) instructional days of the first day of the semester immediately following the semester in which the grade was assigned. For Spring Semester courses, the request may be made within fifteen (15) instructional days of the start of Fall Semester, if the student is not enrolled for a summer term. If deemed appropriate, the instructor may submit a change of grade to the Office of Registration and Records via a Grade Reporting Form . Grade changes may only be considered for students who have not yet earned a degree. Grade Appeals If resolution is not reached through a standard grade change inquiry, a student may pursue a grade appeal. The Grade Change Appeals Board may be utilized only after the student has exhausted possible appeal routes within the college offering the course. A grade appeal is deemed formally initiated when the student presents the Grade Appeal Form (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/registrar/forms/gradeappeal.pdf) to the instructor. If there is an36 Grades of Incomplete unsatisfactory decision, the student must consult the department head/chair, and the dean or a designated college committee, proceeding from one level to the next only after an unsatisfactory decision of the conflict at that level. In the event that the instructor is also the department head or dean, he or she need only be consulted in the capacity of instructor. In the event of an unsatisfactory decision within the college, the student may submit the formal written appeal to the Grade Appeals Board Chair. Such an appeal shall be made within fifteen (15) instructional days after conclusion of the college proceedings as stated above. The full Grade Appeals policy (section 337) (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/337.pdf) , which includes hearing procedures, is available on the NDSU Policy (https://www.ndsu.edu/policy) web site. Grade appeals only may be considered for students who have not yet earned a degree. If a student is in their final semester of enrollment pending a degree completion, the student has fifteen (15) instructional days to initiate a grade request. Grades of Incomplete Under extraordinary circumstances and at the discretion of the instructor, a student may be assigned a grade of Incomplete (I). The following policies apply to Incomplete grades: 1.The grade of Incomplete is assigned to indicate that satisfactory work has been completed up to within five weeks of the semester end, and that circumstances beyond the student's control prevented completion of the work. The time period is proportional for variable length courses and summer session. 2.The grade of Incomplete is not to be given in any instance where the student has a deficiency of more than five weeks (or equivalent) of work including final exam week. 3.Grades of Incomplete are initiated by student request. The student must contact the instructor, request an Incomplete grade, and, upon instructor approval, make arrangements to complete the work. 4.The grade of Incomplete (I) is an administrative grade that may only be entered by the Office of Registration and Records, except in courses designated as practicum, internship, individual study, field experience, or study abroad. 5.An Incomplete Grade Reporting Form detailing the work to be completed, expected completion date, and grading standard is to be signed and dated by both the instructor and the student. The form is to be submitted to the Office of Registration and Records by the grade submission deadline for the semester in which the course was taken. It is advisable that the instructor, student and adviser retain copies of this form for their records. 6.Grades of Incomplete, including those for most course types identified in #4, must be removed no later than the end of the seventh week of the next full semester (fall or spring). The time period is proportional for variable length courses and summer session. 7.Grades of Incomplete are removed when the student has completed all course requirements and the instructor of the course files a Grade Reporting Form with the Office of Registration and Records. 8.All grades of Incomplete that are not removed within the specified time are automatically changed to 'F' grades by the Office of Registration and Records. 9.Instructors may specify completion deadlines for remaining work on the Incomplete Grade Reporting Form earlier than the standard deadlines. 10.Requests for extensions beyond the seventh week of the next full semester require approval by both the instructor and the chair of the department offering the course. The extended deadline must be indicated on the Incomplete Grade Reporting Form and may not exceed two Incomplete conversion/deadline cycles. If a grade is not submitted by the specified deadline, the Incomplete grade will convert to a grade of 'F'. 11.Grades of Incomplete, which convert to grades of 'F', earned in the last semester of attendance by a student who leaves the university for two or more years may be changed to Withdrawn ('W') upon re-enrollment. Requests for this privilege must be filed with the Office of Registration and Records during the first term of re-entry. 12.An Incomplete grade may be converted to a letter grade (or P/F, S/U) according to the above guidelines, but may not be expunged from the record. 13.Students may not register in courses in which they currently hold grades of Incomplete, except for courses that are repeatable for credit. 14.Students are not allowed to graduate with Incomplete grades on their academic records. Upon graduation, unconverted Incomplete grades will convert to grades of 'F'. If a course in which an Incomplete grade was assigned is required for graduation, the instructor may extend the deadline according to the above procedures and timelines, and graduation will be postponed. 15.Students who receive grades of Incomplete or converted grades of F may appeal disputed grades in accordance with NDSU Policy, Section 337: Grade Appeals Board (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/337.pdf) . Project 65 People aged 65 or over may audit one course per semester free of tuition and related fees, with the exception of a one-time $35 application fee. Courses not eligible for Project 65 include those not covered by the tuition cap. Contact Registration and Records for questions regarding course eligibility. Project 65 students are encouraged to purchase the textbooks for their courses. The transcript of a student auditing a course will show a grade of 'Audit' for the course, which will not count as credit toward a degree. By definition, an auditor may attend class only as a listener. Students wishing to earn credit toward a degree must be admitted and pay all tuition and fees and complete all assignments and tests. Students are responsible for course selection and need to obtain a class permit from the academic department of the course the student would like to enroll in. The instructor/department staff will issue the permit with the audit authorization. Students should bring the permit and identify themselvesNorth Dakota State University 37 as participants in the Project 65 program at the time of registration to the Office of Registration and Records (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar) , 110 Ceres (701-231-7981 ). Registration Students must be properly admitted and fully enrolled to attend classes. Students ultimately are responsible for all course registration activity and they are expected to monitor their schedule of classes and drop courses that they do not intend to complete by the published deadlines. Dates and deadlines for advising and registration are made available in the Academic Dates and Deadlines Calendar (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/dates) posted online. Students are encouraged to visit with an academic adviser before registering for classes (see Academic Advising (p. 42)). Schedule of Classes: The most current and complete listing of classes is made available on Campus Connection, NDSU's official student information system, approximately one month prior to the start of registration for a subsequent term. A course listing (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/academics/ schedule) is also available online. Online Registration: Enrolled students may register online via Campus Connection (https://studentadmin.connectnd.us/psp/NDCSPRD/EMPLOYEE/ HRMS/h/?tab=GUEST) , NDSU's student information system. Registration instructions (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/registration) are posted online. On-site Registration: On-site registration is provided for new students and for those who are unable to or who choose not to register online. Summer Registration: Registration for summer session occurs during the previous spring at the same time as registration for fall semester. For registration purposes, students are grouped into the following three general categories: Currently enrolled students: Currently enrolled students or those who had registration in a prior standard semester (fall or spring) are assigned registration appointment times according to total credits earned. Registration appointments may be viewed on Campus Connection. Returning students: Returning students are those who have previously attended NDSU, but who have not been in attendance for at least one full semester (fall or spring). Returning students are assigned registration appointment times according to total credits earned after the Reactivation/ Petition for Readmission is received and processed in the Office of Registration and Records. Registration appointment times may be viewed on Campus Connection. New students: Detailed information regarding orientation and registration options is sent to all new students from Student Success Programs (https://www.ndsu.edu/studentsuccess) . Incoming freshmen, including first year students with transfer credit, are expected to attend a new student orientation and registration session. Admitted transfer students may register on Campus Connection along with NDSU students, or may attend a transfer orientation and registration program. Transfer student registration appointment times are based on the total number of credits accepted in transfer to NDSU. Instructor Drop Procedure Instructors or departments have the option to administratively drop students who have not attended the first week (and in some cases, the first meeting) of a lecture or laboratory, or who do not meet all course requisites. Administrative course drop requests made by instructors/departments should be submitted to the Office of Registration and Records within the first week of a class meeting for processing. Students are responsible for all course registration activity and should drop courses that they do not intend to complete. Students should not rely on instructors or departments administratively dropping them. Student failure to drop courses by posted deadlines will result in failing grades and debt owed the university. Financial Obligation Agreement The North Dakota University System Financial Obligation Agreement (https://www.ndsu.edu/bisonconnection/accounts/ financial_obligation_agreement_foa) (FOA) is used to verify that a student has acknowledged their financial responsibility to the University when they register for courses. Students must access, review and accept the FOA prior to registration for each term of enrollment in Campus Connection. Changes in Registration Registration deadlines for standard fall and spring semester courses are posted in the online Dates and Deadlines calendar (https://www.ndsu.edu/ registrar/dates) . Deadlines for variable length and summer session courses are adjusted proportionately and are also available online. Students are responsible for making changes to their registration according to published procedures and deadlines. Adding Courses/Sections Students may add courses to their schedules via Campus Connection until the published deadline to add online. After the deadline to add online, an authorized \"Class Permit\" for each course to be added must be acquired from the department offering the course and submitted to the Office of Registration and Records (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar) or NDSU One Stop (https://www.ndsu.edu/bisonconnection) . Enrollment Add Deadline All undergraduate and graduate students are expected to have added their courses via Campus Connection one week from the start of the semester. After one week, departments/instructors must provide student(s) with a course permit to add course(s). Class permits are accepted through the fourth38 Registration week of a semester. Full semester course additions will not be processed after fourth week enrollment census, unless approved by the Graduate School Dean or the Registrar, as well as approval by the Provost's Office. Contact the Office of Registration and Records for course add deadline (https:// www.ndsu.edu/registrar/dates/course_add_deadline) information. Dropping Courses/Sections No-record drops: Students may drop a course from their schedule without it appearing on their academic record until the published No Record Drop deadline for standard and variable length courses. Record (W) drops: Students may continue to drop courses after the no-record drop period until the published Drop deadline for standard and variable length courses. However, such drops will be recorded on student transcripts with 'W'. These indicators do not affect grade-point averages, but are counted in attempted credits for financial aid satisfactory academic progress (https://www.ndsu.edu/bisonconnection/finaid/sap) . Auditing Courses An auditor may attend classes only as a listener, without participation in regular class exercises, and may be admitted to classes only with a class permit and official registration as an auditor. No credit is received for audited courses, and 'AU' appears on the transcript. A student cannot fail an audit; however, an instructor may assign a 'WAU' (withdrawn) for non-attendance. A student may drop a regularly registered course and add it as an audit course by submitting a Class Permit by the published deadline. Once the audit registration is processed, the decision cannot be reversed. An audit fee is one-half of the regular tuition rate, and may be included in the tuition cap. Wait Listed Classes NDSU utilizes a wait list feature in Campus Connection for most classes. Students attempting to register for a class that has reached its enrollment capacity may add themselves to a wait list. Wait list processes run daily until the No Record Drop deadline for a class. Students should monitor their position on a wait list and may be automatically enrolled if a seat becomes available and no holds or course restrictions prevent enrollment. Students are notified via official NDSU email if enrolled in a class via the wait list process, but are ultimately responsible for any registration activity. Students no longer wishing to be enrolled in a wait listed class must drop it from their study list on Campus Connection. Students wishing to enroll in a class that does not utilize the wait list process should contact the academic department offering the course for options. Cancellation of Registration Students who register and then decide not to attend NDSU before the semester start date must cancel their registration by submitting a Cancellation of Registration/Withdraw to Zero Credits form. Forms must be submitted to NDSU One Stop. Cancellations are not accepted by telephone, and it is not possible to cancel registration or to drop an only or last course online. Cancellations completed prior to the semester start date result in a full refund and no academic transcript. Withdrawal to Zero Credits Students who have registered and then wish to drop all courses after the semester start date must officially withdraw from the university. Failure to initiate the withdrawal process may result in 'F' grades and financial obligations that otherwise might be avoided. Refer to the section on financial information (http://www.ndsu.edu/bisonconnection/accounts/refunds/#c166637) for prorated refund deadlines for withdrawals. Steps to withdraw from all courses include the following: 1.Read and complete the Cancellation of Registration/Withdraw to Zero Credits Form (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms/withdraw) . Submit to NDSU One Stop. 2.Students are responsible for any unpaid bills at the time of withdrawal. 3.Withdrawal forms must be submitted by the published deadline of the semester. Withdrawals after this date will not be processed without evidence of a compelling reason or circumstance beyond the student's control. Courses already completed at the time of withdrawal from a term will be withdrawn as well. 4.Students should not attempt to drop all of their courses, their last course, or their only course on Campus Connection. 5.Unlike refunds for individual course drops, withdrawal refunds (https://www.ndsu.edu/onestop/accounts/dropping_withdrawing) are prorated and are based on complete withdrawals from all courses, course lengths, and withdrawal dates. 6.Contact the Counseling Center (https://www.ndsu.edu/counseling) or Disability Services (https://www.ndsu.edu/disabilityservices) if assistance is needed in addressing academic, personal, financial, or other concerns. Retroactive Withdrawals Students seeking to withdraw after final grades have been posted may appeal for a retroactive withdrawal; selective course drops are not allowed. Appeals must include documented evidence of a circumstance beyond the student's control which prevented the student from withdrawing on or before the published deadline for the term. The formal appeal request must be submitted prior to three years after the term of the last date of attendance at NDSU.North Dakota State University 39 Dual Career/Level Registration Students are permitted to register for classes according to their classification level with the university. 1.Graduate students who wish to enroll in undergraduate coursework must follow the procedure below that most closely matches their academic intent: If undergraduate coursework is a prerequisite or condition of admission to a graduate program of study, obtain approval from the Graduate College (https://www.ndsu.edu/gradschool) . This coursework will be billed at the undergraduate rate and will be recorded on an undergraduate academic record. If undergraduate coursework is to be applied to an undergraduate program in which the student plans to enroll concurrent with a graduate program of study, submit either an Undergraduate Application for Admission (https://www.ndsu.edu/admission/admission_information/ application) (if never enrolled as an undergraduate at NDSU) or a Reactivation Form (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms/reactivation) (if previously enrolled as an undergraduate at NDSU). This coursework will appear on an undergraduate academic record and be billed at the undergraduate rate. Graduate tuition waivers may not cover undergraduate coursework. If undergraduate coursework is to be applied to a graduate program of study (select programs only), obtain approval from the Graduate College. This coursework will appear on a graduate academic record and be billed at the graduate rate. 2.Undergraduate students who wish to enroll in graduate coursework must follow the procedure below that most closely matches their academic intent: If graduate coursework is to be applied to a graduate program of study, the student must be admitted to the Graduate College (https:// www.ndsu.edu/gradschool) . This coursework will appear on a graduate academic record and be billed at the graduate rate. If graduate coursework is to be applied to an undergraduate program of study (such as in substitution for a degree requirement), departmental permission is required. This coursework will appear on an undergraduate record and will be charged at the undergraduate rate. Such credit may not be applied to a graduate degree program of study at NDSU. Dual Career Registration forms (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms) and instructions for ensuring that undergraduate and graduate coursework are applied to the appropriate academic career records are available online. A collaborative student is one who chooses to enroll at more than one North Dakota University System (NDUS) institution for a particular term. The institution from which the student is earning a degree is considered the \"home institution \". The institution(s) that supplies courses for a degree is considered the \"provider institution(s) \". The following guidelines pertain to courses taken collaboratively: 1.A student must be enrolled in at least one degree credit course at NDSU before enrolling in a collaborative course including the summer semester. Excluded from this requirement are students using the faculty/staff tuition waiver. 2.Only degree seeking undergraduate students in good academic standing (GPA of 2.0 or higher) are allowed to enroll collaboratively. 3.The collaborative process allows NDSU to combine credit from more than one NDUS institution for the purpose of financial aid (for courses added through the seventh business day from the start of the term). 4.Collaborative courses are not subject to the NDSU tuition cap. 5.The student pays provider campus tuition/fees for collaborative course(s). This additional amount is included in the student's accounts receivable balance at NDSU. 6.Not all scholarships/tuition waivers cover collaborative tuition and fees. Please check with your funding agency. 7.Students must be in good financial standing to be eligible for collaborative coursework registration. 8.The student cannot exceed a total of 20 credits between NDSU and the provider institution(s) without special permission from the Registrar at home and provider campuses. 9.The student must follow NDSU's academic dates and deadlines for adding/dropping collaborative courses. 10.Drop/adds must be administered by submitting an updated collaborative registration form to the home institution. NDSU students may submit the form to the Office of Registration and Records, 110 Ceres Hall. 11.Courses will be posted to the NDSU academic record as transfer credit once NDSU receives an official transcript from the provider institution. Note: Grades earned in collaborative courses may be used in determining financial aid satisfactory progress. 12.A student's last 30 credits of a degree program must be earned in residence at NDSU. Any student taking credits within the last 30 must submit an Appeal for Exception to Academic Regulations (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms/acadappeal) to the Office of Registration and Records. Exempt from this requirement are students in the Elementary Education, Social Work, and Bismarck Nursing programs. 13.Completion of the Collaborative Student Contract and Registration Form (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms/collaborative) does not guarantee registration into the requested course(s). However, if the request(s) cannot be processed, the student will be notified via their NDSU e-mail address. 14.Collaborative registration is not an option for repeating courses previously taken at NDSU. If students wish to take advantage of the repeated course opportunity to improve a grade, that course must be repeated at NDSU. 15.Due to federal compliance, course repeats via collaborative registration will be prohibited to prevent significant federal financial aid impacts which could result in overpayment of federal financial aid funds. The 12-week summer session is designed to provide coursework within various time intervals. Classes typically are offered in either the full 12-week session, a standard four-week session that begins in May, or a standard eight-week session that begins in June. There are many other short or variable40 Repeated Courses length courses throughout the summer. While the time interval of the individual sessions is different than that of the standard semester, each course carries full credit because classes meet the same number of contact hours as in the standard semester. In addition, deadlines for variable length and summer session courses are adjusted proportionately. Students are responsible for making changes to their registration according to published deadlines. Each college or department determines its summer offerings, based upon previous enrollments, programmatic needs, and special requests. Special effort is made to offer courses approved for fulfilling general education requirements. The summer session course offerings schedule (https:// www.ndsu.edu/registrar/academics/schedule) is available online. For information on summer school, please call 231-8492 or 231-6133. Fees and Housing Student, course, and program fees (http://www.ndsu.edu/bisonconnection/accounts/tuition) are available online. Information concerning summer housing may be secured by contacting the Department of Residence Life (https://www.ndsu.edu/reslife) , Dept. ). Graduate Work A range of opportunities is available for graduate work during the summer session as evidenced by the traditionally high enrollment of graduate students. A considerable number of graduate courses are offered, but generally the summer serves as an important term for students to work on their research requirements, especially if field work is involved. Work on disquisitions and individual study arrangements frequently are facilitated during summers. Courses scheduled to begin at different times and for varying periods provide a high level of flexibility. Thus, those who may have only a portion of a given summer available are likely to find courses that meet their scheduling limitations. In addition, workshops, internships, and other special programs are offered. Teachers generally find the summer school designed to offer attractive selections as components of a degree program, as well as courses directed toward improvement of professional skills. Persons interested in graduate programs of study are encouraged to contact the Graduate College (https://www.ndsu.edu/gradschool) for further information. Repeated Courses Students who wish to take advantage of the repeated course opportunity to improve a grade must repeat the course at NDSU, with one exception only. NDSU students may register for a Tri-College course to repeat a course previously taken at NDSU (see Tri-College rules and restrictions (p. 829)). If a course is completed at NDSU and an attempt is made to repeat that course elsewhere, the credit is considered duplicate and is not eligible for transfer. When a course is repeated at NDSU, all attempts remain on the academic record but only the credits, grades, and related honor points for the most recent attempt will be used in calculating the cumulative grade-point average and credits for graduation. Students forfeit the previous grade no matter what grade is earned when the course is repeated. All repeated courses are noted on the transcript to indicate the course was repeated in a following term and previous attempts are excluded from cumulative totals. Courses taken for regular 'A'-'F' grades may not be repeated under the pass-fail grading option. The course repeat option to improve one's academic record is available to students who have not graduated. Repeat attempts made in semesters following a degree posting will remain on the academic record along with the new grade, but will be excluded from GPA and credit calculations. Student Credit Load The recommended credit load for undergraduate students is 15-18 hours per semester during a standard academic term (fall/spring). Undergraduate and professional student full time status is 12 or more credits per semester (9 credits in the summer). Half time is 6 credits per semester (5 credits in the summer). Students are limited to 20 credits per semester (15 credits in the summer). Students who find it necessary to exceed this credit limit must have an NDSU minimum institutional grade-point average of 3.0 to be eligible to petition for an overload. The Over 20 Credits Petition Form (https://www.ndsu.edu/ fileadmin/registrar/forms/overtwenty.pdf) is available online. Graduate student full time status is 9 or more credits per semester (6 credits in the summer). Half time is 5 credits per semester (3 credits in the summer). Graduate students may enroll in up to 15 credits per semester and must obtain approval from the Graduate College (https://www.ndsu.edu/ gradschool) to exceed this maximum. Student Records Transcripts Official transcripts may be requested online through Campus Connection (https://studentadmin.connectnd.us/psp/NDCSPRD/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/ h/?tab=GUEST) (current students) (Self Service>Academic Records>Official Transcript Request) or through www.getmytranscript.com (http:// www.getmytranscript.com) (former students). Online ordering provides 24/7 access and additional tracking information. According to federal law,North Dakota State University 41 telephone requests and requests from others on behalf of the student cannot be honored. There is a charge for an official transcript. See Official Transcript Requests (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/records/transcripts) for detailed transcript fee information. An official transcript request by a student who is in debt to the university will not be honored until the indebtedness has been paid. The transcript only includes detailed work completed at NDSU. Requests for transcripts of work completed elsewhere must be made directly with the respective institution. Current students may obtain unofficial transcripts (https://www.ndsu.edu/bisonconnection/connect/unofficial) , any time, free of charge, on Campus Connection. Correction of Transcript Errors If a student believes there is an error in the recording of a course grade on the transcript, the student should first contact the instructor to verify the grade. Other transcript questions or concerns should be directed to the Office of Registration and Records (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar) . See also the sections on Grade Changes and Appeals.

Attention to such details as semester credit loads and course sequences are recommended for optimum experiences. Academic Advising The academic advising program at NDSU is designed to facilitate the student's intellectual and personal growth, to assist students in using university resources, and to guide students in making informed choices regarding academic and career plans. Following admission to NDSU, each student is assigned an adviser from the college or department in which the student is majoring. If a major has not been declared, an assignment is made with an adviser in the Advising Resource Center (https://www.ndsu.edu/advising_resource_center) . Advisers assist students in selecting courses to ensure a balanced education and they help interpret university and college policies and requirements. However, students are responsible for their academic decisions including the selection of courses, meeting course requisites (co-requisites/prerequisites), and adhering to policies, procedures, and deadlines. Students are encouraged to see their adviser prior to registration. Students with adviser holds are required to meet with their advisers before the hold is lifted. Adviser assignments and holds can be viewed on Campus Connection. At any time, students and their advisers may track their degree progress using the Academic Requirements Report (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/ academics/advising/advisement) (degree audit) feature on Campus Connection. This functionality is interactive and allows students to plan and track their degree progress. Instructions and information on how to access and utilize these reports are available to both students and advisers. Advisers also assist students with campus resources, referrals, career planning, and campus policies and procedures. NDSU delivers services to support student academics and meet special needs. Refer to the Advising Resource Center for additional information and services. Each of the academic colleges has a College Liaison (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/office/liaisons) within the Office of Registration and Records who serves as a central point of contact to support and facilitate academic advising activities for faculty and professional advisers working with undergraduate (including pharmacy programs) student degree progress. Credit By Examination Students may demonstrate evidence of college-level achievement through the use of nationally standardized tests. Competency to write these examinations may have been gained through intensive preparation in high school, extensive reading in a particular field, or other types of formal or informal preparation. A student may not repeat by proficiency testing a course that has been previously taken or failed at NDSU or another accredited institution. Score reports must be sent directly to NDSU from the awarding agency/board. High school transcripts and student-issued grade reports are not considered official for purposes of awarding credit by examination. Credit by examination is not considered NDSU residential credit. Advanced Placement Examination (AP) Students from high schools that participate in the Advanced Placement Program may earn credit through examinations provided by the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB). The examinations are administered at the conclusion of a college-level course taught in participating high schools. AP Score Reports are sent to the colleges or universities designated on your exam answer sheet. Students who do not designate NDSU on their answer sheet may contact AP Services (see below) to have scores sent to NDSU. The code for NDSU is 6474. In accordance with North Dakota University System policy, a minimum score of three is required to receive credit for Advanced Placement (AP) examinations. If NDSU does not have an equivalent course, free elective credit may be awarded. Credit earned through AP is not residence credit and may not be used to satisfy residence-credit requirements for graduation.

DSST Examinations NDSU recognizes the DSST (Dantes) examination, which was originally designed for the military as a way to provide individuals an opportunity to obtain college level credit for what they have learned in nontraditional ways. Now available for civilian use, the DSST Test Control Officer (TCO) administers46 Credit By Examination the exams on more than 560 military installations and official DSST test centers. The main users of the exams include adult education programs, U.S. Department of Defense, and two- and four-year colleges and universities. NDSU's DSST location site code is: DSST-9366. In accordance with North Dakota University System policy, students must receive a minimum score on the examinations to qualify for possible awarding of credit and advanced placement, which is determined by the appropriate academic department on campus. If NDSU does not have an equivalent course, free elective credit may be awarded. Credit earned through DSST may not be used to satisfy residence-credit requirements for graduation.

A course challenge is only permitted for courses in which the student has no previous record (prior registrations allowable if course was dropped by the No Record Drop deadline in a given term). Further, credits earned by course challenge may not satisfy requirements toward a graduate degree. Procedures for pursuing a course challenge include the following 1.Obtain a Petition for Course Challenge Form (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms/challenge) , available online. 2.Obtain approval from the academic adviser, the instructor of the course, and the chair of the department offering the course. Clarify expectations of the challenge, e.g., examination only or examination plus other performance. Based on the nature of the course and content area, some courses may not be approved for challenge by the department. 3.Pay the course challenge fee at the Customer Account Services (https://www.ndsu.edu/bisonconnection/accounts) , 302 Ceres Hall, after receiving approval for the challenge (50% of the regular credit tuition charge; not subject to tuition cap). 4.Arrange a mutually convenient date and time for the challenge with the instructor or department. 5.Upon receipt of the signed Petition for Course Challenge form from the department, courses and credits successfully challenged are listed on the student's academic transcript with a passing (P) grade. Unsuccessful challenges are not recorded. Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Eligibility: Secondary school students successfully completing Project Lead the Way (PLTW) courses may apply for transcripted college credit from North Dakota State University. The student will receive 3 semester credits per course, subject to the following conditions: The high school must be certified by PLTW. All requirements for the PLTW course must be satisfied, and the student must achieve an average of 85% or better for the course The PLTW End of Course Assessment must be taken and passed with a stanine* score of 6. Correct payment amount and completed application must be post marked by the deadline. Any application post marked after the deadline will not be processed and will be returned. *This assessment (Administered by PLTW) is based on a norm-reference stanine scores which ranges from one (1) to nine (9) with one (1) being the lowest possible score and nine (9) being the highest possible score. NDSU will accept transcripted credit for PLTW courses from other affiliate universities with equivalent credit requirements. Up to 6 credits may be used as general electives towards a degree at the NDSU. Possible substitution of PLTW credits for meeting specific programmatic requirements at the University is at the discretion of the individual academic programs. Currently, at NDSU, PLTW courses do not have specific program equivalents.North Dakota State University 49 The PLTW courses for which NDSU credit may be received are the following: ENGR: 120 PLTW IED: Introduction to Engineering Design POE: of Engineering Digital Electronics ENGR: 123 PLTW CEA: of Civil Engineering and Architecture ENGR: 124 PLTW ES: Biotechnical Engineering or Environmental Engineering ENGR: PLTW CIM: Computer Integrated Manufacturing Aerospace ENGR: 127 Design and Development ENGR: 128 PLTW CSE: Computer Science and Software Engineering Once approved students see a Pass (P) appear on the NDSU transcript.

English and Math Placement In accordance with North Dakota University System Policy and Procedure 402.1.2 (http://www.ndus.nodak.edu/makers/procedures/sbhe/default.asp? PID=217&SID=5) students are placed into Mathematics and English courses based on qualifying exam scores. The intent is to appropriately place students into courses that are both challenging and for which they are adequately prepared. The following criteria are used to determine placement of students who have been offered admission to NDSU into entry-level English courses. Students, whether from the United States, Canada or abroad, have the option to take the Accuplacer English exam to determine placement or to attempt to place into a higher level English course. English Placement for U.S. Students, Canadian Students, and U.S. Permanent Residents All students are required to successfully earn credit for ENGL 110 and 120 or equivalent as part of the NDSU general education requirements. Eligible students with disabilities may seek reasonable accommodations to take the placement test. Please submit disability documentation to NDSU Disability Services at least two weeks prior to the time in which the accommodations are needed. Documentation will be reviewed and students will be notified if additional documentation is needed to make an eligibility decision. Please submit the request and documentation to: NDSU Disability Services (https://www.ndsu.edu/disabilityservices) ; Fargo, ND 58108-6050; (701) 231-8463. Students who have not taken the ACT or SAT are eligible to enroll in a developmental English course, ASC 087, prior to enrolling in ENGL 110. ASC 087 will be delivered by North Dakota State College of Science (http://www.ndscs.edu) (NDSCS) on the NDSU campus. Students must register through the collaborative student registration (p. 39) process. Course textbooks for ASC 087 may be purchased through the NDSU bookstore (http://www.ndsubookstore.com) . For students who have multiple exam scores, the highest placement may be used. Students who are required to begin in ASC 087 must successfully complete the course with a grade of 'S' (satisfactory) before they may enroll in ENGL 110 or equivalent. Students with an ACT English sub-test score of 18 or higher (or SAT of 480 or higher) are advised to enroll in ENGL 120. Upon completion of ENGL 120 with a 'C' grade or higher, students will be awarded placement credit (4) for ENGL 110. Students with an ACCUPLACER WritePlacer score of 5 are advised to enroll in English 110.

The following guidelines apply to math placement practices: For students who have scores from multiple tests, the highest placement may be used. Eligible students with disabilities may seek reasonable accommodations to take the placement test. Please submit disability documentation to NDSU Disability Services at least two weeks prior to the time in which the accommodations are needed. Documentation will be reviewed and students will be notified if additional documentation is needed to make an eligibility decision. Please submit the request and documentation to: NDSU Disability Services (https://www.ndsu.edu/disabilityservices) ; ND 58108-6050; (701) 231-8463. Current, incoming or returning NDSU students who do not have prior college-level mathematics OR a Math ACT sub-test score (or SAT score) must take the Pearson test to determine course placement. Students from countries other than the United States and Canada who do not have prior college-level mathematics OR a Math ACT sub-test score (or SAT score) must take the Pearson test OR the NDSU Math Placement Test to determine course placement. Students with a Math ACT sub-test score of at least 21 (or SAT 530) may elect to take the NDSU Math Placement Test to attempt to place into a course above MATH 103 or MATH 104. Students with a Math ACT sub-test score of 20 or lower may elect to take the Pearson test to attempt to place into a course above MATH 98. Students with a ACCUPLACER Elementary Algebra score of 76 or an ACCUPLACER College Level Math score of 50 may enroll into MATH 103. Questions about the NDSU Math Placement Test can be directed to NDSU One Stop (https://www.ndsu.edu/bisonconnection) .

The program is designed so that students will be able to adapt to and anticipate changes in their profession and in society. Students also will be able to integrate and use the knowledge and perspectives they have gained to live productive, intellectually rewarding and meaningful lives. General Education Category Descriptions The following descriptions are elaborations of the general education categories approved by the Faculty Senate. Communication (C) is the clear, precise, and purposeful exchange of information in a variety of contexts, using either written or oral means. Cultural diversity (D) focuses on the social, personal, and interpersonal effects of variety and differences among cultures. Fine arts (A) , as an integral component of the humanities, promote the appreciation of aesthetics and the expression of creativity. Global perspectives (G) focus on analysis of worldwide issues illustrating the interdependence of the world and its people. Humanities (A) systematically explore cultural and intellectual forces shaping events, individual expression, and social values. Quantitative reasoning (R) is an organized set of quantitative methods used to solve problems or extend knowledge. Quantitative methods are a set of principles and procedures that could be used to manipulate numerical data. Science (S) is an organized body of knowledge, including principles and procedures based on scientific methods, used to explain physical or biological phenomena. Social and behavioral sciences (B) use scientific methods to analyze the behaviors, structures, and processes of individuals and groups. Wellness (W) is a dynamic and integrative process of becoming aware of healthy lifestyles, of learning to make informed choices, and of developing a balanced approach to living. General Education Requirements for Baccalaureate Degree A list of approved general education courses is available here (p. 54). General education courses may be used to satisfy requirements for both general education and the major, minor, and program emphases, where applicable. Students should carefully review the major, minor, and program emphases requirements for minimum grade restrictions, should they apply.52 General Education Code Title Credits Communication (C) 12 ENGL 110 College Composition I ENGL 120 College Composition II COMM 110 Fundamentals of Public Speaking Upper Division Writing Quantitative Reasoning (R) 3 Science and Technology (S) 10 Humanities and Fine Arts (A) 6 Social and Behavioral Sciences (B) 6 Wellness (W) 2 Cultural Diversity (D) * Global Perspectives (G) * Total Credits 39 * May be satisfied by completing courses in another General Education category. May be satisfied with courses required in the major. Review major requirements to determine if a specific upper division writing course is required. General Education Program Assessment General education assessment has three basic purposes: 1.To improve student learning and development by identifying the intended student outcomes for the program. 2.To provide feedback on the progress toward the intended student outcomes. 3.To use the feedback to modify aspects of the program to ensure that the outcomes are being achieved and that student learning is improved. Assessment activities are valued at NDSU and include the participation of students. Results will not be used to penalize students or faculty. Student performance on assessment of the general education program will not become part of the transcript. General Education Transfer Students transferring lower-division general education credits within the North Dakota University System need to consult with advisers in their academic programs at NDSU for two reasons. First, degree requirements of individual programs and colleges at NDSU may exceed the university-wide general education requirements. Second, meeting the university-wide lower-division general education requirements by transfer credits may not necessarily prepare students for advanced, upper-division study in an academic major at NDSU. See also the NDUS GERTA Agreement. Using NDSU Study Abroad and Study Tour Experiences for General Education Cultural Diversity or Global Perspectives UNIV 492: Study Abroad - A student who studies abroad for one or more semesters and who successfully completes a minimum of three credits may qualify for either Cultural Diversity or Global Perspectives. Six or more study abroad credits may qualify for both Cultural Diversity and Global Perspectives categories. A student must arrange to have an official transcript sent to NDSU from the study abroad institution for official evaluation and credit determination. In addition, a student must complete a Student Appeal for Exception to General Education Requirements (https://www.ndsu.edu/ fileadmin/registrar/forms/genedappeal.pdf) for consideration. (Prefix) 379: Study Tour - Study Tour experiences do not automatically qualify for NDSU general education. An NDSU study tour instructor must apply for general education course approval in the appropriate category that pertains to the course content (including cultural diversity and global perspectives). Approval requires the instructor to submit a course syllabus and a one-page rationale addressing how the tour experience will meet the outcome being sought. Syllabus and rationale are to be submitted to the University Curriculum Committee well in advance of the tour departure. Core Undergraduate Learning Outcomes The intended learning outcomes resulting from the various general education categories include the following: Communication (C) 1.Communication Learning Outcome - students will use a variety of modes, particularly written, oral, artistic, and visual to a.effectively communicate analysis, knowledge, understanding, expression and/or conclusions b.skillfully use high-quality, credible, relevant sources c.demonstrate appropriate conventions in a variety of communication situationsNorth Dakota State University 53 d.demonstrate the ability to communicate effectively with diverse audiences in a variety of contexts Quantitative Reasoning (R) 1.Critical Thinking, Creative Thinking, and Problem Solving Learning Outcome -

No category credit requirement may be deficient by more than a partial semester credit. However, in the communication category, if the transfer course(s) have been evaluated as equivalent to ENGL 110 College Composition I , ENGL 120 College Composition II , and COMM 110 Fundamentals of Public Speaking and total no less than eight semester credits, the lower-division category requirement has been met. Transfer students meet NDSU's general education \"College Composition I and/or College Composition II\" requirement in the lower-division Communication category if they have credit in any English course (in composition, composition and literature, or the equivalent) totaling at least 2.67 semester credits per course. The total for all general education categories must be at least 39/40 semester credits for new students. 11.Students may receive placement credit for ENGL 110 College Composition I based on a minimum English ACT score (or SAT equivalent) and satisfactory performance (grade of 'C' or better) in ENGL 120 College Composition II or equivalent. 12.A student who has completed a general education program in the United States or Canada consisting of a minimum of 36 semester credits at a regionally accredited institution and who transfers to NDSU or who pursues a second baccalaureate degree at NDSU is considered to have completed his or her lower-division general education requirements at NDSU. Transfer student coursework from outside the United States and Canada will be evaluated on a course-by-course basis. [NOTE: Undergraduate curriculum guides identify courses in the general education section of the guide that typically satisfy both general education and major requirements. These courses must still be satisfied as part of the major requirement and cannot be waived by general education policy #12.] 13.General education courses at other accredited institutions, which do not have equivalent courses or general education status at NDSU, may be accepted in transfer as part of the general education requirements at NDSU. 14.All general education course syllabi and course web sites must identify the course as having been approved for meeting general education requirements and include the general education outcomes for which each course is approved. (See Syllabus Requirements (https://www.ndsu.edu/ facultysenate/gened/syllabi) ) 15.Effective spring semester 2015, students who have completed basic military training (which is the commitment for enlistment) will receive a waiver for the Wellness category. Military record documentation is required for the waiver; documentation is to be submitted to the Office of Registration and Records with a completed Appeal for Exception to General Education Requirements form. The waiver for the training will not lead to course credit, and all other minimum graduation requirements apply. General Education Courses The following is representative of the courses approved in each general education category for the specific catalog year. The general education component requires a minimum of 39 total credits with a minimum credit requirement in each of the seven categories. Cultural diversity and global perspectives may be satisfied by completing courses in another category.

Although subject to revision by the board, the policies at the time of this printing were as follows: If students have completed the lower-division general education course requirements (36 credits or more) at one NDUS institution and transfer to another NDUS institution, then the lower-division general education requirements will have been met. If the lower-division general education requirements have not been completed before transferring, the general education courses from the indicated areas are applicable to an appropriate general education requirement of the institution to which they are transferred. In these cases, the number of credits required to complete the general education requirement in each area is determined by the policies of the institution to which the courses are transferred. Students transferring lower-division general education credits within the North Dakota University System need to consult with advisers in their academic programs at NDSU for two reasons. First, degree requirements of individual programs and colleges at NDSU may exceed the university-wide general education requirements. Second, meeting the university-wide lower-division general education requirements by transfer credits may not necessarily prepare students for advanced, upper-division study in an academic major at NDSU. Students transferring from non-ND University System institutions will have their general education requirements evaluated on a course-by-course basis when they enter NDSU. Undergraduate Classification Undergraduate degree-seeking students are classified according to the total number of credits earned. Classification or standing in a declared plan of study may vary from the classification used by the university in determining academic standing, financial aid award levels, etc. Classification Completed Credits Freshman 0 - 26 Sophomore 27 - 59 Junior 60 - 89 Senior 90 or more Credit limitations may be placed on students who have not been fully admitted to a degree program at NDSU. Undergraduate non-degree student: One who is not seeking a degree or who has not completed the formal application process for admission. A maximum of 15 undergraduate credits may be completed in a non-degree student status. Non-degree students are not eligible for financial aid. Undergraduate Degree and Graduation Information Baccalaureate Degrees To receive a baccalaureate degree from NDSU, students must complete all of the requirements listed in this section as well as those specified for the particular degree program by a college within the university. Students should consult the curriculum guide (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/academics/ curricula) or contact the academic department for further information on degree requirements. Degree candidates must satisfactorily complete one of the degree curricula offered at NDSU. Because curricula are subject to change annually, students are responsible for determining curricular expectations according to the following guidelines: Intended majors and degrees, as well as second majors and minors, must be declared to become official by providing notice to the Office of Registration and Records (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar) , 110 Ceres Hall. Students follow the published curricula for the major program of study declared with the62 Undergraduate Degree and Graduation Information university from the semester/year of entrance at NDSU, from the point a new major is declared, or from the year of admission to a limited- or selective- enrollment program, whichever applies, to graduation provided enrollment at NDSU has not been discontinued for more than one year. Students who advance in limited- or selective-enrollment programs will have their academic program/plan status changed accordingly by the appropriate academic department. Any student who discontinues enrollment at NDSU for more than one calendar year is subject to meeting the curricular requirements in effect at the time of re-entry. Degree and Graduation Requirements Students must satisfactorily complete two sets of requirements: a) university-wide requirements and b) college- or department-level requirements, which include curricular requirements for completing majors and minors. College- and department-level requirements for majors and minors are listed in the college sections (p. 73) of this bulletin under the appropriate college listing, and in curriculum guides (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/academics/ curricula) available online and in academic departments. Minimum degree/graduation requirements are as follows: 1.Academic major requirements: Satisfactory completion of all requirements of the curriculum in which one is enrolled. Earn a minimum total of 120 credits in approved coursework. Requirements for some academic majors exceed this minimum. a.Because curricula are subject to change, intended degrees and majors, as well as second majors and minors, must be declared to be official. This may be done at the point of admission or readmission to the University or by submission of a Major Change form (https://www.ndsu.edu/ registrar/forms/majorchange) to the Office of Registration and Records. b.Students follow the published curricula in place when a major/minor is declared or from the year of admission to a limited- or selective-enrollment program, whichever applies, to graduation provided enrollment at NDSU has not been discontinued for more than one calendar year. c.Students who advance into limited- or selective-enrollment programs will have their academic degree/plan status changed accordingly based on information provided to Registration and Records by the respective academic department. d.Students who discontinue enrollment at NDSU for more than one calendar year are subject to meet the curricular requirements in effect during the term of readmission. e.Each program of study presented by a candidate for the baccalaureate degree is audited for meeting the degree requirements by the Office of Registration and Records. Degree candidates are certified according to total credits and grades earned and other university and degree program requirements. 2.Total degree credits: Earn a minimum total of 120 credits in approved coursework. Requirements for some academic programs exceed this minimum. 3.General education requirements: Satisfactory completion of the general education requirements as specified by the University and in a student's degree and major. 4.Scholastic standing requirement: A minimum institutional grade-point average of 2.00 based on work taken at NDSU for which grades have been assigned is required for graduation. When a course is taken and repeated at NDSU, only the most recent grade and credits earned will be used in computing the cumulative grade-point average. Some academic programs require higher minimum grade-point requirements. 5.Upper-level credit requirements: At least 37 of the credits presented for graduation must be in courses taken at the 300 and 400 level. 6.Transfer Students: Students with transfer credit from another institution must earn a minimum of 60 semester credits from a baccalaureate- degree granting or professional institution. Of these, at least 36 must be NDSU residence credits as defined below. Within these 36 resident credits, minimum requirements include 15 semester credits in courses numbered 300 or above (37 upper-level credits must still be earned in total) and 15 semester credits in the major field of study. 7.Residence requirements: Residence credits include credits registered and paid for at NDSU. These may include courses offered on the NDSU campus, via Tri-College (p. 829), or via NDSU distance education (http://www.ndsu.edu/dce) . At least 36 credits must be NDSU resident credits and ordinarily, the last 30 credits must be earned in residence. Exceptions to the Last 30 Credits Requirements: a.Courses taken as part of a NDSU-sponsored study abroad or exchange program count as residence credit. Students must still fulfill all other graduation requirements. b.Students admitted to an accredited non-baccalaureate professional degree program (eg., Veterinary Medicine, Chiropractic, etc.) at another institution prior to earning their baccalaureate degree from NDSU may be eligible to subsequently earn an NDSU bachelor's degree through the transfer of earned professional course credits. Professional coursework transferred back to fulfill major requirements must be either department- approved as equivalent to NDSU coursework or be authorized via department-approved substitution form. To be considered for this waiver, students must complete and submit an Appeal for Exception to Academic Regulations Form (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms/acadappeal) to the Office of Registration and Records during their last semester of enrollment at NDSU . Students must still fulfill all other graduation requirements. c.Courses taken as a part of a required curriculum in an NDSU-approved dual degree or joint program with another institution (i.e., HDFS/ Elementary Education with VCSU). d.Excluding the above exceptions, students who need to complete a limited number of credits (typically not to exceed nine) to fulfill their graduation requirements, and who are unable to take them at or through NDSU may seek an exception by completing and submitting the Appeal for Exception to Academic Regulations Form (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms/acadappeal) to the Office of Registration prior to enrolling atNorth Dakota State University 63 another institution. To fulfill major requirements, transfer coursework must either be evaluated as equivalent to NDSU courses or be authorized via a department-approved substitution form. Students must still fulfill all other graduation requirements. 8.Financial obligations: Satisfy all financial obligations owed to the university. 9.Application for degree: All candidates for a baccalaureate or Pharmacy Doctorate degree must indicate their intent to graduate when registering for their last semester. The application form (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms/degreeapp) is available online. Failure to apply by the published graduation application deadline of the planned semester of graduation may delay the awarding of the degree until the following semester. If a student fails to complete the required courses by the intended graduation term, the student must reapply for graduation in a following term. Majors and Minors Majors and minors are integral parts of baccalaureate degree curricula. Specific curriculum requirements for majors may be acquired from the appropriate departmental office or from Registration and Records. Students are responsible for following the requirements in place at the time a major or minor is officially declared with the university. Major: A major is a planned grouping of related courses that totals a minimum of 32 credits. Minor: A minor is a similar grouping of courses that totals a minimum of 16 credits. A minimum of eight credits must be earned in residence at NDSU. Second or Multiple Majors: A second (or multiple) major may be earned by completing the requirements of both (or all) majors offered under the same baccalaureate degree. At least 15 unique credits must exist between the majors. When requirements for multiple majors are met concurrently, all majors are displayed on the diploma. Multiple majors or minors may be completed and recorded on the student's academic record after the degree for the first major has been awarded. When majors under different degrees are involved, the requirements for a second degree apply (See next section). Second Degree A second baccalaureate degree may be earned at NDSU with all of the following provisions: 1.All curriculum requirements are satisfactorily completed. 2.A 30-credit minimum is earned in residence beyond all of the credits and degree requirements for the first baccalaureate degree. All requirements for both degrees must be met, including the separate residency requirements at NDSU for each (36 for the first; 30 for the second). Any repeated courses do not count toward the 30 credits. 3.Each baccalaureate degree must be different. However, students may complete requirements for more than one major within a given degree, if available (see second /multiple majors). Certificates A certificate program is a specialized course of study requiring at least 16 credit hours at the undergraduate level or eight credit hours at the graduate level. Certificates may be earned while in pursuit of a degree or as standalone programs of study. Prospective students interested in certificate programs, but not seeking a degree, must be accepted to the university. Contact the Office of Admission (https://www.ndsu.edu/admission) or the Graduate College (https://www.ndsu.edu/gradschool) for further information. Curricular requirements and verification forms are available in academic departments offering certificates. Completed forms must be signed by the appropriate department chair (and Graduate College, if applicable) and submitted to Registration and Records in order for the certificate to be posted to a student's academic record and official documentation issued. Exceptions to Academic Program Requirements Academic policies and curricular requirements are designed to ensure that programs at NDSU are consistently of high quality. Students are expected to complete all curricular requirements, which includes the overall University requirements (includes general education), any college or department requirements if applicable, and major program of study requirements. Students may request substitutions or waivers for college or departmental requirements when extenuating circumstances prevail. Depending on the nature of the requested exception, departmental or college level approval is required. Degree Audits Each program of study presented by a candidate for the baccalaureate degree is audited for meeting the degree requirements by the Office of Registration and Records. Degree candidates are certified by the Office of Registration and Records according to total credits earned, institutional grade-point average, and other university requirements. A degree audit is an official review of graduation requirements to determine a student's graduation eligibility. Undergraduate students who have completed a minimum of 75 credits are notified and asked to complete the degree audit request (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms/degreeaudit) . Degree audits are not automatically completed as student educational and degree goals vary (multiple degree, majors, minors, etc.). An official degree audit typically is completed by the Office of Registration and Records two semesters prior to the student's reported graduation on the audit request.64 Undergraduate Degree and Graduation Information At any time, however, students and their advisers may track degree progress at any time during a student's undergraduate career using the Academic Requirements Report (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/academics/advising/advisement) (automated degree audit) feature on Campus Connection. This functionality is interactive and also allows the student to plan for and register for upcoming semesters within the advisement report. Instructions and information on how to access and read an Academic Requirements Report are available to students and advisers. Bachelor of Arts Requirement Using a Second Language The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree may be conferred upon students who complete the major requirements for their chosen field of study and have functional proficiency in at least one language other than English. The B.A. degree recognizes these students as having acquired the foundation for enhancing their ability to communicate, work, and study in an internationalized world. The B.A. signifies that these students have chosen to develop, through the equivalent of at least four semesters of coursework, both practical language skills and a comparative perspective on their own language and culture. The B.A. second language requirement fosters an awareness of the culturally conditioned nature of the students' assumptions about the world, and it better equips them with the mental agility needed to understand ways of thinking different from their own as they encounter the diversity of professional and personal relationships, as well as the intellectual and practical challenges of their future careers. The second language requirement of the B.A. degree involves student demonstration of functional language proficiency over a sustained period of time, typically 14 credits of coursework. Given the sequential nature of language courses, the assessment of their abilities across the range of skills in speaking, reading, writing and listening comprehension is continuous and demanding. For this reason, NDSU requires that those students who have prior language-learning experience or who present language examination scores (CLEP, etc.) take, at minimum, the exit-level (202) course in order to verify their broad functional ability and basic cultural competence. It is important to note that the language requirement is not defined in credits but in terms of proficiency or communicative competence in all four skills of speaking, reading, writing and listening comprehension. To fulfill the B.A. language requirement a student must demonstrate competence equivalent to that normally attained after four semesters of college study (NDSU level 202). Competency may be demonstrated in the following ways: 1.Completion in any second language of coursework at the NDSU 202 level or its equivalent with a grade of 'C' or better. Note that this requirement cannot be fulfilled by coursework taken pass/fail. 2.Successful completion of any second language course with a grade of 'C' or better that has the equivalent of NDSU 202 or higher as a prerequisite. 3.For students having previously passed the CLEP Examination (p. 44) in French, German or Spanish with a CLEP score high enough for second- year college credit (59 in French, 60 in German and 63 in Spanish) or the AP exam (p. 42) with a minimum score of 4 in French, German or Spanish, taking one additional college-level language class at the 202 level or higher in order to demonstrate competency in all four skill levels. Students must complete this course with a 'C' or better. 4.English satisfies the B.A. language requirement for students whose official, certified transcripts demonstrate that their secondary or higher education was completed in a language other than English. It is the responsibility of the student to provide all necessary untranslated, official documentation to the Department of Modern Languages (https://www.ndsu.edu/modernlanguages) for verification. No credit will be awarded. 5.Students who are unable to provide the above mentioned certified documentation but who are native speakers of languages other than English may fulfill the second language requirement through proficiency in English by successful completion of the three-semester General Education English composition sequence and by passing an additional English (ENGL) course with a 'C' or better. Students having completed this sequence may apply to the Department of Modern Languages (https://www.ndsu.edu/modernlanguages) for a waiver of the Second Language requirement. 6.Requests for determination of proficiency in languages not taught at NDSU are considered by the Department of Modern Languages (https:// www.ndsu.edu/modernlanguages) . If a student would like to demonstrate proficiency through testing in a language that is not taught at NDSU, it is his/her responsibility to arrange for such testing. The proficiency test must be completed by a faculty or staff member at a college or university; the evaluator must hold at least a master's degree (in any discipline). The test must evaluate reading, writing, listening and speaking through the fourth semester (intermediate NDSU 202) college level. The student must provide documentation from the evaluator which includes a copy of the test, a letter from the evaluator assessing the level of proficiency, and a statement of the evaluator's credentials, including an explanation of his/ her expertise in the language being tested, if the evaluator does not teach that language at the college level. No credit is awarded but proficiency requirement is fulfilled. Graduation with Honor Graduation with honor applies only to baccalaureate degrees. Candidates who have earned a minimum of 60 credits in residence at NDSU and a minimum institutional grade point average of 3.50 will graduate with honor. All final grades on the NDSU academic record will be included in grade point average calculations for graduating with honor. Students who meet these academic criteria will graduate according to one of the following honor levels: Honor Criteria Summa Cum Laude equal to or greater than 3.90 Magna Cum Laude equal to or greater than 3.70 and less than 3.90 Cum Laude equal to or greater than 3.50 and less than 3.70North Dakota State University 65 Scholastic Standing Academic progress is measured by grades and credits earned. Students receive acknowledgment for high academic achievement and are given warning at the end of each semester via NDSU email when they become academically deficient. To be eligible to register continuously without conditions, an undergraduate or professional student must maintain good academic standing, which is defined as a minimum cumulative institutional grade point average of 2.00 (4.00 scale). Some programs of study have academic standards higher than the University minimum. Students should consult with their adviser or academic department for program specific requirements. Records of all students are examined at the end of each grading period. Academic standing relates to the following: Good Good standing reflects when a student's term GPA and cumulative GPA are both at or above. 2.00. Academic Warning An academic warning is to alert a student that his/her term GPA is below the minimum required for good standing, even though the institutional cumulative GPA is at or above 2.00. An academic warning does not appear on the official academic transcript but does appear on the unofficial transcript. Students are notified of their academic warning status via official NDSU email. Academic Probation An academic probation is issued when a student who entered the grading period on good standing or academic warning earns an institutional cumulative GPA below the minimum 2.00 for good standing. An academic probation does not appear on the student's official academic transcript, but does appear on the unofficial transcript. An adviser hold is placed on the student's record, and may only be removed by the adviser after the student has met with him/her. Students are notified of their academic probation status via official NDSU email. Continued Probation Continued probation is a formal extension of the academic probation status. It is issued when a student enters the grading period on academic probation or continued probation, shows adequate progress by attaining a minimum term GPA of 2.00, but his/her cumulative institutional GPA is still below the minimum 2.00 for good standing. Continued probation does not appear on the student's official academic transcript, but does appear on the unofficial transcript. An adviser hold is placed on the student's record, and may only be removed by the adviser after the student has met with him/her. Students are notified of their continued probation status via official NDSU email. Academic Suspension Academic suspension is issued when a student enters the term on either probation or continued probation and earns both a term GPA and institutional cumulative GPA below the minimum 2.00 for good standing. This includes students admitted on probation for their first semester at NDSU or readmitted on probation following an academic suspension. A student may not be considered for readmission for two grading periods following an academic suspension (includes summer). An academic suspension appears on the student's official academic transcript. A suspension hold is placed on the student's record by the Office of Registration and Record which prevents all future registration. If a student has pre-registered for classes in a future semester, these courses will be administratively removed by the Office of Registration and Records. Students who are suspended are notified of their suspension status via official NDSU email. Filing a Suspension Appeal Based on Extenuating Circumstances A student who has been suspended may appeal the suspension but only if there are extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control that can be supported with documentation. An Appeal Academic Suspension (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/registrar/forms/suspappeal.pdf) form is available online and must be submitted to the Office of Registration and Records no later than the deadline published on the appeal form. If approved, the student must make satisfactory academic progress in the subsequent term according to the published academic standards of the University (see above). Readmission After Serving an Academic Suspension To be considered for readmission after serving an academic suspension, students must sit out a minimum of two semesters (includes summer) and file a Reactivation/Petition for Readmission Form (https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/rr/forms/reactivation) to the Office of Registration and Records a minimum of 30 business days prior to the beginning of the semester in which the student is eligible for readmission or for when readmission is sought. The petition is reviewed by a college committee and if approved, the student will be readmitted on academic probation and may register for classes. Students who enrolled in courses at another institution while serving the terms of an NDSU academic suspension must arrange for an official transcript to be sent to the Office of Registration and Records before readmission will be considered. Students re-entering NDSU from an academic suspension who attended courses elsewhere must earn a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00 in those classes. NDSU reserves the right to revoke readmission if official transcripts are not received or the final cumulative GPA from a sending institution is below 2.00.66 Transfer and Test Credit An Academic Suspension from Another Institution NDSU honors suspensions of other institutions. Transfer and returning students who have been suspended from another institution may not be considered for admission or readmission until one year has lapsed or the suspension has been lifted. Students who fail to report all previous college work are subject to dismissal or loss of credit or both. Courses previously completed at NDSU may only be repeated at NDSU for grade and GPA improvement on the NDSU academic record, with the exception of Tri-College courses (see Repeated Courses (p. 40) section for more details). To be eligible for inclusion on the Dean's List for any given semester, a student must have earned a minimum grade-point average of 3.50 during that term while completing at least 12 semester hours (nine semester hours during the summer) in graded coursework. Graded coursework for Dean's List consideration includes the MATH 098 developmental course, which does not satisfy a requirement for graduation and is not calculated into the cumulative grade-point average displayed on the NDSU academic transcript. The Dean's List is only maintained for undergraduate students and professional (Pharm.D.) students. Credits taken simultaneously via transfer, collaborative or consortium registration are not included in the NDSU Dean's List calculation and do not count toward the NDSU minimum credit requirement. Notification : The Office of Registration and Record notifies the Dean's Office within each academic college and University News. A former NDSU student who has not completed a baccalaureate degree and has not been in attendance at NDSU for six (6) or more years, but who is presently enrolled at NDSU, may request to exclude from grade-point-average calculations all grades earned in selected full terms (quarters or semesters) completed at NDSU prior to the six-year interval. The courses and grades for the terms selected will remain on the student's academic record, but credits, honor points, and grades will be excluded from grade-point average calculations. Excluded courses cannot be used to satisfy any academic requirements. A student may exercise this option only once by submitting a written request to the Office of Registration and Records (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar) . Transfer and Test Credit Transfer credit evaluations are conducted in the Office of Registration and Records (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar) . The evaluation process begins after a student is admitted to the university by the Office of Admission (https://www.ndsu.edu/admission) , or has completed the reactivation process with the Office of Registration and Records, if a returning NDSU student. The evaluation process takes 6-8 weeks on average. Evaluation of Transfer Credit from U.S. Institutions The Office of Registration and Records administers the NDSU policies governing the acceptance of college credit from outside institutions. These requirements apply to returning students who have attended other institutions, as well as new NDSU students. Before credits may be evaluated for specific NDSU course equivalency or application to programs of study, transfer courses must be accepted for university credit according to the following guidelines: 1.Credit by examination (p. 42) or College-level coursework from regionally accredited colleges or universities (or equivalent for international institutions) is eligible for acceptance in transfer. 2.Courses will not be accepted in transfer to replace any grades or credits earned at NDSU. If a course is completed at NDSU and an attempt is made to repeat that course elsewhere, the course is considered duplication and is not eligible for transfer. (See also Repeated Courses (p. 40) policy) 3.Credit for a remedial course is not accepted for transfer if the course is remedial by definition of the transferring institution or if it is equivalent to a remedial course at NDSU. It may, however, fulfill prerequisite requirements, if applicable. 4.Credit will be evaluated not only as it appears on the transcript, but also on the basis by which the credit was initially awarded by the sending institution. Credit by examination, credit awarded via placement, or life experience credit awarded by another institution is not accepted in transfer. 5.The Office of Registration and Records determines the applicability of transfer credit toward NDSU general education requirements (p. 51) according to institutional and North Dakota University System guidelines. 6.College-level credits that do not have course equivalents at NDSU will be accepted as free electives and may count only toward total credits. An academic department may determine whether these transfer electives may satisfy specific curricular requirements through a course substitution process. (See also General Education Administrative Policies (p. 54).) 7.NDSU requires that a minimum of 37 credits toward a baccalaureate degree be earned at the junior or senior (300- and 400-level) level. Therefore, while a freshman- or sophomore-level (100- or 200-level) course transferred from another institution may satisfy a specific upper-level program requirement at NDSU, that course will not be counted toward the 37-credit upper-division degree requirement. 8.Transferable courses with 'D' grades or above will be accepted by the university; however, many colleges and departments have higher standards to determine course applicability toward their respective majors and programs. 9.The name of transfer institutions and total credits accepted by NDSU will be indicated on the official NDSU transcript. Individual transfer courses are not detailed on the academic transcript, but are provided in an official transfer evaluation and academic advisement report (https://www.ndsu.edu/ registrar/academics/advising/advisement) after admission to the university. 10.Total transfer credits are converted to semester credits, if applicable.North Dakota State University 67 11.Transfer grades are recorded but not computed in the institutional cumulative GPA. They are used only for purposes of admission to the University, admission to certain programs, and for some scholarships and financial aid. Evaluation of Transfer Credit from International Institutions According to North Dakota University System policy effective January 2013, international transcripts must be submitted to an approved external evaluation service. Obtaining an evaluation is the sole responsibility of the student. Evaluations must be submitted according to the guidelines listed below. The guidelines for the evaluation of transfer credit listed for Domestic/US Institutions also apply to international transfer credit. NDSU students participating in an approved study-abroad program are not required to submit transcripts from study abroad experiences to an evaluation service. International students transferring from a North Dakota State University partnership institution are exempt from submitting an external international evaluation. Students must submit official transcripts to one of the following approved evaluators: the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admission Officers (AACRAO) International Education Services (http://ies.aacrao.org) , a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES) (http://www.naces.org/members.htm) , or a member of the Association of International Credential Evaluators (AICE) (http://www.aice-eval.org) . Official transcript(s) issued in English must be submitted to NDSU in addition to the evaluation unless the evaluation service provides certification of student documents and sends copies of transcript(s) to NDSU. Currently World Education Services (WES) (https://www.wes.org) is the only organization that provides NDSU with the required, certified documentation. New transfer students who have completed coursework at an institution outside the United States must submit transcripts to an approved evaluation service for a course by course evaluation. New international students should send evaluations directly to the NDSU International Student and Study Abroad Services Office (https:// www.ndsu.edu/international) . New domestic students or United States permanent resident students should send evaluations directly to the NDSU Office of Admission (https:// www.ndsu.edu/admission) . Students must submit course descriptions for all completed coursework directly from the international institution to the NDSU Office of Registration and Records (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar) . Effective January 2015, all international transfer English coursework from non-native English speaking countries will not be accepted. English Coursework will transfer as remedial credit, and will be listed as equivalent to ENGL DEV at NDSU. Common Course Numbers Institutions in the North Dakota University System have established common course numbers (CCN) (https://www.ndus.edu/employees/articulation- transfer/courses-with-common-transferrable-content) to facilitate transfer within the University System. Under the CCN agreement, transfer students who have successfully completed CCN courses will not be required to retake them at NDSU unless their degree program requires a higher grade. However, CCN courses will not fulfill residence requirements nor will 100- and 200-level courses fulfill upper-division requirements for graduation.68 Student Resources Student Resources Diverse services and reinforcement programs are available to students at NDSU.

At NDSU those students are served through the Advising Resource Center (ARC), whose mission is to guide academic exploration, provide advising services to undeclared/exploratory students, and support academic and career exploration. Working one-on-one with an academic advisor in the ARC, students choose one of five Exploratory Areas to guide their academic choices. Exploratory Areas are collections of majors at NDSU that can lead to careers in related fields. The five Exploratory Areas are listed below; for a full list of majors included in each Area, visit the Advising Resource Center (https://www.ndsu.edu/advising_resource_center/exploratory_students/exploratory_areas) .

Most students declare a major by the time they have completed approximately 45 credits or about three semesters of classwork. Advising Resource Center Services After students choose an Exploratory Area and work with an advisor to plan a class schedule, ARC professional staff continues to guide and support students in their academic and career exploration in multiple ways: Professional academic advisors in the ARC have experience working one-on-one with exploratory students and are available for scheduled appointments or drop-in questions throughout the academic year. The ARC maintains a list of courses that can either serve as an introduction to a particular major or as a foundational course in that major's curriculum; advisors work with students to choose appropriate classes from this list as a major exploratory tool. Interested students are encouraged to enroll in a one-credit career-planning course taught by a career counselor from the NDSU Counseling Center for further guided exploration. ARC advisors regularly connect students with faculty, staff, and other campus resources to answer questions and provide further information regarding major and career exploration. First-Year Experience Course UNIV 189: Skills for Academic Success is the first-year experience course for exploratory students taught by an ARC advisor who will work with that class of students during their major exploration process. In addition to supporting the college transition through lessons on campus resources, study skills, time management and related topics, UNIV 189 instructors guide and support students' academic exploration through a variety of activities. Students complete the Strong Interest Inventory, a formal assessment of academic and career interests explained in class by the Counseling Center's career counselor; students tend to rate this activity as one of the most helpful components of the course. Additionally, guest speakers from the NDSU Career Center, other academic advisors and faculty from majors of interest, and a variety of guided exploration activities lead students through the process of researching majors, careers, job outlooks and expected salaries. The goal of UNIV 189 is to give students resources they need to make informed decisions regarding their academic major and career goals at NDSU.

Grafton Morrill Hall 315, 701-231-8790, www.ag.ndsu.edu/academics Academic programs in the College of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Natural Resources open doors to exciting and rewarding career and professional opportunities. Agriculture is the foundation upon which NDSU was established in the late 1800s. Today, the college builds on that tradition with teaching, research, and outreach that serves the interests of students and the needs of employers, fuels an economic engine critical to the United States, and improves the lives of people throughout the region and the world. Mission and Values The college provides relevant and challenging academic programs that prepare students to capitalize on current and future opportunities. Programs are based on fundamental sciences and technologies applied to agricultural life and environmental disciplines as well as related social and economic fields. NDSU Agriculture, Food Systems and Natural Resources is taking its place as one of the nation's leaders. Our commitment to excellence has inspired new courses of study and has built ongoing partnerships with agricultural industries and government agencies. Demand for graduates with expertise in the college's many disciplines continues to grow rapidly. Career opportunities for men and women are expanding into new areas made possible by new technologies and a more comprehensive global perspective. Food safety and security, biotechnology and genetics, sustainable production and land stewardship, bio-energy and bio-products, and human/animal health are emerging national priorities. Our faculty are at the forefront of these and similar critical issues. Our students can engage their interests while gaining valuable hands-on learning experiences in the field, laboratories, and through interactions with business partners across the region. Agricultural Education NDSU is designated by the State Board for Career and Technical Education as the recognized institution for preparing teachers of Agricultural Education. While the degree program in Agricultural Education is offered by the College of Human Development and Education, students may pursue their degree in Agricultural Education by doing a major in General Agriculture (College of Agriculture, Food Systems and Natural Resources) and a degree in Agricultural Education (College of Human Development and Education). Pursuit of both majors should not increase the total number of credits needed to obtain the degree. Generally, students will start with the major in General Agriculture and add the major in Agricultural Education prior to requesting admittance into the Teacher Education program. The adviser in Agricultural Education will generally serve as the academic adviser from matriculation to completion so there is not a need to change advisers when the major in Agricultural Education is added. See the School of Education (https://www.ndsu.edu/education) section in this Bulletin under the College of Human Development and Education (p. 372) for more information. Interdisciplinary Studies and Affiliated Programs The college contributes strongly to interdisciplinary studies in natural resources management, food safety, logistics management, and several graduate programs. See Interdisciplinary Programs (p. 526) section of this Bulletin for more information. A major in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering is offered by the College of Engineering (p. 306). The College of Human Development and Education (p. 372) offers a major in Agricultural Education74 College of Agriculture, Food Systems, & Natural Resources and the College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences (p. 166) offers a major in Agricultural Communication. These majors rely on the expertise and resources from the College of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Natural Resources. Graduate and Professional Schools The college's academic programs are excellent preparation for continued formal education in graduate school programs and in professional schools offering degrees in business, law, medicine or veterinary medicine. For more information on graduate school opportunities at NDSU see the Graduate School (https://www.ndsu.edu/gradschool) web site. Honor System A student-elected honor system (http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/academics/honor-system-1) recognizes the ability of students to govern themselves. The honor system, in place since 1955, provides an enhanced learning environment. All students enrolled in programs and courses offered by the College of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Natural Resources are required to uphold the honor system. Scholarships Students in the college who have selected one of the college's majors may be eligible for scholarships through their major department and/or the dean's office. Scholarships are awarded to students who have demonstrated excellence in their courses. About one-third of students in the college receive scholarships. Students are encouraged to contact their major department or the college web site for scholarship opportunities (http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/ academics/scholarships) . Student Organizations Nearly 30 agriculture-related clubs and organizations (http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/academics/student-organizations) provide opportunities for students to develop leadership, teamwork, interpersonal and communication skills. Field Experience, Internships, Cooperative Education Students gain practical experience and credits by enrolling in a supervised field experience (internship) offered through individual departments. Another option, offered by the Career Center (https://www.ndsu.edu/career) , provides undergraduate and graduate students with career-enhancing experiences and academic credits through the Cooperative Education program (https://career.ndsu.edu/internship-program) . The number of cooperative education credits allowed for graduation varies by program, but should not exceed six for any program in the college. International Study The college encourages students to gain international perspectives in their studies.

Traditionally, students interested in careers focusing on agricultural production follow the General Agriculture curriculum or pursue majors in Animal Science, Crop and Weed Science, Equine Science or Horticulture. Students electing to graduate with a General Agriculture major must file a \"plan of study\" with the General Agriculture Coordinating Committee by the third week of the semester in which they will complete at least 75 credits. This plan must an outline of courses to be taken to meet the disciplinary requirements and the Agriculture electives, for completion of the General Agriculture degree. Identification of the capstone course and any internship that the student plans to take should also be included in the plan of study. The General Agriculture major is also a good approach to pursuit of a degree in Agricultural Education. A student may choose General Agriculture as a first major and Agricultural Education as a second major and complete the requirements for both degrees. General Agriculture Minor A minor in General Agriculture may be obtained by satisfactorily completing 24 credits with at least six credits in each of any four disciplines offered by the College of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Natural Resources. A minimum of eight credits must be taken at NDSU. Students must earn a 2.00 minimum GPA in the courses used to satisfy the minor requirements. Major Requirements General Agriculture Major Degree Type: B.S. Minimum Degree Credits to Graduate: 12880 General Agriculture General Education Requirements for Baccalaureate Degree A list of approved general education courses is available here (p. 54). General education courses may be used to satisfy requirements for both general education and the major, minor, and program emphases, where applicable. Students should carefully review the major, minor, and program emphases requirements for minimum grade restrictions, should they apply.

A capstone experience is required in one of the disciplines. Disciplines which may be combined and advisor will complete a substitution form with the courses to be used for the discipline groups and agriculture electives. This form will also require the signature of the department chairperson before being submitted to the Office of Registration and Records for verification of major program completion.North Dakota State University 81 3AGRI189 is only required for first-time, first-year students--A first-time, first-year student is defined as a student who has not yet completed a college course as a college student. Students that are not first-time, first-year students that either transfer into the university or change their major are not required to take AGRI 189. Degree and Major Notes If a course is used to fulfill General Education or Major Requirements it cannot be used towards the disciplines. This includes; PLSC 315 Genetics , ECON 201 Principles of Microeconomics and STAT 330 Introductory Statistics . A General Agriculture Plan of Study must be completed with the student's assigned academic adviser prior to the completion of 75 credits. See department for this process.

Pre-Veterinary Medicine NDSU offers excellent programs that prepare students for application to a college of veterinary medicine. All veterinary schools stress the importance of high scholastic standing and judge applicants on academic preparation, knowledge of the veterinary profession, experience and character. Because the number of students admitted to veterinary schools is limited, prospective students should check the specific requirements of the college of their choice well in advance to make certain that preparatory work is appropriate. Pre-veterinary medicine is not a specific major, and students are encouraged to pursue a major in their area of interest while at NDSU. In addition, students preparing for application to a veterinary school should consult with a pre-veterinary medicine advisor. Although a student may pursue a wide variety of majors while completing the pre-veterinary requirements, we recommend a major in Microbiology (https://bulletin.ndsu.edu/undergraduate/ colleges/agriculture-food-systems-natural-resources/microbiological-sciences) or Animal Science (https://bulletin.ndsu.edu/undergraduate/colleges/ agriculture-food-systems-natural-resources/animal-sciences/animal-science) with the Animal Biomedical Sciences option. We urge you to examine the Department of Microbiological Sciences, Pre-Veterinary Medicine (https://www.ndsu.edu/micro/students/prospective/our-undergrad-programs/ pre-vet-medicine) website or the Department of Animal Sciences Pre-Veterinary Medicine (https://www.ag.ndsu.edu/ansc/undergraduate-programs-1/ preveterinary-medicine) website for further information. Students who are admitted to and plan to enroll in a Veterinary Medical College prior to earning a baccalaureate degree from NDSU should consult with their academic adviser for options on transferring veterinary medicine credit back to NDSU to fulfill bachelor's degree requirements.82 Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics www.ag.ndsu.edu/agecon/ The Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics offers three majors: (1) Agribusiness, (2) Agricultural Economics, and (3) Economics, and two minors: (1) Agribusiness and (2) Economics. Each of these programs is based on the same fundamental economic concepts and theory, but each program offers students an opportunity to focus their studies on their individual interests. Economic theory provides a systematic and logical framework for analyzing how a society solves the problem of scarcity in deciding what goods and services to produce, how to organize production, and for whom goods and services are to be produced. Knowledge of economics is necessary to understand and deal with topics such as economic growth, monetary systems, international trade, inflation, risk analysis and management, unemployment, government finance, and various forms of market regulation. As global population grows and the world's economies become more interdependent, economic principles become increasingly important when analyzing economic relationships, solving problems, and pursuing opportunities among nations and economies throughout the world. In each major, students study communication, mathematics, science and computer skills. Introductory and intermediate courses in economics address 1.microeconomic theory, which is the study of relative prices, the consequences of different market forms, and consumer behavior, and 2.macroeconomic theory, which includes the study of the general level of prices, employment, and output. Students whose studies are based on economic concepts are in high demand. Employers recognize the need to understand global trends in order to contribute to private and public economic decisions. Agribusiness, Agricultural Economics and Economics majors are employed in virtually every area of the economy. In banks and financial institutions, they forecast market activity, exchange rates, and interest rate movements. In industrial firms, they forecast sales, evaluate changes in cost conditions, analyze changes in international economic conditions, and provide data needed for critical decisions. Governments are among the largest employers of economists because agencies rely on the skills of these professionals to evaluate and review proposed projects and policies. Virtually no other academic major offers the diversity in employment opportunities and flexibility among careers, as does the study of economic concepts and their application in problem solving and decision making. A background in economics provides students with a set of versatile skills that will not become obsolete with the introduction of new technology. Each program, as described in the following sections, includes opportunities for students to study additional disciplines. Agribusiness (p. 82) Agricultural Economics (p. 86) Economics (p. 89) Logistics Management (p. 292) Agribusiness Agribusiness Major The Agribusiness major allows students to focus their understanding of economics on the agribusiness sector. Students interested in careers in agribusiness have several options. Beginning in their sophomore year, students take courses in management, marketing and finance, all concentrating on the unique aspects of food and bio-systems economics. Specialization in upper division courses permits students to further concentrate based on their particular interest: Management: This option provides students with a broad background, preparing them for general career alternatives in agribusiness. Finance: This option prepares students for careers in agribusiness finance, agricultural lending, financial institution management, accounting, insurance, and investment. Marketing: This option prepares students for careers in agricultural marketing, sales, or food product marketing. In the Agribusiness program, students are exposed to a range of methods useful in agribusiness decision-making. Agribusiness graduates will master problem-solving skills to face challenges likely to be encountered in their professional careers. Agribusiness students are required to participate in an internship during their studies. Employers continue to place high importance on work-related experience when they evaluate potential employees. Employers are assured that all NDSU Agribusiness graduates have gained this valuable work experience through the required internship. Collaboration with the College of Business (p. 276) leads to the concurrent satisfaction of one of the minors offered by the College of Business. Students may select business courses for the minor that complement their agribusiness interests.North Dakota State University 83 Agribusiness Minor The Agribusiness minor exposes students to applications of fundamental business concepts in an agricultural or food systems setting. A minimum of eight credits must be completed at NDSU. The Agribusiness minor is open to all NDSU majors. Major Requirements Major: Agribusiness Degree Type: B.S.

Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering www.ndsu.edu/aben/ www.ndsu.edu/aben The mission of the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at North Dakota State University is to serve students and our profession by providing quality educational programs that prepare graduates for 21st century living and career opportunities. The programs are designed to provide education, research, and effective extension programs that help people improve their lives through the educational process using research- based knowledge focused on issues and needs. Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering strives to generate new knowledge in engineering and allied technologies for production agriculture, the food system, and related environmental resources. Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering houses two separate majors; Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering (p. 99) and Agricultural Systems Management (p. 94). Agricultural and Biosystems engineers apply their engineering skills towards sustainable production of food, feed, fiber, and fuel; the necessities of life. Agricultural Systems Management program prepares men and women for careers requiring integration and application of engineering technology, agricultural and biological sciences, and business to manage resources and systems for producing, processing, and marketing food and other biological products worldwide. Our students are active in a variety of extra-curricular programs (https://www.ndsu.edu/aben/current-students/undergraduate/student-organizations- clubs). Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering (p. 99) Agricultural Systems Management (p. 94) Agricultural Systems Management Agricultural Systems Management The Agricultural Systems Management (ASM) program combines an understanding of the agricultural, biological, and physical sciences with economics, managerial, and technical skills. This understanding of science, systems management, and applications engineering can be applied to a career in the production and processing of food, feed, fiber, and fuel, and the marketing, sales, and distribution of agricultural products and services. Students focus on the application of engineering designs, the study of technology used in agriculture, and the integration of business management concepts in the agricultural, food, and closely related industries. Students complete courses in machinery principles, off-road power systems, precision agriculture, commodity handling and processing, natural resources management, electrical and electronic systems, and information and decision support technology. Taking courses in accounting, economics, marketing, management, business law, sales, and finance develops a strong business background. Personal career objectives may be pursued through specialization in areas such as agribusiness and production agriculture. Students are encouraged to minor in agribusiness, business administration, communication, or another agricultural discipline. Agricultural Systems Management graduates are often self-employed as owners/operators of commercial farms, ranches, and businesses. Others are employed in positions that provide the link between the consumer and people in fields such as research design, engineering, or manufacturing. They are often also employed as crop consultants or production specialists. Employers include: 1.companies and agencies that provide inputs, products, and services for agricultural production; 2.companies or agencies in the business of handling, storing, processing, and distributing agricultural products/commodities and processed food or non-food products; and 3.companies and agencies that supply physical and business services to rural and urban communities. This degree is ideal for those interested in careers in technical sales or management of an agriculture-related business involved in production, processing, or manufacturing. The flexibility of the program allows students the opportunity to tailor the curriculum to complement their career goals.North Dakota State University 95 Students interested in the design, testing, manufacturing, and development aspects of products, processes, or systems for agricultural production, food, and value-added processing of commodities, or sustainable management of environmental resources should consider the Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering (p. 99) curriculum.

A major in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering can serve a broad range of career interests and can provide excellent career opportunities for men and women from diverse backgrounds. The program educational objectives of this major are to educate and produce graduates who will become engineers who: 1.have the ability to use their technical knowledge and design and problem solving skills throughout their careers, 2.have the interpersonal and collaborative skills and the capacity necessary for productive careers, and 3.can use their disciplinary knowledge and educational depth and breadth to deal with changing career opportunities in agricultural and related industries. These objectives support the department mission of developing and extending knowledge through engineering and technology that advances the productivity of agricultural production, the processing and utilization of biological materials, and the management of environmental resources. Agricultural and biosystems engineering integrates engineering topics, engineering design, and biological sciences in a single program with two concentrations: agricultural engineering and biosystems engineering. While there is considerable overlap between the agricultural engineering (AGEN) and the biosystems engineering (BSEN) concentrations, the BSEN concentration includes a heavier emphasis on fundamental biological and chemical sciences. The AGEN concentration includes a heavier emphasis in the physical sciences. A wide range of electives in related disciplines can be used to100 Agricultural & Biosystems Engineering compliment the disciplinary course work and to prepare for specific career interests. Although not required by the curriculum, students are encouraged to take advantage of Cooperative Education experiences or the opportunity of paid internships where they gain hands-on experience in engineering. Agricultural Engineering Option Career opportunities for graduates in agricultural engineering are many and diverse. Graduates may work for companies and agencies that design, develop, test, and manufacture power and machine systems; handle, store, and process agricultural commodities; design environmental controls and housing systems for plant and animal production; design equipment and systems for processing, manufacturing, distribution and quality protection of food products; design systems for management of air, land and water resources; design and manage crop irrigation systems; and develop electrical and electronic applications for agricultural problems. Graduates with an agricultural engineering concentration may also pursue graduate degrees in engineering, business, or law. By selecting appropriate elective courses, students may emphasize areas such as agricultural systems, environmental systems, biomaterials and processing systems, or an emphasis area designed by the student in consultation with an adviser. The faculty assist with career planning and job placement of graduates. Students interested in careers involving production, delivery, management, and technical support of systems for food, agricultural, or closely related industries rather than engineering or design should consider the Agricultural Systems Management major (p. 94) offered by the College of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Natural Resources (http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/ academics) .

This understanding of science, systems management, and applications engineering can be applied to a career in the production and processing of food, feed, fiber, and fuel, and the marketing, sales, and distribution of agricultural products and services. Students focus on the application of engineering designs, the study of technology used in agriculture, and the integration of business management concepts in the agricultural, food, and closely related industries. Students complete courses in machinery principles, off-road power systems, precision agriculture, commodity handling and processing, natural resources management, electrical and electronic systems, and information and decision support technology. Taking courses in accounting, economics, marketing, management, business law, sales, and finance develops a strong business background. Personal career objectives may be pursued through specialization in areas such as agribusiness and production agriculture. Students are encouraged to minor in agribusiness, business administration, communication, or another agricultural discipline. Agricultural Systems Management graduates are often self-employed as owners/operators of commercial farms, ranches, and businesses. Others are employed in positions that provide the link between the consumer and people in fields such as research design, engineering, or manufacturing. They are often also employed as crop consultants or production specialists. Employers include: 1.companies and agencies that provide inputs, products, and services for agricultural production; 2.companies or agencies in the business of handling, storing, processing, and distributing agricultural products/commodities and processed food or non-food products; and 3.companies and agencies that supply physical and business services to rural and urban communities. This degree is ideal for those interested in careers in technical sales or management of an agriculture-related business involved in production, processing, or manufacturing. The flexibility of the program allows students the opportunity to tailor the curriculum to complement their career goals. Students interested in the design, testing, manufacturing, and development aspects of products, processes, or systems for agricultural production, food, and value-added processing of commodities, or sustainable management of environmental resources should consider the Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering (p. 99) curriculum.North Dakota State University 113 Curriculum Options Production Agriculture: Students select courses in agricultural sciences and supporting areas to achieve career goals in the technical and management aspects of production agriculture systems.

Increasing global demands for fresh water, sustainable food supplies, energy, and a healthy environment requires preparation of graduates to study and manage these complex issues. The School of Natural Resource Sciences offers degrees in Natural Resource Management, Range Science, Soil Science, and Entomology. Faculty in the School are nationally recognized and careers range from local agronomists to global resource policy makers. Natural Resources Management (p. 135) Range Science (p. 144) Soil Science (p. 146) Natural Resources Management With increasing human pressure and a growing need to balance competing demands, our world needs new and better ways to manage society's impacts on the environment. The Natural Resources Management program prepares students for challenging careers requiring the sustainability perspective and global social perspective necessary for examining and solving complex natural resources management problems. Our goal is the highest and best societal uses of natural resources while maintaining the integrity of life-sustaining socio-ecological systems. Career opportunities abound in federal, state and local government, the private sector, non-profit conservation and environmental organizations, as well as higher education and research. An interdisciplinary major in NRM leads to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree. Students benefit from faculty engagement from the various colleges across the university in the coordination of the program, classroom teaching and advising. During the first four semesters of the NRM program, students complete a broad foundation of core courses in the social, biological, and physical sciences. The second half of the program offers students the opportunity to focus on a specific area of interest (emphasis). NRM offers six emphasis areas, each allowing students the flexibility to select courses for specialized career preparation. Biotic Resources Science: deals with basic scientific principles that govern the interrelationship between biotic (e.g., plants, animals) and abiotic factors (e.g., climate, soils) in major ecosystems and the use of these principles for environmentally sound management of both natural and agro- ecosystems. Environmental Communication: is designed for environmentally oriented students preparing for careers in communication fields such as journalism, public relations, broadcast media and the internet. Natural Resources Economics: prepares students for management, administrative, regulatory, and policy positions that require a broad understanding of natural resources management and allocation. Physical/Earth Resources Science: leads to an understanding of the physical and chemical aspects of ecosystems. Topics of study include hydrology, water management and quality, waste management, soil properties, energy resources and land-use management. Pollution Control: focuses on the principles and practices of managing natural resources for pollution control. Topics include the technical aspects of pollution as they relate to water, air/solids, earth/soils, and the impact of environmental pollution on biotic factors. Students interested in this emphasis are strongly urged to complete College Algebra before entering the NRM program. Social Sciences: concentrates on human factors (social, political, anthropological) in environmental management and environmental disaster management, while recognizing constraints and opportunities presented by physical and biological factors.136 Natural Resources Management Sustainability and Resiliency: focuses on how to build capacity to deal with change; prepares students through system, strategic, and anticipatory thinking.

Rangelands are important for the diverse array of products and services they provide, including livestock production, wildlife habitat, clean air and water, and recreation to name a few. Rangeland ecosystems comprise over 40% of the earth's land and include grasslands, savannahs, shrublands, deserts, alpine meadows, marshes and wetlands. Rangelands are comprised mainly of native grasses, forbs, and shrubs which are extremely productive and rich in biodiversity. Just as rangeland ecosystems are diverse, so too are the careers available in rangeland management. Professional career options for rangeland managers are in private and public land management, educators, ranching, wildlife and fisheries, hydrology and economics, scientists, and consultants. The majority of graduates in Range Science find employment with consulting firms, private industry, non-profit organizations, and state and federal agencies. Many of the state and federal agency jobs are as range conservationists with the USDA Forest Service and Natural Resource Conservation Service; USDI Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service; Bureau of Indian Affairs; and state agencies that include State Land Departments, State Health Departments and universities. Students in the Range Science program will take courses in animal sciences, biology, botany, chemistry, ecology, economics, natural resources management, plant sciences, range science, statistics, wildlife management, zoology, as well as the requirements of general education.

Soil Science Soil Science is a field-oriented discipline that defines, investigates, and utilizes one of the most important of our natural resources. All terrestrial life depends upon the soil for food and clean water. Knowledge of soil science is critical to address environmental problems, such as wetland protection, habitat restoration, and waste disposal, and it is vital to ensure sustainability of agricultural and forest products. Soil expertise is also essential in the emerging fields of urban and sustainable agriculture. Soils are complex and constantly evolving natural systems, hence the curriculum accentuates physical, biological, and earth sciences. A soil science degree prepares a student with the training to enter careers in both traditional agriculture and the environmental sectors, including: environmental consulting, soil conservation and resource management, production agriculture, and state and federal research and regulatory agencies.

Department of Plant Sciences www.ag.ndsu.edu/plantsciences The plant-based agriculture and food industries are an integral part of our everyday lives. The crop sciences will be essential in ensuring a plentiful and safe food supply and will require graduates that can provide leadership in high quality crop production and sustainable farming practices around the world. Horticulture involves intensive cropping technology, including the development, production, distribution and utilization of vegetables, fruits, turfgrass, woody landscape and greenhouse plants. Food scientists use basic sciences and engineering to convert crops into everyday food products found in the marketplace. The NDSU Department of Plant Sciences provides students with the knowledge, skills and understanding critical forNorth Dakota State University 149 professional success in a changing world. Our curriculum includes majors in Crop and Weed Sciences, Food Science, and Horticulture. Within these majors multiple curriculum options are available to refine a student's career path. Crop and Weed Sciences (p. 149) Food Science (p. 152) Horticulture (p. 154) Crop and Weed Sciences Crop and Weed Sciences Major Instruction in crop and weed sciences includes field and forage crop production and management, weed science, general and plant genetics, plant breeding, and biotechnology. The study of botany and other plant sciences, entomology, plant pathology, and soil science is basic or related to crop and weed sciences. Students may obtain either a major or minor. The Crop and Weed Sciences major or minor is intended for general use in sales, research, and technical services (crop consultant) of agribusinesses involved in seed, chemical, and other plant production, protection, and management aspects; in natural resources conservation service; by those interested in production agriculture; or as a prerequisite for graduate study. For more details on M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, see the Graduate School Bulletin (p. 531).

Department of Microbiological Sciences This department offers instruction in microbiology, including courses in general microbiology, pathogenic microbiology, parasitology, virology, immunology, food microbiology, microbial physiology and bacterial genetics. Biotechnology (p. 160) Microbiology (p. 163) Biotechnology Biotechnology is an interdisciplinary field based on a combination of biology and technology. It includes the application of science and technology to the design of new plants, animals, and microorganisms that have improved characteristics. The methodologies include the use of recombinant DNA for gene cloning and gene transfers between organisms, culture of plant and animal cells and tissues, fusion of animal cells or plant protoplasts, and the regeneration of whole plants from single cells. Biotechnology also is concerned with the large-scale fermentation processes that utilize some of these novel organisms for the production of pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tests for diseases, feed additives, enzymes, and hormones. Biotechnology offers seemingly unlimited opportunities to combine genes from related or unrelated species to produce useful organisms with desirable properties that were not previously found in nature. The development of crop plants that are resistant to herbicides or insects, the production of human growth hormone and insulin by genetically engineered bacteria, and the development of unique vaccines are all examples of successful biotechnology. The Biotechnology program is offered in either the College of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Natural Resources (http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/academics) or the College of Science and Mathematics (https://www.ndsu.edu/scimath) and leads to the Bachelor of Science degree or Bachelor of Arts degree (College of Science and Mathematics only). The curriculum is designed to provide students with knowledge and experience in both basic and applied sciences. Students have an opportunity to work with scientists in various areas including, animal science, biochemistry, biology, botany, chemistry, horticulture, microbiology, pharmaceutical sciences, plant pathology, plant science, and zoology. Faculty in each of the cooperating life-science departments has been identified to serve as advisers and research mentors for students who select the biotechnology major. Graduates of this program have excellent opportunities for employment in the biotechnology industry or for graduate education. Students majoring in biotechnology are required to perform a research project in the laboratory of a faculty member/scientist, and to prepare a senior thesis describing their research project. A 2.50 institutional grade-point average is required to graduate from the program.

Microbiology Microbiology is a fundamental biological science which offers a variety of challenges and opportunities. Microbiologists have made some of the most important scientific discoveries in this century. Since 1910, approximately one-third of the Nobel Prizes in medicine and physiology have been awarded to microbiologists. The discipline covers a wide spectrum of specialized interest areas that illustrate how microbes affect human and animal health, our environment, food safety, food technology, and the biotechnology industry. In recent years, the field of microbiology has had a major impact upon virtually all other scientific disciplines. For this reason, even students who choose to major in other fields may benefit from a minor in microbiology. Students majoring in microbiology are well prepared to enter graduate school, veterinary school, and medical school, or to establish careers in food or pharmaceutical industries, hospitals, public health agencies, universities, research laboratories, and other biomedical industries.

Upon approval, this plan of study leads to a Bachelor of University Studies (B.U.S.) degree. Students seeking the Bachelor of University Studies degree usually begin by visiting the Advising Resource Center and talking with an adviser about their long-range hopes and aspirations. The adviser will work with the student in preparing a statement of goals, a summary of previous education and experience, and a plan of study for the degree. After both have signed the proposal, it is forwarded to the Bachelor of University Studies Program Review Committee for approval. If the proposal is approved by the committee, it becomes a set of requirements for graduation. Each plan of study must meet the general education requirements and the graduation requirements of the university. The Bachelor of University Studies degree does not allow a designated major, instead a student will create an area or areas of emphasis that will help him or her attain post-graduation goals. Each area of emphasis must include a minimum of 12 credits of study with at least 6 of those credits being upper division credits. In addition to the emphasis area a student may choose to declare an academic minor that they feel will strengthen their plan of study. Degree Plan Proposal The degree plan must be submitted to the B.U.S Program Review Committee by guideline due dates (October 1 for spring or summer graduation; February 1 for fall graduation). No fewer than 15 credits must be proposed (remain to be taken after approval) and included in the proposal. Students who submit proposals after the due date will not be considered for graduation the following semester. A program must include the following: at least 15 credits of study to be completed after approval; a total of no fewer than 120 credits (including credit for military experience, previous college work, etc.); 37 credits of junior- and senior-level courses (300-400 level); a cumulative grade-point average of 2.00 based on all work completed at NDSU; 60 credits from a four-year institution; and the residency requirement (36 credits must be completed at NDSU). Ordinarily, the last 30 credits must be resident credits. In addition, each program must fulfill the General Education requirements (https://www.ndsu.edu/ registrar/academics/gened) including the Capstone Experience, Cultural Diversity and Global Perspectives categories, and have as a minimum the following: Requirements Credits Communications (C) 12174 Department of Architecture and Landscape Architecture Quantitative Reasoning (R) 3 Science & Technology (S) (A laboratory course is included in this requirement.) 10 Humanities & Fine Arts (A) 6 Social & Behavioral Sciences (B) 6 Wellness (W) 2 Capstone 3 Total Credits 42 Approval of a student's proposal means that the committee believes that the approved plan is the best educational program available to that student and that it is a baccalaureate-level program. It is the policy of the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences that students seeking a B.U.S. degree will, following approval of the B.U.S Proposal, be expected to make continual progress toward completion of their degree. Discontinuing enrollment for a period of two continuous academic years or more indicates lack of progress. The approved proposals of students who lack progress will no longer be considered valid for graduation with a B.U.S. degree. If these students choose to continue to seek a B.U.S. degree, it will be necessary to submit a new proposal for consideration by the committee. In addition to the Bachelor of University Studies' continual progress policy, NDSU requires that any student who discontinues enrollment for more than one year is subject to completing the General Education requirements in effect at the time of re-entry. B.U.S. proposals are subject to the NDSU baccalaureate degree requirements. For further information, contact: Advising Resource Center 112 Morrill Hall NDSU Dept. 2800, P.O.

We prepare students to be design leaders who will impact the built environment in a creative and sustainable manner. Architecture Accreditation In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture offered by institutions with U.S. regional accreditation, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted an eight-year, three-year, or two-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards.North Dakota State University 175 Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may require a pre-professional undergraduate degree in architecture for admission. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree. North Dakota State University's Architecture program offers the following NAAB-accredited degree program: M.Arch. (pre-professional degree + 32 graduate credits) Next accreditation visit: 2018 Landscape Architecture Accreditation The five-year Bachelors of Landscape Architecture (BLA) is accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB). The Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB) accreditation process evaluates each program on the basis of its stated objectives and compliance to externally mandated minimum standards. The program conducts a self-study to evaluate how well it is meeting its educational goals. LAAB then provides an independent assessment, which determines if a program meets accreditation requirements. Accreditation is a non-governmental, voluntary system of self-regulation. Its core is the concept of self-evaluation. The BLA Program was last accredited in 2014 and is scheduled for re-accreditation in 2019. The pending Masters of Landscape Architecture will be reviewed in the fall of 2018. Facilities The classrooms, studios, and laboratories are well equipped and every effort is made to keep them abreast of current technology. Student Societies and Organizations Students are eligible to join one or more of these organizations which are actively supported for the benefit of students in the related curricula: American Institute of Architecture Students American Society of Landscape Architects In addition, national professional honor societies have chapters on campus for students with high academic attainments. Eligible students are selected for Tau Sigma Delta from architecture or Sigma Lambda Alpha from landscape architecture. Membership in these societies is a coveted honor and highly regarded in the architectural professions. Architecture (p. 175) Landscape Architecture (p. 178) Architecture The architect must combine an understanding of society, artistic skill, and technological knowledge to shape places and spaces that enrich human life. Not only do the physical requirements need to be satisfied, but also there must be beauty to engage the human spirit. All of this requires a creative thought process that can balance and organize needs that are quite varied in nature. Clear, responsible, sensitive, and comprehensive thinking is demanded of the architect who is to integrate a wide range of factors into a design that is meaningful. For this reason an architect's education must range from the practical aspects of building construction to the study of environmental, social, and aesthetic issues. Central to the study of architecture is the sequence of architectural studio courses. Students are assigned architectural problems, which may be hypothetical, realistic, or theoretical, and find their own solutions to them with frequent individual consultations with instructors. As the student progresses, the projects become larger and more complex or the solution becomes more detailed. In this way, knowledge and experience acquired in other classes are brought to bear on the principal responsibility of the architect and the architecture student, that of shaping separate considerations into a single design. Selective Admission Admission into the first-year pre-architecture program is open to any student enrolled at NDSU. Transfer students are evaluated on the basis of courses taken and grades received. Upon completion of the first year, a selected number of students are admitted to the second year of the program on the basis of institutional GPA attained and performance in first-year environmental design courses. The Program At the end of the third year of study, students may apply to the Master of Architecture degree program. The Bachelor of Science in Architecture is granted after the fourth year of study, and the professional Master of Architecture degree at the end of the fifth year of study. The program is fully accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board, and the M.Arch. degree is recognized by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards as a professional degree. The total number of credits required for the professional degree is 168, and the bachelor degree requirement is 136.176 Architecture Special Notice Students who are admitted into the second year of the program will be required to purchase a laptop computer before the beginning of the spring semester. Information on type of computer, software, purchase, and financing arrangements will be distributed to admitted students prior to purchase.

The curriculum is reviewed periodically by the nationally organized Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board and has been fully accredited since 1991. Landscape architects provide a wide variety of professional services for individual clients, organizations, corporations, and government agencies. They are involved at every phase of the development of a site, from the initial discussion of ideas with the client through the supervision of construction for the project. Master planning of parks, zoos, golf courses, playgrounds, and recreation areas are familiar projects for landscape architects. They may also design multifunctional areas for urban renewal projects, college campuses, industrial parks, new communities, natural areas, reclaimed lands, and wetlands. Besides designing sites, landscape architects often select building locations, prepare cost estimates, initiate long-range planning studies, determine utility corridors, and prepare environmental impact statements for future construction. Whether specializing within a large firm of landscape architects or working in a small professional office, the landscape architect is often collaborating with other professionals, such as engineers, city planners, and architects. Most landscape architects spend some of their time at the drawing board or computer. They also spend many hours in the field, investigating and analyzing potential project sites, developing field notes for design layouts, completing visual surveys, and supervising construction. It is at the computerNorth Dakota State University 179 and drawing board that projects are actually organized and shaped into a creative and imaginative solution. The work and responsibility of each landscape architect depends principally on individual interests and abilities. Opportunities may range from professional practice on a small scale to administration of governmental programs. Those who plan careers in landscape architecture should be able to work independently, have a capacity for solving technical problems, be artistically inclined, and be willing to learn computer use. They should be prepared to work in the competitive environment of the profession, where great value is placed on leadership and the ability to work effectively with others. The range of interests and knowledge required in the profession of landscape architecture is broad; therefore, the courses required of students include many fields of study options. Selective Admission Admission into the first-year Pre-Landscape Architecture program is open to any student enrolled at NDSU. Transfer students are evaluated on the basis of courses taken and grades received. Upon completion of the first year, a selected number of students are admitted to the second year of the program. The basis for selection is institutional GPA and performance in first-year environmental design courses.

Department of Emergency Management www.ndsu.edu/emgt The Department of Emergency Management offers a major and minor in Emergency Management at the undergraduate level. The minor options include Comprehensive Emergency Management, Preparedness and Response, Mitigation and Recovery, and International Emergency Management. The emergency management major prepares students to pursue interests in emergency management and related fields at both the practitioner and graduate study level. The major is ideally-suited for students seeking emergency management as a career of first choice. The program utilizes a four- prong approach to build successful graduates: 1. Provide an educational foundation that supports graduates' entry into different settings where emergency management is practiced (e.g., government at all levels; businesses; schools and colleges; healthcare industry; non-profit organizations; humanitarian efforts; etc.); 2. Support effective practice by providing an evidence-based focus on the research and science critical to the field; 3. Promote and foster experiential opportunities through focused class activities and required internships; and, 4. Develop skills necessary to the effective practice of emergency management (e.g., communication; collaboration; teamwork; leadership; critical thinking; problem-solving; etc.). Emergency management students are required to complete an internship. The internship experience is intended to allow students to combine the theoretical and applied aspects of emergency management. Internships are designed to meet each individual student's career goals. As such, internship opportunities are as varied as students' career goals and can include working in a variety of settings locally, nationally, or internationally. Internships have proven to be an essential element in student development and a key factor in successful job placement. An emergency management degree prepares students for career opportunities across all sectors, all industries, and all locations. The emergency management function, while structured in a variety of ways in different government, private sector, and non-profit organizations, plays an essential role in maintaining safe and secure operations that protect the entity's interests. Career opportunities in emergency management exist at all levels of government, across all government agencies, in all developing countries; private sector companies as both a site-based and corporate function; public schools and higher education institutions; hospital and healthcare facilities; non-profit organizations as part of a primary disaster mission or general operational mission; critical infrastructure industries; museums, malls, stadiums, and event centers; and, other organizations or entities that manage facilities or services subject to hazards or operational interruptions that can result in harm to individuals, property, or the organization. Emergency Management (p. 206) Emergency Management Emergency Management Major Admission to the Emergency Management undergraduate major at NDSU requires students to satisfy several curriculum requirements. Each requirement must be satisfied in order to be admitted to the program. Prior to admission, students will be listed in the pre-professional program if they indicate Emergency Management as their major. All students in the pre-professional program are strongly encouraged to seek out their advisor each semester to ensure that they are satisfying these guidelines. Requirements: 1.Complete a formal application and submit to Academic Assistant in Minard 428. The application is available online at https://www.ndsu.edu/emgt or in the main office of the Department of Emergency Management. Admission applications are processed on a rolling basis. This means that students can apply at any time and the department will review them within 30 days of application. 2.The student must have completed a minimum of 12 credit hours at NDSU upon application. 3.The student must have achieved a minimum GPA of 2.50 in all coursework (transfer and NDSU) and a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 in all Emergency Management prefix (EMGT) courses at the time of application. 4.Must have completed EMGT 101 Emergencies, Disasters and Catastrophes with a grade of \"B\" or better or have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher in all Emergency Management courses taken.North Dakota State University 207 5.A grade of \"D\" in an Emergency Management course will result in that course not counting toward the major. One retake to remediate a \"D\" grade is allowed. 6.Failure to maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 in Emergency Management prefix courses while in the program will result in an academic warning for the first violation and administrative removal from the program for the second violation. Students facing administrative removal may draft an appeal letter for review by the full department if the student feels that there are extenuating circumstances that would merit consideration. 7.Internal and external transfer students will be handled similarly to students who commence their studies in the pre-professional program. External transfer students having Emergency Management courses from other institutions of higher education will not have the GPA for those courses counted in their NDSU Emergency Management major GPA. Emergency Management Minor The Department of Emergency Management offers a minor with a variety of options to enhance the educational background and career opportunities for students from various majors. The Comprehensive Emergency Management option covers all of the disaster phases and includes an elective course. The Preparedness and Response option focuses on those activities that compliment majors related to planning activities and responder engagements. An additional two elective courses round out this minor. The Mitigation and Recovery option focuses on structural as well as social and behavioral aspects of minimizing disaster impacts as well as recovering from them. Courses that deepen the student's knowledge of these functions are included in the elective category. The International Emergency Management option covers the disaster phases of response and recovery as they typically involve collaboration and intervention from international partners. Specific international issues courses and electives are also included in this minor. Major Requirements Major: Emergency Management Degree Type: B.A. or B.S.

The department is committed to pursuing excellence in scholarship and teaching in all of its many areas of specialization. Our outstanding faculty and students specialize in a wide variety of historical, contemporary, and global themes that reflect the human condition. As a Department in the College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences, the NDSU Department of History, Philosophy, and Religious Studies has over 200 undergraduate majors, and serves thousands of students across the university.

History (p. 217) Public History (p. 222) Philosophy-Humanities (p. 220) Religious Studies (p. 225) Social Science (p. 225) History History Major By engaging in the fascinating study of how people in the past understood their worlds, graduates from the Department of History, Philosophy, and Religious Studies will be prepared to comprehend and think critically about the present by understanding how it has been shaped by the past. In their studies they will learn how to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of alternative explanations for historical events, how to interpret primary and secondary materials to form valid conclusions, how to analyze components of historical events, and how to synthesize and apply their knowledge in an original research project. The Department of History, Philosophy, and Religious Studies offers both a B.A. and a B.S. degree in History. The B.A. degree requires the completion of two years of a modern language at the college level and is recommended for students desiring a rich liberal arts education or planning for graduate school or law school (see Bachelor of Arts Requirement using a Second Language (p. 64)). The B.S. degree does not have a modern language requirement but, instead, requires an appropriate minor. Students transferring to NDSU must complete at least 50 percent of their history credits at North Dakota State University. A History Education program of study also is offered between the Department of History, Philosophy, and Religious Studies and the School of Education (https://www.ndsu.edu/education) .

Philosophy-Humanities Through interdisciplinary study, students develop an awareness and understanding of the major events and ideas that have shaped the civilization in which they live. Philosophy-Humanities Major People have always had questions about the world in which they live. Whether these questions are about truth, beauty, and goodness, or about whether life has any meaning, people find questions to ask. Over the centuries, many minds have addressed these questions. By means of dialogue, intuition, logic, and critical thought, philosophers have created pathways to wisdom and an understanding of the human condition. North Dakota State University offers students a Philosophy curriculum that may be approached either as a Philosophy-Humanities major or minor. The Philosophy-Humanities major consists of 32 semester credits. Of these, 21 credits must be taken from the required courses. Eleven elective credits, which can be independent studies, complete the major. Each degree has additional university and College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences requirements that must be fulfilled.

Total Credits 34-38 Department of Modern Languages www.ndsu.edu/modernlanguages Today's interconnected world generates the need to be able to communicate in more than one language. As networks of international cooperation and exchange grow in complexity, particularly among governments and businesses, those who possess foreign language competence become increasingly valuable. Moreover, it has been shown that learning a second language can improve one's overall writing and speaking ability. The Department of Modern Languages offers major programs in French and Spanish, and courses in German. Study Abroad and the experience of living in another culture are an integral part of majoring in languages at North Dakota State University. Through the Tri-College University consortium (p. 829), NDSU students may also study Chinese, Japanese, Norwegian, and classics for full credit. In addition, degree programs in French Education and Spanish Education are offered between the Department of Modern Languages and the School of Education (https://www.ndsu.edu/education) . Language Placement Students must adhere to the placement requirements when enrolling in a language course for the first time at NDSU. If, after appropriate placement, the student's instructor recommends that because of exceptional circumstances the student should be placed at a lower level, full credit at the new level may be granted. Credit for Advanced Language Placement A student placed at an advanced level may receive NDSU credit for those courses waived, upon fulfillment of the following conditions: 1.The student has completed no previous college-level credit in that language; 2.The student enrolls consecutively in at least two courses within the same level, i.e., 201-202, (intermediate); 311-312, (advanced); and receives grades of 'B' or better, (courses may not be taken pass/fail); 3.The student submits a petition form obtained from the Department of Modern Languages (https://www.ndsu.edu/modernlanguages) , signed by the instructor and the department chair. Major and Minor Programs Language majors and minors may be obtained in French and Spanish. German courses are available through the third-year level. Both the French and Spanish majors consist of a minimum of 28 credits above the intermediate level. At least nine of these credits must be in advanced language; the remainder may be chosen from a variety of courses in linguistics, literature, and culture. A minimum of one year of a second foreign language at NDSU, or the equivalent, is required. French and Spanish majors must earn a minimum grade of a 'B' for courses in the major, including credits received for study abroad. Junior and senior year course work will be determined in consultation with a faculty adviser according to the student's background and interests. A minor necessitates completion of a minimum of 18 credits beyond the intermediate level. At least nine of these credits must be in advanced language (normally conversation/composition). Career Directions Experience has shown that many students, with or without declared modern language majors or minors, find a second language background especially useful when combined with preparation in another professional field. Examples include public relations, journalism, TV and radio broadcasting, hotel management, publishing and editing, government service, banking, and management. One of the more promising occupational fields for language students has been international business. Individuals with foreign language skills are finding increased opportunities with multinational corporations, especially in management and marketing. Many companies with international ties recruit candidates possessing linguistic training because they recognize its correlation with effective verbal and written communication. Regardless of their specific majors, students are encouraged to contact the department for information and advice on career application of foreign language skills. Students wishing to prepare for high school teaching should make this intention known to the School of Education (https://www.ndsu.edu/education) and to the Department of Modern Languages (https://www.ndsu.edu/modernlanguages) to make certain that the requirements for state certification are met. Competitiveness and flexibility in the job market tend to be greater if certification can be obtained in two or more different areas.228 French French (p. 228) German Language Studies (p. 231) Spanish (p. 231) French Today's interconnected world generates the need to be able to communicate in more than one language.

Challey School of Music www.ndsu.edu/performingarts/ NDSU Challey School of Music prepares students for careers in teaching, performance, and related liberal studies. It also provides creative opportunities for all talented student musicians regardless of major, and seeks to foster an appreciation of music throughout the greater NDSU community. NDSU is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music. Programs of study lead to the Bachelor of Music with options in Performance and Music Education; the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science in Music; the Master of Music with options in Performance, Conducting, and Music Education; and the Doctor of Musical Arts with options in Performance and Conducting. Majors/Minors Admission to music major or minor programs is arranged through an audition and interview; for information, please contact the Division of Performing Arts (https://www.ndsu.edu/performingarts) office. All undergraduate music majors take private lessons, participate in ensembles, and take a broad range of courses appropriate to their areas of emphasis. All music courses must be passed with a grade of 'C' or better. A performance achievement jury must be passed prior to registration in 300-level applied study. The Bachelor of Music degree in Performance is for talented vocalists and instrumentalists who wish a career as a professional performer or conductor, and who will likely continue their studies in graduate school. The Bachelor of Music degree with certification in Music Education is for students who wish to teach K-12 music in North Dakota's public schools. Certification requirements for other states varies, but North Dakota licensure is congruent with that of many other states. Experiences in a broad spectrum of music education courses\u2014elementary, instrumental, and voice/choral\u2014results in NDSU's outstanding reputation for producing teachers with excellent and versatile credentials. Music majors pursuing a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree (without public school teaching certification) are generally interested in a broad liberal arts education with a significant number of electives. Music majors and minors supplement their course work by attending recitals and concerts. Those in applied study perform for the jury examination at the end of each semester. Students enrolled in private applied study also participate in a related major ensemble; pianists sometimes play with chamber ensembles or accompany large ensembles. Ensembles The NDSU Challey School of Music sponsors a large variety of ensembles including the NDSU Wind Symphony, Concert Choir, University Symphony Orchestra, Madrigal Singers, two large Jazz Ensembles, Jazz Combos, the Gold Star Marching Band, Brass Ensemble, University Chamber Singers, NDSU Statesmen, Cantemus, University Band, Bison Pep Bands, NDSU Opera Theatre, and chamber ensembles in typical instrumental and vocal combinations. The Concert Choir, Wind Symphony, Jazz Ensemble, Madrigal Singers and several other groups have touring programs, some of which are national or international in scope. Participation in these ensembles is open to all students, some by audition and some as open-enrollment ensembles. Music Curricula Requirements are grouped by degree. Please refer also to graduation requirements listed in the Academic Policies (p. 30) section of this publication.

Students gain practical experiences through Theatre - NDSU which reflect the best of professional practices and current technology. In addition to academic course work, every theatre major is required to participate in some way in at least one Theatre - NDSU production per semester. Participation in Theatre - NDSU is open to all NDSU students regardless of major. The Department of Theatre Arts is accredited by the National Association of Theatre Schools (NAST)),and hosts a student chapter of the United States Institute for Theatre Technology (USITT). The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) with a major in Theatre Arts are general baccalaureate degrees providing a liberal arts background with major emphasis in theatre. The Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) with a major in Theatre Arts is a professionally-oriented program and can be entered only by audition. This degree program provides in-depth study of a theatre specialization: Performance, Musical Theatre, or Design/ Technology. A minor in Theatre Arts is available with a general studies emphasis, dance emphasis, or with selected electives a student could design a minor with an emphasis either in theatrical design and technical theatre, or in performance (acting and directing). A student who wishes to teach theatre in high school should select a teaching major approved by the School of Education (https://www.ndsu.edu/ education) and compliment that major with a major or minor in Theatre Arts. Courses for Theatre Arts majors and minors are grouped into tracks and emphasis areas. Theatre Arts (p. 259) Theatre Arts There are three undergraduate degree programs in theatre. Each is flexible and can be designed to fit the individual student's career goals: The Bachelor of Arts in theatre arts is a general baccalaureate degree built around a traditional liberal arts curriculum. Within the major field itself, courses are required in technical theatre, performing, and directing, as well as in literature and theatre history. The BA program requires two years' study of a modern language. The Bachelor of Science degree is an alternative to the Bachelor of Arts. The program for the BS is identical to that for the BA, except that the BS requires a minor in an approved field, in place of study of a modern language. The Bachelor of Fine Arts is a professionally-oriented undergraduate degree track which places primary emphasis on performance and studio activity, while also requiring a high level of involvement in the academic curriculum. It can be entered only by faculty permission. This degree track broadens the student's exposure to his/her field--Performance, Design & Tech, Musical Theatre--and considerable study is made of related fine arts fields as well. Admission to the BFA degree program requires consistent involvement in Theatre NDSU productions and projects and demands a high level of commitment on the part of the student. The Department of Theatre Arts is fully accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre (NAST). The department currently has 52 majors and 14 minors and is continuing to grow. B.F.A.

Women and Gender Studies www.ndsu.edu/wgs/ The goals of Women and Gender Studies include: Examining the contributions of all genders to aspects of society; exploring the intersections of race, class, sexual orientation, age, and physical ability with gender both globally and nationally; investigating the heritage, challenges and concerns of women and men; and providing a newer and broader understanding of women and men in all fields. The Women and Gender Studies program provides the benefits of a liberal arts education with an emphasis on critical thinking, writing, and organizational skills, making oral presentations, and expands the traditional acknowledgement that a liberal education produces well-rounded individuals. There also are multiple practical applications of a Women and Gender Studies major. The interdisciplinary curriculum, with an emphasis on equality and diversity, prepares students for leadership in areas such as the workplace, politics, health care, sport, families, education, and law.274 Women and Gender Studies Women and Gender Studies Major The Women and Gender Studies major consists of 36 credits, including a 21 credit core and 15 hours of elective classes. Women and Gender Studies Minor The Women and Gender Studies minor is an interdisciplinary program appropriate as a complement to various majors. This minor is particularly useful in acquiring perspectives that complement traditional studies for developing leadership roles or for pursuing careers that involve concerns about gender.

See the Graduate Bulletin (p. 531) for more information. Accounting (p. 279) Finance (p. 283) Fraud Investigation (p. 198) Management Information Systems (p. 287) Accounting Accounting Major Accounting is a profession that deals with providing financial information used in making business decisions. Accounting involves a range of skills that includes collecting, measuring, interpreting, analyzing, and communicating financial activity. A major in Accounting focuses on the development of such skills along with an understanding of the legal, social, and ethical responsibilities involved in the accounting profession. Financial accountants prepare financial statements used in investing and lending decisions. Auditors examine financial statements and attest to their status. Management accountants evaluate and communicate internal financial information used by managers to operate a business. Forensic accountants specialize in the investigation and detection of, and protection against, fraud and abuse. Accountants also provide tax advisory services to firms, clients, and governmental agencies. With their specialized knowledge concerning the internal operation of a business, many accountants provide management advisory services. Also, because of the specialized knowledge, many accountants advance into management positions. Students majoring in Accounting are required to learn how to apply technology in business and must take courses in many other aspects of business to understand how an accountant's work relates to marketing, management, finance, and production. This four-year program leads to a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Accounting. Completion of this program qualifies students to take the examinations required to become a Certified Management Accountant (CMA), Certified Internal Auditor (CIA), and Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE). Students interested in sitting for the Certified Public Accounting (CPA) exam need an additional 28 credit hours beyond the 122 credit hours required for the Accounting major. Students are encouraged to satisfy the additional credit hours through the Master of Accountancy (M.Acc.) degree. Additional information about the M.Acc. program can be found in the Graduate Bulletin (p. 531) online.280 Accounting Accounting Minor Students earning majors in other fields may select a minor in Accounting. A minor includes ACCT 200 Elements of Accounting I , ACCT 201 Elements of Accounting II , ACCT 311 Intermediate Accounting I , and ACCT 320 Cost Management Systems , plus six credits in approved accounting courses. In addition, students must earn a 2.50 cumulative grade-point average in the accounting courses to be awarded a minor. A minor approval form is required and can be found at www.ndsu.edu/business.

Management Information Systems Management Information Systems Major Management Information Systems concerns the collection, organization, analysis, and dissemination of information for the planning and control of business/organizational operations. The Management Information Systems (MIS) program is designed for students who wish to prepare for professional careers in information processing or information systems in business and government. The program is designed to develop technical skills and administrative insights required for design, development, implementation, maintenance, and management of organizational information systems. The MIS program at NDSU is a collaborative effort by the faculty of two disciplines: Management Information Systems and Computer Science. The objective is to provide students with both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience. In addition to the required courses in management information systems and computer science, majors must complete a practicum in the management information systems area. Students pursuing an MIS major typically earn a Computer Science minor. The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree provides sufficient background and skills to support a successful career in technical computing (for example, programmer, systems analyst, or systems designer), systems or network administration, database administration, information technology management, sales, or technical sales support. Management Information Systems Minor The Management Information Systems minor is intended for students who are planning careers that involve more active roles as computer users and evaluators, designers, and/or builders of information systems. The minor will provide exposure to issues relevant to the management of information technologies and the means to achieve organizational goals. Contact the Department of Accounting, Finance, and Information Systems for specific course and minimum grade point average requirements.

Study Abroad Requirement ***3 Total Credits 40-51 *The intent of BUSN 341 is to ensure that students participate in a study abroad experience that includes an academic component related to the country where the study abroad takes place. In addition to BUSN 341 (business environment, institutions, history, and cultures of the European Union) BUSN 394: Individual Study (business environment, institutions, history, and culture of China) may also fulfill this requirement. NDSU Study Tour (Prefix 379) courses from across campus (faculty directed experience or field study in a foreign country) or other study abroad transfer courses approved by the department chair may also fulfill this requirement. While these courses will fulfill the academic requirement portion of the study abroad experience, the student must study abroad for at least three weeks as described in study abroad footnote***. ** A second year language proficiency at the college-level is required. Completion of any 300 or 400 level language course with a grade of B or higher will also fulfill this requirement. For non-native English speakers, completion of any 300 or 400 level ENGL course (this includes ENGL 320) with a grade of B or higher will fulfill this requirement. Second Year Language Proficiency includes: (Prefix) 101: First Year Language I (Prefix) 102: First Year Language II (Prefix) 201: Second Year Language I (Prefix) 202: Second Year Language II ***Each student must complete an approved study abroad experience (Prefix 492). Although the core requirement of BUSN 341 or equivalent already encompasses a study abroad experience, students earning a second major in global business must study abroad for at least three weeks. In some cases, the study abroad requirement is fulfilled by one study abroad experience - e.g., a five week program in Europe or a full semester abroad. However, two shorter programs may be substituted for a longer program (e.g., the ten-day CoB spring break experience in Eastern Europe and the twelve-day CoB summer trip to China). notes International students who are enrolled at NDSU will not be required to complete a study abroad experience. Instead, students must complete one of the following North American history courses: HIST 382, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 429, 431, 434, 436, 437, or 476. This history course will substitute for the BUSN 341 \"European Business Environment or equivalent study abroad course\" from core requirement group A. Pre-Business Core Suggestions: While not required, students are encouraged to take either ANTH 111 (Introduction to Anthropology) or COMM 216 (Intercultural Communication) as a general education cultural diversity requirement option. Students will also benefit from taking GEOG 161 (World Regional Geography) as an elective. Management Management Major The Management major is designed to provide students with the analytical and conceptual background necessary for effective management of businesses and other organizations. Students develop expertise in the major sub-areas of organizational behavior, production and operations management, human resources, and strategy. Students with management majors find employment in all types of profit and non-profit organizations. Students pursuing a Management major may also choose the Human Resource Management track. Human Resource Management Track The Human Resource Management track provides students with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively serve in a Human Resource Management position. Students obtain knowledge in the legal environment of employment, job analysis, recruitment and selection, performance appraisals, compensation, training and labor relations.

The purpose of this program is to enable qualified undergraduate and graduate students to become commissioned officers in the United States Air Force. AFROTC learning experiences will be of long-range value whether one pursues a military or civilian career. Upon graduation and completion of the AFROTC curriculum, each student is commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force. The initial assignment options available to the Air Force second lieutenant include the following: 1.Enter the Air Force and complete the designated technical training course prerequisite to the student's specialty, i.e., flight training, research and development, management, or support functions. 2.Apply for a delay in entering active duty for the purpose of pursuing an advanced degree. 3.Enroll in one of several Air Force sponsored graduate study programs while serving with full pay as an Air Force officer. The Aerospace Studies curriculum is divided into two courses of instruction: the General Military Course (GMC), which parallels the freshman and sophomore academic years, and the Professional Officer Course (POC), which parallels the junior and senior academic years. Students in the four-year program normally attend four weeks of field training at Maxwell AFB, AL during the summer between their sophomore and junior years. The student who chooses not to enroll in the GMC (first two years) may still earn a commission by enrolling in a special two-year program during the junior and senior years. Admission to this special program requires the student to make application early in the sophomore year. Qualified students will then participate in a six-week field-training program at an Air Force base the summer prior to their junior or senior year. AFROTC college scholarships are awarded to the best-qualified students and range in length from one to five years. These grants cover the cadet's tuition, incidental lab fees and most textbooks. In addition, cadets receive a tiered monthly allowance. For example, cadets enrolled in the Professional Officer Corps (POC) receive $450 per month during their junior academic year and $500 per month during their senior academic year. Incentive scholarships also are available for students not already on scholarship.

Students began to be enrolled in the program in the fall semester of 1970. The Construction Management and Engineering (CM&E) Department was established at NDSU in 1978. In 1988, the Department was merged as a fully autonomous \"Division\" within Civil Engineering. The Civil Engineering Department was renamed as the Department of Civil Engineering and Construction. This structure remained in place until 2005, however, the construction programs were administered independently of Civil Engineering through the Division of Construction Management and Engineering. In 2005, the present Department of Construction Management and Engineering was established. Within the Department, the Program of Bachelor of Science in Construction Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the ABET (http://www.abet.org) . It is the third oldest Bachelor of Science in Construction Engineering program in the United States. The Program of Bachelor of Science in Construction Management is accredited by the American Council for Construction Education (http://www.acce- hq.org).

The construction of such projects requires the knowledge of engineering, management, economics, and business. Construction Engineering is differentiated from Construction Management from the standpoint of the use of math, science, and engineering to design projects and processes and analyze problems. Construction Engineering is involved in a variety of construction disciplines, including: commercial, residential, transportation, and infrastructure systems. Construction Engineers are also involved in the engineering design of temporary structures, cost estimating, planning and scheduling, material procurement, selection of equipment, and cost control. Due to their diverse skills, there is a very high demand for Construction Engineers. The Department of Construction Management and Engineering offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Construction Engineering which offers a blend of engineering and construction courses. The program is designed for those who want to work in the construction industry and enjoy the status of a professional engineer. A thorough knowledge of the physical sciences, math, and engineering is developed during the first two years followed by construction management and engineering courses. The technical side of the program is balanced with requirements in writing, humanities, social science, and communications. The Bachelor of Science degree in Construction Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the ABET (http://www.abet.org) . Educational Objectives The Educational Objectives of the Construction Engineering Degree Program describe the career and professional accomplishments that we expect our graduates to achieve early in their careers. Within the first few (3-5) years after graduation, we expect our alumni: To maintain a sustained program of continuing education and life-long learning with a focus on contemporary issues.

Army ROTC gives students the opportunity to become involved in a unique program that adds the leadership dimension to their college education. It also provides several financial assistance options. Students, regardless of their majors, are eligible to participate in this program. The primary objective of the program is to provide the knowledge and skills required for men and women to serve as commissioned officers in the active Army, Army Reserve, or Army National Guard. NDSU's Military Science Department is seeking students who have leadership potential, particularly those who are scholars, athletes, and leaders. The Army ROTC program is a multi-year program of instruction in the military sciences taken in conjunction with an academic program curriculum. Advanced placement credit may be received for previous or current military service. The program requires a minimum of 19 credit hours and leads to a minor in Military Science. The program is divided into two parts: the basic course and the advanced course. The basic course is normally taken during the freshman and sophomore years. Students participating in the basic course incur no military obligation or commitment. Instruction offered in the basic course includes: physical fitness class, military leadership and management, land navigation, U.S. military history, first aid, tactics, and drill and ceremonies. Military skills laboratories also are offered. These include adventure activities such as rappelling, rope bridging, tactics, military equipment use, drill and ceremony, survival techniques, and a leadership reaction course. Students entering the advanced course must have a minimum of two years of academic work remaining in a curriculum leading to either a baccalaureate or graduate degree. Students may qualify for entry into the advanced course by one of the following: completing the basic course, completing basic training, attending the 29-day Basic Camp, or having prior military service in any of the armed forces of the United States. Members of the Army National Guard or Army Reserve may qualify for direct entry into the advanced course and can maintain membership in their Guard/Reserve Unit by enrolling in the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP) option. Advanced course students receive instruction in advanced leadership and management and are afforded the opportunity to apply their acquired knowledge to practical situations. Military skills laboratories also are offered. In addition to the listed military science curriculum, advanced course students must complete an approved course in written communication skills, military history, and computer literacy. Most basic students attend a 29-day Basic Camp between the first and second year of the basic course. Advanced Cadets attend a 29-day Advanced Camp between the first and second year of the advanced course. Both of these courses are held at Ft. Knox, Kentucky (near Louisville). The Advanced Camp is designed to develop and evaluate a student's judgment and decision-making abilities, build physical endurance and self-confidence, and allow a student to apply leadership skills. Leadership positions are rotated among the students so that each person experiences firsthand what it takes to apply leadership skills and develop an organization. Students are also able to apply for internships and trips abroad. Four-, three-, and two-year Army ROTC scholarships are available, which provide for payment of tuition and fees. Students receive $600 per semester for books and equipment, and an allowance of $350 to $500 per month for each year the scholarship is in effect. Generally, four-year scholarships are awarded to high school students who wish to compete during their senior year for a scholarship, but college freshmen also have been awarded this highly desirable scholarship. Students who do not qualify for the ROTC program or who do not wish to pursue an officer's commission may audit courses in the advanced ROTC program and if they have enough credits can receive a Military Science Minor, if approved by the professor of military science. Auditing student's participation is limited to the classroom and they are not eligible for monetary allowances.North Dakota State University 347 For detailed information on the Army ROTC program, contact the Department of Military Science, 1-800-798-7575 or 231-7575, Room 103 Bentson/ Bunker Fieldhouse (https://www.ndsu.edu/alphaindex/buildings/Building::351) or the department web site at www.ndsuarmyrotc.com (http:// www.ndsuarmyrotc.com) .

Program The Pharmacy program encompasses both the basic and clinical sciences and is designed to provide students with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes essential to the practice of pharmacy. Pharmacists work in concert with the patient and other health care providers to promote health and prevent diseases. This is achieved by assessing, monitoring, initiating and modifying patients' medication therapy to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes. The pharmacy curriculum consists of a four year professional program leading to the Pharm.D. degree. Students enter the program in pre-pharmacy upon meeting general admission standards of the university and must satisfy all required pre-pharmacy coursework prior to beginning the professional program. Students are admitted to the final four professional years on a competitive basis, and must meet specific admission requirements of the college. The program leads to a Doctor of Pharmacy degree (Pharm.D.). For admission requirements to the professional program, contact the Dean's Office of the college. Students attending other institutions must maintain frequent contact with the college to determine appropriate course work. The pre-pharmacy course work may be completed at other institutions if course work has been submitted for formal NDSU review and determined to be equivalent to NDSU requirements. The current entry-level Pharm.D. curriculum is designed to produce graduates with the professional competencies necessary to enter pharmacy practice in any setting to ensure optimal medication therapy outcomes and patient safety, and to satisfy the educational requirements for licensure as a pharmacist. The Pharm.D. degree prepares the student to accept positions in community, hospital, managed care, clinical, and industrial pharmacy.North Dakota State University 369 Other potential opportunities include administrative positions in pharmaceutical companies and associations. Teaching and research positions in universities and the pharmaceutical industry are excellent opportunities for those with advanced training in pharmacy.

Hospitality and Tourism Management (HTM); and Interior Design (ID). Our programs are professionally based with elements of design, technology, and management interlaced into the coursework. Our programs have a strong general education component and specialized career preparation. Programs Apparel, Retail Merchandising and Design (ARMD) Two options are available within ARMD: Apparel Studies or Retail Merchandising . Apparel Studies focuses on developing, designing, and marketing materials and products within this global industry. Graduates have accepted positions in product development, technical design, fashion journalism, quality control, and museum collection management. Retail merchandising provides students with a firm grasp of retail business strategy. Graduates hold positions as buyers, store managers, visual merchandisers, marketing managers, sales, stylists, and account executives, and trend forecasters with many retail companies. ARMD also offers a minor. Hospitality and Tourism Management (HTM) The Hospitality and Tourism Management major prepares students to be professionals who can lead teams of people and effectively manage hospitality operations in a variety of segments such as lodging, foodservice, events, travel, and tourism. Our students learn and develop leadership skills by completing coursework that increases knowledge of the industry, develops people management skills, and enhances problem-solving abilities while instilling a sense of responsibility and professionalism.

Interior Design (ID) The Interior Design major is a professional program that prepares students for a career as an interior designer. Professional interior designers create functional, safe, and attractive interior environments, including those found in restaurants, hospitals, museums, shopping centers and homes. Successful designers know the theory and science of design, drawing and computer-aided design, safety regulations, and how to read construction drawings. Our program provides coursework and experiences that develop these skills and is accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA).North Dakota State University 379 For more information about any of the programs, contact the department. We advise new students to contact the department prior to beginning their college work. Enrichment Opportunities Experiential Learning Course work in the department includes hands-on experiences through labs, studio classes, and simulations. Our programs also supplement classroom learning through structured field experiences to hospitality operations, fashion, retail, and design centers. Study tours to cities such as, Los Angeles, New York City, Minneapolis, Chicago, and to several countries, such as England, France, the Netherlands, and Italy, are scheduled regularly. Student Organizations All three majors in the ADHM Department host active student organizations. The student organizations provide students with extra opportunities outside the classroom such as industry speakers, field trips to view workplaces, chances to work on service-learning projects to help others, and the experience of planning large events related to their field of interest. ARMD students participate in the Fashion and Business Organization (FABO). In addition, they plan and implement a spring fashion show for the whole campus. The HTM student organization is the Hospitality Student Association (HSA). Their biggest event each year is the Food and Wine Show, which they organize and implement each spring as a fundraiser. The money earned goes toward a scholarship fund, some is used to defray costs of a field trip and the remainder is used for activities, special projects, and meetings for the following year. The ID student organization is the student chapter of the national professional organization, the American Society of Interior Design (ASID). Students participate in local and regional design events that include the annual North Dakota Interior Designers' Showcase. They compete biennially in Canstruction\u00ae to support the regional food bank. These students plan a trip to a place of interest each year. They have gone to Minneapolis and Chicago in recent years. Fashion Institute of Technology Affiliation Professional enrichment is possible through departmental affiliation with the Fashion Institute of Technology (F. I. T.). The department has an arrangement with the F.I.T., New York City, where a qualified student may attend that institution for a semester or a full year as a visiting student. The approved credits earned at F.I.T. will transfer to NDSU and will count toward graduation requirements. Students participating in the one-year visiting student program earn an associate degree from F.I.T.

The course of study in interior design leads to a first professional degree. Students pursue courses in which creative and technical skills are applied within a structure to achieve the built interior environment. Design solutions are functional, enhance the quality of life of occupants, and are aesthetically attractive while adhering to code and regulatory information. Design solutions produce, protect, and enhance the health, safety and welfare of the public. Students learn how to approach design problems through a methodology that includes data gathering, product specification, identification of details, contractual documents, and design business procedures. The first two years of the program introduces the fundamentals of design, visual and technical communication techniques (including drafting, CADD, perspective drawing, model building and rendering), and theoretical and practical applications (including anthropometrics, ergonomics, interior design technology, interior materials, and color theory). The interior design profession is exceedingly complex, and collaborating with design professionals and related disciplines in a team approach to problem solving is routine practice. Upper-division course work is focused on a series of integrated studio experiences and supports courses including history, professional practice, building information modeling, and interior systems. The studio experience culminates in a capstone project. Studio experiences require that each student be exposed to a variety of projects at several different levels of complexity and different client project goals. NDSU interior design students are required to complete a field experience between the third and fourth year of the program. Students accept a variety of positions throughout the United States. In the past few years students have completed field experiences in cities such as Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Denver, New York, and Shanghai (China). Laptop computers are required equipment for all first-year students beginning the spring semester. These computers need to be built to operate industry specific programs. Refer to the interior design program website for computer specifications (https://www.ndsu.edu/adhm/interior-design/ equipment.html) . Admission into second-year interior design courses requires a 3.0 institutional minimum cumulative grade-point average and a minimum grade of 'C' in all major core requirements. Admission into the second-year of the interior design program is also based on the review of a completed application and letter of intent that demonstrates professional and academic interest. This is submitted during the spring semester of the student's first year in the interior design program. Students must maintain the 3.0 institutional minimum cumulative GPA and earn a grade of 'C' or better in all major core requirements throughout the remainder of the program. Transfer students entering the interior design program should contact the program coordinator to review previously completed interior design or related course work. The interior design program at NDSU is accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation and the National Association of Schools of Art and Design.

Undergraduate majors are available in Dietetics, Exercise Science, Health Education, Physical Education, and Sport Management. Dietetics (p. 433) Exercise Science (p. 437) Health Education (p. 416) Physical Education (p. 422)North Dakota State University 433 Sport Management (p. 440) Dietetics Dietetics Major There are two options within the Dietetics major: (a) Dietitian Education Program and (b) Didactic Program. Both programs include all didactic courses required to be accredited by the The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Only graduates of ACEND-accredited programs are eligible to take the exam to become a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) or Nutrition and Dietetics Technician, Registered (NDTR). Students with a major in Dietetics are employed in many settings such as hospitals, clinics, community health programs, businesses, industries, school food services, and as consultants in homes for the elderly and other service institutions. Research and development opportunities are available in industry, government, and universities; in regulation of food quality through government agencies; and within companies as communication specialists. Note: Transfer credits in dietetics or food and nutrition from other institutions must have grades of 'C' or better to be accepted for the Dietetics program at NDSU. Dietitian Education Program (DEP) Option This option prepares professional dietetic practitioners for work in entry-level positions in hospitals, nursing homes, out-patient clinics, businesses, and community agencies. Students in the Dietitian Education Program will complete 1,200 supervised practice hours as part of the undergraduate curriculum allowing them to take the registration examination upon graduation. The Dietitian Education Program has a gerontology concentration to train students on the health concerns of the aging population. Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) Option This option meets the requirements for entrance into an accredited dietetic internship and prepares graduates for internships in hospitals, as well as in health care related organizations. After earning the BS in dietetics, graduates will need to complete the 1200 supervised practice hours (internship) in order to be eligible to take the registration exam for dietitians. Acceptance into either Dietetics program is competitive and enrollment is limited. Students who have completed the prerequisite courses apply for admission in February. The Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) accredits both program options. Major Requirements B.S.

Department of Human Development and Family Science www.ndsu.edu/hdfs The mission of the Department of Human Development and Family Science (HDFS) is to provide a comprehensive, integrated knowledge of families and individuals across the life span that will equip students for careers in the helping professions and to enter graduate programs. The curriculum emphasizes practical application, acknowledging individuals and families as developing and changing entities within a larger societal context. Human Development and Family Science (p. 443) Human Development and Family Science (Child Development option) & Elementary Education (p. 412) (Valley City State University) Human Development and Family Science (Family Science option) & Social Work (p. 450) (Minot State University) Human Development and Family Science Human Development and Family Science Major At the undergraduate level, the department offers a curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree through three options: adult development and aging; child and adolescent development; and family science. Each of these options can be completed by itself or can be paired with another degree in one of our dual degree programs. Child development can be paired with elementary education, and family science and adult development and aging can be paired with social work. Information on these dual degree programs is on a separate bulletin page. Each of the three options can also be combined with a master's degree program in one of our combined/accelerated master's programs. Child and adolescent development can be combined with the master's program in youth development; family science can be combined with the master's program in family444 Human Development and Family Science financial planning; and adult development and aging can be combined with the master's program in gerontology. Information on these combined/ accelerated degree programs is below and on separate tabs. Human Development and Family Science majors are prepared to work in a variety of areas related to children, aging adults, and families. Employment opportunities include parent and family life educators, extension agents, child protection service professionals, financial counselors, nursing home activity directors, credit specialists, and directors of child care licensing. Coursework provides students with an ecological approach to the study of human development and families with emphasis on the interactions of individuals, families, and the broader environmental context. Allowing students to select electives within the department to specialize in careers of interest provides flexibility. Note: All credits in Human Development and Family Science must have grades of 'C' or better. Adult Development and Aging Option The Adult Development & Aging option prepares students for careers involving direct and support services for adults of various ages as well as graduate studies. A minor outside the department is required. Child and Adolescent Development Option This option prepares students for careers involving direct and support services for children and adolescents as well as graduate studies. A minor outside the department is required. Family Science Option This option allows students to take a concentration of courses in family science or family economics in preparation for careers in direct and support services for families as well as graduate studies. A minor outside the department is required. Accelerated Master's Degree Options Students with a 3.5 cumulative GPA after 60 credits may apply to enter the Accelerated Master's degree program associated with their undergraduate degree option. Students in this program can complete both the bachelor's and master's degree in HDFS in only 5 years. Students in the Adult Development and Aging option may enter the master's option in Gerontology. Students in the Child and Adolescent Development option may enter the master's option in Youth Development. Students in the Family Science option may enter the master's option in Family Financial Planning. All master's degree courses are taught online, and all are charged tuition at the higher Great Plains IDEA per-credit rate (https://www.ndsu.edu/dce/degrees/ great_plains_idea_program_tuition_fees/#gpideatuition) . However, under the accelerated program, students pay less tuition overall than they would if they completed each degree in separate programs. Human Development and Family Science Minor The Human Development and Family Science minor is especially appropriate for students majoring in the social or behavioral sciences and other students planning careers that involve work with people. The minor requires 18 credits, including HDFS 135 (Family Science), HDFS 230 (Lifespan Development), and 12 credits of HDFS electives. Of the 12 credits of electives, at least nine credits must be upper division (i.e., 300 or 400 level) and no more than three credits may be in field experience ( HDFS 496 ).

This includes both NDSU and transferred coursework. College General Education Requirements College general education requirements for the two undergraduate degrees extend beyond the minimum university general education requirements (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/academics/gened) . The college requires an additional six credits in humanities and/or social sciences for the Bachelor of Science degree and an additional 12 credits for the Bachelor of Arts degree. This requirement may be fulfilled by any degree-eligible course having the following RELS, SOC, SPAN, THEA, WGS, or any course from the approved list of general education courses in humanities and social sciences (general education categories A and B). These credits must come from outside the department of the student's major. An adviser should be consulted for specific courses. Students also are encouraged to follow their own interests in choosing electives that go beyond the minimum requirements. Bachelor of Arts Degree B.A. degree requirements are the same as the B.S. degree with an additional six credits of humanities or social and behavioral sciences and the addition of two years of a modern foreign language. This means completion of the second year of college-level language or the equivalent. Refer to the Bachelor of Arts Requirement using a Second Language (p. 64) section within the Academic Degree Information (p. 33) section of the Academic Policies (p. 30). All degree candidates must apply for graduation through the Office of Registration and Records (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar) according to university procedures and deadlines.

Various curricular options are available for specific career interests. It is important for students to consult frequently with their advisers regarding the proper options and courses related to their special interests. In addition, students should correspond early with professional or graduate schools to make sure they satisfy specific requirements. Curricula for secondary school biological sciences education, comprehensive science education, environmental studies, traditional course sequences, and pre-professional programs are available in the department. Graduate work in biology is offered at the Master of Science level. Students interested in majoring in a specific biological science (animal science, botany, entomology, horticulture, microbiology, plant pathology, or zoology) should consult the appropriate discipline. Biological Sciences (p. 462) Botany (p. 467)462 Biological Sciences Zoology (p. 468) Biological Sciences A Biological Sciences degree is available in a traditional broad-based sequence or in an Environmental Science option. Biological Sciences Standard Option Biological Sciences is a comprehensive field of biology that prepares students for a variety of careers in human health, environmental science, conservation, and plant and animal biology. With its many areas of emphasis, the program integrates studies in zoology, botany, and biological sciences and offers students the flexibility to customize their field of study to align course selection with educational and professional goals. The program integrates broad-based biology foundation classes with specializations such as biomedical science or conservation biology, in later years. With appropriate course selection, the Biological Sciences degree also can provide a broad understanding of the complex relationship between the living and nonliving world. Students will be able to choose a research based course that focuses on plants, wildlife, antibiotics, or learning. Environmental Science Option Environmental Science is characterized by an integrative, multidisciplinary approach to environmental issues of concern to humans. This represents an exciting, rewarding area of science, which requires an especially strong academic background and an ability to think both analytically and comprehensibly. For students interested in careers that address solving environmental problems, there is the Biological Sciences major with an Environmental option. This rigorous option incorporates balanced studies in the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, and earth sciences) with social sciences (economics, political science, and sociology). It also involves technology, business, law, ethics, and human relations and behavior. Students interested in this option should visit with an adviser to obtain the specific requirements. Environmental Science students may not pursue a minor in Biology. Biological Sciences Education and Comprehensive Science Education Majors Students interested in Biological Sciences Education (p. 399) or Comprehensive Science Education (p. 402) are encouraged to declare a double major in the discipline and in education (i.e., Biological Sciences Education and Biological Sciences). Such double majors may be earned by successful completion of a few additional credits. Students should contact advisers in Biological Sciences for details. Students who intend to teach life sciences in the secondary schools should make their intentions known to the School of Education and consult with a biology education adviser in the Department of Biological Sciences (https://www.ndsu.edu/biology) early in their programs to make certain that they have a well-designed program and take the professional education courses required for state teacher certification. The Comprehensive Science Education major is designed to prepare the secondary general science teacher. This major is an especially good preparation for students who may find themselves teaching several different science courses. Information about curriculum and other requirements is available from the School of Education (https://www.ndsu.edu/education) and the education adviser in the Department of Biological Sciences. Biological Sciences Education and Comprehensive Science Education majors cannot pursue a minor in Biology. Major Requirements Major: Biological Sciences - Standard Degree Type: B.A. or B.S. Minimum Degree Credits to Graduate: 120 General Education Requirements for Baccalaureate Degree A list of approved general education courses is available here (p. 54).

Department of Coatings and Polymeric Materials www.ndsu.edu/cpmNorth Dakota State University 475 The Department of Coatings and Polymeric Materials is internationally known for the excellence of its educational and research programs. Close ties with industry and government agencies are maintained to assure that teaching and research programs remain in step with the rapidly changing science and technology of the area. Knowledge of polymers is a desirable foundation for a career as a professional chemist in industry. More than 80 percent of industrial chemists work with polymers, and many physicists and engineers also work with polymer-related materials. Within the broad area of polymers, the department puts special emphasis on coatings. Coatings are so often encountered in everyday life that they may be taken for granted. Paint on walls, coatings on automobiles or aircraft, liners for the interior of beverage cans, coatings to protect bridges from corrosion, coatings on magnetic tapes and computer chips, and body implants are only a few selected examples. Closely related fields are adhesives, printing inks, plastics, cosmetics, food, and biotechnology. Only five other universities in the U.S. offer programs in coatings and employment opportunities far exceed the number of graduates. To encourage students to study in the field, companies and organizations fund undergraduate scholarships of up to $2,500 a year. Entering freshmen and transfer students apply for these scholarships through the Office of Admission. Undergraduates already enrolled at NDSU apply through the department. The Department of Coatings and Polymeric Materials offers a minor at the undergraduate level. Undergraduates interested in polymers and coatings are encouraged to major in Chemistry (p. 471) or Mechanical Engineering (p. 342) (ME). Coatings and Polymeric Materials offers graduate level programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Coatings and Polymeric Materials, or a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Nanotechnology. The Coatings and Polymeric Materials minor provides excellent preparation for professional employment at the B.S. level and for graduate school. Students are strongly advised to plan their programs so that the entire coatings course ( CPM 474 Applied Polymer Science , CPM 475 Coatings' Materials Science ) and laboratory sequence ( CPM 484 Coatings I Laboratory , CPM 485 Coatings II Laboratory ) can be taken during the same academic year. Chemistry majors with the CPM minor also are required to take polymer synthesis ( CPM 473 Polymer Synthesis ) prior to graduation.

Advisers will provide students with personal attention in formulating programs with personal attention tailored to the interests and abilities of the individual student. For students with no computer experience, introductory courses are offered in the standard curriculum for majors. Students with some computing experience may contact the Department to arrange for an examination to receive credit for one or more of our courses (the student still registers and pays for the course, but does not have to attend or do any assignments or tests). It is possible for advanced undergraduate students to take graduate courses while completing the undergraduate program. Graduates in computer science might choose a job in technology development, business, agriculture, industry, non-profit, education, research, or government. Their work might be in any of these areas: systems analysis, software development, security, information assurance, bioinformatics, Web development, networking, information system development, data base management, software systems, computer operating systems, game development, technical support, systems for process control, automation systems, simulation models, design and development of new computer systems, or management. Graduates of the computer science program have recently accepted employment in major local and national businesses and industries. Many have chosen positions in North Dakota and adjoining states. With the wide use of computers and the Internet there is a growing need for computer specialists within North Dakota, the region, and the nation. Graduates are typically offered attractive starting salaries. Placement rates are high, and job prospects are projected to grow dramatically in upcoming years. To be prepared to enter the Computer Science program, a student should have the usual college preparatory courses including at least three years of mathematics. Courses that develop the ability to think logically, to organize, and to analyze are especially important. Students who have taken college-level courses or who have computer experience can have their work evaluated for possible departmental advanced placement. The results of an Advanced Placement test (http://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/creditexams/ap) may be used also.

Computer Science and Physics Since the dawn of the computer age, Computer Science and Physics have been closely intertwined disciplines. Computational physics is now an established branch of physics, complementing experiment and theory, that develops and applies computer modeling approaches to the solution of a wide range of physical problems. At the same time, software development (e.g., for graphics and data mining applications) is increasingly inspired by physics. Computer modeling, including simulation and numerical analysis, is an essential component of modern research and development. Correspondingly, the demand is growing for scientists with multidisciplinary training that combines fundamental knowledge of physics and computer science with practical skills in programming and computation. The Computer Science and Physics double major program is designed to allow students to complete the core requirements of both majors in a four-year degree. Graduates of the program will have a unique background qualifying them to work in industry or to pursue graduate studies in physics, computer science, engineering, or other technical fields.

Department of Mathematics www.ndsu.edu/math Mathematics Mathematics is the language of science and technology. Its explosive development in the 20th century and its history as the oldest and most highly developed discipline make it one of the most exciting and rewarding areas of study. The use of mathematics and the need for mathematical competence has increased tremendously. Mathematical training is in high demand in such fields as actuarial science, business, economics and commerce, engineering, and statistics, as well as the basic sciences. These disciplines, in turn, provide new directions to the mathematical community. Trends indicate that students should plan their programs to reflect the increased emphasis on interdisciplinary competency. Students are able to study theoretical and applied mathematics to prepare for careers or for further schooling while studying with faculty members who have a wide range of interests and expertise. Students may earn academic credit by applying what they have learned in the classroom as they gain on-the-job experience through the Cooperative Education program. Opportunities also exist for students to work as paper graders and assistants to professors. The department offers a broad and balanced curriculum of courses. A student may major or minor in Mathematics or Mathematics Education. Students interested in Mathematics Education should consult with their major adviser and the School of Education (https://www.ndsu.edu/education) for professional education requirements. Students interested in Mathematics Education are encouraged to declare a double major in their discipline and in education (i.e., Mathematics Education and Mathematics). Double Majors Special double majors are available with Computer Science, Physics, and Statistics. These double majors take advantage of the close relationship between mathematics and other disciplines, and allow students pursuing a major in one of these fields to expand their mathematical background.

The Actuary Science option is a pre-professional program designed to provide the background needed to enter the field. Entrance into the profession is regulated under a system of examinations run by actuarial professional societies. The curriculum for this option is designed to prepare the student to pass several of these examinations. The nature of the actuarial profession requires its practitioners to have a broad knowledge of finance, law, mathematics, management, and statistics. This option leads to a double major in Mathematics and Statistics with either a minor in Economics or additional courses in business. Students selecting this option are requested to visit with the actuarial advisers in both the Departments of Mathematics and Statistics early and often to confirm their progress and to inform themselves of changes in the examination curriculum.

Department of Physics www.ndsu.edu/physics Mission Statement \"To engage students, campus and community in the most fundamental of all sciences through excellence in teaching, first-class research, and dedicated outreach.\" Physics is the most fundamental and exact of the physical sciences. Its laws are basic to deep understanding in all of technology, and in many fields of study, such as astronomy, chemistry, materials science, engineering, photonics, biology, medicine, geology, and environmental science. The Department of Physics offers an undergraduate major in Physics, along with an option in Optical Science and Engineering. For students interested in teaching in secondary schools, a major in Physics Education is offered in conjunction with the School of Education (https://www.ndsu.edu/education) . Special double major programs in Mathematics and Physics and Computer Science and Physics are also available. These programs allow well-prepared students to complete the requirements for both majors in four years by taking advantage of the close connections between physics, mathematics, and computer science.502 Physics The Department also offers an undergraduate minor in Physics, as well as M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Physics at the graduate level. Highly motivated undergraduate students may elect to pursue an accelerated master's degree starting in their junior year, resulting in both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in Physics after approximately five years of study; interested students should contact their adviser for details. Physics (p. 502) Physics and Computer Science (p. 507) (double major) Physics and Mathematics (p. 510) (double major) Physics and Electrical Engineering (p. 329) (double major) Physics Physics Major Students who complete a major in Physics are prepared for careers in industrial and governmental research and development and for graduate study in physics, astronomy, engineering, medicine, materials science, and environmental science. In-depth preparation is also provided for teaching in secondary schools. Students interested in Physics Education are encouraged to declare a double major in their discipline and in education (i.e., Physics Education (p. 426) and Physics). Such double majors may be earned by the successful completion of a few additional credits. Students should contact their adviser, the School of Education (https://www.ndsu.edu/education) , or the Office of Registration and Records (https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar) for details and are encouraged to declare their primary and secondary majors with the Office of Registration and Records, Ceres Hall 110 (https://www.ndsu.edu/ alphaindex/buildings/Building::240) . Optical Science and Engineering Option This option includes an interdisciplinary optics/photonics sequence of courses taught by the Departments of Physics (https://www.ndsu.edu/physics) and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (https://www.ndsu.edu/ece) using a state-of-the-art optics teaching laboratory. This is the only regional program of its type. Optics and lasers are enabling technologies and are applied in most high-tech experiments, communications, devices, medical diagnostics, media, etc. There are more than 5,000 optics-related companies in the United States alone, but even more important, photonics provides the technical foundation for many more. Optical science and engineering has exploded to encompass nearly all fields of science and technology with a consequent shortage of individuals trained in the field. The optical science and engineering option will enhance any job search. Physics Minor A Physics minor consists of 19 credits, of which at least eight credits must be completed at NDSU.

Computational physics is now an established branch of physics, complementing experiment and theory, that develops and applies computer modeling approaches to the solution of a wide range of physical problems. At the same time, software development (e.g., for graphics and data mining applications) is increasingly inspired by physics. Computer modeling, including simulation and numerical analysis, is an essential component of modern research and development. Correspondingly, the demand is growing for scientists with multidisciplinary training that combines fundamental knowledge of physics and computer science with practical skills in programming and computation. The Computer Science and Physics double major program is designed to allow students to complete the core requirements of both majors in a four-year degree. Graduates of the program will have a unique background qualifying them to work in industry or to pursue graduate studies in physics, computer science, engineering, or other technical fields.

Some areas of psychology are most closely related to the natural and biological sciences while other areas within psychology are more closely related to the social sciences, especially sociology, anthropology, and communication. Both an undergraduate major and an undergraduate minor in psychology are available. Psychology majors may select the degree program that best suits their needs and interests from the B.A. and B.S. tracks outlined in this section. All majors must complete 30 credits in psychology as listed in the outline for the degree. Additional courses in psychology may be selected, in consultation with the adviser, from any of those listed under the department's offerings. Courses in the major field may not be taken on a pass/fail basis (except PSYC 494 Individual Study and PSYC 496 Field Experience , which may be graded on a pass/fail basis by the instructor). The B.S. psychology major also requires a supporting track in one of the following areas: 1.Natural Science Track: 14 additional credits in math, computer science, statistics, and/or science 2.Social Science Track: 14 additional credits in social science (other than psychology) 3.A Minor in an approved area of study Career Orientation Overlays An undergraduate education in psychology leads to a number of career choices following graduation. To assist students in preparing for post-graduate work and careers in psychology or related fields, the department has prepared several Career Orientation OverLays (COOLs). COOLs establish curriculum guidelines and suggestions for students who may be interested in a variety of careers, including medicine and neurosciences, business and industry, graduate school in psychology, or mental health and applied psychology. COOLs, when used in conjunction with the counsel of an adviser, are intended to help a student select the best courses within and outside of psychology (e.g., biology for medicine or business for industrial psychology) to suit particular interests and career goals. Advising Centers Information for students is available on the department web site and in the department main office in Minard Hall 232 (https://www.ndsu.edu/alphaindex/ buildings/Building::381) . Topics include requirements for majors and minors, COOLS, graduate school, and career information. Psychology (p. 514)514 Psychology Neuroscience (p. 517) Managerial Psychology (p. 517) Psychology Psychology Major A total of 120 credits is required for a major in Psychology leading toward a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree. Psychology Minor A minor in Psychology offers students electing majors in other disciplines the opportunity to complement their studies with a coherent set of psychology courses. Different courses are compatible with interests and career goals of students in major areas such as business, child development and family science, and computer science. Students planning a Psychology minor should consult with a faculty adviser from the Department of Psychology (https:// www.ndsu.edu/psychology) . Students selecting a minor in Psychology must complete 18 credits in psychology (excluding PSYC 494 Individual Study or PSYC 496 Field Experience ).

The curriculum for this option is designed to prepare the student to pass several of these examinations.North Dakota State University 521 The nature of the actuarial profession requires its practitioners to have a broad knowledge of finance, law, mathematics, management, and statistics. This option leads to a double major in Mathematics and Statistics with either a minor in Economics or additional courses in business. Students selecting this option are requested to visit with the actuarial advisers in both the Departments of Mathematics and Statistics early and often to confirm their progress and to inform themselves of changes in the examination curriculum.

Work or study abroad experience, as well as an integrative senior project that ties international study to the primary degree also are required. Languages Knowledge of a foreign language is an important part of the program. At NDSU students may study French, German, and Spanish. Additional language study is available through the Tri-College University in languages such as Norwegian, Japanese, and Chinese. Foreign language proficiency equivalent to completion of two years of college language study is required. This requirement may be met either through appropriate course work or through a testing procedure in the Department of Modern Languages (https://www.ndsu.edu/modernlanguages) . Experience Abroad An important part of the International Studies major is participation in a study, work, or research experience abroad for at least 10 consecutive weeks in duration. Assistance with finding an overseas study program is available in the Office of International Programs (https://www.ndsu.edu/international) . Selective Admission To be eligible to participate in the International Studies major, students must have sophomore standing with a minimum grade-point average of 2.50.

Degrees Offered: M.Acc. Test Requirement: GMAT 520 or GRE English Proficiency Requirements: TOEFL ibT 79 IELTS 6.5 Program Description The Master of Accountancy (M.Acc.) program at North Dakota State University is a non-thesis, professional program structured to advance the knowledge of qualified students with an undergraduate accounting degree. In addition, this program will enable students without an undergraduate accounting degree to prepare for a challenging but richly rewarding career in accounting. The accounting prerequisites for the program may be met with graduate courses, some of which are newly designed and online.536 Accountancy The Master of Accountancy (M.Acc.) program at NDSU is designed to have students complete graduate studies needed to advance their careers in public accounting, corporate accounting, or government accounting and to prepare them for the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam or Certified Management Accountant (CMA). Our approach to learning involves creating a collaborative environment in which students can develop analytical skills and gain in-depth accounting knowledge. Students will be prepared to identify accounting problems, research the problem and possible solutions through the use of on-line databases, and present a recommended action. The learning environment also provides students with the opportunity to draw from the experiences of fellow students from diverse backgrounds. Through the College of Business, North Dakota State University's M.Acc program is fully accredited by AACSB International (http://aacsb.edu), the premier accrediting agency in business administration and accounting.

Degrees Offered: M.A., M.S. English Proficiency Requirements: TOEFL ibT 100; IELTS 7 Program Description The Department of Sociology and Anthropology offers an M.S. and M.A. degree in Anthropology. The program centers on human heritage past, present and future, both cultural and material, and it is based on the principle that graduate level education in Anthropology is a desirable preparation for a growing number of career orientations. The precise plan of study for each student is established in consultation with the academic adviser. Graduate students are also expected to enhance their course work and degree research by engaging in professional development activities such as paper or poster presentations and/or attendance at academic conferences, campus and community service, and teaching and research assistantships. Sample positions that our graduates have obtained include university and college teaching, contract archaeology, folklore program coordination, international studies administration, National Park Service archaeology, not-for-profit program event coordination management, teaching English in other countries abroad, and research analysis as cultural experts. The focus of graduate education in Anthropology is directed toward both the development of applied anthropologists and the advanced training of those seeking to pursue a doctoral degree. Students may elect to take courses in a specialty area, or they may pursue a background in general anthropology. Areas of specialization include cultural anthropology and archeology. The Anthropology graduate program provides students with the opportunity to expand their background and perspectives in research methods and theory. Consequently, the first year of the program is designed to expose students to anthropological theory and a variety of research methods. Research facilities include the Archaeology Technologies Laboratory and Anthropology Materials Laboratory. Two program options are available for students. In the thesis option, students work on a research-based thesis. Students typically test theoretical assumptions using primary or secondary data. The comprehensive study option is designed for students who wish to combine their studies with some type of specialized field or internship experience. Students electing this option are required to complete a comprehensive study paper related to their experience, such as evaluating a program. Students in the Anthropology graduate program benefit from a favorable faculty-to-student ratio. Admission Requirements The Anthropology graduate program is open to qualified graduates from universities and colleges of recognized standing. To be admitted with full standing to the program, the applicant must meet the Graduate School's requirements and have adequate preparation in anthropology. Financial Assistance Teaching assistantships are available to qualified applicants. Research assistantships may also be available, contingent on faculty research funds. Applicants for assistantships are considered on the basis of scholarship and potential to undertake advanced study and research. To be considered for an assistantship, a completed Graduate School application, official transcripts, and three letters of reference must be received by the Graduate School no later than February 15. The masters degree (M.A. or M.S.) in Anthropology credit requirements consists of a minimum 30 credits (for the thesis option) or 35 credits (for the paper option), of which 16 must be didactic credits. Core requirements include the following: Successfully complete a theory-oriented Anthropology course (such as ANTH 680 Development of Anthropological Theory ) Successfully complete a methods-oriented Anthropology course (such as ANTH 681 Qualitative Methods in Cultural Anthropology )550 Architecture Complete additional coursework to finish the 30-credit requirement (24 for thesis, 26 for paper) Complete a research-based thesis or a comprehensive study paper and pass an oral defense of the thesis or paper administered by the student's supervisory committee.

Degrees Offered: Ph.D. Test Requirement: GRE English Proficiency IELTS 6 Program Description The CMB program was formed in 1988 and was the first interdisciplinary graduate program at NDSU. The program was designed to respond to the evolving nature of research in the life sciences in which it was recognized that biological phenomena emerge from molecular and cellular events and that the elucidation of such processes increasingly relies on multidisciplinary approaches. The CMB program provides cross training of graduate students in the areas of biochemistry and cellular and molecular biology. In this setting, students learn the most up-to-date approaches from a variety of fields. Integration across concepts as well as the application of various approaches to addressing biological problems is developed through their preliminary exam, in which students are required to write a research proposal in the format of a national granting agency different from their dissertation research, and to defend it orally. The students also develop and conduct an original line of research under the supervision of their major adviser. The program also brings together faculty with common interests and who use common approaches and equipment. Such a community of scientists fosters collaboration and engenders a sense of cooperation that leads to shared use of common equipment. The CMB program prepares students for careers in academia and private industry. All graduates of the program have obtained permanent positions in their field or are engaged in postdoctoral training. Nearly 40 faculty members in many different departments and representing a variety of colleges participate as faculty mentors. The program is led by the CMB Director, who receives guidance on policy, procedure, and program administration from a multidisciplinary group of faculty who serve on the CMB Steering Committee. Admission Requirements The Celllar and Molecular Biology Ph.D. program is open to qualified graduates of universities and colleges of recognized standing. To be admitted with full status to the program, the applicant must: Hold a baccalaureate degree from an educational institution of recognized standing. Have earned a cumulative grade point average (GPA) in all courses of at least 3.0 or equivalent at the baccalaureate level. Applications may be submitted directly to The Graduate School at any time. Have adequate preparation and show potential to undertake advanced study and research as evidenced by academic performance and experience. If possible, applicants should identify at least one Cellular and Molecular Biology faculty member with whom they wish to study. A recent score (within 12 months) for the general Graduate Record Examination or successful completion of a relevant M.S. degree is required. No minimum GRE score is required, but investigators may use this as a piece of evidence in consideration of the student's application. Foreign students are required to have proficiency in English as shown by a TOEFL iBT of 71 or higher or an IELTS of 5.5 or higher, unless they have matriculated from an institution in which instruction is conducted in English. The following undergraduate courses are required for graduate work in the CMB program: Biology - One year of general biology with laboratory and one course in genetics are required. Cellular biology or cellular physiology, animal or plant physiology, and microbiology are recommended.572 Cellular and Molecular Biology Chemistry - One year of general chemistry with laboratory and two sequential terms of organic chemistry with laboratory are required. Biochemistry is recommended. Mathematics - Two terms of life sciences calculus are required. Physics - Two sequential terms of general physics with laboratories (above the concept level) are required. Recommended - introductory courses in computer science, statistics, and technical writing. With program approval, up to 3 courses may be attempted within the first year of resident study to correct deficiencies in required courses. Graduate credit will not be earned for these courses. Applicant Selection Applications for the CMB program are accepted on a rolling basis throughout the year; however, for full consideration for a CMB program stipend, application must be made by the deadlines listed for fall admission (July 1). Acceptance into the program is based upon both the quality of the application and the capacity of the program. As a program that encompasses many departments and core areas of research, as well as being an interdisciplinary training program, it is helpful to potential advisers to know what aspects of research the student is interested in. Students are encouraged to explore potential advisers' work and identify areas of interest that align with one or more CMB faculty research program(s). These areas should be addressed in the applicant's statement of purpose. If an applicant is open to a broad range of research, it is helpful to identify that as well (for example, working with plant genetics, any aspect of infectious disease, aspects of either cancer biology or therapeutics, etc). Students are only admitted to the program if a successful match with a CMB faculty member can be made, so this is a critical aspect of the application demonstrating what the student will bring to the research endeavor. Participating Departments/Programs North Dakota State University offers an interdisciplinary program leading to the doctoral degree in Cellular and Molecular Biology. The CMB program is a joint effort of the Colleges of Agriculture, Food Systems, Natural Resources; Science and Math; Health Professions; and Engineering and includes the Departments of Animal Sciences, Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Coatings and Polymeric Materials, Electrical & Computer Engineering (Bioengineering), Microbiological Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physics, and Plant Sciences. Financial Assistance Self-funded students who provide their own support through sponsored funding sources (governmental or grant funding only) may contact CMB faculty members with whom they wish to work or the CMB Director to inquire which investigators are accepting students so that a successful research mentorship can be arranged. While the CMB program offers a limited number of competitive graduate assistantships that includes a full tuition waiver, financial support is usually provided by the department or laboratory in which the student will carry out research. Therefore, applicants are encouraged to research participating faculty members' areas of expertise and identify them in their statement of purpose. Students are encouraged to contact those with whom they would like to work regarding availability of positions and funding. In instances where specific investigators are not identified in the Statement of Purpose, the Director will contact faculty members who are accepting new students for their appraisal of the application. Program Objectives The CMB program has been designed to respond to the evolving nature of research in the life sciences in which it was recognized that biological phenomena emerge from molecular and cellular events and that the elucidation of such processes increasingly relies on multidisciplinary approaches. In addition, new applications of sensor technology, disease diagnosis and treatment, and other emerging technologies require that scientists work across historical boundaries of their disciplines. This is a research-oriented degree that requires advanced skills areas of biochemistry, cellular biology, molecular biology, and contemporary research techniques. Prospective students must have a high quantitative aptitude and be prepared to undertake rigorous graduate-level training in research including quantitative methods. BIOC 701 Comprehensive Biochemistry I (required) BIOC 702 Comprehensive Biochemistry II (required) BOT 820 Advanced Cell Biology Select one of the following: BIOC 719 Molecular Biology of Gene Expression and Regulation MICR 783 Advanced Bacterial Genetics and Phage PLSC 731 Plant Molecular Genetics BIOC 674 Methods of Recombinant DNA Technology (required) PLSC 684 Plant Tissue Culture and BiotechnologyNorth Dakota State University 573 Each student is expected to seek out professional development by attending regular seminars in their home department or in conjunction with their research interests (for example, a seminar series or COBRE science series).

The program is built on a core of emergency management and methods/theory courses to help students approach the study of disasters and emergency management from the emergency management disciplinary perspective. Additionally, the program draws from other disciplines that enhance the development of processes and techniques to deal with emergencies and disasters. The master's and doctoral degree programs in emergency management at NDSU are campus-based. Potential students are encouraged to visit the campus and meet faculty and current graduate students. Master of Science Degree The comprehensive and challenging Master's degree program in Emergency Management is intended to explore the academic research literature related to emergency management as well as provide students with opportunities to apply their knowledge through research and/or practicum. The program is built on a core of emergency management courses to help students learn how human beings create, interact, and cope with hazards, vulnerability, and associated events. The program emphasizes the study of how human beings cope with hazard events through activities related to preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. The Department of Emergency Management offers two tracks in its master's degree program. The first option - the thesis track - is a research-focused degree track that entails a combination of emergency management course work and research methods. This option is ideal for graduate students who intend to pursue a doctoral degree in Emergency Management or a related discipline and for those students who want to complete a traditional master's degree. The second option - the comprehensive study option - is a more practice-based track with course work in emergency management and a significant practicum requirement. Doctoral Degree North Dakota State University offers a Doctor of Philosophy in Emergency Management designed to prepare graduates for careers teaching future generations of emergency management students in higher education programs, conducting research that describes and explains patterns, processes, change, and effectiveness/efficiency related to emergency management, and/or policy development and analysis related to emergency management. The degree program is built on a core of emergency management courses to help students learn how human beings create, interact, and cope with hazards, vulnerability, and associated events. The program emphasizes the study of how human beings cope with hazard events through activities related to preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. Additionally, the degree program requires students to choose two areas of concentration built on courses from disciplines outside of emergency management to complement their emergency management educational foundation. This comprehensive and challenging program is committed both to extensive research and its practical application in the areas of emergency management. Throughout their graduate career, students will have the opportunity to conduct research and work in the field. The Ph.D. is awarded in recognition of significant depth of understanding and scholarly achievement in emergency management. The recipient must complete all of the required course work, pass three written comprehensive exams (one on emergency management theory, one on the two functional areas in which the student has specialized, and one on research methods), complete a novel and significant research project for the dissertation; and successfully defend this research in an oral examination. The student's progress will be reviewed by a supervisory committee that is responsible for reviewing the student's plan of study, written comprehensive examinations, dissertation proposal, and dissertation defense. Admissions Requirements The Department of Emergency Management at NDSU is selective in choosing graduate applicants for entry into the master's and doctoral programs. Admission is competitive reflecting the department's commitment to small, high quality, student cohorts that match the mentoring capacity of the faculty. Applicants will be evaluated in a two-stage process. In the first stage, the applicant's Graduate School application, letters of reference, GRE scores (if applicable), and academic writing paper samples will be reviewed by the Department of Emergency Management faculty. Applicants demonstrating goodness-of-fit with the Department of Emergency Management's mission and goals and an aptitude for graduate study will be invited to complete the second stage of the admissions process.North Dakota State University 623 Admissions Process The two-stage admissions process for graduate studies in the Department of Emergency Management is as follows: STAGE ONE 1.Applicants must first complete the Graduate School's online application form (https://app.applyyourself.com/AYApplicantLogin/ fl_ApplicantConnectLogin.asp?id=ndusndsugr) and submit the required materials. 2.Applicants must submit transcripts from the higher education institutions they have attended to the Graduate School. 3.Applicants must submit three letters of reference through the Online Application tool. Academic references are preferred. 4.All applicants who have not completed a master's degree in the United States must submit GRE scores. If an applicant has completed a master's degree in the United States, then GRE scores are not required but still strongly recommended. It is helpful to have as much data as possible about applicants and their aptitude for graduate work in our program. In no case are specific GRE discipline tests required. At this time, however, no specific score totals are used as a cutoff. Applications are evaluated holistically using all indicators of student aptitude for successful completion of graduate study in this program. Applicants must submit GRE scores by requesting that ETS-GRE (http://www.ets.org/gre) send the NDSU Graduate School their score. 5.Applicants must submit electronic copies of two writing samples through the Online Application tool. The samples may be a publication, material from prior course work, or specifically written for this application. The samples do not have to focus on emergency management or disasters. The samples must be written in English. Writing samples are used to gain information on the applicant's writing style and ability to write research-based papers. Samples submitted in support of an application would ideally be eight or more pages in length. In addition, to meet the objective of the admission criteria, the paper must employ formal citations. Writing samples will most typically be library-based research papers but papers based on original data gathering are also encouraged. The latter might be more likely to come from an applicant with a master's degree. STAGE TWO 1.Applicants invited to participate in the second stage of the admissions process will take part in a conference call interview with two or more of the program faculty. Applicant interviews are designed to provide two-way communication between the faculty and prospective applicant. Faculty will ask questions but will also want the applicant to pose questions about the program and departmental educational objectives. The interview should assist the applicant and faculty to further assess the goodness-of-fit between the program and the applicant. Interviews will also evaluate the applicant's ability to engage in evidence-based reasoning. We are most likely to accept doctoral applicants who demonstrate their understanding of the concepts included in the following list of books: Mileti, D. (ed) (1999). Disasters by design: A reassessment of natural hazards in the United States. Washington, DC: John Henry Press. Rubin, C. (ed) (2007). Emergency Management: The American experience 1900-2006. PERI. Sylves, R. (2008). Disaster policy & politics. Washington, DC: CQ Press. Tierney, K., Lindell, M., & Perry, R. (2001). Facing the unexpected: Disaster preparedness and response in the United States. Washington, DC: John Henry Press. Wisner, B., Blaikie, P., Cannon, T., & Davis, I. (2004). At risk: Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters. New York: Routledge. The emergency management faculty at NDSU believe that the best doctoral degree program in emergency management will be made up of a diverse student body. We welcome applicants to the doctoral degree program with master's degrees from a variety of disciplines; applicants from all countries; applicants with different professional backgrounds; and applicants with varying goals and interests. We want to ensure, however, that applicants entering the program are knowledgeable about emergency management and some of the literature that provides the foundation for the discipline. Therefore, when applicants are interviewed during the application process, the faculty expects that the best candidates will demonstrate their familiarity with the major concepts presented in the books listed above. By asking potential doctoral students to enter the program with foundational knowledge of the emergency management literature, the department hopes to accomplish several goals. First, in reading the books on the reading list, prospective students will be able to confirm their desire to pursue a doctoral education in the discipline of emergency management. Second, the department assumes that students who undertake this reading in preparation for their application interview will be bright, motivated, and passionate about the study of emergency management. Third, and finally, a basic understanding of the emergency management literature will help students coming into the program from a variety of backgrounds succeed once they begin their studies at NDSU. Financial Assistance Both teaching and research assistantships are available, contingent on departmental and faculty research funds. All students are automatically considered for graduate assistantships, unless they request otherwise, so no separate application process is required for such consideration. Awards are based on past academic and professional performance. The review process is highly competitive.624 Emergency Management Emergency Management Master's Thesis Track Code Title Credits Core SOC 700 Qualitative Methods 13 SOC 701 Quantitative Methods 1,23 EMGT 720 Theory, Research and Practice 3 Disaster Phases EMGT 761 Preparedness Theory and Practice 3 EMGT 762 Mitigation Theory and Practice 3 EMGT 763 Response Theory and Practice 3 EMGT 764 Recovery Theory and Practice 3 Electives Select 3 of the following: 9 EMGT 610 Comprehensive Emergency Management Planning EMGT 614 Spatial Analysis in Emergency Management EMGT 620 Hazard, Risk, and Vulnerability Assessments EMGT 625 International Emergency Management EMGT 645 Vulnerability and Functional Needs in Emergency Management EMGT 661 Business Continuity & Crisis Management EMGT 663 Voluntary Agency Disaster Services ANTH 664 Disaster and Culture EMGT 681 Disaster Analysis EMGT 696 Special Topics EMGT 730 Advanced Research Methods Practicum EMGT 795 Field Experience 3 Thesis EMGT 798 Master's Thesis (minimum 6 - maximum 10 credits, only 6 count toward degree) 6 Total Credits 39 Emergency Management Master's Comprehensive Study Track Code Title Credits Core EMGT 720 Theory, Research and Practice 3 EMGT 761 Preparedness Theory and Practice 3 EMGT 762 Mitigation Theory and Practice 3 EMGT 763 Response Theory and Practice 3 EMGT 764 Recovery Theory and Practice 3 Electives Group A: Emergency Management Elective Courses Select four of the following: 12 EMGT 610 Comprehensive Emergency Management Planning EMGT 620 Hazard, Risk, and Vulnerability Assessments EMGT 625 International Emergency Management EMGT 635 Issues in Homeland Security and Emergency Management EMGT 645 Vulnerability and Functional Needs in Emergency Management EMGT 661 Business Continuity & Crisis Management EMGT 663 Voluntary Agency Disaster Services ANTH 664 Disaster and Culture EMGT 681 Disaster AnalysisNorth Dakota State University 625 EMGT 696 Special Topics Group B: Critical Thinking and Analysis Elective Courses Select two of the following: 6 EMGT 614 Spatial Analysis in Emergency Management SOC 700 Qualitative Methods 1 SOC 701 Quantitative Methods 1,2 STAT 725 Applied Statistics EMGT 730 Advanced Research Methods Practicum EMGT 795 Field Experience 6 Comprehensive Study Paper EMGT 797 Master's Paper 3 Total Credits 42 1 Students must have completed an undergraduate research methods course prior to enrolling in Quantitative and Qualitative Methods. 2 Students must complete a statistics course as a prerequisite for Quantitative Methods. *Those students lacking in field experience will be expected to complete an applied, field-based emergency management practicum; however, students with ample field experience in emergency management will be expected to complete a research practicum to fulfill the practicum credits.

English Proficiency Requirements: TOEFL ibT 79 IELTS 6.5636 Environmental and Conservation Sciences Program Description The graduate program leading to an M.S. or a Ph.D. in Environmental and Conservation Sciences (ECS) rests on an integrative curriculum and a multidisciplinary team approach. The program emphasizes the common ground shared by all sciences, and seeks to bridge methodological and philosophical boundaries that might hinder interdisciplinary communication and cooperation. The program offers three tracks: Environmental Science, Conservation Biology and Environmental Social Sciences. The Environmental Science track focuses on abiotic environmental issues, such as water, air, and land pollution. The Conservation Biology track focuses on biotic issues, such as the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function. The Environmental Social Sciences track emphasizes relationships between humans and the natural environment such as cultural and behavioral issues, policy, business and economics, and sustainable development. The interdisciplinary nature of this program is reflected by the participation of faculty from across the campus, including the Colleges of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Natural Resources; Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; Engineering; and Science and Mathematics. Environmental Science Areas of Environmental Science, such as climate change, groundwater, hazardous waste, and water chemistry, require broad training across discipline lines for successful application. To better predict anthropogenic environmental impacts, the engineering, earth material, chemical, and biological data must be considered in an integrated manner. Conservation Biology Conservation Biology offers a new philosophy of looking at complex problems. This discipline focuses on the loss of regional and global biodiversity, but considers the human element as well in its approach to resource issues. As an example, landscape ecology, sustainable development, and conflict resolution are themes promoted by the field of Conservation Biology. Environmental Social Sciences Environmental Social Sciences discipline looks at interactions between humans and the environment which tend to be complex and often require interdisciplinary efforts to understand and manage. Environmental policy, environmental economics, environmental history, environmental communication, environmental sociology, and human ecology are examples of the fields of study. Admissions Requirements To be admitted to the Environmental and Conservation Sciences program, the applicant must meet the Graduate School requirements. Financial Assistance The applicant should contact a prospective mentor to identify sources of financial aid. Teaching and research assistantships may be available through funded research or participating departments. Applicants are considered on the basis of scholarship and potential to undertake advanced study and research. Contact the office of Financial Aid and Scholarships for information and applications regarding scholarships.

Degrees Offered: Ph.D., M.S., Certificate 71; IELTS 6652 Food Safety Program Description The Food Safety program was founded in 2001 to help meet the increasing need for individuals with food safety expertise in government, business, and academia. The graduate program is interdisciplinary, and NDSU graduate faculty from several colleges participate in advising graduate students. The NDSU Graduate School administers the academic program, while the home department of the adviser handles assistantship and tuition waiver administration. Academic policies are under the governance of the Food Safety graduate program faculty. Degrees Offered and the Graduate Certificate Three programs are offered at the graduate level. Research project-based degrees include the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and the Master of Science (M.S.). The thesis-based M.S. degree will prepare students for supervisory roles in the food industry, in regulatory agencies, or in public health and is preparatory for students who may wish to advance to Ph.D. programs. Individuals earning a Ph.D. degree will be educated as independent researchers, expanding their potential to become principal investigators of food safety research in various arenas, including business, academia, and government. The non-thesis M.S. is intended for working professionals looking to augment their skills or credentials. Most coursework can be completed online, although the candidate must be present on-campus to present seminar and also the M.S. paper. The Graduate Certificate in Food Protection is aimed at professionals looking to augment their skills, as well as graduate students in other programs wishing to add a credential to their degree programs. All course work for the Certificate is completed online. Admissions Requirements Food Safety program admission is open to all qualified graduates of universities and colleges of recognized standing. Appropriate degrees might be in food science, food safety, meat science, cereal science, microbiology, veterinary science, economics, engineering, dietetics, nutrition, agricultural policies or communication. To be admitted with full status to the program, the applicant must meet the Graduate School admission requirements along with additional requirements: Thesis based M.S. Submission of Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test scores that are lower than the 50th percentile will generally weaken an applicant's chance of being accepted. In all cases, other forms of evidence for academic success will be considered and may supersede the GRE score for evaluative outcomes. Dissertation based Ph.D. Applicants with a completed M.S. degree (in any related field of study) are generally regarded as more prepared for the Ph.D. program than applicants with only a bachelor's degree. \u00b7 For students that have not already completed an M.S. degree at an institution in the United States, the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test scores are required. Scores that are lower than the 50th percentile will generally weaken an applicant's chance of being accepted. Other forms of evidence for academic success will be considered and may supersede the GRE score for evaluative outcomes. Graduate Certificate and Non-thesis option The Graduate Certificate in Food Protection does not require the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test (GRE). Applicants to the non-thesis M.S. holding a bachelor's degree from a recognized U.S. institution are not required to complete the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test. The GRE is required for International applicants to the non-thesis M.S. program. Other forms of evidence for academic success will be considered and may supersede the GRE score for evaluative outcomes. The Graduate School does not forward applications for review to the program until the application package is complete. Failure to meet these program deadlines may result in rejection or postponement of admission. Common errors resulting in late applications include missing letters of recommendation and late payment of application fees. Applications completed by the deadlines are forwarded from the Graduate School to the Food Safety Program director. These are then sent to the Food Safety faculty for review. Acceptance of the applicant will be judged by the faculty using a combination of factors, including those presented above, and on applicant's recommendation letters and statement of purpose. Applications of acceptable quality for the M.S. and Ph.D. programs may still be rejected if an adviser cannot be identified and if there is not an assistantship available to support the applicant. Applications of acceptable quality for the Graduate Certificate will generally be accepted, unless enrollment caps are being enforced. All applicants will be notified about final decisions as soon as possible, however, applicants should understand that processing may take several weeks after the deadlines. Financial Assistance Applicants must apply to the Graduate School and be accepted before being eligible for an assistantship in the Food Safety M.S and Ph.D. programs. Very limited funding is available through the Food Safety program itself. Assistantships are generally only available when faculty members have grant funding for support of a student. Graduate tuition is waived for students with assistantships. Teaching assistantships are occasionally available toNorth Dakota State University 653 qualified students. Alternative support, equivalent to a Graduate Research Assistantship may be provided to a student by an outside sponsor such as a private company, university or government. Financial support is not available for the Graduate Certificate Program and the non-thesis M.S in Food Safety. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) For candidates who have been granted a M.S. from a recognized program, the Ph.D. program requires the completion of 35 semester credits of course work with an overall GPA of 3.0 or better, as well as 25 research credits (SAFE 899). Fifteen of these credits must be at the 700-789 level. The Ph.D. program is, by design, highly flexible to allow study in the diverse areas of specialization that are related to food safety. While a number of core courses, including SAFE 601-609, seminar (SAFE 790) and research (SAFE 899) are required, additional course work can be tailored to meet the candidate's interests and area of specialization. This additional course work, however, must contribute to proficiency in an area of food safety. An advisory committee will be established for each candidate admitted. This committee will consist of the major adviser (committee chair), and two other selected graduate faculty. The student and major adviser will prepare the plan of study, which is subject to the approval of the advisory committee, the Food Safety program director, and the Graduate School dean. The plan of study should be completed by the end of the first semester of enrollment in the program. Ph.D. candidates are required to pass a preliminary examination at least one semester prior to the defense of the dissertation. Two preliminary exam options are available. The first involves the standard written and oral examinations covering the candidate's course work. The second involves successful preparation and defense of a research grant proposal, under accepted guidelines (e.g. USDA-NIFA, NIH).

English Genomics and Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary graduate program that involves faculty from nine departments. Advanced research and study will focus on either functional or computation genomics. The program is designed to provide both M.S. and Ph.D. students the necessary skills and intellectual background to work cooperatively with others in a research area that takes a systems-wide approach to the study of the organization and expression of the many genes and their products expressed in an organism. Exposure to modern techniques and instrumentation will prepare the student for success in both industrial and academic careers. Admissions Requirements It is the intent of the program to admit students in either of two tracks. The Functional Genomics track will be for students interested in the generation and application of genomic information. The Computational Bioinformatics track is intended for students interested in using computer science and statistical approaches to analyze large amounts of genomic data. The Genomics graduate program is open to qualified graduates of universities of recognized standing. The Graduate School minimum for the TOEFL examination applies. In addition, the following are the requirements to be admitted with full standing. Functional Genomics track: a B.S. degree with courses in genetics, physiology, biochemistry; an upper-division statistics class; an introductory biology class emphasizing molecular biology; and minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.0. Computational Bioinformatics track: a B.S. degree with courses in calculus, comparative computer languages, data structures, an upper-division statistics class, an introductory biology class emphasizing molecular biology, and minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.0. Students can be accepted conditionally into either track without meeting the course or GPA requirements, but will be required to meet those requirements while in residency. Research The student is required to perform original research in an area of genomics. This will be under the direction of the student's major adviser. To promote cross-disciplinary research, the student is encouraged to collaborate with a student in the other track. This does not apply to M.S. students pursuing the Comprehensive Study Option. Adviser and Graduate Committee During the first year, the student will select an adviser, form a graduate committee, and submit the Plan of Study to the Graduate School. The committee must include the student's major adviser, at least one other faculty member of the Genomics and Bioinformatics program, and the Graduate School appointee.

The student must present three comprehensive study papers. Students write one comprehensive study paper for their major and each of their minor areas of program study. These papers involve substantial research and synthesis in secondary materials. The department does not expect these papers to be original contributions to the world of scholarship, but rather syntheses that demonstrate mastery of particular topics. Students selecting this track must meet the following requirements: Lesson Plan Option This option is designed for graduate students who are teachers at the K-12 level, or who plan to be. The number of credit hours and the course requirements are identical to those of the Comprehensive Plan Option. In the Lesson Plan Option, the student prepares three lesson plans in a parallel fashion to the comprehensive study papers (See Comprehensive Study Option above). In addition to the lesson plan, the student needs to reflect on these teaching units and provide an intellectual and pedagogical context for them. This reflection should demonstrate scholarly thinking and effort.

For the project option, of the required minimum 30 credits, at least 27 credits must be didactic courses numbered 601-689, 691, 700-789, and 791, while the research credits (797) must be at least 3, but not more than 4, credits. The Doctor of Philosophy degree requires 60 credits beyond the M.S. requirement (90 credits total). Didactic course work must account for at least 27 credits, and of these, 15 credits must be earned in 700-level courses. It is customary for the remainder of the didactic credit requirement to be dedicated directly to the dissertation, either through course preparation, focused research or writing. For either the M.S. or Ph.D., all courses taken outside of the IME Department must be approved in advance by the student's academic adviser. The total course of study must be approved by the student's academic adviser, thesis committee, and department chair. Students completing graduate degrees within the IME Department responsibility are expected to exhibit demonstrable expertise in the core competencies of either industrial engineering or manufacturing engineering. Students whose undergraduate major is in another field may be required to include some or all of the core competencies in their graduate coursework. For further information in this regard, please consult the IME department.North Dakota State University 687 Each new student must complete a preliminary thesis or project proposal within six months of beginning graduate studies, and it is recommended that this be completed during the first semester in residence. The proposal, if approved by the IME Graduate Studies Committee, will provide the direction for the remainder of the student's degree work. At the same time, the student will choose a thesis or project adviser from the IME department faculty. By the end of the first year in residency, the student must have selected a supervisory committee. This committee will be chaired by the faculty adviser and will provide direction, advice and examination of the student's work and achievement.

IELTS 6North Dakota State University 699 Program Description North Dakota State University offers an interdisciplinary program leading to the Master of Science or Ph.D. degree in Materials and Nanotechnology (MNT). The program includes a series of required MNT core courses; additional elective courses; written and oral preliminary examinations; a doctoral dissertation based on independent, original research in the area of materials and nanotechnology; and a final oral examination of the dissertation. Admissions Requirements The program in Nanotechnology and Nanomaterials is open to qualified graduates of universities and colleges of recognized standing. Students with a degree in the disciplines of chemistry, engineering, material science and engineering, physics, polymer science, polymer engineering, or related fields will be considered for admission. Applicants must meet the Graduate School requirements (p. 786). Financial Assistance Students are routinely supported through research assistantships. Applicants are considered on the basis of scholarship, potential to undertake advanced study and research, and financial need. All students who submit complete applications by the appropriate deadlines are considered for assistantships. Exceptional students are also eligible for university fellowships that are awarded on a competitive basis. By the end of the first academic year, the student will select an academic adviser from among the MNT faculty and arrange for the appointment of a Graduate Advisory Committee. This committee will consist of at least four members of the graduate faculty. This includes the student's major adviser, at least one additional MNT faculty member, and an appointee of the Graduate School. The plan of study will be prepared by the student, in consultation with the major adviser, by the end of the first year in residence. The plan shall be approved by the student's Graduate Supervisory Committee, the MNT Program Director, and the Graduate School dean. The plan of study must be filed in the Graduate School prior to scheduling the comprehensive written examination. Master of Science Graduate students in Materials & Nanotechnology are able to obtain a master's degree following one of two different tracks. In each case, a total of at least 30 graduate credits with a grade point average of 3.0 or better are required. The non-thesis option (Masters of Materials and Nanotechnology - Plan B) is appropriate for working professional students or students who are certain that they do not wish to pursue future graduate work in any field of science or engineering to the level of doctorate. In the context of the MNT program, this is the equivalent of a Plan B Master's with a 6-10 credit culminating experience (794) replacing the research credits (798). The thesis option (Plan A) represents a more traditional Masters of Science in Materials and Nanotechnology, with an independent research component in the form of an original thesis that can serve as a foundation for future doctoral work in science or engineering. For the Thesis Option, of the required minimum 30 graduate credits, at least 16 credits must be from approved graduate courses numbered from 601-689, 691, 700-789, and 791 while the research credits (798) must be not fewer than 6 nor more than 10 credits. Ph.D. The Graduate School requires the plan of study for the Ph.D. degree to include not less than 90 semester graduate credits. Of this total, not less than 27 credits must be in courses other than seminar or research credits. Of the 27 course credits, 15 must be at the 700-789 level. The MNT Ph.D. program requires students to complete a series of 7 core courses totaling 17 semester credits. The student will complete additional elective courses to fulfill The Graduate School requirement of 27 semester credits in academic courses. An overall GPA of 3.0 or better must be maintained.

Openings may be very limited for spring. Degrees Offered: Ph.D., M.S. English Proficiency Requirements: TOEFL ibT 71; IELTS 6 Program Description The Department of Mathematics offers graduate study leading to the degrees of Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). Advanced work may be specialized among the following areas: including algebraic number number theory, approximation theory, ergodic theory, harmonic analysis, and operator algebras applied mathematics, differential equations, dynamical systems, combinatorics and graph theory geometry/topology, including differential geometry, geometric group theory, and symplectic topology Beginning with their first year in residence, students are strongly urged to attend research seminars and discuss research opportunities with faculty members. By the end of their second semester, students select an advisory committee and develop a plan of study specifying how all degree requirements are to be met. One philosophical tenet of the Department of Mathematics graduate program is that each mathematics graduate student will be well grounded in at least two foundational areas of mathematics. To this end, each student's background will be assessed, and the student will be directed to the appropriate level of study. Admissions Requirements The Department of Mathematics graduate program is open to all qualified graduates of universities and colleges of recognized standing. In addition to the Graduate School requirements (p. 786), applicants must have earned a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 or equivalent in all advanced mathematics courses at the baccalaureate level. Financial Assistance Teaching assistantships and a small number of research assistantships are available. Graduate tuition is waived for research and teaching assistants. All students in full standing and, in certain situations, students in conditional status are eligible for assistantships. International students must show proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking English. In particular, they must pass an oral proficiency interview, which is a Test of Spoken English (TSE) prior to receiving a teaching assistantship. This interview is the culmination of the five-week Intensive English Language Program (IELP) available each summer. An indication, but not a guarantee, of being able to pass this interview is a TOEFL score of at least 600 (paper test) or 247 (computer test). All international students applying from outside the United States for a teaching assistantship must expect to take the IELP. Assistantship applications will be considered at any time. However, opportunities are improved for those received by March 1 preceding the fall semester of intended enrollment. At least one year of academic work must be spent in residence at NDSU in fulfilling graduate requirements for each graduate degree earned. The M.S. customarily takes two years to complete: the Ph.D. usually last three years beyond the master's. Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 throughout their graduate career.704 Mathematics Master of Science The Master of Science degree is offered in two options: the Thesis Option or the Comprehensive Study Option.

Comprehensive Examination By the end of their fourth semester, students: submit a report that summarizes their research results so far and details a research plan for the rest of their research work; give a talk about their research accomplishments and plans; and must pass an oral examination by the Advisory Committee to confirm doctoral candidacy. Students who pass the comprehensive examination and, at the time of the exam, have completed 30 credits (16 of which are didactic) will earn a master's degree and be eligible to participate in commencement that semester. Students should choose the Ph.D. + master's option from the drop-down menu on the Doctoral Degree Plan of Study and on the Request to Schedule Examination. After students have passed the comprehensive examination, they should complete the Exit Survey and the Degree Application. A link to these items will be emailed to them by the Graduate School. If the student fails the comprehensive examination, she/he will be given the opportunity to repeat the examination in the next semester (this examination can be repeated only once). Alternatively, the student may elect to work for a master's degree instead. Students should submit their doctoral thesis for examination at the end of their fourth year Dissertation Video Doctoral students are required to submit a three-minute video summarizing their dissertation research for a lay audience. The video should be produced, with guidance from the thesis supervisor, during the final semester of study and presented to the supervisory committee at the final defense. For the comprehensive and final examinations, students must submit the appropriate forms to the Graduate School. .

Domestic applicants should apply at least one month prior to the start of classes. Degrees Offered: Ph.D. (Plant Sciences only), M.S. Requirements: TOEFL ibT 71; IELTS 6 Program Description The Department of Plant Sciences offers graduate studies leading to the M.S. degrees in Plant Sciences and Horticulture, and to a Ph.D. degree in Plant Sciences. Specialized academic and research training in Plant Sciences is available in plant breeding and genetics, weed science, biotechnology, field and forage crop production and management, and sports and urban turfgrass management. Areas of specialization in Horticulture and Forestry include breeding and genetics, biotechnology, physiology, propagation, and production and management of horticultural crops such as woody plants, potatoes, vegetables, and herbaceous ornamentals. Areas of specialization in cereal science may involve research in the areas of carbohydrates, enzymes, legumes, and other northern-grown crops; barley malting and brewing; wheat milling, baking, and pasta processing. Each study area is designed to provide students with a comprehension of the discipline and of relevant regional and global-community social issues. The Department of Plant Sciences is located in Loftsgard Hall, completed in 1991, with modern and well-equipped research laboratories, offices for faculty and graduate students, and classrooms. Loftsgard Hall, which is part of the Plant Science Complex, provides a state-of-the-art facility for interdisciplinary research in plant sciences, ranging from basic studies and biotechnology to the more traditional applied areas. Facilities for cereal science research are located in Harris Hall. These facilities include analytical laboratories for grain quality research, baking, milling, malting and brewing, and pasta and noodle processing. State-of-the-art greenhouses and extensive growth chamber facilities are also available, as are 100 acres of field research land adjacent to the Plant Science Complex. An additional 500 acres of research land are located near the North Dakota State University campus. A horticultural farm only 25 miles west of campus has an extensive arboretum. Excellent supporting disciplines located nearby, or in the Plant Science Complex, include Soil Science, Botany, Cereal and Food Sciences, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Entomology, and Plant Pathology. The Department of Plant Sciences encourages interdisciplinary research, and students frequently tailor their research program to meet their interests by working with faculty in one or more of the supporting disciplines. Graduate student numbers per faculty member are limited, so the student gets adequate personal attention and works closely with their adviser in research. Final selection of the adviser will be made on the basis of the student's interest, availability of space in the researcher's laboratory, and a common desire of the student and professor to work together. Not quite half of the graduate students are Ph.D. candidates. Admission Requirements The Department of Plant Sciences graduate programs are open to all qualified graduates of universities and colleges of recognized standing. To be admitted with full status to the program, the applicant must meet the Graduate School admission requirements. Students who do not meet all requirements for admission, but show potential for successful graduate study, may be admitted under a conditional status. Evidence must be provided, showing that the applicant's potential is not adequately reflected by his/her record.738 Plant Sciences/Horticulture Financial Assistance Research assistantships (half-time) are provided on a competitive basis, usually based on scholarship and potential to undertake advanced study and research. As of the 2014-15 academic year, the annual stipend generally is $17,000 for an M.S. candidate and $18,200 for a Ph.D. candidate, but this may vary based on the research project. Graduate tuition is waived for all students with research assistantships. A limited number of graduate fellowships are available. The information provided for the application to the Graduate School is also used to assign available assistantships to applicants. The Department of Plant Sciences also has numerous annual scholarships of $500 to $1000 each for outstanding Plant Sciences graduate students. The M.S. program (Thesis Option) requires completion of at least 30 credits; this includes 10 credits of thesis research. The Ph.D. program requires completion of at least 90 credits; this includes 30 credits for an earned M.S. degree (Thesis Option) and 20 additional research credits. For each M.S. or Ph.D. candidate, a plan of study will be developed in the first year that meets the disciplinary requirements as well as the individual needs of the student. The faculty adviser and other members of the student's supervisory/advisory and examining committee assist in developing of the plan of study as well as the student's research plan. An M.S. Program (Comprehensive Study Option) is also offered in Plant Sciences. This option requires completion of at least 30 credits, including 3 credits of a Master's Paper. Candidates for the M.S. degree normally satisfy all requirements within a two-year period, and Ph.D. candidates normally require three additional years. For M.S. candidates, an oral examination of academics related to the discipline and the research-based thesis is required. The Ph.D. candidates are required to pass a preliminary written and oral examination of academics related to the discipline and a final oral defense of a research-based dissertation. A B.S. to Ph.D. program is permitted for students who meet higher admission requirements.

Thus, a major emphasis is on research training. We hope to train researchers who will contribute to psychological knowledge through the investigation of clinically relevant issues, including basic research on the nature, etiology, and course of health related problems or psychological disorders, as well as applied research which investigates the prevention and treatment of health and mental health problems. Admissions Criteria When making admission decisions, grades, GRE scores, research experience, letters of recommendation (preferably from faculty who can comment on your research skills and academic potential), and the personal statement are considered. To the extent that an applicant has a strong background in psychology, including course work in statistics, research methods, abnormal psychology, and personality, and good research experience, this will be an advantage. Applicants who already have a master's degree will be judged by the same criteria. For applicants with a master's degree, credit towards the doctorate will depend on how well previous course work matches with the program requirements. Campus visits or interviews are not required, although the department may arrange for a visit via phone or internet video with top candidates. Applications are due by January 15 in order to receive full consideration for admission in the upcoming academic year. Admission decisions will be made by mid-March. Applications are reviewed once a year and students are admitted for fall semester only. Students are required to gain a breadth of knowledge in the foundations of psychology through courses in biological, cognitive, and social bases of behavior. Course work in research methods and statistics, assessment, psychopathology, health, and interventions comprise the clinical portion of the curriculum. Practicums at local hospitals, clinics, and mental health agencies provide supervised experience in service delivery and applied research. This is a full- time program and will take five years, including internship, to complete.

Facilities are available for protein and DNA sequencing, oligonucleotide synthesis, interactive laser cytometry, scanning transmission and electron microscopy, and confocal microscopy. Students must select a major adviser prior to their arrival for graduate studies. The Master of Science program generally requires a minimum of 24 months of full-time study, during which an overall GPA of 3.0 or better must be maintained. The Master of Science degree may be earned by either of two options. The thesis option emphasizes completion of a research project. The comprehensive study option requires more course work, and instead of conducting research and presenting a thesis, the candidate presents a paper or papers approved by the adviser to the examining committee, demonstrating ability for scholarly study and written expression. Candidates under both options must present a seminar on the thesis research or comprehensive study, and must pass an oral examination. The Ph.D. program generally requires a minimum of 36 months of full-time study, during which an overall GPA of 3.0 or better must be maintained. Candidates for the Ph.D. are required to take a preliminary written and oral examination directed to academic subject matter and a final defense of the dissertation.

All applicants who have submitted the required application materials will receive notification of their admission decision by email. Admission of International Students North Dakota State University welcomes international students as part of the student body, and the Graduate College encourages applications from qualified students throughout the world. More than 25% of the approximately 2,100 graduate students are international. In addition to meeting the previously stated admission requirements, to qualify for admission in an advanced degree program, all international students must demonstrate proficiency in English and must provide evidence of adequate financial support for themselves and any dependents for the duration of their graduate program. Language Proficiency for Admission English proficiency must be demonstrated prior to admission by obtaining a minimum score of 525 (paper-based test) or 71 (internet-based test) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or a score of 6 on the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). Some programs require higher scores for admission to their degree programs. The test date must be within two years of the date of the application to the Graduate College. Information about these tests is available on our website (http://www.ndsu.edu/gradschool/prospective_students/international_applicants/ english_language_score_requirements/#c41215) . The TOEFL or IELTS score may be waived for students who have been raised in one of the following countries or who have earned a bachelor's degree or higher from a recognized institution in one of the following countries. Antigua and Barbuda Liberia Australia Mauritius Bahamas Micronesia (Federated States of) Barbados New Zealand Bermuda Nigeria Canada (except Quebec) Saint Lucia Dominica Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Gambia Scotland Ghana Sierra Leone Great Britain Solomon Islands Grenada Trinidad and Tobago Guyana United States Ireland Zambia Jamaica Zimbabwe788 Admission Information Required Student Health Insurance All international students in F and J status are required by the North Dakota University System (NDUS) to purchase the approved health insurance policy through UnitedHealthcare StudentResources. The charge for health insurance is due no later than the sixth week of each semester, and it is to be paid onto your student account. For more information on payment deadlines and the policy itself, please see the following website: https://www.ndsu.edu/ international/insurance. Immunization Requirements Please see the NDSU Student Health Service 'Immunization' webpage for important information about immunizations and all other immunization requirements. To familiarize yourself with these requirements, please visit this website: https://www.ndsu.edu/studenthealthservice/immunizations/. Language Proficiency for Teaching Assistants There are two recognized categories of teaching assistants: (1.) Graduate Teaching Assistants (who have direct contact with students) must have one of the following minimum scores: TOEFL iBT 81 (speaking 23 or above and writing 21 or above) IELTS 7.0 (speaking and writing 6.0 or above) PTE Academic 54 (speaking 62 or above and writing 56 or above) (2.) Graders (who have no direct contact with students) must have one of the following minimum scores*: TOEFL iBT 79 (speaking 19 or above and writing 21 or above) IELTS 6.5 (speaking 5.5 or above and writing 6.0 or above) PTE Academic 53 (speaking 51 or above and writing 56 or above) *Graders may serve in this capacity for no more than one (1) calendar year. To continue as a GTA, students must meet the GTA language requirements listed under (1.) above OR successfully complete the following courses: 1. LANG 701 English Language and Classroom Skills for International GTAs 2. LANG 702 English Language Tutorial for International GTAs Admission Status Graduate students will be admitted under one of the following classifications: Full Graduate Standing These students have met all requirements for admission and have been accepted by a program leading to a graduate degree. A student must have full graduate standing to receive a graduate degree. Conditional Standing Students in conditional standing do not meet all requirements for admission or have deficiencies in prerequisite course work but show potential for successful graduate study. Evidence must be provided showing that the applicant's potential is not adequately reflected by his or her record. In making this recommendation, the program must specify standards of performance that must be satisfied for a change in status to full graduate standing. Any student admitted in CONDITIONAL status is automatically placed on academic WARNING until the conditions of admission are met. If a student on academic warning fails to achieve a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 in the subsequent semester of attendance, the student will be placed on academic probation. The student may not earn more than 12 semester hours of graduate credit while in conditional status. Non-Degree Enrollment This category is for individuals who desire to pursue study beyond the baccalaureate degree for personal growth and improvement of skills but not in order to work toward an advanced degree objective. To become a non-degree student, individuals must submit the online application form and fee (and English proficiency test score, if applicable). Students must have the prerequisite courses or background/experience necessary for the course or courses in which they desire to enroll. This may require consultation and approval from course instructors. In courses with limited enrollment, preference will be given to degree-seeking students. Students enrolled with non-degree status are not eligible for graduate assistantships, tuition waivers, or federal title IV student financial assistance. Students in this category are affiliated with the Graduate College and not an academic program. No more than 10 credits taken under the non-degree status with a grade of B or higher can be transferred to any official program of study should there be, at any future date, a decision to seek degree classification. Professional development graduate courses (numbered 600) are not eligible for graduate degree programs and may be taken without formal admission to NDSU.North Dakota State University 789 Change in Classification Students enrolled with non-degree status may subsequently desire to be considered for admission to the Graduate College to pursue an advanced degree. Such a change in status may be accomplished for a subsequent term by submitting a complete application to the Graduate College as a degree- seeking student. The student must be acceptable to a specific program. Appropriate course credits (no more than 10) earned in the non-degree status may be used to fulfill graduate degree requirements if approved by the student's program committee and the Dean of the Graduate College. No course taken in the non-degree status for which the grade is less than B will be permitted on a plan of study for a graduate degree. General Policies Scholastic Standards To be in academic good standing and to receive a graduate degree, a student must have a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0. All courses taken by a graduate student for which grades are given will be used in calculating the GPA. Credits taken as Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory grading are not used in calculating the GPA. When a course has been repeated, both grades will appear on the transcript, but only the second grade will be used in calculating the GPA. A specific course can be retaken only once, and only three total courses can be retaken. In fulfilling graduate course requirements on any plan of study, only grades of A, B, or C are acceptable. For master's paper (797), master's thesis (798), and doctoral dissertation (899), only the grade of satisfactory (S) is acceptable. For seminar (790/890), graduate teaching experience (792/892), individual study/tutorial (793/893), practicum/internship (794/894), or field experience (795/895), only grades of A, B, C, or S are acceptable for graduate credit. Programs and/or supervisory committees may require a higher performance than C in certain courses. While some courses may be used for graduate credit with a grade of C, courses with grades of D, F, or U may not be used for graduate credit. Acquisition of more than two grades of C, D, F or U may be grounds for dismissal upon recommendation by the program administrator. These minimal scholastic requirements apply to each student enrolled in the Graduate College. Additional requirements may exist for certain graduate programs. Academic Warning Any student in GOOD STANDING whose cumulative GPA drops to less than 3.0 at any time of attendance is automatically placed on academic WARNING. Any student admitted in CONDITIONAL status because of grade deficiency is automatically placed on academic WARNING. A student on academic WARNING cannot register for the following semester until the grades for the current semester post. A Plan of Study cannot be submitted until a student has completed the conditions of admission and is in good academic standing. If a student on academic WARNING fails to achieve a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 in the subsequent semester of attendance, then the student will be placed on academic PROBATION. Academic Probation A student on academic PROBATION may not continue the pursuit of a graduate degree program without a recommendation from the appropriate program administrator and a waiver from the Dean of the Graduate College. This recommendation must include a review of the student's current status and a proposed plan of remediation which provides the student an opportunity to return to a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 within one additional semester (fall or spring) for full-time students and two semesters for part-time students (i.e. students taking 5 credits or fewer). The remediation plan must be developed in collaboration with the advisor and approved by the graduate program director or department chair; the approved remediation plan has to be submitted to the Graduate College in order to receive a waiver from the Dean of the Graduate College. This plan must include: the specific course(s) you plan to take verification that the course(s) will be offered the grade you plan to earn in order to return to a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 within one semester any additional information that addresses past obstacles to academic success (optional). The remediation plan must be submitted and approved in time for the student to register for the academic term (fall or spring) that immediately follows the term in which the student was placed on probation. If the student does not submit an acceptable plan in time to enroll for the next academic term (fall or spring), or if the cumulative GPA is not at least 3.0 after the probationary period, the student will be dismissed from his or her graduate program. A student on academic PROBATION is not eligible for a graduate assistantship or tuition waiver.790 General Policies Dismissal from the Graduate College Graduate students may be suspended or dismissed from NDSU as a result of failure to meet our scholastic standards, academic or professional misconduct, insufficient progress toward a degree, failure to meet professional expectations or standards or failure to submit an acceptable remediation plan. Students suspended or dismissed from the Graduate College are not eligible for admission into any degree-granting or certificate program or into non-degree status for a period of at least one calendar year from the date of their suspension or dismissal. Suspension or dismissal does not become complete until the completion of any appeal process (p. 805). Graduate Courses Courses approved at the 600, 700 and 800 level may be taken for graduate credit and used to satisfy course requirements on the student's graduate plan of study. Didactic courses are those courses approved for graduate credit numbered 601-689, 691; 700-789,791; 800-889, 891. Courses numbered 690, 692-699, 790, 792-799, 890, 892-899 are considered special or experimental courses and are not to be included as didactic courses on a plan of study. Courses that a student has used to fulfill the requirements of a baccalaureate degree may not be used on that student's graduate plan of study. Registration for Research Credit A student conducting research for the disquisition is to be enrolled in 797, 798 or 899 for the number of credits specified on the plan of study. Such registration is required even in absentia when faculty and/or administration time is consumed in manuscript review, communication, and other forms of assistance. Enrollment Status The Graduate School requires students be registered for at least one credit fall and spring semester until all degree requirements are completed . Nine credits are considered a full-time graduate load. Graduate Assistants working 20 hours per week are considered full-time if registered for five or more graduate credits. To receive financial aid, students must be enrolled at least half-time (i.e. 5 credits). Loan deferment may also require full- or half-time status. Eligibility varies with financial aid programs; students should contact their lender for requirements. Time Limitations Graduate credit for any course work that is more than seven (7) calendar years old at the time of the final examination cannot be used to satisfy a master's degree program. The analogous time limitation for a doctoral degree is 10 years. The student will have one (1) year from the date of the final examination to complete the Graduate School disquisition review process and all other degree requirements. Should the disquisition not receive final approval or any other degree requirements not be completed within this time limit, the student must repeat the final examination. Continuous Enrollment Students are required to register for at least one credit each semester (fall and spring) until all degree requirements are completed, including Graduate School approval of the thesis, paper, or dissertation. The graduate dean will not approve the degree until the student has registered for the number of credits of research for any semesters not covered by either registration or leave of absence, but not more than four (4) credits total. A student who has not registered for longer than a continuous two-year period must also reapply for admission and is subject to the degree requirements at the time of readmission. Leave of Absence Students who interrupt their graduate program prior to the completion of all degree requirements must obtain a leave of absence, using the Request for Leave of Absence from Graduate Studies form (http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/gradschool.ndsu.edu/Forms/Student_Forms/Leave_of_Absence.pdf) . NOTE: Leaves of absence do not amend in any way the seven and ten-year time limitations. Family and Medical Accommodation Policy for Graduate Students The Graduate School at NDSU is committed to promoting an environment where students can successfully balance their academic and family responsibilities. The goal of this policy is to provide consistent, equitable treatment to all graduate students, regardless of family status, by providing timeline extensions for completing preliminary/qualifying examinations and by offering modified duties to students experiencing a serious health condition or needing to provide care to a new child or a seriously ill family member.North Dakota State University 791 1. Extensions for Completing Preliminary/Qualifying Examinations, Final Examinations, and/or Disquisitions Eligibility: A graduate student is eligible to apply for a time extension on completing preliminary/qualifying examination, final examination, and/or disquisition upon a showing that they are: 1.In good academic standing and making progress toward degree completion, and 2.Undergoing childbirth, caring for their newborn, caring for their child with a serious medical condition, adopting a child, accepting foster placement of a child, experiencing their own serious medical condition, or experiencing a serious medical condition of a spouse/partner or parent for which they have caretaker responsibilities (medical certification may be required). Length of Extensions: While each extension granted under this policy will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, absent extraordinary circumstances, the additional time granted by this policy will not exceed two years. A graduate student undergoing childbirth, adopting a child, or accepting foster placement of a child shall be entitled to receive an extension of up to one extra year for completing preliminary/qualifying examination, final examination, and/or submitting a disquisition. A graduate student experiencing their own serious medical condition, caring for their child with a serious medical condition, or experiencing a serious medical condition of a spouse/partner or parent for which they have caretaker responsibilities shall be entitled to receive an extension of up to six extra months for completing a preliminary/qualifying examination, a final examination, and/or submitting a disquisition. Application/Approval Process: Graduate students who wish to obtain an extension under this policy must document their eligibility in writing to their academic unit prior to the effective date of the extension - retroactive requests will not be considered, absent extraordinary circumstances. The student's academic unit and the Graduate School will then assess the student's eligibility and approve/deny the extension. Additionally, international students on a visa must have their extension approved by the Office of International Programs. Leave of Absence Students requesting an extension may also choose to take a leave of absence from their graduate program. International students will need to consult with the Office of International Student and Study Abroad Services to determine if they are eligible for a leave of absence. 2. Modified Duties for Graduate Assistants Eligibility: A graduate assistant is eligible for \"modified duties\" if the graduate assistant: 1.Becomes a parent through childbirth, adoption, or foster placement of a child; 2.Has a health condition that makes him or her unable to perform regular duties but does not necessitate a reduction in workload; or 3.Will be caring for a child, spouse/partner or parent who has a serious health condition. 4.Must have served as a graduate assistant for at least one academic term. Definition and Length of Modified Duties: \"Modified duties\" means a change to duties and goals without reduction of stipend for a limited period of time. A graduate assistant taking modified duties will still be at a 100% workload and 100% stipend; however, the nature of the responsibilities for this time period will be adjusted. Modified duties will include a revision of workload for up to the equivalent of a semester. If warranted and supported by appropriate medical documentation, graduate students can be excused from most, if not all, of their regular duties for up to six weeks without a reduction in pay. All eligible students will be granted a Parental Accommodation period for up to six weeks immediately following the birth of a child or the adoption of a child under the age of 6 for which the student has parental responsibilities. (Additional time may be granted based on medical documentation of exceptional medical circumstances experienced by the student or his/her child, spouse, partner, or dependent parent.) Regardless of circumstances, modified duties agreements must conclude within 12 months. Application/Approval Process A graduate assistant requesting modified duties shall document their request in writing to their supervisor and department chair/head. The graduate assistant and the department will engage in an interactive process to determine how the graduate assistant's duties will be modified and the duration of the modified duties. In the event that an agreement cannot be reached between the graduate assistant and the department, the Dean of the Graduate School shall assist in reaching an agreement. To ensure that all parties are operating under the same understanding, the agreement for modified duties792 Master's Degree Policies shall be put in writing. Graduate assistants accepting modified duties are subject to the regular evaluation procedures used in the program; however, such evaluations shall be based on the agreed upon modified duties. Master's Degree Policies Degrees Offered Master of Arts (M.A.)/Master of Science (M.S.) North Dakota State University offers master's degrees in three categories. A program need not offer all three types of master's degrees. The types of degrees offered should be justified based on relevant criteria such as pedagogy or principles appropriate to the field. Programs wishing to grant a Master of Science degree or a Master of Arts degree typically need to satisfy the requirements of either the Plan A or the Plan B option. Candidates for the Master of Arts degree will meet the general requirements and those specific requirements in the humanities or social and behavioral science; these typically include two years of a foreign language. The Plan C degree is primarily intended for professional degree programs. In addition, the three plans differ in the composition of the student's supervisory committee and required submissions to the Graduate School upon degree completion. Plan A: Thesis-based Master's The thesis would typically include a problem statement, a review of existing literature relevant to that problem, and the creation and presentation of new knowledge in providing a solution to the problem. Each student would assemble a supervisory committee as described on the next tab. Each candidate is required to pass a final oral examination in which the supervisory committee serves as the examining committee. Following a successful defense, the candidate will submit an electronic copy of their thesis to the Graduate School for review. Plan B: Master's Paper/Comprehensive Study-based Master's The Plan B master's student will develop a thorough understanding of existing knowledge and the ability to apply that existing knowledge to a problem of interest. Note that under this degree, the new knowledge being created is limited, and this is the primary difference between the Plan A and Plan B degrees. The precise nature of the individual creative component is defined by the program. Examples of possible creative components include a comprehensive paper, a portfolio, or an integrated field experience. Candidates for the Master of Arts degree will meet the general requirements and those specific requirements in the humanities or social and behavioral sciences; these typically include two years of a foreign language. Each candidate would assemble a supervisory committee and pass a final oral examination. Following a successful defense, the candidate will compose an executive summary or assemble other appropriate documentation as defined by the program to be submitted to the Graduate School. This submission to the Graduate College is to be approved by the student's supervisory committee. Plan C: Culminating Experience-based Master's Plan C is designed for programs in which a well-defined culminating experience is more important than is an individual creative component. This degree will most frequently be available in professional degree programs. Each program will define a culminating experience such as a capstone course, a written examination, or some other approach to measure the candidate's understanding of the relevant material in the area. The student's supervisory committee would generally consist of faculty solely from within that discipline. The supervisory committee may specify that a certain level of performance (i.e., a minimum GPA) be obtained in specified courses or in the program itself. Upon completion of the appropriate course work and culminating experience, the candidate must submit to the Graduate School examination documentation (if required by program) and an Application for Graduate Degree. Professional/Non-Thesis Degree Programs Master of Accountancy (M.Acc.) The Master of Accountancy (M.Acc.) program at North Dakota State University is a non-thesis, professional program structured to advance the knowledge of qualified students with an undergraduate accounting degree. The program is designed to have students complete graduate studies needed to advance their careers whether their career be in public accounting, corporate accounting, or government accounting and prepare them for the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam. Master of Athletic Training (M.A.Trg.) The Master of Athletic Training is a professional program that is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). The M.A.Trg. will prepare students to take the Board of Certification, Inc. (BOC) examination and earn the 'ATC' credential. Didactic courses and clinical experience courses focus on prevention, assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of injuries resulting from physical activity.North Dakota State University 793 Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) The Master of Business Administration degree is a non-disquisition, professional degree program structured to serve qualified students with any undergraduate degree. The program has two general parts: a foundation course requirement involving up to 30 semester credits and an M.B.A. (common body of knowledge) graduate course requirement of 30 semester credit hours. Master of Construction Management (M.C.M.) The Master of Construction Management is an online professional program consisting of 30 credits of course work and the Associate Constructor (AC) Exam. The Master of Construction Management is administered through Distance and Continuing Education (DCE) (https://www.ndsu.edu/dce) at NDSU. Master of Education (M.Ed.) The Master of Education degree is a non-disquisition, practitioner-oriented degree for teachers and school counselors. Candidates for this degree will meet the general requirements as well as specific requirements established by the School of Education. Master of Engineering (M.Engr.) The Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering is a course work only program requiring a capstone consisting of a portfolio or written exam. Faculty are experienced researchers in the following areas: Signal Processing Group, Biomedical Engineering, Power/Power Electronics, Integrated Circuit, Electromagnetics, and Computer Engineering. The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering is also a key contributor to NDSU's Research and Technology Park. Master of Managerial Logistics (M.M.L.) The Master of Managerial Logistics is a 36 graduate credit professional degree program targeted specifically at career military officers, Department of Defense civilians, and other logistic professionals. Master of Music (M.M.) The Master of Music in performance and conducting is the professional degree in music designed for performers and conductors wishing to augment and refine their skills. The M.M. in Music Education is designed for music teachers who wish to update and increase their practical pedagogical knowledge. Master of Natural Resources Management (M.N.R.M.) The Master of Natural Resources Management degree is designed as a professional, non-thesis degree program specifically designed for students holding a Bachelor of Science degree in Natural Resources Management or a closely related field who are seeking an educational opportunity for advanced course work culminating in a professional terminal degree. Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) Public health is defined as the practice of helping members of society live healthier, longer lives. More specifically, public health focuses on improving the general health of communities through efforts to monitor the spread of diseases, initiatives (both clinical and policy-oriented) to prevent disease and disability, and by promoting healthy lifestyles through education and community engagement. NDSU offers the M.P.H. degree with specializations in American Indian public health, health promotion, management of infectious disease, and public health in clinical systems. Master of Software Engineering (M.S.E.)

Master of Transportation and Urban Systems (M.T.U.S.) The Master of Transportation and Urban Systems is a non-disquisition degree that is primarily intended for professional planners and engineers. Students in the M.S. and M.T.U.S. programs can select from a common set of courses. However, students enrolled in the non-disquisition (M.T.U.S.) program have more opportunities for synthesis of practice and additional course work, with less emphasis on research. Education Specialist (Ed.S.) in Educational Administration In addition to offering several Master of Education (M.Ed.) programs preparing candidates for administration credentials in North Dakota, the Educational Leadership program prepares students for Master of Science (M.S.) and Education Specialist (Ed.S.) degrees in Educational Administration. Programs meet certification requirements in the various areas appropriate to elementary and secondary administration.794 Master's Degree Policies Supervisory Committee The supervisory committee should be formed during the term immediately after the major adviser is identified for the student, and members should be identified before the plan of study is formulated so that all committee members have a chance to contribute to the Plan of Study. The supervisory committee agreed upon by the major adviser and student, and approved by the program administrator and the academic dean shall be recommended to the Dean of the Graduate College for final approval. The supervisory committee will have at least three members. The members consist of: 1.The major adviser, who must be a full or affiliate member of the graduate faculty Level 1 or 2. The student selects the adviser with approval of the program administrator and the Dean of the Graduate College. The major adviser-student relationship must be a mutually acceptable one. The major adviser will act as the chair of the student's supervisory committee and will be in charge of the Plan of Study. The remaining members of the committee must be agreed upon by the student, the major adviser, and the Dean of the Graduate College. 2.A second member, who must be a full or affiliate member of the graduate faculty. 3.A third member, who could be either a faculty member from outside the student's program or a qualified off-campus expert in the field. If this committee member is not a full or affiliate member of the graduate faculty, the approval of the Dean of the Graduate College is required. Approval by the dean requires a memo from the program/department chair explaining the qualifications of the person to be on the committee and the person's curriculum vitae. Plan of Study The Plan of Study shall include the specific courses the student is expected to complete and any other special requirements of the particular master's degree that the student is seeking. A student must be in good academic standing to submit a Plan of Study. The Plan of Study should be submitted to the Graduate College for approval no later than the term immediately after the supervisory committee is formed and must be filed in the Graduate School prior to scheduling the final examination. Revisions may be made, with the Request for Change form, later as advisable and necessary, but must be approved by the student, adviser, the administrator of the student's program, and the graduate dean. Each program has the responsibility of defining the requirements for a major in its disciplinary area. This information should be made available to students electronically and/or in the program handbook. Didactic, Greek for \"to and 891 . Plan A Master's Degree Minimum 30 credits total 16 of the 30 must be didactic credits 6-10 credits of research (798 Master's Thesis) Plan B Master's Degree Minimum 30 credits total 21 of the 30 must be didactic credits 2-4 credits of research (797 Master's Paper) Once these minimum requirements have been met, any other graduate courses can be used to satisfy the remaining Plan of Study requirements. The various programs determine which approved graduate courses may be used. For specific requirements, the student should consult the programs. A student may use up to 10 credits taken as a non-degree NDSU graduate student toward the degree.. Transfer of Credit All graduate credits used to meet the requirements of a master's degree must be approved by the supervisory committee, the program administrator, and the Dean of the Graduate College. A candidate for the master's degree must petition in order to transfer up to a maximum of 10 semester hours of graduate credit from another institution to satisfy course requirements on the Plan of Study. Credits are transferred at the time the Plan of Study is approved. Transfer credits 1.College-level course work from regionally accredited colleges or universities (or equivalent for international institutions) is eligible for acceptance in transfer (credits from international institutions can be transferred only if approved by a committee from the student's program); 2.must carry only grades of A or B on a 4.0 scale; 3.must have been earned within a 7-year period at the time of the final examination; 4.must be graduate level;North Dakota State University 795 5.must not be a continuing education, correspondence, extension, or workshop course; 6.must not be internship, individual study, special problem, or research (disquisition) courses, or courses graded Pass/Fail or Satisfactory/ Unsatisfactory; 7.must not have been used to fulfill the requirements of a baccalaureate degree; 8.must be verified by an official transcript; and 9.will not be used in calculation of the grade point average. It is the responsibility of the student to provide official transcripts of graduate courses taken elsewhere to the Graduate College. NOTE: The Special Problem credits of item (6) above are equivalent to North Dakota State University's 696/796 Special Topic credits. Time Limitation Graduate credit for any course work that is more than seven (7) calendar years old at the time of the final examination cannot be used to satisfy degree requirements. The final examination is valid for one year. Should a student not have his/her disquisition approved by the Graduate College or fail to meet other degree requirements, the final examination must be retaken. If a period of time two years or greater lapses before the disquisition is approved by the Graduate School, the student must reapply, re-defend the thesis and must register for a minimum of two (2) credits. The student's degree will post at the end of the semester in which the disquisition is approved by the Graduate School. Multiple Graduate Degrees On occasion, a student may be allowed to work at satisfying the requirements of two graduate degrees concurrently. In completing all program and Graduate College requirements for two degrees, a maximum of nine (9) graduate credits of course work can be applied to both programs of study as approved by all members of both supervisory committees, the two program administrators, the academic dean(s), and the Dean of the Graduate College. A student pursuing multiple graduate degrees must maintain continuous enrollment in each program. The disquisitions must differ substantially and must result from substantial work completed independently in each discipline. There are two final examinations. The appropriate time limitation applies to all course work. Master's Degree with Two Major Areas Under special circumstances, a student may pursue one master's degree with two major areas. Such a program must have the concurrent recommendation of the administrators of the two programs. The Plan of Study shall clearly delineate the course work required for each major area. A minimum of 40 credit hours is required, including at least 14 graduate course credits in each of the two major areas. No more than 10 of the required 40 credits shall be research credits under the Plan A master's, while no more than three of the required 40 credits shall be paper credits under the Plan B master's. The student is required to conduct interdisciplinary scholarly work culminating in a disquisition acceptable in both major areas. Final Examination (Plan A and B) The candidate shall pass a final examination (either oral or written as specified for the degree) before being awarded the master's degree. The supervisory committee shall serve as the examining committee of which the major adviser shall serve as chair. The final examination shall cover the course work taken by the candidate and also the disquisition, seminar papers, or oral examination paper and fundamental knowledge. Once a date is finalized with the student's supervisory committee, the Notification of Scheduled Examination (https:// www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/gradschool.ndsu.edu/Forms/Student_Forms/Request_to_Schedule.pdf) form must be filed with the Graduate College at least two (2) weeks prior to the examination. The disquisition in a near final form must be given to the committee members no fewer than seven (7) days prior to the examination. If this seven 7-day stipulation cannot be met, the student must either secure the concurrence of all committee members or reschedule the examination. At the conclusion of the examination, the examining committee shall record, in writing, approval or disapproval. The Report of Final Exam (http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/ gradschool.ndsu.edu/Forms/Student_Forms/Report_of_Final_Examination.pdf) must be filed with the Graduate College within seven (7) days of the exam. A negative vote by more than one member of the student's committee will signify failure of the final examination. The student may repeat the examination only upon permission from a majority of the supervisory committee. The committee will set a date at least one month after the failed examination. Exceptions to this time limit will be considered by the graduate dean upon presentation of written justification from the chair of the committee in consultation with the committee. Should the examination be failed twice, the student will not be given a third examination except by recommendation of the examining committee, program administrator, and special approval of the Dean of the Graduate College following consultation with the Graduate Council.796 Doctoral Degree Policies Continuous enrollment is required ( fall and spring semester) until all degree requirements are completed, including Graduate School approval of the thesis or paper. Students defending in the summer semester must register for summer semester. To participate in commencement, the student must have passed the final examination seven (7) days prior to the commencement ceremony. IRB, IBC, and/or IACUC Approval If a proposed graduate research project involves human, animal, or biohazard subjects, it must be submitted for review and approval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and/or the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). This process should be initiated by the student after his or her supervisory committee has approved the final research design, because IRB, IBC, and/or IACUC approval must be obtained before the research project commences and cannot be granted retroactively. A copy of the appropriate approval letters is required when the dissertation is submitted for editing. Disquisitions that involve research using humans or animals as subjects or using biohazard materials will not be approved by the Graduate College if such research has not been previously approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), or Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) as appropriate. Every effort should be made by advisers to see that students are aware of these University requirements. Filing the Thesis or Paper After the final examination, the student incorporates all revisions into the disquisition as required by the supervisory committee. Once the corrections are made, students must submit the following items to the Graduate School: signed approval page IRB/IACUC/IBC Compliance Notification disquisition disquisition processing fee The student will have one (1) year from the date of the final examination to complete the Graduate School disquisition review process and all other degree requirements. Should the disquisition not receive final approval or any other degree requirements not be completed within this time limit, the student must repeat the final examination. If a period of time two (2) years or greater lapses before the final copy is submitted, the student must reapply to the Graduate College, retake the final examination, register for a minimum of two (2) credits and request an extension. A degree posts at the end of the semester in which the disquisition is approved and other degree requirements are completed. Plan of Study Students in Plan C (professional programs) must submit a Plan of Study (https://www.ndsu.edu/gradschool/current_students/forms/#c225106) by the end of their second semester of course work. Some programs have set curriculum and their own Plan of Study. The chair of the student's supervisory committee/adviser must be a full or affiliate member of the graduate faculty. Master's course work is valid for seven (7) calendar years after a student matriculates. A leave of absence does not change this 7-year time limit. Degree Completion Students in programs not requiring a thesis or paper must complete the Graduation Application (https://www.ndsu.edu/gradschool/graduating_students/ non_thesis_masters_programs/#c294203) form and submit it to the Graduate College the semester in which the degree will be completed. There is a $25 processing fee that may be paid online. No transcript or diploma will be issued until this fee is paid. Doctoral Degree Policies Degrees Offered Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.) The D.M.A. is the terminal professional practical degree in music, designed for performers and conductors wishing to acquire the highest performance abilities. Doctor of Nursing Practice (D.N.P) The Doctor of Nursing Practice degree is a clinical doctorate offered for post baccalaureate nurses with specialization as a Family Nurse Practitioner. An individually-tailored program of study for the D.N.P. is also available for the certified advanced practice nurse with a master's degree.North Dakota State University 797 Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) The Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) is available with two options: 1) Institutional Analysis and 2) Occupational and Adult Education. The degree requires extensive field service involving qualitative and/or quantitative research, leading to a dissertation that will apply a theory at an institution. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded in recognition of high scholarly attainment as evidenced by a period of successful advanced study, the satisfactory completion of prescribed examinations, and the development of an acceptable dissertation covering some significant aspect of a major field of learning. Residence Requirements Graduate study for the Doctor of Philosophy degree normally requires a minimum of three (3) years of full-time study beyond the baccalaureate degree. A student who has a master's degree or equivalent must devote at least one of the two remaining academic years of study in residence at North Dakota State University. Language Requirements Some graduate programs have a language requirement and, if so, the program will determine the language or languages applicable to the candidate's field of study. International students whose native language is not English may satisfy the language requirement in their native language, providing their graduate program approves. In these cases, the basis for proficiency will be the candidate's use of English, rather than the foreign language. Language proficiency is certified by the Department of Modern Languages. Supervisory Committee The supervisory committee should be formed during the term immediately after the major adviser is identified for the student, and members should be identified before the plan of study is formulated, so that all committee members have a chance to contribute to the Plan of Study. The supervisory committee will have at least four members. The members consist of: 1.The major adviser, who must be a full or affiliate member of the graduate faculty Level 1. The student selects the adviser with approval of the program administrator and the Dean of the Graduate College. The major adviser-student relationship must be a mutually acceptable one. The major adviser will act as the chair of the student's supervisory committee and will be in charge of the Plan of Study. The remaining members of the committee must be agreed upon by the student and the major adviser. 2.A second member, who must be a full or affiliate member of the graduate faculty. 3.A third member, who could be either a faculty member or a qualified off-campus expert in the field. If this committee member is not a full or affiliate member of the graduate faculty, the approval of the Dean of the Graduate College is required. Approval by the dean requires a memo from the program/department chair explaining the qualifications of the person to be on the committee and the person's curriculum vitae. 4.The Graduate School Representative (GSR) is chosen by the student, in consultation with the committee chair, at the time of the supervisory committee formation. Eligibility Requirements: The GSR must be a full member of the graduate faculty, AND be either a tenured faculty member outside the committee chair's/co-chairs' home department(s) OR a faculty member outside the primary college of the committee chair/co-chairs. If the student is in an interdisciplinary program, the GSR must also be outside of that program. Additionally, the GSR must be clear of any conflicts of interest with either the student or the committee chair/co-chairs. Examples of possible conflicts of interest may include budgetary relationships, family or financial, personal relationships, or research and/or publication relationships between the GSR and either the student or the committee chair. The role of the GSR is to ensure that Graduate College policies are followed, that the expectations for the student's performance are reasonable, and that the interactions between the student and the supervisory committee are conducted in a professional and equitable manner. Graduate School Representatives serving on a committee for a program that has been approved by the Graduate College to use an outcomes-based approach to assess doctoral student performance also have the responsibility to document that the process and assessment of the student's performance in the doctoral program match the defined program outcomes. The GSR signs preliminary and final examination reports to confirm that these standards have been met. Plan of Study The Plan of Study should be submitted to the Graduate College for approval no later than the term immediately after the supervisory committee is formed and must be filed in the Graduate School prior to scheduling the comprehensive/preliminary examination. Revisions may be made, with the Request for Change form, later as advisable and necessary, but must be approved by the student, adviser, the administrator of the student's program, and the graduate dean.798 Doctoral Degree Policies Each program has the responsibility of defining the requirements for a major in its disciplinary area.

IRB, IBC, and/or IACUC Approval If a proposed graduate research project involves human, animal, or biohazard subjects, it must be submitted for review and approval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and/or the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). This process should be initiated by the student after his or her supervisory committee has approved the final research design, because IRB, IBC, and/or IACUC approval must be obtained before the research project commences and cannot be granted retroactively. A copy of the appropriate approval letters are to be included when the dissertation is submitted for editing. Disquisitions that involve research using humans or animals as subjects or using biohazard materials will not be approved by the Graduate College if such research has not been previously approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), or Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) as appropriate. Every effort should be made by advisers to ensure that students are aware of these University requirements. Examinations The supervisory committee shall serve as the examining committee of which the major adviser shall serve as chair. A comprehensive/preliminary examination will be required of each student after the greater portion of courses has been completed. This examination consists of a written part and an oral part. After passing the comprehensive/preliminary examination, the student will be formally admitted to candidacy for the Doctor of Philosophy degree. At least one academic semester must elapse between the comprehensive/preliminary examination and the final examination. The final examination will be taken after the candidate has completed the course work and dissertation. This oral examination will be concerned primarily with the dissertation, but it may also cover material from course work, especially those courses fundamental to the dissertation. The dissertation in a near final form must be given to the committee members at least seven (7) days prior to the final examination. Once a date is finalized with the student's supervisory committee, the Notification of Scheduled Examination form (http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/ gradschool.ndsu.edu/Forms/Student_Forms/Request_to_Schedule_01.pdf) must be filed with the Graduate College at least two (2) weeks prior to the examination. At the conclusion of each oral examination, the examining committee shall record, in writing, its approval or disapproval of the candidate and file the appropriate report of examination form to the Graduate College within seven (7) days of the exam. A negative vote by more than one member of the student's committee will signify failure of either the comprehensive/preliminary examination or the final examination. Upon permission of a majority of the supervisory committee members, a candidate is allowed to take each examination twice. The supervisory committee will set a date at least one month after the failed examination. Exception to this time limit will be considered by the Dean of the Graduate College upon presentation of written justification from the chair of the supervisory committee in consultation with the committee members. Should both attempts to pass an examination result in failure, the candidate may request to take the examination a third time. A request for a third examination requires the support of the supervisory committee and program administrator, and the approval of the Dean of the Graduate College after consultation with the Graduate Council. Continuous enrollment is required (fall and spring semester) until all degree requirements are completed, including Graduate School approval of the dissertation. Students defending in the summer semester must register for summer semester. To participate in commencement, the student must have passed the final examination seven days prior to the commencement ceremony. Dissertation Video Doctoral students are required to submit a three-minute video summarizing their dissertation research for a lay audience. The video should be produced during the final semester of study (specific timing varies by program). Some programs require these videos to be shown to the supervisory committee at the time of final defense, while others do not. Students should consult with their adviser regarding program policies. At a minimum, a student cannot successfully produce the video until the results of his or her research are known.North Dakota State University 801 Dissertation The dissertation must show originality and demonstrate the student's capacity for independent research. It must embody results of research that constitute a definitive contribution to knowledge. Filing the Dissertation After the final examination, the student incorporates all revisions into the disquisition as required by the supervisory committee. Once the corrections are made, students must submit the following items to the Graduate School: signed approval page IRB/IACUC/IBC Compliance Notification disquisition disquisition processing fee The student will have one (1) year from the date of the final examination to complete the Graduate School disquisition review process and all other degree requirements.

A degree posts at the end of the semester in which the disquisition is approved and other degree requirements are completed. Graduate Certificate Policies The goal of Graduate Certificate programs at NDSU is to provide course experiences that form a distinct knowledge or skill set identified as a named certificate. Admission Students who are currently in a degree program who wish to pursue a certificate program must complete the Add a Certificate to a Degree (http:// www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/gradschool.ndsu.edu/Forms/Student_Forms/Add_Certificate.pdf) form available on the Graduate School webpage. Applicants not currently in a degree program must: 1.Have a baccalaureate degree from an educational institution of recognized standing. 2.Provide official transcripts from each college or university in which they have been enrolled or are currently enrolled (including both undergraduate and graduate course work). 3.Be approved for admission by the program administrator hosting the graduate certificate program and by the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies. 4.Provide a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or IELTS (International English Language Testing System) score equivalent to that needed for the degree programs in the unit. This is required of ALL applicants whose native language is not English. *NOTE: Admission into a Graduate Certificate program does not guarantee admission into a graduate degree program nor imply the waiver of any requirements for admission into a graduate degree program. A separate application is required for admission to another degree granting program. Completion 1.Only grades of C or higher will satisfy requirements for course completion. Cumulative GPA on all credits taken at NDSU must be 3.0 or better. 2.Candidates apply for certificate issuance using a form provided by the Graduate College. 3.Courses used to satisfy the Graduate Certificate program requirements cannot be older than seven (7) years at the time the certificate completion is verified. 4.Transcripts will list Graduate Certificate as the name of the completed certificate program. 5.Credits earned toward completion of a certificate also may be used toward the completion of a master's degree. Origination and planning of each certificate will occur within Graduate Certificate program committees hosted by an academic program. Interdisciplinary programs are encouraged to create certificate programs, and in such cases, primary contributors will be listed as host programs. Administration of Certificates The Graduate College oversees the administration of all graduate certificate programs. 1.Certificate programs may be housed in an academic department or be part of a graduate interdisciplinary program. The department chair or the program director may administer the certificate program or may designate a certificate program coordinator. The program coordinator will be802 Graduate Assistantship Policy responsible for all aspects of the program, including admission, student tracking, and signing the student's Verification of Certificate. Programs are encouraged to have a coordinating committee oversee program assessment, curriculum, and other matters. The student's Verification of Certificate form must be signed by at least two individuals associated with the program, such as the program coordinator and the chair or director. One of the individuals signing the Verification of Certificate form must be a full member of the Graduate Faculty. 2.The program coordinator will provide outcome or descriptive information to the Graduate College that will establish and maintain a website to advertise and explain NDSU graduate certificate programs to potential candidates. The site will list admission requirements and courses for each certificate. The Graduate College must be sure that the site is updated at least annually. 3.Since a certificate is not a degree track, federal Title IV student financial assistance and tuition waivers will not be available for certificate students. 4.Current students may also pursue Graduate Certificate programs. 5.Program administrators will monitor and report certificate completions in program reviews, annual reports, and other summative documents. Faculty should be given credit for certificate participation in merit/tenure considerations. Approval Process for Graduate Certificate Programs The approval process will be the same as that of degree programs. The usual supporting documentation is outlined at www.ndsu.edu/facultysenate/ acadaffairs/. Signatures are required from: 1.Program administrator(s) of academic program(s) 2.College Curriculum Committee 3.Academic Dean 4.Graduate Council and Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies 5.University Academic Affairs Committee 6.Faculty Senate 7.State Board of Higher Education Curriculum Development 1.Committees will develop programs with a minimum of eight (8)* credits in specific graduate-level courses which can be completed preferably within one year but no more than three years. *Different certificates may have higher credit requirements. 2.Transfer credit may not be applied to a certificate program. Graduate Assistantship Policy Graduate assistants are typically full-time graduate students who participate in teaching, research, or administrative activities in exchange for financial support at North Dakota State University. Graduate assistantships contribute to student professional development with the primary purpose of assisting students in the successful completion of their academic program. Students placed on Academic Warning may retain their assistantship. Students placed on Probation may no longer receive an assistantship. Graduate assistantships may be awarded outside of the student's home program. These assistantships require the continued approval of the graduate program administrator of the student's program, the student's adviser and the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies. Assistantship appointments may vary in length and are contingent upon the availability of funding. Some assistantships are granted for one academic term or year with reappointment dependent upon performance review. Other assistantships are for multiple years with annual performance reviews. A graduate assistantship can also involve research or teaching experiences conducted at an off-campus entity, such as a university, agency, or business. In these instances, the experience should be clearly linked to the student's program of study and involve a collaborative relationship between NDSU and the outside entity. Fellowships may be awarded by NDSU or by an outside entity (e.g., a foundation, a government, etc.). Fellowships may require some specific activities, including work in a laboratory or teaching. If a fellowship includes specific activities, the guidelines established in this policy apply. Eligibility for Assistantships Recommendations for assistantships are made to the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies and are subject to the dean's approval. Graduate programs may have specific requirements for eligibility. Before any assistantship can be awarded, students must be admitted to the Graduate School as a degree-seeking student. The tuition waiver may be reduced by other financial awards directed specifically to pay tuition.North Dakota State University 803 Students must be registered for credit each semester (fall and spring) they receive an assistantship, and must be in good academic standing and maintaining satisfactory progress toward their degree. In addition, international students must maintain the appropriate residency status. Teaching assistants whose native language is not English must demonstrate English proficiency (refer to section titled \"English Language Proficiency Procedures for Graduate Teaching Assistants\"). Students offered a graduate teaching or graduate service assistantship must consent to a criminal background check. Students placed on Academic Warning may retain their assistantship. Students placed on Probation may no longer receive an assistantship. Expectations of Program/Assistantship Supervisor Each graduate program must develop a procedure for the awarding of graduate assistantships. The Graduate College requires that a contract be provided to all graduate assistants. This document would specify expectations for the assistantship, including number of hours of work, stipend amount, activities, etc. Programs/assistantship supervisors must provide periodic oral and written assessment and feedback regarding a graduate assistant's performance. This feedback should document areas where improvement is needed, and graduate assistants should be given adequate time to improve in those areas. Feedback should be provided annually at a minimum. Expectations of Graduate Assistant Students must dedicate the required number of hours assigned to work each week. Graduate assistants must work a minimum of 10 hours per week for 16 weeks, and must receive at least minimum wage. Graduate assistantships cannot exceed 20 hours per week. Students on full-time assistantships are generally discouraged from having additional off-campus employment. Students receiving a graduate assistantship or fellowship are expected to maintain good academic standing and satisfactory progress toward their degrees. Please refer to the section on Graduate College Policies for more information. Students receiving a graduate assistantship are expected to complete required trainings annually (e.g., Baseline Safety Training, Sexual Harassment Prevention Training, Title IX Training) within 30 days of accepting their appointment. Failure to complete training can lead to sanctions, including revocation of the tuition waiver and termination of the assistantship. Students receiving a graduate assistantship are expected to fulfill their responsibilities adhering to the professional and academic expectations of their discipline and in compliance with NDUS and NDSU policies. Violations of these policies and expectations may result in sanctions, including loss of the assistantship and/or termination from the Graduate College. Adjudication of these violations will occur using NDSU Policy 335.1. Students on research assistantships may also do related research for course credit. The number of hours of work per credit may vary depending on the discipline/department. Stipend Levels and Tuition Waivers Graduate assistantship stipends vary by discipline. A full-time assistantship consists of 20 hours/week. For information on the current minimum stipend level for a full assistantship, refer to graduate student handbooks for the specific department and/or departmental website information. Departments may award stipends of less than the full-time amount, but they must reduce the workload accordingly. The responsibilities associated with a graduate assistantship may vary in nature. The hour commitment defined by an assistantship may be averaged across a given time period. For example, a teaching assistantship of 20 hours/week should total to 320 hours across the 16 weeks of the academic term. In these cases, students should be given adequate advance notice of these variable expectations so that they can adjust their schedules to meet the requirements of the assistantship. Supervisors must also remain sensitive to the academic demands faced by graduate students. Students receiving graduate assistantships also receive tuition waivers to cover base tuition for regular NDSU graduate credits only. Students are responsible for any differential tuition, student fees, and tuition for other types of credits taken, such as undergraduate credits, Distance and Continuing Education credits or Cooperative Education credits. To be eligible for a tuition waiver, the assistantship must be at least 160 hours per semester and must pay at least the federal minimum wage. Partial tuition waivers are not given when a graduate assistant works less than 160 hours in the semester. Students who, for any reason, do not complete a minimum of 160 hours in a given semester will not be eligible for that semester's waiver and will be billed for the tuition. The tuition waiver may have limitations depending on the assistantship appointment. To be eligible for a summer tuition waiver, a student must have department approval and have received a tuition waiver for the preceding or the following academic term (spring or fall semester). Students eligible for a graduate assistantship waiver may not also receive other NDSU tuition waivers. If a student is eligible for more than one waiver, the waiver which results in the highest tuition to be waived will be applied. Additional Employment at NDSU or in the NDUS Graduate assistants on full assistantships are not allowed to work on a second assistantship, as part-time instructors, as student workers, or in any other capacity for NDSU, any other campus in the North Dakota University System, or State of North Dakota agency or office while working as a graduate assistant, unless an exception is approved by the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies prior to the work being performed .804 English Language Proficiency Procedure for Graduate Teaching Assistants Exceptions may be granted for up to six (6) additional hours (a total of no more than 26 total hours for the assistantship plus additional work). Additional work performed during the winter or spring breaks is allowed. Additional hours may also be appropriate during the summer term, depending upon the student's credit load for the summer term. Any of these exceptions must be recommended in writing by the student's supervisor, approved by the student's adviser and the student's department or program administrator, and forwarded to the Graduate College PRIOR to submission of the payroll form. The approval should then be attached to the payroll form. These steps must be completed in the order described and before the student begins work. Rights and Privileges of Graduate Assistants Graduate assistants have certain rights and privileges specific to the assistantship experience: The right to be notified in writing of all decisions that affect their status as a graduate assistant. This includes advance notification of evaluation procedures and a summary of their performance evaluation. The right to be notified of any complaints received by a supervisor or department chair concerning their performance of duties. The right to respond in writing to such complaints. The right, depending on the availability of departmental and university resources, to be supported in pursuing additional activities that pertain to their professional development. The right to balance their assistantship responsibilities with their responsibilities to their academic program so that they can complete their degree in a timely manner. The privilege of being treated as a professional in their chosen field of study. Termination Graduate assistants may have their assistantship terminated by the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies, upon recommendation by their supervisor, with documentation of probable cause. Early termination for cause may occur when: A student does not abide by the appointment conditions. A student fails to perform tasks as assigned. A student does not make adequate degree progress. A student is placed on Academic Probation. A student does not make satisfactory research progress. A student fails to maintain minimum registration. A student persistently refuses to follow reasonable advice and counsel of faculty in carrying out assistantship obligations. A student fails to comply with responsibilities as an employee set forth in the Graduate Bulletin , department rules and regulations governing assistantships, or the terms of sponsored research agreements that fund the assistantship. A student's personal conduct is seriously prejudicial to the university, including violation of the NDSU Code of Student Behavior, state or federal law, and general university regulations. Appeals Process The North Dakota State University philosophy is to encourage and seek resolution of problems at the level most closely related to the origin of the specific disputes. This means: The first step should be an informal conference to first discuss and attempt to resolve the problem(s) with the person(s) directly involved. When a mutually satisfactory resolution cannot be reached or if discussion of the problem(s) seems inappropriate because of the nature of the student's complaint, the student should seek advice from the director of the program, chair of the department, or the graduate coordinator. Depending on the nature of the problem(s), the department chair or student's graduate committee chair may deal with the situation directly, advise the student to discuss the problem(s) with the appropriate academic dean and/or the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies, or advise the student of the appropriate grievance procedure to pursue. If the graduate assistant wishes to challenge the termination decision, a written appeal to the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies must be made within two weeks of notification of the mediation results (refer to section titled \"Graduate Student Appeals\"). Students should not carry more than a full-time load. Individual departments will determine a minimum and a maximum number of credit hours. English Language Proficiency Procedure for Graduate Teaching Assistants 1.All students awarded a Graduate Teaching Assistantship (GTA) involving any type of teaching responsibility, including lectures, labs, or tutoring shall be evaluated with respect to overall communication proficiency during the 3rd week of the first semester of his or her teaching duties. While the format may be determined by individual units, the evaluation must be documented and it must address the comprehensive English proficiency of theNorth Dakota State University 805 teaching assistant, including speaking and listening ability, commensurate with his or her assigned duties. A copy of the evaluation instrument and the results for each teaching assistant shall be made available to the Graduate Dean upon request. In addition to the above evaluation, the following requirements must be met: 2.Domestic GTAs and international GTAs possessing a US bachelor's degree or higher are not required to present a TOEFL score, provided that the degree included a minimum of two years in residence. In all other cases, the requirements in the bullet below apply. 3.International GTAs whose first language is not English and who do not meet the criteria in the bullet above must meet minimal requirements on measures of general English language proficiency, spoken English language proficiency, and written English language proficiency. At the present time, the accepted measure of language proficiency will be the TOEFL ibT, IELTS or the PTE Academic. There will be two recognized categories: Graduate Teaching Assistant s (who have direct contact with students) must have a minimum TOEFL ibT score of 81 (IELTS of 7; PTE Academic equivalent of 54), a TOEFL ibT Speaking subscale score of 23 or above and a TOEFL ibT Writing subscale score of 21 or above. The IELTS equivalent scores are 6.0 for both, and the PTE Academic equivalent scores are 62 and 56, respectively. Graders (who have no direct contact with students) must have a minimum TOEFL ibT score of 79 (IELTS of 6.5; PTE Academic of 53) and must score at or above the 40th percentile on the TOEFL ibT Speaking and Writing subscales (19 and 21, respectively). The IELTS equivalent scores are 5.5 and 6.0 respectively, and the PTE Academic equivalent scores are 51 and 56. Individuals may serve in this capacity for no more than one (1) calendar year. To continue as a GTA, students must meet the GTA requirements listed in the bullet point above OR successfully complete LANG 701 English Language and Classroom Skills for International GTAs and LANG 702 English Language Tutorial for International GTAs.

This means: 1.the student is to first discuss the problem(s) with the person(s) directly involved; 2.if the student is not satisfied after discussing the problem with the person(s) directly involved or if discussion of the problem(s) seems inappropriate because of the nature of the student's complaint, the student should seek advice from the administrator of the program; and 3.depending on the nature of the problem(s), the program administrator or student's supervisory committee chair may deal with the situation directly, advise the student to discuss the problem(s) with the appropriate academic dean and/or the Dean of the Graduate College, or advise the student of the appropriate grievance procedure to pursue.806 Graduate Student Appeals Areas of possible graduate student appeal include equal opportunity, suspension or dismissal from an academic program or the Graduate College, sanctions for academic dishonesty, and degree-acquisition processes that are unique to graduate education. The burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence is on the graduate student making the appeal. Equal Opportunity North Dakota State University's general and specific commitment to being an equal opportunity institution is expressed elsewhere in this bulletin. As stated there, inquiries concerning compliance may be directed to the Vice Provost and Title IX Coordinator (201 Old Main, 701-231-7708, ndsu.eoaa@ndsu.edu) or to the Office for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education, 10220 N. Executive Hills Blvd., 8th Floor, 07-6010, Kansas City, MO 64153-1367. Academic Evaluation The University Senate Grade Appeals Board has the authority to hear charges of inequitable or biased academic evaluations and to provide redress for any improper evaluations as it may find to have actually taken place. This is for course grades assigned by instructors in charge of the courses. This includes grades of disquisition courses. The \"Rights & Responsibilities of Community: A Code of Student Behavior,\" (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/ policy/601.pdf) Section 337 of the NDSU Policy Manual, has the procedural details. Salient points repeated here are that the student must initiate a request for a change of grade with the instructor within 15 instructional days of the first day of the semester immediately following the semester in which the grade was awarded. During an actual appeal, the burden of proof is on the student. The Grade Appeals Board procedures are for student grievances against instructors over course grades assigned. Academic Dishonesty All other appeals are addressed through the Graduate College appeal process. These appeals may address suspension or dismissal from a graduate program or the Graduate College, sanctions for academic misconduct or dishonesty, and degree-acquisition processes that are unique to graduate education. Procedures dealing with issues of academic dishonesty in meeting course requirements, such as cheating, plagiarism, or other academic improprieties brought by instructors against students enrolled in their course(s) or other NDSU course(s) or persons not enrolled at NDSU but viewed by the instructor as involved in the academic dishonesty are detailed in both the \"Rights & Responsibilities of Community: A Code of Student Behavior\" and Section 335 of the NDSU Policy Manual referenced in the preceding paragraph. A substantial range of penalties to the student(s) is available to the instructor(s) and academic dean(s) of the college(s) involved, i.e., the college offering the course(s) and the college of which the student(s) is (are) a member. One option available to the deans is to recommend suspension or expulsion from the university. A student may choose to appeal the assignment of a grade in a course in which academic misconduct has occurred to the Grade Appeals Board. The decision to impose any additional penalty or disciplinary sanction for prohibited academic conduct against a graduate student in meeting the requirements of either an undergraduate or graduate course may be appealed by said graduate student to a graduate student appeals committee, provided there is documentation in writing of consultation with instructor(s), program administrator(s), and dean(s), in sequence, to resolve the conflict. This appeal starts with a written notice to the Dean of the Graduate College. The written notice must be accompanied by the aforementioned documentation and must be received by the Dean of the Graduate College within two weeks of the most recent date on the documentation. There are processes and activities that are intrinsic to the acquisition of a graduate degree. The processes include specification of degree requirements, preliminary and qualifying examinations, disquisition writing and approval, and possible suspension or dismissal from the program or the Graduate College. The activities for which faculty have primary responsibility include instructing students enrolled in courses; mentoring students; collecting, analyzing, and presenting for public consumption the subsequent results and conclusions; and possibly working with proprietary information. Problems in these areas are to be discussed with the chair of the graduate student supervisory committee and administrator of the program, in that order. Normally, these faculty members will attempt to work out a resolution of any problem by bringing the parties involved together in an informal, non- adversarial manner. Inquiry at this stage is usually limited to a determination of 1) whether the graduate student has been treated in an arbitrary or capricious manner or in some way not consistent with previously announced policy guidelines or 2) whether the graduate student has acted in a manner inconsistent with formal or traditional standards of academic conduct. Conflicts not satisfactorily resolved at the program level are to be brought to the academic dean who will discuss the problem(s) with all interested parties. If resolution does not result at the academic dean level, an appeal can be brought to a graduate student appeals committee, as long as there is documentation in writing that the graduate student has consulted the graduate student's supervisory committee chair, the program administrator, and the academic dean in attempts to resolve the conflict. This appeal starts with a written notice to the Dean of the Graduate College. This written notice must be accompanied by the aforementioned documentation and must be received by the Dean of the Graduate College within six weeks of the most recent date on the documentation. Graduate Student Appeals Committee The Dean of the Graduate College is responsible for forming graduate student appeals committees and informing the committee members of their duties. The Dean of the Graduate College will serve as an ex-officio and nonvoting member. A graduate student appeals committee has five members, all of whom must be graduate faculty or currently enrolled graduate students. Four graduate faculty members will be selected at random from the membership of the Graduate Council. A graduate student member of the committee will be selected from a pool of graduate students that includes the student members of the Graduate Council and four students nominated by the Graduate Student Council (this pool will be created at the start of eachNorth Dakota State University 807 academic year). The administrator(s) and dean(s) of the program(s) and college(s) involved cannot be members of the committee. The five committee members elect the chair of the committee from its membership. The graduate student and the party or parties against whom the complaint has been brought each have the right to challenge, with cause, to the Dean of the Graduate College one member of the graduate student appeals committee. The burden of proof shall be with the appealing graduate student. The appealing graduate student has the right to 1) be given due notice in sufficient detail that the accusation is clear and the circumstances of the accusation are detailed enough for meaningful response by the accused and 2) be heard by an impartial body. Each contending party may, if it wishes, be accompanied by one counsel, but any counseling is restricted to 1) what to ask, 2) when not to respond to a question, and 3) how to answer a question. Counsel may not intrude on the hearing. The appeals committee is not bound by rules of legal evidence or procedure and may develop procedures that its members consider to be fair and equitable to the particular circumstance(s). The chair of the committee will preside over the hearing. The hearing will include an opening statement by both the student and the party or parties against whom the complaint has been brought, questioning by the appeals committee, and brief closing statements by the student and the party or parties against whom the complaint has been brought. Committee members make decisions on available information; non-response to questions is available information, i.e., a negative inference can be drawn from the lack of a response. The hearing will be closed unless the student signs a release waiving his or her rights to a closed hearing. The hearing, but not the appeals committee's deliberations, will be tape-recorded. The decisions and recommendations of the appeals committee shall be by majority vote and will be advisory to the Dean of the Graduate College, who will then be responsible for taking appropriate action(s). Any further appeal shall be directed to the President of the University. Graduate Faculty Full Graduate Faculty Graduate education is dedicated to the continued scholarship and professional development of our students. The Graduate College at NDSU sets as the defining principle of graduate education the formation of a special professional relationship between students and program faculty. This professional relationship culminates through mentorship that is developed between a student and a faculty mentor. In recognition of the role of graduate education, and the importance of mentorship, the Graduate College identifies individuals as being members of the Graduate faculty. This faculty should teach and mentor graduate students. Programs should strive to have courses taught by Graduate Faculty members and student advisory committees composed of Graduate Faculty members. Graduate Faculty status confers certain rights, privileges, and responsibilities to individuals holding this status. The following sections define the various recognized levels of Graduate Faculty membership and the rights pertaining to each. Full Member of the Graduate Faculty Full-status members of the Graduate Faculty of North Dakota State University (NDSU) consist of all persons who hold a probationary (tenure-track) or tenured appointment and have been appointed to the rank of Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, or Professor in an academic unit or program area at NDSU. A full-status member of the Graduate Faculty of NDSU may teach graduate courses, serve as a member of supervisory committees, chair supervisory committees, serve as the Graduate College appointee to supervisory committees, serve as a member of graduate student appeals committees, serve as a member of the Graduate Council, vote at graduate faculty meetings, and serve in any other capacity as required.

Affiliate Members of the Graduate Faculty are qualified by educational background and experience to effectively teach and mentor students in graduate programs at NDSU. An appointment for Affiliate Graduate Faculty status is initiated by a graduate program. The chair, head, or director of the academic unit in which the program resides will submit the Affiliate Graduate Faculty Nomination form (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/ gradschool.ndsu.edu/Forms/Faculty_Staff_Documents/Affiliate_Faculty.pdf) and a current curriculum vita. The request should include the level of Affiliate Faculty Membership the program proposes the applicant should be given. This request is forwarded to the dean of the academic college in which the program resides for approval. If approved, the request is submitted to the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies. The request will be reviewed by a subcommittee of the Graduate Council which will make a recommendation to the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary studies, who will determine whether an appointment will be granted. A reappointment may be granted using the process described above. Members of the Graduate Faculty who have left the institution may be granted Affiliate Faculty status as outlined below: Emeritus Faculty. Persons who are granted emeritus faculty status are eligible for Affiliate Faculty Level 1 status for a period of three years. Membership as an Affiliate Faculty may be renewed upon approval of the Graduate Council and the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies. Individuals who have retired or left NDSU for other employment opportunities are eligible serve as chair of supervisory committees for one year. This is not renewable. A department may nominate the individual for Affiliate Faculty status as outlined below. There are three levels of Affiliate Graduate Faculty Members, the appointment level will be determined by the qualifications of the applicant. Affiliate Graduate Faculty Level 1 Duties Chair committees for graduate students Serve on committees for all students Teach graduate courses826 Graduate Faculty Criteria Terminal degree Sustained record of scholarly and/or creative accomplishment Demonstrated competence in instruction including classroom, advising, or mentoring Full-time Employment at an NDSU on-campus unit or a Research and Extension Center Term 6 years Must demonstrate sustained record of scholarly and/or creative accomplishment Demonstrated competence in graduate instruction including classroom, advising, or mentoring Affiliate Graduate Faculty Level 2 Duties Chair committees for all master's students Serve as co-chair for all doctoral students (the other co-chair must be a full member of the graduate faculty) Serve on committees for all students Teach graduate courses Criteria Terminal degree Record of scholarly or creative accomplishment Demonstrated experience in teaching, mentoring, or advising Term 3 years Must demonstrate sustained record of scholarly or creative accomplishment Demonstrated competence in graduate teaching, advising, or mentoring Affiliate Graduate Faculty Level 3 Duties Chair committees for students not required to complete a dissertation, thesis, or scholarly paper Serve on committees for all students Teach graduate courses (but no higher than his/her earned degree) Criteria Record of professional achievement in an area related to the program Demonstrated competence in teaching Term 3 years Must demonstrate sustained record of professional achievement in an area related to the program Active involvement in graduate teaching and work with graduate students (but no higher than his/her earned degree) Graduate Teaching Waivers Graduate teaching waivers may be granted to individuals who do not meet the requirements for either full or associate graduate faculty status. Teaching waivers only allow individuals to serve as the instructor of record for graduate level courses and carry none of the other privileges of graduate faculty status. Waivers may be granted to qualified individuals who are not students in the department for which the waiver is sought. Graduate teaching waivers may be granted to individuals who do not meet the requirements for either full or associate graduate faculty status. Graduate teaching waivers should be granted sparingly. A request for a waiver should include a rationale for why the individual nominated is the best choice for teaching the particular course. Teaching waivers are most appropriate for elective courses or courses in applied/professional programs for which experiences gained by professionals will provide a valuable educational opportunity for the students. Teaching waivers should not be requested for required courses in aNorth Dakota State University 827 program, unless no other viable alternative exists. The request for teaching waivers should not be seen as a long-term solution to inadequate numbers of tenure-track faculty members. Thus departments will also be asked to explain their long-term plan to fill any deficiencies in their ability to offer courses for which a waiver is requested. The burden of proof lies with the applying graduate program to show that the nominee holds qualifications that merit the granting of a graduate teaching waiver. A Graduate Teaching Waiver Request form (http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/gradschool.ndsu.edu/Graduate_Council_Documents/ Graduate_Teaching_Waiver_Request.pdf) must be completed with a current copy of the nominee's curriculum vitae and any other pertinent documentation attached. Graduate teaching waivers are approved by the Graduate Council and the Dean of the Graduate College. Waivers are granted for one academic year and may be renewed twice at the discretion of the Dean of the Graduate College.828 Summer Session Summer Session The 12-week summer session is designed to provide coursework within various time intervals. Classes typically are offered in either the full 12-week session, the standard four-week session begins in May, or the standard eight-week session that begins in June. There are many other short or variable length courses throughout the summer. While the time interval of the individual sessions is different than that of the standard semester, each course carries full credit because classes meet the same number of contact hours as in the standard semester. Each college or department determines its summer offerings, based upon previous enrollments, programmatic needs, and special requests. Special effort is made to offer courses approved for fulfilling general education requirements. The summer session course offerings schedule (https:// www.ndsu.edu/registrar/academics/schedule) is available online. For information on summer school, please call 231-8492 or 231-6133. Fees and Housing Student, Course, and Program Fees (http://www.ndsu.edu/bisonconnection/accounts/tuition) are available online. Information concerning summer housing may be secured by contacting the Department of Residence Life (https://www.ndsu.edu/reslife) , Dept. University Tri-College University (https://www.tri-college.org) (TCU) is a consortium of five regional institutions of higher education: NDSU, Concordia College (https://www.concordiacollege.edu) , Minnesota State University Moorhead , Minnesota State Community and Technical College (http://www.minnesota.edu) , and North Dakota State College of Science (https://www.ndscs.edu) . Students at the five schools may benefit from what each institution offers individually and cooperatively through the consortium. Through the Tri-College course exchange, students enrolled at one campus may take courses at the other institutions at no extra cost and without going through separate admission procedures. Tri-College expands discipline offerings and course availability for students beyond their home campus. Tuition and Fees Tuition is paid to the home campus. Courses not eligible for Tri-College registration are those offered online through NDSU and NDSCS, off-campus or weekend courses offered through MSUM's Continuing Education program, most workshops, most graduate courses, independent study courses at Concordia College, private music instruction at Concordia, and international travel programs. Students enrolling in classes that require special fees (lab/course fees, lessons, supplies, etc.) beyond the home-campus tuition and fees assessed at the time of registration will be responsible for remittance of payment to the provider institution. Course Limits The TCU Course Exchange is limited to one course per student per semester per participating campus, and only if the course is not catalogued or offered on the student's home campus in a given semester. Exceptions to the one course/semester limit among campuses are detailed, along with other TCU registration information, on the TCU Registration Information Guide (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/registrar/forms/tcu-info.pdf) . All students must be registered at their home campus before being eligible to enroll in Tri-College courses (excludes summer for MSUM and NDSU). Concordia students \u2014and NDSU students wanting to take a course at Concordia\u2014may take only one course per term and then, only if they are full-time students and only if that course is not available on their home campus during that academic term. Concordia does not participate in the TCU course exchange during the summer. Credits and Grades Courses taken through TCU course exchange will appear on a student's home campus transcript within the respective term and may be applied toward graduation requirements. Credits and grades are calculated into home campus grade point averages and cumulative totals. Course Substitutions Students need to obtain advanced approval to substitute TCU courses for required courses in a major or minor, unless otherwise stipulated in the major/ minor requirements. Course Repeats Students taking a TCU course to repeat a course previously taken at the home campus must indicate this on the Tri-College Registration Form (https:// www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/registrar/forms/tcu-registration.pdf) . Duplication of credit is not permitted. Policies and Deadlines Students must observe all registration and academic policies and deadlines of their home campus, including arrangements for withdrawals, drops/adds, pass/fail options, audits, and incomplete grades. Registration NDSU students register by submitting the Tri-College Registration Form (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/registrar/forms/tcu-registration.pdf) to the Office of Registration and Records, 110 Ceres Hall. Tri-College Minors The Tri-College partners recognize minors earned through the TCU course exchange. Students receive recognition on their academic transcript for minors completed on one of the other TCU campuses. This policy applies only to minors earned in programs not available on a student's home-campus. The Tri-College Minor Form (http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/registrar/forms/tcu-minor.pdf) is available online. Majors Majors may be earned only at the school from which a student earns a degree. Most students enroll initially at the school from which they intend to graduate. However, the TCU course exchange agreement between MSUM and NDSU allows a student to begin their studies at one of the schools prior to transferring to the other school to complete their degree. Tri-college students typically are restricted to pre-professional coursework at a campus that830 Tri-College University offers a professional program of study. Students should work with the chair of the department in which they intend to major to make sure their program includes all requirements for the major and for graduation. Library Services Students, faculty, and staff of the TCU institutions may use all of the libraries in the consortia. Circulating materials from TCU libraries are available free of charge for direct checkout or through inter-library loan. A regional computer-based catalog shows availability of materials at the TCU and other libraries. Bus and Parking Services A Tri-College bus schedule provides inter-campus transportation to Concordia, MSUM, and NDSU every half hour. The bus is operated weekdays by the City of Fargo during the NDSU/MSUM academic year; it is not available during the summer. Bus schedules are available at the TCU office and at several locations on each campus. A separate parking permit is not issued for Tri College University parking. If vehicles have a current home-campus permit, they may be parked in the following lots on other campuses. Concordia: TCU students, faculty, and staff can park in Parking Lot C (https://www.concordiacollege.edu/admission-aid/visit-campus/campus-map) . MSUM: TCU students can park in Lots P and K (https://www.mnstate.edu/parking) . TCU faculty and staff may park in Lots P, K, and F (https:// www.mnstate.edu/parking) . NDSU: Parking Lots R, TA and Fargo Dome lots B, C and D (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/parking/docs/NDSU_Parking_lots_map.pdf) . Faculty/ staff permits are honored in the T1 lot. Individuals with state-issued mobility-impaired permits may park in any mobility-impaired space on campus provided the Tri-College institution permit and the state-issued mobility-impaired permit are clearly displayed in conjunction with one another. MState: Apply for free parking at the Moorhead campus. NDSCS: contact Campus Police in the Student Center (https://www.ndscs.edu/campus-map) for parking permit information. All drivers are subject to traffic regulations of the respective institutions. Lot restrictions are eased after 5 p.m., and there is no overnight parking.North Dakota State University 831 Course Catalog Descriptions Course Definitions, Designators, and Format (p. 831) Course Descriptions (p. 833) Course Definitions and Format Courses approved at the time of publication are listed in this bulletin.
