It seems theoutcomes of scientific research often are more prized than the work itself.Certainly, the number of students choosing careersin academic medicine is alarmingly low. It has cometo the point where we need to seriously ask the ques-tion\u2014will there be a generation after this one to fillthe role of medical school faculty? We are establishing a program here at the medical school to abate the debt of those who choose careers as physician-scientists. But an interestingquestion remains: How do we know which applicants, students, and young MDs are creativeenough to pursue and enjoy fruitful research careers? One thing is clear, GPA is not a tellingindicator of future success as a scientist. It also is easy to imagine that achievement in science may not depend only on mathemati- cal/logical intelligence. One needs to reach some threshold of global intelligence.Wordsmithery (linguistic intelligence) helps, though it is not enough to promise an inspiredscientific research career. How one theorizes about the trafficking of intracellular organellesmay depend, in part, upon a spatial or even a kinesthetic intelligence. And as Thomas Starzl'swork with microchimerism so well illustrates (see story on page 31), to move from creativescientist to the realm of paradigm shifter, one must have all of this as well as the independenceof thought to remain steadfast in the face of contention. So, for the School of Medicine to grow the ranks of inspired physician-scientists, we must ourselves be creative. As a starting point, our admissions committee is looking beyondtypical parameters when winnowing through medical student applications. Once we entice young people to choose academic careers, we must foster their creativity. The current state of academic medicine\u2014which requires managing competing clinical,teaching, business, and research demands\u2014can tax the most fertile mind. And a recentstudy of women's faculty issues here has revealed other concerns that are applicable to bothmen and women: The logistics of the two-career family can put research careers in peril.Many young faculty members are dealing with child-care issues while contending with thepressures of the tenure track system. Consequently, we are establishing an office to addressthese and other career development issues of our health sciences faculty. Not only must we value and encourage creativity, we must give faculty\u2014and future gen- erations of faculty\u2014the opportunity to cultivate it. Arthur S.

From 1989 to 1998, Pitt's annual share rose to $170 million and 580 grants a year. This news puts Pitt in the company of institutions such as Johns Hopkins, Yale, and the University of Pennsylvania. The only other new entrant to the list is Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. A P R I L 3 Devoted to noteworthy happenings at the medical school. . .

SurgiScope, a ceiling-mounted robotic guidance system, is helpingneurosurgeons steer through the most delicate of terrain\u2014the damaged brain. SurgiScope guides surgeons through the intricacies of the brain by correlating brain scans with a high powered microscope and robotic arms. With the use of infrared cam-eras, the microscope is lined up and calibrated to a patient's head. According to L. DadeLunsford, L\u00e4rs-Leksell professor and chairperson of the Department of Neurological Surgeryat the School of Medicine, this system, with its interactive software and continually updatedvisual images, allows neurosurgeons to pinpoint and remove tumors while minimizing dam-age to healthy tissue. The results: smaller incisions, shorter surgical procedures, more preciseremoval of lesions, and an overall decreased risk for patients. SurgiScope, which navigates areasof the brain that are otherwise impossible to behold during surgery, is giving surgeons the visionto tackle new approaches and expand the realm in which they can help their patients. -TMSurgiScopeFaculty Snapshots ASAMPLING OF SOME OF THE PITT SCHOOL OF MEDICINE FACULTY'S WORK : Eugene N. Myers , chair of the Department of Otolaryngology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, received an $11.2 million grant from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research to establish an Oral Cancer Center. During the last three decades, there has been little change in the success rate of oral cancer therapies\u2014the available treatments are often painful and disfiguring for the patient.Myers, director of the center, hopes to improve treatment and diagnostic options and increase awareness oforal cancer, which will affect almost 30,000 people in the United States this year. Henry Lowe, associate professor of medicine and director of Pitt's Clinical Multimedia Laboratory, received a grant from the National Library of Medicine for further development of the Chart EngineSystem. The project, a multimedia electronic medical record system, integrates clinical images\u2014like X rays, MRIs, CTs, and clinical photos\u2014with text data and laboratory test results using a secure, Internet-based architecture. Ultimately this system may allow clinicians to consult on specific cases while allowing researchers and teachers to access anonymous images for studying diseases and their clinical presentation. John A. Horton III , assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation, won the 1999 Ernest Bors Award from the American Paraplegia Society for his research on the management of urinary tract infections in patients with spinal cord injuries. And by the way, Pitt now has three Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Generalist Physician Faculty Scholars. These awards are given nationally to support research in primary care. Pitt's current scholars include Amy Justice, assistant professor of medicine, who spe- cializes in primary care of patients with HIV, Joseph Conigliaro , assistant professor of medicine, who focuses on prevention of alcohol problems through brief interventions, and Melanie Gold, assistant professor of pediatric and adolescent medicine, who specializes in strategies that focus on prevention of teen pregnancy and STDs. \u2014RS GoldO F N O T E The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine has formed a new Depart-ment of Physical Medicine andRehabilitation (PM & R) in recognitionof Pitt's strong growth in the field.The establishment of this new depart-ment will allow PM & R to becomemore integrated into the educationand research missions of the medicalschool, while moving Pitt into a posi-tion to compete with other PM & Rdepartments for grants and highlyqualified faculty. In addition to its role in the med- ical education of both residents andmedical students, PM & R will coverinpatient and outpa tient services and, in collaboration with severalother University departments, willoffer electromyography and nerveconduction studies, spinal cordinjury and more.Louis E.

Jill Siegfried, professor and vice chair of pharmacology and codirector of the Universityof Pittsburgh Cancer Institute's lung cancerbasic research program, has found a compellingexplanation for why more women than mendevelop lung cancer, caused from their ownsmoking habits or secondary smoke. She and her research team recently found agene on the X chromosome that codesfor a lung-cell receptor\u2014a receptorstimulated by nicotine. Through thisreceptor, this gene causes cells to growand multiply, potentially triggeringtumor formation. Since women, ofcourse, have two X chromosomes, theyare twice as likely to express the genethat can ultimately lead to lung cancer. A man would have to smoke one pack of cigarettes per day for 25 yearsto match a nonsmoking woman's riskof expressing the gene. \"Hopefully, our study will present a powerful argument against smoking inthe work place,\" says Siegfried. \"Thisshould also warn parents, that smoke exposureis causing harm.\" \u2014ST Flashback \"War broke out on December 7th, 1941, when we were freshmen, so everyone in the class of '44who passed the physical was in the army or thenavy\u2014those who weren't got drafted into service.As part of the program, we used to jump from the second floor of Trees Gym into the pool,you know, to simulate jumping off of a ship.Then we'd run to the stadium, down to PantherHollow, around it once, and back up again.

Lots of us have heard or said that line\u2014 many shrug it off under the misconceptionthat it's a myth. But what impact the mindhas on the body and vice versa is a serious question. It has occupied scientists andphilosophers for centuries, and if you askKaren Matthews, professor of psychiatry, epi-demiology, and psychology at the Universityof Pittsburgh School of Medicine, she'll tellyou some serious progress is being madetoward answers. With a $10 million grantfrom NIH, Matthews is now the principalinvestigator of a five-year collaborative proj-ect with Carnegie Mellon University toestablish the Pittsburgh Mind-Body Center. Pittsburgh researchers have been at the forefront of mind-body interactions andhealth for years. They've shown, for example,that women with increased hostility andaggression are more prone to coronary arterydisease, and that a person's risk for respiratoryillnesses is affected by his or her personal rela-tionships. But Matthews wants to focus thisMind over Matter expertise on a broader approach to the mind-body relationship. She wants to study howstress, personal relationships, and other mind-related factors impact health across the board. \"Studies we did locally found that opti- mistic people recovered more quickly fol-lowing bypass surgery. . . and that they livelonger after being diagnosed with breastcancer. So here are illnesses that all suggestoptimism plays a role in either susceptibili-ty or recovery.\" This is what Matthews wants to develop at the center\u2014an understanding of howfactors related to the mind influence multi-ple diseases and how intervention mightaffect recovery. In addition to its research efforts, the center will offer training programs for scien-tists interested in the mind-body relation-ship, as well as seed money for developingprojects. And perhaps, with time, the unan-swered mind-body question will exist onlyin the realm of history. \u2014RS FOR MORE INFORMATION: http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/behavioralmedicine/ JOANNE BARTONE/CIDDE COURTESY MARLON SILVAMatthews8P I T T M E DI N V E S T I G A T I O N S Explorations and revelations taking place at the medical school SWALLOWING A NEW CENTER USES SURPRISINGLY GRACEFUL THERAPEUTICS. |BY REBECCA SKLOOT THE ART OF Swallowing is one of those things you do about 3,000 times a day without thinking much of it. But each successful swallow is, in many ways, an art. A dance of per-fectly coordinated performers: the lips, tongue, teeth, palate, vocal folds, and a host of muscles. At any step along the way, if one movement is out of sync, the swallow cango awry. For some, this means a moment of discomfort\u2014a cough during dinner or a clearedthroat in a moment of silence\u2014but for others, it can mean malnutrition, dehydration, pneu-monia, and even death. PHOTODISCA P R I L 9\"We all take swallowing for granted until a problem shows up,\" says Thomas Murry, pro- fessor of otolaryngology at the University ofPittsburgh School of Medicine. \"People whoclear their throat all the time or cough afterthey drink. . . they're probably unaware thatthey may swallowing to Murry, director of UPMCHealth System's new Swallowing DisordersCenter, about 15 million Americans have swal-lowing disorders. But only some of these prob-lems manifest in clearing throats or coughs. \"We see that group,\" says Murry, \"but the majority of our patients, especially strokepatients and those with neurological disorders,actually needs to be retaught to swallow fromthe ground up.\" With a number like 15 million,it's surprising that Murry directs one of the fewsuch centers in the country. But it's true. The center revolves around what Murry refers to as the swallowing team. The team isled by a speech-language pathologist and relieson professionals dietitians, voice thera-pists, maxillofacial surgeons, neurologists. . .the list goes on. But until recently, says Murry,swallowing disorders weren't treated by a groupof specialists as a unified problem. \"Family doctors treated them, then gas-troenterologists\u2014and they often treated themsuccessfully. But there haven't been any com-prehensive centers simply because treatmentwas fragmented from the start.\" Only 20 years ago, the physiology of swal- lowing and its role in medicine was a wholenew field. \"It was just accepted,\" says Murry, \"that people died in the hospital of pneumoniaafter stroke.\" Often, stroke patients couldn'tswallow food or liquids\u2014so the materialspassed into their lungs instead of their stom-ach, and they developed pneumonia.Fortunately, the incidence of pneumoniadeaths after stroke plummeted as knowledgeof swallowing increased. While other researchers worked toward understanding swallowing physiology, Murryfollowed his own path to exploring swallow-ing disorders. \"It all stems back to my fascination with vocal cords,\" he says. \"They're at the top ofthe airway, so when the vocal cords don'twork, the patient can choke or aspirate.\" This,Murry points out, presents difficult treatmentissues. \"Now, we may all like to talk, but giventhe option, you would rather swallow thantalk. Trust me.\" When a patient walks into the center,Murry's team questions, examines, and search-es for the problem's cause. Once they've foundit, they begin their delicate work toward thefinal goal: a healthy swallow. Their therapeu-tics range from pharmaceuticals to correctivesurgery. But for the majority, swallowing ther-apy is the answer. If swallowing is a dance of precise move- ments, swallowing therapy is where each per-former learns her part. Oral motor exercisesincrease strength and range of motion of thelips, tongue, and jaw. Then, when they'reready, patients learn techniques for sendingfood and liquid in the right direction throughmethods whose names conjure images of therapeutics that the swallowing teambegins choreographing a healthy swallow. In some cases, therapy isn't effective and the team switches to nutrition management,and as a last resort, surgery. In the end, theirwork always comes back to coordination\u2014whether it's a well-executed \"head tilt\" or thebringing together of top-notch specialists.

The device would be placed inthe superior and inferior vena cava, spanning the right atrium.HATTLER INVENTS AN RICH LORD COURTESY OF HATTLERFor Brack Hattler, one tragedy has spawned 16 years of research. In1984, Hattler was a surgeon at Denver's Swedish Porter Hospital, where hetook care of two men in their early twentieswho were in a car accident. Their legs werecrushed, causing a flood of proteins that ledto acute respiratory distress syndrome.Respirators couldn't help, because thepatients' lungs were too distressed to processoxygen. So Hattler, now a professor of sur-gery at Pitt's School of Medicine, hookedthem10P I T T M E D I N V E S T I G A T I O N S HOW BRACK HATTLER 'S(LEFT) IMO WORKS :Oxygen enters the hollow fiber membranes through an external tube and flows through the fibers under vacuum pressure. Then, within each fiber, oxygen diffuses through tiny pores in the fiber wall into the blood, where it is exchanged for carbon dioxide, which diffuses intothe fibers and exits the device through a second tube. Buried within the bundle of fibersis a pulsating central balloon that mixes the blood. By inflating and deflating, the balloondraws blood directly across the fiber. A bonus: Since the balloon pumps the blood overthe fibers, the IMO doesn't get in the way of blood flow returning to the heart. Initial testing looked promising, and at first he expected to have a finished product in afew short years. Then a problem arose thatwould occupy him for more than a decade:Blood that passively flowed through theIMO's membranes wasn't picking up enoughoxygen. By the time he joined the School ofMedicine in 1989, there was still much workto be done. The answer would be to wrap the mem- branes around a 25-cubic-centimeter balloon,which fills with helium and pulsates at 300 or400 beats per minute. When the balloondeflates, it creates a vacuum, drawing bloodthrough the oxygen-rich membranes. Whenit inflates, the blood is pushed away, allowingthe membranes to carry away carbon dioxideand then fill with oxygen again, just in timefor the next influx of blood. Hattler and his team\u2014lab director William Federspiel, Tom Merrill,designer/fabricator Brian Frankowski, chieftechnician Joe Golob, and many others\u2014arenow testing the IMO in large animals. FDAapprovals and clinical trials are next, followedby production by ALung Technologies, Inc.,of Pittsburgh, in partnership withMinneapolis-based Medtronic, Inc. The IMO may lead to bigger break- throughs. \"Everything we're learning about oxy- genating venous blood in the body would bethem up to the only equipment availablethat offered any hope of survival\u2014extracor-poreal membrane oxygenators (ECMOs),which remove blood from the body, addoxygen, then return the blood to the circu-latory system. Though ECMOs can savelives, they also are associated with highmortality rates, he says. \"Both of those young men died, and at that time I began considering that there mightbe a better way of doing this,\" he says. Now Hattler is putting finishing touches on that better way. The intravenous mem-brane oxygenator (IMO) should be on themarket, \"and hopefully lives,\" Hattlersays, within a year. Hattler is developing theIMO at the School of Medicine and Pitt'sMcGowan Center for Artificial OrganDevelopment. Instead of taking the blood out of the body for a lengthy and potentially problem-atic journey through oxygenation machines,the 10-ounce IMO fits into the patient'svena cava and adds the oxygen there.Delivery shafts run from an external oxygensource into the body and to the IMO andcarry away the carbon dioxide shed by theblood. \"It allows the lungs to rest, essential-ly,\" Hattler says. Hattler began working on the IMO in a Denver-area machine shop in 1984. \"It was asort of backyard-type operation,\" he says. directly applicable to a long-term artificiallung,\" Hattler says. In the meantime, patientswith acute respiratory distress syndrome,pneumonia, and chronic lung disease couldstand to gain, he says. \"We think this device, placed inside humans for five to seven days, can reversemost of the acute processes that cause respi-ratory distress.\" That means up to 300,000 Americans could benefit yearly from the IMO, andmany of the 5,000 annual deaths from acuteasthma could be prevented. Hattler notes: \"Worldwide, the numbers look like they're in MORE INFORMATION: http://www.upmc.edu/mcgowan/artlung/hattler.htmEXTERNAL FITTING PROXIMAL MANIFOLDHOLLOW FIBER DISTAL MANIFOLD PULSATING BALLOON HOLLOW MEMBRANES (HFM)PNEUMATIC DELIVERY SHAFT FROM PROXIMAL OUT O2 IN Heinvolved when a person is asked to tap her fingers. But Thulborn is interested in farmore complex studies: namely, how a per-son's ability to process language is affectedafter a stroke. \"They're not just losing a part of their brain,\" he says of stroke victims unable tocommunicate. \"They're losing a part of theirhumanity.\" Researchers have hypothesized that after a stroke, the brain tries to redistribute func-tions over existing networks, much like acomputer network would have to rerouteinformation if part of its wiring becamedamaged. By looking at stroke patientsthrough functional MRI and trackinganatomical, physiological, and functionalchanges in brain activity from five hours tosix months after an insult, Thulborn was ableto confirm this theory. He also showed thatredistribution could in fact happen veryquickly and in patients of all ages. It was pre-viously thought that adult brains were too setin stone for such changes to take place. When redistribution occurs, Thulborn also sees some recovery. But why some peopledon't recover still isn't clear to him, though hesurmises (and intends to prove) that extensiveinvolvement of white matter tracts\u2014the net-work cables, let's say\u2014prevents redistribution. Thulborn is working with Marcel Just and Pat Carpenter of Carnegie Mellon University'spsychology department; he believes their effortswill allow doctors to come up with stroke inter-ventions that enhance the redistributionprocess. The research has helped at least onepatient so far. An aphasia-afflicted man wroteThulborn to say the findings made it easier tounderstand what was happening to him.Thulborn's response? Smile. Keep working. IWhat makes Keith Thulborn havelunch at 4 p.m., work until he falls asleep, and startworking again when he wakes up, isthe idea that if he works hard enough,long enough, he is eventually goingto see over the horizon. \"It's the idea that I'm looking at what nobody else has seen,\"Thulborn says. \"That's an incrediblystimulating process. If you think ofadding information to our civiliza-tion's body of knowledge, it's onlywhen you look over the horizon thatyou're actually doing it.\" Thulborn, an MD, PhD (neuro- radiologist and biochemist), is one ofthe world's leading magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) brain researchers. He's Australian, easygoing, clearly dedicated, and fascinated with the mys-tery of the brain. He has certainly seen over afew horizons since coming to Pitt in 1993. To understand how the brain functions, it's a real advantage to see living tissue inaction during cognition. Functional MRI isone of the few ways to do such a thing.Thulborn came to Pitt because it allowedhim to build a functional MRI scanner thatwent beyond 1.5 tesla, all the way to 3.0tesla, and allows researchers to see any partof a functioning brain as if it were in theirbare hands. What he has found is astonishing. Thulborn recently published a paper (Stroke , April 1999) that could one day change theway physicians treat acute stroke patients. Atits simplest, Thulborn can use the souped upscanner to examine what part of the brain isWHAT HE SEES THULBORN SHOWS HOW BRAINS CAN REDISTRIBUTE WORKLOAD AFTER APHASIA.BY MICHAEL ROSENWALD IF YOU COULD SEE A P R I L 11ABOVE: Activation maps of right-handed, left-middle-cerebral-artery stroke patient.

As one faculty member recent-ly noted, most great surgeons were feared. J. R. Watsonwas loved. With the deaths this winter of J. R. Watson, his son Charles Gray Watson, and nephew Thomas M. Watson(MD '76), the Pitt medical community suffered a blowdescribed by one senior University official as nothingless than the loss of the medical school's soul. Ask any-one who attended the memorial service for Charles andJ. R. at Heinz Chapel in late January. Every seat wasfilled; friends and colleagues stood three across in theaisles, packed into the lobby, halls, and stairs outside.The word heard over and over again was \"gentlemen.\" To know the Watsons was to see no coincidence that the words \"gentle,\" \"gentlemen,\" and \"genteel\" allcome from the Latin gentilis, \"belonging to the same clan.\" They belonged to a clan that, at any point in thepast 100 years, has been represented in the PittsburghDR.

You could set your watch by his entrance, which came precisely at 7:45 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. In 15 minutes, at 8 a.m., the first surgery of the daywould begin. Watson would enter his operating room, No. 54, and ask the staff ifthey were ready. They would answer \"yes.\" There was no other acceptable answer.I14P I T T M E Dcommunity of surgeons with the Watson sur-name. The Watsondynasty began with J. R.'sfather, Charles MasenaWatson, who graduatedfrom the University ofPittsburgh School ofMedicine in 1900, and was further perpetuated by his brother William G., his nephewThomas M., as well as Charles Gray. J. R. Watson himself was considered a giant in general surgery. He made nationalheadlines after he performed the first auto-transfusion on record to a boy who had beenstabbed in the heart and left lung. When heretired in 1973, he was credited for helpingbuild the surgical program at Pitt during the1950s and 1960s. These days when most people think of \"Dr. Watson\" they think of Charles GrayWatson. On his endocrine surgery service,Charles Watson's imperative was not unlikehis father's: get to know the patient. And likehis father, he stressed precision of thought,action, and purpose. J. R.

Being cen-tral to voice integrity, damage to the laryn-geal nerve can lead to permanent hoarseness.To do your job right, you had to think aboutthe patient's quality of life after the surgery. Asmall crowd of residents follows Charles Watson as he makes his rounds. It is 6:30 p.m., Election Day, some time during the late 1970s. Amongthe group is David Steed, then a senior resi-dent, today a professor of surgery at theSchool of Medicine. \"Did all of you vote today?\" Watson asked in the formal, aristocratic New England tonein which he spoke. \"No, Dr. Watson. We're too busy,\" said one harried resident. The others concurred.Charles Watson treated words as surgi-cal instruments, his vocabulary a trayof refined tools, exact and literal in use. When he asked questions of his studentshe was Socratic, requiring only that the personanswering be honest. If you know the answeror think you know it, say it. If you don't know,say you don't know. You see, if you bluffedand were wrong, he would never correct you.He would simply move on. But he alwaysremembered who didn't know and wouldexpect them to know the next day. What nerves are critical to protect during a thyroid or parathyroid? To get an answer, Charles Watson would begin with the newest medical students andgo up the line, all the way to the chief resi-dent, if necessary. You worked hard to knowthe answer to questions he was likely to ask,even if it meant a sleepless night poringthrough books. You simply couldn't bear not If you bluffed and were wrong, he would never correct you. He would simply move on. But he alwaysremembered who didn't know and would expect themto know the next day. J. R. WatsonWatson well remembered the dues of getting through such a program. During his own residency, back when he rode abicycle to the Peter Bent Brigham Hospitalin Boston, he once was so exhausted, heactually fell asleep along the way. Right inthe midst of Boston's hair-raising traffic hetoppled over. Fortunately, he landed on thesidewalk. \"I'll finish rounds,\" Watson said. \"All of you who haven't voted, go out and makesure you do.\" For his trademark sensibility, Charles Watson was recognized with threeGolden Apple awards, a Chancellor'sDistinguished Teaching Award, and theHealthcare Foundation of New Jersey'sHumanism in Medicine Award. His former students claim they are good doctors because he was a great one, andthat affinity was returned generously.Richard Simmons, his former departmentchair, made this observation: CharlesWatson always considered the upcoming A P R I L 15ABOVE: It seems an understate- ment to say Charles Watson was a favorite professor.

J. R. and Charles Watson practiced together for a while in the late 1960sand early '70s. Like most surgeons, they brought their own preferences to the operating arena. For instance, their styles ofsuture tying differed: J. R. was a chromicman, Charles a silk man. This was certainlya reflection of the generation in which theytrained; yet, Charles was a silk man in dressas well. If you knew Chuck Watson, youcould hardly imagine him without a jazzybow tie, probably custom-made at a com-pany in Vermont. Those ties were his sarto-rial signature\u2014a detail everyone noticed.What people might not have noticed waswhy he wore them. Nancy Watson tells howCharles started procuring bow ties after herealized his other ties would droop in thefaces of his patients during examinations.He couldn't stand the idea of that. Heshould be putting people at ease, offeringthem the best diagnosis, even a bit of con-solation and perspective; he did not want tocontribute to their discomfort. Even in dress, Chuck Watson's priority was the patient. Iclass to be the brightest, the next residentgroup the most promising. The grass wasalways greener where Chuck Watson stood. The salt seemed stuck in the words asthey hung, floating in the air abovetheOdyssey, Charles and Nancy Watson's 44-foot yawl. Sailing in the Bay ofMaine a couple of summers ago, Charles hadjust been asked by a friend, Robert Flory,what he hoped to accomplish in his last fewyears at the School of Medicine. CharlesWatson said he wanted to raise $5 million toendow surgical research fellowships for resi-dents at Pitt. Nancy knew Charles was pas-sionate about the fluctuations of researchfunding, but still, she thought to herself:\"Good grief, listen to this.\" It was one of those things that could hap- pen during August, which Charles andNancy always spent sailing. The peaceful butsometimes challenging atmosphere often ledto inspired thoughts and exchanges on theboat. Twenty-four hours after Watson madehis wish known out loud, Flory organized acommittee that doubled the endowment'sgoal. The group already is halfway to realiz-ing a $10 million fellowship fund.

They are restless. They shift back and forth, some bumping their kneesrhythmically against the wall in front of them. \"Do you think we can take notes?\" one student asks over her shoulder in a loud whisper. \"I don't know,\" another says softly, \"but this is fun.\" \"Are we supposed to start?\" someone yells. \"No, you have to wait for the whistle,\" Erica Hickey shouts back. Hickey is the curriculum specialist sitting cross-legged in a chair, whistle in onehand, stopwatch in the other. These students are waiting to begin an exam that marks the end of the first Community/Ambulatory Medicine Clerkship (CAMC), a 12-week programthat is a of Pitt's new third-year curriculum. ACONTACTTHE NEW THIRD-YEAR CURRICULUM HAS STUDENTS ASKING LOTS OF GOOD QUESTIONS.BY REBECCA SKLOOT FIRST They have completed a three-week rota- tion in internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics as well as a rotation in a \"selec-tive\" (any of the above of their choosing).Through CAMC, they worked in clinicalsettings ranging from urban hospitals tosmall rural family practices and vans servic-ing low-income urban areas. They have beenobserved and coached every step of the wayby their clinical preceptors but are gatheredtoday for the final evaluation: a perform-ance-based exam and a 100-question writtenexam. Anything they've learned, in any spe-cialty, is fair game. A shrill whistle echoes down the hall and Hickey winces, quickly apologizing for thenoise. But no one moves. \"You're supposed to go into the rooms when the whistle blows!\" yells Hickey, whoseslight frame and subdued demeanor are asharp contrast to her ear-splitting noises. \"Yougo in when it blows once, then you have 10minutes. When I blow it twice you come outand switch stations.\" With that, Hickey wedges the whistle between her lips, covers her ears, and lets outanother strident screech. Several doors creakas students enter their classroom-turned-exam-room-for-the-day to greet their simulat-ed patient and a faculty observer. With the hall barren of students, Mary Hohenhaus peeks her head out of a station toreread her patient's history. Her patient(which is actually a plastic model of a pelvis)is a 35-year-old woman who is experiencing asense of \"heaviness in her pelvis when she liftsthings.\" The note tells Hohenhaus to per-form a pelvic examination and reminds her tospeak to the model as though it were a realpatient. Hohenhaus nods and walks back intothe room where Ilene Burns, assistant profes-sor of family medicine and clinical epidemiol-ogy, stands ready to observe her and answerany questions she might ask the pelvis.Questions like, Does it hurt when I squeeze here?or, Do you and your sexual partners use condoms? When Hohenhaus finishes the physical, Burns will give her feedback until the nextwhistle blows. If Hohenhaus, say, forgets partof the physical exam, or doesn't ask the rightquestions, Burns will tell her, and they'll dis-cuss ways to avoid these mishaps in thefuture. By now, Hohenhaus is accustomed toone-on-one work with faculty\u2014for the past12 weeks, she and other third-year studentshave been working closely with CAMCphysician preceptors, learning to approachand examine patients. 18P I T T M E D Mary Hohenhaus with Gordon Handelsman, MD '83, one of her clerkship preceptors Note: Patients' names and identifying details have been changed.A P R I L 19During the 1960s, before the phrase primary care physician came into vogue, there were physicians of first contact . And according to Steven Kanter, senior associate dean, CAMC was designed with thatphrase in mind. \"I like it because it describes what we are really trying to do with outpatient medicaleducation,\" says Kanter. \"We want students tolearn what happens the very first time a physi-cian sees a patient. Because once the patienthas been seen, some thinking has been done,and you can read that in the chart. But with-out a chart, there are different reasoningprocesses and issues.\" Say, for example, you're a physician doing a routine exam on a patient and the patient'shusband, who's just along for the ride, fallsunconscious in your waiting room. You don'tknow whether he has been poisoned, had astroke or a heart attack, or is suffering fromany number of other possible conditions.What you do know is that you need to help. This situation is worlds different from see- ing the man in an exam room the next day,after paramedics resuscitated him and emer-gency physicians determined that it was a car-diac problem. \"The thinking that goes into that initial assessment of a problem,\" says Kanter, \"iswhat we want students to see in CAMC.\" Afew winding miles beyond the Homestead cemetery where victims from the 1892 steel strike are buried, just two days before her CAMC exam,Hohenhaus sat in a small white exam roomwith nurses rushing past outside the door. Sherested her elbows on her knees, and slowlyrolled her stool toward Jason, an 8-year-oldboy, who hung his head and turned his back toher. She was trying to break the ice. \"So how's school?\" Hohenhaus asked as Jason grabbed the sides of the exam tableand jerked with all his strength. The tabledidn't budge. \"Okay. Fine, I guess,\" he mumbled, yank- ing the tucked-away metal stirrups frombeneath the table. \"Do you have I live?\" \"With him and my grandma,\" Jason sighed, pointing over his shoulder to the man, whowas probably in his 50s, sitting by the door. \"And how is that?\"\"Can we just get this over with?\"\"Get what over with? The exam? Are you worried about the exam?\" \"I'm not worried, I just want to get it over with,\" he snapped, his back still facingHohenhaus, his arms now wrapped tightlyaround his chest. \"Alrighty,\" she said, hopping up from her stool. \"Then you've got to climb up here onthe table.\" Jason twirled around and jumped on the table. Hohenhaus looked at him and said sheneeded to check his tickle reflex. She wiggleda finger against his pudgy side, but Jason resis-ted. She did it again. Hohenhaus leaned in tosee his eyes, which were squeezed shut to stiflehis laughter. \"Gotcha,\" she whispered as he let out a low, anxious giggle. As Hohenhaus circled the table asking Jason to make a muscle for her, puff out hischeeks, take a deep breath, and squeeze herfinger as hard as he could, she asked hisgrandfather, Dave, if he had noticed anyproblems at home. He hadn't. At school?Nope, none. They just need to get the formsfilled out. But Hohenhaus wasn't convinced.She turned to Jason. \"Yeah. Fine, I guess.\"Something didn't feel right, but Hohenhaus dropped the issue. Across the hall from the exam room, Gordon Handelsman (MD '83), Hohenhaus'spreceptor, sat at his desk waiting. This waspart of their regular routine: Hohenhauswould take the patient's history, carry out acomplete physical, decide what she wanted todo for the patient, then report it all toHandelsman. He would then question hermethods and decisions, carry out his owninterview and physical exam with her standingnext to him, then they would meet again todiscuss everything she had or hadn't done. \"Well?\" Handelsman said, leaning back in his chair. Mary was one of the best studentshe'd ever had; he was eager to hear her takeon the situation. \"It's so nice when there's nothing wrong with them,\" Hohenhaus sighed as she col-lapsed into a chair. So far that day she hadseen patients with problems ranging from kid-ney failure to excessive overmedication, andJason was the first who seemed healthy. \"Jason is an 8-year-old male here today with his grandfather. . .\" \"Wait. Isn't that his father?\"\"No, I think it's his grandfather.\"\"Where are his parents?\"\"I'm not sure.\"\"So he lives with his grandparents?\"\"Yes.\" \"Why?\" \"I'm not sure. The grandfather didn't say.\"\"How's he school?\" \"The grandfather says he's doing fine.\"\"At home?\" \"Same.\"You don't know whether he has been poisoned, had a stroke or a heart attack, or is suffering from any number of other possible conditions. What you doknow is that you need to help. \"Is he having any social problems?\" Handelsman didn't wait for an answer. He jumped up from his desk, ran across the hall,and burst into the exam room withHohenhaus close behind. Handelsman knew the man. Dave was a long-time patient. He also knew about Dave'sgrown children, but he had never seen or heardof young Jason before. Something wasn't right. \"Can you clarify your relationship to this child, Dave?\" Handelsman asked with an airof playful confusion. \"I'm his grandfather,\" Dave replied, amused. \"Where are his parents?\" \"Nearby.\"\"How did he end up living with you?\" \"He used to come over to the house so I could help him with his homework. One day,he said he didn't want to live at home any-more and wanted to move in with us.\" Hohenhaus leaned against the wall, watch- ing intently as her preceptor moved aroundthe table tousling Jason's hair and poking hisbelly button. Jason giggled. \"When?\" asked Handelsman as he looked in Jason's ear. ago,\" Dave replied.\"How's he handling fine.\"\"Talk to you about it much?\" asked Handelsman, moving to the other ear. \"Nope.\"Jason sat still, playing with a balled up T- shirt in his lap. \"Drugs? Alcohol?\" Handelsman asked put- 20P I T know.\"Handelsman looked into Hohenhaus's eyes and nodded. Physicians of first contact can't afford tobe shy with their questions. And thesituation with Jason was a perfect example. As the primary physician, it wasessential that Handelsman learn more aboutJason. His possible exposure to drugs andalcohol in utero, and the details of his family life, could shed light on learning, behavioral,or even physical problems that might mani-fest in the future. \"Part of being a medical student,\" says Handelsman, \"is not just medical training, it'ssocial training.\" \"There was something about the situation that just didn't seem right,\" Hohenhaus says. \"The grandfather was so matter-of-fact about the whole thing, but I knew I wasmissing something. The thing I learned fromthat experience was that when a situationmakes you scratch your head, you haven'tasked the right questions. And you have tobe able to ask the right questions, or youwon't get the information that determineshow you care for your patients.\" In her clerkship, Hohenhaus learned she needs to go into a patient's drug history, sex-ual history, what's going on in the home life.She needs to ask the questions that mightmake a patient uncomfortable. She learned that questions are part of the larger art of patient examination, and she'llnever forget it. This lesson, which seems like abasic requirement for any med student, isn'tone that has been taught across the board.Kanter takes this issue to heart. \"We want every single person who gradu- ates from the University of Pittsburgh Schoolof Medicine to know how to do a good histo-ry and physical,\" says Kanter. To master the artof the physical exam, students must practice.But in order to practice, they must go wherethere are patients. \"WhenIwasi nmed school,\" says Handelsman, \"I did nooutpatient work at all. Zilch. Everything I did was inpatient.\" But medicine was different then\u2014 patients were admitted for procedures thatnow involve only a few hours of hospitaltime. So if students are going to see thescope of modern medicine, they need to doit in outpatient clinics. Through the past fewyears, outpatient experience started poppingup in different areas of medical education\u2014 students got a bit of outpatient in pediatrics, a few weeks in family medicine, but it wasnever coordinated overall. And according toKanter, this was a limitation. The school'scurriculum committee decided to take themajority of the outpatient experienceincluded in the curriculum and put it intoone clerkship. \"What we have now,\" says Kanter, \"are representatives from various disciplines work-ing together to figure out the best way toteach primary care as an integrated concept toour students.\" And the innovation hasn't goneunnoticed: Pitt was awarded a grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA) as a national demonstration site foran integrated clerkship in primary care. Students are noticing the change too.\"When a situation makes you scratch your head, you haven't asked the right questions. And you have to beable to ask the right questions.\" Third year student Ryan Levy and William Markle, MD, his instructor for the day'sdidactic session A P R I L 21\"It used to be that you got your outpatient experience in dribs and drabs,\" saysHohenhaus. \"Now, eventhough you're doing someinternal familypractice, and some pediatrics,it's all primary care outpatientmedicine, so it focuses the pro-gram and drives home During her Hohenhaus in three months.\"You never know what's goingto be behind each exam door.You just walk into a room andthink fast on your feet. It hasput me in a great position forthe rest of my third year. I canwalk through any door intoany room and not be throwntoo much by what I find.\" Even if what she finds is a plastic pelvis and a facultymember who's waiting to eval-uate her. Hickey, still sitting cross-legged inScaife Hall, squeezes her eyes shutone more time and lets out a final double-whistle. Hohenhaus and the otherstudents slowly pour out of their last station.They're exhausted. They have 20 minutes torecover before their written exam, while theother half of the class, who has just spent themorning answering the 100 written ques-tions, gets ready for its performance-basedtest. As the students wander down the hallen routeto the cafeteria, the faculty gathers in the hall to compare notes. Basil Zitelli and William Markle approach each other smiling. Zitelli, a professor of pedi-atrics and the clerkship director, and Markle,an assistant professor of family medicine whoorganized the performance-based exam, havebeen pacing the halls nervously for the lasthour, going from the written exam to the per-formance-based stations and back again,making sure everything is running smoothly.They are pleased. Other than a little confusion over whistles, the exam was a smash success. The students could think of only one way to describe it: \"Fun.\" But beyond having a little fun, moreimportantly, they got to demonstrate allthey'd learned during CAMC while findingplaces for future improvement. For Hohenhaus, this meant impressing fac- ulty with her ability to ask the right questions.But the students did have one suggestion forthe organizers of CAMC: They wanted moreperformance-based exams, and they wantedthem scattered throughout the clerkship, notjust at the end. Because, like the rest of CAMC, the exams presented them with a one- on-one learning opportunity like they'd neverexperienced before. They wanted more.

BY SALLY ANN FLECKER ost-DepressioneraCleveland: Two boys, cousins, one the elder by 10 years or so, are thrown together by the vicissitudes of fortune and familial generosity. The parents of the older boy must worklong hours to keep their dry goods business afloat. The parents of the younger child\u2014better situated financially\u2014are happy to play host, toinvite the cousin, a budding young scientist, to spend time after school, toenjoy dinners and evenings in their home. It's a sweet scene, one thatNorman Rockwell could have painted: the small boy sitting in wide-eyed aweof his older cousin, breathing in the excitement of science, of its wondrouspower to untangle so many mysteries, to describe and illuminate what cannot be seen. Art Levine was that young child in Cleveland, and he never forgot what he took in at his cousin's knee. As it turned out, the older cousin,Donald Glaser, lived up to his earlypromise. He became a physicist andinvented a device called the bubblechamber that revolutionized scientists'ability to visualize the invisible\u2014subatomic particles. In 1960, whenGlaser was only 34, he was awarded theNobel prize in physics. So perhaps ArtLevine's earliest wise decision was inchoosing his first mentor. P H O T O G R A P H Y |R O Y E N G E L B R E C H TPISTRUE Pitt has chosen a leader who was at the heart ofthe world's premier medical research centerfor 31 years.

H I S A I M A P R I L 23Present day Pittsburgh: There is a carved Javanese spear on the wall behind the desk where Art Levine carries out his duties as dean of the University of PittsburghSchool of Medicine and senior vice chancellorfor the health sciences. It's a beautiful piece, sointricately carved, so carefully hung as if caughtin mid-thrust, it seems almost a gentle artifact.\"My daughter gave me that when I took thisjob,\" says Levine. \"She's a lawyer.\" He laughs.It's the laughter of a man who has no doubtsabout his ability to use a spear if need be. Levineis a straight-to-the-point kind of guy. He has tobe. He has taken on a hugejob\u2014responsible for the direction, not to mention the vision, of thesix schools of the health sciences. He has to beon top of how economics and politics arethreatening the very premise of the academichealth center in this country so he can lead andstrategize in ways that will lessen this threat.And, he's in the process of re-establishing hisNational Institutes of Health lab and setting itup in Pittsburgh where he can continue to over-see research on the molecular mechanisms ofDNA repair and mutagenesis, the processes thatgovern the fidelity of our genomes and underliemuch disease and disorder. Already Levine is something of a larger- than-life figure on campus. Legend has it thathe met with every member of the health sci-ences faculty upon his arrival here. Not possi-ble, Levine laughs: \"I couldn't have done that; we have nearly 5,000 members.\" But like alllegends, this one has a toe-hold in reality.the necessary tools\u2014including board certifica-tion in pediatrics and oncology and a post doc- toral position with the National Cancer Institute(which he joined as a United States Public HealthService Officer to fulfill his mili tary obligation\u2014 then rose to the rank of admiral). \"Physician-scientists have a unique contribu- tion to make; they are trained to appreciate howresearch that seems very remote from thehuman condition eventually doesredound to the benefit of their patients,\" he points out. Infact he's concerned with the country's currentdearth of young physician-scientists and is start-ing a program at Pitt to encourage promisingdoctors to pursue careers in academic medicineand biomedical research. Indeed, members of the health sciences fac- ulty seem to be confident that Levine brings allthe right tools: an understanding of clinicalmedicine, clinical investigation, basic investiga-tion, and leadership. \"The medical school isnow lifting off more rapidly,\" says Zeidel. \"Dr.Detre made it possible for the school to gofrom the middle of the pack to the top 10. Andnow we can see our way, with Dr. Levine at thehelm, of getting into the top five.\" The medical school now sits among the 10 highest-ranked schools with respect to NIHresearch grants. Levine's goal is to site the otherPitt health science schools similarly. Within hisfirst year as head, he established the ground-breaking Center for Pharmacogenetics in theSchool of Pharmacy, one of the first in thenation. Two projects near and dear to his heart\u2014While making the transition to Pitt from hispost as scientific director of the NationalInstitute of Child Health and HumanDevelopment, Levine read\u2014and committedto and bibliographies ofevery tenured tenure-stream professor inPitt's health science schools. That's 530, forthose of you keeping score. Mark Zeidel, chair of the medical school's Department of Medicine, tellsabout Levine's first interview at Pitt.Meeting over lunch with the medicalschool's 23 department chairs, Levine pro-ceeded to wow the group by going aroundthe room and thoroughly describing theresearch of each individual; he had read indetail the research papers of each chair. \"It was impressive,\" says Zeidel. \"It told us several things. One, that he was serious aboutthe job and came prepared. Second, that heunderstood how to touch the heartstrings ofacademics\u2014talk to them about their work.And third, that he was able to follow andunderstand what people's work was and whatits significance was, so that he could makedecisions about what kinds of work he want-ed to support and put resources into, andwhat he wouldn't be as interested in puttingresources into.\" In fact, Levine is particularly poised to strike a balance. Early on in medical school, heunderstood that he would make his way pro-fessionally as a physician anda researcher, and he set about the long, slow process of gathering 2 4P I T T M E D\"We need to get all of the schools positioned so they can exploit as fully as possible the fruits of the human genome project,\" says Levine.BRADLEY BARNES AERIAL the development of a center for human genetics and integrative biology and the creation of a veryhigh field MRI facility\u2014he says will keep Pitton the leading edge in research and treatment. At the medical school, Levine is pushing for an increase in endowed, merit-based as well asneed-based scholarships to help relieve theheavy financial burden on medical students.He has high praise for the school's curriculum,which he calls one of the country's most inno-vative. Yet, he reminds, \"Education has a fluid-ity that we have to respect and cherish\u2014whichmeans that we have to constantly refine thecurriculum as we refine our understanding ofwhat the core of a medical education should beat any point in time.\" Faculty observers say they like the fact that Levine gets up and talks about the importanceof research. And they appreciate the value hehas put on good teaching as well as the highestquality of patient care. \"And he's very straight,\" notes Zeidel. \"You ask him a question, you get an answer. And it'sextremely well stated and right to the point.\" Levine is a man who likes nothing morethan to feel that he has got his arms wide around a challenge. The son of a lawyer and teacher, his personality bears thestamp of both of their influences. \"My mother was a very atypical Jewish mother in that she seemed to have little inter-est in my going to medical school,\" Levine sayswith a fond smile. \"I think she would havemuch preferred that I become a poet.\" The possibility was not out of the ques- tion. Although science was an early and pas-sionate interest, Levine majored in Russianliterature at Columbia College in New York.During his junior and senior years, he waseditor of the Columbia Review . Levine laughs when he admits that he fulfilled his sciencerequirement with a course in spherical astron-omy\u2014largely because it was offered jointlywith the women's college, Barnard.The nudge that led Levine back toward a career in science came from his father. \"Thenight before my college graduation, my fatherreminded me that I would have to make a liv-ing,\" Levine says, his voice carrying the toneof a story he likes to tell on himself. \"In anattempt to stall that as long as I could, I said,'I have a great idea. I'll go to medical school.'\"(Levine notes that medical students have thelongest period of dependency on their parentsof any mammalian species.) For two years, while he caught up on the required pre-med courses, Levine threw himselfinto life in New York with the wide-rangingenthusiasms and intense energy already atrademark of his tenure at Pitt. He workedbehind the scenes in off-Broadway theater,continued to study Russian lit, translatedRussian scientific literature for a technicalpublishing house. Oh, and lest we forget, hedrove race cars.

He was driving a Porsche\u2014withvery low slung doors. \"When they handed methe checkered flag,\" he says, \"I leaned over toget it and fell out of the car.\" Onward to medical school in Chicago where he intended to specialize in psychiatryand then psychoanalysis. \"That seemed to meto allow the sciences and the arts to meethalfway,\" he says. But a funny thing happenedon the way to his second year. \"Watson andCrick described the structure of DNA,\" he says. \"And I was hooked\u2014both on its scientific implications and its aesthetics.\" There's another telltale piece of \"art\"hung on the wall in Levine's office.While the Javanese spear hangs behind his chair, where visitors can appreciate it,another simply framed image is placed so thatwhen Levine looks up from his work his eyesfall upon it. This unassuming piece representswhat he proudly calls his earliest significantachievement in biomedical research\u2014thefirst genetic map of SV40, a mammaliantumor-causing virus that has long been aclassic biological model. Levine's long career at the National Institutes of Health\u20141967 to 1998\u2014meansthat Pitt has chosen as a leader a man who hasbeen at the heart of the world's premier centerof medical research. Despite times of fiscalhardship, as the National Institute of ChildHealth and Human Development's scientificdirector, Levine built one of the most fruitfulscientific programs found anywhere. MichaelGottesman, deputy director for intramuralresearch at NIH, underscores the wisdom andenormous breadth of scientific knowledgethat Levine brings to Pittsburgh: \"We misshim greatly around the table of other scientif-ic directors where he more often than nottook the leadership role.\" Likewise, Levine's early and deep interest in the double helix makes him well equippedto lead the health science schools into the21st century. \"The human genome project,\" Levine says with a touch of mischief, \"is like theManhattan telephone directory. It tells youwhere everybody lives and how to spell theirnames. But it doesn't tell you who's sleepingwith whom. In other words, the next challengein biomedical reasearch is to illuminate theinteractions of gene products.\" Levine has imposed genetics\u2014with its integrated concomitants of molecular, cellu-lar, structural, developmental, and computa-tional biology\u2014as a common theme through-out the health sciences. \"We need to get all ofthe schools positioned so they can exploit asfully as possible the fruits of the humangenome project,\" he says. The complex, even daunting, research that the genome map will provoke provides just thesort of challenge Levine is equipped to tackle.Levine will bring all of his experiences\u2014fromhis early days at the feet of his older cousin, tohis thrill at Watson and Crick's discovery, to hisown elucidation of the genetic structure andfunction of SV40\u2014to bear as he leads Pitt'shealth sciences into this new era. His spear remains secure on the wall. But it appears that Art Levine's aim is as true andaccurate as it gets. IAlready Levine is something of a larger-than-life figure on campus. Legend has it that he met with every memberof the health sciences faculty upon his arrival here. A P R I L 2526 P I T T M E DPitt researchers are able to create new compounds at an extraordi- nary rate using methods of combinatorial chemistry. One process,split synthesis, is conducted so quickly that researchers mustassign tags like this one to compounds to track them as they movethrough the system. Each tag emits a unique radio frequency sig-nal that is read by a scanner.n the ninth floor of the University of Pittsburgh Chevron ScienceCenter, a computer-controlledrobotic arm releases 90 droplets of a sample into a matrix of 90 vials in the sameinstant. Each receiving vial fills with a differentmix of chemical solutions, so that 90 differentreactions take place simultaneously with everyplunge of the arm. In the seconds it takes therobotic arm to make its dipping gesture, 90brand new chemical compounds are created. Ina day, this device alone could invent hundreds,even thousands of compounds. F E A T U R E P H O T O G R A P H Y |A L E X B E L L O T T I O This robotic synthesizer is one of many pieces of equipment housed within three bright blue labs at Pitt's Chevron Science Center that is altering the realm of chemical discovery. Here, new com- pounds undescribed in textbooks and yet unseen by humankind arebeing created. What's truly amazing is the rate and level of sophisti-cation at which this is happening. Consider this: There are maybe 50 million known organic mole- cules for chemists to choose from as they attempt to create new struc-tures. And any 10 of those building blocks could translate to 10 billionnew compounds. The diversity of chemicalstructures is practically unlimited. Now, imagine you are a pharmacologist or chemist or materials scientist. Of themind-numbing number of chemical possi-bilities, you probably have the tools tobuild one compound at a time. And thenonce you have synthesized your new chem-ical structure, you must test it, crossingyour fingers that it might actually lead to anew drug or a new fabric or a new build-ing material. If it doesn't, then it's back tothe drawing board of organic molecules.The rate of discovery is going to be glacial. It's glacial unless, unless, you work in one of the very few universities where a single wave of a robotic arm unveils 90 new chemical possibilities. A university that has taken fulladvantage of advances in robotics and computer technology. Where,in fact, an entire army of high-tech equipment soldiers away at thebusiness of chemistry, materials science, and pharmacology. Therearen't many such universities. Some industries, particularly pharmaceutical companies, began establishing in-house combinatorial chemistry capabilities about sixyears ago. The Combinatorial Chemistry Center (CCC) in theUniversity of Pittsburgh's Department of Chemistry was founded in1997 and marks one of the first such labs in an academic setting.Investigators from scientific disciplines throughout the University arewelcome to use the center, but it has forged particularly promising col-laborations between the School of Medicine and the Department ofChemistry, notes Peter Wipf, a professor of chemistry who also servesDRUG DISCOVERY LIKE NEVER BEFORE BY MUBARAK S.

In terms of drug discovery, the timing is prime for combinatorial work, says John S.Lazo, Allegheny Foundation Professor, chairof the School of Medicine's Department ofPharmacology, and director of the Universityof Pittsburgh Cancer Institute's Fiske DrugDiscovery Laboratory. He notes that withthe completion of the human genome pro-ject on the horizon, he and other investiga-we can create a large number of compoundsthat can be isolated and tested simultaneously.So with the same effort it used to take to buildand test one compound, we're looking at hun-dreds. That's a huge step forward.\" Day uses combinatorial methods tomore rapidly identify what are called \"lead compounds.\" By lead, Day isn't talking about the metal, he's talkingabout compounds that have previouslyunmapped structures or combinations ofchemical building blocks and that alsodemonstrate previously unknown biologicalactivity in cell cultures. Day describes leadcompounds as \"the first sparks of ideas.\" Heand his colleagues are making some sparks oftheir own. They've identified a lead com-pound called discodermalide, which is show-ing early potential in treating breast, prostate,and ovarian cancer. Discodermalide stabilizescells' microtubules, which act as the railwaysfor intracellular deliveries and the ratchetingsystem for pulling apart duplicated chromo-somes. Stabilizing these microtubules caninhibit cancer cell division and lead to apop-tosis (cellular suicide). Day sees combinatorial methods yielding \"more drugs faster and cheaper.\" And Dennis P. Curran, a distinguished ser- vice professor and Bayer professor of chem-istry, adds another layer to the promise offaster, cheaper drugs: better drugs. \"In the past, it took a lot of work to come up with a structure that passed muster as adrug,\" Curran says. \"By the time we got one,we had a pretty good idea of what the drugshould look like, but the process of refiningthe chemical structure of the drug could betime consuming and costly.\" But with combinatorial technology, not only can you discover new lead compoundsmore quickly, but you can create what wereonce prohibitively costly iterations to refine the best possible structure of a new drug. tors are anxious to identify drugs that willinteract with the molecular and biochemicaltargets the genome project defines. Billy Day shares his enthusiasm. Day is an associate professor of environmental and occu-pational health at the Graduate School ofPublic Health; he says, \"The way I was trained20 years ago as a medicinal chemist was tomake one chemical compound at a time. \"But today, with combinatorial chemistry, \"With the same effort it used to take to build and test one compound, we're looking at hundreds. That's ahuge step forward.\" John Lazo (left) and Peter Wipf at the Chevron Science Center \"You can easily make 1,000 variations on a basic drug design. Each of the 1,000 copies is similar, but slightly different,\" Curranpoints out. Testing will then yield which ofthe slightly modified structures is the bestchoice as a drug. \"So we've moved from total trial and error to educated trial and error,\" he says with achuckle. As Wipf and his colleagues synthesizenew chemical possibilities, they still may not know exactly what offspring are going to result from the myriad of repeat-ed reactions that go on in robot-dipped testtubes, reaction box flasks, or other suchdevices. So once a new generation of com-pounds has been created, it must be tested forits structure. The CCC buzzes with instrumentation for analyzing, purifying, and controlling thequality of the compounds it creates\u2014andpretty much all of this instrumentation is dri-ven by a generous store of gigabytes. Withcompounds being generated at this exponen-tial rate, combinatorial work relies heavily onthe latest in software informatics to keepstraight the hundred or so chemical innova-tions it generates on a daily basis. These extraordinary machines tend to look innocuous. One vaguely resembles a checkout counter at a grocery store, but instead oftwo-for-one specials, it offers split synthesistagging. At this station, a computer usesradio-frequency tagging to decipher the con-tents of newly created compounds. Thecompounds move through the system in theform of bead-like samples ranging in sizefrom as small as your fingernail to as big asyour thumb. The scanner reads radio-fre-quency chips embedded in capsules placedin each compound. Then the system tellsthe operator the basic chemical buildingblocks contained in each bead and evenwhat beads to mix together to synthesizemore complex compounds. Wipf and his students might, for example, use the split synthesis station to create and taga series of \"small organic molecules\" (asopposed to large proteins or pieces of DNA)for John Lazo. Lazo is likely to take these com-pounds back to his lab to analyze their appli-cations on cellular structures as possible drugs. Lazo conducts these studies using some of the School of Medicine's equally whiz-bangequipment that also utilizes robotic andcomputer technology. His department laysclaim to the only Cellomics Array Scan II ina university lab. Using the Array Scan, he isable to conduct cell-based, multiparameterinterrogation of chemical libraries. In otherwords, Lazo can fluorescently tag a molecu-lar target within a cell, then take a library ofnewly created compounds, or small mole-cules, provided by Wipf, and map how theyinteract with that target. Lazo can do this with 96 compounds at once, examining how they react with up tothree molecular targets at a time. This takeshim all of about 25 minutes. Doing this \"theold way,\" as Lazo likes to put it, would havetaken an ambitious month. Combinatorial technology has given Lazo and his colleagues front row seats to the innerworkings of emerging therapeutics. From thisvantage point, they can examine how variouscompounds affect protein synthesis (which iscritical to cellular regulation), ion movement(which can have implications for conditionssuch as hypertension), apoptosis (a naturalphenomenon, which could provide leads tonovel cancer therapeutics). . . . In effect, with As Wipf and others mix solutions at a speed that makes heads spin, you might wonder,does anything ever, you know, blow up?Actually, combinatorial chemistry has takensome of the bang out of the whiz bang. Ofcourse, Wipf's team takes great care to keepthe labs safe, but the combinatorial processtypically uses smaller quantities of solutionsand less glass (some vials are plastic orteflon), so the work of discovery is actuallyless dangerous. RIGHT: A parallel synthesizer for solid phase synthesis A P R I L 2930 P I T T M E DR E I N I N G I N T H E R O G U E S Sometimes there canbe too much of a good thing. The addition of a high-energy phosphate to particular amino acids is crucial to cel- lular communication in the body. Many diseases, however\u2014including cancer, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, and obesity\u2014are thought, at least in part, to be due to abnormali-ties in the enzymes that facilitate this process. John S. Lazo, chair of the Departmentof Pharmacology, is especially interested in a relatively simple group of proteins thatregulate both these signaling pathways and a cell-cycle checkpoint controlling sys-tem. Certain variants of this checkpoint system have oncogenic properties and areoverexpressed in many cancers such as non-small cell lung, breast, and head and neckcancer as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Lazo and his colleagues have describedthe combinatorial synthesis of a library of small molecules designed as inhibitors ofthe rogue enzymes. And this inhibition could be a crucial first step in the creation of potential anti-can- cer agents. -PP this technology, investigators can learn pretty much anything they would ever want toknow about what a chemical compound doesat a cellular level. For a pharmacologist, trial and error never looked so good. But what of all those newly generatedcompounds that do not seem to holdany therapeutic promise? Has their cre- ation been a waste of time, the proverbialstack of hay hiding the chemical needle forwhich everyone has been searching? Not at all. Even if a compound doesn't turn out to have an obvious use, its discovery stilladvances scientific understanding. Go back to those 50 million organic mol- ecules that constitute the basic buildingblocks of chemistry. Those molecules, and allthe structures that can be built out of theirvarious combinations, can be thought of asmaking up \"chemical space.\" \"But talking about chemical space is a lit- tle like talking about outer space,\" says Lazo. \"We're not really sure what's out there. We can tell you where a lot of chemical planetsand even galaxies are, but there are a lot ofblack holes, too.\" Combinatorial chemistry promises to help fill in many of the black holes. One ofits advantages, says Lazo, is that it will allowthe University to build its own \"library\" ofknown chemicals. This means that theUniversity of Pittsburgh canstock up on tens of thou-sands of the known andnewly identified compoundsand keep copies of them \"on file\" for use by researchers and students.That way, a researcher can go to the centerand request her own personal library of 50or 1,000 chemicals to use in her experi-ments, Lazo says. Wipf and Lazo hope to have 100,000 compounds in the library by fall 2000.They also are collaborating with NIH, gar-nering access to that agency's storehouse ofcompounds. \"Scientists can then withdraw compounds from it like students check out a book fromFalk Library,\" Lazo says. \"You could not havedone this stuff two years ago.\" Combinatorial advances have invited clos- er cooperation between researchers in comple-mentary disciplines. Medical scientists, drugresearchers, biochemists, and chemical engi-neers will be able to share their results withone another, and borrow from each other's successes, through the compound library. As you can imagine, Wipf, Lazo, andcolleagues pursue fruitful partnerships with industry. Yet they see themselves upholding a distinct academic mission. \"We don't want to just duplicate what's already being done in industry,\" says Curran.\"We're not here simply to make copies of com-pounds for industrial use. All of our projectshave to have a clear educational component,and all of our work should be done with theidea of heralding new scientific discovery.\" Or as Lazo might describe it, their mission is to chart the vast and compelling frontier ofchemical space.

His peersthought he was crazy to do it, though they knew hewas a maverick, and several decades into a career built on the fringe. Starzl, University of Pittsburgh distinguishedservice professor of the health sciences and director of theThomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute, had proven himselftime and time again, but this seemed utter lunacy. TA HOPE TO END THE NEED FOR IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS IS GROUNDED IN MORE THAN MYTH. BY REBECCA SKLOOT I L L U S T R A T I O N S |B E C K Y S M I T H I N S E A R C H O F CHIMERAS32 P I T T M E DStarzl's hunch started with something he'd seen in animal models: some only needed enough immunosuppressants to overcome thebody's initial immune reaction, then theorgan mysteriously induced a state called tol-erance\u2014peaceful coexistence of donor andrecipient tissues. To other surgeons, his theory seemed unlikely. After all, everyone knows that afterany successful transplant, a patient's blood,rich with cells programmed to distinguish selffrom non-self, floods into a foreign organ fullof foreign cells. This point, where the recipi-ent's immune system meets its new organ, is amoment of potentially fatal clash. Maturecells from the donor and recipient recognizeeach other as foreign and mount theirimmune attacks. Surgeons keep a handle onthis initial reaction with immunosuppressivedrugs, but there's a natural process of celldeath that must accompany transplantation:All mature immune cells must die. What'sleft, from both donor and recipient, are youngcells, those not yet learned in self versus non- self. As long as their cellular cohabitation ispeaceful, the organ isn't rejected, and thepatient has achieved tolerance. The field oftransplantation is pretty much in agreementon that. What might happen next, however,now is hotly debated. If you're a transplant surgeon, and you're notStarzl, when your patient reaches this ini- tial state of tolerance, chances are you'lllymphomas, and other side effects that cancome with immunosuppressants. According to Starzl and John Fung, an MD, PhD and Pitt professor of surgery, bychemically inhibiting the immune system ofthe recipient, physicians induce a state thatmimics tolerance, but actually prevents true tolerance from developing. True tolerance, ifyou ask them, is a state of perfect natural har-mony. No drugs. And it starts with those twopopulations of young cells that remain afterthe initial immune response. If all goes well,and they're allowed to rebuild an immune sys-tem together, the young cells mature, neverlearning the other is truly foreign, and indoing so, train the body that the transplantedorgan is not foreign. And that, say Fung and Starzl, is true tolerance. So, if you're Starzl, once your patient passed through that initialimmune response, you might take him offmedications to see if his body could take over. Of the 16 patients Starzl took off immunosuppressants on a hunch, 11 startedto reject\u2014he quickly put them back on med-ication. But five made his hunch seem farfrom lunacy: They had no immune reaction.To this day, they're walking around withtransplanted organs and aren't takingimmunosuppressants. According to Starzlthis true tolerance has only one explanation:chimerism. According to the ancient Greeks, acreature once roamed the earth with the body of a lion, tail of a serpent, and head of a goat. They called it a chimera.The beast actually had a number of configu-rations in ancient myth, and the term\"chimera\" lingers today with many mean-ings. If you look up \"chimera\" in the dictio-nary, you'll see that it's more than a mythicalcreature. It's an unrealizable dream, a fabri-cation of the mind, or a person with tissuesexhale a sigh of relief and write a prescriptionregime for immunosuppressants that he'll beon for, oh, the rest of his life. The belief hasbeen that it takes an arsenal of medication tomaintain the necessary peace between thedonor organ and its recipient. Transplantsurgeons have done this for years, and theresulting amity is still called tolerance. But ifyou ask Starzl and his colleagues, this is nottruetolerance. \"We can't go on thinking that immune suppression is the best solution,\" says MassimoTrucco, a professor of pediatrics at Pitt. \"It'sthe worst solution, but right now it's the onlysolution we have.\" It's the worst solutionbecause humans lead active, sometimesdestructive, lives: they get drunk, they get theflu, and they need an immune system that cankeep up. Unfortunately, immunosuppressiondoesn't just inhibit an immune response to theforeign organ, it inhibits allimmune responses, even those necessary to withstand day-to-dayexposures. And for a transplant patient onimmunosuppressants, one case of the flu oranother infection can kick off organ rejection.And that's saying nothing of the kidney failure,According to the ancient Greeks, a creature once roamed the earth with the body of a lion, tail of a serpent, and head of a goat. This cross-section of a rat aortic allograft shows no signs of chronic damage. The animal had received a liver from the same donor and become tolerant. Studies in animals that did not receive same-donor transplants did not exhibit normal aortas.of diverse genetic composition. And with a Starzl-sized step fur-ther, \"chimera\" could mean theend of immunosuppressants and begin-ning of true tolerance. \"By definition,\" says Fung, \"if you get a transplant, you'rechimeric.\" In the transplantworld, a chimera is a patientwith two cell populations, onefrom her own body, one fromthat of an organ donor. But no one besides Starzl thought too much about whatchimerism could mean until aFestschrift in 1990, when he anda colleague were each asked towrite a chapter for a book onheart and lung transplantation.Starzl was to write a chapter onthe mechanisms for whole organacceptance; the other chapter wasto cover tolerance. When Starzl caught wind of this idea he looked at his col-leagues and said, \"Well hell,they're the same thing.\" They alllooked at Starzl, told him he'd losthis mind, for real this time, anddared him to prove it. Starzl went home and began searching for his chimera. Hecalled Trucco, an expert in poly-merase chain reaction, which canbe used to test cellular identitybased on DNA, and Pitt'sAnthony Demetris, whose exper-tise was in identifying cellsthrough HLA antibody testing,which utilizes dyes that fluorescein the presence of certain cellularproteins. And he called 30 of hislongest-term patients. He neededthem for samples, he said, andthey came from around theworld to help. One patient, we'll call her Susan, received an organ from a4-year-old boy when she herselfwas 4. Susan was a wife and A P R I L 33 ABOVE: Systemic chimerism. The stars represent donor cells that migrated throughout the patient's body from a transplanted organ.34 P I T T M E Dmother by the time Starzl called. She and patients like her, those who had transgendertransplants, offered particularly hard-hittingevidence for Starzl. When Starzl, Trucco, and Demetris presented their lab results,complete with images of Susan's cells, therewas nothing much their opponents could say: Susan had Y chromosomes on approxi- mately .1 percent of the cells in her body. Thedonor's cells had actually migrated and remained in her tissue. \"That means,\" says Starzl, \"she's closer, in a physical sense, to that donor than she's beento anyone in her life, with only one excep-tion: when she was a baby in her mother'swomb.\" And in case that wasn't evidenceenough, Starzl offered many other examples. \"I always knew those cells were there, I had just never looked for them myself,\" he says. To Starzl, the lingering of donor cells was a key to understanding how his early animalmodels developed true tolerance. These cells,as Starzl and his colleagues discovered, don'tlive just in the donated organs. They can livepeacefully throughout recipients' bodies: intheir lymph organs, in their skin, and in othersites. And it's not that the donor gives cellsalong with, say, a liver, it's that the donor'scells actually move from that liver, or lung, orany other organ that was transplanted, outinto the surrounding tissues. Once this hap-pens, these patients are chimeric, or moreaccurately, microchimeric. At this point, thehighest level of chimerism anyone has seen ina transplant patient is about what Susanreached\u2014.1 percent. But most importantly,even if only on a micro-level, these patientshave accepted somedonor cells as self. This means, to a degree, that they've accepted thedonor organ as self also. If only this micro-level of acceptance could be increased, saysStarzl, true tolerance could be reached. According to Demetris, it's clear thatStarzl was on to something with his hunch about chimerism: \"Micro- chimerism gives you a form of tolerance;\" hesays, \"it's just not quite robust enoughbecause there are not enough donor cells [ina microchimeric's body].\" So Starzl,Demetris, and Fung are all trying to findways to move from micro to macro. They started by infusing large quantities of donor blood cells, and later infused about2 billion donor bone marrow cells, at thetime of transplantation to increasechimerism. But without fail, patients cameout microchimeric at best. Researchers havetried irradiating the recipients to suppresstheir immune systems and increasechimerism. But in the end, that's no step-up from immunosuppressive drug therapy:\"You can irradiate marrow,\" says Demetris, \"but you paya price for that irradiation down the road.And that's not quite acceptable.\" So,researchers are trying to boost chimerismthrough less morbid procedures. Some Pitt researchers are trying to iden- tify which donor cells remain in recipients'bodies and have tolerance-inducing prop- erties. Once they've succeeded, they hope to grow those cells in culture to be used innew infusion therapy trials. Another groupis developing what they call \"co-stimulato-ry molecule blockers,\" which are designedto thwart the body's immune response,preventing it from killing the cells deemedessential for tolerance. \"Figuring out how to induce tolerance is the Holy Grail in transplantation,\" saysFung. He, Starzl, and a few other Pitt researchers say they found the map to theHoly Grail back in 1991 after theFestschrift, though no one believed themat the time. But that was then. Today,there's essentially no question as towhether chimerism plays a role in toler-ance. Some argue that the role is unclear,that there's no way to know which camefirst, the tolerance or the chimerism. Starzlhears these objections, and has one reply:You have to prove me wrong, then I'llbelieve you. And he'll tell you, so far, noone has even come close. I ABOVE: Microchimerism was detected in a female recipient's lymph node more than 10 years after she received a male kidney. Yellow dot represents Y chromosome. According to Starzl and Fung, by chemically inhibiting the immune system of the recipient, physicians induce a state that mimics tolerance, but actually prevents truetolerance from developing.Carol Congedo, MD '76MATT BULVONYWHEN A PHYSICIAN IS THE \"INTERESTING CASE\" BY JOSIE FISHER incredulously. \"When I was a freshman in medical school, I remember professorAlexander Minno telling us to pray everynight not to become an interesting case.

With no dialysis, they presented in endstage renal failure.\" Of course that's not thecase nowadays. \"The first thing I tell people newly diag- nosed with lupus is that this is a survivableand manageable illness. I tell people to learnto say 'no.' Pacing is the name of the gamewith lupus.\" That had been a hard lesson forCongedo.

As half a dozen toddlers are wheeled by in a buggy, Congedo smiles. She then tells how,after the birth of her second child, she beganexperiencing profound fatigue and arthritis inher hand and jaw. \"Stress,\" her internist toldher. But Congedo could not concur. She hadmanaged stress for 10 years as sole practitionerin her McKeesport, Pennsylvania, otolaryngolo-gy practice.

Within a year, Congedo's symptomscompounded until, at age 41, she found herselfflat on her back. This time the prednisone pre-scription was for her. The diagnosis: systemiclupus erythematosus. Her arthritis and weak-ness were so debilitating she couldn't even drive.Within four months, she closed her practice. A rheumatologist told Congedo that since her lupus hadn't expressed itself in early repro-ductive years, her case was not serious. \"Not serious to whom!\" says Congedo,\"I still very strongly feel the call to heal- ing,\" she says. And so Congedo is activelocally and nationally with the LupusFoundation of America; she wrote two book-lets published by the foundation. \"In the United States,\" she says, \"a patient expects a doctor to provide medicine to get acure.

IAND THEY COME TO LEARN PITT'S MINI-MEDICAL SCHOOL BY JENNIFER ANDREWS A T T E N D I N G The night has been difficult. Heavy winds and rain whip at cars, pullat umbrellas, and open jackets to the cold. There will be snow tonight, dead-locks and slow rides home. Despite all this,they still come. Wrapped in layers, the classrumbles in. The Brendlingers, a retired cou-ple, stop at registration, shake out the rain,and grab an information packet. Tonight theywill learn about the brain\u2014how it developsand how it functions with changes they callParkinson's or Alzheimer's. Seconds later,Cindy Ciocca, a registered nurse, pushes through the door. She is still thinking of the son at football practice, her daughter's home-work, and the Halloween costume she has yetto make. But within minutes, she relaxes andremembers why she's here. Like the 500 oth-ers who attend the University of PittsburghSchool of Medicine's Mini-Medical School, she has come to get answers to difficult ques-tions, to hear talk of innovation, therapies,hope. Like her classmates, who are caretakersand college students, professors and retiredprofessionals, she has come to learn. Ciocca finds her way to the middle front of the auditorium and settles in.\"You have to get here early for the best seats or fight your way over legs to get a goodone,\" she says. Though only in its first year, the response to the mini-med school has been overwhelm-ing. Originally designed for 300 students, thisfree, two-and-a half month program, paid forin large part by Pfizer Inc., offers communitymembers the opportunity to find out what'shappening today in medicine. Because enroll-ment was so staggering, organizers, andMaggie McDonald, \"associate for 200 more. Even still, the waiting listcontinues to grow. Over the course of seven seminars, partic- ipants learn about the human infrastructure,the heart, the immune system, the brain,human genetics, and infectious diseases suchas AIDS. Students are shown how science istranslated into new techniques and appliedto clinical medicine\u2014grounded in ways gen-eral audiences will understand. Tonight, twobrains are projected onto a screen; one ishealthy, the other, damaged. Both have beeninjected with an infrared substance thatlights up the brain in places where there isactivity. The healthy brainlights up like a Christmastree, while the other, affectedby Parkinson's, is dark. Theaudience gasps, then goessilent. Ciocca scribbles quietly in her notebook. Others bendover theirs. These students are learning thatmany of the people who were thought tohave Alzheimer's are instead experiencingsomething that, in some respects, is similarto what happens in Parkinson's patients.They are learning that nerve cells die in bothdiseases, and when they do, the cells containPATRICIA NAGLE/CIDDE A P R I L 37'40sFRANK E.

Thesekids, standing in lines, some screaming, otherscrying, were the control group in a study thatled to the polio vaccine. He would go on to finish a residency in medicine and a fellowship in hematology,both at Ohio State University. Over the years,he has distinguished himself by contributingsomething like 350 articles and abstracts onleukemia, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease.Coltman also served as president of theAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology and adirector of the National American CancerSociety. Pitt's School of Medicine recognizedhim with the Hench Award in 1990; he also isa recipient of the Association of CancerCenters' Outstanding Achievement in ClinicalResearch and the US Air Force's Harold Brown Award for significant contributions inchemotherapy research and development. And he still finds time to sleep. IIt's the early 1950s and Charles Coltman Jr.,a student at the University of PittsburghSchool of Medicine, can't sleep at night. The cries of his infant son keep him up, andevery time his wife, Eleanore, tries to put theboy into his crib, the cries start anew. So Coltman, MD '56, consulted his fresh- man seminar professor\u2014the pediatrician withthe odd name, Dr. Benjamin Spock. After hearing about the crying boy, Spock said he could fix the problem: You go home,Coltman recalls him saying, put him to bedand let him cry. Don't go near him. The firstnight, he'll cry for 45 minutes. Don't go nearhim. The second night, he'll cry 20 minutes.The third night, 10. The fourth night, hewon't cry at all. One problem: Coltman and his son were men among women, living in Coltman's boy-hood home with his mother, three sisters, andhis maternal grandmother. \"Well, I went home and announced this strategy to a roomful of women and they said,'It's never going to happen ,'\" says Coltman. \"I had to stand at the top of the stairs and blockthe women from consoling my son, Charlie.They kept trying to get past me, but I juststood there.\" It was tough love, but Coltman believed in his teacher and, sure enough, it worked. \"I always say that Ben Spock saved my medical school career,\" says Coltman. And Coltman's career certainly soared after graduation. You can barely count his current appoint- ments on one hand, let alone the positions hefilled during more than 40 years of clinicalresearch and administration. He is president and chief executive officer of the CancerTherapy and Research Center inSan Antonio, Texas, director ofthe San Antonio CancerInstitute, professor at theUniversity of Texas HealthScience Center, and chairman ofthe Southwest Oncology Group,the nation's largest multidisease,multidisciplinary organizationdevoted to clinical trials relatedto Under Coltman'sdirection, the group has madeenormous research strides: sevenFDA approved cancer therapiesfor treating leukemia, cancers ofthe prostate, ovary, bladder, andcolon; a network of 4,000 inves-tigators conducting cancerresearch at more than 375 insti-tutions in 41 states as well as Canada andKorea; and the largest-ever prostate cancerprevention trial\u2014in which 18,882 men haveenrolled since 1993. \"He has, essentially, three or four full-time jobs,\" says Richard I. Fisher, chairman of thelymphoma committee for the group. \"He probably has more responsibilities than any other oncology leader in the country.\" But Coltman's research work didn't begin in Texas. Like much of his training, it beganin Pittsburgh, surrounded by the cries ofchildren.
