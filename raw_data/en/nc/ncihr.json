Vitamin D Balanced Blend: A easy to absorb high dose vitamin D paired with bioactive vitamin K to support utilization where needed while preventing calcification of soft tissues. This balanced blend provides a clinically useful dose of vitamin D3 along with vitamin K as both K1 and the MK-7 form of K2 to support absorption and reduced risk of calcification.

Why Naturally Nourished - Potency - Clinical Results - Synergistic Formulas - Third Party Tested - Purity Benefits The Relationship Between Vitamin D and Vitamin K Vitamins D and K are essential for optimal bone and arterial health and for maintaining a healthy immune system. Vitamins D and K work as a team. Increasing the amount of vitamin D via supplementation, in the presence of insufficient levels of vitamin K, can increase the risk of inappropriate calcium deposition in the soft tissue (such as arteries and joints), and can have a negative effect on blood vessel elasticity. However, when adequate levels of vitamin K are present along with vitamin D, calcium can be properly directed to the necessary areas of the body, mainly in bones and teeth. Increasing vitamin D levels increases the need for vitamin K. The amount of vitamins D and K in this formula may be beneficial for those who do not get adequate sun exposure and/or dietary sources of these vitamins. The Role of Vitamin D Vitamin D assists with proper bone health, as it helps regulate the body's calcium levels. When calcium levels are low, vitamin D stimulates calcium absorption and reduces calcium excretion, thereby encouraging healthy bones and teeth. In addition, vitamin D helps to support a proper immune response in the body. Healthy prostate, colon and breast tissues are also supported by vitamin D. The Role of Vitamin K Both forms of vitamin K are important to our health: Vitamin K1 (phytonadione) is the naturally occurring form, found predominantly in leafy green vegetables; while vitamin K2 (Menaquinone-7) is a product of soy fermentation and has the special property of metabolizing slowly throughout the day. Vitamin K is important for directing the transport of calcium into bone and teeth for optimal strength. How to Use Take 1 daily with food or as recommended by your healthcare provider. Taking at meal time enhances absorption as you will have fat in your meals and vitamin D is fat soluble. Based on your level of vitamin D deficiency, you may take two capsules for a period of time to get levels back to optimal status, discuss and monitor with your provider. It is recommended to monitor vitamin D levels semi-annually when using vitamin D supplementation. Aim for a range within 50-100 ng/mL. If your value is over 90, consider reducing from daily use to ever other day. CAUTION: Vitamin K may adversely interact with anticoagulation drugs known as blood thinners. Patients taking these medications should be medically supervised while taking this product. Want to know your Vitamin D status?
