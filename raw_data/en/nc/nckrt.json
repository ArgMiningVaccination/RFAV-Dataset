Sunday Jan 12th, 2019 4:30-6:30 pm All Levels Yin yoga class and cleanse friendly pot luck! Yin is a style of yoga where postures are held for longer periods of time thus targeting the connective tissue of the body. Physically, this allows us to affect change in the ligaments, tendons, and fascia (the connective tissue around and within the muscle). Most of the postures are done close to the floor and target the hips and spine. Poses are held anywhere from 45 seconds to 5 minutes facilitating healing of the body and the mind. This class is appropriate for all levels. This is a nourishing practice. This is an opportunity to practice a deeper pause, giving you the time to process, sit with and observe what is showing up for you during the course of this Kick Start Cleanse. Then!!! We Eat!!
