Healthline only shows you brands and products that we stand behind.Our team thoroughly researches and evaluates the recommendations we make on our site. To establish that the product manufacturers addressed safety and efficacy standards, we: - Evaluate ingredients and composition: Do they have the potential to cause harm? - Fact-check all health claims: Do they align with the current body of scientific evidence? - Assess the brand: Does it operate with integrity and adhere to industry best practices? What do you do when your energy feels off-kilter? According to some, it could be stemming from your chakras. The word \"chakra\" comes from Sanskrit, and means \"disk\" or \"wheel.\" Chakras are energy centers in the body that correlate to certain psycho-emotional functions. They each correspond to certain nerve bundles and major organs in the body. It's important to keep your chakras open and energy flowing smoothly, according to proponents of energy healing. Otherwise they may become blocked and cause physical or emotional issues. Some people turn to aromatherapy to balance their chakras. They use essential oils to recalibrate their body's energy centers and keep things flowing smoothly. While there are believed to be at least [114 chakras in the body](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342562977_A_Brief_History_of_the_Chakras_in_Human_Body), most people are familiar with the main seven chakras that loosely fall along the length of the spine. Each of these [seven chakras](/health/what-are-chakras) corresponds to a different organ in your body and is believed to play a part in your consciousness and perception of reality. This can have physical, emotional, and spiritual impacts. Some people believe [essential oils](/nutrition/what-are-essential-oils) can balance the chakras, with specific oils offering different effects for each chakra. \"People use essential oils for chakras to access the information contained within a chakra center and to be able to direct very specific energies towards personal growth and healing,\" explains [Candice Covington](https://divinearchetypes.org/pages/about-us). Covington explains that chakras are \"spinning wheels of energy, psychic centers that exist not on the physical plane, but rather in the spiritual dimension.\" Chakras determine the frequencies responsible for human experience, Covington adds. It's her belief that essential oils can aid in reformatting old patterns in our chakras by working with energies outside of our personal will. \"Essential oils tonify the chakras, meaning they bring the positive gifts forward and help bring balance to the shadow aspects,\" Covington says. \"They offer the stable foundation onto which we can consciously craft our inner and outer world.\" It's important to note that scientific research supporting the health benefits of essential oils is limited. A [2011 study](https://core.ac.uk/reader/37962413?utm_source=linkout) suggests that some essential oils can help lessen stress and anxiety when used in tandem with traditional medicine. [Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3159017/) In a [2012 review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22285469/) While the research is mixed, many people claim to enjoy the chakra-balancing benefits of essential oils. You can experiment for yourself with minimal risk as long as you keep [safety precautions](/health/are-essential-oils-safe) in mind. Always do a [patch test](/health/allergy-testing#testing) before using essential oils on your skin or in a bath. If there's no irritation, you can proceed with using the essential oil. Still, be sure to dilute it in [carrier oil](/health/carrier-oil) before applying it to your skin or adding it to your bath. It's also important to follow the [appropriate dosage and dilution](https://naha.org/explore-aromatherapy/about-aromatherapy/methods-of-application/) depending on how you're using the oils. These differ for where on the body you're applying the oil and whether the oil is being used by children or adults, or with pets nearby. You can also use a [dilution calculator](https://blog.mountainroseherbs.com/essential-oil-dilutions?correlationId=null) when in doubt. Also think about who else is inhaling the aroma. Children and pregnant or breastfeeding people may have negative reactions. People with allergies or asthma may not be able to tolerate aromatherapy or being in rooms where they are diffused or applied. And some essential oils are toxic to pets. Be sure to do your research before using essential oils for healing. While research suggests there are health benefits, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't monitor or regulate the purity or quality of essential oils. It's important to talk with your healthcare provider before you begin using essential oils. Be sure to research the [quality](/health/best-essential-oils) of a brand's products. Always do a [patch test](https://www.healthline.com/health/allergy-testing#testing) before trying a new essential oil. The root chakra is an earth element chakra located at the base of your spine.
