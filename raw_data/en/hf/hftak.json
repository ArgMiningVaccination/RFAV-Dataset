The High Commissioner contributes to the Secretary-General's Strategic Framework, in particular through Programme 20, Human Rights. In addition, the High Commissioner's Office (OHCHR/UN Human Rights) details her priorities, expected results and strategies in the UN Human Rights Management Plan. The High Commissioner's Management Plan for 2022 and 2023 aligns an ambitious vision for promoting and protecting human rights with a proven results-based programming framework. It extends and updates the priorities, results and strategies that have guided UN Human Rights over the previous four years. In so doing, it sustains the six thematic pillars that under - gird OHCHR's global efforts to advance the enjoyment by all of all civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. The promise of human rights A devastating worldwide pandemic, a pressing global development agenda, an uprising of pro - tests in response to abhorrent racial violence: today's compelling challenges to human dignity, justice, social progress and better standards of life are answered by the promise of human rights. Yet respecting, protecting and fulfilling human rights is more than a promise. From the United Nations Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, United Nations human rights system and its mechanisms, to Member State obligations and commitments and civil society advocacy: a global movement and architecture works every day to improve people's lives. It confronts global challenges, with a view to advancing the human condition. It confronts injustice, in order to pre - serve individual freedom and human dignity. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights guides and supports these efforts. Her voice, expertise and global engagement are dedicated to promoting and protecting the effective enjoyment by all of all civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. \u00a9 Markus Spiske on Unsplash6 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023PILLARS 1. Advance sustainable development through human rights. 2. Enhance equality and counter discrimina - tion. 3. Enhance participation and protect civic space. 4. Increase implementation of the outcomes of the international human rights mechanisms. 5. Prevent violations and strengthen protection of human rights, including in situations of conflict and insecurity. 6. Strengthen the rule of law and accountabil - ity for human rights violations. Building on the foundation of these thematic pil - lars, the extended Management Plan defines six shifts , which are thematic focuses that respond to our changing world. Each shift is mainstreamed through every pillar , thereby supporting coher - ence across OHCHR's work. One of the shifts is composed of diverse frontier issues . Frontier issues are developing themes that OHCHR will further explore, to better understand their impacts on human rights. SHIFTS 1. Inequality 2. Frontier issues: climate change; corruption; digital space and emerging technologies; people on the move 3. Global constituency for human rights 4. Leveraging data for human rights 5. Protect and expand civic space 6. Prevention of conflict, violence and insecurity While OHCHR maintains its unequivocal commitment to combating all forms of dis - crimination, it also shines a spotlight on certain populations. It engages with specific groups who are constructive agents of change and seek to fulfil their potential. Thereby, OHCHR rein - forces its contribution to the guiding principle of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda), to Leave No One Behind. SPOTLIGHT POPULATIONS 1. Persons with disabilities 2. Women 3. Young people 4. People of African descent The extended Management Plan for 2022 and 2023 reaffirms a commitment to continuous internal improvement for better programme delivery through its Organizational Effectiveness Action Plans (OEAPs ). OEAPs enable OHCHR to operate more effectively and efficiently and, as a result, achieve more positive human rights outcomes. Ten areas are prioritized for this two- year period. ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS ACTIONS PLANS 1. Digital technology 2. Dynamic knowledge 3. External communications 4. Diversity and inclusion 5. Innovation 6. Managing talent 7. Operations management 8. Resource mobilization 9. Strategic leadership and direction 10. Sustainable environmental management This comprehensive framework guides OHCHR in its collaboration with Member States, civil society, other partners and the United Nations System to promote and protect human rights worldwide. While the previous four-year period put exceptional strains on human rights, the extension of this framework through 2022 and 2023 reflects its adaptability to the myriad chal - lenges confronting humanity. Moreover, the UN Human Rights Management Plan for 2022 and 2023 does not merely extend this framework; it also recalibrates, renews and introduces work areas to sharpen OHCHR's engagement with immediate opportunities and challenges.7 THE PROMISE OF HUMAN RIGHTS Results Architecture ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS ACTION PLANS SHIFTS PILLARS SPOTLIGHT POPULATIONS ALL HUMAN RIGHTS FOR ALL Peace and Security Development Mechanisms Accountability Dynamic Knowledge Managing our TalentDiversity and Inclusion External Communications Strategic Leadership and Direction Operations ManagementInnovation Resource Mobilization Sustainable Environmental Management Digital TechnologyWomen Young People Persons with DisabilitiesPeople of African Descent ParticipationNon- Discrimination Working to Protect and Expand Civic Space Suppo rting a Global Constituency for Human Rights Inequalities Helping Prevent Conflict, Violence and Insecurity Promoting Human Rights in the Context of \"Frontier Issues\" Leveraging Data for Human Rights 8 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023TODAY'S COMPELLING CHALLENGES The global pandemic brings new immediacy to the promise of human rights. If its rapid and pervasive reshaping of our daily lives portends profound long-term changes for our world, Covid-19 already presents clear and urgent human rights challenges. The extraordinary circumstances of the pan - demic may in certain situations necessitate emergency measures. Where such measures lack sunset clauses or restrict freedom of movement, they raise questions regarding respect for other human rights. In some cases, such measures appear to be used repressively, for example to limit peaceful assembly or freedom of expres - sion. In many instances, discrimination, hate speech, xenophobia and targeting of certain groups ensue from the fear and tension generated by Covid-19. These circumstances require ongo - ing, rigorous scrutiny of states of emergency and related measures and their impacts. A revitalized appreciation of the right to health is indispensable. Prior to the global pandemic, over half of the world population could not access essential health services. A generation of underinvestment in health systems has been compounded by the stress of Covid-19, creat - ing an unparalleled public health crisis. The crisis is reflected in inadequate staffing and lack of equipment and other resources to treat Covid-19, as well as severe reductions in ser - vices and treatments for a wide range of critical health concerns. We need bold action to rectify an alarming inequality in access to Covid-19 vaccines, a vigorous focus on the social deter - minants of health, and an explicit commitment to establishing public health systems that give priority to fulfilling the right to health for all. One salient effect of the global pandemic is to cruelly expose the negative human rights impacts of inequality: rising poverty rates but falling attention to the right to development, notably Sustainable Development Goal 10; lack of access to social protection, livelihoods, employment, housing, water and sanitation, justice, educa - tion, as well as information, knowledge and skills. High levels of inequality correlate with underfunding of public services, systemic dis - crimination and low access to essential social services. These and other adverse impacts are most evident in situations of economic instabil - ity, corruption, crime, and poor physical and mental health and wellbeing. Accumulated dis - advantages and deprivation steadily deepen the marginalization of vulnerable groups. The UN Secretary-General made clear in Our Common Agenda and his Call to Action for Human Rights that building back better and Leave No One Behind can overcome the inequality challenge, in particular when pan - demic responses and development policies and programmes are anchored in a comprehensive approach to human rights. Beyond delivering universal access to the right to health, the top priorities are to accelerate the fulfilment of eco - nomic and social rights, facilitate broad and inclusive participation, and confront patterns of discrimination. People of African descent have long borne the harmful effects of combined discrimination and violence, which have been shaped by historical legacies and reinforced by cycles of structural inequality. Systemic racism is manifested where poverty is concentrated, unemployment rates are disproportionate, wages are depressed and peo - ple have less access to adequate housing; where people live in segregated, disadvantaged and hazardous neighbourhoods, lack proportionate access to quality education, healthcare and land, and fair public participation and representation. All these deprivations are worsened by systemic racism in law enforcement and criminal justice and a lack of accountability and redress for victims. At the same time, people of African descent have been pivotal in pressing for systemic reform to achieve the full realization of human rights. These reforms are embraced by a worldwide movement calling for racial justice and equal - ity. Transformative change begins with ending denial and impunity, building trust, ensuring that the voices of people of African descent and those standing up against racism are heard and acted on, and confronting legacies of the past, in particular by delivering reparatory justice, equity and equality. With strong political will and leadership, systemic racism and structural inequalities can be dismantled. A forceful call to produce and apply data and sta - tistics to support decision- and policy-making, 9 THE PROMISE OF HUMAN RIGHTS analysis, assessment and advocacy can be heard in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Secretary-General's Our Common Agenda , the Prevention Agenda, the Data Strategy, and the System-wide Roadmap for Innovating United Nations Data and Statistics. This vision sees the United Nations as a data-driven organization, in which data are at the centre of all strategies, lead to innovation, are integrated across United Nations ecosystems, and deliver optimal value for the Organization, people and the planet. The vision is highly pertinent to human rights. There is vast potential to leverage data to improve analysis and decision-making across the full spectrum of human rights. Supporting national statistical systems to produce fit- for-purpose data and statistics is one focus, especially with respect to identifying margin - alized groups and the need to Leave No One Behind. Another is to improve understanding of the human rights dimensions of inequality, particularly characteristics such as age, eth - nicity, income, disability, geographic location, migration status, race, gender and sex, and so reinforce advocacy and programming to deliver the 2030 Agenda. Targeted and disaggregated data bolster accountability by confirming trends in human rights and the conduct of duty bearers. Recognizing the power of data and its applica - tion to human rights challenges is an important first step towards leveraging information to pro - mote and protect human rights. The extended UN Human Rights Management Plan for 2022 and 2023 sharpens the focus on three compelling challenges: inequality , the situation of people of African descent , and leveraging data for human rights . It does so in an overall framework of priorities, expected results and strategies that promote and protect all human rights everywhere. FROM GLOBAL MANDATE TO INDIVIDUAL HUMAN DIGNITY: THEORY OF CHANGE OHCHR's theory of change concerns the inter - mediate results to which the Office contributes as it pursues its long-term goal - all human rights for all. It articulates the rationale for selecting those results and describes the Office's overarch - ing strategy to achieve them, including specific interventions and the means those interventions employ. It is grounded in a UN human rights- based approach, meaning it is based on human rights norms and standards as well as the work of the international human rights mechanisms. It pursues changes related to duty bearers and rights holders and includes results related to the human rights principles of non-discrimination, participation and accountability. The General Assembly mandated the High Commissioner for Human Rights, inter alia, to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. The General Assembly specified that the High Commissioner should provide advisory services and technical and financial assistance, engage in dialogue, enhance inter - national cooperation and coordinate activities throughout the UN System - all with a view to removing obstacles and meeting challenges to full realization of all human rights. The High Commissioner's vision for fulfilment of this mandate gives priority to addressing the most pressing human rights violations; focuses attention on those who are most at risk; gives equal attention to the realization of all human rights - including the right to development; and measures impact through the substantive ben - efits that individuals perceive and experience. In pursuit of this vision, OHCHR contributes to ten results, which it defines based on recurrent gaps identified in the course of its own work and the work of the international human rights mechanisms. The ten results describe intended institutional, legislative or behavioural changes in three distinct areas: national human rights protection systems; the international human rights protection system; and the engagement of international actors in promoting and protecting human rights. The programmatic assumption is 10 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023that, if these results are achieved, duty bearers will uphold their human rights obligations and rights holders will claim their rights, thereby improving the enjoyment of all rights by all. At the international level, UN Human Rights seeks to ensure that duty bearers: uphold their human rights obligations by supporting Member States to engage with the international human rights mechanisms and bodies; develop inter - national and regional human rights laws and institutions; and enhance the coherence of the international human rights mechanisms. OHCHR supports the involvement of the international community in promoting and protecting human rights, in particular by deliv - ering information, analysis and advocacy to encourage increased responsiveness to critical human rights situations. In order to enable rights holders to claim their rights, OHCHR promotes and facilitates their engagement with the inter - national human rights mechanisms. In addition, UN Human Rights works across the UN System to ensure that human rights are integrated in UN policies and programmes worldwide. With respect to national protection systems, OHCHR seeks to ensure that duty bearers uphold their human rights obligations by sup - porting efforts to ensure that national legislation, policies, programmes and institutions comply with international human rights standards; that States ratify international human rights treaties and review reservations; that State institutions but also non-State actors and the private sec - tor promote, protect and respect human rights; and that protection systems and accountability mechanisms monitor, investigate and redress human rights violations effectively. OHCHR also assists rights holders - especially women and groups subject to discrimination - to claim their rights by raising their awareness, using national protection systems, and participating in public processes. Human rights impacts at international, regional and national level also depend on the extent to which interventions are adapted to specific con - texts, sequenced to meet needs, and delivered through a combination of global, regional and national engagement. With this in mind, UN Human Rights' programmes provide expert advice; facilitate learning and knowledge trans - fer; deliver human rights education; monitor and report publicly; communicate and advocate for human rights; protect at-risk individuals; facil - itate dialogue between diverse stakeholders on human rights issues; build networks and alli - ances to extend human rights promotion and protection; and support the work of the inter - national human rights mechanisms. The High Commissioner's Management Plan brings together this global mandate, ambitious vision, targeted interventions around a proven results framework. At its heart are the core results that guide the UN Human Rights Office as it supports duty bearers to fulfil their human rights obligations and empowers rights holders to claim their rights. The ten core results express the High Commissioner's mandate in program - matic terms. Broad in scope, without time limits, and applicable to many thematic work areas, they are organized, expressed and pur - sued through OHCHR's framework of pillars , shifts and spotlight populations . In the end, UN Human Rights' ability to make progress toward its goals relies on delivery of its Organizational Effectiveness Action Plans, which make contin - uous organizational improvements to deliver human rights impact. \u00a9 Jon Tyson on Unsplash11 THE PROMISE OF HUMAN RIGHTS Theory of change ALL HUMAN RIGHTS FOR ALL NATIONAL PROTECTION SYSTEMS RIGHTS-HOLDERS CLAIM THEIR RIGHTSDUTY-BEARERS COMPLY WITH THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS State laws and policies protect and promote human rights State institutions, non-state actors and the private sector promote, protect and respect human rights State accountability mechanisms monitor, investigate and provide redress for human rights violations International and regional human rights mechanisms and bodies promote and protect human rights effectively The international community responds effectively to critical human rights situations and issues International human rights law and standards progress Human rights are effectively integrated in UN policies and programmes Public participation in policy-making processes grows, particularly by women and members of groups facing discrimination Public support grows for protection of human rights Member States and other actors engage with United Nations human rights mechanisms NATIONAL PROTECTION SYSTEMSINTERNATIONAL PROTECTION SYSTEMSINVOLVEMENT OF OTHER ACTORS Standard SettingAdvocacy and Awareness-raising Technical Cooperation and Advisory ServicesBuilding Partnerships Monitoring and Reporting12 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023UN Human Rights around the world in 2021 HQ ArgentinaNew York ColombiaBarbados Ecuador Republic Libya (UNSMIL)State of Palestine*** (Gaza and Ramallah) JordanSyria - based in Beirut Middle East and North Africa (Beirut) Mali (MINUSMA) G5 Sahel - Mali**** South America (Santiago de Chile)BrazilUN Human Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab Region (Doha)Headquarters 2 19 12 11 53 7Country/Stand-alone Offices/ Human Rights Missions Regional Offices/Centres Human rights components of UN Peace/Political Missions Human Rights Advisers deployed under the framework of the UNSDG Other types of field presences102 field presences2 HQ locations+13 THE PROMISE OF HUMAN RIGHTS UN Sub-Regional Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Central Africa (Yaound\u00e9)Bahrain Saudi Arabia * Reference to Kosovo should be understood in full compliance with United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 and without prejudice to the status of Kosovo. ** Mandated by Human Rights Council resolution 25/25. *** Reference to the State of Palestine should be understood in compliance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19. *** * G5 Sahel Joint Force Compliance Framework Project (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger).

Contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is there - fore a central thrust of the High Commissioner's extended Management Plan for 2022-2023. This is reflected in the results-based planning frame - work and the interventions that follow from UN Human Rights' theory of change. The Management Plan presents OHCHR's new and updated country and sub-regional pro - grammes. These programmes reflect OHCHR's contributions to United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks (UNSDCF), where such frameworks have been put in place. Aligning country and sub-regional programmes to UNSDCFs increases impact through United Nations Country Teams, con - tributes to potential joint reporting by the UN System, and further demonstrates that respect - ing, protecting and fulfilling human rights obligations is essential to the 2030 Agenda. 15 THE PILLARS OF OUR PROGRAMMEThe pillars of our programme A comprehensive approach to promote and protect all human rights The United Nations Charter declared that pro - moting and encouraging respect for human rights is one of the Organization's main pur - poses. OHCHR's responsibility to lead the United Nations' work to fulfil this purpose requires an approach that is comprehensive and universal, especially in terms of geographic and thematic engagement and partnership with Member States, regional organizations, civil society and the UN System. It further requires an approach that is inspired by an ambitious vision and grounded in a proven results-based programming framework. \u00a9 STOATPHOTO The extended UN Human Rights Management Plan for 2022-2023 defines such an approach through the following pillars , shifts , spotlight populations and organizational effectiveness action plans . Six thematic pillars constitute the foundation for OHCHR's work to promote and protect all human rights everywhere. 16 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023Pillar: Advance sustainable development through human rights Given that human rights are at the core of the SDGs, contributing to fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda is a principal objective of the High Commissioner's Management Plan. For 2022 and 2023, progress on the SDGs is ever more urgent, especially in light of the setbacks attrib - utable to the global pandemic. Our Common Agenda reinvigorates OHCHR's determination to contribute to the 2030 Agenda. It recognizes that the promise of human rights to serve individuals, communities and the whole of society is a fundamental element of the social contract. They provide tools to safeguard lives and livelihoods and measures to prevent griev - ances and solve problems. OHCHR's global engagement with the 2030 Agenda is guided by this recognition. OHCHR's engagement is also guided by the Declaration on the Right to Development, which acknowledges that all individuals and peoples have a right to free, active and meaningful partic - ipation. Such participation is only realized when individuals can rely on their inter-related and interdependent civil, cultural, economic, politi - cal and social rights. In consequence, OHCHR advances sustainable development through a comprehensive approach that highlights inequal - ity and the importance of leveraging data to protect human rights, even while it continues to work on priorities such as climate change, business and human rights, inclusive and par - ticipative economies, accountable governance, and Leave No One Behind. For 2022 and 2023, we continue to work with partners so that: JUDICIAL AND NON-JUDICIAL MECHANISMS HOLD BUSINESS AND OTHER ECONOMIC ACTORS TO ACCOUNT FOR RIGHTS ABUSES AND PROVIDE REMEDIES TO VICTIMS We continue to prioritize technical support, guidance and advocacy to increase the effective - ness of judicial and non-judicial accountability mechanisms and policies. These address human rights abuses arising from economic activity, including in cross border cases; clarify legal options for identifying practical measures that improve access to remedy for victims of human rights abuses that involve business and other economic actors, including in the technology and finance sectors; and strategically engage A student holds a placard reading \"I defend education\" during a protest against cuts to federal spending on higher education planned in Brazil, May 2019. \u00a9 REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes17 THE PILLARS OF OUR PROGRAMMEwith business and other economic actors to enhance accountability and access to remedy. BUSINESS ACTORS IMPLEMENT THE UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS EFFECTIVELY We remain committed to working strategically with States, businesses, civil society and other stakeholders to apply and integrate the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) in national, legal and policy frameworks relevant to business and other economic actors, and in company practice. We will advocate, support, convene and participate in multi-stakeholder and inter-governmental processes to develop and strengthen standards and policies in this area, and enter into strategic partnerships where appropriate with business and other actors to enhance implementation of the UNGPs. STATE AUTHORITIES ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT LAWS, POLICIES AND STRATEGIES ON LAND AND HOUSING THAT INCREASINGLY COMPLY WITH HUMAN RIGHTS We also remain committed to strengthen - ing efforts to: support authorities to integrate human rights standards when they draft and implement laws, policies and strategies on land and housing; assist accountability mechanisms to address forced evictions, homelessness, dis - placement, land grabs and other violations of housing, land and related rights such as food, water and sanitation; strengthen partnerships to increase awareness of the right to housing and land rights; and develop practical approaches to implement the commitment of the SDGs to Leave No One Behind with respect to housing, land and related human rights. PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACHES, INCLUDING SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH POLICIES, COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS AND PROVIDE NON-DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS, ESPECIALLY TO CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS, WOMEN AND MIGRANTS We continue to deepen understanding of the impact of discrimination on health rights, including by monitoring health care settings, and provide technical advice on the right to health of people who are marginalized or face discrimination. This work has added salience due to the challenges of the pandemic, which has amplified the importance of all health-related rights. In addition, we continue to seek to raise awareness among health workers of their role as human rights defenders and protect those who defend and promote human rights, including sexual and reproductive rights. We steadfastly promote and support protection of health-re - lated human rights during efforts to prevent or respond to conflicts, epidemics, natural disasters and other crises, and assist humanitarian actors to apply a rights-based approach to health in those situations. ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE POLICIES AND PLANS INCREASINGLY RESPECT, PROTECT AND FUFILL HUMAN RIGHTS, GUARANTEEING THOSE AFFECTED ACCESS TO INFORMATION, DECISION-MAKING, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND REMEDIES We increase our collaboration with partners to integrate human rights in environmental laws and policies; and press for access to informa - tion, effective remedies for victims, and the inclusion of civil society in environmental deci - sion-making processes. We assist human rights mechanisms to address environmental issues; advocate on behalf of environmental defenders and support efforts by the UN System to pro - tect them; and conduct research and advocacy to address human rights harms caused by envi - ronmental degradation, particularly to groups in vulnerable situations. HUMAN RIGHTS ASSESSMENTS AND IMPACT ANALYSES MITIGATE, PREVENT OR REDRESS THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC, TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES AND PROJECTS We continue to encourage and assist States and partners to apply human rights assessments and impact analyses to trade and investment poli - cies, environmental and social risk management, and development finance. We remain focused on helping to create and maintain safeguard poli - cies and independent accountability mechanisms 18 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023for development financing institutions, and sup - porting populations affected by them. We also remain focused on providing technical support to human rights mechanisms on methodologies, including in relation to the Guiding Principles for Human Rights Impact Assessments of Economic Reform Policies . STATES INTEGRATE HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT AND THE OUTCOMES OF HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS, AS THEY IMPLEMENT THE SDGs AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT AND POVERTY ERADICATION EFFORTS; THE UN SUPPORTS THEM IN THESE PURPOSES, INTEGRATING HUMAN RIGHTS IN ITS OWN DEVELOPMENT WORK We continue to encourage and support govern - ments, national human rights institutions and civil society to integrate human rights, including the right to development, when they implement, monitor or review the SDGs or other develop - ment efforts; and advocate for the integration of human rights in SDG processes in intergov - ernmental fora. We advocate for expanding civil society participation in SDG processes; document and communicate how integrating human rights in development reduces poverty and inequality; work to support the UN leader - ship's commitment to align, and advocate for the alignment of, development policies with human rights; and buttress the human rights expertise of Resident Coordinators and UNCTs in this area, inter alia by operationalizing the UN framework on equality and non-discrimination. We priori - tize the provision of expertise and support to the Working Group and the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Development and seek to expand support for the right to development, and its integration in the SDGs and work of the UN. NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, ASSISTED BY COMMUNITIES, SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECT, DISAGGREGATE AND APPLY DATA RELEVANT TO ADVANCING HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN THEY MONITOR AND IMPLEMENT THE SDGs We work to further improve the capacity of national institutions to collect, analyse and disaggregate data to identify those left behind, and promote the inclusion in data collection of groups who face discrimination. We continue to develop legal and practical guidance on human rights-based data collection and indicators, including on ways to manage risk; and seek to improve measurement of intersecting and mul - tiple forms of discrimination and inequality. We continue to seek to assist the international sta - tistical system to mainstream human rights in its standards and methods, and notably in the data disaggregation frameworks that measure and report on human rights indicators as part of SDG progress reports.

The extended Management Plan for 2022 and 2023 further prioritizes OHCHR's efforts to achieve equality and counter discrimination. The increasingly urgent need to overcome com - pounded inequalities is a principal feature of the Secretary-General's Call to Action for Human Rights and Our Common Agenda . UN Human Rights will focus even more on efforts to raise awareness of inequality and develop innovative approaches to address its human rights dimen - sions. This focus will be mainstreamed across all six pillars of the Management Plan and cor - relates closely with OHCHR's work to counter discrimination. UN Human Rights is strengthening its work on discrimination. A renewed focus on the situa - tion of people of African descent follows from the High Commissioner's Agenda Towards Transformative Change for Racial Justice and Equality. In parallel, OHCHR continues to work to counter all forms of discrimination, including against religious, ethnic and national minorities, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, migrants, older persons, children, women, and LGBTI, the latter especially through the UN Free & Equal campaign. In particular, recogniz - ing that Leave No One Behind means working towards equality and non-discrimination for all, UN Human Rights seeks to avail of the moment to break down structures that perpetuate gender discrimination and racism in order to recover better from the inequalities exacerbated by the global pandemic. For 2022 and 2023, we continue to work with partners so that: LAWS, POLICIES AND PRACTICES MORE EFFECTIVELY COMBAT DISCRIMINATION IN ALL FORMS, AND RESPONSIBLE AUTHORITIES ACTIVELY WORK TO \"LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND\", INCLUDING BY ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF INEQUALITY We continue to develop good practices and highlight promising initiatives to combat dis - crimination, and engage with policy makers to support implementation. Our priorities are to expose underlying discriminatory social norms and lead strategic advocacy to combat 22 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023discriminatory legislation, practices and policies; we oppose racial profiling and segregationist and stigmatizing practices. We will continue to facilitate and build new partnerships for positive change, and will seek in particular to ensure that no one is left behind in the implementation and monitoring of the SDGs. We will bolster local efforts to combat discrimination and encour - age youth to speak up against it. Identifying, understanding and addressing multiple and intersectional discrimination, countering the growing threat of hate speech and hate crimes, and advocating for the collection and publi - cation of data disaggregated by race or ethnic origin and its use to drive and assess policy responses, remain top priorities. JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND RELATED INSTITUTIONS INCREASINGLY MONITOR AND INVESTIGATE DISCRIMINATION AND PROVIDE REDRESS TO VICTIMS We are committed to: assisting formal and infor - mal justice systems to apply a victim-centred, human rights-based approach, through legal advice and technical assistance; encouraging and assisting States to address factors that contrib - ute to discriminatory outcomes and disparities in law enforcement and the administration of justice, including by gathering and analysing comparative data; monitoring and advocating against racial profiling, stereotypes and biases in and by law enforcement, the administration of justice, and sentencing; responding to racist behaviour, violence and hate crimes with the full force of the law; and assisting national inde - pendent accountability mechanisms and State institutions to monitor and investigate cases of discrimination. Empowering groups and indi - viduals facing discrimination to demand and access justice and accountability for violations, including by providing support for strategic lit - igation, continue to be priorities for OHCHR. Grounded in an intersectional and intergener - ational analysis, and with a view to delivering reparatory justice, we will continue to advocate for comprehensive approaches to repair the leg - acies of enslavement, the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans, and colonialism.LEGAL AND SOCIAL FRAMEWORKS INCREASINGLY PROMOTE WOMEN'S AND GIRLS' AUTONOMY AND CHANGE AND PROTECT THEM FROM VIOLENCE, INCLUDING IN THE DIGITAL SPHERE Efforts to promote women's and girls' auton - omy and comprehensively address gender-based violence (GBV) remain leading priorities for OHCHR. We continue to: assist in the devel - opment of non-discriminatory and adequate legal and policy frameworks, focusing on cus - tody, protection orders, access to social services, inheritance, nationality, labour, access to credit, and legal standing; pursue efforts to integrate human rights in policies that address abuse and violence online; develop evidence and rights- based guidance on GBV, harmful practices, and the appropriate use of criminal laws; and assess obstacles to women's and girls' participa - tion online. We remain focused on building the capacity of various actors, including civil society, to monitor gender-based violence and harmful practices, and press for appropriate approaches that promote women's and girls' autonomy and choice. We will use our convening role to create spaces for discussion and knowledge-sharing, and to reach out to new partners. JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS, MEDIA, AND OTHER SECTORS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZE AND CHALLENGE HARMFUL GENDER STEREOTYPES AND GENDER NORMS WITH A VIEW TO THEIR ERADICATION We will contribute research on how harmful gen - der stereotypes and social norms in the media, the justice system and digital space undermine gender equality. We will also contribute tools and guidance to build the capacity of journal - ists, judges, digital technology companies and border control and law enforcement officers to address harmful gender biases in their work. We prioritize raising the awareness of youth and communities to assist civil society organizations to monitor and analyse gender stereotyping and challenge harmful social norms and bias. PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES EFFECTIVELY COUNTER DISCRIMINATION AND HATE SPEECH IN THE DIGITAL SPACE 23 THE PILLARS OF OUR PROGRAMMEWe continue to support analysis of the impact on human rights of artificial intelligence, big data, and discrimination and hate speech in the digi - tal space, and identify and clarify principles and best practices. Cooperation with Governments and the private sector to protect human rights in the digital space and tackle digital discrimina - tion and hate speech is a principal objective. In addition, we maintain our work to address the digital divide and to integrate human rights in the UN System's efforts in this area. THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL MIGRANTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN VULNERABLE SITUATIONS, ARE PROTECTED We monitor and report on the rights of migrants during all phases of the migration cycle; advo - cate for full implementation of the specific protections to which migrants in vulnerable situations are entitled; provide technical assis - tance, guidance materials and legal expertise in support of human rights-based approaches to migration governance; and strengthen the capacity of Member States, civil society, national human rights institutions and UN partners to advocate for and implement human rights-based approaches. We research and analyse migration concerns, focusing in particular on migrants in vulnerable situations, return and reintegration, and the human rights links between migration and climate change, poverty, women's rights and child protection. In addition, we contribute communication tools that reframe anti-migrant narratives and amplify the voices of migrants. PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR EQUAL, INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE SOCIETIES, WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION, INCREASES We continue to collect and disseminate evidence, human rights stories and effective messages in support of inclusion, especially about the neg - ative impacts of discrimination, and support communication strategies and multi-media campaigns, using social media tools, to reach youth and marginalized groups. We also con - tinue to support educational programmes, for schools and universities as well as different religious audiences, that focus on equality and non-discrimination. We collaborate with part - ners to increase public support for inclusive and diverse societies. THE UN SYSTEM IMPLEMENTS A COHERENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS-BASED RESPONSE TO INEQUALITY AND DISCRIMINATION, INCLUDING INTERSECTING AND MULTIPLE FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION We take a leading role in the UN's work on dis - crimination and social and economic inequality, especially in relation to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which provides an overarching framework for addressing struc - tural discrimination, exclusion and inequality within and between countries. We continue to prioritize support to UNCTs to ensure that the 2030 Agenda's commitment to Leave No One Behind is grounded in principles of equality and non-discrimination. We provide technical assistance for specific groups that are subject to discrimination, and in particular will follow up innovative ongoing research that explores the human rights dimensions of inequality in the context of fiscal and tax policy, social pro - tection, and labour rights. We will work to strengthen the UN System's capacity to identify and respond to potential violations and warning signs of discrimination and inequality.

Yet participation only flourishes where rights to freedom of assembly, associa - tion and expression are cultivated. Creating and securing such civic space improves policy devel - opment and implementation, in particular of human rights, but also sustainable development and peace and security. OHCHR remains deter - mined to promote and protect civic space - and those who stand up for human rights - and the High Commissioner's extended Management Plan reinforces this work in 2022 and 2023. The importance of promoting and protecting participation and civic space is underscored throughout the Secretary-General's Call to Action for Human Rights and Our Common Agenda . Whereas the former inspired a UN-wide strategy to better protect civic space, the latter calls for inclusion, protection and participation - key elements of civic space - as humanity defines a renewed social contract anchored in human rights. An enabling civic space is also imper - ative to answer the appeal of Our Common Agenda for global solidarity to break through to a greener, safer and better future. UN Human Rights reaffirms its unwavering commitment to enhance participation and pro - tect civic space. Knowing that participation and civic space must be addressed in the context of work on inequalities, corruption, discrimination and the digital space, as well its potential to alle - viate grievances, prevent conflict and contribute to eliminating impunity, OHCHR will reinforce its monitoring and public advocacy in this area and redouble efforts to mainstream civic space issues throughout the UN System. For 2022 and 2023, we continue to work with partners so that: STRONGER LAWS, POLICIES AND PRACTICES PROTECT CIVIC SPACE, INCLUDING ONLINE, AND THE ENVIRONMENT FOR CIVIL SOCIETY IS INCREASINGLY SAFE AND ENABLING We will continue to support the adoption and implementation of laws and policies that protect civic space and the right to participate. We will also continue to promote dialogue, to participate in law-making processes and to develop guide - lines on effective implementation of the right to participate. One focus will be cities and local governments. We will resist attempts to restrict civic space and will support litigation and access 26 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023to justice for civil society actors. In addition, we remain committed to developing and advocating for the application of human rights in the digi - tal space, as online civic space and participation continue to increase exponentially. THE UN SYSTEM AND INTERNATIONAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL MECHANISMS PROVIDE INCREASED, TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE PROTECTION TO CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS (INCLUDING FROM REPRISALS) We remain committed to advocating for stron - ger protection of individuals and groups at risk and working with the UN System and interna - tional human rights mechanisms in this respect. We will continue to monitor and report cases of human rights violations against civil society actors, especially reprisals against individuals who cooperate with the UN on human rights, and will work to build upon and replicate good protection practices. We remain determined to reinforce the capacity of UN human rights mech - anisms to protect all civil society actors and will continue to reach out to partners to help us in this regard. BUSINESS, POLICY-MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE INCREASINGLY VALUE AND SUPPORT CIVIC SPACE We will continue to collect evidence to demon - strate the value of civic space and participation and to challenge negative human rights narra - tives; to develop targeted messages on the value of civic space; and promote public recognition of the legitimacy and contributions of human rights defenders. We reiterate our commitment to reach out to new audiences and use our con - vening power to build support for civic space and participation. CIVIL SOCIETY ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IS STRENGTHENED We renew our efforts to further strengthen the UN Voluntary Funds for Victims of Torture and Contemporary Forms of Slavery, which assist victims through grants to civil society actors. We will continue to make their work better known; simplify the application process; expand partnerships with doctors, psychologists, social workers, lawyers and other professional groups, including national medical associations and bar associations; and build their capacity by devel - oping tools on redress and rehabilitation, based on organizations' experience. MORE SYSTEMATIC MONITORING OF THE ENVIRONMENT FOR CIVIC SPACE, INCLUDING THREATS TO IT, TAKES PLACE We will continue to support and participate in global efforts to monitor the enabling envi - ronment for civic space. We will facilitate the collection and exchange of relevant data, through online platforms, and the implemen - tation of SDG indicator 16.10.1 (number of verified cases of killing, kidnapping, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention and torture of journalists, associated media personnel, trade unionists and human rights advocates). We will also continue to improve data-collection method - ologies on civic space on and off-line; strengthen analytical, communication and advocacy tools that make effective use of data to support civic space; build monitoring networks that include non-traditional partners; and encourage the UN to support action to defend civic space. THE VOICE OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY VICTIMS AND THOSE WHO FACE DISCRIMINATION, IS MORE CLEARLY HEARD We remain committed to advocating for the participation of civil society in decision-making processes at all levels in different areas, inter alia in matters of development, peace and security, the environment, and corruption. We continue to encourage use of information and communi - cations technology and social media to promote broad-based consultations. We also remain committed to helping rights holders build their capacity, by assisting their organizations to par - ticipate effectively in decision-making processes, advocating for their participation, and foster - ing dialogue across movements. In so doing, we reiterate our determination to ensure gender balance and increasingly involve youth. 27 THE PILLARS OF OUR PROGRAMMEPUBLIC RECOGNITION THAT HUMAN RIGHTS AND ACCOUNTABILITY MAKE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO EFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO VIOLENCE, INCLUDING TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM, INCREASES We will continue to gather evidence, includ - ing data, examples, and stories of resilience, of the contributions that human rights make to effective responses to terrorism and violent extremism. We will continue to develop public campaigns, assist stakeholders to use evidence for their own advocacy, and support strategic partnerships that can disseminate our message and reach new audiences.

Monitoring, analysis and interaction with Member States and other stakeholders identify challenges to human rights law and practice and create opportunities to improve the normative human rights framework. The High Commissioner's extended Management Plan for 2022 and 2023 reiterates UN Human Rights' commitment to strengthen the links between the human rights mechanisms, Member States, the UN System and an array of other stakeholders, particularly to support the implementation of recommendations at coun - try level. This determination is buttressed by the Secretary-General's Call to Action for Human Rights , which makes clear how much the mech - anisms can contribute to UN-wide efforts to promote and protect human rights and realize the SDGs. OHCHR's support to the mechanisms is guided by the need to fulfil their potential and deliver in full on the promise of all human rights for all people. For 2022 and 2023, we continue to work with partners so that: NATIONAL INSTITUTIONALIZED STRUCTURES FACILITATE AN INTEGRATED AND PARTICIPATORY APPROACH TO REPORTING TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS We will increase our efforts to help develop new systems and support National Mechanisms for Reporting and Follow up (NMRF), in order to further improve implementation of the rec - ommendations of all international human rights mechanisms. We maintain our unequiv - ocal commitment to support Governments to continuously strengthen their engagement, coordination, consultation and information management capacity with a focus on ensuring meaningful consultations, and will assist States to develop implementation plans and use related tracking databases. Model terms of reference for an NMRF, training materials, guidelines and 30 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023checklists, as well as the dissemination of good practices, remain central to these efforts. CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS, NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS AND NON-TRADITIONAL ACTORS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WORKING ON EMERGING HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES (FRONTIER ISSUES), INCREASINGLY ENGAGE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS AND USE THEIR OUTCOMES We will continue to support engagement with civil society organizations, national human rights institutions, and non-traditional actors, to build networks for cross-learning, creatively use new technologies, and facilitate exchanges of information during the mechanisms' hearings. We will continue to carry out awareness-raising activities and develop capacity-building tools for outreach and to increase engagement with new actors. POLICY-MAKERS, LEGISLATORS AND COURTS MAKE INCREASED USE OF THE OUTCOMES OF THE INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS The outcomes continue to include thematic and country recommendations, but also interim and urgent protection measures. We will sustain efforts to ramp up their dissemination by the United Nations inter-agency coordination teams at country level and State officials. We assist pol - icy makers, legislators and courts to translate them into national policies, laws and decisions; and put processes in place to ensure that urgent measures reach relevant actors promptly. INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS CONTRIBUTE TO THE ELABORATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE, IN PARTICULAR IN THE CONTEXT OF EMERGING HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS (FRONTIER ISSUES) We support efforts, led by the mechanisms, to identify gaps in international law and produce jurisprudential guidance on emerging human rights issues. We will continue to: deepen our in-house capacity and to identify experts and key forums, in association with States, UN and regional bodies, NHRIs and civil society organizations; organize platforms and meetings to elaborate legal issues and clarify standards; increase the collaboration and involvement of the mechanisms with regional human rights organizations; and develop guidelines to facil - itate their engagement in judicial proceedings, as amicus curiae or expert witnesses. INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS ARE INCREASINGLY EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING AND PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS It remains a priority to make the mechanisms more coherent and promote further integration of the processes that influence their operation. For this purpose, we will continue to: under - line to the mechanisms and State officials the importance of concrete, practical and mutual - ly-reinforcing recommendations; develop policy and capacity-building tools to ensure that a holistic approach is adopted when mechanisms' recommendations are implemented; and develop information tools for analysing human rights trends and patterns, to improve crisis prevention and early warning. We will work to ensure that the mechanisms are more accessible and visible, through videoconferencing and webcasting. We have adopted an agile approach to the use of new technologies to support uninterrupted function - ing of the human rights mechanisms, including in the context of the current global pandemic. We remain committed to effectively document - ing and disseminating stories about the impact the mechanisms have on peoples' lives.31 THE PILLARS OF OUR PROGRAMMEPillar Results: Increase implementation of the outcomes of the international human rights mechanisms THE SPECIFIC PILLAR RESULTS WE CONTRIBUTE TO SHIFTS M MechanismsM1National institutionalized structures facilitate an integrated and participatory approach to reporting to the human rights mechanisms and implementation of their recommendations.Prevention | Leveraging Data | Global Constituency | Civic Space | SDG 16, 17 M2Civil society organizations, national human rights institutions, and non-traditional actors, particularly those working on emerging human rights issues (frontier issues), increasingly engage with the international human rights mechanisms and use their outcomes.Global Constituency | Civic Space | Inequalities | Frontier issues: Climate change, corruption, digital space, people on the move | SDG 16, 17 M3 Policy-makers, legislators and courts make increased use of the outcomes of the international and regional human rights mechanisms.Civic Space | Inequalities | Frontier issues: Climate change, corruption, digital space, people on the move | SDG 16 M4International human rights mechanisms contribute to the elaboration of international law and jurisprudence, in particular in the context of emerging human rights concerns (frontier issues).Inequalities | Frontier issues: Climate change, corruption, digital space, people on the move | SDG 16, 17 M5International human rights mechanisms are increasingly effective in promoting and protecting human rights.Prevention | Civic Space | SDG 16 D7States integrate human rights, including the right to development and human rights mechanisms' outcomes, as they implement the SDGs and other development and poverty eradication efforts; and the UN supports them in these purposes, integrating human rights in its own development work.Inequalities | Leveraging Data | SDG 1, 17 and all SDGs PS5Human rights information and analyses are integrated in early warning and analysis systems and influence international and national policy- making, strategies and operations to prevent, mitigate or respond to emerging crises, including humanitarian crises and conflict.Prevention | Civic Space | Leveraging Data | Frontier issues: Climate change, digital space, people on the move | SDG 17 P2The UN System and international, regional and national mechanisms provide increased, timely and effective protection to civil society organizations and individuals (including from reprisals).Civic Space | SDG 1632 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023Pillar: Prevent violations and strengthen protection of human rights, including in situations of conflict and insecurity A woman wearing a face mask and with a peace symbol painted on the forehead takes part in a demonstration asking for 'peace in the world', in Rome, Italy, 26 February 2022. \u00a9 EPA-EFE Fulfilling human rights obligations supports sus - tainable development and reduces insecurity and conflict. It also contributes to prevention and preparedness and builds resilience to other types of crisis, such as climate change and pandem - ics. When conflicts or crises occur, respecting human rights safeguards human dignity and creates conditions for peace, security and devel - opment. The High Commissioner's extended Management Plan for 2022 and 2023 maintains OHCHR's emphasis on policies and practices that prevent human rights violations. In his Call to Action for Human Rights , the Secretary-General refers to the UN's founda - tional purpose, to protect populations from violence, conflict and other threats. In under - lining that prevention remains a top priority, the Secretary-General has said that there is no better guarantee of prevention than for Member States to meet their human rights responsi - bilities. OHCHR is strongly focused on full realization of the vision set out in the Call to Action , including by leading development of the UN's agenda for protection and by working to instil prevention, protection and human rights in the UN System's awareness, decision-mak - ing and programming at field, regional and Headquarters levels. UN Human Rights builds on its substantial experience and expertise in preventing violations and protecting human rights in situations of conflict and insecurity. OHCHR's human rights information gathering, analysis and reporting contribute directly to early warning and guide early targeted action. Its work is applied in peacemaking, peacekeeping, peacebuilding and other settings. OHCHR will be persistent in its efforts to integrate prevention and protection in counter-terrorism policies and programmes to counter the spread of violent extremism, and address grievances that flow from inequalities and emerging technologies.33 THE PILLARS OF OUR PROGRAMMEFor 2022 and 2023, we continue to work with partners so that: PARTIES TO CONFLICT AND ACTORS INVOLVED IN PEACE OPERATIONS INCREASINGLY COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN LAW AND PROVIDE GREATER PROTECTION TO CIVILIANS We will continue to monitor human rights violations committed during armed conflicts, including civilian casualties and incidents of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). We will bring facts and evidence to the parties' and public attention, and advocate for changes in policy, practice and conduct; provide training and technical advice to integrate international human rights and humanitarian law in mili - tary and peace operations; strategically engage with parties to conflicts to both reduce human rights violations and integrate human rights in political decision-making and peace agreements; facilitate the participation of diverse groups, including women, in peace negotiations; and cooperate closely with regional and UN peace missions to ensure integration of human rights. EFFORTS TO COUNTER TERRORISM AND PREVENT VIOLENT EXTREMISM COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW We will continue to gather evidence and undertake research, monitoring and report - ing to support our strategic advocacy on the role of human rights violations in driving vio - lent extremism and terrorism, and the role of human rights protection in prevention. We are determined to consolidate the capacity and com - mitment of State authorities and other actors to respect international law in their efforts to combat terrorism and prevent violent extrem - ism, and ensure accountability and respect for victims' rights. STRATEGIES TO PREVENT AND RESPOND TO CONFLICT CONSISTENTLY INTEGRATE HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION We remain focused on actively engaging with UN entities, regional bodies and individual Member States to show that protection and promotion of human rights contribute to more effective conflict prevention, conflict manage - ment and post-conflict peace. To this end, we also focus on monitoring the implementation of relevant strategies, provide advice on what is needed to ensure effective human rights protec - tion, and provide training, operational guidance and technical advice on how to integrate human rights operationally in prevention and peace - building activities. JUSTICE MECHANISMS, INCLUDING FOR TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CONFLICT-RELATED VIOLATIONS We reiterate that it is a priority to document, map and report human rights violations and abuses and, in the context of conflict, breaches of international humanitarian law. We will do so especially by assisting inquiry mechanisms that seek to support accountability for con - flict-related violations in different jurisdictions, including through universal jurisdiction. We continue to support comprehensive transitional justice processes and the right of victims to an effective remedy. We will continue to develop guidance and tools on victim and witness pro - tection and participation, and will enhance the effectiveness of our support to justice institu - tions. Through justice and remedies for past violations, we seek to prevent new cycles of vio - lence and conflict. HUMAN RIGHTS INFORMATION AND ANALYSES ARE INTEGRATED IN EARLY WARNING AND ANALYSIS SYSTEMS AND INFLUENCE INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL POLICY-MAKING, STRATEGIES AND OPERATIONS TO PREVENT, MITIGATE OR RESPOND TO EMERGING CRISES, INCLUDING HUMANITARIAN CRISES AND CONFLICT We remain committed to developing informa - tion management practices and systems that deliver early warning analysis that can inform UN human rights prevention, early warning and intervention strategies. This capacity strength - ens our ability to identify potential crises and support responses. The 'Rights View' plat - form provides access to OHCHR information and other credible human rights sources and 34 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023media. We also remain committed to deploy - ing emergency response staff to regional offices, strengthening United Nations' work on the ground. UNITED NATIONS' SUPPORT TO NATIONAL AND REGIONAL SECURITY FORCES, LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, AND NON- STATE ACTORS INTEGRATES HUMAN RIGHTS AND COMPLIES WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS DUE DILIGENCE POLICY We continue to provide support, advice and training to UN partners to implement the Human Rights Due Diligence Policy (HRDDP). This policy sets out measures that all UN enti - ties should take to ensure that support that they provide to non-UN forces is consistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and with their responsibility to respect, pro - mote and encourage respect for international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law. These measures require UN entities to monitor and report on the conduct of security forces they support and assess the risk that they may commit grave violations. We have undertaken to strengthen accountability for implementa - tion of the policy; support the development of standard operating procedures, risk assessments and mitigation measures; and ensure that the HRDDP is applied systematically to all forms of UN support to security forces, including actions to counter terrorism and prevent violent extrem - ism, regional and peacebuilding operations, and border control. THE USE OF PRIVATE MILITARY AND SECURITY COMPANIES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, WEAPONS AND TACTICS, ARE INCREASINGLY CONSISTENT WITH AND RESPECT INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW We continue to deepen our understanding of the impacts on human rights and gender that the development and deployment of new tech - nologies, weapons and tactics will have. Within the framework of relevant OHCHR strategies, we will assist States and relevant stakeholders to put in place strong international account - ability frameworks to address human rights violations and abuses by private military and security companies (PMSCs), and will support national efforts to develop legislation, policies and practices that ensure that PMSCs comply with human rights standards.

Their effective operation establishes the rule of law, delivers accountability and prevents impunity for human rights violations. The High Commissioner's extended Management Plan reaffirms that strengthening the rule of law and accountability for human rights violations are leading priorities for 2022 and 2023. Advancing the rule of law is given fresh impe - tus in the light of Our Common Agenda , which emphasizes the need for a renewed social contract anchored in human rights. In that doc - ument, the Secretary-General pointed to a range of elements that are relevant to a renewed social contract, including inequality and corruption, yet underlines one essential dimension: justice. He drew particular attention to the importance of SDG 16 and the need to promote the rule of law and access to justice for all. The extended Management Plan for 2022 and 2023 reaffirms OHCHR's commitment to sup - port accountability for violations in the context of law enforcement, in line with the Four-Point Agenda to Achieve Transformative Change for Racial Justice and Equality. We will pursue our efforts to increase access to justice for those experiencing discrimination. We will also work actively with partners to advance accountability for violations of economic, social and cultural rights and gender-related crimes. For 2022 and 2023, we continue to work with partners so that: LAWS, POLICIES AND PRACTICES INCREASINGLY ADDRESS, PREVENT AND REDUCE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUSTICE SYSTEMS We remain committed to advocating, including through amicus briefs and trial monitoring, for administration of justice systems that comply with international human rights law. We also remain committed to strengthening institutional policy frameworks and accountability mecha - nisms to increase human rights protection in the context of law enforcement, specifically with regard to deprivation of liberty, use of force, and prevention of torture and ill-treatment, taking into account the lived experiences of specific groups such as people of African descent. We will continue to undertake strategic advocacy and develop partnerships to promote abolition 37 THE PILLARS OF OUR PROGRAMMEof the death penalty; pending its abolition, we will promote moratoria and increased adherence to international human rights law. Through research, technical support and advocacy, we will address the human rights implications of responses to transnational crimes, such as drug crimes, terrorism, and human trafficking. STRENGTHENED NATIONAL MECHANISMS PROVIDE REDRESS TO VICTIMS AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, INCLUDING OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHTS We will continue to: support actions to strengthen independent judicial authorities and oversight mechanisms, and legal aid and witness pro - tection programmes; train judicial institutions and administrative authorities; advocate for the establishment of individual complaint mecha - nisms in national human rights institutions and for independent mechanisms to support families of individuals who allege their human rights have been violated by law enforcement; and pro - mote ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. We remain focused on helping civil society and independent monitoring bod - ies to seek justice in cases relating to economic, social and cultural rights. JUSTICE SYSTEMS INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE GENDER-RELATED CRIMES MORE EFFECTIVELY We will extend our efforts to assist judicial officials to improve their understanding of inter - national standards on gender-based crimes, and their capacity to investigate and prosecute such crimes and implement reparation programmes. To complement this approach, we encourage the adoption of gender-sensitive procedures to enhance the participation of victims in justice processes. We will continue to prioritize support for the investigation and reporting of such crimes, as well as strategic litigation before national and regional courts. We will also continue to prior - itize efforts to build civil society's capacity to advocate for accountability for gender-related crimes, and support the development, promotion and application of normative guidance.STATES TAKE MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THEIR DECISION-MAKING, POLICIES AND ACTIONS ARE MORE TRANSPARENT; THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO INFORMATION FOR ACCOUNTABILITY PURPOSES We will continue to: undertake research, pol - icy development and strategic communications to increase understanding of the importance of transparency and access to information as components of accountability; strengthen the capacity of national human rights institutions and oversight bodies to adjudicate and enforce transparency and freedom of information standards; and work within the UN System to reinforce its policies in this area. UN EFFORTS FOR THE RULE OF LAW, JUSTICE, COUNTER-TERRORISM AND ACCOUNTABILITY PUT HUMAN RIGHTS AT THE CORE We renew our support to UN programmes that strengthen countries' rule of law systems, including through law reform and support to justice and security policies and institutions, in particular to ensure that they are anchored in human rights laws. We continue to contribute to the development of policies and guidance for human rights and justice mechanisms that United Nations intergovernmental bodies estab - lish to collect, analyse and preserve evidence for use in judicial processes. We remain focused on assisting the Office of Counter-Terrorism to integrate human rights, including gender perspectives, in its policies and programmes. We also remain focused on increasing part - nerships and developing practical guidance on human rights and drug policies. Further, we will continue to reinforce UN accountability mech - anisms, including mechanisms and processes to prevent and address violations committed by or attributed to staff members. 38 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023Pillar Results: Strengthen the rule of law and accountability for human rights violations THE SPECIFIC PILLAR RESULTS WE CONTRIBUTE TO SHIFTS A AccountabilityA1Laws, policies and practices increasingly address, prevent and reduce human rights violations in the context of law enforcement and justice systems.Prevention | Frontier issues: Corruption, people on the move | SDG 16 A2Strengthened national mechanisms provide redress to victims and accountability for human rights violations, including for economic and social rights.Prevention | Global Constituency | Civic Space | Leveraging Data | Frontier issues: Climate, corruption, people on the move | SDG 16 A3Justice systems investigate and prosecute gender-related crimes more effectively.Prevention | Global Constituency | Frontier issue: Corruption | SDG 5, 16 A4States take measures to ensure that their decision-making, policies and actions are more transparent and the public has access to information for accountability purposes.Global Constituency | Frontier issues: Corruption, people on the move | SDG 16 A5UN efforts for the rule of law, justice, counterterrorism and accountability put human rights at the core.Prevention | Global Constituency | Inequalities | SDG 16 D1Judicial and non-judicial mechanisms hold business and other economic actors to account for rights abuses and provide remedies to victims.Prevention | Civic Space | Inequalities | Frontier issues: Climate change, digital space | SDG 12, 16 PS2Efforts to counter terrorism and prevent violent extremism comply with international law.Prevention | SDG 16 PS4Justice mechanisms, including for transitional justice, provide increased accountability for conflict-related violations.Prevention | Civic Space | Inequalities | SDG 16 PS6United Nations' support to national and regional security forces, law enforcement agencies, and non-State actors integrates human rights and complies with the HRDDP.Prevention | Global Constituency | SDG 16 P7Public recognition that human rights and accountability make important contributions to effective responses to violence, including terrorism and violent extremism, increases.Prevention | Global Constituency | Civic Space | Inequalities | Frontier issues: people on the move | SDG 139 SHIFTS ACROSS OUR PILLARS TO INCREASE OUR RELEVANCEShifts across our pillars to increase our relevance OHCHR shifts are more focused thematic human rights challenges that are addressed within each pillar . One of the shifts is composed of four Frontier issues . Frontier issues are emerging concerns selected by OHCHR because their impact on human rights needs to be better understood. Inequality Upholding human rights will greatly reduce inequalities of all kinds. Mounting economic and social inequalities, fuelled by regressive eco - nomic models and a generation of underfunding of public services, underscore the urgent need to curb discrimination and expand fiscal space to increase investment in essential social services. The response to Covid-19, Leave No One Behind, and OHCHR's Surge Initiative are mutually-re - inforcing work areas that place human rights at the centre of economic policymaking and focus on protecting and increasing the mean - ingful participation of marginalized groups, strengthening the fulfilment of economic and social rights, and creating conditions in which inequalities can be reduced. The immediate aim of the shift on inequality is to support building back better; Our Common Agenda states that destabilizing inequalities must be overcome to realize humanity's hopes of breaking through to a greener, better, safer future. Global constituency for human rights \u00a9 EPA-EFE In Our Common Agenda , the Secretary-General says that trust is the foundation of a renewed social contract anchored in human rights. Trust in people, institutions and society prospers where human rights are protected, respected and fulfilled. Trust springs from listening to and speaking with diverse constituencies, and in particular from dialogues that promote under - standing of human rights and demonstrate their tangible contributions to sustainable develop - ment, peace and security and the everyday lives of individuals. OHCHR is committed to cultivating a global constituency that will not only stand up for the promise of human rights, but participate in defining our renewed social contract. 40 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023Leveraging data for human rights The data revolution has the potential to improve human rights analysis and monitoring and strengthen support for sustainable development and prevention efforts. As a producer, recipient and user of massive amounts of human rights data, OHCHR can lead data-driven advocacy across the UN and contribute to international, regional and national action to protect and advance human rights through better collec - tion, analysis and dissemination of data on human rights issues and situations. In addition, such data can support the call in Our Common Agenda for evidence and fact-based science and knowledge, which are essential to end the 'infodemic' that plagues our world. OHCHR can also guide the efforts of States and the UN System to ensure that data collection and man - agement fully respect human rights principles and standards, thereby mitigating the possible negative impacts of the data revolution on rights, including privacy and security.Protect and expand civic space \u00a9 Chris Slupski on Unsplash Public participation, freedom of expression, access to information, freedoms of association and assembly: these and other dimensions of civil society and civic space ensure that human - ity, individually and collectively, can stand up for all human rights everywhere. They also intertwine to support the three foundations for a renewed social contract described in Our Common Agenda : (a) trust; (b) inclusion, pro - tection and participation; and (c) measuring and valuing what matters to people and the planet. OHCHR's efforts to protect and expand civic space remain constant, informed by Our Common Agenda and OHCHR's responsibili - ties as custodian of SDG Indicator 16.10.1. 41 SHIFTS ACROSS OUR PILLARS TO INCREASE OUR RELEVANCEPrevention of conflict, violence and insecurity The Secretary-General has called the interna - tional human rights system the 'best prevention tool we have' and a 'critical foundation' for sus - taining peace. OHCHR will continue to deliver human rights information for early warning and risk analysis, demonstrate how respect for human rights contributes to conflict prevention, and build a culture of prevention that is informed by human rights, in particular through the rec - ommendations of human rights mechanisms. Frontier issue: Climate change \u00a9 Markus Spiske on Unsplash The impacts of climate change on human rights are underlined in the 2030 Agenda and prioritized by the Secretary-General in Our Common Agenda and the Call to Action for Human Rights . Climate change is increasingly central to OHCHR's work. Beyond threats to rights to water and sanitation, housing, food, health and development, the rise in attacks against environmental human rights defenders demands swift and comprehensive protection measures. In addition, human rights-based approaches to climate change have the potential to increase resilience, and strengthen crisis preparedness and contingency planning. Frontier issue: Corruption \u00a9 REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi Difficulties in acquiring, distributing and accessing Covid-19 vaccines have confirmed the corrosive effects of corruption on human rights. Similar effects undermine confidence in governance, judiciaries and electoral sys - tems and access to health, education, water and sanitation and other basic services. Our Common Agenda noted that the decay in trust undermines the social contract, but also that corruption has a disproportionate impact on women. Consistently raised as a concern by the human rights mechanisms, ending corruption is a pre-condition of the enjoyment, by all, of all human rights. 42 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023Frontier issue: Digital space and emerging technologies \u00a9 Giu Vicente on Unsplash The global pandemic has redirected much human interaction to the digital space and increased our reliance on emerging technol - ogies. Their potential for positive change and their extraordinary reach continue to astound humanity. Nevertheless, core concerns remain, about artificial intelligence, threats to privacy and freedom of expression, and the dangers posed by surveillance, hate speech, discrimi - nation, violence and exploitation (including of children) and sexual violence. Our Common Agenda calls for concerted efforts to improve digital cooperation, including through a Global Digital Compact. OHCHR will initially assist technology companies and others to apply the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to the digital space and emerging technologies. Frontier issue: People on the move To deliver on Agenda 2030's guiding principle to Leave No One Behind, it will be necessary to protect the human rights of all migrants more effectively, irrespective of where they are or how or why they are on they move. The need to ensure that migrants can access Covid-19 treat - ments and vaccines underlines the urgency of the challenge. OHCHR continues to work to sup - port implementation of the commitments made in the Global Compact on Migration.43 SHINING A SPOTLIGHT ON WOMEN, YOUNG PEOPLE, PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENTShining a spotlight on women, young people, persons with disabilities and people of African descent In addition to maintaining its commitment to com - bat discrimination on any and all grounds, OHCHR's Spotlight populations focus on the human rights of par - ticular groups and contributes to Agenda 2030's guiding principle of Leave No One Behind. Persons with disabilities Persons with disabilities continue to experience high levels of discrimination in a wide range of settings, notably in their access to employ - ment, access to health and education services, and participation in public life. The launch of the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy and OHCHR's Disability Strategy indicators and targets for 2022-2023 are initial elements of a response. OHCHR will continue to work actively for the effective promotion and protec - tion of the rights of persons with disabilities. Women The global pandemic imperils progress on gender inequality. Women comprise 70% of the health workforce and are more likely to be frontline health workers. They experience higher levels of violence, especially in the con - text of lockdowns, are more likely to lose their jobs, and do more unpaid labour. These impacts Women react after Colombia's constitutional court voted to decriminalize abortion in Bogota, Colombia, February 2022. \u00a9 REUTERS/Luisa Gonzalez44 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023compound the discrimination and violence that already affected women. In this new context, women's rights must be re-prioritized, and a new commitment made at global, regional, national and local level to respect, protect and fulfil all rights for all women. Young people Our Common Agenda puts young people at the centre of humanity's choice to breakdown or breakthrough. They stand at the nexus of solidarity: the generation that is most directly affected by today's decisions is most obviously in solidarity with future generations, because it will be responsible for bequeathing a liveable world to those who follow. While young people are a source of immense hope and potential, as constructive agents of change for human rights, today they experience many challenges to enjoy - ment of their human rights. This is especially true of those whose lives are marked by pov - erty, discrimination, violence, lack of education, or lack of opportunities. By listening to young people and developing their understanding of human rights, OHCHR works to ensure that young people everywhere enjoy and stand up for human rights - now and in the future. People of African descent The High Commissioner's leadership role in implementing the Four-Point Agenda Towards Transformative Change for Racial Justice and Equality requires that OHCHR build on its longstanding work to combat the racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intoler - ance faced by people of African descent. This responds not only to global demands to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of people of African descent but to essential commitments made in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. In 2022, two new mechanisms - the international independent expert mechanism to advance racial justice and equality in law enforce - ment, and the Permanent Forum on People of African descent - will further strengthen the UN's human rights anti-racism architecture, which includes the Working Group of Experts on People of African descent, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and the Special Rapporteur on Contemporary forms of Racism, supported by the International Decade for People of African descent. \u00ab I want to live \u00bb. Photo taken during a Black Lives matter protest in Paris. \u00a9 Thomas de LUZE on Unsplash45 ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS ACTION PLANSOrganizational Effectiveness Action Plans OHCHR's commitment to continuous internal improvement is articulated in its Organizational Effectiveness Action Plans (OEAPs). OEAPs support increased efficiency and effectiveness in programme delivery. They also support OHCHR's commitment to provide an inclusive, innovative and inspiring working environment in which all those who work for OHCHR can grow and contribute the maximum of their potential, thereby ensuring that the entire organization achieves the highest standards of performance and results. The High Commissioner's extended Management Plan for 2022 and 2023 updates existing OEAPs to match today's context. An OEAP on Diversity and Inclusion (replacing the former OEAP on Diversity and Gender) addresses the intersectionality of gender, race and other forms of diversity and focuses partic - ularly on inclusion and belonging. Installation of solar panels at OHCHR's Regional Office for Central America in Panama. \u00a9 OHCHR The Plan also adds two OEAPs, on digital technology and on sustainable environmental management, which will assist OHCHR to con - tribute to recovering better for the future. In 2022 and 2023, UN Human Rights will work to ensure that: Digital technology UN Human Rights maximizes its potential and scales up its impact by fully integrating its technology stack and digital services in efforts to advance its mandate We apply digital technology as a platform to improve organizational effectiveness and human rights impact. We confront challenges to the creation of an enabling environment for Office- wide technology development, uptake, use and interoperability, including in mandates and field presences. We make proposals and find solutions 46 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023to further connect our systems; use agile delivery methods; make sure our tools are fully employed; close cybersecurity protection gaps; and ensure that staff have the digital skill set they need. We explore, adopt and adapt new technologies to support human rights work across our mandate. Dynamic knowledge The Office is at the forefront of using knowl - edge to effect change. It is recognized for this and is a source of information that people come to. The office uses its resources strate - gically and sets evidence-based priorities for country and other engagements. We remain focused on creating, sharing and applying knowledge that adds value and leverage to our efforts to achieve human rights outcomes. To this end, we aim to fully implement a knowl - edge and information management strategy that builds on the advances we have made in infor - mation systems and data collection through the Universal Human Rights Index, Human Rights Case Database, Performance Monitoring System and Rights View project. Internally, a new intranet with an integrated knowledge hub will be created and OHCHR will adopt new methodologies and innovative ways of work - ing to support and facilitate changes in how we operate. We aim to consolidate innovations made during the pandemic, which have strength - ened our flexibility, adaptability and outreach and our ability to fulfil our mandate. External communications OHCHR's human rights impacts and key messages are effectively communicated, helping position the Office as the global stan - dard-bearer of human rights. We continue to organize our communications to enhance our visibility, advocacy, mobilization and education. We will further consolidate our com - munication capacity away from Headquarters and in New York, and in social media, audio-vi - sual media and translation. On the basis of UN Human Rights' renewed branding, we under - take to communicate more clearly to broader audiences, notably through understanding their expectations better and refining our communi - cation tools, platforms and messages so that we can 'tell our story' in a manner that generates additional public and financial support. Diversity and inclusion OHCHR's culture and workforce are more diverse and inclusive. Staff are treated with equality, dignity and respect. Decision-making is more informed by data. Accountability measures are better established. We have renewed and will strengthen our efforts to achieve a more inclusive and diverse UN Human Rights, that ensures all staff feel equally that they belong, regardless of their identity, duty station, grade or function. We will identify and address gaps, imbalances and barriers to recruiting and appointing a diverse workforce at all levels. We will continue to cul - tivate an organizational culture that promotes safety, strengthens shared values and beliefs, and addresses harassment and discrimination. We will introduce data collection and accountability measures to monitor progress against specific diversity and inclusion indicators. \u00a9 Tim Mossholder on Unsplash47 ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS ACTION PLANSInnovation Across the Office, innovation is encour - aged and supported and its results are implemented. We reaffirm our desire to generate innovative ideas and foster their application, and in par - ticular develop breakthrough learning that adds value and creates leverage for change. We remain committed to establishing non-hierar - chical settings, offering creative incentives, and showcasing and celebrating innovative work through annual innovation challenges. We will seek to establish appropriate partnerships and use new technologies to advance human rights. We will examine how we engage externally and constantly strive to improve our internal work - ing methods. Managing talent OHCHR is actively unleashing the full potential of its staff by recognizing talent and making career management accessible to all. We remain committed to expanding and strengthening staff learning and career sup - port opportunities that will permit UN Human Rights to fulfil its mandate today and in the future. We also remain committed to enabling managers and leaders to lead more effectively, in particular by identifying and investing in support for leadership talent and aligning staff learning to Office priorities. We will build on steps that have already been taken to strengthen human resources management by simplifying procedures, providing more equitable working conditions for staff, enhancing resolution of complaints, and implementing a fast track pro - cedure for emergency deployment. Operations management OHCHR managers make the most efficient and responsible use of all available resources, supported by effective deployment of rele - vant technologies. We continue to focus on enhancing adminis - trative and programmatic support to the entire Office, focusing on field presences, strength - ening programme management functions, and ensuring that information technology tools and platforms are available to all staff members. We will continue to prioritize provision of accurate and timely information on income, budgeted expenditure, human resources, and travel, in particular taking account of our commitment to rigorously adhere to the UN's administrative system.

It continues to be a priority to strengthen our relations with Member States, especially in order to increase regular budget funding for UN Human Rights and deepen engagement with current and prospective donors. It is also a priority to broaden UN Human Rights' donor base among Member States and non-traditional actors, including by refining our approach to resource mobilization and reinforcing related skills and capacities. With this in mind, we continuously scan the horizon for innovative funding models and sharpen our communication and reporting on human rights impact. Strategic leadership and direction OHCHR is fit for purpose to deliver its mandate, having a strategic direction that responds to the changing global context, and inclusive and inspirational leaders who focus on results. The capacity to make, communicate and imple - ment timely strategic decisions is a precondition of effective functioning in any organization. We remain focused on decision-making that is informed by the results and lessons of past perfor - mance and guided by its impact on achievement of the organization's long-term goals. We will provide the strong strategic direction needed by a dynamic and vibrant organization that is responsive to the challenges and opportunities of today's political and financial environment, within and outside the UN. Sustainable environmental management OHCHR Headquarters, field presences and all staff members support effective sustainability, doing their part to support rights-based action for people and the planet. We will build on existing good practices, draw on good experiences and practices from elsewhere, and continue to evolve towards environmentally sustainable global operations. Our increasing focus on transitioning to more environmentally sustainable policies and prac - tices has led all planning entities to accept their responsibilities and make formal commitments to integrate elements of environmental sustain - ability in their work. These elements include transparency, accountability and adoption of a holistic, rights-based approach to sustainability, consistent with fulfilment of the human right to a healthy environment. This stance reinforces and underpins UN Human Rights' advocacy for rights-based environmental action aligned with the UN's sustainable development values. 49 EVALUATION AND RISK MANAGEMENTEvaluation and Risk Management Evaluation UN Human Rights has established an eval - uation function that is aligned with United Nations Norms and Standards for Evaluation, developed by the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG). The function is guided by an evaluation policy and plan that follow the UN Human Rights programming cycle. The goal is to increase the impact of UN Human Rights' interventions, and make them even more rele - vant, efficient, effective and sustainable. In the mid-term, UN Human Rights seeks three outcome-level results: 1. The evaluation function is a well-developed and well-used component of the results- based management approach that UN Human Rights applies. 2. On the basis of evidence provided by eval - uations, senior managers at UN Human Rights systematically review decisions on current and planned interventions and OHCHR's structures and processes. 3. UN Human Rights applies the evaluation resources of the UN System strategically to improve its relevance, efficiency, effective - ness, impact and sustainability. In 2022-2023, UN Human Rights will under - take at least two strategic thematic evaluations and five evaluations of particular areas of work (programmes or entities). A preliminary list includes: evaluations of UN Human Rights Country Programmes in Sudan, Ukraine, and Mozambique; assessments of the Regional Emergency Response to Covid-19 project and the Accountability in Iraq project; and evalu - ations of the Treaty Bodies' Capacity Building programme and the Annual Appeal/Report process. 50 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023Risk management Risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives. In the preceding Management Plan, UN Human Rights made risk management an integral com - ponent of programme management. As part of the overall risk management initiative of the UN Secretariat and in a wider effort to improve the Organization's governance and account - ability framework, a UN Human Rights Risk Management Plan was developed in 2020. This plan includes a UN Human Rights Risk Register. This exercise was timely because Covid-19 underscored that corporate processes needed to anticipate, assess and evaluate risks and put controls and systems in place to avoid and mitigate them. An Office-wide risk assessment process was organized to identify potential risks, root causes, drivers, existing internal controls and addi - tional risk response measures. It identified 16 main risks. High and very high risks included: budget allocation, public perception and repu - tation, extra-budgetary funding, regular budget funding, General Assembly and Member States, political climate (external and internal), unique events (for example, the pandemic), crisis and contingency management, the information tech - nology infrastructure, information technology security and access, information technology governance and cyber security, and Umoja requirements. Following the methodology of the United Nations Secretariat, risk owners have been assigned to the very high and high risks and tasked to design, implement and report on their Risk Treatment and Response plans. Information on all 16 risks, including their mitigation mea - sures, is compiled in a Risk Register, which will be reviewed regularly to monitor changes in risk profiles and identify risks that emerge. At the level of programmes, based on the Risk Register and assumptions identified when devel - oping different theories of change, OHCHR has named four types of risk category: strategic, environmental, operational, and financial. Risk management is monitored within programme performance monitoring, thereby strengthening the link between expected outcomes, results and evaluation. Having completed its Risk Register, UN Human Rights complies with the requirement of the UN Secretariat, heeding calls from Member States to establish a risk management plan. It enables the Office to anticipate and mitigate new risks and challenges better, and thereby fulfil its mandate more effectively. 51GLOBAL TARGETS FOR 2030 Global targets for 2023 1 The targets to be achieved by 2023 were adjusted from the 2018-2021 OMP, in particular where we have updated country and subregional programmes. 2 'Countries*' refers to countries in which the Office plans to undertake activities towards a planned result.

Human Rights Mechanisms Development Peace and Security Non-discrimination Accountability Participation55 ENGAGEMENT IN THE REGIONSEngagement in the regions UN Human Rights implements its work at national and regional levels. Its activities include the provision of advisory services, technical cooperation, and capacity building work with counterparts to strengthen protection systems and implement effective measures that contrib - ute to the realization of human rights. OHCHR prioritizes follow-up to recommendations issued by international human rights mechanisms, such as the treaty bodies and the Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review (UPR). One main purpose of these efforts is to strengthen the national human rights infrastructure, in particular by bolstering national human rights institutions (NHRIs), collaborating with civil society organizations, and establishing coor - dination mechanisms for integrated reporting and follow up by State institutions, NHRIs and civil society organizations. OHCHR also gives priority to establishing or reinforcing the capac - ity of accountability and justice mechanisms to undertake monitoring and investigate and secure redress for victims of human rights violations.OHCHR ensures that this work is carried out in line with national and regional development plans. It thereby enhances the ability of Member States, the UN System, development partners and civil society to address gaps in implementa - tion, revise legislation and practices to increase conformity with human rights norms, and con - tribute to implementation of the 2030 Agenda. OHCHR operates through 103 field presences constituting either stand-alone offices or col - laborative arrangements. Stand-alone offices are country and regional offices under the direct supervision of OHCHR. Collaborative arrangements are field presences that have dou - ble reporting lines. Human rights components of peace and political missions report to the Head of the mission and the High Commissioner; human rights advisers (HRAs) report to UN Resident Coordinators (RC) and the High Commissioner. 56 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023AFRICA INTRODUCTION commission of human rights experts established by the Human Rights Council in December 2021 to conduct a thorough and impartial inves - tigation into allegations of violations and abuses committed in Ethiopia since November 2020 by all parties to the conflict. The OHCHR Africa programme contributes to mainstreaming inter - national human rights standards at regional and sub-regional level, including through its partner - ship with the African Union and the Regional Economic Communities, as well as the African human rights machinery and institutions. As part of these efforts, on 11 November 2019, the High Commissioner and the Executive Secretary of International Conference on the Great Lakes Region signed in Nairobi a Memorandum of Understanding between the two organizations. In its efforts to promote and protect human rights in the Great Lakes Region, OHCHR has worked closely with the Nairobi-based Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region of Africa.The OHCHR Africa programme covers 49 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The presences include four regional offices in East Africa, Southern Africa, West Africa, and Central Africa; eight country offices/programmes in Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Niger, Sudan and Uganda; 16 HRAs in the UNCTs of Burundi, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Zambia and Zimbabwe; and six human rights presences in UN peace missions, in the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mali, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan. The Africa programme further sup - ports five special procedures country mandates, in Somalia, Eritrea, Mali, CAR and Burundi, the Commission on Human Rights on South Sudan, the team of international human rights experts on the situation in DRC, and the man - date of the Designated Expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan. In addition, the Africa programme will support the international CURRENT HUMAN RIGHTS CONTEXT Civic space and democratic transition. Civic space was severely restricted in a range of contexts, including in contested electoral processes and political impasses where polit - ical opponents, media workers, human rights defenders and civil society representatives were targeted and experienced violations of civil and political rights. Incidents included arbitrary arrests and detention, excessive use of force, prohibition of demonstrations under the pretext of ensuring security, blan - ket internet shutdowns, raids of offices of civil society organizations and media outlets, and allegations of torture and ill-treatment of political opponents, journalists, and human rights defenders. Unconstitutional changes of Government occurred, challenging the rule of law and the operations of democratic institutions; some countries experienced peaceful democratic transitions. Violations of human rights in situations of conflict, violence and insecurity. Africa con - tinued to experience violence and insecurity, including serious violations of women's rights, in the context of protracted armed conflicts. In certain countries, intercommunal vio - lence, clashes, and incidents of extrajudicial, arbitrary and summary executions, enforced disappearances, kidnapping, rape, torture, and arbitrary arrest and detention were reported. The conflict in the Tigray region of Ethiopia resulted in serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law committed by all parties to the conflict, some of which may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. 57 ENGAGEMENT IN THE REGIONS | AFRICA Rise of violent extremism. Violent extremism in the Sahel, the Lake Chad Basin as well as in northern Mozambique is a major security concern. Violent extremist groups continue to be a threat in DRC, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger and Nigeria and have expanded their territorial control and activities in countries such as Mali and Mozambique. Incidents of violence included suicide bomb - ings, improvised explosive device attacks, kidnappings, arson attacks, raids and attacks on villages and educational institutions and on humanitarian and health personnel and facilities, looting, cattle rustling, extortion, and ambushes on military positions, as well as sexual violence against civilians includ - ing cases of forced marriage of women and girls by members of violent extremist groups. Violent extremist groups have imposed so-called \"peace agreements\" on several communities living in areas where State con - trol is absent. Many of these agreements are inconsistent with human rights norms and standards, particularly the human rights of women and girls. Chronic impunity and lack of accountability are some of the factors that contribute to violent extremism. Impunity. In many countries, few credi - ble investigations or prosecutions of grave human rights violations have taken place. On a positive note, CAR took some steps to address impunity, by operationalizing a Special Criminal Court to ensure that perpe - trators of human rights violations are tried for outstanding crimes, including hundreds of sexual violence cases. The CAR Government also made efforts to move forward on tran - sitional justice initiatives. These included launching a truth commission, identifying collective reparations, and undertaking insti - tutional reforms to prevent the recurrence of conflict. In DRC, significant efforts are being made in the fight against impunity, despite the fragile security context in the eastern provinces. In South Sudan, the Government's engage - ment with respect to the establishment of the Hybrid Court for South Sudan has remained limited and the Memorandum of Understanding with the African Union for the establishment of the Court has not yet been signed. In Ethiopia, OHCHR and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission conducted a joint investigation into alleged human rights violations, and abuses and violations of international humanitarian and refugee law, that have been committed by all parties to the conflict in the Tigray region, and the Government has established an inter-ministerial task force to implement some of the report's recommendations. Violations of the rights of people on the move. Thousands of Africans have died in the Sahara and the Mediterranean Sea while attempting to reach Europe. The factors that have caused Africans to migrate included seri - ous political and security challenges in many African countries, and poor socioeconomic conditions and policies that compelled people to flee, such as indefinite and compulsory mil - itary service in Eritrea. In some cases, these were exacerbated by austerity measures that governments adopted to manage the impact of falling oil prices on tax revenue. Violations of economic, social and cultural rights. The African continent continued to experience rapid economic and social change, and the Covid-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on economic growth. The pandemic further exacerbated large wealth discrepancies between countries and within societies; in a context of shrinking fiscal space, many countries faced ever increasing challenges to implement their obligations to respect, protect and/or fulfil economic, social and cultural rights, or provide social protection. The Covid-19 pandemic reversed some of the progress that had been made to enhance access to social, economic and cul - tural rights. Lack of fulfilment of these rights is associated with extreme poverty, discrim - ination, climate change and environmental degradation, rapid population growth, weak governance, imperfect rule of law, insecurity, and threats to national and regional stabil - ity posed by armed conflict. These reverses have made populations more vulnerable and have reduced their access to employment, 58 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023education, health, social security, food, hous - ing, water and other basic necessities. Gender-based violence. SGBV continued to be reported. In countries in conflict, large-scale sexual violence was commonly used during attacks against the civilian populations. In other countries, female genital mutila - tion, forced and early marriage, and SGBV remained rooted in harmful traditional prac - tices. Few SGBV cases have been prosecuted, due to serious deficiencies in national judicial systems and law enforcement agencies, com - pounded by the absence of laws prohibiting gender-based violence, the stigma associated with SGBV, which is partly responsible for under-reporting, and the lack of well-func - tioning and funded programmes to support survivors' efforts to claim their rights (such as victim/witness protection and legal assistance programmes).59 ENGAGEMENT IN THE REGIONS | AFRICAAfrica and the United Nations human rights mechanisms Ratification, reporting and standing invitation (baseline December Procedure mandate holders Angola X (Nov 2019) No Benin X X X (Nov 2017) Yes (2012) Botswana X X X (Jan 2018) Yes (2018) Burkina Faso X X X X X (May 2018) No Burundi X X X X X X X (Jan 2018) Yes (2013) Cameroon X X (May 2018) Yes (2014) Cape Verde X X X X X (May 2018) Yes (2013) Central African Rep.

It provides consultative services and technical assistance on regional and international human rights norms to the Government of Chad and other partners. The scaling-up of the country office in Chad in 2019 has enabled OHCHR to: strengthen its capacity to provide advisory services to the Government and technical assistance to national institutions; support national human rights protection and promotion mechanisms, including the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC); foster an enhanced human rights environment through the continued provision of independent monitoring and reporting on the human rights situation; and identify strategies to address human rights issues relating to movement of people, drugs, and arms linked to terrorist activities. An OHCHR Group of Five Sahel (G5 Sahel) Joint Force team has been embedded in the country office since 2019, based in N'Djamena, to support implementation of the compliance framework of the G5 Sahel Joint Force (FC-G5S). This step enables OHCHR to increase the value of its partnership with the FC-G5S by addressing protection concerns and promoting human rights in support of long-term peace and security. ENGAGEMENT WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS The Government has recently made serious efforts to cooperate with international mechanisms. It has submitted its UPR report and several reports to treaty bodies, namely CERD, CEDAW, CAT and CRC. Ratifications of the CRPD and the ICRMW are anticipated.

In 2017, the countries decided to establish the FC-G5S to respond to the expansion of armed and violent extremist groups and to the deteriorating security situation in the region. In its Resolution 2391 (2017), the UN Security Council called on the G5 Sahel States to \"establish a robust compliance framework to prevent, investigate, address and publicly report violations and abuses of human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law related to the FC-G5S\". Since 2018, OHCHR has supported the G5 Sahel Joint Force in progressively developing and imple - menting a Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Compliance Framework. The team, which is spread across eight duty stations, is implementing the project in close coordination with the wide range of technical partners that support the Joint Force. The Joint Force is the first sub-regional security force that has committed to implementing such a framework, which translates international and regional human rights and international humanitarian law obligations into specific measures and mechanisms that are operationally relevant and practical at military tactical level. By placing human rights and the protection of civilians at the heart of its military operations, the Compliance Framework allows the FC-G5S to better achieve its military objectives, including by gaining the confidence and trust of the civilian populations it is mandated to protect. OHCHR's specialized skills and expertise, its ongoing dialogue with military partners, and sustained advocacy to build and maintain national and regional ownership of the Compliance Framework and the political support of other stakeholders, such as Security Council members, have contributed to the progress achieved so far. Working jointly with other partners, OHCHR has supported the G5 Sahel Joint Force to: integrate human rights and humanitarian law standards in its foundational doctrine, procedures and mechanisms; strengthen the Force's internal conduct and discipline capac - ity, including by supporting the establishment of a Police Component; and establish an internal Casualty and Incident Tracking and Analysis Cell, that enables the Force to attribute responsibility for incidents, analyse patterns, take necessary remedial action, revise its doctrine, and adapt its operational conduct. Provision of support to the G5 Sahel Joint Force is part of OHCHR's broader Sahel strategy, which is designed to improve respect for human rights in the region. The strengthening of OHCHR's engagement, especially via its presences in the five countries, enhances OHCHR's ability to engage with security forces in the region.

The regional presences include the Office for South America (ROSA), based in Chile; and the Office for Central America, the Dominican Republic and English-speaking Caribbean region (ROCA), based in Panama. In addition, there are four country offices, in Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico and Honduras; one human rights component in the peace CURRENT HUMAN RIGHTS CONTEXT With notable exceptions, the countries of the Americas region have robust legal and institu - tional frameworks, NHRIs, strong civil society networks, and the highest level of treaty rati - fication. In general, Member States have good cooperation with OHCHR and engage actively with the UN human rights mechanisms, includ - ing with the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms and special procedures. OHCHR's early warning, monitoring and reporting mandate has enabled it to identify and assess protection gaps and shortcomings in the Americas. The region displays some of the highest levels of socio-economic inequality in the world and the Covid-19 pandemic is dis - proportionately affecting groups in vulnerable situations, including women, indigenous peo - ples, Afro-descendants, people living in poverty, persons deprived of their liberty, LGBTI per - sons, and migrants, among others. OHCHR's priorities in the region include strengthening accountability systems; improv - ing access to justice and reparations for victims of gross human rights violations; combating discrimination; reducing inequalities; widening civic space; supporting technical cooperation and institution building; and facilitating dialogue, early warning, and prevention and protection of human rights in situations of conflict and inse - curity, including during electoral processes. The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the need mission in Haiti; 14 HRAs to UN RCs and UNCTs, in Argentina, Bolivia, Belize, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guyana, Jamaica, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Paraguay, Uruguay; and three technical missions in Bolivia, El Salvador and Venezuela. Engagement with Canada, Cuba and the United States conducted from Headquarters. to create and strengthen existing structures to guarantee economic, social and cultural rights, including by fostering strategies and enhanc - ing advocacy. The capacities of OHCHR field presences to support CCA/UNSDCF processes and socio-economic response plans, as well as engagement on economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development, will con - tinue to be enhanced by the contributions of an economist (deployed in Chile) and a human rights officer with expertise on the SDGs (deployed in Panama). The establishment of a regional adviser post on racism should enhance work on discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities. Subject to the availability of funding, it is planned to strengthen expertise on priority thematic issues, such as migration, gender, and human rights and the environment. The main trends are: Shrinking democratic space. During 2019, social unrest erupted across the region, reflecting a widening gap between popu - lar expectations and economic and social realities. Polarization, frustration with polit - ical leadership, and acts of repression, have increased pressures on democratic space. More regulations have been adopted that restrict the rights to freedom of expression, participation, peaceful assembly and associ - ation. Repressive laws have been spreading throughout the region, and civil society 118 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023organizations have faced restrictions on registration and their operations. New tech - nologies have helped civil society networks to grow, but they have also been used to control civil society activities and media freedoms, often on the basis of security justifications. In a number of countries of the region, media freedom is seriously restricted and fundamen - tal freedoms are violently repressed. Human rights defenders and journalists. Latin America is considered one of the most dangerous regions in the world for human rights defenders (HRDs), who continue to be threatened by harassment, stigmatizing narratives, unsubstantiated prosecutions, arbitrary detention, and attacks on their life and physical integrity, with almost complete impunity. The HRDs most at risk include environmental and land rights defenders, members of indigenous peoples or traditional communities, peasants, LGBTI persons, and persons of African descent. The protection mechanisms that some countries have estab - lished have not been effective in countering these trends. Poverty, inequality and discrimination. Important shortcomings in the realization of economic, social and cultural rights have affected groups subject to discrimination and reinforced inequality. Falling rates of eco - nomic growth and austerity measures have exacerbated the situation, causing social protests that the authorities have often met with repression. Indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants are among those most affected by structural political, economic, social, environmental and health inequali - ties. Development projects and the growth of extractive industries have further affected the rights of indigenous peoples and tradi - tional communities. Racial discrimination remains a significant barrier to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and to political participation by all. The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated long-term inequal - ities in the Latin America and Caribbean region . Due to structural inequalities and discrimination, groups in vulnerable situa - tions are less likely to be vaccinated. This is particularly a risk for populations living in remote rural areas, indigenous peoples, tradi - tional Afro-descendant communities, persons living in poverty, persons with disabili - ties, migrants, particularly undocumented migrants, persons deprived of liberty, and others experiencing marginalisation. Lack of policies that guarantee access to vaccines in rural areas, inadequate participation by and consultation with communities, the require - ment for identification documents, and the digital divide, all contribute to a vaccina - tion deficit among these groups. In virtually all countries, the absence of disaggregated information on groups in vulnerable situa - tions significantly complicates attempts on make a human rights analysis of Covid-19 vaccination data. In some countries, official information about the spread of the Covid- 19 pandemic has lacked transparency and credibility. In several countries, populations protested, angered by vaccine shortages or perceptions that Governments had spent public funds corruptly in the course of com - batting Covid-19. During the pandemic, Latin America and the Caribbean have closed schools for longer than any other region. Widespread violence and insecurity. In a number of countries, Governments continued to adopt security approaches that fall short of human rights standards, militarized public security, introduced criminal laws that under - mined due process and fair trial guarantees, applied tough anti-terrorist laws, employed private security companies without appropri - ate oversight, or increased levels of pre-trial incarceration. Impunity and transitional justice. Structural problems in administration and access to justice, which particularly affect indigenous peoples and women, continue to impede the realization of human rights in the Americas. There have been important steps to advance the right to truth, justice, reparation for vic - tims and non-repetition of violations, in a region that has a legacy of armed conflicts and authoritarian regimes. Yet major obsta - cles persist. Some countries have made little progress or even regressed, for example by 119 ENGAGEMENT IN THE REGIONS | AMERICASrenewing attempts to pass amnesty laws. Judicial independence is under attack in a number of countries, amid patterns of corruption, lack of resources and the polit - icization of the judiciary. Efforts to combat corruption through national processes or UN/OAS-backed mechanisms have experi - enced setbacks in recent years as well as some progress. Gender, women and LGBTI. A number of countries have strengthened legal and insti - tutional frameworks to protect the rights of women and LGBTI persons. Nevertheless, violence against women, including gen - der-related killings, remains widespread. Discriminatory socio-cultural patterns per - sist, including negative gender stereotypes, limiting access to justice, health, education and work, among other human rights. The civic space of women and LGBTI human rights defenders is at risk, notably in the con - text of Covid-19. These defenders have been subject to online and off-line attacks when they have raised human rights concerns and expressed dissent at the absence of effec - tive policies to overcome the sanitary crisis. Threats and attacks against women defenders persist. Opposition to women's and LGBTI rights, and efforts to seriously restrict gender equality and sexual and reproductive rights have also increased, supported by conser - vative and religious fundamentalist groups. Femicide rates in the region continued to be among the highest in the world. Migration. The Americas are experiencing the largest migration flow in recent history. Humanitarian actors estimated that 5.9 mil - lion Venezuelans had left by September 2021 and more than six million were expected to have left by the end of the year. Due to persistently high levels of poverty, inequal - ity, violence and political instability, coupled with environmental disasters and climate change, the whole region is also experiencing a migration emergency, marked by a historic movement of migrants from Central America, Mexico, Cuba and Haiti towards the north and the southern border of the United States. In this context, the main human rights challenges and issues of concern have been the increase in returns at borders, and the detention and deportation of migrants. As borders were closed in response to the Covid- 19 pandemic and the number of people on the move rose, due to structural crises in some countries, migration routes changed, mak - ing migrants more vulnerable to violence, exploitation and other human rights viola - tions at borders and in transit. The limited capacity of States in the region to respond meant that the humanitarian needs of the migrant population have mainly been met by civil society organizations and the UN System. This is a matter of concern, owing to limited capacities. 120 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023Americas and the United Nations human rights mechanisms Ratifications, reporting and standing invitations (baseline mandate holders Antigua & Barbuda X X X X Nov 2021 No Argentina X Nov 2017 Yes (2002) Bahamas X X X X X X Jan 2018 Yes (2013) Barbados X X X X Jan 2018 No Belize X X X X X X X X X X Nov 2018 No Bolivia (Plurinational State of)X X Nov 2019 Yes (2010) Brazil May 2017 Yes (2001) Canada X X X X May 2018 Yes (1999) Chile X Jan 2019 Yes (2009) Colombia X May 2018 Yes (2003) Costa Rica X X May 2019 Yes (2002) Cuba X May 2018 No Dominica X X X X X X X May 2019 Yes (2009) Dominican Republic X X X X X X Jan 2019 No Ecuador May 2017 Yes (2003) El Salvador Nov 2019 Yes (2010) Grenada X X X X X X Jan 2020 No Guatemala Nov 2017 Yes (2001) Guyana X X X X X X Jan 2020 No Haiti X X X X Jan 2022 No Honduras X Nov 2020 Yes (2010) Jamaica X X X X X Nov 2020 No Mexico X Nov 2018 Yes (2001) Nicaragua X X May 2019 Yes (2006) Panama X X Nov 2020 Yes (2011) Paraguay X X X X X May 2021 Yes (2003) Peru Nov 2017 Yes (2002)121 ENGAGEMENT IN THE REGIONS | AMERICASAmericas and the United Nations human rights mechanisms Ratifications, reporting and standing invitations (baseline Special Procedure mandate holders St Kitts & Nevis X X X Jan 2021 No Saint Lucia X X X X X Jan 2021 Yes (2016) St Vincent & the GrenadinesX X X X X X X X Nov 2021 No Suriname X X X X Nov 2021 No Trinidad & Tobago X X X X Nov 2021 No Uruguay X X Jan 2019 Yes (2005) USA Nov 2020 Yes (2021) Venezuela (Boliviaran Republic of)X X X X Jan 2022 No XTreaty ratified Overdue report as of December 2021 Outstanding ratification122 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023BOLIVIA FIELD PRESENCE At the end of 2019, in the framework of the Peacebuilding Initiative launched by the UN System and the Secretary-General, the UN Human Rights Office deployed a Technical Mission to Bolivia.

However, OHCHR has a limited footprint in the region: a Regional Office for South-East Asia is based in Bangkok; a Regional Office for the Pacific is located in Suva; an office in Seoul oper - ates under a specific mandate in relation to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK); an Office in Cambodia operates on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Cambodia; and a Regional Office for the Pacific is located in Suva. In addition, a human rights unit is part of the UN Integrated Mission in Afghanistan, led by the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA). The UN Sustainable Development Group and OHCHR have deployed HRAs to RC Offices and UNCTs in Bangladesh, Maldives, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Timor-Leste. OHCHR also supports the work of national officers based in the RC Offices in Mongolia and Nepal. The Human Rights Council has mandated country specific special procedure mandates to work on Afghanistan, Cambodia, DPRK and Myanmar, in addition to Accountability Projects for DPRK (HRC res. 34/24) and Sri Lanka (HRC res. 46/1). OHCHR seeks to promote respect and protec - tion of human rights throughout the region by employing a range of tools, including public and private advocacy, human rights mainstreaming in development programming, technical coop - eration and capacity building programmes, protection through presence and monitoring, and support to implement the outcomes of UN human rights mechanisms. OHCHR actively seeks to strengthen civil society and the capac - ity of NHRIs in the region, and to build strong working relationships with national govern - ments and state institutions. NHRIs in the region vary in their compliance with interna - tionally accepted standards for NHRIs ('Paris Principles'). OHCHR's South-East Asia Regional Office also actively engages with the sub-re - gional intergovernmental human rights mechanism of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), known as the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR). There is no equivalent subre - gional human rights mechanism in the Pacific. CURRENT HUMAN RIGHTS CONTEXT This diverse and dynamic region includes countries such as China, India, Pakistan and Indonesia, which in terms of population are among the world's largest, as well as island states in the Pacific whose populations number in the low thousands. In terms of respect, protection and enjoyment of human rights, the region pres - ents opportunities as well as challenges. Some countries, such as Nepal and Sri Lanka, have emerged from conflict. At the same time, partic - ularly violent and egregious conflicts continued in Afghanistan and Myanmar, and protracted national or localized conflicts persisted in a number of other countries, fuelling a range of human rights concerns. Migration within and from Asia, caused by a variety of social, economic and political factors, accounts for approximately 45% of the world's 250 million migrants. More than 80% of all displaced per - sons are found in the region, for a wide variety of reasons, including conflict, systemic discrim - ination, poverty, and climate change. Economic, social and cultural rights. Parts of the region are frequently exposed to envi - ronmental hazards, including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, typhoons, and 153 ENGAGEMENT IN THE REGIONS | ASIA PACIFICother natural crises. These disproportion - ately affect the most vulnerable. Low-lying coastal areas and many island states are directly threatened by climate change and rising sea levels; the existence of atoll nations in the Pacific is in question. While some coun - tries in the region have achieved significant economic growth and development, marked and growing disparities in wealth exist within and between States, leaving entire popula - tions, communities, and individuals behind. Average standards of living have markedly improved; however, inequalities and discrim - ination remain high, further marginalising vulnerable groups, exacerbating poverty, reducing already low levels of human secu - rity, and limiting access to justice, basic services and economic opportunities. Discrimination, especially against margin - alized groups. The region has a rich mix of ethnic and indigenous groups, religions, customs and traditions. Levels of violence against women are high, especially in South Asia and the Pacific, notwithstanding laws and policies for their protection and engage - ment by civil society. Asia and the Pacific host some 60% of the world's young people; more than 750 million (about 19% of the region's population) are aged between 15 and 25. The rise of nationalism and populism in many parts of the region has been accompanied by incitement to hatred, including through social media, that notably targets youth insecurities and often marginalised or 'at risk' groups and communities. Civil and political rights and civic space. Democratic and civil society space is shrink - ing in many parts of the region. Fundamental freedoms, including freedom of assembly and peaceful association, expression, information and participation are under threat, due to restrictive laws and policies, digital surveil - lance, and repression of political and other dissenting voices. Local civil society orga - nizations and human rights defenders face harassment and intimidation, while journal - ists and bloggers as well as trades unionists and political activists are subject to threats and at times violence from the authorities or non-State actors. Governments have increas - ingly focused their attention on social and economic development and public security (particularly in the context of counter ter - rorism measures) rather than protection of civil and political rights. The region is char - acterized by governance systems in which the executive is dominant and the legislature and judiciary are weak. Authoritarianism in a growing number of countries is having an adverse effect on enjoyment of a range of human rights. Impunity for serious human rights violations persists, including extra - judicial execution, torture, and enforced disappearance, committed often by law enforcement agencies, frequently with the collusion of powerful political and economic interests. Frontier issues and spotlight populations. Areas of concern include the effects of climate change; lack of focus on sustainable devel - opment and environmental protection for the benefit of youth and future generations; the impact of business activities, particu - larly activities associated with land and the extraction of natural resources; and the effects of labour migration and human trafficking. The Covid-19 pandemic has served as a threat multiplier, increasing inequalities and dis - crimination: it has severely affected the fabric of societies, people's right to health, and their economic livelihoods. Some Governments have declared states of emergency or taken other forms of action that restrict freedom of movement and public participation, creating important governance and civil and political rights challenges.154 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023Asia and the Pacific and the United Nations human rights mechanisms Ratification, reporting and standing invitation (baselines Special Procedure mandate holders Afghanistan X X X X Jan 2019 Yes (2017) Australia X Jan 2021 Yes (2008) Bangladesh X X X X May 2018 No Bhutan X May 2019 No Brunei Darussalam X X X X May 2019 No Cambodia X X Jan 2019 No China X X Nov 2018 No DP.

They include the Regional Office for Europe in Brussels; the Regional Office for Central Asia in Bishkek; HRAs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia and South Caucasus; Human Rights Officers/staff in the Russian Federation; the Human Rights Office in in the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo*; and the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU). OHCHR supports inter-governmental man - dates, including drafting and presentation to the Human Rights Council of the High Commissioner's annual reports on the \"Question of human rights in Cyprus\". OHCHR also sup - ports the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus, who reports annually to the Human Rights Council in Geneva and the General Assembly in New York. OHCHR reports annually to the Human Rights Council on cooperation with Georgia, and participates in the Geneva International Discussions. Since deployment of the HRMMU in 2014, OHCHR monitors the human rights situation in Ukraine and releases public reports, complemented by thematic reporting, includ - ing on Crimea, in accordance with General Assembly resolutions. CURRENT HUMAN RIGHTS CONTEXT Discrimination and exclusion remain sys - temic in many countries of Europe and Central Asia, particularly with regard to economic and social rights. Their effects have been compounded in recent years by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and auster - ity measures in some countries. Vulnerable persons may include but are not limited to: women; youth; persons (LGBTI); persons with HIV/AIDS; persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities; persons with disabilities; and older persons (for whom the right to live independently and in the community, rather than in institutions, is especially relevant). Nationalist policies and exclusionary rhet - oric, which used to be the monopoly of extremist groups, are entering the main - stream. Migrants and other groups, including religious minorities and Roma, have been tar - geted, and incidents of racism, hate speech and xenophobia are increasing in numerous countries across the region. The human rights of migrants in Europe have been increasingly restricted by border controls and by security and defence policies. Human rights concerns include the immigra - tion detention of children, the rising incidence of returns, denial of entry to European ports, and restrictions of the activities of NGOs that provide assistance to migrants. The potential for conflict, and consequent challenges to respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, remain high. Examples include the renewal of hostilities in and around Nagorno-Karabakh (2020), the persistence of tensions in the Western Balkans, and challenges to security and sta - bility in Central Asia. Challenges to democracy and the rule of law are a growing concern. The legacy of protracted conflicts affects the daily lives of many populations that live in their vicinity. In addition to the plight of internally displaced persons and refugees, a wide range of pro - tection issues needs to be addressed to tackle human rights violations, restore the rights of affected people, and build public confidence. * Hereinafter, all references to Kosovo should be understood in full compliance with Security Council resolution 1244 and without prejudice to the status of Kosovo.180 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023Europe and Central Asia and the United Nations human rights mechanisms Ratification, reporting and standing invitation (baselines Special Procedure mandate holders Albania X May 2019 Yes (2009) Andorra X Nov 2020 Yes(2010) Armenia X X X Jan 2020 Yes(2006) Austria X X Jan 2021 Yes (2001) Azerbaijan May 2018 Yes (2013) Belarus X Nov 2020 No Belgium May 2021 Yes (2001) Bosnia & Herzegovina X X X Nov 2019 Yes (2010) Bulgaria X X Nov 2020 Yes (2001) Croatia X X X X X Nov 2020 Yes (2003) Cyprus X X X Jan 2019 Yes (2001) Czech Republic X X Nov 2017 Yes (2000) Denmark May 2021 Yes (2001) Estonia X X May 2021 Yes (2001) Finland May 2017 Yes (2001) France X Jan 2018 Yes (2001) Georgia X X Jan 2021 Yes (2010) Germany May 2018 Yes (2001) Greece X Nov 2021 Yes (2001) Hungary X X Nov 2021 Yes (2001) Iceland Jan 2022 Yes (2000) Ireland X X X Nov 2021 Yes (2001) Italy X Nov 2019 Yes (2001) Kazakhstan X Nov 2019 Yes (2009) Kyrgyzstan X Jan 2020 Yes (2020) Latvia X X May 2021 Yes (2001) Liechtenstein X Jan 2018 Yes (2003) Lithuania Jan 2022 Yes (2001) Luxembourg X Jan 2018 Yes (2001)181 ENGAGEMENT IN THE REGIONS | EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIAEurope and Central Asia and the United Nations human rights mechanisms Ratification, reporting and standing invitation (baselines Special Procedure mandate holders Malta X X X X X X X Nov 2018 Yes (2001) Rep. of Moldova X X Jan 2022 Yes (2010) Monaco X X X X Nov 2018 Yes (2008) Montenegro X X X Jan 2018 Yes (2005) Netherlands X X May 2017 Yes (2001) North Macedonia X X Jan 2019 Yes (2004) Norway May 2019 Yes (1999) Poland X May 2017 Yes (2001) Portugal X May 2019 Yes (2001) Romania X X X Jan 2018 Yes (2001) Russian Fed.

It has human rights components in UN inte - grated missions (UNAMI in Iraq and UNSMIL in Libya); a Regional Office for Middle East and North Africa (ROMENA) in Beirut; country offices in Syria (located in Beirut due to lack of access), Palestine, Tunisia, and Yemen; an HRA in the UNCT in Jordan; and the UN Human Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab Region in Doha. Mandated by the General Assembly, the Centre in Doha covers 25 States, the majority of which are situated in the Arab region (Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and State of Palestine*) and three in South-West Asia (Afghanistan, Iran [Islamic Republic of], and Pakistan). The Centre carries out training and documenta - tion activities on international human rights standards and supports such efforts within the region by Governments, UN agencies and programmes, NHRIs and non-governmental organizations. OHCHR also has dedicated country programmes, which are implemented from Headquarters, on Iran and Egypt. The Human Rights Council continues to man - date the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occu - pied since 1967, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In addition, the Council has mandated Commissions of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and Israel, and an Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Libya. The General Assembly also continues to mandate a Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People. CURRENT HUMAN RIGHTS CONTEXT In addition to widespread loss of life in the region, lockdowns, curfews and other restrictions have had a significant impact on peoples' daily lives. The economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis in the region have been unprecedented, affecting low-income households and day-wage workers, populations living in situations of armed con - flict or unrest and areas subject to sanctions, as well as people on the move. Increased pov - erty and food insecurity have raised significant concerns, notably where public healthcare sys - tems are weak and economies fragile. Groups in vulnerable situations, especially people with disabilities, have been disproportionately affected. Meanwhile, protracted conflicts and violence in the region have continued to inflict incalculable loss of life and damage to physical infrastructure, causing instability in the region amid ongoing violations of international human - itarian and international human rights law. Security bodies in some States have targeted human rights defenders, lawyers and political activists, to silence protest or opposition to government policies, including criticism of gov - ernment responses to the pandemic. Arbitrary detention, extra-judicial killings, torture, and disappearances continue to be documented, notably in the context of counter-terrorism activ - ities. In a number of States, significant concerns have been raised about the conduct of security forces and adherence to the rule of law, fair * Hereinafter, all references to the State of Palestine should be understood in compliance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19.201 ENGAGEMENT IN THE REGIONS | MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICAtrial standards, and due process. Several States have implemented measures limiting or eroding exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. The pandemic has also impacted the situation of persons deprived of their liberty, particularly those held in over - crowded facilities who lack access to adequate healthcare. Numerous States in the region con - tinue to impose the death penalty, and some have executed child offenders. Meanwhile, persistent impunity for past human rights violations and abuses perpetuates cycles of violence. With regard to economic, social and cultural rights, marginalized and disempowered groups, including women, young people and minority communities, suffer restrictions and lack access to social services, education and employment. This situation has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Protests have highlighted the right to health, economic concerns, and governance. People on the move have faced discrimination, hostile statements by public officials, lack of access to basic services, and in some cases arrest and detention. Religious and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTI persons, and other groups in vulnerable situations, continue to be marginalized. Discrimination of women persists in law and practice across the region. A rise in domestic violence was reported in several States during the pandemic. 202 OHCHR MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 - 2023Middle East, the Gulf States and North Africa and the United Nations human rights mechanisms Ratification, reporting and standing invitation (baselines Special Procedure mandate holders Algeria X X X X X X May 2017 No Bahrain X X May 2017 No Egypt X X X Nov 2019 No Islamic Republic of Iran X X X Nov 2019 Yes (2002) Iraq X Nov 2019 Yes (2010) Israel X Jan 2018 No Jordan X X X Nov 2018 Yes (2006) Kuwait Jan 2020 Yes (2010) Lebanon X X X Jan 2021 Yes (2011) Libya X X X X X X X X Nov 2020 Yes (2012) Morocco X X May 2017 No Oman X X X X Jan 2021 No State of Palestine* X X Yes (2014) Qatar May 2019 Yes (2010) Saudi Arabia X X X Nov 2018 No Syrian Arab Rep.
