As part of improving their patient care, residents must be well -versed in inquiry: research, quality improvement, leveraging human and electronic resources, and applying research findings to improve patient care. The Scholarly Activity Program (SAP) for the P hysical Medicine and Rehabilitation program provides residents with a strong foundational skillset , ensuring their effectiveness in evaluating the care of the patient in terms of best pract ices and their proficiency in critical appraisal of peer -reviewed literature, which will help residents develop a pattern of lifelong learning habits. Residents learn the basic principles of how research and Quality Improvement (QI) is conducted, evaluated, explained to patients, and applied to their patients' care. The Scholarly Activity Program is designed to fulfil l the residency program's Practice -Based Learning goals. Scholarly activities of residen ts and faculty are documented and assessed regularly as part of the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Program evaluation and through the annual Faculty and Residents Survey. This executive summary is organized into three parts. In Part I, scholarly act ivity processes and structures are identified and described. Part II provides details regarding resources in place to support scholarly research activities. Part III includes a list of recent faculty and resident activities. PART I - Processes for Scholar ly Activity & Research The Scholarly Activity Program is administered through a variety of teaching strategies, including regular instruction through didactics sessions, engaged participation in QI or research projects, journal club, and presentations at residency -based conferences (Grand Rounds, Case Conferences , etc). Residents are also required to regularly submit scientific abstracts, posters and/or manuscripts to professional associations and publ ishers with the intent to present at conferences or publish in peer -reviewed journals. The sections below provide further details for each type of scholarly activity . The sections below provide further details for each type of scholarly activity . 2 Faculty R esearch and Scholarly Activity PM&R faculty are required to demonstrate involvemen t in resident scholarly activity by pr oviding guidance and support to residents and pa rticipating in clinical dis cussio ns and conferences. Faculty are responsible for commi tting a nd scheduling a portion of the ir time to supporting the schola rly activities of residents. During su ch time, faculty may provide direct consultation and advisement on scholarly topics, the resear ch process, or provide ongoing guidance throughout a project's entire timeline. Faculty also selec t peer-reviewed a nd clinically signific ant resear ch articles for residents to review , appraise and present during journal club activ ities. Faculty are also responsible for the development and implementation of their own scholarly activities in order to expand their own knowledge base and contribute to the body of literature in their specialties. To foster faculty interes t and engagement in resea rch, HonorHeal th offers a faculty developm ent series as well as workshops provided through the ResQIPS program (see below). In addition, teaching faculty will be required to participate in clinical discussions and conferences along with on- site faculty development and training. All faculty will be encouraged to participate in national and regional professional organizations. ResQIPS Curriculum and Workshop Series HonorHealth has developed an innovative framework and curriculum called ResQIPS (Research, Quality Improvement and Patient Safety) , linking education and support on research and QI/PS activities to scholarship , and with the intent of increasing scholarly projects and improving outcomes. ResQIPS is designed to support the advancement of research, quality improvement and scholarship for the network's medical residency and fellowshi p programs and, more broadly, across multiple disciplines in the network. The ResQIPS learning objectives are as follows: Design a significant clinical question that aligns with the ResQIPS Framework Describe the steps involved in conducting investigat or-initiated human subject research & prepare for IRB application submission Use Quality data and tools to support practice or improvement initiatives Describe methodology and design considerations for QI and Research projects Identify tools, resources an d mentors needed to support research activities Develop a scholarly project Collect and analyze data Disseminate findings through local, regional or national presentations and/or through peer - reviewed journal article publication ResQIPS didactic initiativ es include grand rounds presentations, faculty development sessions, workshops. 'snippet sessions' (short, 15 -minute presentations on a research topic of interest), ResQIPS 3 newsletters, 1:1 mentoring sessions, and statistical consultations. Fellowship/Residency , Faculty and IPE projects are showcased to the organization in poster and presentation sessions annually. Journal Club Journal club is des igned to expand skills in app raisal and assimilation of eviden ce from s cientific stud ies. It is a month ly, resident -led, interactive session unde r the supe rvision of Core Faculty and faculty membe rs with c ontent expertise relevant to the topics c hosen for pr esentation. Reading assignments and participation are mandatory. Journal club activities are intended to assist residents in critically analyzing their own care against the most up- to-date information on diagnosis and treatment effectiveness. National and Local Conference Presentations Residents are expected to present a scholarly research project at a local, regional and/or national meeting. Presentations may include a published work, poster and/or podium presentation representing a research project completed during their PM&R residency . Prese ntations will be prepared under supervision of residency faculty and/or physician researcher. Residents' scholarly projects are frequently submitted to the annual \"Academic Excellence Day\", sponsored by the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix, which is designed for residents and fellows and includes poster and oral presentations of case report s and research projects. Selection of showcased projects is through a competitive abstract selection process overseen by the ResQIPS Director and her team. Those selected compete in a poster and or/oral presentation competition that is judged by UA -College of Medicine faculty and invited GME faculty from various organizations. Case Conferences and Grand Rounds HonorHealth Case Conferences and Grand Rounds (IM, FM, etc) include a series of Resident Conferences, giving PM&R residents an opportunity to present clinical topics . Residents may also have opportunity to present at the residency offerings for Grand Rounds or Case Conferences as part of their external rotations. In February 2020, the PM&R Residency program also received approval to begin an HonorHealth PM&R Grand Rounds program for continuing medical education credit that will be open to clinicians across the system. Topics will be presented by residents and faculty of the program as well as local and regional experts in the field. These presentations will focus on the evolving nature of PM&R including changes in 4 procedures, medications/substances used for treatment, available technologies and exercise/therapy guidelines that are not assimilated in practice instantaneously. Quality Projects & Teams All residents are required to participate in a quality team and/or a quality improvement project within the base hospital institution. Residents complete CITI human subject protections training at the start of their residency and are trained regarding the organization's policies and processes for reporting medical errors and near misses. Ouality projects focus on quality measures, patient safety, efficient workflows, improved patient outcomes, or risk management. Residents also attend HonorHealth's Research, Quality Improvement and Patient Safety sessions (ResQIPS) which are collaborative, interprofessional event s planned by Academic Affairs, Quality, HonorHealth Research Institute, Center for Clinical Excellence and Library Services. Academic Affairs also subscribes to IHI Open School which offers QI and Patient Safety modules to the residents. Residents are enco uraged to complete these modules during their residency and may be assigned one or more modules for completion as part of their didactics requirements, especially if deemed relevant to implementation of their scholarly project. Resid ents As Teachers Residents have multiple oppo rtuniti es to pr actice and de velop th eir teaching skills . In addition to the teaching demands r equired from daily interaction with patients, f amilie s, and other health care profession als, residents participate in leading interactive didactic sessions such as Grand Rounds or teaching a didactic session for one of the GME Residency Programs . Addition ally, faculty model and mentor teaching skills on clinical rounds, in didac tic sessions, throu gh committee work, and in near ly all aspects of clinical practice for whi ch they provide supe es to teac h and couns el patients. Th ese interactions are frequently supe rvised by faculty, offering oppo rtuniti es for feedback and improv ement. As residents adv ance, they are expected to take on a greater teaching role, includ ing teaching more junior r esidents and l eading in int eractive didactic sessions. Multiple tools are utilized to assess and provide feedback for improvement on skills at educating patients, famil ies, students, and peers. Facu lty provide daily, face-to-face feedback on resident teaching and counsel ing skills. Residents incorporate this real-time feedback into their daily practice. At the conclusion of each rotation, residents are evaluated by faculty in the six ACGME competencies, including issues releva nt to their teaching perform ance. Residents review these evaluations at the end of each rotation. Medical students complete an evaluation form of residents involv ed in their instruction. 5 Resident peers are periodically called upon to evaluate each o ther. Teaching skills are included in this assess ment. Finally, the faculty advisors and Program Direc tor provide a semiannual Milestone review at which feedback from all these sources is provid ed. Residents utilize this feedback to improve upon their teaching skills. 6 PART II - Resources for Scholarly Activity & Research PM&R Residency Program Resources The PM&R Residency Program p rovides access to HonorHealth resources and PM&R -specific resources including an American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation membership for the PM&R residents . This membership offers a ccess to workshops including a national grand rounds series, podcasts, journal subscriptions, themed cased studies (brain injury, cancer re habilitation medicine, pediatric rehabilitation, new technologies etc), self -assessment tools, certification (Qbank) questions , and a robust online learning portal.
