When the impact of these beliefs is not recognized, great potential for unethical nursing care exists. Thus, this article examines how the theology of one religious tradition, Seventh-day Adventism (SDA), could affect nurses. An overview of SDA history and beliefs is presented, which explains why 'medical missionary' work is central to SDAs. Theological foundations that would permeate an SDA nurse's view of the nursing metaparadigm concepts of person, health, environment (i.e. community), and nursing (i.e. service) are presented. The ethical principles guiding SDA nurses (i.e. principled, case-based, and care ethics) and the implications of these theological foundations for nurses are noted in a Aaron Becks Cognitive Therapy: A Meeting of Minds2011-02-01ISBN 1433113627Ancient Christian Wisdom Aaron Cognitive RyanTerence J BoseKuthaje S PrasannaKodimoole S AggithayaGuruprasad M Integrating modern dermatology and Ayurveda in the treatment of vitiligo and lymphedema in IndiaBACKGROUND Globally, governments have recognized the growing popularity of Complementary and Alternative Medicines and the possibility of their combined use with biomedicine. Decisions within the Government of India have led to a conducive environment for conducting clinical studies, to achieve integration of more than one system of medicine, so that their combined benefits can be brought to bear on chronic, difficult-to-treat conditions. AIM To develop integrative dermatology treatment protocols for patients with long-standing skin diseases who have received treatment from many centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS A team of doctors from modern dermatology, Ayurveda, yoga therapy, and homeopathy studied recruited patients to develop mutual orientation on each therapeutic system and a working knowledge of approach to their clinical diagnosis. Six-hundred thirty-eight patients affected by lower limb lymphedema requiring skin care as a major part of treatment were treated integrating modern dermatology and Ayurveda. Three-hundred eighty-one vitiligo patients were examined and treated to understand the clinical presentations and treatment options in Ayurveda. RESULTS A two-step cluster analysis performed by SPSS Version 16 showed average volume reductions of 13.3% and 23% on day 14, 19.7% and 31.1% on day 45, and 23.4% and 39.7% on day 90 of treatment in small and large lymphedematous limbs. Inflammatory episodes before the onset on this treatment was reported by 79.5% of our lymphedema patients, and 9.4% reported this at the end of three months after our treatment. Among vitiligo patients, we found that 39.6% of patients had pitta, 10.8% had vatha and 0.52% has tridoshaja presentation. There are over 100 treatment options available in Ayurveda to treat vitiligo. DISCUSSION Each system of medicine recognizes the same disease albeit with minor difference in description. Skin care procedures like washing and emollients restore the barrier function and skin health. We have converged Ayurvedic skin care with that of dermatology with an aim of achieving patient management that is better than that achievable by a single system alone. Overload of the lymphatic system due to loss of epidermal barrier function and consequent inflammation from bacteria and soil irritants is responsive to selected Ayurvedic herbal preparations. CONCLUSION It is evident that integration at the therapeutic level is possible, although the pathological basis is interpreted differently. Irrespective of background understanding of the given disease, a mutually oriented multisystem therapeutic team was able to effectively use medicines from more than one system of medicine and to develop guidelines for their prescription and a patient care algorithm.310-334Mar 2011http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/213421652011-04-04 apart but towards the same goal? The view and practices of Tongan traditional healers and western-trained Tongan mental health staffThis study explored the mental health-related beliefs and practices of Tongan Traditional Healers and Tongan workers in the Western-style mental health services in Tonga. The groups showed very different explanatory models and treatment methods for mental health difficulties. A variety of methods, similar to those reported in other Pacific communities, were used by the Tongan Traditional Healers. The Traditional Healers had a negative view of the Western-style system, feeling it did not address the real issues in mental health that they considered more culturally and spiritually-based. Western-trained staff were generally more accepting of traditional healing, and incorporated aspects of Tongan culture into their practice, but did not typically include traditional healing practices. This study aimed to inform efforts to foster more synergy and collaboration between traditional and western healing approaches in Tonga and with Tongans elsewhere. The results may be relevant to other Pacific peoples.89-95Feb 2009Walking apart but towards the A postmaterialist psychology perspective and developmental approach.Like many psychological topics, psychotherapy that is sensitive to spiritual issues can be viewed from both materialist and postmaterialist perspectives.

(from the journal abstract)46-56February 2010Psychotherapy sensitive to spiritual issues2010-03-06 of how nursing has defined spiritualityAIMS: To offer a detailed discussion of the issue of 'lack of critique' in the literature on spirituality in nursing. The discussion will include the limited use of sources from theology and religious studies and the demand to separate spirituality and religion and will go on to examine the consequences of the resulting approach. The drive for unique knowledge to further professionalisation and the demands of inclusiveness are suggested as possible reasons for the development of the current model. The dangers and pitfalls of definition are explored. The paper suggests that theology could provide insights into explaining spirituality. BACKGROUND: The last four decades have seen a proliferation of definitions of spirituality in the nursing literature. Recently, in response to their own concerns and prompts from outside the 'spirituality' community authors have suggested that we revisit this literature with a more critical stance. This paper is in response to that suggestion. During the course of a PhD supervised from a department of practical theology I have critically analysed the literature from several perspectives and this paper is one result of that review. DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: Critical reflection on how spirituality has been defined. CONCLUSION: The lack of critique has produced a bias in the literature towards broad, generic, existential definitions which, together with the intentional divorce from religion and theology have led to definitions which have the tendency to result in a type of spiritual care which is indistinguishable from psychosocial care, hard to explain to patients and difficult to put into practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The acceptance of a diverse range of understandings of spirituality and a greater focus on practical ways of using it in nursing care are the direction the profession should be moving into.1666-1673Jun offer a detailed discussion of the issue of 'lack of critique' in the literature on spirituality in nursing.

A questionnaire survey concerning the use of CAM was administered to chief caretakers (only the mothers) who accompanied children with neurodevelopmental disabilities followed up in our Neurodevelopmental paediatrics clinics. Four hundred and thirty agreed for interview of which 98 (22.8%) had Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). CAM was used in 40.8% for ASD and 21.4% of non-ASD (p < 0.001). We describe the profile of use of CAM in ASD in this part A paper. The three most common type of CAM use was Acupuncture (47.5%), Sensory Integration (42.5%), and Chinese Medicine (30%). About 76.9% of interviewees expected CAM to augment conventional treatment. Although 47.5% used both conventional western medicine and CAM, only 22.4% disclosed the use of CAM to Doctors. The following factors were significantly related to CAM use: father's job and mother's religion. Our frequency of CAM used in children with ASD was lower in Canada (52%) and USA (74%, 92%). The main CAM use in western culture was biological-based therapy whereas acupuncture was the most common CAM used in our locality.454-463Mar 2009Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/187849922011-03-28 22:29:00NCBI PubMedPMID: 18784992Journal of with quality of life of ALS caregiversAbstract It has been repeatedly shown that religiousness and spirituality have positive effects on quality of life (QoL) and outcome in ALS patients. There are, however, very few data on the impact of religiousness/spirituality on ALS caregivers. We determined the impact of religiousness on caregivers and its correlation with quality of life, depression and anxiety. A total of 75 consecutive ALS patients and their informal caregivers were interviewed using tests evaluating religiousness, depression, anxiety, quality of life and satisfaction with life. Results showed that there was a significant correlation between patients and caregivers' public and total religiousness. Caregivers' private religiousness was related to their age and education level, while their public religiousness was related only to their education level. Caregivers' quality of life was related to their private religiousness and satisfaction with life with their total religiousness. We conclude that religiousness is positively associated with ALS caregivers' quality of life and satisfaction with life, in a measure similar to that observed in ALS patients. Health care professionals caring for ALS patients should consider that the needs of the caregivers include religious/spiritual concerns.168-171May 2011http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/213487872011-06-08 22:30:30NCBI PubMedPMID: 21348787Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Official Publication of the World Federation of Neurology Research Group on Motor Neuron assess the attitudes of general and orthopaedic surgical outpatients regarding inquiry into their religious beliefs, spiritual practices, and personal faith.Design Prospective, voluntary, self-administered, and anonymously-completed questionnaire, regarding religious beliefs, spiritual practices, and personal faith, March-August, 2009.Setting General and orthopaedic surgical outpatient settings, Health Services Foundation, College of Medicine, University of South Alabama, a tertiary care academic medical center in Mobile, Alabama.Participants All patients referred for evaluation and management of general and orthopaedic surgical conditions, pre- and postoperatively, were approached.Methodology The questionnaire solicited data regarding patient: (1) demographics; (2) religious beliefs, spiritual practices, and personal faith; and (3) opinions regarding inquiry into those subjects by their surgeon. The latter opinions were stratified on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree.\" Statistical analysis was conducted using software JMP\u00ae 8 Statistical Discovery Software (S.A.S. Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and a 5% probability level was used to determine significance of results.Results Eighty-three percent (83%) of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that surgeons should be aware of their patients' religiosity and spirituality; 63% concurred that surgeons should take a spiritual history; and 64% indicated that their trust in their surgeon would increase if they did so. Nevertheless, 17%, 37%, and 36% disagreed or strongly disagreed with those perspectives, respectively.Conclusions By inference to the best explanation of the results, we would argue that religiosity and spirituality are inherent perspectives of patient-surgeon relationships. Consequently, those perspectives are germane to the therapeutic milieu. Therefore, discerning each patient's perspective in those regards is warranted in the context of an integrative and holistic patient-surgeon relationship, the intent of which is to restore a patient to health and well-being.36-43January2011-02-16 00:02:10ScienceDirectJournal of Surgical Education681DOI 10.1016/j.jsurg.2010.08.007ISSN 1931-7204journalArticle FlaniganShawn Teresa Staff perceptions of the benefits of religion in health and human services nonprofits: evidence from international developmentSome argue faith-based organizations (FBOs) provide desirable moral or spiritual components to health and human service provision, and that services are more effective due to staffs more supportive approach. However, the majority of research has been conducted in the United States, and has focused on the experiences of Christian FBOs. This article examines the benefits that FBO staff in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lebanon, and Sri Lanka believe religious identity brings to the work of their organizations, based on interviews with more than 100 staff of Buddhist, Catholic, Druze, Orthodox Christian, Protestant Christian, Shiite Muslim, and Sunni Muslim FBOs, as well as secular NGOs. The interview data indicate that staff members from most of the religious traditions included in the study believe the faith orientation of their organization brings benefits to their service provision. However, these perceived benefits differ based on country context. Some of these benefits are similar to those often mentioned in the literature on FBOs in the United States; however, other benefits are quite different than those discussed in the US literature.164-194October 2009Staff perceptions of the benefits of religion in health and human services nonprofitshttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/198031142009-10-20 00:17:10NCBI PubMedPMID: 19803114Journal of Health AdmISSN 1079-3739journalArticle FortneyLuke TaylorMolly Meditation in medical practice: a review of the evidence and practiceMeditation practice in the medical setting is proving to be an excellent adjunctive therapy for many illnesses and an essential and primary means of maintaining holistic health and wellness. Rather than being a fringe or marginal concept, meditation is now widely known and accepted as a beneficial mind-body practice by the general public and in the scientific community. Extensive research shows and continues to show the benefits of meditation practice for a wide range of medical conditions. Further efforts are required to operationalize and apply meditation practice in clinical and medical educational settings in ways that are practical, effective, and meaningful.81-90Mar chaplains work with dying patientsUsing Grounded Theory, this study examines the experience of 19 palliative care chaplains in counselling dying people. Taking a broad-based definition of counselling, and using unstructured individual interviews and group work, the study aimed to understand how palliative care chaplains work with patients at the point when it has been decided to cease active treatment, the point where they risk losing hope and falling into despair. Analysing the data using code-based theory building software, the author identified four organic moments in the chaplain-patient relationship, each moment being a discernable development represents the four moments as a theory of 'chaplain as hopeful presence', and offers a description of the way in which the quality of presence can facilitate patients to develop 'a hopeful manner' in which hope is reconfigured into an attribute of being. The author concludes (with Levinas) that chaplains and other palliative care staff should be aware that simply being-with an other can, in itself, be hope role of chaplains with dying patients who have decided to cease seeking a medical cure for their ailment. It identifies four moments in the work chaplains do with such patients: evocative presence, accompanying presence, comforting presence, and hopeful presence. The article confirms the role of presence in spiritual care: recommended competencies for family medicine resident educationSpiritual care is increasingly recognized as an important component of medical care. Although many primary care residency programs incorporate spiritual care into their curricula, there are currently no consensus guidelines regarding core competencies necessary for primary care training. In 2006, the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine's Interest Group on Spirituality undertook a three-year initiative to address this need. The project leader assembled a diverse panel of eight educators with dual expertise in (1) spirituality and health and (2) family medicine. The multidisciplinary panel members represented different geographic regions and diverse faith traditions and were nationally recognized senior faculty. They underwent three rounds of a modified Delphi technique to achieve initial consensus regarding spiritual care competencies (SCCs) tailored for family medicine residency training, followed by an iterative process of external validation, feedback, and consensus modifications of the SCCs. Panel members identified six knowledge, nine skills, and four attitude core SCCs for use in training and linked these to competencies of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. They identified three global competencies for use in promotion and graduation criteria. Defining core competencies in spiritual care clarifies training goals and provides the basis for robust curricula evaluation. Given the breadth of family medicine, these competencies may be adaptable to other primary care fields, to medical and surgical specialties, and to medical student education. Effective training in this area may enhance physicians' ability to attend to the physical, mental, and spiritual needs of patients and better maintain sustainable healing relationships.1897-1904Dec 2010Toward 10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181fa2dd1ISSN 1938-808XjournalArticle care spiritual care providersThe Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association (2002) identifies spiritual care of the dying and their families as a core service for Hospice Palliative Care programs.

DESIGN: The design involved a national mail survey. The subjects were internists, rheumatologists, naturopaths, and acupuncturists. MEASURES: Physician outcome measures were use of and attitudes toward six classes of CAM. Predictors were religious affiliation, intrinsic religiosity, spirituality, and religious traditionalism. RESULTS: There was a 65% response. Naturopaths and acupuncturists were three times as likely as internists and rheumatologists to report no religious affiliation (35% versus 12%, p < 0.001), but were more likely to describe themselves as very spiritual (51% versus 20%, p < 0.001) and to agree they try to carry religious beliefs into life's dealings (51% versus 44%, p < 0.01). Among physicians, increased spirituality and religiosity coincided with more personal use of CAM and willingness to integrate CAM into a treatment program.

Well-being: Mindfulness Meditation, Pro-environmental Behavior and Personal Quality of Life in a Survey from the Social Justice and Ecological Sustainability MovementEmploying data from a mailed survey of a sample of ecologically and spiritually aware respondents (N = 829), the study tests the hypothesized relationship between ecologically sustainable behavior (ESB) and subjective well-being (SWB). The proposed link between ESB and SWB is the spiritual practice of mindfulness meditation (MM). In multiple regression equations ESB and MM independently explain statistically significant amounts of variance in SWB, indicating, for at least the study's sample, that there can be a relationship between personal and planetary well-being. The inter-relationships among SWB, ESB and MM suggest that for specific segments of the general population (e.g., the spiritually inclined) there may not necessarily be an insurmountable conflict between an environmentally responsible lifestyle and personal quality of life. The research reported here also points to the potential for meditative/mindful experiences to play a prominent role in the explanation of variance in SWB, a direction in QoL studies recently highlighted by several Jean Facing existential realities: exploring barriers and challenges to spiritual nursing careAlthough nurses of the past and present recognize the importance of spiritual care to health and healing, in practice and education, spiritual care dwells on the periphery of the profession. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the reasons behind this contradiction. Using the phenomenological approach, open-ended interviews were conducted with 29 individuals, including oncology nurses, patients and their families, chaplains, and hospital administrators. Their accounts reveal examples of how attitudes, beliefs, and practices of the larger organizational culture can shape the everyday lived experience of bedside nursing. Specifically, these influences tend to create a lived space that is uncaring, and a lived time that is \"too tight.\" Moreover, lived body is experienced as an object for technical intervention, and lived other is experienced from a distance rather than \"up close and personal.\" It was argued that, together, these existential experiences of lived time, space, body, and other create formidable barriers to spiritual nursing care.1379-1392Oct 2010http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/205304022010-11-15 WarrenM.

This report describes the development, advertisement, administration and preliminary results of the survey. Over 1200 Buddhist practitioners responded. Electronic advertisements were the most effective means of recruiting participants. Survey participants were mostly well educated with high incomes and white. Participants engaged in Buddhist practices such as meditation, attending meetings and obtaining instruction from a monk or nun, and practiced healthful behaviors such as regular physical activity and not smoking. Buddhist meditative practice was related to psychological mindfulness and general health.18-31Mar 2010A web-based survey of the relationship between buddhist religious practices, health, and psychological characteristics2010-03-23 00:39:21NCBI spiritual ecograms with Native American families and children to promote cultural competence in family therapy.This study signifies an initial step at giving family therapists an important assessment tool as they seek to increase cultural competence with Native American families and children. To determine the relevancy and consistency of utilizing a spiritual ecogram assessment tool with Native Americans, 50 Native American participants, with extensive experience with this population, reviewed, rated, and gave feedback on its use. Although some limitations were noted, results showed that spiritual ecograms were moderately consistent with Native American culture and, if used properly, can help family therapists develop culturally appropriate interventions with Native American families and children.

In the qualitative section, premarital sex, sex with steady girlfriend and religion's impact were highlighted. In the quantitative part, the relations between the religiosity score and past sexual activity, attitude, norms, and self-efficacy with regard to sexual abstinence were investigated. Students who had a higher religious score were significantly more likely to have high self-efficacy in refusing sex, and their attitudes supported their abstinence. Additionally, these students were more likely never to have had a sexual relationship. Findings suggest that greater religious involvement is a protective factor in high-risk sexual behavior.29-36Mar C BargFrances K Positive changes, increased spiritual importance, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among cancer survivorsPURPOSE: Spirituality is an important component of the cancer experience. This study aims to assess characteristics of spiritual health following a cancer diagnosis, and evaluate the relationship between spiritual change and the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among a population-based cohort of cancer survivors. METHOD: A mailed, cross-sectional survey was completed by 614 cancer survivors identified through the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry. All subjects were 3 to 4.5 years postdiagnosis. Relationships between various characteristics of spiritual health and CAM use were examined, along with clinical and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: Although large proportions of individuals reported that having cancer had positively affected their spiritual well-being (eg, 40.3% experienced highly positive spiritual changes, 68% felt a high sense of purpose, 75.9% reported being very hopeful), some individuals experienced negative spiritual change (36.1%) and continued to experience high levels of uncertainty (27.2%). In multivariate analyses, those survivors who felt spiritual life became more important (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21-3.04, P = .006), or experienced positive changes resulting from the cancer experience (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.26-3.15, P = .003), were more likely to use CAM than those who stated otherwise. CONCLUSIONS: Having cancer affects many different aspects of spiritual well-being, both positively and negatively. Positive changes and increased spiritual importance appear to be associated with the use of CAM. Prospective research is needed to test whether integrating CAM into conventional cancer care systems will facilitate positive, spiritually transformative processes among diverse groups of cancer from projective-introjective identification and repetition compulsionOn the basis of mechanisms such as projective-introjective identification, basic affect, affect regulation, and repetition compulsion, we shall try to explain the essence of intrapsychic, interpersonal, and relational family dynamics. We will also try to explain how relational connections mutually intertwine in the family system, what sustains them, and why they are created and recreated again and again. It is in this regard that we will also be able to consider the essential salvational process, which occurs precisely on the basis of these mechanisms, that is, those that represent fundamental purification and salvation. Some basic biblical theological concepts are applied. These provide the basis for integrating the psychological and theological domains of family systems.496-506Dec an Iranian nursing contextThis article reports the results of a qualitative study that used a deep interview method. The aim was to gather lived experiences of clinical nurses employed at government-funded medical centres regarding the non-materialistic and spiritual aspects of the profession that have had an important impact on their job satisfaction. On analysing the participants' concepts of spiritual satisfaction, the following themes were extracted: spiritually pleasant feelings, patients as celestial gifts, spiritual commitment, spiritual penchant, spiritual rewards, and spiritual dilemmas. Content analysis of the data indicated that nurses who viewed these dimensions of job satisfaction as a significant factor considered nursing as an opportunity to worship God while providing care for patients, and regarded their aim as achieving patients' contentment by providing nursing care compatible Student Nurses' Concepts of SpiritualitySpirituality has different meanings to individuals from diverse backgrounds with minimal definitions documented in academe. This qualitative research study was to determine the evolution of student nurses' concepts of spirituality by comparing their definitions on admission and at completion of their nursing education. Student responses are generalized anxiety disorder: a pilot randomized trialThis pilot trial evaluated the efficacy of a multifaith spiritually based intervention (SBI) for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for GAD of at least moderate severity were randomized to either 12 sessions of the SBI (n=11) delivered by a spiritual care counselor or 12 sessions of psychologist-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; n=11). Outcome measures were completed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. Primary efficacy measures included the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Penn State Worry Questionnaire. Data analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat sample using the Last Observation Carried Forward method. Eighteen patients (82%) completed the study. The SBI produced robust and clinically significant reductions from baseline in psychic and somatic symptoms of GAD and was comparable in efficacy to CBT. A reduction in depressive symptoms and improvement in social adjustment was also observed. Treatment response occurred in 63.6% of SBI-treated and 72.3% of CBT-treated patients. Gains were maintained at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. These preliminary findings are encouraging and suggest that a multifaith SBI may be an effective treatment option for GAD. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy of this intervention. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

There was also an assumption that health and social care services would simultaneously become more technically proficient and more concerned with a person's dignity and their individual needs.

In responding to this list of felonies and misdemeanours, I try to justify my excesses by arguing that the critics have not really understood what reductionism involves; that rejecting reductionism is not the same as providing arguments against it; that the ethical dilemmas allegedly associated with reductionist views are endemic to health care; that 'reifying' is what believers in the spiritual realm do; and that the closed minds belong to those who dismiss reductionist science without having studied its achievements.178-190Jul 2010Spirituality and reductionism2010-07-07 LimbGE HodgeDR Developing Spiritual Competency With Native Americans: Promoting Wellness Through Balance and HarmonyNative Americans tend to hold culturally unique beliefs about the origin of problems and the ways in which those problems can be ameliorated. For most Native American tribal communities, spirituality is interconnected with health and well-being. Accordingly, developing some degree of spiritual competency is essential for work with Native American clients. Consequently, this paper discusses the relationship between spirituality and health, highlighting the roles that balance and harmony play in fostering health and well-being in many tribal cultures.

It also discusses spirituality at certain points in t hepatient pathway, such as at the end of life, and finding meaning in ethical, and spiritual competencies of health care providers responding to a catastrophic eventCompassion is a language that is understood across cultures, religions, and nations. Being compassionate and empathetic is a basic responsibility of health care providers responding to disasters. Compassion and empathy cannot be operationalized unless providers show culturally competent, ethically right, and spiritually caring behavior. In addition to being accepting of cultures other than their own, providers must read literature and familiarize themselves with the predominant cultures of the affected population. Ethically right decision making is essentially an act of balancing the risks and benefits to the entire society. Spiritual care is an important dimension of total health, and therefore recognition and resolution of the spiritual needs of disaster victims is an essential role of health care providers. Disaster management is teamwork and therefore requires that health care providers draw on the expertise and support of other team members; coordinating efforts with local religious, social governmental organizations, and NGOs to deal with the intangible effects of the cultural and spiritual impact of a disaster and to prevent further demoralization of the affected community is imperative. Disasters occur, and the only thing that can ameliorate their devastating effects is to improve disaster preparedness and respond collectively and courageously to every catastrophic event.455-464Dec 20102011-01-18 23:58:47NCBI PubMedPMID: 21095554Critical Care A. DosseyLarry Intention, and Observer Effects in Healing Studies: Laying a Foundation for the FutureAll research domains are based upon epistemological assumptions. Periodic reassessment of these assumptions is crucial because they influence how we interpret experimental outcomes. Perhaps nowhere is this reassessment needed more than in the study of prayer and intention experiments. For if positive results from this field of research are sustained, the reality of nonlocal consciousness must be confronted. This paper explores the current status of healing and intention research, citing a number of major studies and using the \"Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP) in Cardiac Bypass Surgery Patients: A Multicenter Randomized Trial of Uncertainty and Certainty of Receiving Intercessory Prayer\" as a case study of this line of research. The paper argues that the dose-dependent model typical of drug trials, and adopted for use in the STEP and other studies, is not the optimal model for intention-healing research, and critiques this approach in detail, citing apposite research from which we draw our recommendations and conclusions. The paper suggests that the usual assumptions concerning blindness and randomization that prevail in studies using the pharmacological model must be reappraised. Experimental data suggest that a nonlocal relationship exists among the various individuals participating in a study, one which needs to be understood and taken seriously. We argue that it is important to account for and understand the role of both local and nonlocal observer effects, since both can significantly affect outcome. Research is presented from an array of disciplines to support why the authors feel these issues of linkage, belief, and intention are so important to a successful, accurate, and meaningful study outcome. Finally, the paper offers suggestions for new lines of research and new protocol designs that address these observer-effect issues, particularly the nonlocal aspects. The paper finally suggests that if these effects occur in intention studies, they must necessarily exist in all studies, although in pharmacological studies they are often overshadowed by the power of chemical and biological agents.295-307September 2010Nonlocality, Intention, and Observer Effects in Healing Studies2010-09-11 23:41:19ScienceDirectEXPLORE: of Science CortisolPainVagal activityyogaYoga clinical research reviewIn this paper recent research is reviewed on the effects of yoga poses on psychological conditions including anxiety and depression, on pain syndromes, cardiovascular, autoimmune and immune conditions and on pregnancy. Further, the physiological effects of yoga including decreased heartrate and blood pressure and the physical effects including weight loss and increased muscle strength are reviewed. Finally, potential underlying mechanisms are proposed including the stimulation of pressure receptors leading to enhanced vagal activity and reduced cortisol. The reduction in cortisol, in turn, may contribute to positive effects such as enhanced immune function and a lower prematurity rate.1-8February rhinosinusitis patients<AbstractText Label=\"OBJECTIVE\" NlmCategory=\"OBJECTIVE\">The worldwide interest in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been established in multiple surveys. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is often an unremitting disease with frequent troubling relapses, and despite wide use of endoscopic sinus surgery, conventional medicine may have a smaller contribution than expected. Because of prevalent use of CAM among patients, it is important that physicians acquire basic knowledge of this subject.

Previous studies consistently show that student wellbeing is at its lowest pre-exam. Little core-curriculum is traditionally dedicated to providing self-care skills for medical students. This paper describes the development, implementation and outcomes of the Health Enhancement Program (HEP) at Monash University. It comprises mindfulness and ESSENCE lifestyle programs, is experientially-based, and integrates with biomedical sciences, clinical skills and assessment. This study measured the program's impact on medical student psychological distress and quality of life. A cohort study performed on the 2006 first-year intake measured effects of the HEP on various markers of wellbeing. Instruments used were the depression, anxiety and hostility subscales of the Symptom Checklist-90-R incorporating the Global Severity Index (GSI) and the WHO Quality of Life (WHOQOL) questionnaire. Pre-course data (T1) was gathered mid-semester and post-course data (T2) corresponded with pre-exam week. To examine differences between T1 and T2 repeated measures ANOVA was used for the GSI and two separate repeated measures MANOVAs were used to examine changes in the subscales of the SCL-90-R and the WHOQOL-BREF. Follow-up t-tests were conducted to examine differences between individual subscales. A total of 148 of an eligible 270 students returned data at T1 and T2 giving a response rate of 55%. 90.5% of students reported personally applying the mindfulness practices. Improved student wellbeing was noted on all measures and reached statistical significance for the depression (mean T1 = 0.91, T2 = 0.78; p = 0.01) and hostility (0.62, 0.49; 0.03) subscales and the GSI (0.73, 0.64; 0.02) SCL-90, but not the anxiety subscale (0.62, 0.54; 0.11). Statistically significant results were also found for the psychological domain (62.42, 65.62; p < 0.001) but not the physical domain (69.11, 70.90; p = 0.07) of the WHOQOL. This study is the first to demonstrate an overall improvement in medical student wellbeing during the pre-exam period suggesting that the common decline in wellbeing is avoidable. Although the findings of this study indicate the potential for improving student wellbeing at the same time as meeting important learning objectives, the limitations in study design due to the current duration of follow-up and lack of a control group means that the data should be interpreted with caution. Future research should be directed at determining the contribution of individual program components, long-term outcomes, and impacts on future attitudes and clinical practice.387-398Aug 2009Enhancing the health of medical studentshttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/185166942009-11-01 15:40:19NCBI PubMedPMID: 18516694Advances Health Sciences medicine: double standards?OBJECTIVES: The principles of evidence-based practice (EBP) are fundamental to medical ethics and seem essential for any form of health care. In 2000, a House of Lords Select Committee recommended that the ethos of EBP should extend to complementary and alternative medicine. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether EBP is incorporated in the codes of ethics of British complementary and alternative medicine organizations. METHODS: We obtained the codes of the following bodies: Association of Naturopathic Practitioners, Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine (UK), Ayurvedic Practitioners Association, British Acupuncture Council, Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council, European Herbal Practitioners Association, General Chiropractic Council, General Osteopathic Council, General Regulatory Council for Complementary Therapies, National Institute of Medical Herbalists, Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Society of Homeopaths, UK Healers, Unified Register of Herbal Practitioners. We then extracted the statements referring to EBP and compared this with what the respective codes of British doctors and nurses proscribed. RESULTS: Only the General Chiropractic Council, the General Osteopathic Council and the General Regulatory Council for Complementary Therapies oblige their members to adopt EBP. CONCLUSIONS: This discloses double standards in UK health care which may compromise patient safety.219-223Oct 2009Evidence-based practice in British complementary and alternative medicinehttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/197701192009-10-27 12:40:19NCBI PubMedPMID: 19770119Journal of Health 10.1258/jhsrp.2009.009009ISSN 1355-8196journalArticle Muslim parents: \"the four principles\" are not as culturally neutral as suggestedThe \"four principles approach\" has been popularly accepted as a set of universal guidelines for biomedical ethics. Based on four allegedly trans-cultural principles (respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice), it is supposed to fulfil the need of a 'culturally neutral approach to thinking about ethical issues in health care'. On the basis of a case-history, this paper challenges the appropriateness of communicating in terms of these four principles with patients with a different background. The case describes the situation in which Muslim parents bring forward that their religion keeps them from consenting to end-of-life decisions by non-religious paediatricians. In a literature analysis, the different meanings and roles of the relevant principles in non-religious and Islamic ethics are compared. In non-religious ethics, the principle of nonmaleficence may be used to justify withholding or withdrawing futile or damaging treatments, whereas Islamic ethics applies this principle to forbid all actions that may harm life. And while the non-religious version of the principle of respect for autonomy emphasises the need for informed consent, the Islamic version focuses on \"respect for the patient\". We conclude that the parties involved in the described disagreement may feel committed to seemingly similar, but actually quite different principles. In such cases, communication in terms of these principles may create a conflict within an apparently common conceptual framework. The four principles approach may be very helpful in analysing ethical dilemmas, but when communicating with patients with different backgrounds, an alternative approach is needed that pays genuine attention to the different backgrounds.1383-1387Nov 2009Communicating with Muslim Maria de Alcohol use and spirituality among nursing studentsThe purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate alcohol use and the levels of spirituality among nursing students. The tests used were the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and the Spirituality Scale. Participants were 191 (80.2%) nursing undergraduates from a city in the state of Minas Gerais, 75.4% of which were female, average age 25 years, and 149 (78%) were Catholic. As for alcohol use per gender, 117 (75%) women used alcoholic beverages and 33 (56.9%) had a drinking problem (p?0.05), against 25 men (431%). Low scores for spirituality levels were found in the sample: in average, women had lower scores compared to men (12.7 against 13.5). Comparing the level of spirituality with having a drinking problem, it was observed that students with low risk alcohol use had lower levels of spirituality. In conclusion, spirituality may not function as a protecting factor for alcohol use, hence this behavior may be under the control of other variables.100-107Mar 2011http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/214454952011-04-04 23:40:12NCBI PubMedPMID: 21445495Revista self-care: expanding self-care deficit nursing theoryThe authors propose an integration of the concepts of spirituality and spiritual self-care within Orem's self-care deficit nursing theory as a critical step in theory development. Theoretical clarity is needed to understand the contributions of spirituality to health and well-being. Spirituality is the beliefs persons hold related to their subjective sense of existential connectedness including beliefs that reflect relationships with others, acknowledge a higher power, recognize an individual's place in the world, and lead to spiritual practices. Spiritual self-care is the set of spiritually-based practices in which people engage to promote continued personal development and well-being in health and illness.48-56Jan 2011Spirituality religions, spirituality, ethics and nursing.

On the whole, four research questions were engaged. The sample for the study included residents in urban (Benin City) and rural (Ehime Mbano) communities in Nigeria. The instruments comprised of two questionnaires. The traditional healers were also interviewed in addition. The findings of the research included the following: in both rural and urban areas, women and more elderly persons had more recourse than other groups to traditional medicine; Christians, less educated persons, self-employed persons and women affirmed most strongly to the efficacy of traditional medicine over Western medicine with respect to certain ailments; ways for averting spiritual illnesses included obeying instructions from ancestors and offering regular sacrifices to the gods; methods used by traditional healers to determine whether an ailment was \"spiritual\" or as a result of home problems included diagnosis linked to divination, interpretation of dreams particularly those involving visits by ancestors, interpretation of nightmares and omens such as the appearance of owls; methods for curing patients included use of herbs particularly those believed to have magical powers, offering of sacrifices, use of incantations and wearing of protective medicine.99-104Feb psychologists tell their stories2010ISBN 9780830838851journalArticle TusaieKathleen EddsKelly Understanding and Integrating Mindfulness Into Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing PracticeThe practice of mindfulness is increasingly being integrated into Western clinical practice within the context of psychotherapy and stress management.

With a growing interest in such therapies, physicians need a simple tool with which to get an overview of the scientific publications on CAM, particularly those that are not listed in common bibliographic databases like MEDLINE. CAMbase is an XML-based bibliographical database on CAM which serves to address this need. A custom front end search engine performs semantic analysis of textual input enabling users to quickly find information relevant to the search queries. This article describes the technical background and the architecture behind CAMbase, a free online database on CAM (www.cambase.de). We give examples on its use, describe the underlying algorithms and present recent statistics for search terms related to complementary therapies overview of 45 published database resources for complementary and alternative medicineBackground: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has succeeded to implement itself in the academic context of universities. In order to get information on CAM, clinicians, researchers and healthcare professionals as well as the lay public are increasingly turning to online portals and databases, which disseminate relevant resources. One specific type of online information retrieval systems, namely the database, is being reviewed in this article. Question: This overview aims at systematically retrieving and describing all databases covering the field of CAM. One of the requirements for inclusion was that the database would also have to be published in a medical journal. Data sources: The databases amed, CAMbase, embase, and medline/PubMed were searched between December 2008 and December 2009 for publications relevant to CAM databases. The authors' specialist library was also searched for grey literature to be included. Study selection: All included databases were then visited online and information on the context, structure and volume of the database was extracted. Main results: Forty-five databases were included in this overview. Databases covered herbal therapies (n = 11), traditional Chinese medicine (n = 9) and some dealt with a vast number of CAM modalities (n = 9), amongst others. The amount of time the databases had been in existence ranged from 4 to 53 years. Countries of origin included the USA (n = 14), UK (n = 7) and Germany (n = 6), amongst others. The main language in 42 of 45 databases was English. Conclusions: Although this overview is quite comprehensive with respect to the field of CAM, certain CAM practices such as chiropractic, massage, reflexology, meditation or yoga may not have been covered adequately. A more detailed assessment of the quality of the included databases might give additional insights into the listed resources. The creation of a personalised meta-search engine is suggested, towards which this overview could be seen as a first step.93-10505/2010http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1471-1842.2010.00888.xHealth Information & disabilitiesThe Practice of Reality Therapy from the Islamic Perspective in Malaysia and Variety of Custom in Asia.This article is meant to observe the practice of reality therapy in the context of Islamic perspective in Malaysia. Besides this, the article is also reviewing the related research on reality therapy in Asia. The method used by the author is based on library research. Findings show that there is a connection between WDEP aspects with the Islamic perspective. This finding also shows that Islam does not prohibit its followers to help individuals in that its method is not in conflict with the syariat, ibadah and akhlak. This relationship is explained in Al-Quran, Hadith, view of ulama' and kias. Moreover, the authors give example of reality therapy practice in Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Australia. All reality therapy practice in Asian countries still perpetuates the WDEP procedure based on their own culture and religion. As a conclusion, the WDEP procedure can be used universally with the aspect of religion and culture in a community. The authors view is that reality therapy cannot be separated from Islam as a living style, especially in Malaysia. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]3-8Spring2009 2009EBSCOhostInternational Journal of arrogance and myopia-allopathic and holisticOver the past two decades, researchers have successfully accumulated lots of data pointing to a salutary impact of religious involvement. But progress in the religion and health field has been inhibited by the relative lack of attention to important conceptual and theoretical issues. This paper asserts that until we focus as much on the latter as on the former, this field will remain marginalized and thus ineffective in contributing to understandings of the determinants of health and healing. Careful attention to the how and why of a religion-health connection is imperative for bringing this research into the mainstream of biomedicine.482-495Dec primer for rheumatologistsOver the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in meditation as a mind-body approach, given its potential to alleviate emotional distress and promote improved well being in a variety of populations.

A national qualitative studyINTRODUCTION In the United States, ectopic pregnancies are relatively common and associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services (the Directives) govern the provision of care in Catholic-affiliated hospitals and prohibit the provision of abortion in almost all circumstances. Although ectopic pregnancies are not viable, some Catholic ethicists have argued that the Directives preclude physicians at Catholic hospitals from managing tubal pregnancies with methods and procedures that involve \"direct\" action against the embryo. METHODS We undertook this qualitative study to explore the relationship between the Directives, hospital policies regarding ectopic pregnancy management, and clinical practices. We recruited participants at non-Catholic, longstanding Catholic, and recently merged facilities and conducted focused interviews with 24 physicians at 16 hospitals in 10 states. FINDINGS Participants from three Catholic facilities reported that medical therapy with methotrexate was not offered because of their hospitals' religious affiliation. The lack of methotrexate resulted in changes in counseling and practice patterns, including managing ectopic pregnancies expectantly, providing the medication surreptitiously, and transferring patients to other facilities. Further, several physicians reported that, before initiating treatment, they were required to document nonviability through what they perceived as unnecessary paperwork, tests, and imaging studies. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that some interpretations of the Directives are precluding physicians from providing women with ectopic pregnancies with information about and access to a full range of treatment options and are resulting in practices that delay care and may expose women to unnecessary risks.104-1092011 Mar-AprDo religious restrictions influence ectopic pregnancy management?http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/213539772011-04-04 23:46:40NCBI PubMedPMID: 21353977Women's Health Issues: Official Publication Women's Health212Womens Health IssuesDOI 10.1016/j.whi.2010.11.006ISSN 1878-4321journalArticle theologyPSYCHOLOGY & religionPSYCHOLOGY, ReligiousPsychotherapyConsiderations and Recommendations for Use of Religiously Based Interventions in a Licensed Setting.Human beings are uniquely created with varying degrees of biological, psychological, sociological, and spiritual differences. Research suggests that many clients bring spiritual issues and concerns to counseling and request religiously accommodating interventions often in the form of prayer, scripture reading or referral to scripture, assurances of forgiveness by God, or forgiveness of self or others. These heightened requests from clients for religiously accommodating interventions must be matched by the clinician's heightened sensitivity to the disclosure of religious views, cultural diversity, and religious diversity through use of an advanced informed consent. This article will examine the ethical considerations in the use of religiously-congruent interventions through a more in-depth analysis of one specific approach to religiously accommodating interventions, i.e., Theophostic Prayer Ministry. It closes with suggestions for expanded informed consent when assisting clients requesting religiously accommodating interventions.

We attempt to examine potential mechanisms that have been proposed as mediators for the RS and mental health relation. We also examine more philosophical areas including patient and physician opinions about inclusion of RS in patient care, and ethical issues that may arise. We review suggested guidelines for sensitive patient inquiry, and opportunities and challenges for education of psychiatrists and trainees. We also study practical ways to incorporate psychospiritual interventions into patient treatment, with specific reference to more common spiritual issues such as forgiveness, gratitude, and altruism.292-301May 20092011-02-22 23:58:31NCBI PubMedPMID: PsychiatryISSN 0706-7437journalArticleAcademic Medicine: the evidence in \"evidence-based\" integrative medicine programsAlternative therapies are popular, and information about them should be included in the curricula of health profession schools. During 2000 to 2003, the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine awarded five-year education grants to 14 health professions schools in the United States and to the American Medical Students Association Foundation. The purpose of the grants was to integrate evidence-based information about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) into the curriculum. The authors reviewed the educational material concerning four popular CAM therapies-herbal remedies, chiropractic, acupuncture, and homeopathy-posted on the integrative medicine Web sites of the grant recipients and compared it with the best evidence available. The curricula on the integrative medicine sites were strongly biased in favor of CAM, many of the references were to poor-quality clinical trials, and they were five to six years out of date. These \"evidence-based CAM\" curricula, which are used all over the country, fail to meet the generally accepted standards of evidence-based medicine. By tolerating this situation, health professions schools are not meeting their educational and ethical obligations to learners, patients, or society. Because integrative medicine programs have failed to uphold educational standards, medical and nursing schools need to assume responsibility for their oversight. The authors suggest (1) appointing faculty committees to review the educational materials and therapies provided by integrative medicine programs, (2) holding integrative medicine programs' education about CAM to the same standard of evidence used for conventional treatments, and (3) providing ongoing oversight of integrative level in Chinese Original Quiet SittingBACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Some research has shown that melatonin levels increase after meditation practices, but other research has shown that they do not. In our previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we found positive activation of the pineal body during Chinese Original Quiet Sitting (COQS). To find other supporting evidence for pineal activation, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of COQS on nighttime melatonin levels. METHODS: Twenty subjects (11 women and 9 men, aged 29-64 years) who had regularly practiced daily meditation for 5-24 years participated in this study. All subjects served alternately as participants in the mediation and control groups. COQS was adopted in this study. Tests were performed during two nighttime sessions. Saliva was sampled at 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes after COQS and tested for level of melatonin. Time period effect analysis and mixed effect model analysis were preceded by paired t test analysis. RESULTS: In the meditation group (n = 20), the mean level of melatonin was significantly higher than the baseline level at various times post-meditation (p < 0.001). Within the control group (n = 20), the mean level of melatonin at various times was not significantly different compared with baseline (p>0.05). These results suggested that the melatonin level was statistically elevated in the meditation group and almost unchanged in the control group after nighttime meditation. The urine serotonin levels detected by measuring 5-hydroxy-indole-3-acetic acid levels were also studied, but no detectable difference between the groups was found. CONCLUSION: Our results support the hypothesis that meditation might elevate the nighttime salivary melatonin levels. It suggests that COQS can be used as a psychophysiological stimulus to increase endogenous secretion of melatonin, which in turn, might contribute to an improved sense of well-being.694-701Oct 2010http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/209700652010-11-15 19:54:19Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Zhi10910J.

OBJECTIVE The present study was performed to evaluate the impact of a spiritual approach consisting of Kriya Yoga program alone or in association with melatonin (MLT) or low-dose IL-2 plus MLT on the survival time in a group of metastatic cancer patients with life expectancy less than 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS A case-control study was carried out in 240 patients (M/F: 146/94; median age: 62 years, range: 34-71, suffering from non-small-cell lung cancer or gastrointestinal tumors) who were subdivided into 6 groups of 40 patients, treated with supportive care alone as a control group, supportive care plus Yoga, MLT alone, MLT plus Yoga, inteleukin-2 plus MLT, or IL-2 plus MLT plus Yoga. RESULTS The best results in terms of increased survival time were obtained by the association between neuroimmunotherapy with MLT plus IL-2 and Yoga program (2 years), which was significantly longer with respect to that achieved by supportive care alone, Yoga alone, or IL-2 plus MLT alone (1 year). CONCLUSIONS This study would suggest that a spiritual therapeutic approach may improve the survival time of untreatable metastatic solid tumor nurses and social workers: a comparison based on their involvement with the dyingThe purpose of the study was to compare spiritual beliefs and practices between nurses and health care social workers based on their involvement with dying patients. Exposure to the dying was identified by two indicators: the percentage of terminally ill patients in the provider's care and the work environment. On the basis of the literature, differences were expected between the two types of professionals and the three degrees of involvement with the dying. Nurses were expected to have a higher spiritual perspective than social workers; and health care providers with high involvement in care for the dying were expected to hold the highest levels of spiritual beliefs. Contrary to expectations, no differences in spirituality were found between nurses and social workers; both groups exhibited medium levels of spirituality. Furthermore, health care providers who were highly involved with dying patients had the lowest spiritual perspectives. Tentative explanations of these unexpected results are presented and discussed.239-2522009Spiritual beliefs among Israeli nurses and social workers2011-02-22 23:38:43NCBI PubMedPMID: (Westport)ISSN 1558-3163 YoungLaura A Mindfulness meditation: a primer for rheumatologistsOver the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in meditation as a mind-body approach, given its potential to alleviate emotional distress and promote improved well being in a variety of populations. The overall purpose of this review is to provide the practicing rheumatologist with an overview of mindfulness and how it can be applied to Western medical treatment plans to enhance both the medical and psychological care of patients.63-75Feb 2011Mindfulness meditation2011-03-15 18:29:26NCBI SwintonJohn PattisonStephen Moving beyond clarity: towards a thin, vague, and useful understanding of spirituality in nursing careSpirituality is a highly contested concept. Within the nursing literature, there are a huge range and diversity of definitions, some of which appear coherent whereas others seem quite disparate and unconnected. This vagueness within the nursing literature has led some to suggest that spirituality is so diverse as to be meaningless. Are the critics correct in asserting that the vagueness that surrounds spirituality invalidates it as a significant aspect of care? We think not. It is in fact the vagueness of the concept that is its strength and value. In this paper, we offer a critique of the general apologetic that surrounds the use of the language of spirituality in nursing. With the critics, we agree that the term 'spirituality' is used in endlessly different and loose ways. Similarly, we agree that these varied definitions may not refer to constant essences or objects within people or in the world. However, we fundamentally disagree that this makes spirituality irrelevant or of little practical utility. Quite the opposite; properly understood, the vagueness and lack of clarity around the term spirituality is actually a strength that has powerful political, social, and clinical implications. We develop an understanding of spirituality as a way of naming absences and recognizing gaps in healthcare provision as well as a prophetic challenge to some of the ways in which we practise health care within a secular and sometimes secularizing context such as the National Health Service.226-237Oct 2010http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/208401342010-11-15 20:02:08journalArticle KingMichael B KoenigHarold G Conceptualising spirituality for medical research and health service provisionThe ne ed to take account of spirituality in research and health services provision is assuming ever greater importance. However the field has long been hampered by a lack of conceptual clarity about the nature of spirituality itself. We do not agree with the sceptical claim that it is impossible to conceptualize spirituality within a scientific paradigm. Our aims are to 1) provide a brief over-view of critical thinking that might form the basis for a useful definition of spirituality for research and clinical work and 2) demystify the language of spirituality for clinical practice and research.116July at the Edge: Incorporating Spirituality and Religion Into PsychotherapyIncorporating spirituality and religion into psychotherapy has been controversial, but recent contributions have argued the importance and provided foundations for doing so. Discussions of ethical challenges in this process are emerging, and this contribution discusses several preliminary issues, relying on the Resolution on Religious, Religion-Based and/or Religion-Derived Prejudice adopted by the American Psychological Association in 2007, as guidance when used with the American Psychological Association's (2002) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct. Specifically, this discussion of preliminary challenges addresses competence, bias, maintaining traditions and standards of psychology, and integrity in labeling services for reimbursement. Commentators deepen the discussion, addressing what constitutes minimal competence in this area; effective and truly mutual collaboration with clergy; the high level of ethical complexity and \"inherent messiness\" of this domain of psychological practice; and the particular challenges of demarcating the boundaries of these domains for regulatory and billing purposes. This discussion offers decidedly preliminary ideas on managing the interface of these domains. Further development is needed before this nascent area approximates precise guidelines or standards.385-395AUG 2009Ethical Challenges and Opportunities at the AdultAbortion and protection of the human fetus: religious and legal problems in PakistanAbortion is the most common and controversial issue in many parts of the world. Approximately 46 million abortions are performed worldwide every year. The world ratio is 26 induced abortions per 100 known pregnancies. Pakistan has an estimated abortion rate of 29 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age, despite the procedure being illegal except to save a woman's life. 890,000 abortions are performed annually in Pakistan. Many government and non-government organizations are working on the issue of abortion. Muslim jurists are unanimous in declaring that after the fetus is completely formed and has been given a soul, abortion is haram (forbidden).55-592009Abortion and protection of the human fetus2010-01-29 WegelaKaren The courage to be present : Buddhism, psychotherapy, and the awakening of natural wisdom2011ISBN 9781590308301journalArticle PesutBarbara FowlerMarsha of tension: enriching the discourseThe tremendous growth in nursing literature about spirituality has garnered proportionately little critique. Part of the reason may be that the broad generalizing claims typical of this literature have not been sufficiently explicated so that their particular implications for a practice discipline could be evaluated. Further, conceptualizations that attempt to encompass all possible views are difficult to challenge outside of a particular location. However, once one assumes a particular location in relation to spirituality, then the question becomes how one resolves the tension between what are essentially theological or philosophical commitments and professional commitments. In this study, we discuss the tension between these perspectives using the idea of a responsible nursing response to spiritual pluralism. We then problematize three claims about spirituality in nursing discourse based upon our location as scholars influenced by Christian theological understandings: (i) the claim that all individuals are spiritual; (ii) the claim that human spirituality can be assessed and evaluated; and (iii) the claim that spirituality is a proper domain of nursing's concern and intervention. We conclude by suggesting that the widely shared values of social justice, compassion and human dignity may well serve as a grounding for the critique of spiritual discourses in nursing across particularized positions.337-346Dec The effect of an educational session on pediatric nurses' perspectives toward providing spiritual careThis study evaluated the effect of a spiritual education session on pediatric nurses' perspectives toward providing spiritual care. A one-group pretest and posttest design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational session. Participants consisted of 41 pediatric and neonatal nurses that worked in a large university-affiliated children's hospital. Findings confirmed that the spiritual education session had a positive effect on nurses' perspectives toward providing spiritual care. In addition, a positive correlation was identified between the pediatric nurses' perception of their own spirituality and their perspective toward providing care.34-43Jan mindfulness and psychologyAs the field of psychology continues to expand and evolve, one fruitful avenue of exploration has been the integration of mindfulness into psychological theory and practice. Mindfulness is defined as the awareness that arises out of intentionally attending in an open and discerning way to whatever is arising in the present moment. Two decades of empirical research have generated considerable evidence supporting the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions across a wide range of clinical and nonclinical populations, and these interventions have been incorporated into a variety of health care settings. Still, there are many unanswered questions and potential horizons to be investigated. This special issue endeavors to assist in this exploration. It presents a combination of articles concerning aspects of clinical and scientific integration of mindfulness within psychotherapy and psychoeducational settings. This commentary attempts to highlight the main findings of the featured articles as well as elucidate areas for future inquiry. Taken as a whole, the volume supports the importance and viability of the integration of mindfulness into psychology, and offers interesting and meaningful directions for Terapanthi Svetambar Jain monks in IndiaThe main objective of the study was to determine the oral hygiene levels and periodontal status among Jain monks attending a Chaturmass in Udaipur, India. To date, no study has been conducted on Jain monks. The study comprises of 180 subjects and the overall response rate was 76% among them. Oral hygiene status was assessed by the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) of Greene, Vermillion14 (1964), and periodontal status was assessed by the Community Periodontal Index. Additional information was collected regarding food habits, education level and oral hygiene habits. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Chi Square Test and Step-wise multiple linear regression analysis were carried out using SPSS Software (11.0). The results showed that the oral hygiene status of Jain monks was poor and only 5.6% of the subjects had good oral hygiene. Overall periodontal disease prevalence was 100% with bleeding and shallow pocket contributing a major part (72.8%) among all the age groups (p < 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that oral hygiene habits, caloric intake and education level explained a variance of 11.7% for the Oral hygiene index collectively. The findings confirmed that Jain monks have poor oral hygiene and an increased prevalence of periodontal disease compared to that of the similarly aged general population because, as a part of their religion, many Jain individuals avoid brushing their teeth especially during fasting, keeping in mind not to harm the microorganisms present in the mouth.370-3762009 interviewingPsychotherapyreligionContributions From Ethics and Research That Guide Integrating Religion Into Psychotherapy<p><br/>Historically ignored or \"treated,\" clients' religious beliefs are being incorporated into psychotherapy because they influence client and therapist thinking and have potential to heal and harm.

Ethical codes emphasize self-determination, beneficence, and nonmaleficence, which lead to different treatment decisions depending on how they are prioritized.

There is also a progressive trend toward use of yoga as a mind-body complementary and alternative medicine intervention to improve specific physical and mental health conditions. To provide clinicians with therapeutically useful information about yoga, the evidence evaluating yoga as an effective intervention for children and adolescents with health problems is reviewed and summarized. A brief overview of yoga and yoga therapy is presented along with yoga resources and practical strategies for clinical practitioners to use with their patients. The majority of available studies with children and adolescents suggest benefits to using yoga as a therapeutic intervention and show very few adverse effects. These results must be interpreted as preliminary findings because many of the studies have methodological limitations that prevent strong conclusions from being drawn. Yoga appears promising as a complementary therapy for children and adolescents.

The development of a pilot blended learning event, as described in this paper, sought to integrate the competencies into practice by providing opportunities both online and in the classroom to explore this aspect of holistic care in depth. In the planning stages, multiprofessional focus groups determined the level of delivery, and emerging themes shaped the content. Self-awareness and reflection were key features and part of the overall process to improve competency. The features of the virtual learning environment (VLE) used were video, facilitated asynchronous discussion and direct links to key articles and documents, while interactive classroom activities built on prior learning. Evaluation covered all aspects of the course design from participant and facilitator perspectives. Participant comments were overwhelmingly positive in relation to the content and chosen delivery methods with concerns about online learning proving unfounded.86-92Feb 2009Developing spiritual and religious care competencies in of Health Benefits of Qigong and Tai ChiObjective Research examining psychological and physiological benefits of Qigong and Tai Chi is growing rapidly. The many practices described as Qigong or Tai Chi have similar theoretical roots, proposed mechanisms of action, and expected benefits. Research trials and reviews, however, treat them as separate targets of examination. This review examines the evidence for achieving outcomes from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of both. Data Sources The key words Tai Chi, Taiji, Tai Chi Chuan, and Qigong were entered into electronic search engines for the Cumulative Index for Allied Health and Nursing (CINAHL), psychological literature (PsycINFO), PubMed, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar. Study Inclusion Criteria RCTs reporting on the results of Qigong or Tai Chi interventions and published in peer-reviewed journals from 1993 to 2007. Data Extraction Country, type and duration of activity, number/type of subjects, control conditions, and reported outcomes were recorded for each study. Synthesis Outcomes related to Qigong and Tai Chi practice were identified and evaluated. Results Seventy-seven articles met the inclusion criteria. The nine outcome category groupings that emerged were bone density (n = 4), cardiopulmonary effects (n = 19), physical function (n = 16), falls and related risk factors (n = 23), quality of life (n = 17), self-efficacy (n = 8), patient-reported outcomes (n = 13), psychological symptoms (n = 27), and immune function (n = 6). Conclusions Research has demonstrated consistent, significant results for a number of health benefits in RCTs, evidencing progress toward recognizing the similarity and equivalence of Qigong and Tai Chi.e1-e2507/2010http://ajhpcontents.org/doi/abs/10.4278/ajhp.081013-LIT-248American Journal of Health Promotion246American Journal of Health PromotionDOI 10.4278/ajhp.081013-LIT-248ISSN 0890-1171journalArticle ShoresCynthia I Spiritual perspectives of nursing studentsHolistic nursing care requires attention to spiritual aspects of a person. The purpose of this descriptive, non-experimental study was to describe spiritual perspectives of nursing students. Students' spiritual perspectives were measured and described using Reed's Spiritual Perspective Scale (SPS).The convenience sample consisted of 205 nursing students enrolled in a baccalaureate nursing program in the southeastern United States. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Findings suggest that nursing students in this sample perceived themselves as having a high level of spirituality as indicated by scores on the SPS (M = 5.04, SD = 0.9). Reliability of the SPS was estimated by determining Cronbach's alpha (0.94). Findings of this study contribute to the body of nursing knowledge concerning the spirituality of nursing students.

In the early days of the palliative care and hospice movement there was concern that aggressive pain control with opioids could potentially hasten the death of the patient primarily through respiratory depression. For many ethicists and theologians who were opposed to active euthanasia, this raised the difficult question of whether it is permissible to use these potentially harmful medications. Traditional Jewish decisors also addressed this question and their writings can shed light on their attitudes toward terminal care. The purpose of this article is to analyze the view of three highly respected authorities on the use of pain medications with potentially significant side effects in terminal patients. The Jewish position demonstrates how an ancient tradition struggles to develop an ethic consistent with modern sensibilities. Religious decisors scour the ancient sources to find precedents and then apply that wisdom to contemporary questions. Jewish medical ethics by its very nature is highly pluralistic because there is no central body that determines policy and a wide spectrum of opinions are usually found. However, regarding pain treatment there appears to be a broad consensus mandating its aggressive use even at the risk of significant side effects as long as the motivation is relief of suffering.67-71Jan 2010\"Love your neighbor Me Story Teaching in Palliative and Hospice Care--The Science, the Benefits, the How To (528): Humanities and SpiritualityObjectives 1. Define story-teaching, distinguish it from story telling, describe benefits identified by research in education and psychology sciences, and demonstrate applicability in palliative and end-of-life care. 2. Describe and demonstrate story-teaching methodology, applications, and event triggers for patients and families, students and practitioners new to palliative and end-of-life care, and the general public. 3. Develop attendees story-teaching skills through hands-on exercises, and provide resources for attendees to teach this methodology to colleagues not in attendance. From the caves at Lascaux to Grimm's fairy tales and beyond, humans have used story to share hard-earned experience and shorten learning curves for other members of the tribe. Experts claim the human brain is hardwired to receive story and data shows that information conveyed through story is understood and retained at higher rates than when the same information is delivered \"bare.\" Data also demonstrates that under optimal circumstances patients/families typically retain only 40% of information shared by healthcare providers. As the amount of information increases if the news is unfavorable, and if the patient is ill or on medication, memory and understanding are further impaired. Research from psychology and education sciences shows that story teaching\u2014true story illustrating fact\u2014enhances learning, fosters critical and creative thinking, and improves problem-solving skills. Story teaching is especially effective for those who have experienced surprises or expectation failures and need to reshape goals and expectations\u2014common experiences for patients/families at end of life. It's recognized as a non-threatening way to introduce learning when anxiety compromises comprehension and recall. It brings abstract concepts to life, while inviting the listener to apply his or her values to interpret meaning. In classrooms and public-policy dialogue, true story combined with data enhances recall and fosters empathy. It creates interest and provides cohesion of facts, while conveying nuance and complexity. Like any intervention, story teaching must be goal-specific and apply a methodology to achieve efficacy. This session will share the foundations of effective story teaching, engage participants in active learning to enhance story-teaching skills, and provide tools to teach this technique to colleagues in all disciplines.

Both seek to promote healing. Yoga seeks the attainment of consciousness; osteopathy aims for providing support to health. One fundamental difference is the personal involvement of the individual in yoga. Teacher and student alike are challenged to re-examine the attitudes of mind they have adopted toward their lives. Osteopathy generally involves a relatively passive patient while the osteopath is active in providing treatment. Practical examples are used to highlight points of contact between yoga and osteopathy. The text includes a discussion of the importance of physicality and a description of ways of using it in healing processes. Furthermore, processes of attaining consciousness are outlined. Possible reductionist misconceptions in yoga and osteopathy are also pointed out. Fundamental attitudes and focus that complement each other are presented, taking the concept of stillness as a particular example.92-102January benefits: exploring the body through complementary and alternative medicineSince the 1960s, in Western societies, there has been a striking growth of consumer interest in complementary or alternative medicine (CAM). In order to make this increased popularity intelligible this paper challenges stereotypical images of users' motives and the results of clinical studies of CAM by exploring bodily experiences of acupuncture, reflexology treatments, and mindfulness training. The study draws on 138 in-depth interviews with 46 clients, client diaries and observations of 92 clinical treatments in order to identify bodily experiences of health and care: experiences that are contested between forces of mastery, control and resistance. We discuss why clients continue to use CAM even when the treatments do not help or even after they have been relieved of their physiological or mental problems. The encounter between the client and CAM produces derivative benefits such as a fresh and sustained sense of bodily responsibility that induces new health practices.719-733Jul 2009Derivative benefitshttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/193929402011-02-04 the 1960s, in Western societies, there has been a striking growth of consumer interest in complementary or alternative medicine (CAM).

Participants were given questionnaires measuring attitudes regarding stem cell research, along with the Need for Closure scale, the Internal Control Index, the Need for Uniqueness scale, religious orientation scales, and the Literal-Antiliteral-Mythological scale. Results indicate that those who hold more traditional religious beliefs are likely to oppose stem cell research for moral reasons, whereas those who have a more open-ended approach to religion are likely to be in favor of such research. Results also showed that personality variables were helpful in predicting people's confidence in institutions' ability to manage the ethical questions surrounding such research.

Aim of treatment is pain relief. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to practices which are not an integral part of orthodox medicine. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To determine the pattern of usage of CAM among OA patients in Nigeria. PATIENTS AND METHODS Consecutive patients with OA attending orthopaedic clinic of Havana Specialist Hospital, Lagos, Nigeria were interviewed over a 6- month period st st of 1 May to 31 October 2007 on usage of CAM. Structured and open-ended questions were used. Demographic data, duration of OA and treatment as well as compliance to orthodox medications were documented. RESULTS One hundred and sixty four patients were studied.120 (73.25%) were females and 44(26.89%) were males. Respondents age range between 35-74 years. 66(40.2%) patients used CAM. 35(53.0%) had done so before presenting to the hospital. The most commonly used CAM were herbal products used by 50(75.8%) of CAM users. Among herbal product users, 74.0% used non- specific local products, 30.0% used ginger, 36.0% used garlic and 28.0% used Aloe Vera. Among CAM users, 35(53.0%) used local embrocation and massage, 10(15.2%) used spiritual methods. There was no significant difference in demographics, clinical characteristics and pain control among CAM users and non-users. CONCLUSION Many OA patients receiving orthodox therapy also use CAM. Medical doctors need to keep a wary eye on CAM usage among patients and enquire about this health-seeking behaviour in order to educate them on possible drug interactions, adverse effects and long term complications.44-47Mar 2011http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/214451122011-04-04 MorganGeoff Independent advocacy and the \"rise of spirituality\": views from advocates, service users and chaplainsThe Mental Capacity Act (2005) and the amendments to the Mental Health Act (1983) in 2007-which came into effect in 2007 and 2009, respectively, in England and Wales-made it a statutory duty for the NHS and local authorities to refer to advocacy services. This is part of a growth in advocacy which coincides with an increase in literature on mental health and spirituality. Independent advocates and spiritual care coordinators (or chaplains) provide expressions of advocacy. For Independent Mental Capacity Advocates, social, cultural and spiritual factors are influential. Research involved a literature review on the history of advocacy and interviews with over 30 advocates, chaplains and service users and subsequent grounded theory analysis. The attested \"rediscovery of the spiritual dimension in health and social care\" was supported by overlaps in the practices of advocates and chaplains. This highlighted shortcomings around the professionalisation of advocacy in relation to culture and spirituality.625-6369/2010http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&doi=10.1080/13674676.2010.488435&magic=crossref||D404A21C5BB053405B1A640AFFD44AE3journalArticle SmithAmy Rex Nursing and spirituality: what happened 13:49:23NCBI PubMedPMID: 19824578Journal Christian Christian Fellowship264J Christ NursISSN 0743-2550journalArticleWord & World301 LawsonKaren Spirituality in medicine: What is its role, today and tomorrow?71-802010journalArticle Van den BrandenStef BroeckaertBert Living in the hands of God. English Sunni e-fatwas on (non-)voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicideEver since the start of the twentieth century, a growing interest and importance of studying fatwas can be noted, with a focus on Arabic printed fatwas (Wokoeck 2009). The scholarly study of end-of-life ethics in these fatwas is a very recent feature, taking a first start in the 1980s (Anees 1984; Rispler-Chaim 1993). Since the past two decades, we have witnessed the emergence of a multitude of English fatwas that can easily be consulted through the Internet ('e-fatwas'), providing Muslims worldwide with a form of Islamic normative guidance on a huge variety of topics. Although English online fatwas do provide guidance for Muslims and Muslim minorities worldwide on a myriad of topics including end-of-life issues, they have hardly been studied. This study analyses Islamic views on (non-)voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide as expressed in English Sunni fatwas published on independent--i.e. not created by established organisations--Islamic websites. We use Tyan's definition of a fatwa to distinguish between fatwas and other types of texts offering Islamic guidance through the Internet. The study of e-fatwas is framed in the context of Bunt's typology of Cyber Islamic Environments (Bunt 2009) and in the framework of Roy's view on the virtual umma (Roy 2002). '(Non-)voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide' are defined using Broeckaert's conceptual framework on treatment decisions at the end of life (Broeckaert 2008). We analysed 32 English Sunni e-fatwas. All of the e-fatwas discussed here firmly speak out against every form of active termination of life. They often bear the same structure, basing themselves solely on Quranic verses and prophetic traditions, leaving aside classical jurisprudential discussions on the subject. In this respect they share the characteristics central in Roy's typology of the fatwa in the virtual umma. On the level of content, they are in line with the international literature on Islamic end-of-life ethics. English Sunni e-fatwas make up an influential and therefore important developing body of Islamic orthodox normative authority on end-of-life ethics that is still open for further research.29-41Feb 20112011-03-15 18:26:55NCBI PubMedPMID: The validity and reliability of an instrument to assess nursing competencies in spiritual careAIM: This study contributes to the development of a valid and reliable instrument, the spiritual care competence scale, as an instrument to assess nurses' competencies in providing spiritual care. BACKGROUND: Measuring these competencies and their development is important and the construction of a reliable and valid instrument is recommended in the literature. DESIGN: Survey. METHOD: The participants were students from Bachelor-level nursing schools in the Netherlands (n = 197) participating in a cross-sectional study. The items in the instrument were hypothesised from a competency profile regarding spiritual care. Construct validity was evaluated by factor analysis and internal consistency was estimated with Cronbach's alpha and the average inter-item correlation. In addition, the test-retest reliability of the instrument was determined at a two-week interval between baseline and follow-up (n = 109). RESULTS: The spiritual care competence scale comprises six spiritual-care-related nursing competencies. These domains were labelled: 1 assessment and implementation of spiritual care (Cronbach's alpha 0.82) 2 professionalisation and improving the quality of spiritual care (Cronbach's alpha 0.82) 3 personal support and patient counseling (Cronbach's alpha 0.81) 4 referral to professionals (Cronbach's alpha 0.79) 5 attitude towards the patient's spirituality (Cronbach's alpha 0.56) 6 communication (Cronbach's alpha 0.71). subscales showed good homogeneity with correlations >0.25 and a good test-retest reliability. CONCLUSION: This study conducted in a nursing-student population demonstrated valid and reliable scales for measuring spiritual care competencies. The psychometric quality of the instrument proved satisfactory. This study does have some methodological limitations that should be taken into account in any further development of the spiritual care competence scale. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The spiritual care competence scale can be used to assess the areas in which nurses need to receive training in spiritual care and can be used to assess whether nurses have developed competencies in providing spiritual care.2857-2869Oct 2009http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/192206182009-10-20 00:09:32NCBI PubMedPMID: 19220618journalArticle RosenfieldGeorge W Identifying and integrating helpful and harmful religious beliefs into psychotherapyThe 2 main roles of the psychotherapist involve identifying and understanding the client's problems/strengths and treating problems.

(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all Mindfulness Practice: Incorporating the Findings of Neuroscience into Pastoral Care and Counseling.This article draws on recent neuroscientific research evidence that demonstrates the plasticity and malleability of the human brain to make the case for greater use of contemplative and mindfulness practices in pastoral care and counseling. It explores the negativity bias of the brain as it has evolved and argues that mindful awareness practices have the ability to work against this bias in favor of less fearful and anxious perspectives on life, including interpersonal relationships. Contending for a higher evaluation of Christian practices than beliefs, it specifically targets the doctrine of original sin as a contributor to this negativity bias, and advocates the use of Christian meditative practices, especially the Centering Prayer, as a means to foster brain resculpting that is integral to the experience of becoming aware of oneself as a new creation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]477-489June 2011The Art of NursingLearning effects of thematic peer-review: a qualitative analysis of reflective journals on spiritual careThis study describes the learning effects of thematic peer-review discussion groups (Hendriksen, on developing nursing students' competence in providing spiritual care. It also discusses the factors that might influence the learning process. The method of peer-review is a form of reflective learning based on the theory of experiential learning (Kolb, 1984. Experiential learning, Experience as the source of learning development. Englewoods Cliffs, New Jersey, Prentice Hill). It was part of an educational programme on spiritual care in nursing for third-year undergraduate nursing students from two nursing schools in the Netherlands. Reflective journals (n=203) kept by students throughout the peer-review process were analysed qualitatively The analysis shows that students reflect on spirituality in the context of personal experiences in nursing practice. In addition, they discuss the nursing process and organizational aspects of spiritual care. The results show that the first two phases in the experiential learning cycle appear prominently; these are 'inclusion of actual experience' and 'reflecting on this experience'. The phases of 'abstraction of experience' and 'experimenting with new behaviour' are less evident. We will discuss possible explanations for these findings according to factors related to education, the students and the tutors and make recommendations for follow-up research.413-422May a suitable intervention for hospitalised patients: a critical review of the literatureAIM This critical review seeks to identify if there is evidence that private (personal) prayer is capable of improving wellbeing for adult patients in hospital. BACKGROUND The review was conducted in the belief that the spiritual needs of hospitalised patients may be enhanced by encouragement and support to engage in prayer. DESIGN Systematic review. METHOD A systematic approach was used to gather evidence from published studies. In the absence of experimental research involving this type of population, evidence from qualitative and correlational studies was critically reviewed. Results. The findings indicate that private prayer, when measured by frequency, is usually associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety. Most of the studies that show positive associations between prayer and wellbeing were located in areas that have strong Christian traditions and samples reported a relatively high level of religiosity, church attendance and use of prayer. Church attenders, older people, women, those who are poor, less well educated and have chronic health problems appear to make more frequent use of prayer. Prayer appears to be a coping action that mediates between religious faith and wellbeing and can take different forms. Devotional prayers involving an intimate dialogue with a supportive God appear to be associated with improved optimism, wellbeing and function. In contrast, prayers that involve pleas for help may, in the absence of a pre-existing faith, be associated with increased distress and possibly poorer function. CONCLUSION Future research needs to differentiate the effects of different types of prayer. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Encouragement to engage in prayer should be offered only following assessment of the patient's faith and likely content and form of prayer to be used. Hospitalised patients who lack faith and whose prayers involve desperate pleas for help are likely to need additional support from competent nursing and chaplaincy staff.637-651Mar 2009Private prayer as Literature as TopicScienceDivine intervention? A Cochrane review on intercessory prayer gone beyond science and reasonWe discuss in this commentary a recent Cochrane review of 10 randomised trials aimed at testing the religious belief that praying to a god can help those who are prayed for. The review concluded that the available studies merit additional research. However, the review presented a scientifically unsound mixture of theological and scientific arguments, and two of the included trials that had a large impact on the findings had problems that were not described in the review. The review fails to live up to the high standards required for Cochrane reviews.72009Divine intervention?2011-02-22 23:55:37NCBI science of energy therapies and contemplative practice: a conceptual review and the application of zero balancingThe topic of energy therapies is prompted by the increasing attention of healthcare practitioners and consumers to Eastern philosophies and ancient healing practices. This article includes a conceptual framework of quantum physics principles providing the basis of interpretation of energetic phenomena, along with the exploration of theoretical concepts involving energy as a communicational network. An overview of the contemplative tradition of meditation indicates its necessity as a requisite element of energy therapies, the practice combining a knowledge base of the core scientific precepts with the experience of restorative strategies. The relevance of energy therapies as a path to self-transcendence along with the application of a specific touch technique, Zero Balancing, is highlighted.315-3342009 Nov-DecThe science of energy therapies and contemplative 19901607journalArticle FanningJoseph B ClaytonEllen Wright Genetics, MedicalHumansreligionReligious and spiritual issues in medical geneticsThis article provides an overview of a special issue on the religious and spiritual concerns that arise in the provision of genetic services.

A number of well-controlled studies support the use of meditation for blood pressure reduction. In addition, research suggests that meditative practices are associated with improvements in attention, behavior, and psychological functioning in children and youth. More rigorous comparative effectiveness research in larger, diverse pediatric populations is needed to be confident that these results are related specifically to the instruction and practice of meditative practices and to tailor recommendations to specific patients. Despite the desirability of additional research, meditation is a very safe practice, with a variety of approaches that can suit diverse unique needs, values, and preferences.

Several previous authors concur on this point, suggesting a particularly good fit between cognitive therapy and the Islamic tradition relative to other forms of psychotherapeutic intervention. This paper explores the process of cognitive therapy and the models of depression upon which it is based, highlighting areas of resonance and dissonance with Islamic thought. The paper advocates the development of cognitive behavioural psychotherapeutic content and technique informed by Islamic tradition. We argue that such spiritually and culturally attuned interventions, in many cases, will be more appropriate and clinically effective for clients with world views shaped by Islam.

Although many people dream and consider their dreams to hold some significant spiritual meaning, spiritual care providers have been reluctant to incorporate patients' dreams into the therapeutic conversation. Not every dream can be considered insightful, but probing the meaning of some dreams can enhance spiritual care practice. Hill's Cognitive-Experimental Dream Interpretation Model is applied in the current article as a useful framework for exploring dreams, gaining insight about spiritual problems, and developing a therapeutic plan of action. Bulkeley's criteria for dream interpretation were used to furnish safeguards against inappropriate application of dream interpretation to spiritual assessment and interventions.87-94Jan 2011http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/215340692011-06-08 22:54:59NCBI PubMedPMID: ChaplainDOI 10.1080/08854726.2011.559862ISSN 1528-6916<p>This article encourages discussion of dreams as a part of therapeutic care of patients by pastoral care providers.

The aim was to explore students' reactions to experiences provided, and consider potential benefits for future clinical practice. METHODS: The SSC was delivered in the workplace. Active learning was encouraged through facilitated discussion with and observation of clinicians, the palliative team, counselling services, hospital chaplaincy and healing ministries; sharing of medical histories by patients; and training in therapeutic communication. Assessment involved reflective journals, literature appraisal, and role-play simulation of the doctor-patient consultation. Module impact was evaluated by analysis of student coursework and a questionnaire. RESULTS: Students agreed that the content was stimulating, relevant, and enjoyable and that learning outcomes were achieved. They reported greater awareness of the benefit of clinicians engaging in care of the \"whole person\" rather than \"the disease.\" Contributions of other professions to the healing process were acknowledged, and students felt better equipped for discussion of spiritual issues with patients. Many identified examples of activities which could be incorporated into core teaching to benefit all medical students. CONCLUSION: The SSC provided relevant active learning opportunities for medical students to receive training in a whole-person approach to patient care.1204-1209Dec ChapekCynthia How family practice physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants incorporate spiritual care in practicePURPOSE: To investigate how primary care family practice providers incorporate spirituality into their practices in spite of documented barriers.

CONCLUSIONS: Five major theme clusters emerged: (1) discerning instances for overt spiritual assessment; (2) displaying a genuine and caring attitude; (3) encouraging the use of existing spiritual practices; (4) documenting spiritual care for continuity of care; (5) managing perceived barriers to spiritual care.

Meditative movement forms of PA, such as tai chi and qigong (TC & QG), are holistic in nature and have increased in popularity over the past few decades. Several randomized controlled trials have evaluated TC & QG interventions from multiple perspectives, specifically targeting older adults. The purpose of this report is to synthesize intervention studies targeting TC & QG and identify the physical and psychological health outcomes shown to be associated with TC & QG in community dwelling adults older than 55. Based on specific inclusion criteria, 36 research reports with a total of 3,799 participants were included in this review. Five categories of study outcomes were identified, including falls and balance, physical function, cardiovascular disease, and psychological and additional disease-specific responses. Significant improvement in clusters of similar outcomes indicated interventions utilizing TC & QG may help older adults improve physical function and reduce blood pressure, fall risk, and depression and anxiety. Missing from the reviewed reports is a discussion of how spiritual exploration with meditative forms of PA, an important component of these movement activities, may contribute to successful aging.245-279Mar 20092011-02-23 00:56:09NCBI conscious psychological care.There is increasing recognition of the importance of identifying and perhaps incorporating into psychological services the spiritual and religious beliefs and practices (SRBP) of patients. Research suggests that psychologists are reluctant to address the SRBP of their patients, because they are unsure how to do so without contravention of ethical standards. Moreover, numerous approaches have been published and promoted, and psychologists may feel overwhelmed by the profusion of advice. We organize the suggested approaches into four categories and place them on a continuum, and we discuss the ethical concerns related to each. At one end is spiritually avoidant care, which entails the attempt to avoid conversations with patients about their SRBP. Given the importance of these issues to psychological health and to understanding the patient, this approach is untenable. At the other end of the continuum, spiritually directive psychotherapy is characterized by an explicit attempt to maintain or change the SRBP of patients. Spiritually integrated psychotherapy entails utilizing SRBP to ameliorate patients' emotional distress. We suggest that psychologists should at least engage in spiritually conscious care, which we characterize as the explicit assessment of the general importance of SRBP to the patient, its influence on the presenting problem, and the potential of SRBP as a resource to help recovery. Specific suggestions are presented for how spiritually conscious care might be implemented. Finally, the need for better training in both basic and specific competencies needed to address patients' SRBP is reviewed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved).

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive, and correlational. SETTING: Israeli Oncology Nurses Society annual conference in June 2006. SAMPLE: A convenience sample of 147 Israeli nurses who were exposed to death in their daily work. Most worked in oncology departments and were of Jewish faith. METHODS: Completion of the Frommelt Attitude Toward Care of the Dying Scale, Death Attitude Profile-Revised Scale, and a demographic questionnaire. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Attitudes toward caring for dying patients, attitudes toward death (fear of death, death avoidance, and types of death acceptance), and demographic variables (e.g., religiosity). FINDINGS: Nurses demonstrated positive attitudes toward care of dying patients. The attitudes were significantly negatively correlated with death avoidance, fear of death, and approach acceptance of death. A mediating role of death avoidance was found between fear of death and attitudes toward caring for dying patients. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses' personal attitudes toward death were associated with their attitudes toward the care of dying patients. The mediating model suggests that some nurses may use avoidance to cope with their own personal fears of death. Inconsistency between the current results and previous studies of associations between acceptance of death and attitudes toward care for dying patients imply that culture and religion might play important roles in the development of these attitudes. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Training and support programs for oncology nurses should take into consideration nurses' personal attitudes toward death as well as their religious and cultural in research design and statistics.Doing integration in research and statistics oriented courses presents unique challenges to faculty. The content of these courses seems far removed from the integration of faith and learning as generally understood in the literature. Faith-praxis integration provides an overarching vision that rises above the content of a given course and impacts many aspects of the educational process for both the faculty member and the student. Developing expertise in research skills becomes a spiritual exercise that has import for the student's motivations, goals and character. For faculty, faith-praxis integration carries implications for how their faith can be lived out in their courses. It will affect interactions with students outside of class as well.

Translating religious arguments into \"generally accessible language\" (Habermas, Eur J Philos 14(1):1-25, 2006) to enable them to play a role in political decisions is a common task for religious and non-religious citizens. The article discusses Habermas' view, questioning the particular role of religion, but accepting the significance of including such counter-voices to the predominant views. Furthermore it is pointed out that not only religious but also numerous secular views stand in need of translation to be able to bear on policy matters. Accepting Habermas' general framework, I raise the question whether experts (such as clinicians working in relevant specialised areas of care) participating in political debates on biomedical issues have a duty to state their religious worldview, and to what extent the American government decision to restrict embryo stem cell research is an illegitimate transgression of the State-Church Faculty Practice ModelRisk FactorsIntegrating faith and health in the care of persons experiencing homelessness using the Parish Nursing Faculty Practice Model.This article describes the Parish Nurse Faculty Practice Model (PNFPM), which provides care to a medically underserved, high-risk homeless population at a community-based, multipartner service center. The PNFPM offers a holistic integrated approach to care of the mind, body, and spirit and encourages those who are homeless to draw on their faith to improve their health. The faculty practice integrates faith and spirituality as a way to improve health and decrease health disparities using Healthy People 2010's Focus Areas to guide the practice. A variety of approaches are used including art therapy, cognitive behavioral approaches, exercise and health behavior strategies, screenings, advocacy, and referrals. This PNFPM can be replicated by others working with persons who are homeless or other underserved populations.

For this reason it is claimed that nurses need to be able to offer spiritual care when appropriate and, to aid them in this, nurse theorists have discussed the nature of spirituality. In a recent debate John Paley has argued that nurses should adopt a naturalistic stance which would enable them to employ the insights of modern science. Barbara Pesut has criticized this thesis, especially as it is applied to palliative care. This paper re-examines this debate with particular attention to the meaning of 'spirituality' and the justification for accepting spiritual and religious theories. It is argued that when we take into consideration the great diversity among religious and spiritual ideas, the lack of rational means of deciding between them when they conflict, and the practicalities of nursing, we find that a spiritual viewpoint is less useful than a naturalistic one, when offering palliative care.71-80Apr into psychiatric careSpirituality is important to many psychiatric patients, and these patients may be moved toward recovery more effectively if their spiritual needs are addressed in treatment. This, however, is rarely given expression in the psychiatric services of teaching hospitals. In order to develop this potential area of improved care, we (1) evaluated the differential attitudes of patients and psychiatric trainees toward the value of spirituality in the recovery process, (2) established a program of group meetings conducted by psychiatric residents and staff where patients can discuss how to draw on their spirituality in coping with their problems, and (3) established related training experiences for psychiatric residents. The results and implications of these three initiatives are presented.81-91Mar 2011http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/197280952011-04-04 23:48:36NCBI H FitzpatrickJoyce J An exploratory study of spiritual dimensions among nursing studentsThis exploratory descriptive study of spiritual experiences, well-being, and practices was conducted among 126 nursing students. Participants reported a higher level of spiritual well-being and life scheme than self-efficacy for well-being and life-scheme. Thus, students appeared to view the world and their role in it slightly more positively than their ability to affect their lives and make decisions. The students reported the most frequent spiritual experiences as being thankful for blessings; the next most frequent spiritual experiences having a desire to be close to God, feeling a selfless caring for others, and finding comfort in one's religion and spirituality. Students used both conventional and unconventional spiritual practices. Further study is necessary to study the relationship among spiritual practices, daily spiritual experiences, and spiritual well-being among nursing students and to evaluate these before and after implementation of specific educational offerings focused on spirituality and spiritual care in nursing.Article402010http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/210440402010-11-15 19:52:09International Journal of Nursing Education Scholarship71Int J Nurs Educ ScholarshDOI 10.2202/1548-923X.1915ISSN 1548-923XjournalArticleAmerican Journal of Medical Genetics. Part C, Seminars in Medical Genetics151C1Am J Med Genet Predisposition to DiseaseHealth StatusHumansMalereligionA religious framework as a lens for understanding the intersection of genetics, health, and diseaseThe primary goal of this study was to determine the extent to which religious frameworks inform lay public understandings of genes and disease. Contrary to existing research, there were minimal differences between racial groups. We did, however, observe two patterns in that data that are worthy of discussion. First, because participants were from the south, the finding that participants from both racial groups ascribe to a religious belief system to make sense of their lived experiences is not surprising. Rather, it appears to be reflective of the religious culture that is an integral part of the south and our identity as a nation. A second noteworthy finding is that while a significant number of participants believe that a relationship exists between health status, genes, and religious behaviors, they also recognize that positive health behaviors must also be adopted as a means for staving off disease. In some cases, however, there was a belief that health issues could dissolve or disappear as a result of certain religious behaviors such as prayer.22-30Feb 15, 20092011-02-23 00:56:57NCBI and clinical decisions: findings from a national physician surveyBACKGROUND: Patient autonomy has been promoted as the most important principle to guide difficult clinical decisions. To examine whether practising physicians indeed value patient autonomy above other considerations, physicians were asked to weight patient autonomy against three other criteria that often influence doctors' decisions. Associations between physicians' religious characteristics and their weighting of the criteria were also examined. METHODS: Mailed survey in 2007 of a stratified random sample of 1000 US primary care physicians, selected from the American Medical Association masterfile. Physicians were asked how much weight should be given to the following: (1) the patient's expressed wishes and values, (2) the physician's own judgment about what is in the patient's best interest, (3) standards and recommendations from professional medical bodies and (4) moral guidelines from religious traditions. RESULTS: Response rate 51% (446/879). Half of physicians (55%) gave the patient's expressed wishes and values \"the highest possible weight\". In comparative analysis, 40% gave patient wishes more weight than the other three factors, and 13% ranked patient wishes behind some other factor. Religious doctors tended to give less weight to the patient's expressed wishes. For example, 47% of doctors with high intrinsic religious motivation gave patient wishes the \"highest possible weight\", versus 67% of those with low (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Doctors believe patient wishes and values are important, but other considerations are often equally or more important. This suggests that patient autonomy does not guide physicians' decisions as much as is often recommended in the ethics literature.214-218Apr 2009Autonomy, religion and clinical Methodology ResearchReligion and PsychologySuicide, AssistedReligion and nurses' attitudes to euthanasia and physician assisted suicideIn this review of empirical studies we aimed to assess the influence of religion and world view on nurses' attitudes towards euthanasia and physician assisted suicide. We searched PubMed for articles published before August 2008 using combinations of search terms. Most identified studies showed a clear relationship between religion or world view and nurses' attitudes towards euthanasia or physician assisted suicide. Differences in attitude were found to be influenced by religious or ideological affiliation, observance of religious practices, religious doctrines, and personal importance attributed to religion or world view. Nevertheless, a coherent comparative interpretation of the results of the identified studies was difficult. We concluded that no study has so far exhaustively investigated the relationship between religion or world view and nurses' attitudes towards euthanasia or physician assisted suicide and that further research is required.303-318May Integrating Spirituality and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Older AdultsThis article presents a theoretical approach to a spiritually integrated cognitive behavioral therapy for older adults, by formulating a modified style of assessment, formulation, beginning therapy, cognitive restructuring, behavior modification, and termination.219July 2009Toward Holistic Carehttp://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/155280309028039132009-09-26 21:15:16InformaworldJournal of Religion, Spirituality & 1552-8030journalArticle Abdel-KhalekAhmed M Quality of life, subjective well-being, and religiosity in Muslim college studentsBACKGROUND: The majority of published research in quality of life (QOL), subjective well-being (SWB), and religiosity has been carried out on Western populations. The objective of this study was to explore the associations between QOL, SWB, and religiosity in an Arabic, Muslim, and understudied sample. METHODS: A convenience sample of 224 Kuwait University undergraduates was recruited. Their ages ranged from 18 to 28 years. The Arabic version of the World Health Organization QOL scale-Brief (WHOQOL-Bref), along with six self-rating scales of physical health, mental health, happiness, satisfaction with life, religiosity, and strength of religious belief were used. The test-retest reliabilities of all the scales ranged between 0.72 and 0.88, indicating good temporal stability. All the correlations of the scales with criteria were significant and ranged from 0.39 to 0.65 indicating from acceptable to good criterion-related validity. RESULTS: Sex-related differences were significant favoring men in nine out of the 13 scales. All the 66 correlations but two were significant and positive. The principal components analysis followed by varimax orthogonal rotation yielded two factors: \"Quality of life and well-being\" and \"Religiosity\". CONCLUSIONS: Based on the significant and positive correlations between QOL, SWB, and religiosity, it was concluded that religiosity may be considered as a salient component of, and a contributing factor to, QOL among this sample of Muslim college students. Therefore, Islamic beliefs and practices may have the potential to be integrated in the psychotherapeutic procedures among Muslim clients.1133-1143Oct 2010http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/205859882010-11-15 20:09:10Quality of Life Research: An International Journal of Quality of Life Aspects of Treatment, Care and Rehabilitation198Qual Life ResDOI 10.1007/s11136-010-9676-7ISSN 1573-2649journalArticle de GuzmanAllan B.

However, despite the established relationship of spirituality and health, there had been little evidence of ways of assessing spirituality for nurses' clinical practice in Asia, particularly in regard to geriatric patients. This study aimed to establish an eiditic description of a selected group of Filipino elderly's concept of, distance from, and involvement with God. The goal was to strengthen the need for a holistic care delivery framework anchored on the recognition of spiritual well-being among geriatric patients. Seven Filipino geriatrics suffering from chronic illness participated voluntarily as respondents for this qualitative study. A three-part researcher-made instrument was used in eliciting the needed data and information. The first part of data gathering made use of a robotfoto to establish the demographic profile of the respondents. Doodling was utilized to ascertain the respondents' concept of God. Distance from God was assessed through a picture prompt presenting a seat plan in a theatre. A semistructured interview was employed to probe deeper into the respondents' involvement with God. Field texts were phenomenologically reduced via repertory grid and dendogram. The study has eiditically and interestingly surfaced the Filipino elderly's twin concept of God as creating and creative. Generally, the respondents' preferred a close distance from God to facilitate better understanding and higher concentration with God's words.

Research assistants administered a questionnaire developed to assess CAM use in primary care to a convenience sample of patients attending seven primary care clinics. Results. Of the 3742 respondents, 485 (12.9%) reported having Type 2 diabetes. Respondents with diabetes reported more overall CAM use during the previous year (46.9% vs. 42%, P=0.049). A logistic regression model of patients with diabetes Type 2 indicated that CAM use was associated with higher self-assessed religiosity [Exp(B)=1.898, 95% CI for Exp(B) 1.02-3.529, P=0.043]. CAM use among patients with diabetes was also associated more with female gender, higher education, and age under 60. The positive association between CAM use and degree of self-assessed religiosity was further studied in sub-populations of Jewish and Arab patients with diabetes Type 2. A logistic regression model of the Jewish population indicated significant association between CAM use and higher religiosity [Exp(B)=3.668, 95% CI for Exp(B) 1.232-10.922, P=0.02]. Conclusion. Primary care physicians need to be aware of a possible association between religiosity and CAM use in patients with diabetes. Physicians may consider adding questions on CAM and religiosity to routine clinical interviews in order to enrich their dialog with diabetes patients. [ABSTRACT FROM a healthcare intervention: A systematic reviewBackground Mindfulness may be viewed as a supra-cognitive state of consciousness focussed on the decentred, objective and compassionate observation of transient mental and physical phenomena that may be attained through meditation practices. Mindfulness meditation is thought to be beneficial in the management of various physical and mental health conditions.Objective To assess the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation practice as a healthcare intervention.Methods Systematic computerised and hand literature searches for randomised controlled trials and evaluation using methodological quality criteria.Results The higher quality studies analysed in this review have demonstrated replicated statistically significant improvements in spirituality and positive health measures and decreases in depressive relapse, depressive recurrence and psychological distress.Conclusions Despite the lack of specific, reliable and validated mindfulness measures, mindfulness shows potential as a positive healthcare intervention and continued investigation is warranted. Further research using improved methodology and utilising specific mindfulness outcome measures in trials with long-term follow up, larger populations and a wider demographic range is recommended.56-66June 2010Mindfulness meditation practise as a Self-Discovery: Ayurveda Trainees in BritainThis paper examines the backgrounds and motivations of persons trained or training as Ayurvedic practitioners at two London-based institutions offering Ayurveda programmes at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. It draws upon in-depth interviews with individuals at various stages of their training and practice in order to examine the paths that bring them to Ayurveda, their motivations for undergoing training, and the ways in which they apply their knowledge of Ayurveda during and after their training period. The findings here corroborate what other scholars have demonstrated in the case of Asian traditions like Yoga and Ayurveda in the West; these traditions have inevitably undergone shifts in meaning by virtue of their assimilation into the Western, in this case British, holistic health milieu. Most significant in Ayurveda's case is the shift away from a preoccupation with remedial medicine (the bedrock of mainstream Ayurveda in modern South Asia), to a focus on self-knowledge and self-empowerment as a path to 'holistic healing' (understood to address mental and spiritual, not just physical, wellbeing). Even though the Ayurvedic curriculum transmitted at the educational institutions in London is based largely on that taught at Ayurveda colleges in India, the completely different orientations and dispositions of students in Britain (as compared to their South Asian counterparts) ensures that the Ayurveda they go on to apply and practise is radically different - this is 'spiritualised' Ayurveda, in radical contrast to the 'biomedicalised' version obtaining in modern mainstream South Asian contexts.423-451Jan approach to psychotherapy for Latina/osDevelopment of culturally syntonic models for treatment that are consistent with belief systems of ethnically diverse populations is at a beginning stage of evolution. This paper is a step toward laying a new conceptual and psychotherapeutic approach with Latina/o clients, specifically those of Mexican American and Mexican backgrounds. It is argued that a psychospiritual belief system is at the base of these populations, and that a culturally consistent framework must appropriately address theory, skills, and practice. Mestizo spirituality is presented and described, and a review of those forces that have impacted this understanding is offered. Key concepts, therapeutic goals, and relationship assumptions of the model, two case examples, application, and limitations of this framework are provided. Lastly, implications for professional practice are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, medicine has emerged as a potential solution to the American healthcare crisis. It provides care that is patient centered, healing oriented, emphasizes the therapeutic relationship, and uses therapeutic approaches originating from conventional and alternative medicine. Initially driven by consumer demand, the attention integrative medicine places on understanding whole persons and assisting with lifestyle change is now being recognized as a strategy to address the epidemic of chronic diseases bankrupting our economy. This paper defines integrative medicine and its principles, describes the history of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in American healthcare, and discusses the current state and desired future of integrative medical practice. The importance of patient-centered care, patient empowerment, behavior change, continuity of care, outcomes research, and the challenges to successful integration are discussed. The authors suggest a model for an integrative healthcare system grounded in team-based care. A primary health partner who knows the patient well, is able to addresses mind, body, and spiritual needs, and coordinates care with the help of a team of practitioners is at the centerpiece. Collectively, the team can meet all the health needs of the particular patient and forms the patient-centered medical home. The paper culminates with 10 recommendations directed to key actors to facilitate the systemic changes needed for a functional healthcare delivery system. Recommendations include creating financial incentives aligned with health promotion and prevention. Insurers are requested to consider the total costs of care, the potential cost effectiveness of lifestyle approaches and CAM modalities, and the value of longer office visits to develop a therapeutic relationship and stimulate behavioral change. Outcomes research to track the effectiveness of integrative models must be funded, as well as feedback and dissemination strategies. Additional competencies for primary health partners, including CAM and conventional medical providers, will need to be developed to foster successful integrative practices. Skills include learning to develop appropriate healthcare teams that function well in a medical home, developing an understanding of the diverse healing traditions, and enhancing communication skills. For integrative medicine to flourish in the United States, new providers, new provider models, and a realignment of incentives and a commitment to health promotion and disease management will be required.277-2892009 views on mental health and psychotherapyOBJECTIVES: The aim of this research was to explore with a heterogeneous Muslim population their understanding of the concept of mental health and how any mental distress experienced by an individual can best be addressed. DESIGN: A qualitative approach was taken. Participants were interviewed, and data analysed thematically. METHODS: A sample of 14 Muslims was interviewed according to a semi-structured interview schedule. Participants were recruited via electronic mailing lists, and communications with local Muslim organizations. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Thematic analysis identified seven operationalizing themes that were given highlight the interweaving of religious and secular perspectives on mental distress and responses to it. Potential barriers are discussed, as are the important characteristics of therapy, therapists, and service provision. Clinical implications are presented along with the limitations of this study and suggestions for future and scientific perspective on randomized controlled trialsReligious traditions across the world display beliefs in healing through prayer. The healing powers of prayer have been examined in triple-blind, randomized controlled trials. We illustrate randomized controlled trials on prayer and healing, with one study in each of different categories of outcome. We provide a critical analysis of the scientific and philosophical dimensions of such research. Prayer has been reported to improve outcomes in human as well as nonhuman species, to have no effect on outcomes, to worsen outcomes and to have retrospective healing effects. For a multitude of reasons, research on the healing effects of prayer is riddled with assumptions, challenges and contradictions that make the subject a scientific and religious minefield. We believe that the research has led nowhere, and that future research, if any, will forever be constrained by the scientific limitations that we outline.247-2532009 Oct-DecPrayer and 10.4103/0019-5545.58288ISSN 1998-3794<p>This article provides a critical analysis of three types of prayer studies on scientific (methodological) and philosophical grounds and concludes that any future research into the effectiveness of prayer in healing will inevitably run up against spirituality: coping strategy or health seeking behavior hindrance?We explored the role of religiosity and spirituality on (i) feelings and attitudes about breast cancer, (ii) strategies for coping with breast cancer, and (iii) health care seeking behaviors among breast cancer survivors in Iran. We conducted in-depth semistructured interviews with 39 breast cancer survivors. We found that spirituality is the primary source of psychological support among participants. Almost all participants attributed their cancer to the will of God. Despite this, they actively have been engaged with their medical treatment. This is in surprising contrast to Western cultures in which a belief in an external health locus of control diminishes participation in cancer screening, detection, and treatment. These findings can help researchers to provide a framework for the development of appropriate and effective culturally sensitive health interventions.88-98Jan 2010Muslim breast cancer survivor spirituality2010-04-25 21:33:39NCBI International311Health Care HorriganBonnie J. PechuraConstance Efficacy and Cost Effectiveness of Integrative Medicine: A Review of the Medical and Corporate LiteratureData supporting the efficacy and cost effectiveness of an integrative approach to healthcare comes from three sources: medical research conducted at universities, studies carried out by corporations developing employee wellness programs, and pilot projects run by insurance companies. The integrative approaches being studied place the patient at the center of the care and address the full range of physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and environmental influences that affect a person's health. Most importantly, they promote prevention by engaging the whole person in the attainment of a personalized lifestyle that supports health. A review of the medical, corporate, and payer literature reveals that, to start, immediate and significant health benefits and cost savings could be realized throughout our healthcare system by utilizing three integrative strategies: (1) integrative lifestyle change programs for those with chronic disease, (2) integrative interventions for people experiencing depression, and (3) integrative preventive strategies to support wellness in all populations.308-312September 2010The Efficacy and Cost J When do nurses refer patients to professional chaplains?Nursing has historically realized the importance of spirituality in patient care, and more than other healthcare staff, they also have recognized the integral role of chaplains in meeting the spiritual needs of patients. The present study examines specific patient and family issues for which nurses make referrals to chaplains. A previously piloted questionnaire asking how often nurses and allied staff refer patients to chaplains was distributed to 133 staff members at a New York area hospital, the majority of whom were registered nurses (RNs). ANOVA revealed significant differences with respect to the kinds of issues that nurses are likely to refer to chaplains, with referrals being most likely for family issues and least likely for treatment-related issues. A significant interaction between staff type (nurses vs allied staff) and issues was also found. The results are discussed in relation to the nurses' desire to meet patients' spiritual needs and how be achieved.44-482010 Jan-Feb2010-01-24 22:16:45NCBI PubMedPMID: 20023523journalArticle BenturNetta ResnizkyShirli Challenges and achievements the development of spiritual-care training and implementation in Israel.In recent years, pioneering spiritual-care training programs and services have been developed in Israel. This paper examines the implementation of the training programs and the challenge of integrating program graduates in the healthcare services. The information was collected through in-depth interviews with 12 students and graduates and the directors of the three training programs. All the interviews were transcribed in full and analyzed using qualitative study methods. The interviewees emphasized the importance of practical experience, although many of them encountered some degree of antagonism during their training or placement. Continuation of personal counseling and supervision after the conclusion of the program is also essential. Some were worried that they would not find work or were concerned about negotiations with potential employers. Evidently, the implementation of spiritual-care education must continue apace and careful consideration be given to optimizing its acceptance by the establishment. [ABSTRACT Relationship of Nursing Students' Spiritual Care Perspectives to Their Expressions of Spiritual EmpathyGuided by Chism's Middle-Range Theory of Spiritual Empathy, the overarching purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which nursing students' spiritual care perspectives account for their expressions of spiritual empathy. In this descriptive correlational study, spiritual care perspectives accounted for 8.6% of the variance in nursing students' (N = 223) expressions of spiritual empathy after controlling for relevant demographic and spirituality variables. Findings of the study suggest that the provision of spiritual care in nursing practice depends, in part, on nurses clarifying their own spiritual care perspectives.597-605Jul 30, 2009http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/196506102009-09-26 of integrated yoga practices on immune responses in examination stress - A preliminary studyBACKGROUND Stress is often associated with an increased occurrence of autonomic, cardiovascular, and immune system pathology. This study was done to evaluate the impact of stress on psychological, physiological parameters, and immune system during medical term -academic examination and the effect of yoga practices on the same. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was carried out on sixty first-year MBBS students randomly assigned to yoga group and control group (30 each). The yoga group underwent integrated yoga practices for 35 minutes daily in the presence of trained yoga teacher for 12 weeks. Control group did not undergo any kind of yoga practice or stress management. Physiological parameters like heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were measured. Global Assessment of Recent Stress Scale and Spielbergers State Anxiety score were assessed at baseline and during the examination. Serum cortisol levels, IL-4, and IFN- levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. RESULT In the yoga group, no significant difference was observed in physiological parameters during the examination stress, whereas in the control group, a significant increase was observed. Likewise, the indicators of psychological stress showed highly significant difference in control group compared with significant difference in yoga group. During the examination, the increase in serum cortical and decrease in serum IFN- in yoga group was less significant (P<0.01) than in the control group (P<0.001). Both the groups demonstrated an increase in serum IL-4 levels, the changes being insignificant for the duration of the study. CONCLUSION Yoga resists the autonomic changes and impairment of cellular immunity seen in examination stress.26-32Jan 2011http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/216549722011-07-13 HiggoRobert Spirituality and the threat to therapeutic boundaries in psychiatric practice.There is a determined campaign to make exploration of patients' spiritual experience an intrinsic and necessary part of routine psychiatric care. This has support from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, though there has been no consultation with psychiatrists. Whilst many of the proposals are uncontroversial, some involve serious breaches of normal professional boundaries of behaviour as set out in General Medical Council guidance. The contentious proposals are that a spiritual history should be taken from all patients, even where they resist; that it is sometimes acceptable to pray with patients; and that clinicians should support 'healthy' religious beliefs and challenge 'unhealthy' ones. The proposals are based on a model of universal spirituality which, we argue, is culture bound and lacks neutrality. This paper explores these issues and the consequences that might flow from altering professional boundaries in psychiatry. We conclude that the changes are unnecessary and should be resisted. [ABSTRACT FROM alternative medicine for psoriasis: A qualitative review of the clinical trial literatureBackground Patients with psoriasis often inquire about complementary and alternative medicine in an effort to do everything possible to control the disease.Objective We sought to review the clinical trial literature regarding complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of psoriasis.Methods We conducted qualitative systematic review of randomized, clinical trials.Results Although many randomized controlled trials were found, both the results and the quality of the studies varied.Limitations The main limitations were the relatively low quality of studies (as assessed by Jadad scores), lack of inclusion of unpublished studies, and the fact that only one author determined inclusion of studies and assignment of Jadad scores.Conclusion There is a large body of literature in regard to complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of psoriasis. More work is necessary before these modalities should be recommended to our patients.841-856November 2009Complementary and alternative medicine for psoriasishttp://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.bu.edu/science/article/B6WM8-4WXXV37-3/2/86fd5b1a427cc1eb59b823c687578c2f2009-11-24 01:56:35ScienceDirectJournal of the Sci consciousness and timeless transcendent presenceSpace consciousness is emerging as significant and necessary for the evolution of humanity according to spiritual teacher, Eckhart Tolle. Through space consciousness people become aware that we are timeless transcendent presence. This awareness is pronounced when with those who are living dying and their close others who are deeply grieving. Space consciousness and transcendent timeless presence in the context of living dying and deeply grieving are explored using nurse theorists' works in dialogue with Tolle's teachings.195-200Jul 20102010-07-07 an APN perspective using Roy's adaptation modelIntegration of the spiritual domain into the nursing plan of care positively influences health and wellness. Applying nursing theory to practice reinforces the advanced practice nurse's (APN's) responsibility to integrate spiritual care into the critical care environment. Indeed, all nurses have an obligation to integrate spiritual care because the focus of nursing care is beneficence. Moreover, the focus of APN care is not curing, but healing. Healing can be assisted by entering into the patient's suffering to help reconstruct life plans and facilitate realizing meaning from the despair of illness even while facing extreme adversity and death. This article describes spiritual care of the critically ill adult patient and the role that the APN must, can, and should take to assimilate spiritual care into care of these patients and their families.282-2912010 Jul-SepIntegrating spirituality into critical unitary human beingsThe universality of Rogers' science is discussed within the context of science and religion with an emphasis on an alive universe. Barrett's power theory is presented as an exemplar of the universality of Rogers' science. The implications of an alive universe are discussed. Rogers and Barrett are recognized for their contributions to nursing science and the sacred address patients' spiritual needs in practiceAlthough meeting patients' spiritual needs is important, many nurses are uncertain about what spiritual care involves and lack confidence in this area. This second article in a two part series on spirituality considers ways of addressing spiritual needs and provides an overview of the principles of assessment and implementation. Part 1 explored definitions of spirituality, the difference between religion and spirituality, and finding meaning in illness.23-252010 Jul 27-Aug 2Spirituality. 22010-08-30 1466-769X PesutBarbara Ontologies of nursing in an age of spiritual pluralism: closed or open worldview?North American society has undergone a period of sacralization where ideas of spirituality have increasingly been infused into the public domain. This sacralization is particularly evident in the nursing discourse where it is common to find claims about the nature of persons as inherently spiritual, about what a spiritually healthy person looks like and about the environment as spiritually energetic and interconnected. Nursing theoretical thinking has also used claims about the nature of persons, health, and the environment to attempt to establish a unified ontology for the discipline. However, despite this common ground, there has been little discussion about the intersections between nursing philosophic thinking and the spirituality in nursing discourse, or about the challenges of adopting a common view of these claims within a spiritually pluralist society. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the call for ontological unity within nursing philosophic thinking in the context of the sacralization of a diverse society. I will begin with a discussion of secularization and sacralization, illustrating the diversity of beliefs and experiences that characterize the current trend towards sacralization. I will then discuss the challenges of a unified ontological perspective, or closed world view, for this diversity, using examples from both a naturalistic and a unitary perspective. I will conclude by arguing for a unified approach within nursing ethics rather than nursing ontology.15-23Jan 2010Ontologies of nursing in an age of spiritual pluralism2010-01-24 22:17:29NCBI PubMedPMID: 20017879journalArticle JeswaniMamta FurnhamAdrian Are modern health worries, environmental concerns, or paranormal beliefs associated with perceptions of the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine?OBJECTIVE: To investigate to what extent paranormal beliefs, modern health worries (MHWs), and environmental concerns were related to beliefs about, and behaviour associated with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). METHODS: Of the participants, 150 completed a four-part questionnaire measuring use and perception of CAM, MHWs, paranormal beliefs, and environmental concerns. RESULTS: A factor analysis on the CAM questions revealed three clear components, labelled efficacy of CAM, attitudes to CAM, and safety of CAM. Age, total MHWs, paranormal beliefs, and environmental concerns were used as predictor variables in regression analyses with efficacy as criterion variable. Age was found to be a significantly related to efficacy of CAM. When total MHW score, paranormal belief score, and environmental concern score were added to the model, the r(2) increased by 29%. Environmental concern did not significantly relate to efficacy but spiritualism beliefs did. A factor analysis of the MHW scale items revealed nine factors. Out of these, radiation, doctors playing God, disasters, and epidemics, as well as harmful rays and air contaminants significantly predict belief in the efficacy of CAM. CONCLUSION: Overall, older people, with more MHWs, and who believe in the paranormal are more likely to believe that CAM works, possibly because of a more intuitive, 'holistic', thinking style. Limitations of the study are considered.599-609Sep 20102010-10-07 00:45:55NCBI PubMedPMID: LundbergPranee C KerdonfagPetcharat Spiritual care provided by Thai nurses in intensive care unitsAim. The aim of this study was to explore how Thai nurses in intensive care units of a university hospital in Bangkok provided spiritual care to their patients.Background. The function of nursing is to promote health, prevent illness, restore health and alleviate suffering. An holistic approach to this promotion includes spirituality.Design. An explorative qualitative study was used.Method. Thirty Thai nurses, selected through purposive sampling with the snowball technique, participated voluntarily. Semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions were carried out, taped-recorded, transcribed verbatim and subjected to content analysis.Results. Five themes related to the provision of spiritual care emerged: giving mental support, facilitating religious rituals and cultural beliefs, communicating with patients and patients' families, assessing the spiritual needs of patients and showing respect and facilitating family participation in care. Several ways of improving the spiritual care were suggested by the nurses.Conclusions. Spirituality was an important part of the care for the nurses when meeting the needs of their patients and the patients' families. Therefore, nursing education should enhance nurses' understanding and awareness of spiritual issues and prepare them to respond to human spiritual needs.Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses should consider spirituality as an important component of holistic care. During their professional career, they should expand their knowledge and understanding of spirituality and develop tools for assessment of spiritual needs.1121-112820102010-05-08 22:02:58Wiley InterSciencejournalArticleMental Health, 1367-4676 RaffayJulian Training the workforce in spiritual healthcareA systems approach to training staff in spiritual healthcare is advocated and six essential principles are suggested.

The probable cause of civilization diseases and the structural limits of pleasureSummary This article provides a theoretical basis and experimental evidence for the following rules: (1) All mental activities involving some level of intelligence ultimately follow the laws of operant conditioning and can exert a long-term control of behaviour only if they regularly provide the midbrain centres with the minimal set of neural rewards that these centres expect (2) Mental activity is always accompanied by a proportional amount of efferent-controlled physiological activity, which may be, for example, voluntary muscular work, but also internal, possibly surreptitious phenomena like inflammation, immune reactions, blood pressure increase, etc. These rules provide an explanation for most [`]civilization' diseases whose ultimate causes are currently unknown or uncontrollable, e.g. cardiovascular troubles, cancer, allergies, auto-immune disorders, non-congenital degenerative diseases, neural dysfunctions including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, ALS or multiple sclerosis, emotional troubles including depression, cyclothymic/bipolar disorders, uncontrollable compulsions, etc. Potentially, this explanation also provides a cure for all these diseases as long as there is no accumulation of many of them because, for example, of very advanced age, and only if we are ready to adopt a philosophy of happiness based on moderation and appreciation of the value of life, dignity and empathy, instead of attempting an unlimited accumulation of pleasure, which does not seem neurologically viable.838-842November AnthropologyCATHOLICSChristiansMENTAL illness -- TreatmentPsychiatryPsychotherapyspiritualityTHERAPEUTICSvirtueFoundations for a Psychotherapy of Virtue: An Integrated Catholic Perspective.This article discusses the possibility of founding a psychotherapy of virtue on a Roman Catholic anthropology and on an Aristotelian-Thomist virtue theory. We explore the common ground, the diversity, and the therapeutic pathways in a life of virtue. The common ground is rooted in the normativeness of human nature according to cognitive, volitional, emotional, and relational domains, where we find the basic virtue areas identified in the cardinal and theological virtues. The diversity is manifest at the level of human development in which associated virtue strengths and supporting practices are historically and culturally embedded. The therapeutic pathways revisit these levels with a goal of healing. It is argued that the therapeutic process must prioritize attention to emotional wounds to stabilize the foundation for growth in the capacity to become free and responsible agents. In addition, for clients who bring an intention to employ Christian spiritual resources, this psychotherapy concurrently seeks not only symptom reduction and the development of acquired virtue strengths and practices, but also the concomitant development of spiritual ones.

There has been no literature review that explores only UK literature, and this article updates a literature review carried out in 2006 (Ross, 2006). Aim: The review was designed to investigate the current nursing evidence underpinning the concept of spirituality and its application. Method: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken and a thematic analysis performed following a search for literature using defined dates, databases and search terms. Results: Four major themes emerged from the literature: concept clarification; spiritual care-giving; religion and spirituality; and nurse education. Conclusion: Definitions of spiritual care vary, and the concept of spirituality in nursing is still under development. However, until a common language of spirituality is developed, models of spiritual care developed through research involving mainly nursing staff will be difficult for nurses to apply.743-7492011 Jun 24-Jul 7Spirituality in Press GriffithJames Religion for practice2010ISBN and the (Im)possibilities of Articulating SpiritualityDespite growing interest in spiritual matters throughout society, definitions and descriptions of spirituality seem incomplete or otherwise unsatisfactory. In this article, the authors consider the possibility that such incompleteness is perhaps necessary and welcomed in addressing spirituality. In particular, they investigate the challenges of using metaphor and metonymic approaches to \"languaging\" spirituality. By exploring these figures of speech they hope to diversify how nurses articulate deeply personal and perhaps enigmatic human phenomena such as spirituality. Metaphoric language uses everyday structures to help make sense of complex, emotional, and abstract experience. Whereas metaphor creates substitutive relationships between things and provides insights into conceptualizing spirituality, metonymy and metonymic writing establish relationships of contiguity. Whereas metaphor functions to represent and facilitates understanding and feelings about spirituality, metonymy disrupts while opening possibilities of moving beyond binary thinking. Attending to language and its various ontological assumptions opens diverse and potentially more inclusive possibilities.44-52Mar 2011http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/208413922011-04-04 23:48:36NCBI PubMedPMID: 20841392Journal of Holistic training in spiritual care: a qualitative study exploring patient perceptions of professional educational requirementsHealthcare professionals express difficulties in delivering spiritual care, despite it being a core component of palliative care national policies. The patient perspective on professional training to address difficulties has not previously been sought. The aim of this study is to describe patient suggestions for development of training to deliver spiritual care. Qualitative semi-structured in-depth 'palliative patient' interviews (n = 20) were analysed thematically. Training suggestions encompassed practical care delivery. Patients supported staff who introduced questions about spiritual needs, and they expected opportunities to engage in spiritual care discussions. The 'right' attitude for spiritual care delivery was defined as being non-judgemental, providing integrated care and showing interest in individuals. Training issues included patient perspectives of boundaries between personal and professional roles. This study provides 'palliative patient' perspectives to strengthen recommended models of spiritual care delivery. It shows that user opinions on training can be helpful not only in deciding objectives but also how to achieve them.601-607Oct 2009Improving training in spiritual carehttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/194435212009-11-05 03:04:33NCBI PubMedPMID: StatesSpirituality, religion, and clinical careInterest in the relationship between spirituality, religion, and clinical care has increased in the last 15 years, but clinicians need more concrete guidance about this topic. This article defines spirituality and religion, identifies the fundamental spiritual issues that serious illness raises for patients, and argues that physicians have a moral obligation to address patients' spiritual concerns. Religions often provide patients with specific moral guidance about a variety of medical issues and prescribe rituals that are important to patients. Religious coping can be both positive and negative, and it can impact patient care. This article provides concrete advice about taking a spiritual history, ethical boundaries, whether to pray with patients, and when to refer patients to chaplains or to their three main monotheistic religions and GM food technology: an overview of perspectivesABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Public acceptance of genetically modified crops is partly rooted in religious views. However, the views of different religions and their potential influence on consumers' decisions have not been systematically examined and summarized in a brief overview. We review the positions of the Judaism, Islam and Christianity - the three major monotheistic religions to which more than 55% of humanity adheres to - on the controversies aroused by GM technology. DISCUSSION: The article establishes that there is no overarching consensus within the three religions. Overall, however, it appears that mainstream theology in all three religions increasingly tends towards acceptance of GM technology per se, on performing GM research, and on consumption of GM foods. These more liberal approaches, however, are predicated on there being rigorous scientific, ethical and regulatory scrutiny of research and development of such products, and that these products are properly labeled. SUMMARY: We conclude that there are several other interests competing with the influence exerted on consumers by religion. These include the media, environmental activists, scientists and the food industry, all of which function as sources of information and shapers of perception for consumers.182009The three main monotheistic religions and gm food technologyhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/196981182009-10-27 13:57:25NCBI PubMedPMID: 19698118BMC International and Human Rights9BMC Int Health Hum RightsDOI 10.1186/1472-698X-9-18ISSN 1472-698XjournalArticleAmerican Journal of Medical Genetics.

We surveyed 480 clinical geneticists (MDs), genetic counselors (GCs), and genetic nurses randomly selected from their professional associations, and then interviewed a sample of survey respondents. Outcomes included religiosity, coping with distress through spiritual beliefs, and personal value conflicts (PVCs). Two hundred fourteen providers completed the survey out of an estimated 348 eligible (61% response rate). Importance attributed to regular attendance at religious services ranged from 39% (not at all important) to 27% (very important). Reliance on religion and spiritual beliefs as a source of comfort ranged from 48% (never) to 33% (sometimes or often). Religiosity varied by discipline with 58% of nurses thinking regular attendance at religious services was moderately or very important as compared to 47% of GCs and 30% of MDs (P = 0.006). Ten percent of respondents had difficulty reconciling their own faith with being a genetics professional, 14% felt the need to hide their own faith from their colleagues or patients, 7% thought their professional stance was not consistent with their personal values, and 4% felt ostracized by the genetics community because of their personal beliefs. The experience of such PVCs was positively correlated with religiosity (r = 0.35; P < 0.0001). GCs were more likely to experience PVCs than MDs or nurses (P = 0.013). Data from the interviews (N = 54) support these findings. A significant minority of genetic service providers are religiously observant and rely on their religious values to cope with distress. These individuals often experience difficulty reconciling their religious beliefs with the expectations of their profession, and sharing their beliefs with their colleagues and patients. Efforts should be made to prevent or reduce the secrecy surrounding personal faith and religion among genetics professionals.31-40Feb 15, 20092011-02-23 00:56:48NCBI PubMedPMID: 19170100journalArticle RiceSue Ethical Views and Usages of Spiritually Influenced InterventionsSocial work practice takes many different forms, depending on purpose and context. An increased diversity in fields and methods of practice has driven the need to explore the intersection between acceptable standards of practice and issues pertaining to religion and spirituality. This discussion utilises the opportunity to co-report on the findings of a selection of similar questions gathered from two independent online survey studies, conducted one year apart, with members of the Australian Association of Social Workers. One study explored attitudes and behaviours about ethical conduct, and the other investigated the role of religion and spirituality in social work practice. Findings from the questions in common, about the acceptability and practice of spiritually-influenced forms of intervention, are presented. These indicate a degree of acceptance, conditional acceptance, and usage for some interventions, and clear non-acceptance and non-usage of others. Implications for ethical thinking in practice, education, and research are explored.403-420Sept. 2009Ethics of a message for faith leaders: encouraging community health promotion with local health dataThis study reports the use of a community-based health survey to share local health information with faith leaders. Geographical information systems software identified survey respondents within 2 km (1.25 miles) of places of worship. Results were tabulated for the community surrounding each place of worship and were compared with city- and county-level data. Faith leaders were presented with community-specific reports describing the health attributes of residents who lived in the surrounding area, in order to assist with the identification issues of concern and opportunities to develop health ministries to address these issues. Faith leaders were encouraged to share this information with members of their faith community and develop means of obtaining additional information on the people of interest. We believe that engaging faith leaders with neighborhood-specific health information will be critical in providing an understanding of the importance of their voice in improving health outcomes of their faith community, the surrounding neighborhood, and the community at large. Our goal is to empower faith leaders to understand personal and community health issues and to act as a conduit for health-related information and health promotion at a local level.

CI helps the individuals with an artificial stoma to adjust to the stoma and may increase their quality of life (QOL). An uncontrolled intestinal gas discharge invalidates ablution, and noisy gas discharge and smell prevents congregational prayers, which cause problems to Muslims with stomas. Therefore, CI may be an appropriate solution for this patient group. Using the example of one affected individual we discuss how the praying problem can be resolved with teaching to self-perform CI and emphasize the beneficial effects on QOL.1189-11902009Colostomy irrigationhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/201926092011-03-28 22:18:24NCBI PubMedPMID: 20192609Asian Pacific us make us a name\": reflections on the future of the religion and health fieldAfter years of marginality, research on religion and health is entering the academic mainstream. Scholarship on this topic has evolved into a large, productive field. As in any emerging field, there are competing visions for what the field should be about and what research questions should be pursued. Different opinions exist as to which constructs should be researched. Words like religion, spirituality, faith, and prayer, and health, healing, medicine, and healthcare, imply different things. The study of their various interconnections can thus take myriad forms. This article argues for a welcoming approach open to the widest range of research subjects.125-145Jun 2009\"And let us spiritual needs should be incorporated into nursing care is supported by literature and policy.222009 Jun 10-162011-02-22 23:47:29NCBI PubMedPMID: 19579370Nursing EvaluationResearchCurriculum for a Spiritual Pathway Project: integrating research methodology into pastoral care trainingIn the immediate future Chaplains will need to practice evidence based spiritual care.

Given some prominence in the media, this campaign seems to aim at having CAM courses scrutinized, CAM treatments taken off reimbursement schemes, and brandishing doctors and academics dealing with CAM as quacks. The buzzword used is \"evidence-based,\" with the presupposition that, while conventional medicine is \"evidence-based,\" CAM is not. It is worthwhile to examine the notion of \"evidence\" used in this discussion. I argue that it is a rather unwholesome type of evidence that is referred to here, namely only the difference between an active treatment and a sham treatment. For several reasons this is too restricted and not sound, as it creates several paradoxes, for instance the efficacy paradox. This consists in what is now empirically documented, whereas a CAM placebo can be actually more effective than a conventional, supposedly evidence-based, treatment. This shows that the discussion is really about something completely different: CAM has become a real player in the health services field, threatening revenues of the pharmaceutical industry. Taken together with a series of events this suggests that this campaign is carefully staged. It requires that we take the question of what \"evidence\" means to the heart of the methodological discussion, also for the sake of a broader, more wholesome notion of what counts as evidence. It also requires that we keep producing good data with a broad enough outlook comparing CAM treatments with conventional ones, and not just of nursing presenceThis article addresses nursing presence, a phenomenon essential to holistic nursing care. The concept is introduced and explained, supporting background information is reviewed, barriers are identified, and successful applications are illustrated in different clinical settings. Avowing that metaphysical knowledge is the underpinning to the art of nursing presence, a Transformative Nursing Presence Model is offered as a distinctive framework for nurses and organizations interested in fostering enhanced nursing presence.447-459Dec 2009Healing during existential momentshttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/198501812009-12-28 17:14:52NCBI Spirituality: A Barrier and a Bridge in the Everyday Professional Work of Pediatric PhysiciansWe investigate how 30 pediatricians and pediatric oncologists who practice and teach at elite medical centers determine whether religion and spirituality are relevant to what Andrew Abbot (1988) calls their professional \"jurisdictions.\" Through in-depth interviews we focus on their everyday interactions with patients and families. We ask: (1) How do they gather information about religion and spirituality and determine when that information is relevant to their professional work? (2) Do they perceive religion and spirituality to be a barrier or a bridge to medical care as they do what Thomas Gieryn (1983) calls \"boundary work\"? We find that pediatric oncologists more than pediatricians see religion and spirituality as relevant to their professional work, though still largely outside their professional jurisdiction. It is most relevant when families are making medical decisions and in end of life situations. Physicians tend to view religion and spirituality functionally, describing impermeable boundaries in medical decision making situations and more permeable boundaries at the end of life. Physicians view religion and spirituality as a barrier when it impedes medical recommendations and as a bridge when it helps families answer questions medicine inherently cannot. Such findings have implications for a wide range of professionals as they negotiate their jurisdictions, particularly around religion and spirituality, in everyday practice.702-721NOV 2009Religion body dissatisfaction and cosmetic rhinoplasty with levels of veil practicing in Islamic womenOBJECTIVE The relationship between Islamic veiling, body dissatisfaction, and desire for cosmetic rhinoplasty (CR) has not been studied. We therefore compared body dissatisfaction (BD), depression, self-esteem, and prevalence and desire to have CR in 1,771 Iranian females. METHOD A battery of questionnaires was administered and participants were categorized into three groups of Islamic veil practicing: voluntarily and ideologically (IVP), non-complete (NCIVP), Despite a BMI, the IVP group scored significantly lower on BD, prevalence of dieting and exercising in order to be sexually appealing, and depression, higher on self-esteem, and had a lower desire for a CR than the two other groups. Prevalence of CR was significantly higher in the IIVP group than the other groups. DISCUSSION Women who practiced more strict Islamic veiling techniques had increased body satisfaction and self esteem, and decreased depression scores and desire for CR. Consistent with other studies, our findings show that observance of a strict religious practice has a protective effect on psychological health.339-345May 2009http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/191153732011-03-28 22:18:24NCBI PubMedPMID: 19115373The rheumatologyThe State of Research on Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Pediatric RheumatologyThis article reviews available evidence on complementary and alternative medicine in pediatric rheumatology. Despite its common use in pediatric rheumatology (34%-92%), there is still uncertainty as to its efficacy and safety. Although results are promising for some treatments such as massage, acupuncture, mind-body interventions (eg, guided imagery and meditative breathing), and some natural health products (eg, calcium supplements and Tripterygium wilfordii), there is a need for high-quality trials investigating the long-term effects and underlying mechanisms of these therapies as well as research on their use in this population of patients.85-94February 20112011-03-15 18:51:57ScienceDirectRheumatic Disease Clinics of nurses' experiences of delivering spiritual care to patients in an Irish hospiceThis study aims to describe nurses' experiences of delivering spiritual support in a palliative care setting in the Republic of Ireland. The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 nurses working in the area of specialist palliative care. A content analysis of the transcriptions revealed five sub-themes: understanding spirituality; the art of nursing in spiritual care; education and learning; the challenge of spiritual caring; and the dimensions of time. The resulting creation of a spiritual tapestry provided an overall theme. Nurses in this study were spiritually self-aware and placed a high value on the spiritual element of their caring role. Nurses described their individual understanding of spirituality and discussed how they recognized and addressed a patient's spiritual needs. Time was described as essential to the provision of spiritual support and appeared to be a significant resource challenge to the provision of spiritual care. The challenges of assessing spiritual needs and measuring outcomes of care were also reported. Participants in this study described the creation of a spiritual tapestry that 'weaves' together care and compassion with skills and knowledge in their nursing practice.42-48Jan 2009Creating spiritual retreat on nurses' spirituality: a randomized controlled studyThis study tested whether two 1-day retreats focused on spiritual self-care would positively change nurse participants' spirituality. A total of 199 critical care nurses were accepted into this study; 87 were randomized to receive the retreat intervention. All 199 nurses were tested preretreat, 1 month and 6 months postretreat. Retreat participants demonstrated increased spirituality.125-1332010 May-JunThe effect neurofeedback, creative performance enhancement, long distance functional connectivity and psychological integrationProfessionally significant enhancement of music and dance performance and mood has followed training with an EEG-neurofeedback protocol which increases the ratio of theta to alpha waves using auditory feedback with eyes closed. While originally the protocol was designed to induce hypnogogia, a state historically associated with creativity, the outcome was psychological integration, while subsequent applications focusing on raising the theta-alpha ratio, reduced depression and anxiety in alcoholism and resolved post traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). In optimal performance studies we confirmed associations with creativity in musical performance, but effects also included technique and communication. We extended efficacy to dance and social anxiety. Diversity of outcome has a counterpart in wide ranging associations between theta oscillations and behaviour in cognitive and affective neuroscience: in animals with sensory-motor activity in exploration, effort, working memory, learning, retention and REM sleep; in man with meditative concentration, reduced anxiety and sympathetic autonomic activation, as well as task demands in virtual spatial navigation, focussed and sustained attention, working and recognition memory, and having implications for synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation. Neuroanatomical circuitry involves the ascending mescencephalic-cortical arousal system, and limbic circuits subserving cognitive as well as affective/motivational functions. Working memory and meditative bliss, representing cognitive and affective domains, respectively, involve coupling between frontal and posterior cortices, exemplify a role for theta and alpha waves in mediating the interaction between distal and widely distributed connections. It is posited that this mediation in part underpins the integrational attributes of alpha-theta training in optimal performance and psychotherapy, creative associations in hypnogogia, and enhancement of technical, communication and artistic domains of performance in Kate NarayanasamyAru An investigation into the role of spirituality in nursingThis article examines spirituality in nursing in terms of a critical literature review. The literature suggests that there is an increasing demand for holistic care within the NHS. Holistic care is based on the idea that there should be a balance between body, mind and spirit, however, clinical experience suggests that the spiritual dimension of nursing is rarely considered as there is a focus on what is perceived as scientific professionalism. The aim of this article is to explore the nature of spiritual care, discuss whether there is a need for it in nursing and explore ways in which nurses can provide it. This article is based on a critical review of the literature and empirical data on spirituality in nursing and identifies contrasting opinions around the definition of spiritual nursing care. Nurses can provide spiritual care by being conscious of their own spirituality as well as that of patients.886-890July 20092009-09-18 22:31:56NCBI PubMedPMID: 19633601bookTheology in long-term yoga practitionersYoga represents a fascinating mind-body approach, wherein body movements (asana), breathing exercises (pranayama) and meditation are integrated into a single multidimensional practice. Numerous beneficial mental and physical effects have been classically ascribed to this holistic ancient method. The purpose of the present study has been to examine the effects of long-term yoga practice on Subjective Sleep Quality (SSQ) and on several hormonal parameters of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Twenty-six subjects (16 experimental and 10 controls) were recruited to be part of the study. Experimental subjects were regular yoga practitioners with a minimum of 3 years of practice. Blood samples for the quantification of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) were drawn from all subjects. Likewise, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was employed to assess SSQ. As statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. The yoga group displayed lower PSQI scores and higher blood cortisol levels than control subjects. Therefore, it can be concluded that long-term yoga practice is associated with significant psycho-biological differences, including better sleep quality as well as a modulatory action on the levels of cortisol.

Research focuses more on attitudinal questions about whether physicians and/or patients think prayer is relevant than on actual data about when and how prayer comes up in the clinic and how physicians respond. We focus on pediatric physicians to investigate: 1) how prayer enters clinical contexts and 2) how physicians respond. METHODS: We examined in-depth interviews with 30 academic pediatricians and pediatric oncologists. All of these physicians were employed by the most highly ranked hospitals according to US News and World Report. RESULTS: In close to 100% of cases when the subject of prayer came up in clinical contexts, it was patients and families who raised it. Patients and families mostly talked about prayer in response to a seriously ill or dying child. When it was raised, pediatric physicians responded to prayer by participating; accommodating but not participating; reframing; and directing families to other resources. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians wanted to respect patients and families around the topic of prayer. They negotiated between patient/family requests, the specific situation, and their own comfort levels to respond in one of four ways. Their four responses allowed researchers to generate hypotheses about the independent variables that influence how pediatric physicians respond to prayer. Asking how prayer actually came up in clinical situations rather than how patients and/or physicians thought it should be raised, better informs ongoing conversations about the significance of prayer in physician-patient interactions.1218-1221Dec a training method to enhance the skills of clinical social workersThe use of Zen Buddhist meditation in clinical practice has received specific attention from mental health disciplines in the West. A study was undertaken to examine the influence of a personal practice of Zen on the professional work of clinical social workers. Ten experienced clinical social workers who were long-term Zen practitioners were interviewed. Findings from this qualitative study suggest that Zen meditation has direct application to clinical social work in three areas: (1) cultivating Awareness, (2) enhancing Acceptance, and (3) nurturing Responsibility. This article reports on the findings in the area of Awareness. Awareness increases a social worker's focus on the present moment with the client, providing for a suspension of preconceived ideas about the client. Building on the view that social work is both art and science, the author proposes the use of Zen in the training of clinical social workers.462-4702009 May-JunZen practice2011-02-23 00:14:55NCBI MedicinespiritualityThe spiritual care by registered nurses on a maternal-infant unitPURPOSE: This study explores the spirituality, spiritual well-being (SWB), and spiritual care provision of registered nurses on a maternal-infant unit.

The aim of the present pilot study is, therefore, to find out if research on quality improvement of healthcare chaplaincy is emotionally distressing for patients. In connection with a questionnaire about quality improvement proceeding of healthcare chaplaincy, patients were asked subsequently to assess whether the completion of the questionnaire was emotionally distressing for them. A total of 91.89% of the 37 respondents said that the completion of the questionnaire was not or only slightly emotionally distressing for them.

Blood transfusion therapy plays a very important role as a disease-modifying strategy in severe SCD e.g. primary and secondary stroke prevention and other acute life-threatening complications such as acute chest infections and acute multi-organ failure. Blood transfusion, however, carries a number of risks including alloimmunisation. There is the need to increase the level of awareness and education about SCD and also to increase blood donation drive among affected communities. These communities are mostly ethnic minority populations who are recognised to have poor access to health care services. Due to the strong impact of religion on these populations, faith organisations may provide potential access for health promotion and interventions. METHODS: A literature search was conducted to find studies published between 1990-2008 aimed at examining the influence of religious leaders and faith organisations in health, with particular reference to haemoglobinopathies. RESULTS: Eleven studies were reviewed covering a variety of health interventions. The findings suggest that involvement of religious leaders and faith organisations in health related interventions improved the level of acceptance, participation and positive health outcomes within the faith communities. CONCLUSION: Religious leaders and faith organisations have the potential to influence health education, health promotion and positive health outcomes amongst members of their faith community. They also provide potential access to at-risk populations for increasing awareness about SCD, encouraging health service utilization and ethnic blood donor drives.62009The role of religious leaders and faith organisations Fellowship282J Christ NursISSN 0743-2550 StangCecily Wellelr Is intercessory prayer valid nursing intervention?Is the use of intercessory prayer (IP) in modern nursing a valid practice?

Over a 10-year period, I have observed, that in midst of a busy and increasingly overcrowded setting, nurses find time to provide spiritual care. Although this dimension of nursing practice is not explicitly labelled as spiritual care, it is apparent that interventions such as active listening, touch and ultimately connecting with the patient has, on most occasions, positive effects on the patient's spiritual dimension. Subsequently, this has provided the momentum to carry out a study on how nurses provide spiritual care, in an emergency setting. The findings revealed that participants regarded spiritual care to be an integral component of their role. In addition, participants reported that they derived positive personal outcomes from providing this aspect of nursing care. Nevertheless, although most participants would argue that spiritual care is central to nursing practice, concerns were expressed with regard to its provision, in the emergency of Mind-Body Therapies in Adults with Common Neurological ConditionsBackground: Over 40% of adults with common neurological conditions use complementary and alternative medicine, and mind-body therapies are the most commonly used form. Our objective was to describe mind-body use in adults with common neurological conditions. Methods: We compared mind-body use between adults with and without common neurological conditions (regular headaches, migraines, back pain with sciatica, strokes, dementia, seizures or memory loss) using the 2007 National Health Interview Survey of 23,393 sampled American adults. Results: Adults with common neurological conditions used mind-body therapies more frequently than those without (24.5 vs. 16.6%, p < 0.0001); differences persisted after adjustment. Deep breathing exercises, meditation and yoga were used most frequently. Nearly 70% of the adults with common neurological conditions did not discuss their mind-body use with their health care provider. Those with neurological conditions used mind-body therapies more than those without these conditions because of provider recommendation (26 vs. 13%) or because conventional treatments were perceived ineffective (12 vs. 4%) or too costly (7 vs. 2%), respectively. Conclusions: Mind-body therapies are used more frequently among adults with common neurological conditions, more often when conventional treatments were perceived ineffective. More research is warranted on the efficacy of mind-body use for common a noncompararive pilot studyINTRODUCTION: Yoga is practiced both in developing and developed countries. Many patients and yoga protagonists claim that it is useful in improving sexual functions and treating sexual disorders. AIM: We wanted to study the effect of yoga on male sexual functioning. METHODS: We studied 65 males (age range=?24-60 years, average age=40-8.26 years) who were enrolled in a yoga camp and administered a known questionnaire, i.e., Male Sexual Quotient (MSQ) before and after 12 weeks session of yoga. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MSQ scores before and after yoga sessions. RESULTS: It was found that after the completion of yoga sessions, the sexual functions scores were significantly improved (P<0.0001). The improvement occurred in scores of all the domains of sexual functions as studied by MSQ (desire, intercourse satisfaction, performance, confidence, partner synchronization, erection, ejaculatory control, orgasm). CONCLUSIONS: Yoga appears to be an effective method of improving all domains of sexual functions in men as studied by MSQ.3460-3466Oct 2010http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/206461862010-11-15 20:08:25The Journal of Sexual Medicine710J Sex MedDOI 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01930.xISSN of Alternative and evidenceOBJECTIVE: Despite the growing interest in the neurobiological and clinical correlates of many meditative practices, in particular mindfulness meditations, no review has specifically focused on current evidence on electroencephalographic, neuroimaging, biological, and clinical evidence about an important traditional practice, Zen meditation. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, the ISI Web of Knowledge, the Cochrane collaboration database, and references of selected articles. Randomized controlled and cross-sectional studies with controls published in English prior to May 2008 were included. RESULTS: Electroencephalographic studies on Zen meditation found increased alpha and theta activity, generally related to relaxation, in many brain regions, including the frontal cortex. Theta activity in particular seemed to be related to the degree of experience, being greater in expert practitioners and advanced masters. Moreover, Zen meditation practice could protect from cognitive decline usually associated with age and enhance antioxidant activity. From a clinical point of view, Zen meditation was found to reduce stress and blood pressure, and be efficacious for a variety of conditions, as suggested by positive findings in therapists and musicians. CONCLUSION: To date, actual evidence about Zen meditation is scarce and highlights the necessity of further investigations. Comparison with further active treatments, explanation of possible mechanisms of action, and the limitations of current evidence are discussed.585-592May 2009Zen meditation2011-02-23 00:11:26NCBI PubMedPMID: 19422285journalArticleAmerican Journal of Medical Genetics. Part C, Seminars in Medical Genetics151C1Am J Med Genet C genetic uncertainty: the role of religion and spiritualityThis article argues that to the extent that religious and spiritual beliefs can help people cope with genetic uncertainty, a limited spiritual assessment may be appropriate in genetic counseling. The article opens by establishing why genetic information is inherently uncertain and why this uncertainty can be medically, morally, and spiritually problematic. This is followed by a review of the range of factors that can contribute to risk assessments, including a few heuristics commonly used in responses to uncertainty. The next two sections summarize recent research on the diverse roles of religious and spiritual beliefs in genetic decisions and challenges to conducting spiritual assessments in genetic counseling. Based on these findings, religious and spiritual beliefs are posited as serving essentially as a heuristic that some people will utilize in responding to their genetic risks. In the interests of helping such clients make informed decisions, a limited spiritual assessment is recommended and described. Some of the challenges and risks associated with this limited assessment are discussed. Since some religious and spiritual beliefs can conflict with the values of medicine, some decisions will remain problematic.68-76Feb 15, 2009Making sense of A randomized community-based intervention trial comparing faith community nurse referrals to telephone-assisted physician appointments for health fair participants with elevated blood pressureOBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of faith community nurse referrals versus telephone-assisted physician appointments on blood pressure control among persons with elevated blood pressure at health fairs. METHODS: Randomized community-based intervention trial conducted from October 2006 to October 2007 of 100 adults who had an average blood pressure reading equal to or above a systolic of 140 mm Hg or a diastolic of 90 mm Hg obtained at a faith community nurse-led church health event. Participants were randomized to either referral to a faith community nurse or to a telephone-assisted physician appointment. The average enrollment systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 149 +/- 14 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 87 +/- 11 mm Hg, 57% were uninsured and 25% were undiagnosed at the time of enrollment. RESULTS: The follow-up rate was 85% at 4 months. Patients in the faith community nurse referral arm had a 7 +/- 15 mm Hg drop in SBP versus a 14 +/- 15 mm Hg drop in the telephone-assisted physician appointment arm (p = 0.04). Twenty-seven percent of the patients in the faith community nurse referral arm had medication intensification compared to 32% in the telephone-assisted physician appointment arm (p = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Church health fairs conducted in low-income, multiethnic communities can identify many people with elevated blood pressure. Facilitating physician appointments for people with elevated blood pressure identified at health fairs confers a greater decrease in SBP than referral to a faith community nurse at four months.701-709Jul 20102010-07-27 16:21:59NCBI PubMedPMID: 1525-1497journalArticle DobosGustav Integrative Medicine - Medicine of the future or 'Old Wine in New Skins'?In Integrative Medicine (IM) the basic concept is the combination of mainstream with Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) supposably leading to synergistic therapeutic effects. In an extended version the methods of Mind/Body Medicine (MBM) are also added. As this is a new concept, changing the approach towards illness, while adding more instruments to the therapeutic [`]toolbox', IM might represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in modern medicine. The concept of Integrative Medicine is discussed here in detail by reviewing its scope and implications for the practice of medicine.109-115October Situated clinical encounters in the negotiation of religious and spiritual plurality: a critical ethnographyBACKGROUND: Despite increasingly diverse, globalized societies, little attention has been paid to the influence of religious and spiritual diversity on clinical encounters within healthcare. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to analyze the negotiation of religious and spiritual plurality in clinical encounters, and the social, gendered, cultural, historical, economic and political contexts that shape that negotiation. DESIGN: Qualitative: critical ethnography. SETTINGS: The study was conducted in Western Canada between 2006 and 2009. Data collection occurred on palliative, hospice, medical and renal in-patient units at two tertiary level hospitals and seven community hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited through purposive sampling and snowball technique. Twenty healthcare professionals, seventeen spiritual care providers, sixteen patients and families and twelve administrators, representing diverse ethnicities and religious affiliations, took part in the study. METHODS: Data collection included 65 in-depth interviews and over 150h of participant observation. RESULTS: Clinical encounters between care providers and recipients were shaped by how individual identities in relation to religion and spirituality were constructed. Importantly, these identities did not occur in isolation from other lines of social classification such as gender, race, and class. Negotiating difference was a process of seeing spirituality as a point of connection, eliciting the meaning systems of patients and creating safe spaces for the expression of that meaning. CONCLUSIONS: The complexity of religious and spiritual identity construction and negotiation raises important questions about language and about professional competence and boundaries in clinical encounters where religion and spirituality are relevant concerns.815-825Jul 2010Situated clinical encounters in the negotiation of religious and spiritual plurality2010-07-27 16:18:49NCBI PubMedPMID: Effect and the Molecules of Hope.Taking its point of departure from the author's theory that humor has a placebo effect, this article explores evidence that placebos have a positive biochemical effect, argues on the basis of this evidence that the placebo serves religious ends, and draws implications of this argument for physicians with religious convictions and for pastors who understand themselves to be agents of hope. It specifically argues that physicians should not pray with their patients and pastors should inform their parishioners of the negative as well as the positive effects of religion. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]541-549October 2010journalArticleJournal of Alternative and Complementary A Randomized Control StudyAbstract Objectives: The objective was to study the effect of the add-on yogic prana energization technique (YPET) on healing of fresh fractures. Materials and methods: Thirty (30) patients (22 men and 8 women) between 18 and 55 years with simple extra-articular fractures of long and short bones were selected from the outpatient department of Ebnezar Orthopaedic Centre and Parimala Speciality Hospital, Bengaluru. They were randomized into yoga (n = 15) and control (n = 15) groups. Compound, complicated, pathologic fractures, old fractures, and those associated with dislocations were excluded. Both groups received the conventional plaster of paris immobilization of the fracture site as the primary treatment. The yoga group, in addition, practiced YPET twice a day (30 minutes/session) for 2 weeks using taped audio instructions after learning under supervision for 1 week. YPET is an advanced yoga relaxation practice that involves breath regulation, chanting, and visualization, which according to yogic science revitalizes the tissues by activating the subtle energies (prana) within the body. Both the groups were assessed on the 1st and 21st day by the Numerical Pain Rating Scale for pain (NRS), tenderness (0-4), swelling (0-4), fracture line density (1-4), and the bridging of cortices (1-4). Results: Two (2) groups were matched on all variables. The Wilcoxon test showed significant improvement in both groups on all variables. Pain reduction (NRS) was better (p = 0.001 Mann-Whitney test) in the YPET group (94.5%) than in the control group (58.6%); Tenderness reduced (p = 0.001) better in the YPET group (94.4 %) than in the control group (69.12%); Swelling reduced by 93% in the YPET group and by 69.4% in controls (between-groups p = 0.093, i.e., nonsignificant); increase in fracture line density was better (p = 0.001) in the YPET group (48%) than in the control group (18.25%). The number of cortices united was significantly better (p = 0.001) in the YPET group (81.4%) than in controls Conclusions: YesiladaErdem Contribution of traditional medicine in the healthcare system of the Middle EastUnani medicine or Islamic medicine is one of the main healing systems in the world, which was set up by the Islamic physicians in the Middle East about a thousand years ago based on the teachings of Hippocrates and Galen. This medical system had been practiced widespread in the world including Europe until the 16th century and contributed greatly to the development of modern medicine. Despite the remarkable advancements in orthodox medicine, the traditional medicine has always been practiced in the Middle East communities. Due to cultural beliefs and practices, the Middle East communities have a very rich tradition in the utilization of herbal remedies as well as diverse spiritual techniques for treating various disorders. Traditional practitioners have become the main component of disease management in the Middle East and they have used herbal remedies along with spiritual techniques for the treatment of ailments mainly based on the Unani medicine.95-98Feb Kumar Cognitive Process: of information process and its congruent reactionsThe author presents a Buddhist understanding of the cognitive process of incoming information, its circulation and its congruent reactions based on the Buddhist spiritual meditative tradition of South and Southeast Asia.

Moving Beyond Health to Flourishing: The Effects of Yoga Teacher TrainingResearch in the medical and psychological fields has primarily followed a \"disease-focused\" approach to health. Although there is growing research on the components and outcomes of well-being, very few studies have focused on traditional practices that can be used as interventions to encourage human flourishing. The current study was developed to address this research gap. We suggest one effective method of increasing psychological well-being, the practice of yoga, an age-old practice that has been said to produce physical and psychological health. In this observational study, we examined associations with participation in a 4-week yoga teacher training resident program. Measurement instruments were chosen to capture changes in psychosocial health and human flourishing. Measurements were taken before the start of the program, immediately after the program, and 3 months postprogram. As expected, in this healthy population, the human flourishing scales showed more change than the psychosocial health scales. For example, in this healthy sample, there were no significant changes in perceived social support, quality of life, or self-efficacy from baseline to the 3-month follow-up. However, optimism, a positive psychology research measure, improved from baseline to follow-up. The mindfulness subscales of observation, awareness, and nonreactivity all improved following the training, suggesting that one benefit of yoga practice is a more refined ability to attend to one's inner experience. This study adds to the growing literature focusing on interventions that move beyond relieving pathology to those that produce optimal functioning and human thriving.788-7952010Moving Beyond Health to Flourishing2010-06-15 15:22:10ISI Web of KnowledgeThe Scientific Spirituality & Aging214DOI 10.1080/15528030903191649ISSN 1552-8030 Listening as a Symbol of Religion: A Chaplain's ResponseChaplains offer a different perspective for this discussion as they are at once religious professionals, but often working in secular settings. As religious professionals they are seen as persons who represent a particular religion and yet must be available to persons of all faiths. In this context, chaplains do understand and define religion because in the course of their work they also understand that some people do not believe in religion. A chaplain's ministry is to both believer and nonbeliever. Chaplains may have greater difficulty incorporating spirituality into their work if they are from a religious tradition that does not generally include this concept in their work. Chaplains are practitioners who work directly with the dual role of religious professional working with the tools of religion and yet often operating in secular settings.310-3152009 OctoberListening as a Symbol of Religionhttp://www.informaworld.com.ezproxy.bu.edu/10.1080/155280309031916492009-11-03 01:32:12Informaworld<p>This article is a response to an article by Alice Glickman critiquing contemporary approaches to the study of religion and spirituality among the elderly.

The limited study in exploring the nurses' perception on applying spiritual care in Hong Kong has been noted. This descriptive phenomenological study investigated the experiences of spirituality and spiritual care in Hong Kong from the nurses' perspective. Ten nurses were purposively invited for an unstructured interview. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis, and three themes emerged: the meaning of spirituality, benefits of applying spiritual care, and difficulties in applying spiritual care. This study provided preliminary insights into the development of spiritual care in Hong practice: developing some guidelines from evidence-based practiceResearch indicates that many social work practitioners are interested in using spiritual interventions in clinical settings. Unfortunately, studies also indicate that practitioners have frequently received minimal training on the topic during their graduate education. Drawing from the evidence-based practice movement, this article develops some guidelines to assist practitioners in using spiritual interventions in an ethical, professional manner that fosters client well-being. These guidelines can be summarized under the following four rubrics: (1) client preference, (2) evaluation of relevant research, (3) clinical expertise, and (4) cultural competency. The article concludes by emphasizing that these overlapping guidelines should be considered concurrently, in a manner that privileges clients' needs and desires in the decision-making CarePrimary Health CareReligion and MedicineYoung AdultAttitudes of Arab and Jewish patients toward integration of complementary medicine in primary care clinics in Israel: a cross-cultural studyThe purpose of this cross-cultural study was to evaluate patient perspectives on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) integration within primary care clinics. It is one of the first multiethnic studies to explore patients' perspectives on the best model for integrating CAM into the conventional care setting. We developed a 13-item questionnaire that addresses issues of CAM use, expectations from the primary care physicians concerning CAM, and attitudes toward CAM integration within a patient's primary care clinic. We constructed the questionnaire with cross-cultural sensitivity concerning the core concepts of CAM and traditional medicine in both the Arab and Jewish communities in northern Israel. Data for statistical analysis were obtained from 3840 patients attending seven primary care clinics. Of the 3713 respondents who were willing to identify their religion, 2184 defined themselves as Muslims, Christians, or Druze and 1529 as Jews. Respondents in the two groups were equally distributed by sex but differed significantly by age, education, self-rated religiosity, and self-reported chronic diseases in their medical background. Respondents in the two groups reported comparable overall CAM use during the previous year, but the Arab respondents reported more use of herbs and traditional medicine. Respondents in both groups stated that their primary expectation from a family physician concerning CAM was to refer them appropriately and safely to a CAM practitioner. Respondents in both groups greatly supported a theoretical scenario of CAM integration into primary medical care. However, Arab respondents were more supportive of the option that non-physician CAM practitioners would provide CAM rather than physicians.177-182Jan 2009Attitudes of Arab and Jewish patients toward integration of complementary medicine in primary care clinics in Israelhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/189929832011-03-28 22:23:36NCBI PubMedPMID: 18992983Social Science & R.

Complementary alternative medicine practices used by religious professionalsReligious professionals completed an online survey of their use of health related practices currently known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). They indicated how often they engaged in these practices and how often they had used these practices when helping other people. The majority of religious professionals used at least one of the practices when alone and when helping other people. The most frequently used practices were meditation and deep breathing exercises used both when alone and when helping others. Female respondents were more likely to use these practices on their own and when helping others than were males, and older respondents were more likely to use multiple CAM practices than their younger counterparts. Other Faith/Humanists used the most CAM practices when alone and Jewish respondents used the fewest. In general, religious professionals used fewer practices when helping others than they used for themselves. Limitations of this study and suggestions for future studies for examining CAM practices among religious professionals are discussed.172-182Jul 20102010-07-27 16:22:17NCBI PubMedPMID: 20658430<p>This study looks into the employment of complementary and alternative medicine by religious professionals, both alone and when working with patients, and finds that the majority of religious professionals do use CAM practices, particularly meditation and deep breathing.

METHOD: A comprehensive literature search identified 25 surveys conducted between 1982 and 1995 that examined the practices and beliefs of conventional physicians with regard to 5 of the more prominent CAM therapies: acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, herbal medicine, and massage. Six studies were excluded owing to their methodological limitations. RESULTS: Across surveys, acupuncture had the highest rate of physician referral (43%) among the 5 CAM therapies, followed by chiropractic (40%) and massage (21%). Rates of CAM practice by conventional physicians varied from a low of 9% for homeopathy to a high of 19% for chiropractic and massage therapy. Approximately half of the surveyed physicians believed in the efficacy of acupuncture (51%), chiropractic (53%), and massage (48%), while fewer believed in the value of homeopathy (26%) and herbal approaches (13%). CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that large numbers of physicians are either referring to or practicing some of the more prominent and well-known forms of CAM and that many physicians believe that these therapies are useful or efficacious. These data vary considerably across surveys, most likely because of regional differences and sampling methods, suggesting the need for more rigorous surveys using national, representative samples. Finally, outcomes studies are needed so that physicians can make decisions about the use of CAM based on scientific evidence of efficacy rather than on regional economics and cultural norms.2303-2310Nov 23, 1998http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/98277812009-11-04 suggest that between 30% and 50% of the adult population in industrialized nations use some form of complementary and/or alternative medicine (CAM) to prevent or treat a variety of health-related problems.

We explored how clinicians and other health care workers understand and view spiritual care provided to dying patients and their family members. METHODS: Our study was based on qualitative research using key informant interviews and editing analysis with 12 clinicians and other health care workers nominated as spiritual caregivers by dying patients and their family members. RESULTS: Being present was a predominant theme, marked by physical proximity and intentionality, or the deliberate ideation and purposeful action of providing care that went beyond medical treatment. Opening eyes was the process by which caregivers became aware of their patient's life course and the individualized experience of their patient's current illness. Participants also described another course of action, which we termed cocreating, that was a mutual and fluid activity between patients, family members, and caregivers. Cocreating began with an affirmation of the patient's life experience and led to the generation of a wholistic care plan that focused on maintaining the patient's humanity and dignity. Time was both a facilitator and inhibitor of effective spiritual care. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and other health care workers consider spiritual care at the end of life as a series of highly fluid interpersonal processes in the context of mutually recognized human values and experiences, rather than a set of prescribed and proscribed spiritual care is a core element of palliative care, it remains unclear how this care is perceived and delivered at the end of life. We explored how clinicians and other health care workers understand and view spiritual care provided to dying patients and their family members. Methods: Our study was based on qualitative research using key informant interviews and editing analysis with 12 clinicians and other health care workers nominated as spiritual caregivers by dying patients and their family members. Results: Being present was a predominant theme, marked by physical proximity and intentionality, or the deliberate ideation and purposeful action of providing care that went beyond medical treatment. Opening eyes was the process by which caregivers became aware of their patient's life course and the individualized experience of their patient's current illness. Participants also described another course of action, which we termed cocreating, that was a mutual and fluid activity between patients, family members, and caregivers. Cocreating began with an affirmation of the patient's life experience and led to the generation of a wholistic care plan that focused on maintaining the patient's humanity and dignity. Time was both a facilitator and inhibitor of effective spiritual care. Conclusions: Clinicians and other health care workers consider spiritual care at the end of life as a series of highly fluid interpersonal processes in the context of mutually recognized human values and experiences, rather than a set of prescribed and proscribed roles.</p>journalArticle LuckhauptSara E YiMichael United StatesPhysician-Patient RelationsQuestionnairesSpecialties, MedicalspiritualityBeliefs of primary care residents regarding spirituality and religion in clinical encounters with patients: a study at a midwestern U.S. teaching institutionPURPOSE: To assess primary care residents' beliefs regarding the role of spirituality and religion in the clinical encounter with patients. METHOD: In 2003, at a major midwestern U.S. teaching institution, 247 primary care residents were administered a questionnaire adapted from that used in the Religion and Spirituality in the Medical Encounter Study to assess whether primary care house officers feel they should discuss religious and spiritual issues with patients, pray with patients, or both, and whether personal characteristics of residents, including their own spiritual well-being, religiosity, and tendency to use spiritual and religious coping mechanisms, are related to their sentiments regarding spirituality and religion in health care. Simple descriptive, univariate, and two types of multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS: Data were collected from 227 residents (92%) in internal medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine/pediatrics, and family medicine. One hundred four (46%) respondents felt that they should play a role in patients' spiritual or religious lives. In multivariable analysis, this sentiment was associated with greater frequency of participating in organized religious activity (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.99), a higher level of personal spirituality (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08), and older resident age (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21; C-statistic 0.76). In general, advocating spiritual and religious involvement was most often associated with high personal levels of spiritual and religious coping and with the family medicine training program. Residents were more likely to agree with incorporating spirituality and religion into patient encounters as the gravity of the patient's condition increased (p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of primary care residents felt that they should play a role in their patients' spiritual or religious lives. Residents' agreement with specific spiritual and religious activities depended on both the patient's condition and the resident's personal characteristics.560-570Jun 2005Beliefs of primary care residents regarding spirituality and religion in clinical encounters with patientshttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/159173612009-11-13 20:10:09NCBI PubMedPMID: 15917361Academic Medicine: Journal assess primary care residents' beliefs regarding the role of spirituality and religion in the clinical encounter with patients.

Objective: To explore the role of spirituality in cancer management by men with prostate cancer who have declined conventional treatment and are using CAM. METHODS: This qualitative analysis is part of a longitudinal study to assess decision making by men with prostate cancer who decline conventional treatment and use CAM. In-depth interviews were conducted at study entry (n = 29). Themes were presented to participants in focus groups to further explore and validate the interview results. For a subset of participants (n = 10), spirituality emerged as an important theme; therefore, we conducted a secondary analysis of the interview data of these men to explore the role of spirituality in cancer management and decision making. RESULTS: Spirituality appeared to influence all aspects of the cancer experience. Most participants intensified their use of spiritual practice after a diagnosis of prostate cancer. These practices included spiritual ceremonies, indigenous healing, prayer, meditation, and use of spiritual imagery. Themes related to the role of spirituality in cancer management include beliefs about Western medicine, the role of spiritual beliefs in treatment decision making, the use of spiritual imager y and metaphor in healing, and the impact of cancer on spirituality. The discussion of these themes draws on quotes and case examples, illustrating how spirituality influenced study participants' response to diagnosis, treatment decision making, and cancer care. Two case examples provide a more in-depth understanding of how some participants incorporated spiritual imagery and metaphor into treatment decision making and cancer care. Ways in which cancer influenced spirituality are also discussed. Having prostate cancer appeared to influence their spirituality by strengthening their links with a spiritual community, increasing feelings of gratitude toward life, and improving personal relationships. Relevance: These findings indicate that spiritual beliefs and practices may play an important role in the formation of treatment choices for some patients. Health care providers need to be aware of and address patient concerns about how conventional treatment may conflict with their spiritual beliefs and practices. Further research and medical education is needed on spirituality and prostate cancer.117-122Jun 2006Cancer as part of role of spirituality in patients' use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches to cancer management has hardly been explored.

Recent studies show that mind-body interventions may improve prognosis in coronary heart disease and can enhance immune functioning. It is hypothesized that mind-body interventions reduce sympathetic nervous system activation and increase parasympathetic nervous system activity, and thereby restore homeostasis. Researchers have also concluded that cognitive therapy is as effective, and possibly more effective than antidepressant medication in the treatment of major depression. This report provides an overview of some studies that have shown a beneficial role of the relaxation response and cognitive restructuring in the treatment of headaches, insomnia, and cardiovascular disorders. Studies to date suggest that mind-body interventions are effective and can also provide cost savings in patient treatment.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey in a large random sample of 516 German outpatient care physicians with qualifications in 13 medical fields representative of a basic population of 118,085 statutory health insurance physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Telephone interviews with 36 wide-ranging questions about CAM attitudes and preferred techniques were conducted in November and December 2005 as part of a national healthcare survey. RESULTS: In our sample, 51% were in favor of CAM use (26% were very much in favor, 25% were in favor). The methods most frequently prescribed (combining answers for \"very often\" and \"at times\") were physical and dieting (62%), massage (61%), relaxation techniques (55%), followed by more typical CAM interventions such as homeopathy (38%), acupuncture (37%), and traditional Chinese medicine (18%). Primary care physicians were significantly more inclined to use CAM than were specialists. No striking differences were observed with respect to gender or age. CONCLUSIONS: This survey demonstrates a broader acceptance and practice of CAM by physicians than hitherto believed. Methods traditionally known as \"natural medicine\" were more frequently used than more typical CAM procedures. Further research should focus on physicians' differing motivations and observed results.1255-1261Dec To generate valid data on attitudes about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as well as patterns of use in a large stochastic sample of general practitioner physicians and specialists.

We therefore decided to study a representative sample of children with cancer in the German population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study took the form of a retrospective survey amongst all parents whose children were first diagnosed with a disease covered by the German Childhood Cancer Registry in 2001. The primary objectives of the survey were to establish the prevalence of use of CAM and the factors related to its use. RESULTS: Of the 1595 questionnaires sent out, 1063 (67%) could be evaluated. 35% of the responders had used CAM. The most frequently used methods were homeopathy, dietary supplements and anthroposophic medicine including mistletoe therapy. Factors which increased the probability of using CAM were the previous use of CAM, higher social status and poor prognosis of the child's disease. The most frequently named reasons for use of CAM were physical stabilisation, strengthening the immune system and improving the chance of cure. Whilst the sources of information about CAM were in most cases not doctors, 71% of users had nevertheless spoken to a doctor about using CAM. The effects of the CAM perceived by the parents were for the most part positive. 89% of the users reported that they would recommend CAM to other parents. CONCLUSIONS: CAMs are administered alongside standard therapy to 35% of children with cancer in Germany, usually by the parents. Prospective studies on the effects and side-effects of the most frequently used methods are urgently needed, and paediatric oncologists should have sufficient knowledge of CAM to enable them to advise parents professionally and competently about these treatments, too.2233-2240Oct 2008Complementary and alternative treatment methods in children with Few studies have been conducted to date on the prevalence of use of complementary and alternative treatment methods (CAMs) in paediatric oncology, and those that have been conducted are often not representative.

BACKGROUND: With the growing interest in spirituality in healthcare, has come the inevitable task of trying to conceptualise spirituality, a daunting task given the amorphous nature of spirituality, the changing understandings of spirituality among individuals and the diverse globalised society within which this task is taking place. Spirituality's relationship to religion is a particularly challenging point of debate. DESIGN: Critical review. CONCLUSIONS: Three social and historical conditions - located in the context of Western thought - have contributed to current conceptualisations of spirituality and religion: the diminishment of the social authority of religion as a result of the Enlightenment focus on reason, the rise of a postmodern spirituality emphasising spiritual experience and current tensions over the ideological and political roles of religion in society. The trend to minimise the social influence of religion is a particular Western bias that seems to ignore the global megatrend of the resurgence of religion. Current conceptualisations are critiqued on the following grounds: that they tend to be ungrounded from a rich history of theological and philosophical thought, that a particular form of elitist spirituality is emerging and that the individualistic emphasis in recent conceptualisations of spirituality diminishes the potential for societal critique and transformation while opening the door for economic and political self interest.

In order to make this increased popularity intelligible this paper challenges stereotypical images of users' motives and the results of clinical studies of CAM by exploring bodily experiences of acupuncture, reflexology treatments, and mindfulness training. The study draws on 138 in-depth interviews with 46 clients, client diaries and observations of 92 clinical treatments in order to identify bodily experiences of health and care: experiences that are contested between forces of mastery, control and resistance. We discuss why clients continue to use CAM even when the treatments do not help or even after they have been relieved of their physiological or mental problems. The encounter between the client and CAM produces derivative benefits such as a fresh and sustained sense of bodily responsibility that induces new health practices.719-733Jul a scale to assess the meditation experience.This paper describes the initial development of a scale to assess the effects of meditation. The scale consists of two sections: Experiences During Meditation (EOM-DM) and Effects of Meditation in Everyday Life (EOM-EL). Scale evaluation on 236 participants involved factor analysis, reliability and validity analysis. The EOM-DM scale had five subscales: Cognitive effects, Emotional effects, Mystical experiences, Relaxation and Physical discomfort. The physical, emotional, expanded consciousness and cognitive item groups of the EOM-EL were analysed separately. Each scale had a single factor structure whereas analysis of the EOM-EL-cognitive scale identified four factors: Social relations, Cognitive ability, Non-judgemental acceptance and Behaviours and habits. Construct validity was explored by assessing correlations with existing measures: Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, FACIT Spiritual wellbeing subscale and POMS-Short Form.

MedISSN patients want physicians to inquire about their spiritual or religious beliefs if they become gravely ill?BACKGROUND: Recognizing that many Americans draw on religious or spiritual beliefs when confronted by serious illness, some medical educators have recommended that physicians routinely ask about spirituality or religion when conducting a medical history. The most appropriate wording for such an inquiry remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine patient acceptance of including the following question in the medical history of ambulatory outpatients: \"Do you have spiritual or religious beliefs that would influence your medical decisions if you become gravely ill?\" METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires were completed by 177 ambulatory adult patients visiting a pulmonary faculty office practice at a university teaching hospital in 1997 (83% response rate). RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of the study patients described themselves as religious and 90% believe that prayer may sometimes influence recovery from an illness. Forty-five percent reported that religious beliefs would influence their medical decisions if they become gravely ill. Ninety-four percent of individuals with such beliefs agreed or strongly agreed that physicians should ask them whether they have such beliefs if they become gravely ill. Forty-five percent of the respondents who denied having such beliefs also agreed that physicians should ask about them. Altogether, two thirds of the respondents indicated that they would welcome the study question in a medical history, whereas 16% reported that they would not. Only 15% of the study group recalled having been asked whether spiritual or religious beliefs would influence their medical decisions.

A critical review of the recent literatureOBJECTIVE: Many Americans use religious activity to cope with stressful life events. Our goal was to review systematically the recent medical literature to assess the role of religion in health outcomes. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE to identify studies published in the English language between January 1999 and June 2003 describing the effect of religion on health outcomes. The search strategy used the medical subject headings (MeSH) of religion; religion AND medicine; AND psychology; and religion AND health. STUDY SELECTION: Religious, but not spiritual, interventions were selected for inclusion. Thus, papers describing interventions such as yoga, meditation, acupuncture, and qigong were excluded. Manuscripts describing randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, and partnerships with faith-based organizations were included. DATA EXTRACTION: We found five randomized controlled trials, four clinical trials, and seven faith-based partnerships that describe the impact of religious intervention on health outcomes. Papers were analyzed by four reviewers using a modified Delphi technique to reach consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: Religious intervention such as intercessory prayer may improve success rates of in vitro fertilization, decrease length of hospital stay and duration of fever in septic patients, increase immune function, improve rheumatoid arthritis, and reduce anxiety. Frequent attendance at religious services likely improves health behaviors. Moreover, prayer may decrease adverse outcomes in patients with cardiac disease.

This problem raises serious questions for health care planners, politicians and ethicists alike. The major world religions can play an important role in this discussion. Therefore, interreligious dialogue on this topic between ethicists and health care professionals is of increasing relevance and urgency. This article gives an overview on the positions of Islam and Christianity on equity and the distribution of resources in health care. It has been written in close collaboration and constant dialogue between the two authors coming from the two religions. Although there is no specific concept for the modern term equity in either of the two religions, several areas of agreement have been identified: All human beings share the same values and status, which constitutes the basis for an equitable distribution of rights and benefits. Special provisions need to be made for the most needy and disadvantaged. The obligation to provide equitable health services extends beyond national and religious boundaries. Several areas require intensified research and further dialogue: the relationship between the individual and the community in terms of rights and responsibilities, how to operationalize the moral duty to decrease global inequalities in health, and the understanding and interpretation of human rights in regard to social services.181-1892002Equity and resource allocation in health carehttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/121689932009-11-02 18:49:04NCBI PubMedPMID: in health and health care are one of the greatest challenges facing the international community today. This problem raises serious questions for health care planners, politicians and ethicists alike. The major world religions can play an important role in this discussion. Therefore, interreligious dialogue on this topic between ethicists and health care professionals is of increasing relevance and urgency.

The authors present a risk-benefit framework that can be applied to determine the appropriateness of using CAM therapies in various clinical scenarios. The major relevant issues are the severity and acuteness of illness; the curability of the illness by conventional forms of treatment; the degree of invasiveness, associated toxicities, and side effects of the conventional treatment; the availability and quality of evidence of utility and safety of the desired CAM treatment; the level of understanding of risks and benefits of the CAM treatment combined with the patient's knowing and voluntary acceptance of those risks; and the patient's persistence of intention to use CAM therapies. Even in the absence of scientific evidence for CAM therapies, by considering these relevant issues, providers can formulate a plan that is clinically sound, ethically appropriate, and targeted to the unique circumstances of individual patients. Physicians are encouraged to remain engaged in problem-solving with their patients and to attempt to elucidate and clarify the patient's core values and beliefs when counseling about CAM therapies.660-664Oct 15, 2002http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/123790662009-09-08 use of complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies by patients, health care providers, and institutions has made it imperative that physicians consider their ethical obligations when recommending, tolerating, or proscribing these therapies.

Including a strong consideration of data related to religion, spirituality, and worldview may seem only to complicate an already arduous task. The clinician who includes these factors in treatment is faced with decisions of when to discuss these issues, how to discuss them and in what depth, and finally, when to refer to a religious/spiritual professional. Nonetheless, the importance of these factors in the lives of many children and families leaves no option but to address them as directly as possible. It is well worth the effort and, in many cases, will open new areas for clinical improvement in patients.71-84Jan 2004Formulation and treatmenthttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy.bu.edu/pubmed/147233012009-11-03 06:25:19NCBI PubMedPMID: peer-reviewed studies in the past 20 years have shown that the relaxation response and mind-body interventions are clinically effective in the treatment of many health problems that are caused or made worse by stress. Recent studies show that mind-body interventions may improve prognosis in coronary heart disease and can enhance immune functioning. It is hypothesized that mind-body interventions reduce sympathetic nervous system activation and increase parasympathetic nervous system activity, and thereby restore homeostasis. Researchers have also concluded that cognitive therapy is as effective, and possibly more effective than antidepressant medication in the treatment of major depression. This report provides an overview of some studies that have shown a beneficial role of the relaxation response and cognitive restructuring in the treatment of headaches, insomnia, and cardiovascular disorders. Studies to date suggest that mind-body interventions are effective and can also provide cost savings in patient treatment. It is also clear, however, that mind-body therapies are not panaceas, and should be used in conjunction with standard medical care.</p>journalArticle Handbook of reviews and discusses the extensive research on the relationships between religion and a variety of mental and physical health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, cancer, and immune system dysfunction.

Unlike other works in this field, which focus primarily on spiritual experience, this clearly written volume focuses on the cognitive aspects of belief\u2014and how personal worldview affects the behavior of both patient and clinician. Informative case vignettes and discussions illustrate how assessment, formulation, and treatment principles can be incorporated within different worldviews, including practical clinical information on major faith traditions and on atheist and agnostic worldviews. This well-organized text sheds much-needed light on an area too often obscure to many clinicians, fostering a balanced integration of religion and spirituality in mental health training and practice.

A study of patients and oncology staff members on issues of complementary medicine and spiritualityBACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly being used by patients with cancer. OBJECTIVES: Our aim is to compare the attitudes of cancer patients who use CAM to those of nonusers, on issues of CAM, biopsychosocial considerations, and spiritual needs. METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to patients and medical care providers in a tertiary teaching hospital with a comprehensive cancer center. RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of the study patients reported integrating CAM into their conventional care. Health care providers considered psychological and spiritual needs as major reasons for CAM use, while patients considered the familial-social aspect to be more important. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients do not correlate CAM use with spiritual concerns but expect their physicians to attend to spiritual themes. Health care providers involved in oncology cancer care should emphasize spiritual as well as CAM themes. The integration of these themes into a biopsychosocial-spiritual approach may enrich the dialogue between patients and health providers.147-152Feb 2006Is a biopsychosocial-spiritual approach relevant to cancer treatment?http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/161330712009-11-13 20:24:24NCBI PubMedPMID: 16133071Supportive Care in Cancer: Official Journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer142Support Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly being used by patients with cancer.

EisenbergDavid M. ForysKelly Medicine: State of the Science, Implications for PracticeBackground: Although emerging evidence during the past several decades suggests that psychosocial factors can directly influence both physiologic function and health outcomes, medicine had failed to move beyond the biomedical model, in part because of lack of exposure to the evidence base supporting the biopsychosocial model. The literature was reviewed to examine the efficacy of representative psychosocial-mind-body interventions, including relaxation, (cognitive) behavioral therapies, meditation, imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis for several common clinical conditions. Methods: An electronic search was undertaken of the MEDLINE, PsycLIT, and the Cochrane Library databases and a manual search of the reference sections of relevant articles for related clinical trials and reviews of the literature. Studies examining mind-body interventions for psychological disorders were excluded. Owing to space limitations, studies examining more body-based therapies, such as yoga and tai chi chuan, were also not included. Data were extracted from relevant systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials. Results: Drawing principally from systematic reviews and meta-analyses, there is considerable evidence of efficacy for several mind-body therapies in the treatment of coronary artery disease (eg, cardiac rehabilitation), headaches, insomnia, incontinence, chronic low back pain, disease and treatment-related symptoms of cancer, and improving postsurgical outcomes. We found moderate evidence of efficacy for mind-body therapies in the areas of hypertension and arthritis. Additional research is required to clarify the relative efficacy of different mind-body therapies, factors (such as specific patient characteristics) that might predict more or less successful outcomes, and mechanisms of action.

It reviews recent findings and offers a research framework. The review links the age-related biology of stress and regeneration to the variability of mind/brain function found under a range of conditions from trauma to enrichment. The framework maps this variation along a biphasic continuum from atrophic dysfunction to peak performance. It adopts the concept of allostatic load as a measure of the wear-and-tear caused by stress, and environmental enrichment as a measure of the use-dependent enhancement caused by positive reinforcement. It frames the dissociation, aversive affect and stereotyped reactions linked with stress as cognitive, affective and behavioral forms of allostatic drag; and the association, positive affect, and creative responses in enrichment as forms of allostatic lift. It views the human mind/brain as a heterarchy of higher intelligence systems that shift between a conservative, egocentric mode heightening self-preservation and memory and a generative, altruistic mode heightening self-correction and learning. Cultural practices like meditation and psychotherapy work by teaching the self-regulation of shifts from the conservative to the generative mode. This involves a systems shift from allostatic drag to allostatic lift, minimizing wear-and-tear and optimizing plasticity and learning. For cultural practices to speed research and application, a universal typology is needed. This framework includes a typology aligning current brain models of stress and learning with traditional Indo-Tibetan models of meditative stress-cessation and learning enrichment.186-198Aug 2009Optimizing learning surveys the new optimism about the aging mind/brain, focusing on the potential for self-regulation practices to advance research in stress-protection and optimal health.

Cultural practices like meditation and psychotherapy work by teaching the self-regulation of shifts from the conservative to the generative mode. This involves a systems shift from allostatic drag to allostatic lift, minimizing wear-and-tear and optimizing plasticity and learning. For cultural practices to speed research and application, a universal typology is needed. This framework includes a typology aligning current brain models of stress and learning with traditional Indo-Tibetan models of meditative stress-cessation and learning on spirituality and the patient-physician relationshipOBJECTIVE: To identify the preferences and concerns of seriously ill patients about discussing religious and spiritual beliefs with physicians. DESIGN: Three focus group discussions with patients who had experienced a recent life-threatening illness. Discussions were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and reviewed independently by two investigators to identify discrete comments for grouping into domains. A third investigator adjudicated differences in opinion. Comments were then independently reviewed for relevance and consistency by a health services researcher and a pastoral counselor. SETTING: Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Referred sample of 22 patients hospitalized with a recent life-threatening illness. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Almost all of the 562 comments could be grouped into one of five broad domains: 1) religiosity/spirituality, 2) prayer, 3) patient-physician relationship, 4) religious/spiritual conversations, and 5) recommendations to physicians. God, prayer, and spiritual beliefs were often mentioned as sources of comfort, support, and healing. All participants stressed the importance of physician empathy. Willingness to participate in spiritual discussions with doctors was closely tied to the patient-physician relationship. Although divided on the proper context, patients agreed that physicians must have strong interpersonal skills for discussions to be fruitful. Physician-initiated conversation without a strong patient-physician relationship was viewed as inappropriate and as implying a poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Religion and spirituality are a source of comfort for many patients. Although not necessarily expecting physicians to discuss spirituality, patients want physicians to ask about coping and support mechanisms. This exploratory study suggests that if patients then disclose the importance of spiritual beliefs in their lives, they would like physicians to respect these values.685-692Oct 2001http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/116790362009-11-13 02:08:26NCBI PubMedPMID: To identify the preferences and concerns of seriously ill patients about discussing religious and spiritual beliefs with physicians.

DESIGN: Multicenter survey verbally administered by trained research assistants. Survey items included questions on demographics, health status, health care utilization, functional status, spiritual well-being, and patient preference for religious/spiritual involvement in their own medical encounters and in hypothetical medical situations. SETTING: Primary care clinics of 6 academic medical centers in 3 states (NC, Fla, Vt). PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Patients 18 years of age and older who were systematically selected from the waiting rooms of their primary care physicians. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-six patients participated in the study. One third of patients wanted to be asked about their religious beliefs during a routine office visit. Two thirds felt that physicians should be aware of their religious or spiritual beliefs. Patient agreement with physician spiritual interaction increased strongly with the severity of the illness setting, with 19% patient agreement with physician prayer in a routine office visit, 29% agreement in a hospitalized setting, and 50% agreement in a near-death scenario (P <.001). Patient interest in religious or spiritual interaction decreased when the intensity of the interaction moved from a simple discussion of spiritual issues (33% agree) to physician silent prayer (28% agree) to physician prayer with a patient (19% agree; P <.001). Ten percent of patients were willing to give up time spent on medical issues in an office visit setting to discuss religious/spiritual issues with their physician. After controlling for age, gender, marital status, education, spirituality score, and health care utilization, African-American subjects were more likely to accept this time trade-off (odds ratio, 4.9; confidence interval, 2.1 to 11.7). CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware that a substantial minority of patients desire spiritual interaction in routine office visits. When asked about specific prayer behaviors across a range of clinical scenarios, patient desire for spiritual interaction increased with increasing severity of illness setting and decreased when referring to more-intense spiritual interactions.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess barriers to CAM communication in pediatric oncology. DESIGN/METHODS: A 33-question survey was sent via electronic mail to 358 pediatric oncologists in the United States. RESULTS: Ninety pediatric oncologists completed the survey. Ninety-nine percent of pediatric oncologists think it is important to know what CAM therapies their patients use. However, less than half of pediatric oncologists routinely ask their patients about CAM. This is primarily because of a lack of time and knowledge. Many physicians think some forms of CAM may improve quality of life, such as massage (74%) and yoga (57%). Over half of physicians thought that dietary supplements, herbal medicine, special diets, vitamins, and chiropractic might be harmful to patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric oncologists believe it is important to know which CAM therapies their patients use; however, they are not asking about them owing to lack of time and knowledge. To improve communication about CAM, increased physician education is needed. In addition, physicians should identify patients using potentially harmful CAM therapies. Furthermore, CAM research in pediatric oncology should focus on those modalities physicians believe may improve patient quality of oncology patients commonly use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), yet approximately only 50% of these patients discuss CAM with their oncologist.

This project explored this disparity by relating personal/professional characteristics of pediatricians to the frequency with which they give attention to spirituality and religion. METHODS: Pediatricians (N = 737) associated with 3 academic Midwestern pediatric hospitals responded to a survey that requested information concerning the frequency with which they (1) talked with patients/families about their spiritual and religious concerns and (2) participated with them in spiritual or religious practices (eg, prayer). The associations between these data and 10 personal and professional characteristics were examined. RESULTS: The results demonstrated the disparity, and the analysis identified 9 pediatrician characteristics that were significantly associated with more frequently talking with patients/families about their spiritual and religious concerns. The characteristics included increased age; a Christian religious heritage; self-description as religious; self-description as spiritual; the importance of one's own spirituality and religion in clinical practice; the belief that the spirituality and religion of patients/families are relevant in clinical practice; formal instruction concerning the role of spirituality and religion in health care; relative comfort asking about beliefs; and relative comfort asking about practices. All of these characteristics except pediatrician age were also significantly associated with the increased frequency of participation in spiritual and religious practices with patients/families. CONCLUSIONS: Attention to spiritual and religious concerns and practices are associated with a web of personal and professional pediatrician characteristics. Some characteristics pertain to the physician's personal investment in spirituality and religion in their own lives, and others include being uncomfortable with spiritual and religious concerns and practices.

However, little is known about spiritual care during serious illness, and whether it satisfies patients' and families' needs. The objective of this study was to describe spiritual care received by patients and families during serious illness, and test whether the provider and the type of care is associated with satisfaction with care. METHODS: Cross-sectional interview with 38 seriously ill patients and 65 family caregivers about spiritual care experiences. RESULTS: The 103 spiritual care recipients identified 237 spiritual care providers; 95 (41%) were family or friends, 38 (17%) were clergy, and 66 (29%) were health care providers. Two-thirds of spiritual care providers shared the recipient's faith tradition. Recipients identified 21 different types of spiritual care activities. The most common activity was help coping with illness (87%) and the least common intercessory prayer (4%). Half of recipients were very or somewhat satisfied with spiritual care, and half found it very helpful for facilitating inner peace and meaning making. Satisfaction with spiritual care did not differ by provider age, race, gender, role, or frequency of visits.

During the 1990s, however, American culture changed dramatically and religious healing became a commonplace feature of our society. Increasing numbers of mainstream churches and synagogues began to hold held \"healing services\" and \"healing circles.\" The use of complementary and alternative therapies-some connected with spiritual or religious traditions-became widespread, and the growing hospice movement drew attention to the spiritual aspects of medical care. At the same time, changes in immigration laws brought to the United States new cultural communities, each with their own approaches to healing. Cuban santeros, Haitian mambos and oungans, Cambodian Buddhist priests, Chinese herbalist-acupuncturists, and Hmong shamans are only a few of the newer types of American religious healers, often found practicing within blocks of prestigious biomedical institutions. This book offers a richly comprehensive collection of essays examining this new reality. It brings together, for the first time, scholars from a wide variety of disciplinary perspectives to explore the relatively uncharted field of religious healing as understood and practiced in diverse cultural communities in the United States. The book will be an invaluable resource for students of anthropology, religious studies, American studies, and ethnic studies, health care professionals, clergy, and anyone interested in the changing American cultural landscape.</p>journalArticleJournal of Clinical Nursing1814DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2009.02780.x PaleyJohn Religion and the secularisation of health careAims and objectives. To assess the claim that conceptualisations of religion and spirituality should be grounded in theology, and acknowledge the global resurgence of religion.Background. Although there is widespread agreement in the nursing literature that 'spirituality' is a broader concept than 'religion,' and should be understood generically, this approximate consensus has occasionally been challenged. A recent paper by Barbara Pesut and colleagues argues that the generic view not only empties spirituality of powerful religious symbols and narratives, but underestimates the continuing social influence of religion, and its resurgence on a global scale. Accordingly, these authors suggest three principles for conceptualising spirituality and religion in health care, one of which is that conceptualisations should be grounded in philosophical and theological thinking, and should not ignore the global resurgence of religion.Method. Critical review.Conclusion. The Pesut principle privileges theology, disregarding other disciplines which theorise religion. Arguably, it privileges specifically Christian theology, the history of which suggests a politics of orthodoxy and an epistemology of authority and obedience. The global resurgence of religion is not, in fact, global, as the industrialised countries have experienced a marked shift towards secular-rational values; and the postindustrial phase of development is associated with self-expression values, which represent a challenge not merely to religious institutions (arguably an affirmation of 'spirituality') but to traditional elites and structures of all kinds. Finally, religion 'resurgent' is not an attractive model for health care, since many of its most obvious manifestations are incompatible with the ideology of health professionals.Relevance to clinical practice.

DESIGN: The design involved a national mail survey. The subjects were internists, rheumatologists, naturopaths, and acupuncturists. MEASURES: Physician outcome measures were use of and attitudes toward six classes of CAM. Predictors were religious affiliation, intrinsic religiosity, spirituality, and religious traditionalism. RESULTS: There was a 65% response. Naturopaths and acupuncturists were three times as likely as internists and rheumatologists to report no religious affiliation (35% versus 12%, p < 0.001), but were more likely to describe themselves as very spiritual (51% versus 20%, p < 0.001) and to agree they try to carry religious beliefs into life's dealings (51% versus 44%, p < 0.01). Among physicians, increased spirituality and religiosity coincided with more personal use of CAM and willingness to integrate CAM into a treatment program.

In the US, most inpatients have religious needs, but physicians address them only occasionally and infrequently refer patients to clergy.

Furthermore, people may have greater spiritual needs during illness. We reviewed published studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and subject reviews that examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. We also reviewed articles that provided suggestions on how clinicians might assess and support the spiritual needs of patients. Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide. Several studies have shown that addressing the spiritual needs of the patient may enhance recovery from illness.

What does the evidence say?Most of the rhetoric decrying the incorporation of basic and positive spiritual care into clinical practice is not based on reliable evidence. We briefly review the current evidence, which demonstrates that (a) there is frequently a positive association between positive spirituality and mental and physical health and well being, (b) most patients desire to be offered basic spiritual care by their clinicians, (c) most patients censure our professions for ignoring their spiritual needs, (d) most clinicians believe that spiritual interventions would help their patients but have little training in providing basic spiritual assessment or care, (e) professional associations and educational institutions are beginning to provide learners and clinicians information on how to incorporate spirituality and practice, and (j) anecdotal evidence indicates that clinicians having received such training find it immediately helpful and do apply it to their practice. We point out the reasons that much more research is needed, especially outcome-based, clinical research on the effects of these spiritual interventions by clinicians. We conclude that the evidence to date demonstrates trained or experienced clinicians should encourage positive spirituality with their patients and that there is no evidence that such therapy is, in general, harmful. Further, unless or until there is evidence of harm from a clinician's provision of either basic spiritual care or a spiritually sensitive practice, interested clinicians and systems should learn to assess their patients' spiritual health and to provide indicated and desired spiritual intervention. Clinicians and health care systems should not, without compelling data to the contrary, deprive their patients of the spiritual support and comfort on which their hope, health, and well-being may hinge.69-732002Should clinicians incorporate positive spirituality into their practices?http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/120087962009-11-13 02:26:00NCBI PubMedPMID: 12008796Annals of Behavioral Medicine: A of the rhetoric decrying the incorporation of basic and positive spiritual care into clinical practice is not based on reliable evidence.

This could help inform national policies and raise awareness of the impact that a stay in an acute paediatric hospital can have on the spiritual needs of some of the children who use the NHS. METHOD: Pictures used in previous (US) studies were used to facilitate story telling, enabling children to talk about concepts that may not have emerged through direct conversation. A convenience sample of five hospitalised children were presented with the pictures one at a time and asked open-ended questions about each picture. Data analysis involved identifying emerging themes from the transcriptions using a grounded theory approach. FINDINGS: The main themes to emerge from the interview data were: the role of the child's relationships with family, friends and healthcare professionals; the impact of the hospital environment on the child; coping with invasive procedures; belief--children's views about their health and belief system. CONCLUSION: There is a need for all healthcare professionals to recognise that children have spiritual needs that can include religious beliefs, and that it is part of their duty of care to attempt to identify and meet the views of hospitalised school-aged children with complex healthcare needs related to spiritual care.

In considering this evidence, we believe a healthy skepticism is in order. One needs to remain open to the possibility that RS-related beliefs and behaviors may influence health, yet one needs empirical evidence based on well-controlled studies that support these claims and conclusions. We hope to introduce the dismissing critic to suggestive data that may create tempered doubt and to introduce the uncritical advocate to issues and concerns that will encourage greater modesty in the making of claims and drawing of conclusions. We comment on the following questions: Do specific RS factors influence health outcomes? What possible mechanisms might explain a relation, if one exists? Are there any implications for health professionals at this point in time ? Recommendations concern the need to improve research designs and measurement strategies and to clarify conceptualizations of RS factors. RS factors appear to be associated with physical and overall health, but the relation appears far more complex and modest than some contend. Which specific RS factors enhance or endanger health and well-being remains unclear.3-13February this article, we familiarize readers with some recent empirical evidence about possible associations between religious and/or spiritual (RS) factors and health outcomes.

On a personal level, this may involve achieving personal fulfillment or spiritual growth in the workplace. In the broader sense, spirituality is considered by many to be essential in an organization's interactions with employees, customers, and the community. This article describes a possible role for greater spirituality in healthcare organizations, whose cultures in recent decades have largely excluded spirituality or religiousness. This is the consequence of an analytical, scientific perspective on human health; a reductionist paradigm in biomedical research; and the inevitable bureaucratization occurring in large healthcare organizations. However, in recent decades, numerous scientific articles supporting a connection between faith or religiousness and positive health outcomes have been published. Because individuals seek meaning when experiencing severe illnesses, and humans universally respond to compassion and caring, spirituality among healthcare workers and managers appears highly appropriate. The article describes organizational barriers to the greater inclusion of spirituality in healthcare and presents several approaches to developing a more caring organization. These include eliciting extensive input from all staff and clinicians in identifying core or common values, ethics, and a philosophy of caring.

Making this paradigm shift in today's multicultural societies poses many challenges, however. This article presents 2 theoretical models that provide common ground for further exploration of the role of spirituality in medicine. METHODS: The 3 H model (head, heart, hands) and the BMSEST models (body, mind, spirit, environment, social, transcendent) evolved from the author's 12-year experience with curricula development regarding spirituality and medicine, 16-year experience as an attending family physician and educator, lived experience with both Hinduism and Christianity since childhood, and a lifetime study of the world's great spiritual traditions. The models were developed, tested with learners, and refined. RESULTS: The 3 H model offers a multidimensional definition of spirituality, applicable across cultures and belief systems, that provides opportunities for a common vocabulary for spirituality. Therapeutic options, from general spiritual care (compassion, presence, and the healing relationship), to specialized spiritual care (eg, by clinical chaplains), to spiritual self-care are discussed. The BMSEST model provides a conceptual framework for the role of spirituality in the larger health care context, useful for patient care, education, and research. Interactions among the 6 BMSEST components, with references to ongoing research, are proposed.

METHOD: A sample of 87 participants, enrolled in a National Institutes of Health-funded clinical trial examining the impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction on symptom management post-solid organ transplantation, completed the abbreviated instrument. FINDINGS: Exploratory factor analysis yielded three subscales: acceptance, inner haven, and trust. The Serenity Scale was positively associated with positive affect and mindful awareness and inversely related to negative affect, anxiety, depression, health distress and transplant-related stress. CONCLUSIONS: Serenity, a dimension of spirituality that is secular and distinct from religious orientation or religiosity, shows promise as a tool that could be used to measure outcomes of nursing interventions that improve health and well-being. IMPLICATIONS: Spirituality is recognized as being an essential component of holistic nursing practice. As nurses expand their use of spiritual interventions, it is important to document outcomes related to nursing care. The Serenity Scale appears to capture a dimension of spirituality, a state of acceptance, inner haven and trust that is distinct from other spirituality instruments.7-16Mar 2009The article describes a factor analysis of a 22-item version of the Serenity Scale, a tool that measures spirituality and well-being.

The survey canvassed GPs' opinions as to the harmfulness and effectiveness of CTs; current levels of training and interest in further training; personal use of, and use in practice of, CTs; referrals to CT; practitioners; appropriateness for GPs to practice and for government regulation; perceived patient demand and the need for undergraduate education. RESULTS: The response rate was 33.2%. Based on GPs' responses, complementary therapies could be classified into: nonmedicinal and nonmanipulative therapies, such as acupuncture, massage, meditation, yoga, and hypnosis, that were seen to be highly effective and safe; medicinal and manipulative therapies, including chiropractic, Chinese herbal medicine, osteopathy, herbal medicine, vitamin and mineral therapy, naturopathy, and homeopathy, which more GPs considered potentially harmful than potentially effective; and esoteric therapies, such as spiritual healing, aromatherapy, and reflexology, which were seen to be relatively safe yet also relatively ineffective. The risks of CTs were seen to mainly arise from incorrect, inadequate, or delayed diagnoses and interactions between complementary medications and pharmaceuticals, rather than the specific risks of the therapies themselves. CONCLUSIONS: Nonmedicinal therapies along with chiropractic are widely accepted in Australia and can be considered mainstream. GPs are open to training in complementary therapies, and better communication between patients and GPs about use of CTs is required to minimize the risk of adverse events. There is also a need to prioritize and provide funding for further research into the potential adverse events from these therapies and other therapies currently lacking an evidence base.995-1004Dec 2005The integration of complementary therapies in general practitioners' (GPs) attitudes toward and use of a range of complementary therapies (CTs) were determined through a self-administered postal survey sent to a random sample of 2000 Australian GPs.

The distinguished list of contributors examine a series of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) topics that relate to religious faith and behavior. PNI studies the relationships between mental states and the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. Among the issues it focuses upon are how mental states, in general, and belief states, in particular, affect physical health. The contributors argue that religious involvement and belief can affect certain neuroendocrine and immune mechanisms, and that these mechanisms, in turn, susceptibility to cancer and recovery following surgery.

Attending to spiritual needs can help managed care systems achieve their goalsIf managed care leaders are able to achieve their goals of enhancing total well-being within a capitated system of care, they must attend to the broad new societal interest in spiritual perspectives and find ways to integrate them into their structure of care. Imaginative and sensitive members of many professions, particularly those who acknowledge the value of spirituality in their own lives and are convinced of its value in healing, will likely spearhead this integrated movement. Promoting individuals' total well-being necessitates an acknowledgement that everyone has a unique personal spirituality that needs to be addressed at times of crisis, such as illness or hospitalization. Further, attention to the spiritual dimensions of problems that result in high healthcare costs, such as violence, alcoholism, and the fear of death, can help reduce those costs. The process of grief also needs to be addressed in healthcare settings, for professionals as well as patients, to enhance understanding, acceptance, and the quality of care. People recover and retain health through a balanced integration of physical, spiritual, and community aspects of their lives. If professional chaplains who have emphasized crisis and acute care in their ministry styles are to contribute to this integrative healing and its adoption into managed care systems, they may need to explore broader frameworks, holistic concepts of healing processes, motivations for self-care, and a personal holistic balance.43-461997 managed care leaders are able to achieve their goals of enhancing total well-being within a capitated system of care, they must attend to the broad new societal interest in spiritual perspectives and find ways to integrate them into their structure of care.

AndersonLucy body and the mind/emotions are now a well-established fact of medical research in the field of psychoneuroimmunology. The Scientific Basis of Integrative Medicine lays out the scientific underpinnings for the mind-body connection, documenting the numerous interactions of the endocrine, immune, nervous, and stress systems that so profoundly impact human functioning. The authors propose a unified theory of human functioning, called integral physiology, which combines important Western biological knowledge with Eastern medical traditions of healing. Unique aspects of the text include the elucidation of the pineal as the master gland-the transducer of environmental information into neuronal and hormonal communication within the body. In addition, the authors assert that there must be a hormonal cascade for the relaxation response, paralleling the well-known hormonal elaboration of the stress response, and then provide a review of some of the hormones involved in this response. The Scientific Basis of Integrative Medicine is the first book to elaborate on the cutting-edge field of subtle energy medicine. The authors propose a theory of the physiology of spirituality-or in medical terms, a theory of how subtle energy impacts physical and mental/emotional functioning. Subtle energy medicine recognizes energy modalities that can beneficially affect the body, while acknowledging the importance of experiences traditionally called \"intuitive\" or \"spiritual.\" It broadens awareness of how our bodies are both hard wired and hormonally designed to permit interactions with subtle energy. This medical textbook has been written in a unique, conversational style that incorporates both technical and scientific information, and anecdotal stories.</p>journalArticleAcademic Medicine: Journal of the Association of and religious identities, beliefs, and practices of academic pediatricians in the United StatesPURPOSE: Physicians' spiritual and religious identities, beliefs, and practices are beginning to be explored. The objective of this study was to gather descriptive information about personal religion and spirituality from a random sample of academic American pediatricians and to compare this information with similar data from the public. METHOD: In 2005, a Web-based survey of a random sample of 208 pediatrician faculty from 13 academic centers ranked by the US News & World Report as \"honor roll\" hospitals was conducted. Surveys elicited information about personal beliefs and practices as well as their influence on decisions about patient care and clinical practice. Multiple questions were replicated from the General Social Survey to enable comparisons with the public. Descriptive statistics were generated, and logistic regression analyses were conducted on relevant variables. RESULTS: Nearly 88% of respondents were raised in a religious tradition, but just 67.2% claimed current religious identification. More than half (52.6%) reported praying privately; additional spiritual practices reported included relaxation techniques (38.8%), meditation (29.3%), sacred readings (26.7%), and yoga (19%). The majority of academic pediatricians (58.6%) believed that personal spiritual or religious beliefs influenced their interactions with patients/colleagues. These odds increased 5.1-fold when academic pediatricians attended religious services monthly or more (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the American public, a notably smaller proportion of academic pediatricians reported a personal religious identity. The majority believed spiritual and religious beliefs influenced their practice of pediatrics. Whether secular or faith-based belief systems measurably modify academic pediatric spiritual and religious identities, beliefs, and practices are beginning to be explored.

Examples include prayer, meditation, mantra, affirmation, tai chi, and yoga. The purpose of these practices was to lead the practitioner to long term spiritual transformation toward an enhanced awareness of spirit, and a corresponding diminishment of identification with the mental and physical aspects of life. Unfortunately, the vagueness of the definition of transformation demonstrates that it is a broad and diffuse multidimensional concept difficult to quantify and resistant to rigorous research. However, these spiritual practices, offered as interventions separate from their spiritual tradition, have begun to be evaluated to document their effect on psychological and physical well-being. Currently, there are a number of well-designed studies that attest to the health-enhancing and suffering-reducing benefits derived from religiously transformative practices.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a qualitative study using semistructured interviews of 13 family physicians. POPULATION: We selected board-certified Missouri family physicians in a nonrandom fashion to represent a range of demographic factors (age, sex, religious background), practice types (academic/community practice; urban/rural), and opinions and practice regarding physicians' roles in addressing patients' spiritual issues. OUTCOMES MEASURED: We coded and evaluated transcribed interviews for themes. RESULTS: Physicians who reported regularly addressing spiritual issues do so because of the primacy of spirituality in their lives and because of the scientific evidence associating spirituality with health. Respondents noted that patients' spiritual questions arise from their unique responses to chronic illness, terminal illness, and life stressors. Physicians reported varying approaches to spiritual assessment; affirmed that spiritual discussions should be approached with sensitivity and integrity; and reported physician, patient, mutual physician-patient, and situational barriers. Facilitators of spiritual discussions included physicians' modeling a life that includes a spiritual focus.

Why Patients Use Alternative Medicine: Results of a National StudyContext.-- Research both in the United States and abroad suggests that significant numbers of people are involved with various forms of alternative medicine. However, the reasons for such use are, at present, poorly understood. Objective.-- To investigate possible predictors of alternative health care use. Methods.-- Three primary hypotheses were tested. People seek out these alternatives because (1) they are dissatisfied in some way with conventional treatment; (2) they see alternative treatments as offering more personal autonomy and control over health care decisions; and (3) the alternatives are seen as more compatible with the patients' values, worldview, or beliefs regarding the nature and meaning of health and illness. Additional predictor variables explored included demographics and health status. Design.-- A written survey examining use of alternative health care, health status, values, and attitudes toward conventional medicine. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used in an effort to identify predictors of alternative health care use. Setting and Participants.-- A total of 1035 individuals randomly selected from a panel who had agreed to participate in mail surveys and who live throughout the United States. Main Outcome Measure.-- Use of alternative medicine within the previous year. Results.-- The response rate was 69%.The following variables emerged as predictors of alternative health care use: more education (odds ratio [OR], 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1-1.3); poorer health status (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5); a holistic orientation to health (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9); having had a transformational experience that changed the person's worldview (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5); any of the following health problems: anxiety (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.6-6.0); back problems pain tract problems (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.5); and classification in a cultural group identifiable by their commitment to environmentalism, commitment to feminism, and interest in spirituality and personal growth psychology (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.7). Dissatisfaction with conventional medicine did not predict use of alternative medicine. Only 4.4% of those surveyed reported relying primarily on alternative therapies. Conclusion.-- Along with being more educated and reporting poorer health status, the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so not so much as a result of being dissatisfied with conventional medicine but largely because they find these health care alternatives to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life.1548-1553May 20, 1998Why Patients Research both in the United States and abroad suggests that significant numbers of people are involved with various forms of alternative medicine.

GaudiaGil About the evidence in \"evidence-based\" integrative medicine programsAlternative therapies are popular, and information about them should be included in the curricula of health profession schools. During 2000 to 2003, the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine awarded five-year education grants to 14 health professions schools in the United States and to the American Medical Students Association Foundation. The purpose of the grants was to integrate evidence-based information about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) into the curriculum. The authors reviewed the educational material concerning four popular CAM therapies-herbal remedies, chiropractic, acupuncture, and homeopathy-posted on the integrative medicine Web sites of the grant recipients and compared it with the best evidence available. The curricula on the integrative medicine sites were strongly biased in favor of CAM, many of the references were to poor-quality clinical trials, and they were five to six years out of date. These \"evidence-based CAM\" curricula, which are used all over the country, fail to meet the generally accepted standards of evidence-based medicine. By tolerating this situation, health professions schools are not meeting their educational and ethical obligations to learners, patients, or society. Because integrative medicine programs have failed to uphold educational standards, medical and nursing schools need to assume responsibility for their oversight.

A meta-analytic reviewBACKGROUND: The use of alternative treatments for illness is common in the United States. Practitioners of these interventions find them compatible with personal philosophies. Consequently, distant intercessory prayer (IP) for healing is one of the most commonly practiced alternative interventions and has recently become the topic of scientific scrutiny. PURPOSE: This study was designed to provide a current meta-analytic review of the effects of IP and to assess the impact of potential moderator variables. METHODS: A random effects model was adopted. Outcomes across dependent measures within each study were pooled to arrive at one omnibus effect size. These were combined to generate the overall effect size. A test of homogeneity and examination of several potential moderator variables was conducted. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis yielding an overall effect size of g = .100 that did not differ from zero. When one controversial study was removed, the effect size reduced to g = .012. No moderator variables significantly influenced results. CONCLUSIONS: There is no scientifically discernable effect for IP as assessed in controlled studies. Given that the IP literature lacks a theoretical or theological base and has failed to produce significant findings in controlled trials, we recommend that further resources not be allocated to this line of research.21-26Aug 2006Are there The use of alternative treatments for illness is common in the United States.

We examined the validity of these claims in two ways: (a) To determine the percentage of articles in the literature that were potentially relevant to such a claim, we identified all English-language articles with published abstracts identified by a Medline search using the search term religion in the year 2000, and (b) to examine the quality of the data in articles cited as providing supportfor such a claim, we examined all articles in the area of cardiovascular disease and hypertension cited by two comprehensive reviews of the literature. Of the 266 articles published in the year 2000 and identified by the Medline search, only 17% were relevant to claims of health benefits associated with religious involvement. About half of the articles cited in the comprehensive reviews were irrelevant to these claims.

Experiments on Distant Intercessory Prayer: God, Science, and the Lesson of MassahEXPERIMENTAL studies on the health effects of distant intercession (prayer) ignore important facets of construct validity, philosophy of science, and theology while focusing on issues like randomization and double-blinding. These tendencies reflect a desire on the part of researchers to remove nature as a causal factor when intercession seems efficacious. We argue that close attention to construct validity of cause-and-effect variables invalidates distant intercessory prayer as a scientific construct. Further, the application of statistical techniques to metaphysical causal phenomena is critiqued. We conclude that research on the effects of religion and spirituality on health should avoid attempting to validate God through scientific methods.2529-2536November 26, 2001Experiments on the health effects of distant intercession (prayer) ignore important facets of construct validity, philosophy of science, and theology while focusing on issues like randomization and double-blinding.

Heal Thyself: Spirituality, Medicine, and recent years, a movement stressing a causal relationship between spirituality and good health has captured the public imagination. Told that research demonstrates that people of strong faith are healthier, physicians and clergy alike urge us to become more religious. The religion and health movement, as it has become known, has attracted its fair share of skeptics. While most root their criticism in science or secularism, the authors of Heal Thyself, one a theological ethicist, the other a physician, instead challenge the basic precepts of the movement from the standpoint of Christian theology. Heal Thyself argues that popular culture's fascination with the health benefits of religion reflects not the renaissance of religious tradition but the powerful combination of consumer capitalism and self-interested individualism. A faith-for-health exchange misrepresents and devalues the true meaning of faith. For Christians, being religious does not mean enlisting faith as a vehicle to get what we want--be it health or wealth--but rather learning by faith to want the right things at the right time, and to live with a spirit of gratitude and hope.</p>bookImprint Academic ErnstEdzard Healing, Hype, or Harm?: A Critical Analysis of Complementary or Alternative Medicine2008-09-01ISBN writing this book are not 'against' complementary or alternative medicine (CAM), but they are very much 'for' evidence-based medicine and single standards.

These therapies claim to do what scientific, evidence-based medicine sometimes cannot -- provide cures for a wide variety of diseases and physical ailments. How can the average consumer find objective, scientific information evaluating these products and treatments? Without reliable data from scientifically qualified sources, consumers run the risk of wasting their money, or worse, endangering their health. This authoritative collection of research articles by reputable scientists is dedicated exclusively to the careful scrutiny of the claims of alternative medicine. Using scientific and rational criteria, well-respected scientists and physicians review available evidence for therapeutic claims, critique published studies, and discuss the methods and principles of valid research. Among the topics covered are the origins of alternative medicine and current trends; the theories and therapies of Andrew Weil, naturopathy, therapeutic touch, and colloidal silver treatment; the psychological dimensions of belief in unvconventional treatments; and the ethics of promoting unproven treatments.</p>journalArticle SloanRichard P. RamakrishnanRajasekhar. Science, Medicine, and Intercessory PrayerAmong the many recent attempts to demonstrate the medical benefits of religious activity, the methodologically strongest seem to be studies of the effects of distant intercessory prayer (IP). In these studies, patients are randomly assigned to receive standard care or standard care plus the prayers or \"healing intentions\" of distant intercessors. Most of the scientific community has dismissed such research, but cavalier rejection of studies of IP is unwise, because IP studies appear to conform to the standards of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and, as such, would have a significant advantage over observational investigations of associations between religious variables and health outcomes. As we demonstrate, however, studies of IP fail to meet the standards of RCTs in several critical respects. They fail to adequately measure and control exposure to prayer from others, which is likely to exceed IP and to vary widely from subject to subject, and whose magnitude is unknown. This supplemental prayer so greatly attenuates the differences between the treatment and control groups that sample sizes are too large to justify studies of IP. Further, IP studies generally do not specify the outcome variables, raising problems of multiple comparisons and Type 1 errors. Finally, these studies claim findings incompatible with current views of the physical universe and consciousness. Unless these problems are solved, studies of IP should not be conducted.504-5142006http://muse.jhu.edu.ezproxy.bu.edu/journals/perspectives_in_biology_and_medicine/v049/49.4sloan.html2009-10-09 18:59:00Project MUSEVolume 49, Number 4, the many recent attempts to demonstrate the medical benefits of religious activity, the methodologically strongest seem to be studies of the effects of distant intercessory prayer (IP).

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim is to offer a critical analysis of what the word 'spirituality' may mean when used in the Patients' Charter and to explore the implications of this for clinical practice. DESIGN: A critical discussion based on a literature review, examining in particular methodological presuppositions. METHODS: The meaning of 'spirituality' in the Judaeo-Christian biblical traditions is explored. Some of the heuristic assumptions in contemporary research on 'spirituality' are examined. Philosophical (i.e. non-scientific) and scientific questions to do with 'spirituality' are disentangled. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The paper concludes that: (i) 'Spirituality' is an elastic term not capable of universal definition as each person's spirituality is an individual matter for them and (ii) tools that are being developed for identifying a person's spirituality run the risk of making wrong presuppositions about what comprises spirituality. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is unlikely that tools can be developed that are widely applicable for identifying and assessing spirituality.11-16Jan paper explores the concept of 'spirituality' with reference to the Patients' Charter that stipulates that a person's religious, spiritual and cultural needs should be respected at all times.

Its treatments range from reputable methods like homeopathy and acupuncture to such bizarre therapies as nutraceuticals, ear candling, and ergogenics. Alternative approaches are endorsed by celebrities, embraced by the middle class, and have become a lifestyle choice for many based on their spurious claims of rediscovery of ancient wisdom and the supposedly benign quality of nature. As this hard-hitting survey reveals, despite their growing popularity and expanding market share, there is no hard evidence that any of these so-called natural treatments actually work. It reveals how alternative medicine jeopardizes the health of those it claims to treat, leaches resources from treatments of proven efficacy, and is largely unaccountable and unregulated. Bracing and funny, this is a calling to account of a social and intellectual fraud that has produced a global delusion.</p>bookBuffaloPrometheus Books RandiJames uncovers the faith-healing fakery found in the disturbing performances of evangelist Peter Popoff, W.V.

The notion that physicians have the time or training to make assessments and recommendations about spirituality is misguided. Whenever a physician demonstrates personal caring for a patient, the healing process is likely enhanced, and in that sense, physicians often promote the spirituality of the patient. However, recent proposals to extend the physician's task to that of assessing religion and directing the patient toward approved forms of spirituality are inappropriate.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the attitudes of faculty and staff toward CAM in medicine, nursing, and pharmacy within an academic health center. DESIGN: A survey was used to obtain data on general attitudes toward CAM, personal use, training needs, and perceived barriers to use. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The survey was taken of 627 faculty and students employed or enrolled at the University of Minnesota. The overall response rate exceeded 50% for both students and faculty. RESULTS: More than 90% of faculty and students believe that clinical care should integrate the best of conventional and CAM practices and that health professionals should be prepared to advise patients about commonly used CAM methods; 88% of faculty and 84% of students indicated that CAM should be included in their school's curriculum. While there were similarities between the 3 faculty groups, the nursing faculty expressed the greatest interest in practicing CAM. CONCLUSIONS: Faculty and students within medicine, nursing, and pharmacy have favorable attitudes toward the integration of CAM within education and clinical care. Personal use of CAM and training is limited. Lack of evidence is perceived to be the most significant barrier to integration of CAM into Western medicine. The high degree of receptivity suggests the need for both faculty training and curriculum development.44-47, 50-532002 Nov-DecAttitudes toward CAM among medical, nursing, and As interest in CAM continues to increase, schools of medicine, nursing, and other health professional training programs are being encouraged to integrate content on CAM into curricula.

DESCRIPTION: With the support of The University of Massachusetts Medical School Macy Initiative in health communication, funded by the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, we have fully implemented a medicine-spirituality curriculum as an integral aspect of our residency program. Current strategies include (1) new house officers participate in the workshop \"Communicating Bad News,\" which is based on a videotaped interaction and experiential role-play about the challenging \"art\" of sharing bad and often traumatic news; (2) a monthly lecture series that looks at various aspects of religious and spiritual practices and their implications on science and health with topics including the following: taking a spiritual history, exploring world religious views from a Judeo-Christian perspective, studying Eastern philosophies such as Buddhism and Hinduism, and discussing cultural diversity's effect on how people understand and cope with illness; (3) residents receive a comprehensive, evidence-based syllabus that encompasses all of the medical literature relating to spirituality, religion and health; (4) local hospice professionals give end-of-life care lectures about pain management, palliation, advanced directives, and ethical implications; (5) our residents spend one or two days per year with our pastoral care leaders and one to two days per year with our hospice team; (6) monthly ward rounds with a faculty member who emphasizes the spiritual dimension of a particular case and the faith-based resources in our hospital and community. DISCUSSION: Traditionally, graduate medical education has not emphasized the importance of spirituality as a \"target\" for routine inquiry, understanding, and sharing in the context of patient care. We are beginning to see that residents need to be aware of the relationship between spirituality and health, as a consequence of this curriculum. Because the curriculum is seamlessly integrated into a preexisting infrastructure (e.g., noon conferences, ambulatory off-site experiences, walk-rounds, etc.), it has been relatively easy to implement. Focusing on the literature has also provided a \"scientific door\" that has made this more palatable. Over time, we will foster a growing alliance of the medical and faith communities in our rural area. This has potent implications for community health initiatives. Two of our residents have already volunteered to give talks at local congregations. Spirituality and religion are sensitive and personal areas that can be awkward to embrace and openly discuss.

Unfortunately, student beliefs concerning spirituality and health have not been adequately assessed. This study examined medical student beliefs regarding the relationship between spirituality and health and the level of instruction spirituality should receive in the curriculum. Questionnaire results from 254 medical students indicated that religiousness and spirituality are important, with spirituality more important than religiousness. Spiritual practices were seen as more helpful for acute and mental health conditions than for chronic or terminal conditions and believed to be more helpful for coping with a health condition than healing tissue. Students believed that patients could benefit from spiritual practices more than they could for their own health conditions.

METHODS: A total of 192 students entering psychiatric clerkships were randomly assigned to one of two groups; both groups received identical didactic instruction on spirituality in medicine. One group worked on a problem-based learning case that featured spirituality as a prominent theme, whereas the other group worked on problem-based learning cases that made no mention of it. Students completed pre- and posttest questionnaires, and their examination at the end of rotation included a standardized patient encounter requiring them to elicit a spiritual history. RESULTS: Among the 131 students who completed and returned both questionnaires, a significant difference (p=0.001) was noted between groups on students' self-reported knowledge of taking a spiritual history. However, students in the two groups received identical scores on the component of the examination requiring them to write a spiritual history. CONCLUSIONS: Although students who were exposed to material on spirituality in medicine reported greater understanding of the issue, no difference in clinical performance was observed.67-732003Spirituality in medicinehttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/128241052009-11-13 04:26:54NCBI PubMedPMID: 12824105Academic Psychiatry: The Journal of the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training and the Association for Academic The authors sought to examine attitudes about spirituality in medicine among medical students in psychiatric clerkships and determine whether instruction on concepts of spirituality in medicine had an effect on students' clinical performance in related tasks.

Students completed pre- and posttest questionnaires, and their examination at the end of rotation included a standardized patient encounter requiring them to elicit a spiritual history. Results: Among the 131 students who completed and returned both questionnaires, a significant difference (p=0.001) was noted between groups on students' self-reported knowledge of taking a spiritual history. However, students in the two groups received identical scores on the component of the examination requiring them to write a spiritual history. Conclusions: Although students who were exposed to material on spirituality in medicine reported greater understanding of the issue, no difference in clinical performance was observed.</p>journalArticleAcademic Medicine: Journal of the Association of American GravesDarci L ShueCarolyn K role of spirituality in patient care: incorporating spirituality training into medical school curriculumOBJECTIVE: To answer the call for the implementation of spirituality into medical school curriculum,(1) UMKC-School of Medicine has incorporated experiential spirituality instruction into the third year of a six-year combined BA-MD degree program. The multifaceted objective of the program is to (1) expand students' conceptualization of the patient as person to include dimensions of spiritual beliefs and needs, (2) develop an understanding of how patients' spiritual belief systems impact their health, (3) recognize how the student's spiritual beliefs impact his or her practice of medicine, and (4) highlight the value of the chaplain as a member of the health care team. With increased understanding of the role spirituality plays in healing as well as the spiritual services available to patients, students will be able to serve the needs of their patients. DESCRIPTION: To accomplish this objective, students participate in lectures on spirituality, small-group activities focusing on skills such as taking/crafting spiritual histories, and an on-call experience with a hospital chaplain. During the oncall experience, students shadow a chaplain for approximately six hours. The experience includes discussing philosophies of spirituality and medicine with the chaplain, rounding with the chaplain, visiting and praying with patients when requested, comforting family members, and assisting with advance directive discussions and paperwork. After completing the experience, the students are required to write a reflective essay examining the following components: (1) the interaction between the chaplain and other members of the health care team, (2) the utilization of alternative interview and history taking methods, (3) the connection between spirituality and illness as illustrated through patient encounters, and (4) the insights gained from the experience that can be applied to the practice of medicine. DISCUSSION: The writing of one's spiritual history and the on-call experience were integrated into a new portion of the curriculum. The components were initially met with some reticence. In the beginning, students had difficulty distinguishing spirituality from religion and were concerned that the curriculum would take away from their study of \"real medicine.\" To ease concerns regarding the spiritual history, the course director modeled the objectives by sharing her own spiritual journey. Participation in the on-call experience substantially changed students' negative attitudes toward the curriculum. Essays revealed that the on-call experience had greatly impacted their view of the chaplain as well as their practice of medicine. Specifically, students demonstrated an understanding of the role of spirituality in healing, identified key components of the chaplain role in the hospital setting, shared ways in which they would utilize chaplains in the future, and discovered personal struggles. Crafting one's spiritual history, the on-call experience, and essays will continue to be a required part of the third-year curriculum. Modifications include adding the option of constructing one's own advance directive and striving for increased diversity of spiritual perspectives. The data provided in the essays and course evaluations will be utilized in several ways to determine the success of the curriculum and to answer critical research questions in the areas of spirituality and medical education.1167Nov 2002The role of spirituality To answer the call for the implementation of spirituality into medical school curriculum,(1) UMKC-School of Medicine has incorporated experiential spirituality instruction into the third year of a six-year combined BA-MD degree program.

Little is known about the patterns of and reasons for use of MBT by adults with common medical conditions. METHODS: We analyzed data on MBT use from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey Alternative Medicine Supplement (n=31,044). MBT included relaxation techniques (deep breathing exercises, guided imagery, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation), yoga, tai chi, and qigong. To identify medical conditions associated with use of MBT overall and of individual MBT, we used multivariable models adjusted for sociodemographic factors, insurance status, and health habits. Among users of MBT (n=5170), we assessed which medical conditions were most frequently treated with MBT, additional rationale for using MBT, and perceived helpfulness. RESULTS: We found a positive association between MBT use and several medical conditions including various pain syndromes and anxiety/depression. Among adults using MBT to treat specific medical conditions, MBT was most commonly used for anxiety/depression and musculoskeletal pain syndromes. More than 50% of respondents used MBT in conjunction with conventional medical care, and 20% used MBT for conditions they thought conventional medicine would not help. Overall, we found high rates (68-90%) of perceived helpfulness of MBT for specific medical conditions. DISCUSSION: MBT is commonly used by patients with prevalent medical conditions. Further research is needed to determine the reasons for widespread use of MBT for treatment of specific medical conditions and to evaluate the efficacy of are used by 16.6% of adults in the United States.

A research education program for students and faculty at the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine (OCOM), developed in collaboration with the Oregon Health & Science University School of Nursing, has been supported by an R25 award from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). A key initiative of OCOM's grant is the design of learning activities that infuse a research perspective into nonresearch courses in both the traditional Chinese medicine and biomedicine curricula. This approach was pilot-tested in course sequences chosen from each of the 3 years of the master's degree program. Learner-centered activities included Infusing Evidence and Reflection Into Introductory Qigong Classes (Year 1: Qigong), Using Evidence to Inform Acupuncture Point Selection (Year 2: Point Actions and Indications), and Media and Research in Western Clinical Medicine (Year 3: Western Clinical Diagnosis). Among the lessons learned are the need to infuse learning activities into the curriculum in a manner that minimizes interactivity redundancy and reinforces learning, the importance for faculty to communicate to students the rationale for introducing the learning activities, and the value of creating a learning activity design template to guide faculty recognition of essential elements in design and evaluation and to provide sustainable overviews of the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies become increasingly accepted healthcare options, it is of major importance for CAM institutions to enhance research literacy and an evidence-based perspective in their curricula.

Seeking common ground through dialogue, this ambitious work broaches questions about issues that face today's society, such as cancer, AIDS, death with dignity, in vitro fertilization, biomedical ethics, and more. The discussions cut through linguistic and cultural barriers to present a vision of the potential-and the inherent challenges-of being human. Avoiding scientific jargon, the book begins with a medical discussion of cancer and AIDS, as well as the problem of social discrimination against those infected. Questions about the fundamental nature of a harmonious existence are considered, as are specific issues such as the nature of brain death and ethical problems relating to fertility and childbirth. The origins of life, evolution, and the birth of humanity are also discussed.</p>journalArticle DeinSimon Attitude to HealthCultureHumansPatient ParticipationPsychiatryReligion and PsychologyspiritualitySpirituality, psychiatry and participation: a cultural analysisThis article begins by asking whether religion and spirituality are useful terms for cross-cultural comparisons. After discussing the increasing distinction between religion and spirituality in Western cultures, it points out how the terms religion and spirituality are used in divergent ways in the literature and the need for conceptual clarification in this area. Broadly, spirituality relates to interconnectedness, ultimate meaning or life force itself. The current use of the term spirituality in Western cultures derives both from Christian spirituality and 'New Age' thinking, which often appropriates ideas from Eastern religious traditions. The sociocultural roots of this division are complex, involving both growth of individualism, the pursuit of meaning and discontent with materialism and scientific rationalism. This situation is contrasted with other monotheistic religions where there is no distinction between religion and spirituality.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between spirituality healing and attitudes of self-reported perceptions about the medical encounter. DESIGN: A cross-sectional telephone survey. PARTICIPANTS: 3,728 Latinos aged >or=18 years residing in the United States from Wave 1 of the Pew Hispanic Center/Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Latino Health Survey. MEASUREMENTS: Dependent variables were ever prayed for healing (yes/no), ever asked others to pray for healing (yes/no), considered important spiritual healing (very vs. somewhat or not important), and ever consulted a 'curandero' (folk healer in Latin America) (yes/no). The primary independent variables were feelings about the last time seeing a Doctor (confused by information given, or frustrated by lack of information) and perception of quality of medical care (excellent, good, fair or poor) within the past 12 months. RESULTS: Six percent of individuals reported that they had ever consulted a curandero, 60% prayed for healing, 49% asked others to pray for healing, and 69% considered spiritual healing as very important. In multivariable analyses, feeling confused was associated with increased odds of consulting a curandero (OR = 1.58; 95% CI, 1.02-2.45), praying for healing (OR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.03-1.64), asking others to pray for healing (OR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.62), and considering spiritual healing as very important (OR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.01-1.66). Feeling frustrated by a lack of information was associated with asking others to pray for healing (OR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.60). A better perception of quality of medical care was associated with lower odds of consulting a curandero (OR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.98).

CalkinsDavid R. DelbancoThomas L. Unconventional Medicine in the United States -- Prevalence, Costs, and Patterns of UseBackground Many people use unconventional therapies for health problems, but the extent of this use and the costs are not known. We conducted a national survey to determine the prevalence, costs, and patterns of use of unconventional therapies, such as acupuncture and chiropractic. Methods We limited the therapies studied to 16 commonly used interventions neither taught widely in U.S. medical schools nor generally available in U.S. hospitals. We completed telephone interviews with 1539 adults (response rate, 67 percent) in a national sample of adults 18 years of age or older in 1990. We asked respondents to report any serious or bothersome medical conditions and details of their use of conventional medical services; we then inquired about their use of unconventional therapy. Results One in three respondents (34 percent) reported using at least one unconventional therapy in the past year, and a third of these saw providers for unconventional therapy. The latter group had made an average of 19 visits to such providers during the preceding year, with an average charge per visit of $27.60. The frequency of use of unconventional therapy varied somewhat among sociodemographic groups, with the highest use reported by nonblack persons from 25 to 49 years of age who had relatively more education and higher incomes. The majority used unconventional therapy for chronic, as opposed to life-threatening, medical conditions. Among those who used unconventional therapy for serious medical conditions, the vast majority (83 percent) also sought treatment for the same condition from a medical doctor; however, 72 percent of the respondents who used unconventional therapy did not inform their medical doctor that they had done so. Extrapolation to the U.S. population suggests that in 1990 Americans made an estimated 425 million visits to providers of unconventional therapy. This number exceeds the number of visits to all U.S. primary care physicians (388 million). Expenditures associated with use of unconventional therapy in 1990 amounted to approximately $13.7 billion, three quarters of which ($10.3 billion) was paid out of pocket. This figure is comparable to the $12.8 billion spent out of pocket annually for all hospitalizations in the United States.

In the present article, Ayurvedic herbal formulations and single plant drugs used traditionally in treatment of gynecological disorders are described.</p>journalArticle SvobodaR E HumansMedicine, AyurvedicPreventive MedicineAyurveda's role in preventing diseaseModern medical science is currently in the throes of a revolution which is likely to have a dramatic impact on both the theory of medicine and the way it is practised.

Part 1--Ayurveda, the science of lifeAyurveda is a natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000 years ago. Its main objective is to achieve optimal health and well-being through a comprehensive approach that addresses mind, body, behavior, and environment. Ayurveda emphasizes prevention and health promotion, and provides treatment for disease. It considers the development of consciousness to be essential for optimal health and meditation as the main technique for achieving this. Treatment of disease is highly individualized and depends on the psychophysiologic constitution of the patient. There are different dietary and lifestyle recommendations for each season of the year. Common spices are utilized in treatment, as well as herbs and herbal mixtures, and special preparations known as Rasayanas are used for rejuvenation, promotion of longevity, and slowing of the aging process. A group of purification procedures known as Panchakarma removes toxins from the physiology. Whereas Western allopathic medicine is excellent in handling acute medical crises, Ayurveda demonstrates an ability to manage chronic disorders that Western medicine has been unable to. It may be projected from Ayurveda's comprehensive approach, emphasis on prevention, and ability to manage chronic disorders that its widespread use would improve the health status of the world's population.1011-1019Nov 2007Utilization of is a natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000 years ago.

Some discussions differentiate between \"healing\" and \"curing.\" Many of these meanings surface when examining what efficacy means in the practice of acupuncture in the United States. This complex phenomenon is possible largely because acupuncture draws on the qi paradigm on the one hand, allowing for the most ephemeral dimensions of experience to be included in considerations of efficacy. On the other hand, in the most material sense, acupuncture is also susceptible to being conceptualized as a device, independent of that same paradigm, allowing for the insertion of biomedical models and criteria.

My first visit to a laboratory at National Taiwan University opened my eyes to the possibilities of herbal medicine research, especially in the area of veterinary medicine. It became my ambition to link the knowledge of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda from the Indian subcontinent and their integration with other systems of medicine, including Western medicine (WM), to achieve the concept of Sustainable Medicine, firstly for animals and then for humans. The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has implemented a technology development program to quickly establish the key technologies, and this is a moment of opportunity for Taiwan's traditional herbal medicine industry to upgrade and transform itself.

It became my ambition to link the knowledge of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda from the Indian subcontinent and their integration with other systems of medicine, including Western medicine (WM), to achieve the concept of Sustainable Medicine, firstly for animals and then for humans. The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has implemented a technology development program to quickly establish the key technologies, and this is a moment of opportunity for Taiwan's traditional herbal medicine industry to upgrade and transform itself. This paper, initially intended to be a student's narration, has evolved into a multi-author treatise on the present state and likely future scenario of herbal medicine research in Taiwan.</p>journalArticle AuS HiewS Complementary ProjectsProgram Western medicine and Traditional Chinese medicine in GP surgeries and the community: a review of the two pilot schemesThe popularity of complementary medicine has been relentless over the past decade.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to characterize use of t'ai chi and qigong for health with regard to sociodemographics, health status, medical conditions, perceptions of helpfulness, and disclosure of use to medical professionals. METHODS: We analyzed associations of t'ai chi and qigong use for health using cross-sectional data from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Alternative Medicine Supplement (n = 31,044). The 2002 NHIS estimated the number of t'ai chi and qigong users for health to be 2.5 and 0.5 million persons, respectively. We collapsed t'ai chi and qigong use into a single category (TCQ) for analysis, representing 2.8 million individuals. RESULTS: We found that neither age nor sex was associated with TCQ use. TCQ users were more likely than nonusers to be Asian than white (odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-3.15), college educated (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.97-3.03), and less likely to live in the Midwest (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.96) or the southern United States (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36-0.72) than the West. TCQ use was associated independently with higher reports of musculoskeletal conditions (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.11-1.83), severe sprains (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.14-2.40), and asthma (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.08-2.10). Half of TCQ users also used yoga for health in the last 12 months. Most TCQ users reported their practice to be important to maintain health, but only a quarter of users disclosed their practice to a medical professional. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, TCQ is practiced for health by a diverse population, and users report benefits for maintaining health. Further research is needed to establish efficacy and safety for target populations, including those with musculoskeletal and pulmonary disease, as well as for preventive health.969-973Sep 2009T'ai chi and Little is known in the United States about those who practice t'ai chi and qigong, two mind-body techniques that originated in Asia.

Reacting to what is perceived as biomedicine's focus on the physiological, those who describe themselves as favoring a holistic orientation often use the language of \"energy blockage\" to explain illness, whether thought of as \"physical,\" \"emotional,\" or \"spiritual.\" Acupuncture in particular has been appropriated as one modality with which to \"unblock\" such conditions, leading to its being used by some practitioners in conjunction with more psychotherapeutic approaches which include valuing the verbalizing of feelings. Some non-Chinese practitioners in the United States, returning to older Chinese texts to develop \"an American acupuncture,\" are reinserting diagnoses eliminated from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) by the People's Republic of China as \"superstition.\" The assumption has been that many such diagnostic categories refer to psychological or spiritual conditions, and therefore may be useful in those American contexts which favor this orientation. Among these categories are those drawn from traditions of demonology in Chinese medicine. What was once a religious category in China turns psychological in the American setting. At the same time, many who use these terms have, since the late 1960s, increasingly conflated the psychological and the religious, the latter being reframed as \"spiritual.\" Thus, this indigenization of Chinese practices is a complex synthesis which can be described as simultaneously medical, psychotherapeutic, and religious.413-443Dec paper explores ways in which Chinese healing practices have undergone acculturation in the United States since the early 1970s.

This database was started in 1994 and holds approximately 1300 references going back to 1986, covering medical applications, scientific, and experimental studies on qigong from China, the United States, and Europe. Records in English have been compiled from International Qigong conferences and seminars, scientific journals, magazines, dissertations, MEDLINE, and other databases. The therapeutic role of qigong exercises combined with drugs is reported for three medical conditions that require drug therapy for health maintenance: hypertension, respiratory disease, and cancer. In these studies, drugs were administered to all patients who were divided into two groups, a group that practiced qigong exercises and a control group that did not. Taken together, these studies suggest that practicing qigong exercises may favorably affect many functions of the body, permit reduction of the dosage of drugs required for health maintenance, and provide greater health benefits than the use of drug therapy alone. For hypertensive patients, combining qigong practice with drug therapy for hypertensive patients resulted in reduced incidence of stroke and mortality and reduced dosage of drugs required for blood pressure maintenance. For asthma patients, the combination therapy permitted reduction in drug dosage, the need for sick leave, duration of hospitalization, and costs of therapy. For cancer patients, the combination therapy reduced the side effects of cancer therapy. Also reported is a study showing that the practice of qigong helps to rehabilitate drug addicts.

Currently, it may seem natural that cosmetic surgery should be perceived as permissible, and in our modern liberal age, it seems strange to attempt justifying certain surgical acts in the light of a particular cultural or religious tradition. Yet every day, cruel realities demonstrate that although the foremost intention of any scripture or tradition has been mainly to promote religious and moral values, most religions, including Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, invariably affect human behavior and attitude deeply, dictating some rigid positions regarding critical health issues. METHODS: A Web search was conducted, and the literature was reviewed using the Medline search tool. RESULTS: Islamic law closely regulates and governs the life of every Muslim. Bioethical deliberation is inseparable from the religion itself, which emphasizes continuities between body and mind, between material and spiritual realms, and between ethics and jurisprudence. CONCLUSIONS: The rule in Islam is that individuals should be satisfied with the way Allah has created them. Islam welcomes, however, the practice of plastic surgery as long as it is done for the benefit of patients. Even if it clearly considers \"changing the creation of Allah\" as unlawful, Islamic law is ambiguous regarding cosmetic surgery. Its objection to cosmetic surgery is not absolute. It is rather an objection to exaggeration and extremism.

Only since about 1990 has the presence of HIV/AIDS in Islamic countries cast light on the fact that the actual sexual behaviour of the population does not always conform to religious norms. The increase in the numbers of people with HIV has compelled religious leaders to take a stand on sexual practices they consider \"deviant\", from prostitution to homosexuality and extramarital sex. The aim of this paper is to analyse the attitude of Muslim religious authorities towards individual sexual behaviour and AIDS. It is based mainly on contemporary legal responses that largely provide the necessary information on most of Islamic medical ethics. According to Muslim scholars, AIDS is a warning from God not to indulge in illicit conduct. As a remedy against the spread of AIDS, they encourage compliance with traditional family values and the enhancement of faith and devotion and strongly oppose sex education. They oppose promotion of condoms or any form of safe sex outside of marriage, which they perceive as promoting promiscuity and defiance of divine law. All the above-mentioned arguments are not exhaustive of the Islamic attitude towards AIDS. Some religious groups disagree with such a conservative way of conceiving the fight against AIDS as being antithetical to both men's and women's well-being.

In Islam, bioethical decision-making is carried out within a framework of values derived from revelation and tradition. It is intimately linked to the broad ethical teachings of the Qur'an and the tradition of the Prophet Muhammed, and thus to the interpretation of Islamic law. In this way, Islam has the flexibility to respond to new biomedical technologies. Islamic bioethics emphasizes prevention and teaches that the patient must be treated with respect and compassion and that the physical, mental and spiritual dimensions of the illness experience be taken into account.

Western psychotherapy ineffectively treats Muslim women because its individualistic and fragmented method is contrary to the Muslim population's holistic spiritual approach to life.

An Islamic perspectiveWe are at a time of unprecedented increase in knowledge of rapidly changing technology. Such biotechnology especially when it involves human subjects raises complex ethical, legal, social and religious issues. A World Health Organization expert consultation concluded that \"genetics advances will only be acceptable if their application is carried out ethically, with due regard to autonomy, justice, education and the beliefs and resources of each nation and community.\" Public health authorities are increasingly concerned by the high rate of births with genetic disorders especially in developing countries where Muslims are a majority. Therefore, it is imperative to scrutinize the available methods of prevention and management of genetic disorders. A minimum level of cultural awareness is a necessary prerequisite for the delivery of care that is culturally sensitive, especially in Islamic countries. Islam presents a complete moral, ethical, and medical framework, it is a religion which encompasses the secular with the spiritual, the mundane with the celestial and hence forms the basis of the ethical, moral and even juridical attitudes and laws towards any problem or situation.

It compares the positions of \"classic\" Muslim law and contemporary religious authorities; laws in Muslim countries; the attitudes and concrete behaviour of populations, families and individuals, as well as the regulations of medical associations, bioethics committees etc.. The result is a mosaic of positions which are often different (including from the point of view of ethics) but all in pursuit of legitimisation according to the Koran and the Shari'a. The work has an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on law, sociology, anthropology, politics and the history of science. For this reason it will be of interest to scholars and operators in a wide variety of disciplines and fields.</p>journalArticle Rispler-ChaimV Bioethical IssuesEgyptEthics, MedicalHumansISLAMReligion and MedicineSocial medical ethics in the 20th centuryWhile the practice of Western medicine is known today to doctors of all ethnic and religious groups, its standards are subject to the availability of resources.

Edited by Jonathan E. Brockopp and Thomas Eich, the volume challenges traditional presumptions of theory and practice to demonstrate the ways in which Muslims balance respect for their heritage with the health issues of a modern world. Like members of many other faiths, Muslims are deeply engaged by the technological challenges posed by modern biomedicine, and they respond to those challenges with enormous creativity--whether as patients, doctors, or religious scholars. Muslim Medical Ethics demonstrates that religiously based cultural norms often inform medical practice, and vice versa, in an ongoing discourse. The contributors map the breadth and boundaries of this discourse through discussions of contested issues on the cutting edge of ethical debates, from fertilized embryos in Saudi Arabia to patient autonomy in Toronto, from organ trafficking in Egypt to sterilization in Tanzania. As the authors illustrate, the effects of Muslim medical ethics have ramifications beyond the Muslim world. With growing populations of Muslims in North America and Europe, Western physicians and health-care workers should be educated on the special needs of this category of patients. In every essay the richness of the Islamic tradition is visible. In the premodern period Muslim physicians were considered among the best in the world, building and improving on Greek and Indian traditions. Muslim physicians today continue that tradition while incorporating scientific advances. Scholars of Islamic law work closely with physicians to develop ethical guidelines for national and international bodies, and individual Muslims take full advantage of advances in medicine and religious law, combining them with the wisdom of Sufism and traditions of family and community. This exploration of Muslim medical ethics is therefore a foray into the richness and sophistication of the Islamic tradition itself. Designed as an engaging point of entrance for students in religious studies, anthropology, ethics, and medical humanities, this pathbreaking volume also has utility for health-care To explore psychiatry in Islam, with a view to informing Western psychiatrists working with Islamic patients, and Islamic medical students studying in Western countries. METHODS: The first necessary step was to acquire some understanding of Islam, Sharia and Sharia law, as the basis on which the available psychiatric literature was considered. Standard textbooks on Islam and English-language papers in the psychiatric literature were examined. Discussions with knowledgeable Muslim people were conducted. RESULTS: Islam shares roots with the other Abrahamic, monotheistic religions: Judaism and Christianity. A central issues is unity: the unity of God, unity with God and unity within the Islamic community. Islam is more than a religion, because it informs all aspects of behaviour and has been described as 'a comprehensive way of life'. Individualism is less important than the welfare of the community. The Sharia is a list of rules and regulations derived from authentic sources. Psychiatric services in Islam, according to Western standards, are somewhat limited. This issue is being addressed through epidemiological studies, provision of new services and policy development. Although mental health legislation is not universal, forensic psychiatry has a role, in many ways similar to that in the West. CONCLUSION: Islam is based on unity and core values of compassion, justice and benevolence. Islamic psychiatry has a proud early history, and advances are occurring.

OBJECTIVE: To elicit the perceived influence of Islam upon the practice patterns of immigrant Muslim physicians in the USA. DESIGN: Ten face-to-face, in-depth, semistructured interviews with Muslim physicians from various backgrounds and specialties trained outside the USA and practising within the the country. Data were analysed according to the conventions of qualitative research using a modified grounded-theory approach. RESULTS: There were a variety of views on the role of Islam in medical practice. Several themes emerged from our interviews: (1) a trend to view Islam as enhancing virtuous professional behaviour; (2) the perception of Islam as influencing the scope of medical practice through setting boundaries on career choices, defining acceptable medical procedures and shaping social interactions with physician peers; (3) a perceived need for Islamic religious experts within Islamic medical ethical deliberation. Limitations: This is a pilot study intended to yield themes and hypotheses for further investigation and is not meant to fully characterise Muslim physicians at large. CONCLUSIONS: Immigrant Muslim physicians practising within the USA perceive Islam to play a variable role within their clinical practice, from influencing interpersonal relations and character development to affecting specialty choice and procedures performed. Areas of ethical challenges identified include catering to populations with lifestyles at odds with Islamic teachings, end-of-life care and maintaining a faith identity within the culture of medicine. Further study of the interplay between Islam and Muslim medical practice and the manner and degree to which Islamic values and law inform ethical decision-making is needed.365-369May 2008The perceived role of Islam in immigrant Muslim medical practice within the Islam and Muslims are underrepresented in the medical literature and the influence of physician's cultural beliefs and religious values upon the clinical encounter has been understudied.

Protestant bioethics\"Protestant\" is a term applied to many different Christian denominations, with a wide range of beliefs, who trace their common origin to the Reformation of the 16th century. Protestant ideas have profoundly influenced modern bioethics, and most Protestants would see mainstream bioethics as compatible with their personal beliefs. This makes it difficult to define a uniquely Protestant approach to bioethics. In this article we provide an overview of common Protestant beliefs and highlight concepts that have emerged from Protestant denominations that are particularly relevant to bioethics. These include the sovereignty of God, the value of autonomy and the idea of medicine as a calling as well as a profession. Most Canadian physicians will find that they share certain values and beliefs with the majority of their Protestant patients. Physicians should be particularly sensitive to their Protestant patients' beliefs when dealing with end-of-life issues, concerns about consent and refusal of care, and beginning-of-life issues such as abortion, genetic testing and the use of assisted reproductive technologies. Physicians should also recognize that members of certain Protestant groups and denominations may have unique wishes concerning treatment. Understanding how to elicit these wishes and respond appropriately will allow physicians to enhance patient care and minimize conflict.339-343Feb 5, is a term applied to many different Christian denominations, with a wide range of beliefs, who trace their common origin to the Reformation of the 16th century.

We fully entrust the care of our bodies to the medical profession, often taking its solutions and judgments as gospel. But what role, if any, should our Christian faith play in all this? In Reclaiming the Body, a physician and a theologian take a critical look at some of the assumptions we draw from the medical profession and explore what theology has to say about medicine, our bodies, our health, and the Body of Christ. The authors deal with such issues as suffering, caring for the sick, children and reproductive technologies, medicine and the poor, our obsession with physical perfection, and death and dying.</p>bookRadical systematic review of religion and spirituality in three NursingPsychiatric NursingreligionAn analysis of research on religious and spiritual variables in three major mental health nursing journals, 1991-1995A review of quantitative research studies published between 1991 and 1995 in 3 major mental health nursing journals revealed that approximately 10% (31 of 311) included a measure of religion or spirituality.

It argues that nurses have not taken seriously enough the recent criticism of the nature and role of spirituality in nursing. Not to listen to the 'enemies' of spirituality-in-nursing is to risk stagnation and a drift into obscurity. BACKGROUND: The area of spirituality has become a growing field of interest for nurses and has produced a burgeoning body of research literature. Yet, whilst much has been written about the positive aspects of spirituality, nurses have offered almost no critique of the ways in which spirituality and spiritual care are understood, despite the fact that there are clearly certain key issues that require robust critique and thoughtful reflection. Almost all of the major criticisms of spirituality-in-nursing have come from people outside of the discipline of nursing. The paper argues that nurses need to listen carefully to the criticisms of spirituality and spiritual care offered by the 'enemies' of spiritual care in nursing. When listened to constructively, they highlight issues that are vital for the development and forward movement of this important area of nursing practice. METHODS: Literature review and critical reflection on current critiques of spirituality in nursing practice. CONCLUSIONS: The paper concludes that nurses need to begin to develop spirituality as a specific field of enquiry with its own bodies of knowledge, methodologies, assumptions and core disciplines.

Data were analyzed using the immersion/crystallization method and concept mapping. Mystical experience was conceptualized as a process incorporating initiation, occurrence, maturation, and integration of mystical experience. Essential qualities included sensory-motor perception, interaction with the supernatural, interaction with family members, conviction of reality, cognition, dynamic tension and emotional intensity. Nursing interventions included listening and support. Subjective nursing responses included tension, intimacy and empathy, sense of awe, autonomic responses, and appreciation of the mystical in everyday life.

The author attempts to define the phenomenon of spirituality, aware of the dilemma that many individuals face when thinking and reflecting on this very personal and intangible issue. To be spiritual is to become fully human, the article argues, and the reverse is also true. Spirituality in health is inextricable in each person's search for the discovery of the truth about self and the meaning and purpose of life. Healthy communities are the product of healthy individuals who sow spiritual seeds such as unconditional positive regard, acceptance, respect and dignity for the benefit and advancement of individuals and humankind as a whole. The global nature of the phenomenon of spirituality is also shown by using examples of people who demonstrate compassion and communion with other human beings, in other countries in times of suffering, war and disaster. Compassion and empathy is expressed and experienced for victims of earthquakes that happen miles from home and far removed from personal or religious beliefs. Yet at such times we are all connected in the tapestry of life by our own human spirituality and earthiness. Abstract themes like compassion and justice are treated in the text within the context of spirituality. The author argues that being just and fair means that all patients have the right to achieve spiritual healing regardless of their belief systems, culture or creed. The works of some spiritual philosophers are used to reflect on this integral aspect of human caregiving. Historical symbols of spirituality are examined. The need for nurses to explore and reflect on the paradoxical concepts involved in their own spirituality is highlighted. Nurses are the essential providers of care and, therefore, the paper argues, guardians of that essential humanity that ensures that patients never become less than full human beings, whatever their condition, faith, culture or belief, or whoever they may be.

BACKGROUND: Spirituality is a broad concept, and is highly subjective, multidimensional and difficult to define. Spirituality and religiousness are two separate concepts but have several common features. In mental health care, it is essential that nursing care be built on a holistic view, and the spiritual dimension has an important function in nursing care. The notion of spirituality is full of nuances, and in a multi-cultural society patients express their spirituality in different ways. METHOD: Data were collected by interviewing 12 strategically selected patients in mental health care and analysed according to a qualitative method inspired by the phenomenographic approach. The data were collected in 2003 in Sweden. FINDINGS: Three descriptive categories emerged: patients wish to have their spiritual needs addressed; patients must see to it that their spiritual needs are addressed; patients lack confidence in nurses with regard to discussing spirituality. The findings show that patients actively sought the assistance of nurses to meet their spiritual needs. They turned their thoughts inwards and found community with other patients, while nurses often avoided addressing the spiritual dimension. CONCLUSION: Nurses should work actively to seek new knowledge about how they can address patients' spiritual needs. It is also important that there be scope for discussing and reflecting on spiritual questions at the workplace. Additional research is needed to explore how knowledge about spirituality should be implemented in mental health care and nursing education.597-604Mar 2007Patients' conceptions of how the spiritual dimension is addressed in mental health reports a study to describe patients' conceptions of how the spiritual dimension is addressed in mental health care.

BACKGROUND: Spiritual care of patients/clients is expected of nurses and is reflected in nursing codes of ethics, nurse education guidelines, policy documents and nursing guidance. Recent years have seen a proliferation in nursing research in this area, particularly in the UK and North America, and now in other European countries. It seemed timely, therefore, to review this published research. METHOD: Included in the review were 47 original published nursing research papers identified from a CINAHL search and from a collection held by the author since 1983. Papers were sorted into five categories, a template to aid reviewing was produced and a short summary and critique of each paper was written. CONCLUSIONS: Research on spirituality and health needs to move forward in a systematic and co-ordinated way. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Hopefully, the research summarized in this paper will be useful to clinicians and nurse educators as they strive to incorporate spiritual care within their practice. In turn patients/clients and their families should benefit from care which is more holistic and addresses their deepest concerns and needs.852-862Jul 2006Spiritual paper gives an overview of nursing research papers published on spiritual care between 1983 and October 2005.

This review aims at identifying those spiritual coping strategies used by the believers and nonbelievers followed by implications for holistic nursing care. LITERATURE SEARCH: The CINAHL and MEDLINE CD Rom databases were searched, identifying literature published from 1975 onwards which amounted to 187 articles. The majority of the literature traced were found anecdotal with only few studies investigating directly spiritual coping strategies. Following scrutiny of the available articles, only five research studies explored directly the spiritual coping strategies used in various illness, four of which were conducted in USA and one in UK. Because of the small scale research studies, generalization of the findings of this review is limited to the samples used. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND: Research suggests that spiritual coping strategies, involving relationship with self, others, Ultimate other/God or nature were found to help individuals to cope with their ailments. This may be because of finding meaning, purpose and hope, which may nurture individuals in their suffering. Spirituality is oftenly referred by literature as being synonymous with religiosity. Thus the use of spiritual coping strategies is restricted to individuals who hold religious beliefs. However, the definition of spirituality indicates that this concept is broader than religiosity. The theories on stress-coping (Folkman & Lazarus 1984) and the numinous experience (Otto 1950) outline the rationale for the use of these strategies which are applicable to both the believers and nonbelievers. IMPLICATIONS: This review suggests that the onset of illness may render the individual, being a believer or nonbeliever to realize the lack of control over his/her life. However the use of spiritual coping strategies may enhance self-empowerment, leading to finding meaning and purpose in illness. This implies that holistic care incorporates facilitation of various spiritual coping strategies to safeguard the wholeness and integrity of the some of the limited nursing research-based literature, orientated towards the use of spiritual coping strategies in illness.

BACKGROUND: The term spiritual crisis has been used ambiguously in the literature, resulting in lack of clarity. A holistic approach includes spirituality in nursing care of the whole person. DATA SOURCES: Papers available online between 1998 and 2007 in the CINAHL, Medline and PsycInfo databases were retrieved for analysis. The search engine Google was also used to examine additional references to 'spiritual crisis'. REVIEW METHODS: Spiritual crisis, spiritual emergency and life crisis were the terms initially used to search each database. The search was expanded to include spirituality to draw more literature into the review. FINDINGS: Using Walker and Avant's method of concept analysis, a definition of spiritual crisis was identified. Spiritual crisis can be described as a unique form of grieving or loss, marked by a profound questioning of or lack of meaning in life, in which an individual or community reaches a turning point, leading to a significant alteration in the way life is viewed. Possible antecedents include sudden acute illness and loss of important relationships. Potential consequences may include physical and emotional responses. CONCLUSION: People with terminal illness, depression, and those who are grieving losses may be at special risk of spiritual crisis. The literature suggests an interdisciplinary approach, nurses' self-exploration of spirituality, and refraining from defining spirituality by religious affiliation as part of improving practice.454-461Feb paper is a report of an analysis of the concept of spiritual crisis.

Patient satisfaction surveys address this powerful aspect of care and nurses find themselves in the position of making an impact. The nurse is at the bedside when crisis occurs, both physical and spiritual. Superficial attention to matters of spirituality is no longer acceptable. Nurses need to examine spirituality within themselves and be available when the patients give the invitation to join them in the struggle for peace. The critical care unit is most vulnerable because the intensity of illness is so great. Conscious or unconscious, the patient needs human touch and consolation, which transcends technology. Indifference to this is all but negligence on the part of the nurse. Addressing this through careful care planning and joining the \"fellowship of pain\" brings the nurse into the healing process. \"Burnout\" decreases as care increases, and nurses experience the healing process themselves as well.214-2202003 Jul-SepSpirituality in critical an environment of compassion where patients feel that their emotional and spiritual needs are met is at the heart of holistic care.

BACKGROUND: The concept of spirituality in nursing has received a great deal of attention in recent years. However, despite many articles addressed to the issue, spiritual care remains poorly understood amongst nursing professionals and, as a result, spiritual needs are often neglected within the context of health care. METHODS: A series of focus groups was conducted to obtain the views of service users, carers and mental health nursing professionals about the concept of spirituality and the provision of spiritual care in mental health nursing. RESULTS: According to the views expressed in our focus groups, spiritual care relates to the acknowledgement of a person's sense of meaning and purpose to life which may, or may not, be expressed through formal religious beliefs and practices. The concept of spiritual care was also associated with the quality of interpersonal care in terms of the expression of love and compassion towards patients. Concerns were expressed that the ethos of mental health nursing and the atmosphere of care provision were becoming less personal, with increasing emphasis on the 'mechanics of nursing'. CONCLUSIONS: The perceived failure of service providers to attend adequately to this component of care may be symptomatic of a medical culture in which the more readily observable and measurable elements in care practice have assumed a prominence over the more subjective, deeply personal components. In order for staff to acknowledge these issues it is argued that a more holistic approach to care should be adopted, which would entail multidisciplinary education in series of focus groups was conducted to obtain the views of service users, carers and mental health nursing professionals about the concept of spirituality and the provision of spiritual care in mental health nursing.

BACKGROUND: Spirituality and cultural dimensions of care are considered to be integral to holistic care. The healing potentials of spiritual and cultural care are well documented. The commitment to the research programme came due to the concern within early literature on nursing that the provision of spiritual care for patients is inadequate. METHODS: The research programme used action research comprising largely qualitative approaches. As the holistic and multiperspective nature of spirituality and culture requires a multidisciplinary approach and flexibility of methodology, various research techniques were used. RESULTS: The findings from the research programme led to the development of theories, models and conceptual literature on spiritual and cultural care. In particular, two models evolved from the studies: the ASSET for spiritual cares education and training and the ACCESS for transcultural care practice. The critical incident studies provide insights into nurses' roles in spiritual care interventions. The phenomenological study highlights that chronically ill patients use spiritual strategies in coping with their illness. CONCLUSION: Overall, the paper offers a body of evidence that has an impact upon curriculum development in nurse education and nursing practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The ASSET model offers a framework for spiritual care education. The ACCESS model offers a framework for transcultural care practice. The critical incident studies map out nurses' roles in spiritual and cultural care with scope for development of care intervention models for the future. The coping mechanisms study highlights how patients use spiritual coping strategies such as prayer and other resources to cope with their chronic spite of an unjustified negative portrayal of Islam, it continues to grow at what is sometimes perceived as an unprecedented rate, having, it is estimated, one billion followers, i.e. one-fifth of the world's population.

Therefore, curriculum strategies are identified for putting into action educational programmes that address the needs of Muslims.</p>journalArticleMedicine, Health Care, and PhilosophyMed Health Care Van den BrandenStef BroeckaertBert The operationalisation of religion and world view in surveys of nurses' attitudes toward euthanasia and assisted suicideMost quantitative studies that survey nurses' attitudes toward euthanasia and/or assisted suicide, also attempt to assess the influence of religion on these attitudes. We wanted to evaluate the operationalisation of religion and world view in these surveys. In the Pubmed database we searched for relevant articles published before August 2008 using combinations of search terms. Twenty-eight relevant articles were found. In five surveys nurses were directly asked whether religious beliefs, religious practices and/or ideological convictions influenced their attitudes, or the respondents were requested to mention the decisional basis for their answers on questions concerning end-of-life issues. In other surveys the influence of religion and world view was assessed indirectly through a comparison of the attitudes of different types of believers and/or non-believers toward euthanasia or assisted suicide. In these surveys we find subjective religious or ideological questions (questions inquiring about the perceived importance of religion or world view in life, influence of religion or world view on life in general, or how religious the respondents consider themselves) and objective questions (questions inquiring about religious practice, acceptance of religious dogmas, and religious or ideological affiliation). Religious or ideological affiliation is the most frequently used operationalisation of religion and world view. In 16 surveys only one religious or ideological question was asked. In most articles the operationalisation of religion and world view is very limited and does not reflect the diversity and complexity of religion and world view in contemporary society. Future research should pay more attention to the different dimensions of religion and world view, the religious plurality of Western society and the particularities of religion in studies that survey nurses' attitudes toward euthanasia and/or assisted suicide also attempt to assess the influence of religion on these attitudes.

The therapies described in this article are examples of the many therapies available for nurses to consider when planning care for patients with chronic pain. The increasing body of scientific knowledge is providing more guidance about the efficacy of specific therapies. As with all interventions, ongoing evaluation about the effectiveness of a therapy for each patient is an important component of quality nursing care. Complementary therapies provide an avenue for nurses to be autonomous in furthering the relief of chronic pain, as many of these therapies fall within the domain of nursing. Incorporating selected therapies into the plan of care provides multiple opportunities for nurses to demonstrate caring, a premier characteristic of nursing. A number of the complementary therapies, such as journaling, hand massage, and imagery, can be taught to patients and their families, thus promoting self-care. Anecdotal evidence and findings from numerous smaller studies provide some support for the use of many complementary therapies to manage chronic pain or their use as adjuncts in the treatment regimen. Still, the nurse must weigh the risks and benefits before suggesting a therapy to a patient. Evaluating the effectiveness of the complementary therapy to promote comfort in patients with chronic pain is essential. Obtaining this information is not only critical to the care of a particular patient, but these data will assist nurses in learning more about specific therapies. Most importantly, nurses need to pursue research to further the scientific basis for many of the complementary therapies.495-508Sep 2003Complementary and alternative therapieshttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/145672052009-11-13 04:37:02NCBI have used complementary therapies for many years to relieve anxiety, promote comfort, and reduce or alleviate pain.

Spiritual/existential distress was one of 18 issues covered in a survey of oncologists' (n=94) and oncology nurses' (n=267) attitudes and practices regarding psychosocial issues. The survey included patient vignettes at good, moderate and poor prognosis levels, and questions regarding attitudes toward patient care, typical and ideal services, and expectation for impact. A substantial proportion of both oncologists (37.5%) and nurses (47.5%) identified themselves as primarily responsible for addressing spiritual distress in their setting. However, over 85% of both MDs and RNs felt that ideally a chaplain should address such issues. Working in an inpatient setting predicted that nurses, but not doctors, would confer with chaplains. When ranking spiritual distress as important to address in comparison to 17 other issues, only 11.8% of MDs and 8.5% of RNs ranked it in the top three for the poor prognosis vignette, with yet lower values with better prognoses. For the poor prognosis, younger MDs were more likely to address spirituality (r=-0.26) and were also more likely to address anxiety or depression (r=0.25) and family distress (r=0.20). For RNs, no such relationships appeared. Perceived impact was also a predictor of whether spirituality issues were addressed. These results suggest that spiritual distress experienced by cancer patients may be under-addressed due to time constraints, lack of confidence in effectiveness, and role uncertainty.451-4581999 Sep-Oct'I would providers are called upon to address a wide range of psychosocial issues, under increasing time constraints.

While much is made of the bio-psychosocial model of holistic care, reflecting the allopathic bias inherent in the Western medical model, the issue of spirituality is mostly neglected. Where acknowledged, spirituality is often limited to recording the client's religion. This article asserts that religion and spirituality are not synonymous, although spirituality might sometimes be reflected through religious practices. CONCLUSION: With the move towards provision of modern mental health services in the community, the community mental health nurse will increasingly care for individuals for whom the spiritual is part of their daily lives and not a symptom of their illness. This is set against the backdrop of a multicultural society and as such will call for holistic nursing skills.33-382002 the move towards provision of modern mental health services in the community, the community mental health nurse will increasingly care for individuals for whom the spiritual is part of their daily lives and not a symptom of their illness.</p>journalArticle ShermanD W Acquired Immunodeficiency supportNurses' willingness to care for AIDS patients and spirituality, social support, and death anxietyOBJECTIVE: Use Rogers' (1992) framework of the science of unitary human beings to examine relationships among spirituality, perceived social support, death anxiety, and nurses' willingness to care for AIDS patients. DESIGN: Descriptive, correlational. POPULATION, SAMPLE, SETTING: Population, female RNs in the New York City Metropolitan area who care for patients with AIDS. Convenience sample of 220 RNs who worked in eight hospitals either on AIDS-dedicated units (n = 88), or medical-surgical scatterbed units (n = 132) with a daily AIDS patient census of between 5% to 50%. Data were collected in 1992. MEASURES: Spiritual Orientation Inventory, the Personal Resource Questionnaire-85, the Templer Death Anxiety Scale, and the Willingness to Care for AIDS Patients Instrument. METHODS: Pearson product-moment correlations and hierarchical multiple regression analyses to test hypotheses. FINDINGS: Willingness to care for AIDS patients was positively correlated with spirituality and perceived social support, and negatively correlated with death anxiety. Death anxiety moderated the relationship between spirituality and willingness to care. In total, 17% of the variance in nurses' willingness to care for AIDS patients was explained. Additional regression analyses indicated that group membership as either an AIDS-dedicated nurse or medical-surgical nurse did not moderate or change hypothesized relationships. CONCLUSION: Because group membership explained 22% of the variance in willingness to care, the data indicate that group culture or professional identity should be further examined as predictors of nurses' willingness to care for AIDS patients. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Social support at work from administrators and colleagues, as well as the support from patients themselves is important to nurses and should be fostered.205-2131996http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/88545412009-11-12 22:29:43NCBI PubMedPMID: Rogers' (1992) framework of the science of unitary human beings to examine relationships among spirituality, perceived social support, death anxiety, and nurses' willingness to care for AIDS patients.

A grounded theory studyThe purposes of this study were to discover what spirituality means to patients recovering from an acute myocardial infarction and to identify patients' perceptions of how spirituality influences recovery. Using the Glaserian method, spiritual concepts were used for theory building. Spirituality was described as a life-giving force nurtured by receiving presence of the divine, family, friends, health care providers, and creation (core category). Supporting categories were: developing faith, discovering meaning and purpose, and giving the gift of self. Five phases to discovering meaning and purpose were: (a) facing mortality, (b) releasing fear and turmoil, (c) identifying and making lifestyle changes, (d) seeking divine purpose, and (e) making meaning in daily life. Spirituality influenced recovery by providing the participants with inner strength, comfort, peace, wellness, wholeness, and enhanced coping.

Very little of the research thus far has focused on spirituality, religion, and pain even though spiritual views have been intertwined with beliefs about pain and suffering throughout history. Spiritual views can have a substantial impact on patients' understanding of pain and decisions about pain management. The author reviews the research literature on spirituality and pain from a historical perspective. The analysis is concerned with how spirituality and religion have been used to construct a meaning of pain that shapes appraisal, coping, and pain management. The clinical implications include respectful communication with patients about spirituality and pain, inclusion of spirituality in education and support programs, integration of spiritual preferences in pain management where feasible and appropriate, consultation with pastoral care teams, and reflection by nurses about spirituality in their own lives. A discussion of research implications is included.66-86Jun 2007http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/176795862009-11-13 22:52:03NCBI PubMedPMID: 17679586The Canadian Journal of author reviews the research literature on spirituality and pain from a historical perspective.

DESIGN: Exploratory, qualitative. SETTING: Outpatients in the mid-central and southwestern United States. SAMPLE: 10 Caucasian women, ages 45-70, who completed initial treatment, were not undergoing treatment for recurrence, and were within five years of diagnosis for breast or ovarian cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. METHODS: Data collected during two semistructured interviews, coded and analyzed using grounded theory techniques. Frame of reference--symbolic interactionism. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Developmental processes of spirituality; responses to diagnosis, treatment, and survival of cancer. FINDINGS: Diagnosis of cancer threatened the meaning of the women's lives, resulting in a sense of disintegration. This problem was resolved through the basic social psychological process of Struggling With Paradoxes, a three-phase process of Deciphering the Meaning of Cancer for Me, Recognizing Human Limitations, and Learning to Live with Uncertainty. In phase I, the paradoxes focused on the possibility of death, distress, vulnerability, and maintaining connection. In phase II, the paradoxes involved confronting death, asking difficult questions, and letting go of ultimate control of their lives. In phase III, the paradoxes centered on uncertainty, redefining meaning, and identifying spiritual growth. Reintegration occurred over time, although when threatened by the possibility of recurrence, disintegration resurfaced for a time. CONCLUSIONS: Findings emphasize not only the importance of spirituality, but also that spiritual experience is individualized and developmental in nature. Spiritual growth occurs over time following the diagnosis of cancer and is not necessarily related to age. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Spiritual concerns may be painful for patients to address; spiritual caregiving requires an acknowledgment of need by the woman with cancer and a caring, sensitive caregiver. Nurses should be aware of the phases of spiritual development so that interventions can be designed to address individual needs that may vary over time.1534-15442001 To examine the process of spiritual development in women diagnosed with cancer within five years of initial treatment.

This approach proceeds by creating dichotomies and then prioritising one half of the dichotomy whilst rejecting the opposite term. Rationality itself is prioritised, for example, by contrasting it with the rejected opposite: irrationality. Expert clinical practice is, however, increasingly identified as being inclusive of more than merely rational ways of knowing and behaving. This paper is based on a post-structural study concerning changes to women's embodied sense of self during childbearing. We expose the limitations of pure rationality in the context of childbirth and use the concept of safety to exemplify the limitations that pure rationality imposes. The paper draws on philosophical and spiritual theory to present an analysis of ideas about mind, body, soul and spirit. The standard rational/irrational dichotomy is critiqued and contrasted with the embodied reality of nonrational experiences that are individual, contextual and 'in-the-moment'. Nonrational experiences are identified to be inclusive of power and knowledge that are both rational and nonrational. This revised conceptualisation provides a theoretical basis that allows for and promotes more possibilities and thus more holistic ways of knowing in midwifery. Our thesis is that midwives and women need to take conscious account of nonrational knowledge and power during the childbearing year. We argue that pure rational thinking limits possibilities by excluding the midwife's embodied ways of knowing along with the ways of knowing embodied by the woman. The inclusion of women's and midwives'nonrational ways of knowing in childbearing situations opens us up to knowledge and power that provides for a more complete, and therefore a more optimal, decision-making process.37-42Mar 2008http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/182438362009-11-13 23:37:22NCBI PubMedPMID: paper draws on philosophical and spiritual theory to present an analysis of ideas about mind, body, soul and spirit.

The purpose of this paper is to bring a 'transpersonal' frame to these non-ordinary states of consciousness (hereafter: NOSC). Transpersonal psychology is an interdisciplinary movement in Western science that studies 'religious', 'peak' or 'healing' experiences in different cultures and social contexts. Between 2001 and 2006 in Auckland, New Zealand, while engaged in anthropological fieldwork, I collected stories from mothers, fathers, and midwives who had participated in transpersonal events during childbirth. I will compare the local women's NOSC with ethnographic accounts of spirit-possession and its relationship to indigenous midwifery then revisit and reconstruct the witch-hunts of Medieval Europe from this perspective. Midwives are encouraged to learn to identify and support women's NOSC during labour and birth as many women find strength and wisdom by passing through these states in labour. The subject is also critical to men, whether they are present with women and birth as fathers or health professionals. The hoped for result of this inquiry is to revalorise NOSC among birth-giving mothers, and to educate birth attendants in this field.3-10Mar 2007Rumour of angels women can experience non-ordinary states of consciousness when childbearing.

A philosophy of holistic care of women should underpin education of student midwives and these concepts should be put across to the students in meaningful ways. In the formal midwifery curriculum this has been a neglected aspect (Hall, 2001) [Hall, J., 2001. Midwifery Mind and spirit: emerging issues of care. Books for Midwives, Oxford]. We have developed a teaching session on 'Spirituality and the meaning of birth'. A creative approach, using mediums of video, music, aroma and storytelling, combined with an opportunity for the students to express their selves through art have been utilised (Cameron, 1993) [Cameron, J., 1993. The Artists Way--A course in discovering and recovering your creative self. Pan Macmillan, London]. Although creative approaches in teaching arts based disciplines is well established, these approaches have not been evaluated for their effectiveness within midwifery education. We conducted a study which aimed to develop an understanding of student's views on the meaning of birth by examining creative work produced by the student midwives. This aspect is reported elsewhere. Further exploration through open-ended questionnaires was made of the effectiveness and value of the activity as a teaching method. This paper will describe the innovative teaching methods used. In addition student's views of birth established through their art and their views of the teaching session elicited through our research will be explored.416-424Nov 2007Teaching spirituality to of midwifery both as an art and a science requires methods of teaching students that will enhance this understanding.

BACKGROUND: Caring is known to be the essence of nursing but many health-care settings have become more culturally diverse. Caring has been examined mainly in the context of Western cultures. Muslims form one of the largest ethnic minority communities in Britain but to date, empirical studies relating to caring from an Islamic perspective is not well documented. Research conducted within the home of Islam would provide essential truths about the reality of caring for Muslim patients. DESIGN: Phenomenological descriptive. Methods. Six critical care nurses were interviewed from a hospital in Saudi Arabia. The narratives were analysed using Colaizzi's framework. RESULTS: The meaning of the nurses' experiences emerged as three themes: family and kinship ties, cultural and religious influences and nurse-patient relationship. The results indicated the importance of the role of the family and religion in providing care. In the process of caring, the participants felt stressed and frustrated and they all experienced emotional labour. Communicating with the patients and the families was a constant battle and this acted as a further stressor in meeting the needs of their patients. CONCLUSIONS: The concept of the family and the importance and meaning of religion and culture were central in the provision of caring. The beliefs and practices of patients who follow Islam, as perceived by expatriate nurses, may have an effect on the patient's health care in ways that are not apparent to many health-care professionals and policy makers internationally. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Readers should be prompted to reflect on their clinical practice and to understand the impact of religious and cultural differences in their encounters with patients of Islam denomination. Policy and all actions, decisions and judgments should be culturally derived.1565-1573Dec 2006Caring for patients describe the critical care nurses' experiences in caring for patients of Muslim denomination in Saudi Arabia.

DESIGN: Hermeneutic inquiry. SETTING: Two leading teaching hospitals in Taiwan. SAMPLE: 35 older patients with terminal cancer with a life expectancy of three months. METHODS: Participatory observation and in-depth interviews were the major data collection strategies. Hermeneutic inquiry was used to disclose, document, and interpret participants' lived experiences. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: The perceptions of older Taiwanese patients with terminal cancer and their particular healthcare needs across various transition stages. FINDINGS: Two constitutive patterns, \"caring for the mortal body\" and \"transcending the worldly being,\" each with three themes and a related transformational process emerged from the data analysis. Two foci of spiritual needs were discovering patients' concerns about their dying bodies and their worldly being and facilitating the transcendence of the spiritual being from the physical realm. CONCLUSIONS: Caring for older Taiwanese patients with terminal cancer and helping them transcend the fear of the unknown when they give up worldly being can produce insights into patients' primary concerns, perceptions, and spiritual needs to help them achieve a \"good\" death.

Some considerations towards an understanding of the Islamic perspectives on caringCaring from Islamic perspectives is not well versed in Eurocentric nursing literature. There is widespread misunderstanding of the concept and practice of Islam within the context of health care and nursing practice. The areas of contention, in the context of health care systems, are whether the western paradigm to nursing care and management are applicable to Muslims and non-Muslims in both Islamic and non-Islamic countries. What is lacking in some of the conceptual frameworks and models of care is not only the fundamental spiritual dimension of care, but also the significance of spiritual development of the individual towards healing.

One reason for nurses' lack of preparedness to provide spiritual interventions is that their basic education only minimally discusses spirituality and related issues. This is compounded by the problem that only sporadic reference to spiritual care is found in most nursing textbooks. This study was conducted to analyze the content related to spirituality in nursing textbooks in order to determine where spiritual care is addressed and evaluate its adequacy. A total of 50 textbooks from a wide variety of nursing specialty areas were selected from the most recent Brandon Hill list. These books were examined to assess the percentage of pages discussing spiritual issues and analyze inclusion of core content essential for nursing practice. Although there was considerable variation among the books from all specialty areas, overall, hospice/terminal care, fundamentals of nursing, health assessment/health promotion, and transcultural nursing textbooks provided the most information about spirituality and spiritual care. Textbooks focusing on professional issues, medical-surgical nursing, maternal-child health nursing, critical care nursing, and community health nursing contained the least spiritual content.

In so doing, Islam is demonstrated as a living and growing religion, transcending almost all races and cultures in many parts of the globe. The historical review of Islam suggests its pervasive impact on almost all aspects of life: affecting both the East and West. In spite of an unjustified negative portrayal of Islam, it continues to grow at what is sometimes perceived as an unprecedented rate, having, it is estimated, one-billion followers, i.e. one-fifth of the world's population. This signals the need for nurse education to take on board curriculum measures to incorporate spiritual and cultural dimensions in the care of Muslim patients. Therefore, curriculum strategies are identified for putting into action educational programmes that address the needs of Muslims.57-64; ASSET model offers a framework for spiritual care education.

Findings of this study suggest that although this body of literature provides comprehensive content about spirituality and spiritual care, there are some underlying conceptual problems. The clear demarcation between spirituality and religion creates problematic dichotomies between patients' individual and cultural selves and their cognitive and experiential selves. Defining spirituality primarily by positive emotional descriptors and cognitive capacity tends to pathologize the basic human experience of suffering and marginalize those most vulnerable in society.

The aim was to increase students' awareness about the essence of spirituality in care so as to enable them to implement holistic care. Spirituality may or may not incorporate religiosity. Thus, believers may have spiritual needs which may include religious needs whilst the atheists and agnostics may still have spiritual needs.

This article describes the content structure of the study unit based on the ASSET model (Narayanasamy, A., 1999. ASSET: a model for actioning spirituality and spiritual care education and training in nursing. Nurse Education Today 19, 274-285) and outlines the various teaching methods used. Following feedback from the first and second cohort groups in 2003 and 2004, respectively, the reviewed study unit was delivered to the third cohort group of students (n=65) in Semester 2 in the academic year 2004-2005. Apart from the use of traditional teaching methods, such as lessons and a seminar, other methods were used constantly throughout the study unit, for example, self-reflection exercises, case-studies and small group discussions to enhance learning. Recommendations are proposed to review the content of this study unit and to introduce other teaching methods for effective learning.550-562Jul 2008Teaching on the spiritual dimension in care to 'The spiritual dimension in care' had a Judeo-Christian orientation. It was introduced to the Diploma nursing curriculum at the University of Malta in the academic year 2002-2003. The aim was to increase students' awareness about the essence of spirituality in care so as to enable them to implement holistic care.</p>journalArticleThe Journal of Nursing care in a public institution: legal implications, standards of practice, and ethical obligationsThis article reviews the status of teaching spiritual care in a public institution of higher education. The resurgence of interest in spiritual care across the United States has spurred interest and expanded theories of spirituality within the nursing profession. Nursing education rose to the challenge of teaching spiritual care theories and interventions to students, despite the absence of policy to guide educators. However, differences between public and private educational institutions have led to variations in the teaching of spiritual care. In addition to the legal implications stemming from the need for separation of church and state, nurses must also be aware of their ethical obligations in order to teach spiritual care concepts appropriately. The accrediting agencies for nursing education programs and hospitals, as well as state licensure boards, foster high expectations for nurses to provide spiritual care. A call for research and policy development to guide nurse educators is also addressed in this article.33-38Jan 2007Teaching spiritual care in article reviews the status of teaching spiritual care in a public institution of higher education.</p>journalArticleJournal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners133J nurse practitioner students: the importance of the interconnection of mind, body, and spiritPURPOSE: To describe the author's experience in locating and implementing a spiritual assessment tool in teaching a first semester clinical nurse practitioner (NP) course. DATA SOURCES: Selected articles and responses of NP students to the use of the tool. CONCLUSIONS: A spiritual assessment is an important component of a comprehensive health assessment. The use of a formal structured protocol provides a framework for beginning students to become comfortable with sprirituality and spiritual assessments and to begin to recognize spiritual distress in clients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The protocol used in the course is very extensive and might not be practical in a busy practice setting. An alternative, 4-point assessment is provided.134-139Mar 2001Teaching spirituality describe the author's experience in locating and implementing a spiritual assessment tool in teaching a first semester clinical nurse practitioner (NP) course. Conclusions: A spiritual assessment is an important component of a comprehensive health ethical basis of teaching spirituality and spiritual care: a survey of student nurses perceptionsBACKGROUND: There is a professional requirement for student nurses to achieve competence in the delivery of spiritual care. However, there is no research exploring students nurses perceptions of being educated in these matters. AIM: This paper explores the ethical basis of teaching student nurses about the concepts of spirituality and spiritual care by reporting the findings from the first year of a 3 year investigation. DESIGN: An exploratory longitudinal design was used to obtain student nurses perceptions of spirituality and spiritual care as they progressed through a 3 year programme. METHOD: A questionnaire incorporating the Spirituality and Spiritual Care Rating Scale was distributed to 176 pre-registration nursing students undertaking either the Advanced Diploma or Bachelor of Science degree programmes. RESULTS: A response rate of 76.7% was obtained. Findings reveal that the majority of student nurses perceived spirituality to be a universal phenomenon of a type that can be associated with existentialism. Some students were very uncertain and apprehensive about being instructed in spiritual matters. CONCLUSION: A cohort of student nurses held similar understandings of spirituality to those presented in the nursing literature. However the results also suggest an overwhelming majority felt it was wrong for spirituality to imply that some people are better than others and most were uncertain whether spirituality was related to good and evil. RELEVANCE TO NURSE EDUCATION: The investigation reveals that there are a number of ethical concerns surrounding the teaching of spirituality to student nurses that need to be resolved.1002-1008Nov 2008The ethical basis of teaching spirituality paper explores the ethical basis of teaching student nurses about the concepts of spirituality and spiritual care by reporting the findings from the first year of a 3 year investigation.</p>journalArticleJournal of Clinical Nursing1812J Clin NursDOI 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02707.xISSN 1365-2702 ClarkeJanice A critical view of how nursing has defined spiritualityAIMS: To offer a detailed discussion of the issue of 'lack of critique' in the literature on spirituality in nursing. The discussion will include the limited use of sources from theology and religious studies and the demand to separate spirituality and religion and will go on to examine the consequences of the resulting approach. The drive for unique knowledge to further professionalisation and the demands of inclusiveness are suggested as possible reasons for the development of the current model. The dangers and pitfalls of definition are explored. The paper suggests that theology could provide insights into explaining spirituality. BACKGROUND: The last four decades have seen a proliferation of definitions of spirituality in the nursing literature. Recently, in response to their own concerns and prompts from outside the 'spirituality' community authors have suggested that we revisit this literature with a more critical stance. This paper is in response to that suggestion. During the course of a PhD supervised from a department of practical theology I have critically analysed the literature from several perspectives and this paper is one result of that review. DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: Critical reflection on how spirituality has been defined. CONCLUSION: The lack of critique has produced a bias in the literature towards broad, generic, existential definitions which, together with the intentional divorce from religion and theology have led to definitions which have the tendency to result in a type of spiritual care which is indistinguishable from psychosocial care, hard to explain to patients and difficult to put into practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The acceptance of a diverse range of understandings of spirituality and a greater focus on practical ways of using it in nursing care are the direction the profession should be moving into.1666-1673Jun 2009http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/196461132009-11-14 ResearchReligion and MedicinespiritualityA review of spiritual and religious measures in nursing research journals: 1995-1999Background: A series of systematic reviews has revealed relatively high levels of interest in religion and spirituality in different nursing specialties, but not in general nursing research journals. Purpose: To identify the extent to which spirituality and religiousness were measured in all quantitative and qualitative research articles published in Research in Nursing and Health, Nursing Research, Advances in Nursing Science (ANS), and Image: The Journal of Nursing Scholarship from 1995 to 1999. Methods: A full-text search was conducted of ANS and Image using the Ovid search system. Nursing Research and Research in Nursing and Health were hand searched for spiritual/religious measures. Characteristics of selected studies, the measures taken, and their uses were coded for data analysis. Results: A total of 564 research studies were identified, of which 67 (11.9%) included at least one measure of spirituality or religiousness. A significant difference was found between the percentage of qualitative and quantitative studies that contained measures of these concepts. Of the 119 qualitative studies, 23 (19.3%) contained a measure of religion or spirituality, compared to 44 of the 445 (9.9%) quantitative studies. Nominal indicators of religious affiliation were the most commonly used measures in the quantitative studies and measures of religion and spirituality were rarely used in the analyses. Although only a few quantitative or qualitative studies intended to focus on religion or spirituality, these themes often emerged spontaneously in the qualitative research. Conclusions: Research in Nursing and Health, Advances in Nursing Science, Nursing Research, and Image: The Journal of Nursing Scholarship all published research measuring spirituality and religiousness during the time-period studies. The rate at which spirituality and religion appeared in these nursing research articles is substantially higher than that found in most fields outside of nursing. Even more frequent inclusion of spiritual and religious variables and richer measures of spirituality and religiousness would help to increase the available scientific information on the role of spirituality and religion in nursing care.55-662005A review of spiritual and religious measures in nursing identify the extent to which spirituality and religiousness were measured in all quantitative and qualitative research articles published in Research in Nursing and Health, Nursing Research, Advances in Nursing Science (ANS), and Image: The Journal of Nursing Scholarship from 1995 to 1999.</p>journalArticle NarayanasamyA Holistic NursingHumansPsychological TheoryPsychophysiologyReligion and MedicineA review of spirituality as applied to nursingIn this paper a review of spirituality as applied to nursing is carried out.

A multidisciplinary cooperative inquiry group met during 1997 and 1998 to explore this issue. The aim of the group was to 'explore spirituality with a view to how that informs our work'. Group members understood spirituality to be a unique potential that forms an integral part of every human being. Key themes through which spirituality may be expressed are the search for meaning or purpose and a sense of connection.

BACKGROUND: With the growing interest in spirituality in healthcare, has come the inevitable task of trying to conceptualise spirituality, a daunting task given the amorphous nature of spirituality, the changing understandings of spirituality among individuals and the diverse globalised society within which this task is taking place. Spirituality's relationship to religion is a particularly challenging point of debate. DESIGN: Critical review. CONCLUSIONS: Three social and historical conditions - located in the context of Western thought - have contributed to current conceptualisations of spirituality and religion: the diminishment of the social authority of religion as a result of the Enlightenment focus on reason, the rise of a postmodern spirituality emphasising spiritual experience and current tensions over the ideological and political roles of religion in society. The trend to minimise the social influence of religion is a particular Western bias that seems to ignore the global megatrend of the resurgence of religion. Current conceptualisations are critiqued on the following grounds: that they tend to be ungrounded from a rich history of theological and philosophical thought, that a particular form of elitist spirituality is emerging and that the individualistic emphasis in recent conceptualisations of spirituality diminishes the potential for societal critique and transformation while opening the door for economic and political self interest. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Constructing adequate conceptualisations of spirituality and religion for clinical practice entails grounding them in the wealth of centuries of philosophical and theological thinking, ensuring that they represent the diverse society that nursing serves and anchoring them within a moral view social and historical conditions - located in the context of Western thought - have contributed to current conceptualisations of spirituality and religion: the diminishment of the social authority of religion as a result of the Enlightenment focus on reason, the rise of a postmodern spirituality emphasising spiritual experience and current tensions over the ideological and political roles of religion in society.</p>journalArticleJournal implications for nursing practiceBACKGROUND: This research outlines some preliminary findings emerging from a grounded theory investigation into the 'meaning of spirituality'. These initial results raise some important questions about the terminology and language that nurses use regarding the term spirituality. It seems that many of the policy directives and statutory guidelines make two major assumptions regarding 'spirituality'. Firstly, patients and nurses are aware and understand the concept, and secondly, patients may require their spiritual needs to be met. These preliminary findings suggest that a dichotomy is emerging between professional assumption and patient expectation regarding the meaning of spirituality. AIM: The study had one broad research aim, to gain a deeper insight into how patients, nurses, and people from the major world religions understand the concept of 'spirituality'. DESIGN: A qualitative research design was used involving a grounded theory method of inquiry. It was felt that this qualitative method would aid the investigation of this subjective dimension of peoples' existence, enabling existing theoretical constructs and arguments to be tested. METHODS: The constant comparative method was used throughout the data collection and analysis. Analysis was undertaken at two levels, 'overview analysis' and 'line-by-line analysis'. This enabled the creation of categories and central themes. RESULTS: Constant comparative analysis resulted in the formation of several categories and central themes. Two categories presented and discussed in detail are 'definitions of spirituality', and 'diverse perceptions of spirituality'. CONCLUSION: It would seem that there is now an urgent need for nursing to evaluate and perhaps adjust its vision regarding what constitutes spirituality. Such an approach may serve to reduce the gap between policy and public expectation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It seems that there may be no 'precise' terminology associated with the language used to define spirituality, raising possible implications for nursing practice and nurse education.934-941Nov research outlines some preliminary findings emerging from a grounded theory investigation into the 'meaning of spirituality'.

There are significant disputes in the literature regarding the methodological quality of research in this area. Despite nursing scholars' interest in this area, no thorough review of the methodological critiques is available. The purpose of this study is to review areas of methodological difficulty in the study of religiosity and spirituality by identifying contemporary methodological critiques, critically evaluating the critiques and the underlying issues, and making suggestions for methodological advancement in the field. Three main areas of methodological critique exist: construct measurement, study design, and data analysis. Research in this area should aim for conceptual clarity, deliberate design, and appropriate analysis. Considerations of these critiques are instructive for nursing research done in the area of religiosity and of this study is to review areas of methodological difficulty in the study of religiosity and spirituality by identifying contemporary methodological critiques, critically evaluating the critiques and the underlying issues, and making suggestions for methodological advancement in the field.

Following concept analysis procedures, definitions were selected from journal articles and textbooks and the key words in the definitions were listed in order of frequency. In definitions of religion, six words appeared most frequently--system, beliefs, organized, person, worship, practices; in definitions of spirituality, nine words appeared most frequently--personal, life, principle, animator, being, God (god), quality, relationship, transcendent. Only the word person(al) appeared on both lists. Using these two lists, the words (defining attributes) that appeared most frequently were formed as consensus definitions. It was concluded that spirituality is currently the broader term and may subsume aspects of religion. If these concepts are not clearly defined, the care related to personal life principles, relationships, and transcendent experiences may be confused with care for personal beliefs and worship practices.41-471992 Jan-Febhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15731152009-11-12 22:13:03NCBI PubMedPMID: 1573115Journal of Professional Nursing: Official Journal of the American Association of Colleges of nursing literature published from 1963 to 1989 was screened for definitions to distinguish the concept of religion from that of spirituality.

A total of 90 references were reviewed, including 73 nursing and health-related references. Concept analysis findings revealed that spirituality was defined within four main themes in the nursing and health-related literature: (a) spirituality as religious systems of beliefs and values (spirituality = religion); (b) spirituality as life meaning, purpose, and connection with others; (c) spirituality as nonreligious systems of beliefs and values; and (d) spirituality as metaphysical or transcendental phenomena.252-262; purpose for conducting this concept analysis, guided by Walker and Avant's methodology, was to (a) examine how spirituality has been used within the current body of nursing and health-related literature, (b) clarify the meaning of spirituality by discovering what this concept's current critical attributes/characteristics are, and (c) propose a definition of spirituality based on the concept analysis findings.</p>journalArticleJournal of Holistic Nursing: Official Journal of serenity scale: a psychometric analysis of a measure of spirituality and well-beingPURPOSE: This article describes a factor analysis of a 22-item version of the Serenity Scale, a tool that measures spirituality and well-being. METHOD: A sample of 87 participants, enrolled in a National Institutes of Health-funded clinical trial examining the impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction on symptom management post-solid organ transplantation, completed the abbreviated instrument. FINDINGS: Exploratory factor analysis yielded three subscales: acceptance, inner haven, and trust. The Serenity Scale was positively associated with positive affect and mindful awareness and inversely related to negative affect, anxiety, depression, health distress and transplant-related stress. CONCLUSIONS: Serenity, a dimension of spirituality that is secular and distinct from religious orientation or religiosity, shows promise as a tool that could be used to measure outcomes of nursing interventions that improve health and well-being. IMPLICATIONS: Spirituality is recognized as being an essential component of holistic nursing practice. As nurses expand their use of spiritual interventions, it is important to document outcomes related to nursing care. The Serenity Scale appears to capture a dimension of spirituality, a state of acceptance, inner haven and trust that is distinct from other spirituality instruments.7-16Mar 2009The article describes a factor analysis of a 22-item version of the Serenity Scale, a tool that measures spirituality and well-being.

'Spirituality' is a term that is increasingly used in nursing but there may be problems about exactly what the term means and how it is interpreted and understood by both nurses and patients. AIM: The aim of the paper is to explore some of the commonly cited definitions to establish if the concept of spirituality could be termed 'universal'. METHOD: This paper presents a discussion, based upon a literature review, of the nursing and health care databases, combined with manual searches. The review demonstrates how the term spirituality is being constructed within nursing suggesting that there are numerous definitions each with several layers of meaning. FINDINGS: From the review the authors have developed 'a spiritual taxonomy' that may explain and accommodate the different layers of meaning found within nursing and health care definitions. At the extreme left there is a spirituality based on religious and theist ideals, while at the extreme right there is a spirituality based upon secular, humanistic, existential elements. A middle way is explained containing elements from both the left and right but not as fundamental or radical. CONCLUSION: The authors argue that because there are so many definitions with different layers of meanings, spirituality can imply different things depending upon an individual's personal interpretation or worldview. The results of the review suggest nursing is constructing a 'blanket' definition of spirituality, which has a broad, almost inexhaustible set of defining characteristics. If this approach continues then there is a danger that the word may become so broad in meaning that it loses any real significance.151-161Feb 2004The paper explores the relationships that exist between the language used to describe spirituality within nursing and the appropriateness of constructing a universal definition acceptable to all individuals.

Despite the renewed interest and growing literature on spirituality, there is no consensus on a definition of this concept. There is also ambiguity on how this concept is incorporated into nursing practice, research, and education. AIM: This paper aims to contribute toward clarification of the meaning of spirituality in relevance to health and nursing today through a conceptual analysis process. METHODS: Information was obtained through dictionary definitions and electronic database searches of literature on spirituality spanning the past 30 years. The criteria for selection included scholarly articles and books with a definition of spirituality, and research studies that investigated the meaning of spirituality to individuals' health. A total of 76 articles and 19 books were retrieved for this analysis. FINDINGS: Spirituality is an inherent component of being human, and is subjective, intangible, and multidimensional. Spirituality and religion are often used interchangeably, but the two concepts are different. Spirituality involves humans' search for meaning in life, while religion involves an organized entity with rituals and practices about a higher power or God. Spirituality may be related to religion for certain individuals, but for others, such as an atheist, it may not be. CONCLUSION: In order to provide clarity and enhance understanding of this concept, this analysis delineates antecedents, attributes, constructed case examples, empirical referents, and consequences of spirituality. A proposed definition of spirituality emerged from this process, which may be applied broadly. Implications for nursing practice, education, and research are paper aims to contribute toward clarification of the meaning of spirituality in relevance to health and nursing today through a conceptual analysis process.</p>journalArticleExplore training and supporting hospice volunteers: a prospective study of spiritual practice, well-being, and fear of deathBACKGROUND: Inspired by a 2,500-year-old Buddhist tradition, the Zen Hospice Project (ZHP) provides residential hospice care, volunteer programs, and educational efforts that cultivate wisdom and compassion in service. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to understand how being with dying hospice residents affects hospice volunteers well-being and the role of spiritual practice in ameliorating the fear of death. DESIGN: A one-year longitudinal study of two volunteer cohorts (N = 24 and N = 22) with repeated measures of spiritual practice, well-being, and hospice performance during one-year service as volunteers. SETTING: The Zen Hospice Guest House and Laguna Honda Residential Hospital of San Francisco, CA. PARTICIPANTS: All 46 individuals who became ZHP volunteers during two years. INTERVENTIONS: A 40-hour training program for beginning hospice volunteers stressing compassion, equanimity, mindfulness, and practical bedside care; a one-year caregiver assignment five hours per week; and monthly group meeting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-report FACIT spiritual well-being, general well-being, volunteer coordinator-rated ZHP performance scale. RESULTS: The volunteers had a high level of self-care and well-being at baseline and maintained both throughout the year; they increased compassion and decreased fear of death. Those (n = 20) practicing yoga were found to have consistently lower fear of death than the group average (P = .04, P = .008, respectively). All rated the training and program highly, and 63% continued to volunteer after the first year's commitment. The results suggest that this approach to training and supporting hospice volunteers fosters emotional well-being and spiritual growth.304-3132006 Jul-AugA contemplative present study was designed to understand how being with dying hospice residents affects hospice volunteers well-being and the role of spiritual practice in ameliorating the fear of death.

Such care incorporates not only physical, emotional, and psychosocial care, but spiritual care as well. Even though considerable attention has been directed to spiritual issues for adult patients in hospice and palliative care, spirituality in pediatric palliative care has been virtually neglected. The need for guidelines to assess spirituality in this population was identified as a priority issue by members of a subcommittee of the Children's International Project on Children's Palliative/Hospice Services, created under the auspices of the National Hospice Organization. Committee members, based on their clinical, research, and personal experiences, identified several aspects relevant to spirituality in general, and to spirituality in pediatric palliative care in particular, and developed guidelines for clinicians in pediatric palliative care. The purpose of this paper is to share the results of this committee's work and, in particular, to present their guidelines for addressing spiritual issues in children and families in pediatric hospice though considerable attention has been directed to spiritual issues for adult patients in hospice and palliative care, spirituality in pediatric palliative care has been virtually neglected. The need for guidelines to assess spirituality in this population was identified as a priority issue by members of a subcommittee of the Children's International Project on and on a palliative care team: a pilot studyAnecdotal evidence suggests that death may be heralded by deathbed phenomena (DBP) such as visions that comfort the dying and prepare them spiritually for death. Medical practitioners have been slow to recognize DBP, and there has been little research into the spiritual effect that DBP have on caregivers or on how these phenomena influence their work. A pilot study looking into the occurrence of DBP was conducted by the palliative care team at Camden Primary Care Trust. Interviews revealed that patients regularly report these phenomena as an important part of their dying process, and that DBP are far broader than the traditional image of an apparition at the end of the bed. Results of the interviews raise concerns about the lack of education or training to help palliative care teams recognize the wider implications of DBP and deal with difficult questions or situations associated with them. Many DBP may go unreported because of this. Results of this pilot study also suggest that DBP are not drug-induced, and that patients would rather talk to nurses than doctors about their experiences.17-242006 Jan-FebDeathbed phenomena and their effect on a palliative care PubMedPMID: evidence suggests that death may be heralded by deathbed phenomena (DBP) such as visions that comfort the dying and prepare them spiritually for death.

In the past 30 years, however, with the advent of what has been termed the cognitive revolution, psychology has greatly expanded the scope of its subject matter. Psychologists and thanatologists have begun to unravel the cognitive underpinnings of our assumptive world and the transformation of those underpinnings in times of crisis and stress. This article examines the cognitive basis of the spiritual experience and the use of cognitive assimilation, accommodation strategies during the process of mourning the death of a loved one, as well as during the process of living our own dying. Of special importance to mental health professionals and clergy, new research on dying, mourning, and spirituality suggests that the specific ways in which people rediscover meaning--such as belief in traditional religious doctrine, the afterlife, reincarnation, philanthropy, or a spiritual order to the universe--may be less important than the process itself. In other words, in the midst of dealing with profound loss in our lives, the ability to reascribe meaning to a changed world through spiritual transformation, religious conversion, or existential change may be more significant than the specific content by which that need is filled.495-519Sep article examines the cognitive basis of the spiritual experience and the use of cognitive assimilation, accommodation strategies during the process of mourning the death of a loved one, as well as during the process of living our own dying.</p>journalArticleThe American Journal of StaffPastoral CareMidwifery to the soul while the body dies: spiritual care among hospice nursesBecause attitudes and beliefs about spiritual care have been linked with spiritual caregiving practices in previous research among non-hospice nurses, and because little is known about hospice nurses' attitudes and beliefs about spiritual care, this study explored such attitudes and beliefs among hospice nurses. Data were obtained from 641 Hospice Nurses Association members who completed the Spiritual Care Perspectives Survey and a demographic form.

Family members of the patient often are included in the care and services provided by the hospice team, and hospice clinicians face a special challenge when working with families of patients who are imminently dying. When loved ones are anticipating the patient's impending death, they may find it difficult to express feelings, thoughts, and last wishes. Music therapy is a service modality that can help to facilitate such communication between the family and the patient who is actively dying, while also providing a comforting presence. Music therapy as a way to ease communication and sharing between dying patients and their loved ones is discussed in this article. The ways in which music therapy can facilitate a means of release for both patients and family members in an acute care unit of a large US hospice organization are specifically described. Case descriptions illustrate how music therapy functioned to allow five patients and their families to both come together and let go near the time of death. Elements to consider when providing such services to imminently dying patients and their families are discussed.129-1342003 Mar-AprMusic therapy with imminently ones are anticipating the patient's impending death, they may find it difficult to express feelings, thoughts, and last wishes.

Clin. North and implicationsThe influence of religious beliefs and practices at the end of life is underinvestigated. Given nursing's advocacy role and the intimate and personal nature of the dimensions of religiosity and the end of life, exploring the multidimensional interplay of religiosity and end-of-life care is a significant aspect of the nurse-patient relationship and must be better understood. The question that must be faced is whether nurses' own belief systems impinge on or influence patient care, especially for patients who are at the end of life. When nurses understand their own beliefs and respect the religious practices and needs of patients and their families, it deepens the humanistic dimensions of all hospice professionalsThis research examines spirituality as an aspect of professional practice. A questionnaire on spirituality was sent in 1991 to the hospice directors in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The findings strongly indicate that spirituality is important in the hospice setting and plays a prominent role in the treatment of patients. Also, hospice programs were found to be supportive of the spiritual component of care. The spiritual approaches used by the respondents were the more traditionally religious ones such as listening to the patient talk about God or referring to clergy. Approaches such as meditation or guided imagery, which are not necessarily related to religion, were used less frequently. Clergy in the study placed greater importance on spirituality in hospice work and used more traditionally religious approaches than did non-clergy. While some professional caregivers choose to leave spiritual matters to clergy, the findings reveal that many non-clergy hospice professionals are assisting patients research examines spirituality as an aspect of professional practice.

Clin. to the spiritual needs of the chronically illThe steps of the nursing process apply to needs of the spirit as well as body and mind. Several nurses have provided guidelines for assessing spiritual needs. Stoll, for example, considers four areas of concern: the person's concept of God; source of strength and hope; significance of religious practices and rituals; and perceived relationship between spiritual beliefs and state of health. In approaching the patient about these four areas, it is important for the nurse to clearly articulate the purpose in seeking such information. For instance, a nurse might explain to a patient that research has demonstrated the positive relationship of spiritual concerns to a patient's ability to cope with chronic illness. Because the nurse is interested in assisting the patient to identify, strengthen, and develop a variety of coping strategies, spiritually related data are relevant to the patient's care. Having collected data from the patients, a nursing diagnosis can be made. Spiritual concerns, spiritual distress, and spiritual despair have been included in the accepted classification system. Meeting the spiritual needs of patients can be uncomfortable for the nurse. Several reasons for such discomfort include embarrassment, the belief that it is not the nurse's role, lack of training, and the lack of own spiritual resources. Experience with an elective course in spirituality for undergraduate nursing students would support the value of offering training. Discussing God-related issues can assist a health care professional to clarify a personal spiritual position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)603-611Sep needs of persons with advanced cancerSpiritual needs, spiritual distress, and spiritual well-being of patients with terminal illnesses can affect their quality of life. The spiritual needs of patients with advanced cancer have not been widely studied. This study assessed the spiritual needs of 90 patients with advanced cancer who were newly admitted to hospice home care. They completed a demographic data form and the Spiritual Needs Inventory shortly after hospice admission. Scores could range from a low of 17 to a high of 85; study scores were 23 to 83. Results showed great variability in spiritual needs. Being with family was the most frequently cited need (80%), and 50% cited prayer as frequently or always a need. The most frequently cited unmet need was attending religious services. Results suggest the importance of a focus on the spiritual more than the religious in providing care to patients at the end of spiritual distress, and spiritual well-being of patients with terminal illnesses can affect their quality of life.

METHODS: In this article, spiritual pain is defined as \"pain caused by extinction of the being and the meaning of the self,\" and its structure was evaluated according to the three dimensions of the human being, that is, a being founded on temporality, a being in relationship, and a being with autonomy. RESULTS: As a result, spiritual pain of patients with terminal cancer could be described as meaninglessness of life, loss of identity, and worthlessness of living derived from loss of the future, loss of others, and loss of autonomy of a dying individual. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: On the basis of these understandings, the author deduced principles of spiritual care of terminally ill cancer patients as recovery of the future beyond death, others beyond death, and autonomy toward death in each dimension of the human being.15-21Mar 2003Spiritual pain and its care in patients with terminal PubMedPMID: article, spiritual pain is defined as \"pain caused by extinction of the being and the meaning of the self,\" and its structure was evaluated according to the three dimensions of the human being, that is, a being founded on temporality, a being in relationship, and a being with autonomy.

Although other hospice team members may be involved in matters of faith with patients, chaplains are the primary professionals concerned with the transcendent nature of life and the integrative role that spirituality plays in care for the dying. Understanding spirituality in a person's living and dying requires an understanding of religion and theology. Religion is meant to connect us to a caring community and to give us a place on which to stand--a tradition. Theology is a search for meaning. Spirituality is \"the life principle that pervades a person's entire being ... and generates a capacity for transcendent values.\" The body cannot be touched without the spirit's being affected, and vice versa. Efforts to help patients toward wholeness necessitate helping them accept freely their whole lives. The chaplain is not limited to nor bound by religious language. The needs of the patient should determine the use of prayer or God-talk. Listening is one of the greatest spiritual gifts a chaplain can give a suffering patient. Being a companion is often all the chaplain can do. Pastoral care personnel are also sensitive to the needs of the hospice staff. The chaplain does not so much fulfill a role as represent a perspective based on concern and solicitude for the whole person, the whole family unit, the whole in a person's living and dying requires an understanding of religion and theology.

His parish nurse program brings nurses onto congregations' staffs to work as ministers of health on a part-time or full-time basis. In this way congregations can play an increasingly important role in keeping people spiritually and physically healthy and giving leadership in the field of preventive medicine. Parish nurses serve as health educators, health counselors, volunteer trainers, and support group organizers. In hundreds of congregations, this program has been well received by clergy and church members.1990-11-01144enISBN 9780806624587The parish KoenigHarold Medical / GeneralMedical / Nursing / Fundamentals & SkillsMedical / Nursing / GeneralMedical / Nursing / Home CareParish nursingParish nursing/ medicineReligion / CounselingParish nursing: stories of service and careParish nursing presents a new approach to healthcare as well as pastoral care, linking together the spiritual and medical communities.

A descriptive study was conducted in the intermountain West to determine how faith communities form parish nursing programs and what their effect is. Thirteen congregations representing eight denominations with parish nurse/health ministries participated. Parish nurses, parish nurse coordinators from two medical centers, pastors, and hospital chaplains (n = 24) were interviewed and provided documents from their programs. Over time, congregations formed parish nursing/health ministries using strategies in a developmental process. The process involved significant support from the pastor, congregation members, and the parish nurses. Collaboration between faith communities and health organizations were successful using a limited domain approach to attain specific health goals. Parish nursing is making a contribution to integrating faith and health practices, promoting health, and increasing accessibility to health care and congregational activities.

Parish nurses provide care to a faith community, emphasizing the relationship between faith and health. Specific nursing activities address physical, emotional, and spiritual health and well-being, closely attending to the inseparability of these dimensions. Parish nurses may assume one or more roles associated with this practice to accomplish parish nursing activities and achieve the holistic health and well-being of individuals, families, and groups within the faith community.
