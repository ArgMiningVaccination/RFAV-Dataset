As it was not too long ago that we found ourselves in your shoes, we know just how difficult it is to find your bearings in a new environment. For this reason , the current students and faculty at UCI have banded together to create the UCI SOM Welcome Guide. We hope that this student- initiative will prove useful in answering all of the little logistical questions that come up as you take your first concrete steps into the world of medicine. This guide should not only serve as a resource as you begin to look for housing in the area and learn about the curriculum that you will be taking part in, but also serve as a reference throughout the year for some of the best \"things to do\" in and around Irvine as you find yourself with random bits of free time throughout the year. Want to get to know your class mates better? Check out the dining section and invite someone new out for a bit e to eat. Need to clear your mind from school a little? Check out the local getaways section to see where up perclassmen like to go for stay -cations. Have no idea how to get involved on campus? Check out the Student Life section to get in contact with the interest groups and organizations that stand out to you . It is our hope that w hen you get to UCI , you'll be ready to hit the ground running J . As previously mentioned, this guide is a compilation of thoughts, ideas, and expertise from all throughout UCI SOM. The administrative staff and your future classmates and colleagues have all contributed to making this guide possible . It is an incredible honor to be your first introduction to our school, and we can't wait to welco me you to our Anteater Family in the Fall. Until Then, Bima, Megan, and Pejman Dear Students, Welcome and once again congratulations. I am delighted you will be joining us and look forward to working with you during your tenure as a medical student at UC Irvine. We hope UC Irvine may become your \"home away from home\" and that you find this to be a place where you can not only learn, but also continue to develop the unique characteristics that brought you here in the first place. You will be taking your medical school journey with some amazing individuals, so enjoy the ride! Like the students that have come together to make this guide, I encourage you to become part of our community and get involved in activities that you enjoy. Being a medical student will be your \"full time job\" for the next four years but when not studying there are many student a ctivities that will help you stay balanced and fit. There are activities for everyone ranging from our more artistic groups such as PLEXUS or the UC MEDleys to our athletic pursuits \u2014 whether they be intramural or interschool rivalries in basketball, flag f ootball or soccer. Exploring your medical and non -medical affinities is a great way to get involved and get to know your classmates. To introduce you to our medical school community our first year students have developed this Welcome Guide to help you na vigate your way through getting settled at UC Irvine. They will share with you their gems on where to shop, bike, live, etc. They have worked hard on this guide during breaks and in between studying, so I sincerely hope you benefit from it. Next year bring your ideas for this reference; share what you have learned this year so that others can benefit from your experience. The Admissions team is here to help you as we approach matriculation. Please do not hesitate to contact us at any time! Take Care, Ellena Peterson.

You can hop into your car and drive to the UCI Medical Center, research, grocery store, the ARC, etc. after just a short walk to the parking lot (instead of having to bike/shuttle back to your apartment before making the trip towards your ultimate destination). The parking permit you will need for the medical campus is a $70, \"S Zone Commuter\" permit for \"Zone 2\" (below is a map of the different zones on campus). This pass will allow you to park in lots 82, 83, 84, 35, ARC, and CT. If you are feeling extra fancy or extra pressed for time, permits for AR Reserved spots ($90) are available for a parking spots located a little closer to campus. However, an AR permit is usually never necessary. Additionally, all day on weekends and after 5pm on Monday-Friday, all \"S Zone Commuter\" permits are able to park in AR Reserved spots. After 3pm on Monday-Friday, all \"S Zone Commuter\" permits will be able to park in all S Zone parking lots (and not just \"Zone 2\"). With that being said, here are a couple more pro-tips and testimonials on parking: \u00fc \"I pay for parking in 6-month stretches so I don't have to keep going back to the (usually very busy) parking office.\" \u00fc \"Try to buy a parking permit before your first day of class so you're not all trying to buy them on the same day.\" \u00fc \"Every parking lot on campus has pay-by-space options where you can pay to park there for a day or for a few hours etc.\" \u00fc \"Nighttime parking in Zone 2 lots is technically only from 5pm-12am I believe. I have never gotten a ticket when I was parked past 12am at school.\" \u00fc \"Some people park at the Starbucks/office building parking lot on the corner of California and Bison to avoid paying for parking. The lot has signs saying 'NO UCI Parking.' People say different things about the risk of getting ticketed if you park there. It is a 10 min walk to the med school.\" Driving & Parking at UCI MS1 events where you need a car (or a friend that has one): PACE Clinical Experience at UCIMC If you are interested in purchasing a parking pass, follow the steps below: 1. Get your student id card at the Ant Hill bookstore, where they take your picture. 2. Go online to the parking site and order your permit for Zone 2 parking spaces 3. Pick up your permit at one of several terminals located around campus For more information, visit https://www.parking.uci.edu/permits/studentpermits.cfm If you live close to campus, we highly suggest you download the Anteater Express app (available for apple & android) or check out the Anteater Express' website for more information. In short, the Anteater Express is a FREE** UCI-run shuttle system that circles a variety of loops around campus, Irvine, and Newport (seasonally). This is a great option for anyone that regularly bikes/walks but don't want to get their clothes sweaty on Clinical Foundation days (usually every Tuesdays and Thursdays). Additionally, there are bike racks on the Anteater Express if you ever need to take a bike wherever you are going! Buses come at fairly regular intervals on weekdays, but are unavailable on weekends. The only route that has stops at the medical school campus is the M Line. The route itself circles the entire UCI campus and takes 30 minutes each cycle. If you live on-campus on the east side, taking this route will get you to the medical school campus within 20 minutes (although plan to leave 30 minutes beforehand just in case). Sometimes, the shuttle can be overcrowded and you may need to wait for the next shuttle to arrive. There are buses that come by every 5 minutes and you can track accurate arrival times using the Anteater Express app. Taking the shuttle as an on-campus resident will allow you to save on purchasing a parking permit and you can still qualify for some free parking permits through the Sustainable Transportation Program! If you want to talk to someone that has used the Anteater Express, just feel free to e-mail Nam Thai, Class of 2019, at nkthai@uci.edu. **Some of the longer routes that leave UCI may have fares Anteater Express About 5% of the MS1 class take the Anteater Express to get to campus. Students living in UCI housing who have a car but are willing to avoid using it can sign up for the Sustainable Transportation program. This way you won't have to buy the monthly permit, but you will have a few passes on hand for rainy-days and exam mornings. With this program you can get unlimited weekend and evening passes to park on campus and a limited number of day-time passes. It takes 2-3 business days for your registration to get through, but as long as you meet the requirements you can get into the program. Find out more at: https://www.parking.uci.edu/AT/incentives/graduate.cfm Unfortunately, this perk is only available to students in on-campus housing. Sustainable Transportation Program UCI is a great campus for people at all levels to bike! There are bike lanes on the large walkways on campus as well as on the main streets around campus. The campus terrain has some hills that occasionally put the quadriceps to work, but overall, biking around UCI is not challenging. Biking from the farthest corner of campus to the medical school takes about 15 minutes, so if you bike from on-campus housing to class, you can expect it to be a shorter ride. For those of you worried about having your expensive road bike stolen, be happy to know that Irvine has been rated the safest city in the United States for ten years in a row! But be smart and still lock your bikes, as there are bike racks all around the med school campus for you to do so. Also, always wear a helmet when you bike! If you are worried about finding time to exercise while in medical school, consider biking to class! It is possible to not have a car, but I would recommend having a backup plan for days when it rains or when you need to wear professional attire (at least once a week). A great backup plan is UCI's bus system, the Anteater Express. It stops at all of the on-campus housing locations, as well as a few off-campus locations around Newport Beach (seasonally) and Irvine. An additional perk of biking to campus is UCI's Sustainability Program. If you live on-campus and bike to class, you can sign up for 50 free all day parking passes, and 50 free night and weekend passes (Students often use these parking passes as their backup plans!). There is a bike shop on campus called \"Bike Religion\" for anyone looking to buy a new bike or accessories, inflate tires, or get repairs done (405 W Peltason, Irvine, CA 92617). Also, if any of you are interested in biking outside of just getting to class, there is a cycling club at UCI for bikers at all levels. Biking to Campus About 15% of the MS1 class take the Anteater Express to get to campus. Up to 30% bike, but occasionally use other forms of transportation Oh, the places you'll go!

MedEd can get a tad claustrophobic at times, so there are some other places you can turn to for studying. One place that many students love is the Newport Public Library. Get yourself a library card, head on up to the 2nd floor, and snag a seat at one of the desks that gives glimpses of the ocean. Super helpful when you're sick of studying but want to remind yourself that you're darn lucky to be in medical school in such a beautiful place. Make sure to check the website for hours because they don't stay open very late on the weekend On-campus options Study Spaces UCI SOM's Medical Education Building (AKA Med Ed) On-campus studiers will get to know these walls really well. The small caf\u00e9 on the patio can fuel those mid -day cravings. Langson Library Situated right across Gateway Study Center. A great way to get some exercise and a good excuse to walk across beautiful Aldrich Park. Francisco J. Ayala Science Library (AKA Sci Li) A nostalgic option for UCI Alumni. There is a room dedicated to graduate students to help filter out the noisy undergraduates. Ask the front desk for details Gateway Study Center When the UCI campus was first born, Gateway was the main cafeteria as pictured to the left . Now a converted study center, the atmosphere inside is much different as you can imagine! Public Libraries Sherman Library and Gardens at Corona Del Mar Newport Beach Public Library A UCI SOM student favorite. Has a fantastic learning environment and outside seating to catch some Vitamin D. A small caf\u00e9 is located inside to keep you going. Irvine University Park Libr ary Irvine Heritage Park Proper caffeination is key to medical school survival. While we can't yet hook up a coffee IV directly into your median cubital vein, the following suggestions will keep you happy and awake through those long days of studying. (See the dining guide for more suggestions/details). Coffee Shops Portola Coffee Lab Prepare your hipster coffee senses and take a deep sip of this epically roasted coffee or espresso with two locations nearby in Costa Mesa and Orange. Alta Coffee Shop This cute little coffee shop on Newport Peninsula offers great coffee, brunch and a hip atmosphere. Protip: Bring your own mug to keep there, they'll wash it for you and give you a discount. Kean Coffee This cute little coffee shop on Newport Peninsula offers great coffee, brunch and a hip atmosphere. Protip: Bring your own mug to keep there, they'll wash it for you and give you a discount. This coffee is the real deal. W ith epic coffee and a chill vibe, sit and catch up with a good book joint. Just know, they don't offer wifi , which can actually be really nice. Starbucks Coffee It wouldn't be a proper coffee shop section if Starbucks isn't in it. Starbuck's coffee shops are everywhere in Irvine. Running up a close second is Pete's coffee. The closest Starbucks from UCI SOM's campus is across the street. By Jessica Lin , Alex Anshus The Anteater Recreation Center , also known as the ARC , is UCI's student recreation facility/gym, and reportedly one of the finest of any university in California. Regardless of how you like to exercise, chances are the ARC has you covered: basketball courts, racquetball courts, weight training rooms, an indoor track, exercise classes, a rock climbing wall, plenty of outdoor facilities (pool, baseball and soccer fields, tennis courts), and much, much more! They coordinate countless recreational classes at the ARC as well, including scuba certification, healthy cooking courses, dance, yoga, martial arts, and more. Don't have the right gear? The ARC has you covered. You can also rent equipment, such as towels, basketballs, footbal ls, and many more. All medical students have access to the ARC, although it's located on the opposite side of campus relative to the medical school (but right across the street from Palo Verde and Verano Place campus hou sing). For full details, visit the ARC website The Anteater Recreation Center The ARC is so state -of-the-art that Los Angeles Laker legend, Kobe Bryant, and San Antonio Spur, Lamarcus Aldridge , used to make occasional appearances (although I have yet to see him there). ARC Tricks of the Trade: If you register with the staff there, you can use fingerprint technology to identify yourself and gain access to the facilities. That way you don't have to carry your student ID with you when you work out. Being such a nice gym that services the e ntire UCI student body, the ARC can get pretty crowded at times. Depending on your anticipated activity, you may want to avoid busy hours. For example, I play a lot of pickup basketball there, but if I show up between 4:30 -7 pm on a weekday, I probably will have to wait a few games before I'm able to play. In case things are too crowded inside, there are plenty of outdoor facilities to take advantage of. Keep yourself sane by f inding something to do regu larly that isn't school related! Tom Keown , Class of 2019 Intramurals at UCI are very similar to most college intramurals, and are tons of fun. There are countless sports/leagues available to choose from, each of which are usually offered one quarter per year. The more popular sports may be broken up into leagues of varying levels of competition, and every league will have a mix of undergraduates and graduate students filling its rosters. Most sports have about a 5 game season, followed by some sort of playoff tournament for teams that qualify. These teams are rea lly what you make out of them: if you are committed and want to put in a lot of time your team can coordinate practices among themselves, and if you're not into that and just want to have some fun, you can just show up once a week for your games. Any team that wins the championship gets a glorious IM championship t -shirt. UCISOM has an impressive track record with IMs, with representation in most leagues and even some championships! So if you're interested at all and want to play with other med students, don't hesitate to ask around and someone will point you in the right direction. We're banking on you to continue our legacy! For more information/details, please visit: campus rec sports. Intramural Sports \"Ok, so I know UCI is already awesome, but as a gym/pool frequent I read through the ARC website and am sold. Besides having everything from classes (even guitar/cooking classes -what?!) to standard gym space, pool, and every sport field possible, Yelp revie ws even show UCLA students who prefer our gym to theirs. Also, Gear Up can give me pool buoys for swimming: take THAT, 24 hr! UCI also has an amazing rock wall. Don't forget about the martial arts mat room...not going to lie that was a selling point for m e. Not a lot of gyms have that. They also occasionally host free clas ses-- usually cooking \" - Robi Bucayu , Class of 2019 Whirl your way around the dance floor or bust a move with new friends.

Sender One Gym Started by arguably the best sport climber in the world, Chris Sharma, this gym is one of the most progressive gyms in the US with wal ls topping out at 60 ft.

Included in this gym are also a full workout area and a yoga s tudio offering variety of classes. The gym offers student discounts and monthly free visitor pass with membership. Outdoor Climbing If you want to head out and climb some real rocks, you're in luck. Many of your future classmates are huge climbing enthusiasts, planning trips to head out almost every weekend. Orange County offers easy access to many famous climbing areas: For sport climbing enthusiasts visit Malibu Creek State Park, Riverside Quarry, Red Rock s, or New Jack City. For trad climbing and bouldering visit the national park at Joshua Tree, Tahquitz, or the TramWay. Exercise, Activities, and Classes Dancing and Dance Classes Rock Climbing If you find yourself getting sick of In 'n Out Burger and Chipotle for dinner every night, blasphemous, I know, then maybe you should try out a cooking class!

I applied for on campus grad housing and ended up at PV. Total Rent : $811 per month Rent Per Person : $811 per person/month Lease Length : 1 year Why Should I want to live here? The application for on campus housing was easier than finding a place off campus. I wasn't able to visit apartments before moving, so I just settled with living on campus. I'm glad I live across the street from the ARC...or I'd probably never work out. Why Should I not want to live here? It is possible to get a roommate you don't like...and it could be a whole year before you can move...so it's a gamble. BUT you get to email your future roommate before signing the lease. I really like PV and my roomma te so I'll be renewing my lease for next year :) Distance from UCI SOM : 1.6 miles Can you bike it?: Definitely Distance from UCIMC : 18 miles Distance from the Closest Beach : 5.1 miles to Corona Del Mar Time you leave for 8:00am class : 7:45 Zip Code : 92617 Pet Friendly : No Grocery Stores nearby : 2 Restaurants nearby: Many; Afters Ice Cream, 85 Degree Bakery, Sunmerry B akery Demographic of the complex : Med students and grad students About how many UCI med students live within a mile of you?: 5+ Amenities: \u00fcPay for laundry \u00fcUnfurnished \u00fcRent includes excludes electricity Palo Verde Graduate Apartments http://housing.uci.edu/housingOptions/Palo_Verde.html 2-3 word description of the vibe of living situation : Across from the ARC Students : Nandie Khahera , Class of 2019 Student Contact Info : akhahera @uci.edu Living Arrangements : 2br, 1.5 ba; My only roommate is a law student whom I was randomly assigned to.

Total Rent : $1,622 per month Rent Per Person : $811 per person/month Lease Length : 1 year Why Should I want to live here? As a medical student, day -to-day convenience can be key. If you ever need to travel back to your apartment between classes or study sessions, it is only a 5 -7min drive. Restaurants and grocery stores are around you and you can walk to friends' apartments who live in Palo Verde. Directly across the street is UCI's gym, the ARC, and it allows me to walk to the gym in the mornings and walk back without issue. There are also plenty of running trails on the streets s urrounding Palo Verde. Perhaps my favorite part is waking up early and watching dogs during their morning walks as I read some physiology. Why Should I not want to live here? If you are burning the midnight oil studying and arrive late at night, you may have to park a bit far from your apartment. This is because parking spots are not assigned so they are on a first - come, first -served basis. There will be parking spots available, but they just may be further away. There is also no elevator in case you nee d to carry heavy things up and down from your apartment. Thankfully the stairs are wide so carrying up couches and tables is not an issue. Regardless of these inconveniences, I emphatically renewed my lease to live there next year.

He is an engineering PhD candidate. Total Rent : $1,200 per month Rent Per Person : $760 per person/month Lease Length : 1 year Why Should I want to live here? I ultimately chose to apply for campus housing because it was more convenient to live closer to school. The housing rates are also pretty competitive as well. There are a lot of classmates who live nearby either in Verano Place or Palo Verde which is right next to us. We are located near the ARC, UTC, restaurants, and grocery stores. You can also save on transportation and parking since you get free parking on- site. You can use the Anteater Express or a bike to get to the med school campus without having to purchase a parking permit for $70/month if you drive. Overall, a convenient, quiet, safe and af fordable option to consider. Why Should I not want to live here? If you are looking to live with other med students, it would be best if you live off -campus since this would be easier to coordinate. On -campus housing would most likely place you with other random grad students who applied for housing as well. Since regul ar MD students are not guaranteed on -campus housing, you would need to apply ASAP after March 1st because it is competitive to receive an on -campus housing offer. Don't expect to hear back until June or July. While you wait, it would be good to have altern atives in case you don't receive an on-campus housing offer. Additionally, if you are not drawn to what Irvine has to offer and want something more exciting and closer to the water, live in Newport. Living on -campus will remind you that you are in a colle ge town, surrounded by undergrads.

Baypointe is a gre at place to live if you want to escape medical school and live in a community of young professionals (and avoid the feel of a campus dorm). It is located right near the back bay trail which is a great running/biking loop around the bay. The community hosts some fun events every month and the housing office is extremely accommodating and prompt. It is a gated apartment complex that closes the gates every evening from 6:30 pm to 8 am. We never hear our neighbors and it feels like we have a town home because w e have a one -car garage which is great for storage! We are right near the 73 freeway which provides easy access to the medical center. Why Should I not want to live here? You do not want to live here if you want to pretend you are in college again. You also don't want to live here if you are a heartless person who hates dogs. I am planning on living here for all four years of medical school because it is such an awesome place.

Total Rent : $2,695 per month Rent Per Person : $920-1100 per person/month Lease Length : 1 year Why Should I want to live here? Newport North is a great place to live. My roommates and I chose it because of its proximity to campus and its quality. Amenities and the buildings in the Newport North complex are new and high quality. Coordination with the housing office was easy and we got settled in no time. One of the biggest reasons why we chose Newport North was also its supply of parking spaces and gues t parking. My roommates and I brought our cars with us and finding parking inside the complex is safe, easy, and always plentiful if friends and family visit. Why Should I no t want to live here? You should not live in Newport North if you are looking to party or make a lot of loud noise. The majority of people who live in the complex are young families with very young children who may have early bed times. Also, I haven't expe rienced this myself because our lease hasn't ended yet, but rumor has it that Newport North is notorious for dipping into your security deposit at the end of the year for very minute details.

Villa Siena is a great place to live if you want to escap e campus and live in a community of young professionals. They don't allow co-signers so this pretty much disqualifies most of the undergraduate students from living here so my building is fairly quiet. Like a few other properties on here, the community is managed by The Irvine Company and they host fun events every month. The housing office is incredibly helpful and whenever I put in a repair request online, they either come the day of or the following day. It is a gated complex w ith a security guard, so you always feel safe. Parking is a breeze (we each have our own spots right next to the elevator in an underground parking garage and there is plenty of guest parking . We rarely hear our neighbors and the complex is right off of th e 405 jamboree exit so that gives you easy access to the medical center. If you leave your house 15 minutes before lecture, you will arrive on time. I highly recommend this apartment complex! Why Should I not want to live here? If you want to party ever y night and be loud. This is a fairly quiet apartment complex and that will not go well with your neighbors. Otherwise, I really have no complaints!

Total Rent : $3,800 per month Rent Per Person : $950 per person/month Lease Length : 1 year Why Should I want to live here? I chose this complex because of the proximity to the beach, the peninsula, and the many beach towns up and down PCH. The Newport/Costa Mesa area is very vibrant and there is always something fun to do here. It's easy to stay active with the many hiking/biking trails up and down the coast, and the beach is a great place to relax after a long week. Plus we're only 15 minutes away from campus, so getting to school is never an issue. I'll be living here again next year. Why Should I not want to live here? Someone who feels that they need to attend every lecture or be at school every day may want to live closer to campus. Distance from UCI SOM : 7 miles Can you bike it?: Yes, but difficult.

If you're stuck on something or aren't sure where to go next, having roommates to help you out is great. Also - if you forget about some mandatory event, usually your roo mmates will remind you (or wake you up) before it's too late. Living where you find yourself most comfortable is also a good idea. Since most classes aren't mandatory, you can live a little further away from campus if you think you'll be happier there.

Total Rent : $1,85 0 per month Rent Per Person : $925 per person/month Lease Length : 1 year Why Should I want to live here? For some people, being constantly surrounded by medical students, medical school, etc can be overwhelming. Living here has been a great respite from everything, and it's good to remember the outside world when you're studying most of your waking hours! There's also a shopping center a few minutes walk down the road that has everything you could want: a large grocery s tore, about a dozen restaurants spanning every food style, Chase/BoA banks, a mens hair salon, even a mail office and massage parlor (obviously very expensive). The entire neighborhood is also very quiet. I'm only one highway stop away from campus; it take s me about 15 -25 minutes depending on traffic. Why Should I not want to live here? This housing complex is difficult for me to recommend solely because of the price. When utilities are included it's about 1050 a month for both of us. Additionally, we got a unit on the 3rd floor but because the community is composed of about a hundred separate buildings, there are no elevators in any of them. That has made taking our dogs out a few times a day a real hassle. If you want to always be around where med studen ts are hanging out, have easy access to on -campus studying (if you prefer not to study at home --I do), etc, then I wouldn't recommend this place. We are going to be moving to a place next year that is on the ground floor and has hardwood floors!

My roommates and I loved this location because of its location and pricing. Although we are about 12 minutes from campus, we are conveniently surrounded by many restaurants and grocery stores; for us it is nice to have a place to retreat away to from the busy campus area. Parking is never an issue here and coordination with our landlord is easy! Our neighborhood is quiet, making it a great place to study or relax. Why Should I not want to live here?

This area is nice and affordable because we found a good deal through our friend. It's very quiet and safe in this neck of the woods and it's nice to be by the water. We can take the ferry to the other side which leads to the beach and many restaurants. It 's a bigger space with a big kitchen and living room space which is nice. Why Should I not want to live here? It is a bit of a drive away from school. It takes about ~15 - 20 minutes with normal traffic so you kind've have to plan your day without being able to go home right after classes.

Our neighborhood (and others in North Orange County) is perfect for someone who needs to or wants to be between Irvine and LA (significant other, family, etc.). Our neighborhood is very safe, and we have a backyard, which is perfect for our dog. We are walking distance from downtown Brea, which is a fun area with restaurants, bars, and a movie theater. We are also close to downtown Fullerton, another fun ar ea which has a college- town feel (close to CSUF). It may be far from Irvine, but it's a great way to get separation from school and come home to something a bit different. Why Should I not want to live here? Mine is a unique living situation, and first years would most likely not want to live here because of the distance from school. It typically takes 45 minutes to an hour to get to school for an 8am or 9am class, and leaving any time after 3:30pm to come home takes about the same amount of time.

A: Usually on -campus housing is not offered a spot until mid -July. Contacting the hous ing office at your target community periodically (though not so much as to be annoying, it's a fine line) can be helpful. It is recommended to have a temporary place to live in case it takes that long to get off the waitlist. Respond promptly to the emails and be specific in your communications with the housing office. For those that have leases that start a few weeks after school starts, you may be able to request an earlier move-in date through the housing office. Be willing to move in during July and try to be as specific if possible! Q: To the techy people out there, what Internet speed do 3 MS1 roommates need? A: 10 Mbps would be liveable, +25 Mbps would be good, 100 Mbps would be more than enough. ProTip s SETTING UP ELECTRICITY: gas and electric companies have special rates for low income households (like students accumulating massive amounts of debt) through the CARE program . All you have to do is fill out your information online and state your household income, and you save 20- 30% your bills if you qualify. Here are the links I used: SoCal Gas CARE program OUT OF STATE STUDENTS BECOMING CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS You may have heard that UCI allows you to become a resident and pay in -state tuition after the first year. This is true, but there are some steps that you need to take and document throughout the year to build a strong petition for residency reclassificati on. The application and to -do list may be found on the registrar's website. Try to knock out as many items as you can before school starts and make sure you keep those things in mind as the year progresses. You want everything done as early as possible because it strengthens your case, so definitely don't let months go by. Examples would be registering to vote and voting in California, registering your car here, getting a California drive r's license etc. WARNING: Anteaters are as ferocious as they are obscure. Section 4: Student Life Are you wondering about... \u00fcIntramural Sports \u00fcStudent Groups & Organizations \u00fcFree Clinics at UCISOM \u00fcUCISOM Traditions Resources You've come place! Megan Bernstein Luke Yu Olivia Kaminsky Nam Thai Elisa Zhang Orli Florsheim Katrina Lee William Minteer Monica Lee Lauren Shreve Soe Thein Michael Butler Contributing Authors Contributing Authors Orientation Wake up in the morning feelin' like....an official medical student. Contributors: Luke Yu, Olivia Kaminsky, Nam Thai Welco me to Orientation, a jam -packed, 3 -days for your official initiation to becoming a true part of the UCI School of Medicine. In just a few days you will: Interact with new peers that will soon become family. Meet with and listen to welcome statements by the deans and administration in their respective fields . Receive your iPads which will accompany you on a daily basi s through our academic careers . Find your Academic Society groups along with your Academic Society Leader. These groups will quickly become your support system, led by a physician in the UCI health care system that will take you under their wings to help you navig ate through the medical journey. Tour the medical center where you soon discover and nurture your specific passions in medicine Get the chance to express your creativity through medical skits - one of the most memorable events of the entire week! The skits may have been awkward at first, since it was really the first time during orientation that we got to meet and interact with our future classmates. However, it ended being so fun to work together and then perform the skits in front of everyone. Many upperclassmen have told me to take advantage of social events during my first year since time will be very limited as we approach 2nd and 3rd year. It is great to take breaks and go bond with your classmates. The opportunities to do this later will only diminish. Eva Martinez, Class of 2019 You will quickly realize the warmth and nurturing community here at UCI. The upper classmen, administration and faculty at UCI are very friendly , accessible, and available\u2014something that will continue all throughout your years as a medical student. Whether it be answering questions about the lifestyle of a medical student or providing opportunities to shadow, it truly felt like the medical school journey would be a team effort. The days will feel incredibly busy, yet in the most exciting way. The MS 2 students will organized daily evening social mixers at some of the local favorites\u2014 a perfect time to get to know our classmates in a more casual environment! And as a culmination of all of these events? The White Coat Ceremony. You will be photographed in the white coat you so longingly wished to hold on to when you were fitted into it during your interview days. However, this time, they will be personally embroidered, a symbol of your readiness to begin the path as a medical student. There will be a few hours to enjoy our families and friends prior to the official ceremony. The time before White Coat are a bit hectic as you may tr y to coordinate with travelling family for the ceremony. Plan early for any family activities before the actual ceremony, most of us opted for a late lunch/early dinner just to be safe. Orientation is such an exciting time! Even if you don't remember everyone's names, meet as many people as you can. Orientation is truly an unforgettable experience. Meet your classmates because you'll find that there are so many awesome people in the class. It's nice to have a support system to help you with the stress and the fun of being in medical school. Luke Yu, Class of 2019 Being in a new state, city, and school can be difficult. Away from your usual support system, starting from zero, negative numbers in debt, and surrounded by strangers can be an uneasy transition. Fear not! We have all been outsiders to the anteater family before. Below are a few tricks of the trade from various students of the UCI SOM community. Be yourself. Don't let anyone take who you are away from you. Medical school can be brutal b ut if you don't fit the mold, you can find your place and achieve amazing things, whether that means studying as hard as you can or spending your time on efforts outside medical school that are deeply meaningful to you. Kyle Barbour, Class of 2018 Balance self- care and academic goals. Shella Raja, Class of 2019 Finding balance is important. I was told to not worry too much about exams and focus m ore on learning as much as I can while having fun and maintaining a social life. Katy Lunny, Class of 2019 I think the best advice I got was to have fun a nd not stress too much about school. It's all about finding a balance and continuing to do things outside of med school that you love. Alex Anshus, Class of 2019 - First year is as fun and/or as stressful as you make it. You have more free time than one would expect and it us up to you to fill it up with things that make you happy. Also, comparing yourself to others is not required as there are many different paths to the same specialties. We are all examp les of this as we enter medical school: no two applicants are exactly alike, and yet we are all part of the same class. Nandie Khahera, Class of 2019 Study hard and sleep. David Avila, Class of 2019 Don't take things so seriously. This is a good time to explore and try new things. Dhruba Banerjee, Clas s of 2019 - First year is all about learning how to learn best. Work hard but also remember to take time for your own wellbeing. Set aside time every day to do something that you love! Katrina Lee, Class of 2019 - Don't forget to do the things that make you, you! If you like yoga, take a new class. Want to stay active in you r global health interests? Find a summer ultrasound trip! Need to organize all your notes by color? YOU DO YOU. Being a medical student isn't about being someone new, it s about doing it in a way that keeps you excited every day! Megan Bernstein, Class of 2019 Don't take everything so seriously! Monica Lee, Class of 2019 Free Clinic Volunteer Opportunities at UCISOM Contributors: Elisa Zhang, Orli Florsheim, Megan Bernstein, Katrina Lee, William Minteer, Monica Lee It can be very easy to forget that many parts of Orange County are not as prosperous as Irvine. Santa Ana, just 15 minutes away from campus, has the 5th -highest rate of uninsured individuals in the US (21.2%) according to the 2011 American Community Survey. Furthermore, 23.5% live below the poverty line and 77.1% have less than a high school education. The nearby cities of Anaheim, Garden Grove, Westminster and Orange have high rates of uninsured individuals (17 -20%), in contrast with Irvine and Newport Beach (6 -9%). Because of this immense need, UCI SOM students lead and volunteer at four amazing free clinics that serve uninsured patients in the a forementioned cities , as well as Mexico. Most of these free clinics run weekly (every Saturday), so we can always, ALWAYS use more medical student volunteers to see patients (especially on Saturdays before exams) . Pro Tip : Be sure to attend the first Social Medicine Elective lecture held in August, where each of the free clinics will give a presentation about their work. Besides helping out our less fortunate neighbors, why else should you volunteer? Reinforce what you're learning in class. Nothing helps you remember the clinical presentation of a disease or the complications arising from it than treating a real, breathing, scared patient wi th the disease. Many fellow classmates and I never regret spending a morning at clinic because we always feel like we learn some high -yield clinical pearls. It is uncanny (but very reassuring and exciting) that every time you volunteer, you will be able to connect something you see in clinic to something you learned about in your basic science lectures. Learn the practical aspects of treating or diagnosing a disease . Sure, in physiology class you memorized that type 2 diabetes is defined by HbA1c > 6.5%. But what kind of doctor-y things are you actually supposed to do when a patient comes to you for diabetes follow -up? One-on-one mentorship from physicians helping you through the entire patient encounter . What better way is there to prepare for the wards as an MS3, where this kind of individualized mentorship will be rare ? Becoming comfortable and competent in the clinic early on will very likely boost the evaluations you receive as a clinical student and sharpen your resume when applying to residency. Practice clinical skills on real patients, rather than on standardized patients (i.e. actors). Clinical Foundations is an essential part of our curriculum, but taking the history, performing a physical exam, and generating a differential diagnosis is much harder (and more interesting!) when you get the quirks and curveballs that come with real patients. To recharge and remember why you are in medical school. There are a million reasons why medical school can be stressful; the barrage of tests that first year throws at you is a common one. It can be very easy to become overly stressed by these tests and lose sight of why we decided to become a doctor. Seeing patients in the clinic is a great way to regain perspective on the big picture of medical training and remember why most of us decided to become doctors in the first place \u2014to help people. On average, MS1s who volunteer at free clinics commit about 5 hours per month. Interclinic Counsel Although all four free clinics operate independently of each other, the Interclinic Council was established this last year (2015) as a forum to better address common issues faced by all these clinics in serving the underserved population in Orange County a nd Valle Redondo, Mexico. The main goal of this council is to increase communication between clinics and better share resources (such as health education programs, social service resources, and pamphlets) that all our patients can benefit from and strategi es for problems commonly encountered in clinic. One to two representatives from each clinic meet monthly in this council. Please contact Priya Patel (priyaap1@uci.edu) for more information. Website: http://interclinicuci.weebly.com/ Orange County Needle E xchange Program (OCNEP) In February 2016, a group of UCI medical students succeeded in opening not only the first needle exchange in Orange County, but also the first in the country to be run by medical students. It provides clean needles, dirty needle disposal, HIV and Hep C screening, referrals to health, housing, and treatment services, and other harm reduction and safer -sex supplies and information. This unique volunteer experience at UCI immerses medical students in harm reduction training, which includes learning how to administer naloxone, and enables volunteers to work alongside incredible community members and organizations that directly save liv es on a daily basis. In order to volunteer OCNEP, you will attend one of our training sessions on campus, and shadow us out in the community. We are completely staffed by volunteers, and we are counting on medical student volunteers to help us continue t o thrive as an organization offering indispensible services to the community.

Current www.ocnep.org Crescent Clinic Crescent Clinic first opened its doors in April 2014 after its founder, Tipu Khan, MD and several UCI medical students and undergraduates spent several years conducting a health needs assessment of the community. Crescent Clinic had been previously functioning as a mobile health clinic that travelled around Orange County under the name of Shifa Clinic. South Garden Grove was identified as the most underserved population in the area without a free clinic. Medical students and a large undergraduate base now staff the clinic every week, while supplies and a dedicated clinic space is sponsored by the Islamic Ci rcle of North America . The most unique aspect of the Crescent clinic is the wide ethnic patient diversity (South Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Filipino, African-American, Caucasian) This can prove to be an invaluable experience as you gain exposure to r eligious customs and cultural preferences that you may have never experienced before.

As a satellite of Lestonnac Free Clinic, we strive to provide he althcare at a minimal to no cost to all uninsured individuals within Orange County and Southern California, while expanding and building upon the resources available to foster a healthy and sound communities. Currently, we provide primary care, preventive services, referrals, and health education to uninsured adults. \"An l\u00e0nh\" means peace or healing in Vietnamese. Our clinic is unique because it has been a collaborative effort between UCI medical and undergraduate students since inception. Both medical and undergraduate students hold positions on the executive board and play vital roles in the clinic's operations. The majority of the patients that we serve come from either Latino or Vietnamese backgrounds. We are always looking for physicians, medical students, and other health professional students to volunteer and contribute to our clinic.

Really only have to pass. Alyssa Lo , Class of 2019 Don't get involved too quickly - you don't want to take on too many roles and become overwhelmed at the beginning of med school. It's better to figure out how m uch time you need for studying, then add on things that you can manage. - Alex Anshus , Class of 2019 1. Heads up, you're going to feel like a kid in a candy store! Being involved in so many different things is a lot of fun. Since our class of ~100 is relatively small, it is a fun way to ge t to know your classmates and become immersed in the Anteater community. Being involved has also taught me lessons that can't be found inside the classroom like leadership, communication, and accountability. Bima Hasjim, Class of 2019 Be efficient wit h your time. (i.e. don't waste it), study hard, eat well and exercise often. Kevin Labadie , Class of 2016 AMSG Co -President Matched at University of Washington General Surgery Here's the best advice I have: If you learn how to manage your time properly, you have nothing to worry about. You won't be stressed or overwhelmed, and you'll have time to enjoy what you're learning and enjoy extra- curriculars. - Kevin Ro y, Class of 2019 For those who may be prone to being over involved - hold off on joining too many activities right away because it can get overwhelming. Olivia Kaminsk y, Class of 2019 Count your hours. Treat med school like a job, and if you do quality work between breakfast and dinner you definitely can and should take the time to relax and be a normal human again every day.

There are countless sports/leagues available to choose from, each of which are usually offered one quarter per year. The more popular sports may be broken up into leagues of varying levels of competition, and every league will have a mix of undergraduates and graduate students filling its rosters. Most sports have about a 5 game season, followed by some sort of playoff tournament for teams that qualify. These teams are really what you make out of them: if you are committed and want to put in a lot of time your team can coordinate practices among themselves, and if you're not into that and just want to have some fun, you can just show up once a week for your games. Any team that wins the championship gets a glorious IM championship t-shirt. UCISOM has an impressive track record with IMs, with representation in most leagues and even some championships! So if you're interested at all and want to play with other med students, don't hesitate to ask around and someone will point you in the right direction. We're banking on you to continue our legacy!

Wiechmann Associate Dean of Educational Technology Dr. Julie Youm Instructional Technologies Acknowledgements: Jeffrey Suchard, M.D. \u0001 Associate Dean, Basic Science Education Hello! My name is Jeff Suchard, and I am the Associate Dean for Basic Science Education here at UC Irvi ne Health School of Medicine. Today I want to give you a glimpse into your first year of medical school at UC Irvine. We are working hard to ensure that the pre -clerkship curriculum is clinically relevant and prepares our students well for their future careers. Starting in the 2015 -16 academic year, the UC Irvine Health School of Medicine will be following our novel iTEACH curriculum. iTEACH is an acronym that stands for: Integrated, Technology- Enhanced, Activity -Coordinated, and Humanistic, helping the school to focus its educational vision. In addition, iTEACH is a declarative statement (i.e., \"I teach\") from the faculty regarding their role in the process. \u0001The overarching goals of the iTEACH curriculum are: 1. To teach content in an integrated fashion within educational blocks which limit the number of concurrent courses and standardizes examination systems. 2. To provide a technology -enhanced learning environment, capitalizing on UC Irvine's national expertise in digital -based education, ultrasound, and simulation. 3. To give students an activity -coordinated curriculum that emphasizes early clinical training through the use of advanced instructional technologies and a patient- centered pre- clinical clerkship. 4. To develop physicians with life -long humanistic values by emphasizing the art of medicine, medical humanities, compassionate patient care, effective communication, and diversity awareness. In the 2015 -16 year, orientation for first -year students will begin in early August. The first block is \"Nor mal Human Structure & Function,\" which includes Anatomy & Embryology, Histology, and Physiology. We believe it's important to get students into the Anatomy lab as soon as feasible, to start the training that is clearly and directly clinically- oriented. The Anatomy component carries over into the \"Mind & Brain\" block, since Anatomy of the Head and Neck regions correlate well with Neuroscience, Behavioral Science and Medical Ethics. The final basic science block of the first year is \"Molecular Basis of Medici ne,\" which combines instruction in Biochemistry with Human Genetics and introduces concepts key to understanding neoplasia (cancer biology), preparing students for their introduction to Pathology at the beginning of the following year. \u0001 Throughout the first year, students also take the Clinical Foundations I course, which rounds out your medical education with instruction in obtaining a patient's history, performing physical examination, medical documentation, inter -professional teamwork, and the fundamentals of epidemiology and biostatistics. Students also train frequently in simulation, both with standardized patients and in our high -fidelity Simulation Laboratory. UC Irvine is also known for its longitudinal Clinical Ultrasound curr iculum that occurs throughout all four years of medical school. Our new Patient -Centered clinical clerkship (PACE) begins toward the end of the MS1 year, and continues through the MS2 year. In the PACE program, students get weekly, clinical instruction fro m their primary care physician mentors, patients, and clinical practices. PACE provides an opportunity to see real medicine in action and to hone clinical skills, during a time traditionally dedicated only to classroom instruction. Over the summer, between the MS1 and MS2 years, students have time off to pursue research or other dedicated extracurricular activities. \u0001 I hope this gives you a quick overview of your first year. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at jsuchard@uci.edu . Interactive Learning Julie Youm, PhD Division of Educational Technology A large effort has been undertaken to improve the active learning experiences in the medical school curriculum. Two ways in which this has been approached is through greater flipped classroom and small -group learning experiences. To support the flipped classroom, the School of Medicine opened a media studio in the Medical Education Building where faculty and students can come to recor d high -quality video podcasts. There have also be en efforts for more faculty/ student -generated content such as iBooks , multi -touch, interactive digital textbooks . Reviewing didactic content ahead of time via podcasts and iBooks allows in- person class time to be used for presentation of clinical cases, simulations, interactive discussions , and small -group activities. Physiology, Genetics, Biochemistry , Histology and Neuroscience are examples of courses that have integrated flippe d classroom and/or small -group active learning opportunities using various modalities to improve student engagement. \"I have found the flipped classroom and small group sessions to be a particularly valuable portion of the UCI Curriculum. It is quite refreshing to break the typical mold of didactic lecture and have real discussions on cases and questions with my peers. I often find my strengths and weaknesses during these sessions, which has proven invaluable while studying for exams on a time bu dget. I'm incredibly grateful that we have people behind the scenes organizing these efforts!\" -Adam Kalawi MS2 Ultrasound in Medical Education Chris Fox, MD Assistant Dean, Student Affairs Director of Instructional Ultrasound With the advent of battery -powered, hand -held ultrasound machines, medical students can peer through the skin at internal organs to see abnormalities without exposing patients to radiation. Our mission is to provide medical students with bedside ultrasound skills at the point of care by integrating these skills throughout their medical school training. Ultrasound in Medical Education has the potential not only to enhance the learning experience for students, but also to improve the quality of patient care provided. The Clinical Foundations of Ultrasound is the first stage of a four -year integration of the Ultrasound in Medical Educ ation curriculum. By learning the physics and optimization of ultrasound image acquisition, it serves as an introduction to live ultrasound anatomy and physiology. This helps students connect what they learn in basic science courses, anatomy laboratory, an d basic clinical foundations and provides additional opportunities to practice patient -physician communication and draping techniques. This is achieved through participation in a series of hands -on sessions led by senior medical students, residents, fellow s, and faculty. Students are evaluated periodically throughout the year including on the OSCE exam. There is a robust ultrasound elective during the preclinical years for students who want to learn even more! In the third year, clerkship -focused training prepares students at the patients' bedside through the support of dedicated faculty in the respective departments. All educational scans conducted by students are recorded as video -clips, and reviewed with the students. By the time students are in their f ourth year, there is a dedicated emergency ultrasound four- week elective. Students perfect image acquisition and interpretation throughout large range of applications in the emergency department. Fourth year students can sign up for a month long ultrasound elective that is in the specialty of their choice. In this clerkship, students focus on the various procedures and techniques specific to their specialty. All educational scans conducted by students are recorded as live images, stored in a central syste m, and reviewed with the students by Dr. J. Christian Fox, Director of Instructional Ultrasound in Medical Education. By the end of medical school , students have over 50 hours of hands -on experience with ultrasound and demonstrate proficiency on over 10 applications of point -of-care ultrasound. International Ultrasound Initiative Allison Zha , Bradley Jacobsen, Anjali Hari MS4's Congrats and welcome to UCI! During the summer between first and second year, you will have time off as dedicated vacation time. Students engage in a variety of activities during this time, from research to volunteering to travel. One of the strengths of UCI is our summer international ultrasound initiative. Eve ry summer, about 40% of the first year medical school class travel all over the world to teach ultrasound to medical students and physicians, participate in ultrasound-related research, and to learn about healthcare and medicine in other countries. We have had teams travel to every continent (except Antarctica), including Panama, Brazil, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Vietnam, India and Australia. While some of these trips have been going on for several years, we also have new projects being established every year. Teams of 3-10 students particip ate in these projects, which last from 4-8 weeks. These projects are student-led, which means you will have the flexibility to design your own curriculum and research project. But don't worry, UCI will provide you with the resources for a successful trip, from ultrasound training sessions that start your first month of med ical school, to lending you portable ultrasound machines to take abroad. You will be able to hear more about these projects at the club fair during the first couple weeks of medical school, with more info sessions throughout the F all. Most teams are formed by January, after which students start preparing for their summers by creating their ultrasound curriculum and drafting their IRBs and research proposals. Additionally, students fundraise for their trips through grants and online fundraising platforms, and spend the last few months preparing to leave the country (i.e. by applying for visa s and receiving immunizations). If you talk to anyone who has gone on an ultrasound summer trip, chances are they will have nothing but positive things to say about it. These trips allow students to explore unique research projects, share their ultrasound knowledge, and gain invaluable insight into cultures different from their own. Get ready to have the time of your life! Panama Tanzania Australia Brazil Turkey Vietnam Research in medical school has become an incredibly important aspect of the education process and a centerpiece in strong residency applications.

Contact Lauren Shreve (lshreve@uci.edu) for more information. Summer Research Funding Research Presentations Research at UC -Irvine School of Medicine Information Irvine offers several great dual degree program options. The MBA, MS-BATS, and MPH programs are all one year in duration, and are traditionally taken between the third and fourth clinical years. Most programs generally offer 10 guaranteed spots for MD students, however, they have accepted more in the past based on numbers of interested and exceptional candidates. http://www.som.uci.edu/graduate- studies/education/dual-degree.asp Applying The application for each of these programs typically occurs at the end of the second year of medical school. However, some programs do allow for applications during the third year. Students considering applying to any program must be in good standing and approved by the medical school. The application consists of a CV, 2-3 letters of recommendation (either from pre-medical school or medical school), personal statement, and an interview. No additional standardized testing (i.e. GRE), are required to apply to these programs. Please see the website of the program below for specific and updated application requirements. Master's of Science in Biomedical and Translational Science (MD/MS -BATS) MS-BATS is a clinical research training program offering a one-year accelerated interdisciplinary clinical research education aimed at developing the skills to conduct, interpret, evaluate and apply clinical research. The curriculum aims to develop a comprehensive training to turn basic and clinical research into improved patient care. Courses include training in statistics, health policy and politics, clinical epidemiology, instruction on health and healthcare, clinical trial analysis and design, grant writing, and many others. The flexibility of the current curriculum design and faculty mentorship encourages students with various clinical interests to enhance their training through electives and specific research focused towards their future chosen specialty. Students will complete and defend a master's thesis at the end of the program. http://www.som.uci.edu/bats/ http://som.uci.edu/graduate-studies//Degree%20Programs/ms-bats-program.asp Dual Degrees at Irvine (5-6 Year Programs) Master's of Business Administration (MD/MBA) UCI's MD/MBA program began in 1998, making it one of the oldest MD/MBA programs in the US. This program is geared toward students who seek a career as physicians with major responsibility in administration and management of healthcare organizations and institutions. Course requirements include 11 core business classes such as finance, statistics, marketing, economics and accounting. About half of the curriculum is student chosen elective courses, with multiple medically related subjects available each term. The business school class size is 100 students per year, with an emphasis on team building and group work by splitting the students into smaller sections for each class. The Paul Merage School of Business in currently rated number 53 in the country, and did we mention Paul Merage is the founder of the Hot Pocket? Nomz. http://www.meded.uci.edu/mdmba/ Master's of Public Health (MD/MPH) UCI's MD/MPH program was started in 2013 and aims to train physicians on the changing public health needs of the world. The five-year dual degree program is aimed at high-achieving and motivated students who are interested in improving the health of individuals and addressing issues that affect the public's health. Curriculum includes courses in the subjects of environmental health, epidemiology, as well as sociocultural diversity and health. Students will complete and defend a master's thesis at the end of the program. http://www.meded.uci.edu/mdmph/ Program in Medical Education for the Latino Community (PRIME -LC) A crucial mission of the UCI School of Medicine is to educate highly qualified physicians to serve the diverse populations of California. This five-year dual-degree program responds to an increasing demand for physician-leaders who are culturally sensitive and linguistically competent to address the specific needs of California's Latinos. PRIME-LC students can elect to pursue any master's degree they feel will aid them in becoming a physician-leader for the Latino community. Students may choose to complete a masters program at UCI or elsewhere, provided acceptance. Students typically pursue their master's degree between their 3rd and 4th years of medical school. PRIME-LC students come from diverse backgrounds but all demonstrate a commitment to service and solid conversational Spanish. The PRIME-LC supplemental application is part of the UCI School of Medicine secondary application and applicants selected for interviews are required to complete a third interview in Spanish. http://www.meded.uci.edu/primelc/ Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) (MD/Ph.D.) Applications and acceptance into the MSTP program occurs concurrently with MD application through the AMCAS application system, except with special circumstances. Students admitted to the MSTP program will take a minimum of seven years to complete the requirements for the two degrees. Medical scientist students generally complete two years of the medical school curriculum, and then enter their Ph.D. research years. Each Ph.D. curriculum is specifically designed for the individual student following guidelines agreed upon by the participating academic units. All medical scientist students will receive on-going curricular guidance from the Program Director. To return to the clinical years (years three and four) a student must have completed all of the requirements for the Ph.D. degree, including preparation and defense of the thesis. http://mstp.uci.edu/ UCI Medical Students can enroll in dual graduate degrees outside of the UCI system. Application deadlines and requirements vary based on the desired program and location. Typically, an additional standardized test will be required, and all masters programs are typically two years in length. Contact Nadia Zuabi (nzuabi@uci.edu), (akhahera@uci.edu) for more information. Dual Degrees Away (5-6 Year Programs) Dual Degrees at Irvine (7+ Year Programs) Academic Advice Adjusting to a new city is even more difficult when you also have to adjust to a new curri culum, pace, and load. Below is some advice to getting you off the ground academically! Focus on learning the important concepts and the big picture. Borna Dabiri , Class of 2016 How to approach anatomy - study ahead! Nathan Calixto , Class of 2019 Use high yield resources outside of the school's curriculum. Adam Kalawi , Class of 2018 Even if you prefer to study alone make time to do some group studying. You'll do better on your tests and it's therapeutic to socialize a little during stressf ul test blocks. Nadia Zuabi , Class of 2019 Relax and don't take school too seriously to the point that you drive yourself insane. It is only first year! Learn to have a balanced schedule! Nam Thai , Class of 2019 Balance academics by doing things that you love continuously throughout the school year Olivia Kaminski , Class of 2019 Study to retain long term and forget about individual test scores. Enjoy first year and get out and meet people. Ashton Christian , Class of 2017 Always try your best. Average in medical school is way above average in the real world. Reach out to loved ones when you have a rough day. Christine Panganiban , Class of 2016 Remember that life keeps going! Don't get too bogged down in studying. Britanny Winckler , Class of 2016 Pass. Just pass. Pass, pass, and pass. Not everyone in medical school is going to be a top - of-the-class scorer, and that's perfectly fine. What matters is you do well on your rotations, and that you score well on your USMLE Step 1 exams. Those are both entirely different skillsets from passing your classes. John Jiao , Class of 2019 Figure out how to study, the first few months is all about learning how you learn best ! Jon Lee , Class of 2019 Don't sweat the academics so much because you'll have more relevant chances to shine in the upcoming years. Brianna Williams , Class of 2019 Section 6: Clinical Exposure Dr. J. Suchard Associate Dean of Basic Sciences Dr. W. Wiechmann Associate Dean of Clinical Sciences Dr. C. Ricks Director of Clinical Simulation Center Clinical Foundations (CF) is a longitudinal clinical medicine course that spans all four years of medical school. Through this course, medical students learn the fundamental clinical skills necessary to communicate with patients, colleagues, and healthcare professionals. Clinical faculty members at UCI School of Medicine serve as mentors throughout the entire process, and consistently provide individual feedback to improve the learning experience. Students are placed in small groups (approximately 3-4 students) led by a UCI physician, and typically meet once every week or two in the Clinical Skills Center. Additionally, students can expect to have periodic ultrasound training sessions, large group discussions on important health topics, and realistic simulations through the inter-professional team critical incident training (ITCI) program. ITCI encourages medical students and nursing students to learn how to effectively work as a team through the use of simulation technology. First year medical students can expect to learn how to conduct a comprehensive medical interview, perform a physical examination, and document clinical encounters. Students are evaluated on their ability to follow the course objectives through an Observed Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE). During this exam, students demonstrate their ability to obtain a complete medical history and perform organ-specific physical examinations. At the beginning of the year, there is a 3- day clinical immersion program where students are assigned to shadow a team of physicians and medical students in the hospital. Specialties include Internal Medicine, Surgery, OB/GYN, Oncology, Neurology, and many more. A pre-clinical clerkship called \"PACE\" (PAtient CEntered) starts in the last 10 weeks of the school year. This program is designed to give students a taste of the clinical clerkships that begin in the third year. Students will spend each Wednesday with an assigned faculty mentor (ideally in primary care) to gain clinical exposure and to hone their clinical exam skills. Furthermore, this program allows students to spend quality time at a physician's practice and gain a deeper understanding of that specialty. For more information, visit this webpage. Clinical Foundations First Year Second year medical students can expect to expand on the skills gained in the previous year through additional didactic lectures and small group interactions . Students build upon their history -taking skills and l earn clinical reasoning to develop potential diagnoses. Further more, students are expected to have a deeper understanding of pathology and pharmacology in their medical encounters. Students will also continue to evaluate their progress through periodical OSCEs. PACE (PAtient CE ntered) will continue as PACE II for th e first 20 weeks of the school year. Students will continue to spend every Wednesday learning from their same mentor from PACE I during this time. For more information, visit this webpage Third year students will spend 2 weeks solidifying the skills learned in CF I and CF II before embarking on the third year clerkships. Students will need to demonstrate the ability to perform a full history and physical examination, draw differential diagnoses, perform a full write-up and SOAP note, perform basic clinical skills (e.g. suturing), interpret radiologic and laboratory results, and communicate effectively with patients and colleagues. Throughout the year, students will continue to evaluate their progress through clerkship-specific OSCEs (surgery, OB/GYN, Pediatrics, Family Medicine, and Neuroscience). Additionally, UCI will be incorporating \"inter-sessions\" into the school year. These sessions will allow students to meet back together as a class to learn hot topics pertaining to the clinical clerkships and to discuss the social aspects of medicine (e.g. healthcare policy, business of medicine, cultural issues, etc.). For more information, visit this webpage Second Year Third Year Fourth year students can expect to prepare for life as a physician by working with colleagues and allied healthcare professionals in on-call scenarios. At the beginning of the year, fourth year medical students take a Clinical Practice Exam (CPX) to assess their communication, history taking skills, and physical examination skills. The Clinical Skills Center (CSC) is the primary location of clinical education at UCI School of Medicine. It is located on the second floor of the Medical Education (MedEd) Building, and includes 17 patient rooms and three acute-care simulation rooms. This one-of-a-kind facility is where students interact with clinical instructors and standardized patients to gain valuable skills in a clinical s etting. Students complete the objectives of the Clinical Foundations course by learning how to take a medical history, perform physical exams, and learn bedside ultrasound techniques. All clinical encounters are recorded, and students are able to evaluate their performance with faculty. To learn more about the Clinical Skills Center, please visit this website Fourth Year Clinical Skills Center Cameron Ricks, MD Director, Medical Education Simulation Center The UC Irvine Medical Education Simulation Center is a 3,000 square foot high fidelity simulation center housed on the University of California Irvine main campus and within the Medical Education Building at the UC Irvine School of Medicine.
