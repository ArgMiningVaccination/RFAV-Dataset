Some of the tolls we use include dietary counseling, supplements, and medical food replacements. Detox/Cleansing Our bodies are under constant assault from toxins in our food, water, and even the air we breathe. Though our bodies are created with efficient systems to cleanse us, they're being taxed to the breaking point in this day and age. We offer programs, information, and even supplements that can help your body cleanse itself naturally of the chemicals that, if left unchecked, can create serious problems. Bio-identical Hormones/Women's Health We have special expertise and training in this emerging field, including bioequivalent hormone replacement therapy (BHRT), along with routine screening, testing, nutritional counseling, and treatment. Evaluation and Treatment of Male and Female Hormones For both men and women with symptoms of hormone deficiencies, we offer testing, counseling and a variety of strategies to return natural hormone levels to normal ranges. Autism and Childhood Developmental Disorders Dr. Kalb has special training for care of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) children, using the Biomedical Treatment Approach. As part of our treatment protocol, we counsel parents on dietary interventions and provide vitamins and nutritional supplements that are helpful for these patients. Newborn Care It's critical to get a child off to the right start. Soon enough, any baby's environment will put toxins into his or her system. We believe a good way to fight those potential poisons is with diet and supplements that can start and keep your child on the road to good health. Immunizations We offer many of the standard immunizations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, just as in every procedure, people have to make an informed decision weighing the pluses and minuses. We believe that should include a shared discussion with their provider. The problem is that in an environment where there has been a rapid increase in the number of recommended vaccines, information about vaccine safety has depended on a reporting system fraught with problems. Ninety percent of vaccine injuries are not reported, making it difficult for parents to make informed decisions. We try to present the risks and benefits of immunization in a shared discussion, often resulting in a modified schedule for immunizations that works for the family. We also respect the State Law which permits religious or medical exemptions from immunizations. Evaluation and Treatment of Adrenal Fatigue The job of the adrenal glands is to help the body deal with all forms of stress, such as physical and/or emotional and mental trauma, acute and chronic illness, and \"life.\" However, many things in our environment can deplete normal functioning of these glands, which produce natural steroid hormones necessary for energy and normal functioning. Everything from toxins in the environment, to medications and the stress of daily living, impact the function of the adrenal glands. In our practice, we routinely test adrenal gland hormone levels and work with patients to formulate a plan that includes diet, exercise and supplements to help restore normal adrenal function. We recommend the book by Dr. James L. Wilson: Adrenal Fatigue: The 21rst Century Stress Syndrome, which details the importance of normal adrenal gland function. Heavy Metal Toxicity Exposure to heavy metals can interfere with your normal immune function and cause a variety of symptoms. In certain instances, we may recommend using special tests to help detect high levels of metals such as mercury or lead in your body.
