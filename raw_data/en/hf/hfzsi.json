Harshyne, PhD Expertise and Research Interests My research interests include various interactions between gliomas and the immune system. We are currently developing a dendritic cell-based vaccine for therapy of gliomas. Dendritic cells play an instrumental role in initiating and orchestrating immune responses within the body. Dendritic cells are located through out the body where they sample the local environment for traces of pathogens or tumors. Pieces of tumors are engulfed by dendritic cells that then migrate to draining lymph nodes. Here, dendritic cells activate lymphocytes. Activated lymphocytes then enter the circulation and attack infected or malignant cells. Tumors, on the other hand, have evolved many ways to evade detection by the immune system and to actively suppress anti-tumor immune responses. Our vaccine attempts to circumvent these evasive tricks utilized by gliomas by feeding dendritic cells pieces of dead and dying tumor cells in a culture dish. These loaded-dendritic cells are then injected back into patients to assume their natural role. Dendritic cell vaccination provides a boost for the immune system in hopes of preventing tumors recurrence.
