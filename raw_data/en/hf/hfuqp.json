The worl d's eight bear species are uni que due to their production of UDCA, and their bile and gall are valued for their ability to treat numerous medical ailments. This demand has driven the market for bear bile and gall, and has had a negative impact on Asian bears specifically, both within the wild and in bear farms. As the Alternatives to Bear Bile Campaign (ABC) Group, we developed a partnershi p with the World Soci ety for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) in order to increase the dissemination of a su rvey focusing on alternatives to bear bile more widely to U.S. TCM practitioners. We made revi sions to the existing survey and focused on an outreach campaign that included contacting TCM professionals as well as attending conferences and symposiu ms. The result of our work wa s the analysis of 47 completed and returned surveys. The surveys indicated that many of the alternative herbs and patent formulas were trusted and accepted, with the excep tion of a few. As a next step, we encourage WSPA to take the results of their expanded surv ey campaign, as well as our revised survey, and to develop an outreach strategy which targets th e TCM community within China. Our main goal throughout this project remains the conserva tion of Asiatic wild bear populations. Background Bears as Medicine In many Asian cultures, the demand for bear part s in traditional medicines is very high. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM ) prescribes bear fat, gall, meat, paws, spinal cord, blood and bones for the treatment of an assortment of comp laints ranging from ba ldness to rheumatism. The use of bear parts to treat medical ailments is not new and maintains both a historical and traditional significance. Use of bear parts in TCM may have begun in China nearly 3,500 years B.C. and the use of bear bile as me dicine was first prescribed in the Tang Materia Medica , published in 659 A.D., as the first official pharmacopoeia in the world (Williamson 2002 and Mills et al. 1995). Metabolically speaking, bears are unique. They are the only mammals that produce significant amounts of the bile acid, tauro ursodeoxycholic or UDCA (Mills et al. 1995). It is this acid which makes the bears so valuable to TCM and has been associated with medicinal benefits. In TCM, \"plant and animal products which are select ed for use are classified according to specific properties. These are: Four essences: cold, hot, warm and cool. Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 2 Five flavors: pungent, sweet, sour, bitter and salty. Four directions of action: ascending, descending, sinking an d floating.\" (WSPA International) Bear gall and bile is classified as cold and bitt er, where cold drugs \"are believed to be effective in reducing fever and inflammation, and by coo ling the blood, and detoxifying the body. Bitter drugs are used to dispel heat, to dry dampness, and to purge th e body\" (WSPA International). As a result, bear bile is used to treat life-threatening cancers, fo r soothing burns, reducing swelling from fractures and hemorrhoids, reducing pain and redness of the eyes, treating asthma and sinusitis, and for pain relief in general (Mills et al. 1995). Bear gall bladders are also an important source for tonics to prevent liver damage and to treat symptoms such as high fever, convulsions, spasms, and hot skin lesions (Mills et al. 1995). Demand for bear bile first came to the attenti on of Western conservationists approximately 30 years ago and studies have indicate d that the trade in bear gall a nd bile is highly profitable. A 1991 TRAFFIC USA report documented the market fo r bear gall bladders in 11 Asian countries and that \"gram for gram some of the prices in Asia exceeded the cost of narcotics\" (Mills and Servheen 1991). In North America, prices vary depending on where the ga ll bladder originates. The lowest prices are for galls from areas that allow or used to a llow trade, and the highest prices are for galls from those areas that do not allow tr ade or are in close proximity to major markets or illegal trade routes (Gaski 1997). Threats to bears There are eight species of bear inhabiting parts of Asia, Europe and North and South America. The species of interest for the purpose of this paper include those which are most frequently targeted for use in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Most bear species, incl uding Asian bears have experienced population declines in the past few decades, which can primarily be attributed to human impacts. Those species endemic to Asia, including the Asiatic bl ack bear, the sun bear, and the sloth bear, are listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES ), and international tr ade is banned. While specific population numbers ar e unknown, it is estimated that there are between 10,000 and 25,000 sloth bears and 40,000 Asiatic black bears re maining in the wild. Due to insufficient data, there are no population estim ates for the sun bear. The bear trade came to the attention of conserva tion and animal welfare communities in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when evidence indicated that the Asian bear species were in decline and the decline could be attributed, at least in part, to the demand for gall bladder and other bear parts in Southeast Asia and other parts of the wo rld (Williamson 2002 and Mills et al. 1995). One reason for the growth in demand is the expande d capacity to conduct trade relatively free of regulation over the Internet. There is also a ne w generation of non-traditi onal bear bile products being marketed, such as preven tative tonics and skin creams. Despite a ban on international trade in bear parts from these species, conservatio n efforts, and even the controversial practice of bear farming, demand for wild bear bile outpaces the supply. Studies of the bear bile trade consistently recommend educating TCM consumers on the illegal and unsustainable use of bear bile and the promotion of herbal and synthetic alternatives. Chinese medicine texts recommend Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 3 the Asiatic black bear or the brown bear of Asia as sources of medicinal bile (www.traffic.org/tcm/ChineseMedicine.pdf and Mills et al. 1995). Du e to this preference, East Asia's bears have been hit the hardest by the de mand for gall bladders. The combined pressures of commercial demand, habitat destruction, excessi ve hunting, and nuisance animal control, have depleted most of Asia's bear species (Mills et al. 1995). In addition to wild bears, captive bears are also used as a source of the much desired galls and bile. As a way in which to address the demand fo r the products, bear farming began in China in 1984 (Fan and Song 1997). Except for a few bears co ming from zoos, most of the original bears on farms were collected from the wild before 1989, prior to the issue of the China Wildlife Protection Law (Fan and Song 1997). Bears are kept alive on the bear farms where their bile is extracted by a surgical procedure. These captive bears are able to maintain a self-sustaining breeding population in China, and as of 1999 there were 247 farms with over 7,000 bears (Watkins 2002). Originally, bear farming was introduced as a so lution to the poaching of wild bears. Bile and gall from wild bears are considered much more potent, and therefore worth more than farmed bears. A recent concern is that bear farming could be generating an increased demand in bear gall and bile, which could resu lt in further poaching of the wild population (WSPA International). Prevalence of TCM Use TRAFFIC has published two reports on the dema nd for and prevalence of TCM containing or purporting to contain endangere d species. The first study, A World Apart? Attitudes Toward Traditional Chinese Medicine and Endangered Species in Hong Kong and the United States , was published in 1998, and used survey s to determine the demographi cs of those Hong Kong Chinese residents who use TCM containing endangered sp ecies. The surveys conducted in the United States were to identify \"the demand for and use of such products, as well as the attitudes of Chinese Americans toward the use of such medicines and the conservation of endangered species\" (Lee et al. 1998). The second study, A Tale of Two Cities: A Comparative Study of Traditional Chinese Medicine Markets in San Francisco and New York City , was published in 2004, and \"documented the availability of both raw parts and manufactured medicines labeled as containing tiger, rhino, leopard, musk deer, and bear\" (Henry 2004). Results of the survey in Hong Kong showed the belief that TCM use \"has advantages over other western medicines\" and could be us ed to treat diseases that West ern medicines could not (Lee et al. 1998). Similarly, the majority of Chinese Am ericans polled said that they used TCM on a regular basis and more than 79% had tried TCM at least once (Lee et al. 1998). Those surveyed regarded TCM as an effective and important part of Chinese culture and tradition. TRAFFIC's 2004 study addressed the availability of medicines claiming to cont ain certain animal species, including bear parts, in TCM shops. Seventy pe rcent of the 27 surveyed stores in New York City (including Manhattan and Flushing) sold me dicines claiming to contain bear bile (Henry 2004). Of the eight shops surveyed in the San Francisco area, 24% sold products believed to contain bear bile (Henry 2004). World Society for the Protection of Animals has al so published a report analyzing the results of several national surveys undertaken in countries suspected of being markets for the Chinese bear bile industry. Countries target ed included Canada, the United St ates, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 4 Singapore, Taiwan and Australia. The report, The Bear Bile Business: The Global Trade in Bear Products from China to Asia and Beyond , found that a variety of products were found in the markets and the products included manufactured bear bile medicines, bear bile powder and bear gall bladders. In addition, other source countries were revealed. They included Bhutan, Canada, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Paki stan, Russia, Tibet, Vietnam, and the United States (Phillips et al. 2002). The WSPA study surveyed a total of nine cities: Toronto, Mar kham, Montreal, Vancouver and Richmond in Canada and Washington, DC and New York in the United States. Sixty-five TCM shops were studied and of those 65, 75% sold manuf actured bile medicines, 9% sold bear bile powder and capsules and 12% offered gall (Phillips et al. 2002). Seventy-eight percent (78%) of the TCM shops in North America were found to sell bear gall bladde rs or bile products. The results of the combined surveys indicate that the demand for medicines containing bear bile is prevalent in North America and there is an evid ent need to address this issue within the U.S. TCM community. World Society for the Protection of Animals World Society for the Protection of Animals, a United Nations-affiliated charity, is the world's largest federation of animal protection societie s, with more than 660 member organizations serving over 140 countries. For the last 12 years, WSPA has been working to address the illegal trade in bear parts and products. As a way in which to address the inhumane treatment of bears farmed in Asia for their gall bile, WSPA has a great interest in th e use and promotion of herbally-based Traditional Medicines. These alte rnatives are both cost-effective alternatives to animal-derived products and help to ensure th e preservation of endangered animal species. Emerging Wildlife Conservation Leaders Emerging Wildlife Conservation Leaders (EWCL) is a collaborative effort between Defenders of Wildlife and multiple wildlife conservation organizations, government agencies, and private businesses. This initiative brings together ne w, emerging leaders in the wildlife conservation field for capacity building and intense training in campaign development and skills. The training culminates in the hands-on implementation of a two-year group international wildlife issue campaign. This effort is supported by the U.S. Fish & Wild life Service, Defenders of Wildlife, and White Oak Conservation Center/Howard Gilman Foundation. The EWCL Alternatives to Bear Bile Campaign (ABC) Group includes: Natalie Bailey Caroline Mitten Sharon Price Susannah Smith Cynthia Wilkerson Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 5 Purpose of project and paper In an effort to promote the short- and long-te rm conservation of the highly imperiled Malaysian sun, sloth and Asiatic black bear species, the Alternat ives to Bear Bile Campaign (ABC) project has creatively combined targeted research, education and awareness efforts to produce a coordinated and complementary initiative whic h aims to produce beneficial results for the targeted bear species. Specifica lly, ABC has addressed the threat of bear bile use in TCM by working in partnership with the World Societ y for Protection of Anim als (WSPA). ABC and WSPA have surveyed TCM practitioners in th e United States on treatments for ailments traditionally treated with bear bile. WSPA had already developed a survey and had responses from over 400 practitioners representing four count ries (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and the United States). The list of herbal alternativ es is extensive and includes over 54 substitutes. ABC continued the outreach effort by working with practitioners to determine which alternatives are prescribed most frequently and are consider ed the most effective. ABC project members developed and conducted an outreac h strategy in order to promote the survey within the U.S. TCM community. Activities in cluded attending TCM conferen ces and networking with key TCM contacts within the U.S. to reach out to the larger TCM commun ity. In addition, ABC worked with WSPA to revise thei r existing survey of alternatives and to distribute the survey to TCM practitioners within the U.S. Conservation Outcomes expected from the project Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitione rs in the United States are an important intermediate target for reaching the Asian TCM audience. Aligning efforts with U.S.-based TCM practitioners will allow WSPA and others working for a future for wild bear populations to benefit from U.S. practitioners' experience and wi sdom regarding herbal alternatives. Chinese practitioners are very receptiv e to messages and trends in th e world wide TCM industry. In particular, U.S.-based TCM practitioners play a key role in emerging TCM practices, ultimately impacting the TCM industry in Asia. Expanding the amount of data collected from TCM practitioners in the U.S. will provide increased support and rigor to advocacy efforts targ eted at reducing the use of bear bile in TCM in Asia. Because this effort is connected to WSPA's global efforts to advocate for bear conservation and welfare, the work completed th rough this ABC project will continue to have a positive effect on populations of wild bears that are under threat for thei r bile beyond the life of the ABC member involvement. As a result of th e surveys, WSPA can use the added results to reach out to Asia-based TCM practitioners to hi ghlight innovative approaches within the field that are consistent with the aims of TCM. Survey Information In order to address the use of herbal remedies in Traditional Medicine, WSPA has reached out to TCM practitioners within the United States to enc ourage their participation in a survey. This 6 page survey focuses on the individual herbs and pa tent formulas used in Traditional Medicine and the conditions they are used to treat. Over the course of distribut ion, WSPA has received Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 6 more than 400 responses to the survey from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. As a result, WSPA pr oduced a comprehensive report titled, Finding Herbal Alternatives to Bear Bile . (WSPA 2005). After reviewing the survey pr oduced by WSPA, the ABC Group ma de some edits to the layout and format of the survey to make the survey a ppeal to the target audi ence and to create a more friendly appearance (see Appendix 2 and Appendix 3 for original and revised surveys). The TCM Update and EWCL logos were added to the top of the survey and the contact details section was moved to the end. This change was made to encourage TCM professionals to complete the survey before becoming intimidated by having to place their name and address on the document. In addition, we added a brief pa ragraph indicating the expected completion time for the survey below the title as well as an expl anation of how we would use the information. A thank you to the practitioner was written both within that paragraph and at the end of the survey. To make the survey more visually appealing, we increased the amount of white space on each page and eliminated redundancy of the questions. In addition, we consolidated the \"never,\" \"sometimes\" and \"often\" choices above the boxes in the heading line. The box text was centered and aligned. Each question secti on was re-formatted to fit onto a single page with no spill-over onto the next page. Page numbers were also added. Finally, a section for general information, in cluding contact details and space for additional comments and suggestions, was added to the end of the survey. In this final section, the TCM practitioners were thanked for their participati on and a contact for more information was added. A recommendation for future edits of the survey would be to add an address for where to send the completed surveys. Outreach to Practitioners In partnership with WSPA, the Alternatives to Bear Bile Campaign (ABC) Group worked to develop a wider network of TCM practitioners and pr ofessionals to provide expert opinion on alternatives to bear bile. ABC employed two diff erent methods of reaching out to a larger TCM community. The first method involved contacting indi vidual professionals to gauge their interest in alternatives to bear bile in TCM. Eighty member organizati ons of the Council of Colleges of Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine were identifie d and subsequently emailed the survey. Follow- up calls were successfully made to 15% of those organizations. In addition, key contacts in the industry agreed to forward the survey to their co lleagues (see attachments for the contact list): Ellen Schaplowsky, President, The Tradit ional Chinese Medicine World Foundation Alexa Bradley, Assistant Dean, Yo San University Bryn Clark, Chair, Board of Directors, National Certification Commission for Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine Lixin Huang, President, American Colle ge of Traditional Chinese Medicine Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 7 A more successful method for targeting a larger audience involved atte nding conferences and symposiums for TCM practitioners. Overall, th ese combined efforts yielded 47 surveys, the majority of which were collected at the symposiu ms and conferences, which were returned to us for inclusion in our analysis. Symposiums and Conferences At three regional Traditional Me dicine conferences in 2006, ABC representatives staffed an exhibit table supplied by WSPA, using the opport unity to reach out to TCM practitioners and encourage them to fill out a survey on bear bile alternatives. In additi on, information packages containing campaign materials fr om WSPA's current TCM Update campaign were distributed and discussed. WSPA promotes itself under th e name \"TCM Update\" at TCM conferences, building upon the theme of \"Building Bridges of Integration for Traditional Chinese Medicine.\" A fact sheet regarding the A BC and WSPA partnership was al so created (see Appendix 6). While some conference participants approached the WSPA table and freely offered to assist with our efforts, others needed further informati on on our purpose and goals before they understood our objectives. A typical conve rsation was as follows: \"Are you a practitioner and do you use he rbs in your practice?\" or \"Do you care about bears?\" \"We're seeking expert opinion on substitutes for bear bile and bear gall. We realize that these are not typically used by U.S. practitioners. We are collecting information from experts on what you use to treat specific ailments that bear bile and gall can be used to treat. Would you mind taking 5-10 minutes to help us identify alternatives to bear bile?\" \"This survey includes information on both crude herbs as well as patent formulas. It would be a great help to us if you could take a few minutes to fill out our survey.\" Southwest Symposium, March 24-26, 2006, Austin, Texas http://www.aoma.edu/sw_symposium Two members of the EWCL ABC Group attended the Southwest Symposiums along with WSPA staff, with the objective of targeting and identify ing key contacts to rais e interest and promote further distribution of the survey. The target audiences for this symposium were Traditional Medicine representatives, herbal compan ies, and scientists. The EWCL ABC Group representatives assisted in disseminating information and surv eys at the exhib itor booth, attended several workshops, and spoke with key contacts a nd other exhibitors. The surveys distributed at this symposium were the original WSPA surveys, as the revised EWCL surveys had not yet been approved for dissemination. However, this experi ence was valuable for ABC representatives as the outreach opportunity was critical in developing additional contacts. 2006 International Conference and Exposition of the American Association of Oriental Medicine, October 20-22, 2006, Litchfield Park, Arizona Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 8 http://www.aaom.org/?pagenumber =6160 As with the Southwest Symposium, two EWCL ABC Group representatives attended the AAOM conference along with WSPA staff. The pur pose of our presence was similar to that of the other conferences. The team was there to raise interest and promote further distribution of the survey. Many of the attend ees were students and acupuncturi st who do not use herbs, and there was some initial confusion as to the reason for our presence. While a few people were under the impression that we di d acupuncture on animals, the majority of the response was appreciation for our presence and support for the wo rk that we were representing. We also did run into at least one person who was very put o ff by the approach that we had. The essence of her concern was that our approach to attempt to change behaviors in TCM was arrogant. Much anger and negativity was displa yed despite consistent attemp ts to communicate the background of our work. Part of this is due to the western background of the ABC members staffing the table and a small fraction of similar reacti ons should be expected occasionally. An additional observation at this conference that also occurred in San Diego was that many practitioners remarked that th ey don't use individual herb s and are moving more towards patented formulas. The first few pages of the survey are only herbs a nd several people flipped through it quickly only to determine that it did no t apply to them. We recommend that the first page clearly highlight that the survey will ask th em about both herbs and patent formulas so that they will be more likely to complete the survey. Pacific Symposium, November 2-5, 2006, San Diego, CA http://www.pacificcollege.e du/symposium/index.html The Pacific Symposium yielded the most successful survey response of all the conferences. Part of the success of the table duri ng the exhibit hall hours is due to WSPA's serving as a Gold Sponsor for the conference. The WSPA logo was printed on the conference bags and was featured prominently on the conference literature. In addition, WSPA was featured as part of the raffle ticket that participants could use to win highly valued prizes (inc luding a refund of the registration fee for that year's c onference). To enter the raffle, pa rticipants had to collect colored stickers from conference sponsors' exhibit hall tables. This was an excellent way to get people to visit the table and receive inform ation about WSPA's efforts. Another successful tactic was getting the conference organizers to make announcements (on Saturday evening and Sunday morning) to ask part icipants to stop by the WSPA booth to support bears. That request was enormously successful and we were able to get many surveys filled out and returned to us immediately. It was especi ally helpful that the announcement was made by conference organizers instead of by WSPA, as that gave added credibility and authority for our efforts. In response to our pitch many practitioners said, \"Well, I don't use bear bile,\" indicating that they either did not understand our pitch or that they had already made assumptions about what WSPA was doing at the conference. We responded by saying that th eir opinion was exactly what we needed - we wanted input on alternatives to be ar bile, not bear bile itself, since we assumed that no one was using it. It was in teresting to observe just how ma ny people listened to our pitch Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 9 and still didn't understand what we were doing. Recommendations for a more clear and concise pitch would be welcome as well as potentially anticipating the most common assumptions that people may bring to the table. These assumptions (e.g. that we ar e going to accuse them of using bear bile) are difficult to counter preemptively, but this will be key to increasing pa rticipation. In terms of drawing people to the booth, it would be helpful to clearly distinguish WSPA from other vendors. The exhibit area was almost excl usively vendors and a line such as, \"Do you use herbs in your practice?\" may put some people off by making them think that WSPA is trying to sell them herbs. A clear and non-threatening me ssage such as, \"Do you have a few minutes for bear conservation?\" probably w ould have worked better. An e xplanatory visual display could also be useful. A visual with a bear to draw people in a non-threatening way, for example, \"Help Save Bears,\" might still be interpreted from af ar as a potential accusation that current practice does not save bears. Something similar to \"Y our Knowledge Needed to Save Bears\" might work. The message needs to quickly peak their interest and let them kno w we need their help. There were several types of r eactions to learning about WSPA 's objectives at the Pacific Symposium: Excitement and enthusiastic s upport: \"Thank God you're here!\" Interest and engaged discussion: \"So, how will this make a difference in China? How can I help?\" Benign indifference, typically including the phrase, \"Well, I don't use bear bile.\" Or \"Stephen Colbert hates bears.\" Skepticism and disagreement: \"I bear bile all the time in sports massage!\" \"Nothing works better for varicose veins.\" \"I wish I coul d use bear bile, I can't get it here.\" Disapproval and disdain: \"Simply by being he re, you're criminalizing our practice and turning the public away from us.\" Or \"You can't dictate the practices of an ancient tradition.\" We found it useful to prepare full packets to hand to people. Several people returned at the latter part of the conference having re ad and digested the materials. We also recommend having a separate stack of surveys and th e cover letter prepared to hand to people who are looking for less paper to carry. However, the full packets create th e greatest opportunity to educate practitioners on the issue. There were relatively few surveys returned at the symposiums and conferences. The number could potentially be increased if there was an incentive to return the survey. One potential incentive could be a raffle with a nice gift donated by a vendor. MayWay is an herbal company which is active in highlighting threats of bear bile and could be a potential donor. They recently carried an article describing the threat that use of bear bile poses to bear populations. An additional way to increase return rates would be to have the surv ey available to be filled out online. The mouse pad give-away was very popular and could be used to increase the reach of the survey effort. However in order to determin e whether those that do complete the survey are TCM practitioners, there will need to be a filter for the online submissions. Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 10 In addition, there was an expressed need to identify products that do and do not contain bear bile. Most practitioners were s upportive of our effort to conserve bear s through the use of alternatives. However, it was clear that many did not have a reliable source of information regarding the ingredients of the products that th ey use and prescribe. This is particularly the case with the increase in patent formulas where it is difficu lt to identify the actual ingredients. Several individuals specifically request ed a list of \"good\" products. ABC suggests that a potential outreach opportunity exists to collect this inform ation and display it on a website as well as to provide wallet cards for practitione rs that list the produc ts and patented formulas that do and do not use bear bile. Response from the Survey Methodology for analysis of survey results As a result of our outreach, we received 47 survey s which were filled out on-site at conferences and symposiums or returned via mail or email. Each question on the survey asks respondents to indicate the fre quency of use of one or more herbs or patent formulas, e.g., often, sometimes, never or no answer (coded as a check mark or \"X\") to treat a kind of ailment (e.g., clearing he at and detoxifying). Th e number of herbs or patent formulas included in each question ranges from one to 21. We analyzed each question of the survey independently so that we could tease out the most frequently used herbs/formulas for each ailment. To provide consistent information for WSPA, we performed an analysis similar to that presented in Finding Herbal Alternatives to Bear Bile (WSPA 2005). We totaled the responses for the herbs/formulas for each ailm ent and calculated the percentages of each response type. For each ailment type, we sorted the herbs/formulas according to frequency of use. In the analysis, we used the to tal of percentages in the \"often\" and \"sometimes\" columns to indicate preference for a particul ar herb or patent formula. We examined how frequently each herb or formula was used and re ported those that were notably high or low. In addition, we observe particular treatments that have a wide va riety of trusted options, as well as those that do not. It is important to note that Finding Herbal Alternatives to Bear Bile included only herbs. This analysis includes both herbs and patent formul as, as well a number of additional ailments.

Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 15 WSPA has used previous survey results to reach out to practitioners to de monstrate the trust that other TCM practitioners have in a lternatives to bear bile. While some of these alternatives are highly trusted (70% of respondents said that they used Jin Yin Hua for clearing heat and detoxifying), others did not fa re as well (for both patent formulas used for treatment of hemorrhoids, more than 80% of respondents said that they we re never used). Several treatments have a variety of acceptable a nd trusted herbs or patent formulas, including clearing heat and detoxifying; br ightening eyesight and clearing liver fire; damp heat toxins; and lower back pain and weakness. Others, however, present limited choices, with less trust reported for these herbs or formulas, includi ng: nasal congesti on and discharge; bi syndrome; hemorrhoids; acne and improving skin beauty; and itching and hives. For these latter ailments, it is important to identify additional accep table alternatives to bear bile. Evaluations Evaluation of WSPA Outreach Efforts The ultimate goal of the alternatives survey is to develop outreach tools to communicate the prevalence of use - which indicates the trust in th eir effectiveness - to the Chinese public. It is critical that these efforts be evaluated in terms of their impact on the prevalence of bear bile use in China. Our recommendation regarding WSPA's use of the survey results involves random allocation of treatment areas in China. The ideal effort would include outreach in both rural and urban areas.. We recommend that WSPA randomly allocate si milar sized rural and urban (keeping the two separate) regions in China as eith er a) treatment or b) control. The control regions will not receive any outreach and the treatment areas will receive the outreach according to WSPA's current strategy. Both the treatment and contro l regions should be surveyed for information regarding the prevalence of the us e of bear bile before and after the outreach occurs. In both the treatment and control areas, the surveying should happen as close to simultaneous as possible. Regardless, the interval between the pre- and post- surveys should be the same in all locations. We recommend that the interval allow for the post-surveys to be conducted 6 months after the outreach has been completed in the treatment areas. It is important that all areas chosen as treatments or controls are separated enough, geogra phically and in terms of information flow, to ensure that no outreach efforts in one area spill into another. Because of the sensitive nature of use of bear parts medicinally, we recommend that the survey technique called Randomized Response (develop ed by Warner 1965 and described by Fox and Tracy 1986) be utilized. This technique was deve loped specifically for assessing the prevalence of sensitive and/ or illegal behavior. It is known that such sensitive survey questions may be perceived as threatening and thus leads to refusa ls or untruthful answers. The specific type of randomized response method that we recommend is the paired-alternative RRT format, also known as the 'two unrelated questions' techni que (Fox and Tracy 1986). Essentially this technique asks the interviewee to answer one of two questions. The choice of question is determined by the result of a random izing tool (in this case a U.S. coin) and the surveyor is not Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 16 aware which question the respondent actually answers. In this case, we recommend that the following 2 questions be posed: 1 - Have you used bear bile in the past 2 months? 2 - Is the picture on the coin that you have just flipped a \"head\"? [Note: a Chinese coin can be substituted if it is simple to describe the difference between the two sides of the coin.]. Specifically this randomized response methodol ogy involves an interviewee flipping a coin, keeping the result of the flip unknown to the surveyor, then reaching into a bag with 2 envelopes (one with a picture of a coin on heads, the other with a picture of medicine that clearly indicates it contains bear bile), choosing an envelope, then answer ing: 1) \"yes\" if the picture is a head and the coin landed on heads; 2) \"no\" if the picture is a head and the co in landed on tails; 3) \"yes\" if the picture is bear bile medicine and they have personally used bear bile in the past 2 months; or 4) \"no\" if the picture is bear bile medicine and they have NOT personally used bear bile in the past 2 months. The diagram below is altered from Solomon et. al (accepted for publication) to indicate the process as described. Stage 1: Flip Coin P1=0.50 P2=0.50 Heads Tails Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 17 Stage 2: Sensitive Question We recommend the use of pictures in order to redu ce any bias related to incidents of illiteracy in the population. The choice of picture should be pilot tested in order to ensu re that the pictures are clear and convey their intended meaning. Again, the interviewee should only answ er \"yes\" or \"no.\" It is cri tical that the surveyor not see the result of the coin flip. We suggest that th e surveyors cover their ey es or turn their back during the flip and reopen them after the res pondent has answered the question, replaced the photo in the envelope and the e nvelope in the bag, and return ed the coin and the bag. This survey technique allows the number of \"yes\" and \"no\" respons es to be translated into the percentage of respondents that have used bear bile in the past 2 months according to the equation: X x = ( [ - (1- p) y ] / p ) Bear Bile Question Photo of Coin Head P1=0.50 P2=0.50 Yes No 1- Yes Noy=0 . 2 5 y= 0.25 Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 18 with a variance of Var(X x)= (1- )/np2 y = known proportion of the non-sensitive beha vior (i.e. the coin flip question) = observed proportion of \"yes\" responses p = probability of answering the sensitive behavi or question (i.e. the bear bile use question) n = sample size The known proportion of the non-sensitive behavior ( y) in this case is the product of the probability of the coin landing on heads (.5) and the probability of choosing the picture of the heads (0.5) which is 0.25. Therefore, 25% of th e survey answers are expected to come from surveys in which the interviewee flipped a head a nd also picked the picture of the heads. Any \"yes\" responses beyond this number can be counte d as indicating that th e respondent has used bear bile in the past 2 months. The probability of answering the sensi tive behavior question (p) is .5 (as there is a one in two chance that the photo of the bear bile medicine will be drawn). The survey effort must be such that a sufficient sample size of responses is compiled in order for the randomized response technique to succeed. It will also be essential to p ilot the technique in a few different areas to identify any potential problems related to cultural acceptance of the technique or any logi stical concerns. It will be critical that the su rveyor be trustworthy in the eyes of the re spondents and that the respondents trust the anonymity provided by the survey technique. We recommend that the surveys be conducted in Chinese herb markets so that respondents will not have to go out of their way to find the survey. The surveyor should be non-threatening, preferab ly a member of the local community that already is accepted by the residents. Surveyors should be fluent in the local Chinese dialect and the survey should be conducted in that language. Additionally, surveyors should work through an example run with each responde nt to make sure that the respondent understands the survey technique and tr usts that it is anonymous. We cannot stress the importance of this level of acceptance, trust, and ease for the evaluation survey to succeed. If resources are not available to comply with the survey recomme ndations offered above, we recommend a more simplified survey techni que that is combined with the outreach efforts. In this case, the \"control\" will be a series of ques tions regarding attitudes and behaviors related to TCM use and bear bile in particular. Immediat ely after these questions, WSPA should have the interviewee look at the outreach material. Immediately followi ng that, the same exact survey questions related to attitudes and intended behaviors should be asked. We suggest that the following questions be used for such a survey: -Do you use Traditional Chinese Medici ne for regular health ailments? -Would you recommend the use of bear bile as medicine to your friends and family? - Have you used (or do you intend to use) bear bile for medicine? -Do you believe that there are effective al ternatives to bear bile for medicine? -Do you think that Asian bear specie s are surviving we ll in the wild? -Do you think that the use of b ear bile for medicine affects bear survival in the wild? Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 19 -Would you use herbal alternatives to bear bile for an ailment that could also be treated with bear bile? -Would you recommend the use of herb al alternatives to bear bile for an ailment that could also be treated with bear bile? A final evaluation tool would be to give the website for the Alte rnatives to Bear Bile Campaign out as part of the outreach in China and to record the change in the number of hits that the site receives after the outreach is complete. Evaluation of the EWCL Alternatives to Bear Bile Group In order to evaluate our internal effectiveness, the Alternatives to Bear Bile Group calculated the following metrics: 1 - Number of surveys completed (goal is 200) 2 - Number of surveys handed out 3 - Percentage of surveys which were handed out that were completed Generally, mail surveys are considered successf ul when approximately 10-12% are returned (aapor.org and ropercenter.uconn.edu). Since a survey effort involves personal appeals, we expect a higher threshold for success, but will use this 10-12% as a lower benchmark. We received 47 completed surveys out of a tota l of 305 (225 at conferences, 80 via email) distributed. This computes to a 15.4 % respons e rate. This was a su ccessful response rate which could have been increased further by: 1) adding an address to wh ich to send the surveys after the conference concluded; 2) personally fo llowing up on the surveys that were mailed out (only 15% follow-up); and 3) provi ding a clear incentive for practiti oners to return the survey. Additionally, the gross number of surveys receiv ed could be increased by attending a larger number of outreach venues. Nevertheless, our survey response did allow for initial identification of apparent trends in the use of alternatives to bear bile as well as gaps in the need for identification of new alternatives in areas where no trusted products currently exist (at least not among the alternatives listed in the survey). Conclusion This study suggests that there are several acceptable and trusted altern atives to bear bile that are prescribed regularly within the U.S. TCM pract itioner community. With the prominence of their use within the United States, ther e should be less resistance am ong Chinese TCM practitioners in regards to promotion of their us e in China. However, there were a number of alternative herbs and patent formulas that were either prescribed ve ry rarely or not at all. This may indicate that the practitioners are more likely to prescribe bear bile, or other non-listed alternatives, to treat patients. It may be difficult for WSPA to demo nstrate strong support for use of these particular bear bile alternatives within both the U.S. and Chinese TCM communities. Due to the limited trust or limited use of several of the bear bile alternatives, we can speculate that bear bile will continue to be prescribed to treat those ailments for which there is no Alternatives to Bear Bi le Campaign White Paper 20 acceptable alternative. This lack of options may continue to drive the market for bear bile and to hinder the attempts of animal welfare and cons ervation organizations to promote the use of alternatives. As a result of this small scal e survey, we make the fo llowing recommendations: Combine the results of the EWCL ABC revised WSPA surveys with the previously compiled WSPA results to gain a bigger picture. Include a mailing address to which to send completed surveys that have not yet been returned. Include a downloadable version of th e survey on the TCM Update website. Include a visible mention on the front page of the survey that indicates the focus on both herbs and patented formulas. Remove Shi Hu, from the alternatives list for brightening eyesight through nourishing the liver as it can be comprised of speci es listed on Appendix II of CITES. Include additional alternatives in the sections where none of the current options are trusted or used. This should give a better understanding whethe r other herbs are used or if this is where bear bile is most often prescribed. Develop a wallet card and accompanying website that identifies which patent formulas do and do not contain bear bile. Develop outreach tools to communi cate the prevalence of use of a lternatives to bear bile to the Chinese public. Develop and implement a scientifically s ound evaluation methodology in conjunction with the outreach efforts, following the de scription included in this paper. Develop a follow-up strategy for th e first and second contact lists. Follow up with contacts who submitt ed their surveys and have requested to be informed of the results. Based on the available research conducted into th e uses of bear bile and gall, as well as the evidence of a thriving market for the products, there is a need for c ontinued promotion of alternatives within th e TCM communities. The next phase of the project should take the information gathered from these surveys, dissemina te it to the appropriate individuals in China, and implement an evaluation strategy for those outreach efforts.

You may recall that we corresponded in late 2003 co ncerning our shared interest in the use and promotion of herbally-based Traditional Medicines, which are both cost-effective alternatives to animal-der ived products and help to ensure the preservation of endangered animal species. As part of our research, we seek to lear n more about the applications of herbal treatments for various health concerns an d the alternatives used in place of the more traditional animal-based ingr edients. Since the use of products containing endangered animal species is not common in the United States, we are especially interested in receiving in put from TM practitioners here. WSPA has created a short survey listing a number of herbal alternatives that do not contain any animal products but that are used in TM. This survey is not meant to be a one-size-fits-all comparison of animal versus herbal products; rather, we are simply trying to designate which alternative herbal remedies are already being used by the TM community in the United States to treat a spectrum of afflictions. As an expert in the field, your part icipation will be invaluable and much appreciated. We would be grateful if you could take a few moments to fill out the enclosed questionnaire and return it in the envelope provided. Also, if you have colleagues or a membership base th at you feel would be interested in participating, please feel free to share this survey with them. Should the results of the survey be published, the identities of all participants will be kept strictly confidential. The information provided by this exercise is vital for future work on developing and promoting herbal remedies and WSPA hopes this endeavour will mark the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between WSPA and the TM community worldwide. Once again, thank you for taking the ti me to complete our survey. We will be happy to share the results with you once they are available. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesi tate to contact me. Otherwise, I will look forward to receiving your response by February 25, 2005.

Wilkerson crwilkerson2000@yahoo.com What is EWCL? Emerging Wildlife Conservation Leaders (EWCL) is a collaborative effort between multiple wildlife conservation organizations, government agencies, and private bus inesses. This initiative brings together new, emerging leaders in the wildlife conservation field for capacity building and intense traini ng in campaign development and skills. The training culminates in the hands-on implemen tation of a two-year group international w ildlife issue campaign. This effort is supported by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Defenders of Wildlife, and White Oak Conservation Center/Howard Gilman Foundation. Each EWCL Class is charged with selecting, designing, and im plementing a conservation campai gn that will have tangible benefits to one or more species of imper iled international wildlife, while using the skills they have learned during the leadership and campaign training sessions. The Class of 2005 chose bears of Southeast Asia as the umbrella topic, then divided into subgroups in order to launch four independent but co mplementary projects to benefit these imperiled species: The Impact of Bear Bile Farming on Wild Bears in Southeast Asia: Status and Trends White Paper Alternatives to Bear Bile Campaign: TM Practioners Survey and White Paper Report on Herbal Alternatives Sun Bear Conservation Awareness Campaign in Southeast Asia: Education and Outreach Materials Toolkit Saving Sun Bears: Habitat Distribution Research and Sun Bear Education Center Development What is the Alternatives to Bear Bile Campaign (ABC)? In an effort to promote the short- and long-term conservation of the highly imperiled sun, sloth and Asiatic blac k bear species, the Alternatives to Bear Bile Campaign (ABC) project will creatively combine targeted research, education, and aw areness efforts to form a coordinated initiative which will produce beneficial results for the targeted bear species. Specifica lly ABC seeks to highlight herbal alternatives to bear bile and trends in Traditional Medicine (TM) by working in partnership with the World Society for Protection of Animals. ABC and WSPA will survey TM practitioners in the U.S. about the treatment s that they use for ailments that traditionally have been healed with bear bile. Over 54 herbal alternatives exist and we will be working to identify which practitioners use most frequently. Project members will develop and conduct an outreach strat egy in order to promote the survey, such as attending TM conferences and networking with key TM contacts in the St ates to reach out to the larger TM community. The results of the survey will be compiled into a r eport for outreach to the TM community around the world in order to encourage the development and use of herbal products in-country. Why are we here at Pacific Symposium 2006? Our main goal is conservation of Southeast Asian wild bear species. By working in conjunction with WSPA's TCM Update campaign, ABC members hope to learn more about Western trends in integrating Eastern TM practices with Western focuses on sustainability and preservation of species. By drawing from the experiences of the community in attendance at the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine's Pacific Symposium 2006 and sharing these lessons with stakeholders around the world, we hope to reduce the market demand for bear bile products that drive wild bear poaching and bear farming. We are excited to learn from your collective years of wisdom - from everything that TM itself has to offer as well as your experience in integrating TM in today's modern society.

Holdingconsultative status with the United Nations and observer statuswith the Council of Europe, WSPA forms the largest federationof animal welfare organisations in the world with more than120 different countries through its network of over 550 member societies. WSPA works to alleviate animal suffering using a combined and collaborative approach encompassing hands on work, educationalinitiatives, lobbying and awareness campaigns. Areas of work include stray animal control, humane education, disaster relief, farm animals and commercial exploitation of wildlife. In particular, WSPA is well known for its 'Libearty' campaign which aims to protect bears from cruelty and exploitation around the world.One of WSPA's best known 'Libearty' campaigns is to bring an end to the practice of bear farming in Asia.About UsBear report FINAL 09-05 24/11/05 12:57 pm Page 45 World Society for the Protection of Animals \u2014\u2014 Finding Alternatives to bear bileAlthough the vast majority of T raditional Medicine practitioners today no longer use bear bile, it is still consumed in significantquantities. The use of bear bile in T raditional Medicine datesback over 3000 years. It is classified as 'cold' and 'bitter' and itsuses include the treatment of fever, swelling and pain in cases oftrauma, liver conditions and sore eyes. Bear bile is still consumedin many different countries around the world, often as a result ofillegal trade. Some of the largest consumer countries includeChina, Japan and Republic of Korea. Bear Farming In the early 1980s, in an attempt to reduce pressures on wild populations,China started to farm bears in orderto extract their bile on a commercialbasis. The practice of bear farminghas since spread to other countries inAsia, most notably Vietnam and theRepublic of Korea. Most bears kept in bear farms live in cages measuring around 1 metre wide, 1 metre high and 2 metres long. Many bears are wounded andscarred from rubbing or hitting themselves against the bars of their tinymetal cages, where they cannot stand up nor easily turn around. Manysurvive in these conditions for over 20 years. In China a surgical operation is carried out to create a tube leading into the bear's gall bladder to allow the bile to be extracted. Untrained workerswith no veterinary skills often carry out this operation. The animals endurethe most appalling levels of cruelty and neglect. During WSPAinvestigations, bears were seen with inflamed, infected and bleedingwounds, open incisions for bile extraction and swellings in the abdominalarea. In some farms sick bears lay recumbent without movement. InVietnam bile is extracted using ultrasound equipment and a hypodermicsyringe, bile is extracted approximately once a month. In Korea, bears donot have bile extracted from them when they are alive. Instead, the bearsare raised to a certain age and are then slaughtered for their body parts.Traditional Medicine and bear bile \"We definitely do not have to use bear bile as it can be replaced by herbs, which are cheaper too.\" Dr Sun Ji Xian The Chinese Association of PreventativeMedicine, Beijing, ChinaBear report FINAL 09-05 24/11/05 12:57 pm Page 56World Society for the Protection of Animals \u2014\u2014 Traditional Medicine and bear bileFor animal welfare reasons alone, WSPA believes that the practice of bear farming should be phased out completely. However, many traditionalmedicine practitioners have stated that the use of bear bile is alsounnecessary and that many alternative remedies exist. Below are a numberof statements, gathered by Animals Asia Foundation (AAF), from peoplewho believe that bear bile has no place in modern T raditional Medicine. \"Herbal alternatives have the same effect - so why kill the animals?\" Dr Ho Ka Cheong President Hong Kong Chinese Herbalist Association Ltd \"There are many hundreds of ingredients in our Pharmacopoeia, and whatever beneficial effect may be achieved by using endangered species, there are equally beneficial effects by using other alternatives. Please understand that we are in the business of healing people, not in the business of causing danger to wild animal species.\" Word-Fei Cheung Assistant Manager of the Institute of Chinese Medicine, China. \"One main reason why I have, all along, participated in the work of protecting endangered animals is to make the public understand that the majority of Chinese medicine made from endangered medicine is not indispensable. We can easily replace them with herbal medicines, which are cheaper and easier to find. If the Chinese medicine community ceases to use endangered animals as medicine, it can not only join in helping to save endangered species from extinction, but can also raise the international reputation of Chinese medicine to that of a sophisticated branch of medicine.\" Dr. Lo Yan Wo Chinese Association of Medicine and Philosophy, Hong Kong.Bear report FINAL 09-05 24/11/05 12:57 pm Page 67 World Society for the Protection of Animals \u2014\u2014 Finding Alternatives to bear bile\"On Behalf of the Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine (UK), the largest Traditional Chinese Medicine organization in Britain. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly state that ATCM strictly condemn and prohibit the use of bear bile by TCM practitioners in treatment regardless of illness. This is based on the grounds that we believe the process of extracting bear bile to be inhumane and therefore unethical, especially it is against the general principle and Law of Traditional Chinese Medicine i.e. emphasis on keeping the balance between mankind and nature. There is no need for stretching to such an extreme measure to obtain a purely exotic sounding substance from an already endangered species, when there are countless other available alternatives.\" Dr Jidong Wu President of the Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine (UK), MiddlesexUniversityBear report FINAL 09-05 24/11/05 12:57 pm Page 78World Society for the Protection of Animals \u2014\u2014 Finding alternatives to bear bileIn its campaign to bring an end to bear farming, WSPA recognises that herbal alternatives to bear bile need to beidentified. With this in mind we are now in the process ofidentifying both individual herbs and herbal formulas that areknown to have the same properties or effects as bear bile. As we work to do this, WSPA strongly believes that collaborationwith the T raditional Medicine community is essential. To find herbal alternatives to bear bile, the first step is to find out what main actions and indications bear bile is purported to have. With the helpof T raditional Medicine practitioners in the United Kingdom, WSPA hasidentified four main actions and indications of bear bile. Though notnecessarily exhaustive, they are: Clearing heat and detoxifying Clearing liver fire Brightening eyesight through nourishing the liver Brightening eyesight and clearing away liver fire Using the information above, we have identified herbs that have one or more of the same actions or indications as bear bile: Clearing heat and detoxifyingFinding alternatives to bear bile Chinese pin yin Pharmaceutical name Ban Bian Lian Herba Lobeliae Chinensis Bai Hua She She Cao Herba Hedyotidis Jiang Cao Herba Cao Da Qing Ye Bear report FINAL 09-05 24/11/05 12:57 pm Page 89 World Society for the Protection of Animals \u2014\u2014 Finding Alternatives to bear bileJin Yin Hua Flos Lonicerae Lian Qiao Zao Xiu Rhizoma Paridis Zi Hua Di Ding Herba Violae Chinese pin yin Pharmaceutical name Long Dan Cao Radix Gentianae Lu Hui Aloe Zao Xiu or Chonglou Rhizoma Paridis Zi Hua Di Ding Herba Violae Chinese pin yin Pharmaceutical name Sha Yuan Zi Semen Astragali Gou Qi Zi Fructus Lycii Nu Zhen Zi Fructus Ligustri Lucidi Shi Hu Herba Denbrobii Clearing liver fire through nourishing the liverBear report FINAL 09-05 24/11/05 12:57 pm Page 910World Society for the Protection of Animals \u2014\u2014 Plant PropertiesBrightening eyesight and clearing away liver fire This list formed the basis of a survey we distributed to TM practitioners in Australia, Canada, USA and the UK.
