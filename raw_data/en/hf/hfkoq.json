Many of us take vitamin supplements. Here, Peter is calling us to spiritual supplements: faith, goodness, knowledge, self-control, and endurance. Each of these builds upon and complements the others. Peter knows that these spiritual supplements will strengthen both our walks and our witnesses to the world. He reminds us that developing these virtues takes effort, intention, and commitment. We glorify God and are blessed when we develop and live into these expressions of godliness. What are spiritual supplements? They are practices (also known as disciplines) that draw each of us closer to the Lord such as reading the Bible, praying, Sunday corporate worship, daily worship, Scripture meditation, Lectio Divina, or small group studies. While not an exhaustive list, it is a starting point. God has made us each unique, so we hear and perceive him differently. The key is to consider the ways in which God is calling you to supplement your faith then commit to that discipline or disciplines. Lent offers an ideal time to supplement your faith. For the 40 days of Lent, many people take on activities such as spiritual disciplines or give up ways, habits, or things that distract them from the ways of the Lord. Your divine invitation for today is to consider what supplements you may need and how to implement those practices. Do you need more faith, more goodness, more knowledge, self-control, endurance, or godliness? Ask the Lord and/or a trusted spiritual mentor or friend then commit to supplementing what is lacking throughout the next 40 days. Reflection: What is the Lord calling you to supplement this Lent? Daily Scripture reading and/or meditation, a small group Bible study, commitment to Sunday worship, a fasting regimen, regular prayer times, or something else? Spend some time asking the Lord what would allow you to grow closer to him throughout this Lenten season and then make every effort to supplement your faith for 40 days!
