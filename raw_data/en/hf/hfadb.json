The technical assistance at the University of Pennsylvaniaand at the University of Michigan was essential to the completion of the complexreporting and data management required in this survey.We are especially appreciative of the expertise, enthusiastic support and genuineinterest received from all who contributed to this pivotal study with regards to women'soral health. INTRODUCTIONThe 1990's marked the beginning of a decade in which major national efforts beganin response to awareness of major inequities in women's health in the U.S. by scientists,clinicians, policy makers, legislators, and the public. Included in these inequities were:inadequate attention to gender differences in research, barriers to accessing healthcareservices, lack of funding for women's health concerns, lack of focus on women's healthissues in public health care and health care professional education, and the dearth of womenin senior medical and scientific positions in federal and academic institutions.In its report on the Fiscal Year 1993 budget for the Department of Health and HumanServices (HHS), the Senate Committee on Appropriations stated: \"To date, there is nomedical specialty which provides comprehensive primary health care to women. TheCommittee requests that the [NTH] Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) incooperation with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the PHS'sOffice on Women's Health, evaluate a random sample of medical school curricula todetermine the extent to which women's health issues are addressed.....\" (Senate Report No.102-397, Page 143)This Congressional directive provided the basis for efforts to address the long-standing inequities that have existed in the education of health care providers of women(Appendix A). The leadership for action in response to the congressional mandate exists inthe Health Resources and Services Administration and the National Institutes of HealthOffice of Research on Women's Health (NTH/ORWH) in collaboration with the PublicHealth Service's Office on Women's Health (PHS/OWH). Through this collaboration and inpartnership with the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), and manyadvocacy and professional women's health organizations, significant steps have been takentowards determining the degree to which women's health, and sex/gender issues, areincorporated into an innovative, multidisciplinary, life-span approach to women's health inthe training of future physicians.This major collaborative effort resulted in the 1996 report: Women's Health in theMedical School Curriculum. Report of a Survey and Recommendations.' A need todetermine the content of women's health in other health professions was the logical nextstep.It is within the context of this need to learn more about models of education andteaching of a multidisciplinary, life span approach to women's health that the need to addresswomen's health issues in U.S. dental schools curricula was conceived. The AmericanAssociation of Dental Schools undertook the lead on this concept by conducting a survey ofall U.S. and Canadian dental schools. The NIH/ORWH, HRSA, and NIDCR providedsupport for the analysis of the resulting data and this report. The AAMC contributedguidance for this process based upon its experience from conducting the similar survey ofU.S. and Canadian medical schools. 8 2PART I. BACKGROUNDAmong academic medical centers there is an increasingawareness of the importance of women's health issues. A 1995 report of the Councilon Graduate Medical Education (COGME) entitled: Women & Medicine2 addresses the \"difficultywomen have in receiving comprehensive and coordinated care as a result of deficiencies in physician training and fragmented care.\" COGME recognized that multiple populations, including women, have unique health care needs. COGME, serving in an advisory capacity, provides an ongoing assessment of physician workforce trends and recommends appropriate Federal and private sector efforts to address identified needs. COGME is currently authorized in Section 762 (Part E Title VII of the Public Health Service Act), as amended by Public Law 105-392, the Health Professions Education Partnerships Act of 1998, Section 104(b). According to COGME findings, thearea of women's health traditionally has focused on reproductive issues in adolescent girls and adult women. As such, the reference for women's health care has been primarily confinedto disciplines pertaining to reproductive health and child bearing. This limited perspective does not take into account the broad spectrum of women's health concerns or relative differences between men and women in terms of health behaviors, morbidity, disability and mortality. This more limited perspective, also, may not recognize the demographic, social, cultural or political influences on women's health or their approach to health care.2 COGME developed a rationale for the development of a core women's health curriculum that incorporates the 1985 U.S. Public Health Service task force definition. The task force has defined women's health issues broadlyas \"diseases or conditions that are unique to or more prevalentor serious in women, have distinct causes or manifest themselves differently in women,or have different outcomes or interventions.3Inherent in the current expanded conception of women's health is the imperative that all health professionalsregardless of specializationhave full understanding of women's health issues, along with the knowledge, skills and competence to provide optimum care to women of all ages. In order to realize this imperative, the study of women's healthacross the life-span must be fully integrated into the curricula of medical schools.' COGME has established Basic Principles Underlying the Concept of Women's Health (Appendix B). These principles are intended to form the basis for curricular change and the development of academic and clinicalprograms in women's health. Basic competencies to support the principles have been developed, also.American Association of Dental Schools and Women's Health IssuesThe Division of Women and Minorities, established in 1993, evolved from the Office of Women and Minority Affairs within the American Association of Sental Schools (AADS). In 1998, it became the Division of Equity and Diversity. The Division, through its six- member Advisory Committee (Women's Affairs Advisory Committee WAAC), implements programs and activities as approved and sanctioned by the Executive Committee of the Association. The members of WAAC (Appendix C) endorsed AADS' cooperation with HRSA and NIH in efforts to address women's health issues in research, education, and health clinical services. The Study of Women's Health in the Dental Curriculum was approved for implementation in 1997. 3 Individuals representing AADS have served in the following collaborative capacitieSi Dr. Jeanne Sinkford:Member, Task Force for Women in Biomedical Careers Conference sponsored by theNIH/Office of Research on Women's Health, 1992Member, Task Force A Women's Health Curriculum: Academic and Clinical Trainingin Schools of Medicine, NIH/ORWH, 1992The AADS /Warner- Lambert Enid A.

(Appendix F)\"Women's Oral Health Issues\" were featured in an AADS/IADR Joint Symp6siumsponsored by Colgate-Palmolive at the Annual Session of the AADS in Chicago, March14, 1993. Drs. Lois Cohen (NIDR) and Jeanne Sinkford (AADS) co-chaired the planninggroup for this Symposium.Proceedings have been published in a special section onWomen's Health in the October 1993 issue of the Journal of Dental Education, pp. 736-759.The AADS International Women's Leadership Conference held in Cannes/Mandelieu,France, June 20-22, 1998 included: a focus on women's health/women's oral health,education, and research. Members of the Conference Planning Committee and supportersare listed in AppendixG. Procter & Gamble, and the Partnership for Women's Health atColumbia University provided major corporate support for this Conference. Funding for 10 4the planning of this conference was received from the National Institute of Dental Research.The AADS has included the advancement of women and minorities in dental education among its priorities since 1986. During this time, increasing female enrollments have altered the picture for undergraduate student enrollment and dental faculty composition. Females now constitute 36.3% of undergraduates and 22% percent of the full-time faculty in U.S. dental schools (Appendix H and Appendix I).The report of the medical school curriculum survey was completed in 1996. A comparable examination of women's health issues hadnot been conducted in dental education. Therefore, in 1997 AADS assumed the responsibility for design, conduct and analysis of a dental school curriculum survey to document current curricula content relative to women's health.Dental School CurriculaAnnual surveys of dental educational institutions are conducted by the American Dental Association.4 The major purpose of this survey is to gather information from dental schools regarding enrollment, administrative organization and responsibility, admissions policy and procedures, financial statistics, curriculum and faculty positions. The information is gathered in four sections: Section I contains general information (facilities, admissions, faculty, patient care), Section II deals with the number and characteristics of students, Section III details financialexpenses and Section IV presents detailed questions about the curriculum offered. Section IV of the Survey closely follows the methodology used in the Dental Education in the United States, 1976 study, which reliedon clock hours as the best indicator of the scope of the curriculum and found the dataon instructional hours made possible general comparisons of overall program length, the breadth of curriculum content and the degree of emphasis. According to the 1995/96 Survey of Predoctoral Dental Educational Institutions, (Appendix M) an average of 4892.6 clock hours of instruction exists with a range of 3997 to 8285 hours. The average clock hoursper week averaged at 30. The average dental school spends about 3920.9 hours in clinical science topics, 829.2 on basic science and 142.6 on behavioral subjects. Gender-related issues are not identified in the survey.The William Gies report in 1926 helped to establish dental educationas a university discipline and accomplished for dental education what the Flexner report had accomplished for medical education in 1910. Both reports continue to influence the educational environment. Major curriculum reviews for dentistry have occurred in 1961 (Hollinshead) and in 1976 (ADA, CDE) with the assistance of AADS. The Institute of Medicine Report, Dental Education at the Crossroads (1995) includes a well-documented report by Dr. Lisa Tedesco related to evolution, trends and educational standard setting for dentistry.5 Curriculum content is influenced today by the standards of the Commission on Dental Accreditation and Licensure (Appendix N). The Standards were revised in January, 1998. Standard 2, which deals with Educational Program does not include gender specific language. The Curriculum Guidelines previously developed independently by the AADS11 5 provide useful models that are not intended to constitute curricular regulatory requirements.Curriculum guidelines related to women's oral health do not exist.Competencies for the New Dentist were developed and approved by the House ofDelegates of the American Association of Dental Schools in March, 1997 (Appendix 0).Competencies as described in this document are abilities essential to beginning the practiceof dentistry. They describe the performance of graduates in dental settings and thereforereflect an interdisciplinary process in their development. The 63 competencies relate to \"thechild, adolescent, adult, geriatric and medically compromised patient.\" There is no specificreference to gender. The competencies document has replaced curriculum guidelines per seand is useful in both dental education and oral health care management. 12 6 PART II. THE DENTAL SCHOOL CURRICULUM SURVEYA. PurposeThe American Association of Dental School conducted a survey on Women's Oral Health Issues in the Dental School Curriculum in the academic year 1997 / 98. Its main purpose was to determine what is currently taught about women's health and oral health issues in the 55 US and 10 Canadian dental schools. Additionally it was also determined (a) whether this content is covered as part of the required or elective curriculum, (b) in which academic period of the predoctoral dental program these issues are covered, (c) how this material is presented (as a lecture, ina small group or laboratory, case based or as a tutorial), (d) by which disciplines the material is covered, and (e) which methods of assessing the outcomes (such as by multiple choice questions, oral examination, observation, or objective structured clinical exam) are used.B. ObjectivesThe objectives of this survey are 1.To determine what is currently taught about women's health and oral health issues in US and Canadian predoctoral dental programs, and2.To determine the degree to which these issues are included as well as the way this inclusion is structured.C. Design of the QuestionnaireIn February 1995, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) mailed a survey to all 142 medical schools in the United States and Canada to determine what was taught about women's health issues in medical school curricula. Thissurvey provided a framework for the American Association of Dental Schools to determine the inclusiveness of women's health and related oral health issues in dental school curricula in the United States and Canada. Questionswere modified to focus more closely on issues related to women'soral health. The instrument designed for AADS dental schools survey is included in the Appendix.After a short introduction to explore whether the schools have a separate office / program coordinating and monitoring the integration of women's health and oral health issues into the curriculum and whether there is a mechanism to assist faculty in increasing their competence concerning these matters and their incorporation into their teaching, the questionnaire started with a first section exploring the inclusion of general themes such as: the impact of gender, ethnicity/race, and poverty/socioeconomic status on women's health / oral health status/accessacross life stages. Seven specific areas of interest are then covered.These areas are:(a) biological considerations .13 7 (b) developmental and social issues(c) approaches to health behavior/health promotion in women(d) sexual and reproductive function(e) etiology, prevalence, course, treatment and prevention of particular conditions /disorders in women(f) impact of the use of medications(g) history, physical examination and patient communication skills A section with selected topics concerning health and oral health issues within andacross ethnic groups, ofelderly women, of women with a disability, of lesbian health issues,as well as legal and ethical matters, followed these specific sections. Several questions wereincluded in this section to assess attitudes and beliefs about dental education.While these attitudes and beliefs about dental education were measured by assessingthe degree of agreement with statements about dental education on five point rating scales,all other topics were covered in a five-step process. For each issue of interest, it was firstassessed whether this material was covered as part of a required course, as a separaterequired course or as an elective. A second question determined in which of the four years ofthe dental curriculum the material is presented. Questions concerned with the format inwhich the material was presented (as a lecture, in a small group/conference or in a laboratory,case based or as a tutorial),the disciplines involved in the teaching of these subject matters aswell as the method of assessment used for the topic (such as multiple choice questions, oralexamination, observation or objective structured clinical exam) followed. This approachallowed us to determine not only which topics were covered but also provided extensive dataabout the degree these matters were included in the curricula as well as how this curriculuminclusion was achieved.D. Conduct of the SurveyThe surveys were mailed by the AADS to the 54 United States* and 10 Canadiandental schools in May 1997. Fifty-six surveys were completed and returned which is anoverall response rate of 87.5 %. 51 of the 54 U. S. schools and five of the ten Canadianschools responded which is a 94% response rate for the U. S. schools and a 50% responserate for the Canadian schools. However, one of the US schools only responded summarily ina letter indicating that noparticular efforts were made to cover women and women's oralhealth issues in their curriculum. The results reported for the US schools are therefore basedon the responses of 50schools. The presentation of the results includes the results for theresponding U. S. schools and the Canadian schools separately. . The questionnaire was not mailed to the newly founded School of Dentistry in Florida (Nova SoutheasternUniversity College of Dental Medicine).14 8 PART III-A. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION1. General QuestionsOnly one of the US schools and none of the Canadian schools had an office orprogram responsible for coordinating and monitoring the integration of women's health and gender related issues into the curriculum.Table 1: Number (%) of the responding U.S. and Canadian schools with a women's health education office or programResponse Number (%) U.S. Number (%) Canada Yes 1(2%)0(0%) No 48(96%)4(80%) Unknown 1(2%) 1(20%).

Overall survey results in the nine major areas of concernMajor results are presented in the following section. However, this survey has generated such a rich dataset that it is impossible to discuss all findings in this first report.Future publications will focus on more' specific issues that go beyond the scope of this first report.In form of a general introduction to the results, it should be acknowledged that the collaborators at the dental schools were most helpful and willing to provide their time and effort in order to complete the information requests they received: However, many of them found the survey onerous because the materials asked for were not accessible to them within the context of the organization of their curricula. \"Gender\" was not part of the objectives, goals, keywords, clock hours, syllabi, examination information, etc. It became obvious from a follow-up with the academic deans and other academic leaders in the schools that often students or former students were the best sources of information on course inclusion ofsex/gender-related topics. Thus, oral histories of courses received from telephone interviews15 9 were used to help completethe survey. This reality reflects the lack of planned or studiedinclusion of sex or gender issues in many dental school curricula. Coupled with a similar lackof assessment and evaluation tied to gender-related issues at the school, regional or nationallevel makes gender a shadow topic in the curriculum.As a guide to the following overview of results, it is useful to note that the survey wasdivided into the following nine categories: 1.General Social Themes & Gender (6 items)2.Biological & Basic Science Considerations (10 items)3.Developmental & Psychosocial Themes (25 items)4.Health Behavior & Health Promotion (13 items)5.Sexual & Reproductive Function (9 items)6.Selected Conditions Prevalent in Women (30 items)7.Impact of Medications (7 items)8.History, Physical Examination & Communication Skills (12 items)9.Selected Topics of Concern to Women (12 items)The survey consisted of 124 women's health and gender-related topics which wereorganized into nine topic areas. Some of these areas are traditional to dental curricula and ourintent was to evaluate the presence of gender considerations in these common topics. Someof the areas have been targeted as possible interfaces between the area of medicine and thespecialty concerns of oral health providers. In these areas, the findings of this survey can becompared with the results of the recent survey of the medical curriculum to outline theinterfaces and point out the gaps (see Part III-B). Overall, one of the most significant findingswas the substantialinclusion of general medical topics within the dental curriculum.Although this survey provides little information about the depth of inclusion of these medicaltopics, it is revealing that in many dental schools, the curricula follow the recommendationsof the 1995 Institute of Medicine Report highlighting the importance of general medicalcompetence for the dental practitioner. 2.1. General Social Themes & GenderThe concerns addressed in the section on \"General Social Themes and Gender\" were:(a) health issues across the life span; (b) the impact of race, ethnicity and culture on healthbeliefs, health behaviors and health care utilization; and (c) the effect of poverty andsocioeconomic status on health and access to health care. For the oral health setting, thesetopics were rephrased to focus on oral health as a specific segment of general health. 16 10 Table 2.1. presents the frequencies with which each topic was covered by the 50 respondingUS and five responding Canadian schools according to the type of course in which it waspresented. These results show that the topic of gender is relatively underrepresented whencompared with race/ethnicity/culture issues. The impact of poverty/socioeconomic status is the most frequently discussed of these three topic areas in dental school curricula.Table 2.1.: Number of responding US/Canadian* schools that taught each topic in the\"general themes\" category according to type of courseGeneral themes:Part ofrequiredcourseSeparaterequiredcourseElectivenot offered The impact of the lifestages25 /38 /00 /09 andbehaviors & health careutilization31 04 /02 The race!ethnicity/ culture care35 /17 /13 /11/0 The impact /01 /0 *US/CanadianThe first number represents US, the second Canadian 2.2. Biological & Basic Science ConsiderationsThis topic area corresponds generally with the basic science requirements which form the core information for preclinical training in US and Canadian dental schools and comprises the material on which the National Board Dental Examination Part I assesses17 11 students. As can be seen in Table 2.2., the ten specific topic areas are anatomy, reproductivebiology, physiology, pharmacokinetics of drugs, pathology, epidemiology, pharmacology,and aging. It is obvious from the results presented in Table 2.2. that most dental schoolcurricula include these issues as a part of required course (62%) Very few schools includethese issues in separate required courses and only one school indicated the inclusion inelectives.Table 2.2.: Number of responding US/Canadian* schools that taught each topic in the category\"Biological Considerations\" according to type of courseBiological considerations:Part ofrequiredcourseSeparaterequiredcourseElectivenot offered Normal & abnormalfemale anatomy34 / 37/ in thepathogenesis of disease anddisease mechanisms34 / 27 / 00 / 05 / 1 Gender differences in thepathogenesis of oraldisease and oral diseasemechanisms32 / 27 / 00 / 04 / 2 Gender differences in theepidemiology of diseaseand disease rates29 / 38 / 01 / 05 / 1 Gender differences in theepidemiology of oraldisease and oral diseaserates33 / 38 / 01 / 02 / 1 Gender differences in theaging process34 / 27 / 11 / 02 / 2Oral health concerns inwomen across life stages21 / 25 / 00 / 010 /2 *US schools/Canadian schools2.3. Developmental and Psychosocial IssuesAs can be seen in Table 2.3., of the 25 topics only oral health issues and aging as wellas oral health issues during pregnancy and perimenopausal issues and the role of eating18 12 disorders for oral health are included in dental curricula by 50% or more of the schools.Gender identification and sexual orientation, peri/post menopause, impact of societal roleexpectations, and rape/other criminal victimization are issues that are least covered in thearea of developmental and psychosocial issues. These issues are covered in less than 30% ofthe dental curriculums.Table 2.3: Number of responding US/Canadian schools taught each topic in the category\"Developmental and psychosocial issues\" according /016 /2 Effect of on oral healthcare needs & services36139 /01 /01 / 1 Health & women:Childhood sexual/ physicalabuse23/ /02 /06 Impact /16 /02 /29 /2 Impact of /18 /03 /07 /03 2.4. Approaches to health behavior/health promotion in womenHealth behavior and health promotion are important components of oral health care.Dental schools have always emphasized prevention of oral disease. Table 2.4. shows that thistopic area is supported by most dental schools. However, the different aspects of oral healthpromotion receive strikingly different amounts of attention. Figure 1 shows that oral cancerprevention and screening is included in the curriculum of more than 75% of the dentalschools surveyed. More than 50% of the schools include seven more topics in the healthbehavior and health promotion area, namely (a) nutrition, (b) smoking cessation, (c) alcohol& substance abuse, (d) cancer prevention, (e) cardiovascular risk, (f) caries risk & oral self-care, and (g) periodontal risk and prevention. In contrast, less than 50% of dental schoolsinclude: adaptation to stress, physical fitness and weight, and occupational/environmentalhazards in their required instruction. Less than 25% of dental schools include intentional andnon-intentional injuries in required instruction. 4o ii'14 Table 2.4.: Number of responding US/Canadian schools that taught each topic in the category\"Health behavior/health promotion\" according to type of courseApproaches to Page 14a2.5. Sexual and Reproductive FunctionThe area of sexual and reproductive function has typically been considered a women's health issue. However, in the US and Canadian dental school curricula, sexual andreproductive function is not comprehensively addressed. Less than 50% of dental schoolsinclude 8 out of 9 of these topics in their required courses. Of all of these issues, only normalmenstruation is included in more than 50% of dental school curricula. Adolescent pregnancy,female sexuality and sexual dysfunction are the least covered sexual and reproductivefunction issues. It appears that dental schools have not included these issues that seriouslyaffect the health of women especially as both adolescent pregnancy and HIV are on the risein women. 21 cnCZ CI(\\I 15 Table 2.5.: Number of responding US/Canadian schools that taught each topic in the category\"Sexual and reproductive function\" according to type of Etiology, Prevalence, Course, Treatment and Prevention of Selected ConditionsPrevalent in WomenTable 2.6 represents the dental school responses to questions in the category of SelectedConditions Prevalent in Women.More than 50% of the dental schools include the following conditions prevalent inwomen in their instruction, namely cervical dysplasia/cancer, coronary artery disease, strokesyndrome, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lipoprotein disorders, lung cancer, oral cancer,sexually transmitted diseases, migraine & headache, osteoporosis, dental implants, dentures,periodontal rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disorders,pemphigoid/phemphigus.Two diseases which affect women disproportionately are also disproportionatelyexcluded from the dental curricula: fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. It is possiblethat the oral implications of these diseases have not been documented sufficidntly to merittheir inclusion at this time. 24 16 Table 2.6.: Number of responding US/Canadian schools that taught each topic in the category\"etiology, prevalence, course, treatment & prevention\" according to type of courseEtiology,Part ofrequiredcourseSeparaterequiredcourseElectivenot offeredprevalence,course,treatment 27/ cancer 28 / 00 /03 /0HIV and women26/ 00 25 17 Table 2.6 continuedFibromyalgia 16 / 14/ 00/ 010 / 1Chronic fatigue syndrome 16 / 05 / 00 / 012 / 2Alzheimer's disease 29 / 09/ 00/ 06/ 2Anemia26/ 19 / 00 / 06 / 12.7. Impact of MedicationsDental schools have a good record of including information on pharmaceuticals in thecurriculum. As can be seen in Table 2.7, the drug classes which are covered best (over 75%of schools) include contraceptives, tranquilizers and antibiotics. Two of these, tranquilizersand antibiotics may be prescribed by dental practitioners on a regular basis. This table alsoshows that more than 50% of the schools instruct their students in the pharmacology ofantihypertensives, antianxiety medications and dietary supplements. However, approximately50% of dental schools cover the medications used for weight control.Table 2.7.: Number of responding US/Canadian schools that taught each topic in the category\"Medication use\" according to type of courseImpact of the use of thePart ofrequiredcourseSeparaterequiredcourseElectivenot offeredfollowing / 00/ 1Tranquilizers 30 / 310 / 10 / 01 /0Antibiotics 32 / 39/ 10 / 01 /0Dietary supplements 26 / 18/ 00/ 05/ 1Weight control 19 / 17 / 00 / 09 / 12.8. History, Physical Examination & Communication SkillsTable 2.8. shows that more than 75% of the dental schools include a completemedical history, a medication history and a complete dental history in the curricula. Morethan 50% include a history of trauma, information on gender and patient-doctor roles,esthetic concerns, HIV testing and counseling, counseling for dentures and implants and oralhealth promotion. Only half of schools instruct students in obtaining a history of violence andabuse or consider gender in formulating treatment plans. Appropriate patient information is aprerequisite of appropriate care. Failure to consider the special concerns of women withrespect to esthetics, violence and abuse leads to less acceptable care. Furthermore, there arealso reporting responsibilities associated with these conditions. All health care providersassume legal liabilities as well as the moral responsibilities related to these problems whileperforming as practitioners and patient advocates. It is important that cultural sensitivity be apart of the training of dentists especially related to its influence on patient/doctor relations,patient motivation and follow-up related to chronic diseases.26 18 Table 2.8.: Number of responding US/Canadian schools that taught each topic in the category\"History, physical examination & Patient communication skills\" according to typeof courseHistory, physicalexamination & medication historyincluding sexual andreproductive history32/ 211 / 00 / 00 / 1 Taking an appropriatemedical and medicationhistory35/ 312 / 00 / 00 / 0 Taking a complete dentalhistory30/ 411 / 10 / 00 / 1Obtaining a history oftraumatic events planning & oralhealth behavior18/ 17 / 11 / 110 / 2 Understanding theinfluence of violence andabuse on medical anddental history19/ 17 / 12 / 210 / 2 Understanding theinfluence of violence andabuse on dental fear/phobia17/ 07 / 11 / 012 / 2 Understanding the impactof esthetic concerns ontreatment planning27/ 210 / 00 / 03 / 0 HIV testing and counseling 35/ 19 / 01 / 04 / 2Counseling concerned withdentures versus dentalimplants23/ 011 / 01 / 15 / 1 Oral health promotion 33/ 28/ 00/ 03/ 0 27 19 2.9. Selected TopicsThe least recognized issues in dental curriculum related to women's health were found under the following areas. As can be seen in Table 2.9., less than 25% of our dental schools consider health or oral health within and across ethnic groups. Legal and ethical issues and the issues of lesbians are part of the curriculum in less than 25% of schools. Oral health consequences in women with disabilities, women's oral health issues, gender in medical / dental decision making, gender specific communication styles and the effects of gender discrimination and harassment are discussed in less than 50% of schools.Table 2.9.: Number of responding US/Canadian schools that taught each of the selected topicsaccording to type of courseSelected topics:Part ofrequiredcourseSeparaterequiredcourseElectivenot offered Women's health issueswithin & across ethnicgroups9 / 03 / 00 / 016 / 3 Women's oral health issueswithin & across ethnicgroups9 / 03 / 00 / 014 / 3 Health issues of elderlywomen21 / 27 / 00 / 28 / 0Oral health issues ofelderly women26 / 27 / 02 / / / 2Oral health consequencesof disabilities in women10 / 23 / 00 / 017 / 0Women's oral health issues 14 / 23 / 30 / 011 / 2Gender differences inmedical/ dental decisionmaking14 / 06 / 00 01/ 01212Effects of genderdiscrimination and / 2 Legal/ethical issues inwomen's health9/ 05/ 00/ 012 / 2 28 20 3. Summary of FindingsTable 3 summarizes the average frequency for each of the nine areas of interest bytype of instruction offered. Considering the overall index - which is the weighted meannumber of schools (by type of instruction) that include the topics in a certain area - itbecomes obvious that biological considerations, medication use, and etiology, prevalence,course and treatment of conditions are the most frequently taught topic areas, while generalthemes, selected topics, and sexual and reproductive functions are the least likely areas to betaught in dental schools in the US.Table 3: Average responses in the nine areas of concern by type of classes offered(for the 50 responding US schools)Topics:Part ofrequiredcourseRequiredcourseElectivenotoffered to 38 /7.729.8Legend: * =the range of the responses of schools that do not offer any of the single topicsin this category/mean. For example under the category \"general themes\"between 7 and 18 of the 50 U.S schools did not offer a certain topic listed inthis category and an average of 10.8 schools did not have course offeringsunder this category.**= the overall index is determined by weighing the frequency of responses by thetype of course offered: weight (required course) = 3; weight (part of required 29 21 course) = 2; weight (elective) = 1. The frequencies were averaged to producean overall index. The higher the index, the more intensive the coverage.These findings are further elaborated in Tables 4 and 4a. Table 4 illustrates that veryfew schools omit taking an appropriate medical and medication history, and normal andabnormal female biology in their curricula. Table 4a provides a ranking of the most oftenmissed / not covered topics in dental schools. It shows that issues around female sexuality(lesbian health issues, female sexuality, sexual dysfunction, gender orientation and sexualorientation) are the most frequently omitted issues in US dental schools.Tables 4 and 4a: List of topics that receive most and least attention in the dental schoolcurricula of the 50 responding US schoolsTable 4.

Results concerning significance and future of women's health issues in dental schoolcurriculaThe majority of schools respond favorably with regards to educating future dentalhealth care providers about women's health issues. They are positive about the effect thatmore women will have but uncertain with regards to the efforts that will be made to increasethe coverage of women's health issues in their school's curricula.Table 5 provides the results concerning the questions about the significance andfuture of covering women's issues in dental school curricula. On the whole respondingschools indicate awareness of the significance of these issues and are positive about theinclusion of women and oral health issues in their schools' curricula in the future.Table 5: Frequencies of answers and mean answers to the questions concerning thesignificance and future of women and oral health issues for the responding US/Canadian*schoolsQuestion: How much do you agree/disagree with the following statements on a scale from\"1\" = disagree strongly to \"5\" = agree strongly?Statement: StronglyDisagreeStrongly MeanAgreeEducating future dental health care providersabout women's health issues is important.0/03/08/222/215/14.02Education future dental health care providersabout women's health issues is a neglected topicin our school's curriculum.2/014/018/29/15/13.02 Overall, dental schools do not address women'shealth issues in their curricula.2/07/1 116/015/36/03.36*US schools/Canadian schools31 23 Table 5 continuedEducation future dental health care providersabout women's health issues would contribute totheir future professional effectiveness.0/03/07/224/114/14.02 Future curriculum changes will aim at increasingthe coverage of women's health issues in ourschool's curriculum.1/010/226/27/03/03.02 As more women enter the dental profession,women's health issues will receive moreattention.0/05/115/123/15/13.57Major efforts will be made to increase thecoverage of women's health issues in our school'scurriculum.1/014/223/26/01/02.82 32 24 PART III-B. DISCUSSION of Selected Areas of Comparison With the Medical SchoolCurriculum Survey.The results in this area were compared with the medical school curriculum findings.The rationale for comparison with the medical curriculum survey was the overarching impactof these issues on the delivery of and access to comprehensive and integrated health care forwomen across their life spans.1. General Social Themes & GenderFor each topic, the percentage of schools covering the topic from the recent medicalsurvey results, the percentage of dental schools covering the topic as it relates to generalhealth in the dental school curriculum, and the percentage of dental schools covering thetopic as it relates to oral health are reported. Table 6 shows these results. Thus, for healthissues across life stages, 74% of medical schools included this topic as part of their requiredcourse, 8% considered it as a separate course, 19% included it as an elective, and 9% did notoffer it in their curriculum. For the dental schools, 47% of schools required this topic as partof a course, 14% as part of a separate course, none as an elective. Thirty-nine percent ofdental schools did not offer information on this topic as part of their curriculum. As far asoral health issues across life stages, 49% of the dental schools offered this issue as part of arequired course, 10% as a separate required course, 2% as an elective and 41% did not offerthe topic.Table 6: Percentages of coverage of general social themes in the medical and dentalcurriculaTopic: Part ofrequiredcourseSeparaterequiredcourseElectiveNot offered Health issues across life stages:Medical survey 74%8%19%9%dental (general health) 47%14%0%39 %.dental (oral health) 49%10%2%41%Race, ethnicity, culture & healthbeliefs, behaviors utilization:medical survey81%13%14%4%dental (general 57%19%7%24%dental access:medical survey 79%9%13%4%dental (general health) 61%14%7%24%dental (oral health) 64%12%5%22% 33 25 The comparison of the inclusion of general social themes between the medical and dentalcurricula shows that:a. medical school curricula address these issues in required courses in approximately 91% ofthe schools surveyed whereas dental schools include these concerns in 75% of schools,with the life span issues only included in 60% of schools;b. dental school curricula address these issues rather equally, whether the issue is of generalhealth or an oral health origin; suggesting that dental schools recognize the responsibilityof including significant general health issues as well as oral health in their curricula.2. Developmental & Psychosocial IssuesDevelopmental and psychosocial issues form an important part of the background forthe practicing clinician. Given the diversity of our patient and practitioner pools, and the poortrack record of communication across gender, medical and dental practitioners requireinstruction and exposure to the theoretical frameworks which will inform their clinicalpractice. These issues must be addressed as we evaluate gender and culturally appropriatecare in the context of culturally competent practitioners.Figure 2 (pp. 25a and 25b) compares the inclusion of these topics between the medical anddental curricula. (N.B. The topic areas which are starred are oral health issues and wereincluded only in the survey of the dental curriculum.) Three topics have a relatively similarrepresentation between the medical and dental curriculum, namely (L) impact of societal roleon health, (Q) health consequences of elder abuse, and (T) eating behaviors and disorders.Each of these issues are required in more than 50% of both medical and dental curricula, butnone is present in more than 75% of the curricula of either medical or dental schools.3. Health Behavior & Health PromotionHealth behavior and health promotion are important components of oral health care.Dental schools have always emphasized prevention of oral disease. Figure 1, page 14ashows that oral cancer prevention and screening is included in the curriculum of more than75% of the dental schools surveyed. More than 50% of the schools include seven more topicsin the health behavior and health promotion area: a.nutritionb.smoking cessationc.alcohol & substance abused.cancer preventione.cardiovascular riskf.caries risk self-careg.periodontal risk and preventionIn contrast, less than 25% of dental schools include intentional & non-intentionalinjuries in their required instruction.34 a 44 & Psychosocial IssuesThe name of the topic and the reference letter in the graph can be found below.

SUMMARYOne of the most significant positive findings of this survey was the tremendousinclusion of general medical topics within the dental curriculum. Dental schools recognizethe responsibility of including significant general health issues as well as oral health in theircurricula. This is important to the understanding of the relationship of oral health to systemichealth in both men and women. It is also important to the comprehensive care concept that istaught in dental schools and in the assessment of quality of oral healthcare of individuals.Dental schools have been exemplary in the inclusion of the impact of HIV & relateddisorders. The opposite was observed in the medical school study. Likewise,temporomandibular joint disease is included in all but 7% of dental schools. These aresignificant, positive efforts of dental schools to provide appropriate training for future dentalpractitioners.However, there is a lack of conscious or studied inclusion of gender in many dentalschool curricula. In fact, dental school curricula do not include general concerns aboutgender as consistently as do the medical schools. Twenty-five percent of the dental schoolsdo not consider the life span of the individual. In addition, developmental and psychologicalissues of women are not present in curricula of 25% of dental schools. Less than 50% ofschools instruct students in obtaining a history of violence and abuse or consider gender informulating treatment plans. These gaps in the curricula impact upon the ability of our futureproviders to appropriately treat their patients, and result in a barrier to health and oral healthcare for women. Future curricula for practitioner training should include the differences aswell as the similarities between men and women.The content with regards to women's health/women's oral health in general is notlabeled or identified as such in dental school curricula or course syllabi. In addition, theabsence of computerized curriculum databases, in most dental schools, contributes to thedifficulty in responses to data-specific curriculum surveys regarding women's health. In theabsence of a gender-based approach in the content, this becomes an important issue.The general responses received from U.S. dental schools reveal the following:Women's health/oral health in dental school curricula concentrate in the following areas:taking an appropriate medical and medication history, normal and abnormal femalebiology and effects of the aging population on oral health care needs and services.According to the survey, the topics addressed the least are: lesbian health issues, femalesexuality and sexual dysfunction.Overall, dental schools do not address a broad range of women's health issues in theircurricula.Most schools believe that educating future dentists about women's health wouldcontribute to professional effectiveness. 38 27 The schools are uncertain with regard to future curriculum changes needed to adequatelyaddress women's health concerns.Schools believe that as more women enter the profession, women's health issues willreceive more attention.Schools are uncertain as to the most effective efforts that are needed to increase women'shealth in their curriculums.As an outlook to the future, it might be worthwhile to consider the fact that theanswers to the attitudinal items concerned with the significance of women and oral healthissues were largely positive. This is a positive indicator of potential future change in thissignificant area of concern. Most schools recognize the importance of women's issues andexpect the increase in female students and female faculty to influence the rate with whichthese issues will be addressed in dental school curricula. 39 28 PART V. RECOMMENDATIONSBased on the information provided by this survey and in anticipation that it willgenerate interest and action with regards to gender issues in dental school curricula, theauthors put forth the following recommendations that have been endorsed by the Women'sAffairs Advisory Committee of the American Association of Dental Schools:1. There is a need to improve access to dental school curricula by using databasemethodology and technology to facilitate content review, reporting and revisions.2. Individuals who have institutional responsibility for curriculum development in USdental schools should consider an expanded definition of women's health (e.g. U.S.P.H.S.1985) in determining dental practice competencies in this area. 3.Individuals responsible for dental curriculum development should review the Council onGraduate Medical Education (COGME) Basic Principles Underlying the Concept ofWomen's Health, 1995 and assess their appropriate applicability in developingcompetencies for future oral health providers.4.Dental curricula should reflect a \"life span\" approach to women's health. This approachincludes girls and women from birth through menopause and past menopause, and aredefinition of terms and treatments for women of \"child bearing\" age.5. Dental curricula should redefine the scope of women's health beyond \"diseases anddisorders occurring only in women or disproportionately in women\" to include those thatadversely impact the health and well being of women across the life span. 6.Efforts should be made to enhance medical consultation training with regard to women'shealth and the relationship of oral health to general health. Emerging data related to: oralcancer, periodontal disease, and low birth weight infants, obesity and taste, mental healthand other factors that contribute to the health outcomes of women should be included.7.Less than 50% of dental schools instruct students in obtaining a history of violence andabuse. Efforts should be made to correct this gap for its value to appropriate care forwomen and to establish the role of oral health care providers as patient advocates in theprevention of violence against women. 8.Areas of the curricula needing specific review/revision are:integrating women's health into the basic science portion of the curriculum;improving the instruction of psychosocial and socioeconomic issues, where womenare disproportionately influenced;considering gender issues in access to care and in planning therapeutics andtreatments;increasing the knowledge of future oral health care providers in the social and legalresponsibilities of their profession especially as their responsibilities relate to womenand the promotion of health and well-being. 40 29 9. The content of the National Board Dental Examinations should be reviewed and revisedto reflect the growing body of knowledge affecting diagnosis, treatment and healthoutcomes of women.10. The AADS and NIDCR should take the lead in use of computing technology forinformation transfer related to women's health, research and treatment outcomes.11 An interdisciplinary Women's Health Task Force should be established within AADS tocontinue the assessment of women's health in the dental curriculum. This group isnecessary to facilitate knowledge and technology transfer; to identify emerging researchand research training needs of women; to assess health outcomes related to newertreatment philosophy and modalities; and to assure the clinical competency, advocacyand legal responsibilities of future dental providers with regards to women's oral health. 12. The DHHS has established 18 model centers to provide integrated and comprehensivewomen's health services to women across the country. Eleven of these National Centersof Excellence in Women's Health are located in academic institutions having accrediteddental schools. In keeping with the comprehensive, collaborative intent of these centers,it is recommended that a mechanism be established to include women's oral health inthese centers and in future models that are established. 30 PART VI.

The Committee requests that the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in cooperation with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) evaluate a random sample of medical school curriculums to deter- mine the extent that women's health issues are addressed. The project must examine at least five medical school currieulums, at both public and private universities. The assessment must include information on the amount and content of academic and clinical training covering women's health care topics. The Committee re- quests that ORWH and HRSA publish a report presenting their recommendations for a model women's health' core curriculum for medical schools.In addition, the Committee requests that the ORWH establish an advisory board for this project comprised of but not limited to the American Association of Medical Colleges, the American Medical's Women's Association, the National Black Women's Health Project, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the Consortium of Social Science Associations, the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, and the Society for the Advancement of Women's Health Research.Minority health initiativeThe Committee has included $43,000,000 for the minority health initiative. The minority health, initiative (MHI) is a major trans- NIH project that supports research and research training activities aimed at improving the health of minority Americans. The MHI will focus on the following goals: closing the health gap that cur- rently exists between minority Americans and the majority popu- lations; and increasing the opportunities for minorities to pursue careers in the biomedical sciences. The NIH will address the minor- ity health life-span issues, including infant mortality, health behav- iors of adolescent and young adult minorities, and the health status of older minority Americans. The initiative will also focus on re- cruitment and retention of minorities in a wide array of research and health care professions.Office of Minority ProgramsThe Committee has included $9,500,000 for the Office of Minority Programs. The Office of Minority Programs (OMPI serves as the focal point for coordinating overall NIH policies and programs for improving minority health status, increasing the level and scope of research on health problems that disproportionately affect minori- ties, and expanding the participation of minorities in biomedical or health service deliverycareers. Currently, the OMP's efforts in-clude: supplementary support for 1CD's projects that provide re- search on risk factors prevalent in minority populations; establish- ment of programs to increase minority participation in clinical re- search, including clinical trials; and development, recruitment, and retention of minorities in the broad range of careers in biomedical research and health services delivery. 103D CONGRESS1st Session SENATECalendar No. 201{REPORT103-143 DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERV-ICES, AND EDUCATION AND RELATED AGENCIES AP-PROPRIATION BILL, 1994 Szprzwita 15 (legislative day.

Therefore, the Committee encour- ages the Office, consistent with the general criteria it has devel-oped for the evaluation of health services outreach grant applica-tions, to extend delivery of health services to migrant farmworkersthrough mobile clinic programs.Building and facilitiesThe Committee recommends $942,000 for buildings and facilities,the same as the administration request and House allowance and $40,000 below the fiscal year 1993 amount. These funds provide for routine repairs and improvements at the Gillis W. Long Hansen'sDisease Center located at Carville, LkNational practitioner data bankThe Committee recommends $7,500,000 for the national practi-tioner data bank, which. is the same as both the House allowance and the administration request and $1,500,000 over the fiscal year 1993 amount. The $7,500,000 will be provided entirely through-thecollection of user fees and will cover the full cost of operating thedata bank. The data bank was created by 'Public Law 99-660 to serve as a national source of information on malpractice judgmentsand settlements and various other disciplinary actions takenagainst physicians, dentists, and other categories of licensed healthprofessionals.The Committee is disturbed by the failure of the Department to provide a final report on whether small malpractice payments should be excluded from the reporting requirements of the databank. A study of this issue was mandated by Public Law 99-660to be issued by November 14, 1988, and was again requested by theCommittee 2 years ago; however, it has still not been received bythe Congress. It is the Committee's understanding that this studywas completed during the previous administration. Therefore, theCommittee directs the Department to release the study within 6months of the date of enactment of this act.Program managementThe Committee recommends $121,976,000 for program manage- ment activities for fiscal year 1994. This is the same as both the administration request and the House allowance and $489,000above the fiscal year 1993 amount. The Committee concurs with the House regarding program management funds, and expects that HRSA will not tap into funds provided for programs in order to in- crease administrative accounts.The Committee recommends that $1,000,000 be used to establishan Office of Women's Health in the Office of the Director of HRSA.The Office of Women's Health will ensure that women's health isgiven the highest priority through HRSA programs in training, re- search, treatment, and service.The Committee continues to be concerned that most health pro- fessions schools throughout the country lack a comprehensive wom- en's health training curriculum. The Committee is also concernedthat HRSA and the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWIl)at the National Institutes of Health (NTH) have not made adequateprogress to address the inadequacy of women's health training in 447 medical schools. Therefore, the Committee requests that HRSA, incooperation with ORWH and the PHS Office on Women's Health,conduct a broad-based, national study of the adequacy of academicand clinical training in women's health in the education of healthprofessionals, to be completed by October 1, 1994. The study shallexamine the context of disease prevention, health promotion, epide-miology and pathology of disease, and the identification, treatment,and control of disease across a woman's lifespan. The Committeerequests that, in conducting the study, HRSA consult with spe-cialty boards, health professions schools, deans, women's healthprofessionals, Members of Congress, consumer groups, and non-governmental agencies. The Committee requests that HRSA pre-pare a report, based on the results of this study, which shall ad-dress the implications for accreditation and licensure of professions.The report shall also outline the effects of gaps in the knowledgeof health professionals on the care that women receive.MEDICAL FACILITIES GUARANTEE AND LOAN FUNDAppropriations, 1993 $10,900,000 Budget estimate, 1994 9,000,000 House allowance 9,000,000 Committee recommendation 9,000,000The Committee recommends $9,000,000 for the medical facilitiesguarantee and loan fund. This is the same as both the administra-tion request and the House amount and $1,900,000 less than thefiscal year 1993 appropriation. These funds are used to complywith the obligation of the Federal Government to pay interest sub-sidies on federally guaranteed loans throughout the life of theloans. These loans were used for hospital modernization, construc-tion, and conversion.HEALTH EDUCATION ASSISTANCE LOANS (HEAL!Appropriations, 1993 325,148,000 Budget estimate, 1994 26,458,000 House allowance 26,458,000 Committee recommendation 26,458,000The HEAL Program insures loans to students in the health pro-fessions. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 changed the account-ing of the HEAL Program; one account Is now used to pay obliga-tions arising from loans guaranteed prior to 1992, while a secondaccount pays obligations and collects premiums on loans guaran-teed in 1992 and later. Administration of the HEAL Program isseparate from administration of other HRSA programs.The Committee recommends guarantee authority of $375,000,000for new HEAL loans in fiscal year 1994.The Committee nsAtarticularly pleased that, in the fiscal year1993 allocation ofloans, a bidding process was utilized thatemploys multiple bids to identify the lender offering the best HEALloan terms for students. The Committee directs that this again bethe process utilized for the fiscal year 1994 allocation of HEALlending authority.The Committee provides $64,878,000 to liquidate 1994 obliga-tions from loans guaranteed before 1992, which is the same as boththe House allowance and the administration request.

The Committeebelieves that the Department should be able to fund this activityat a somewhat lower level of scarce Federal resources.The Office of Research Integrity carries out PHS responsibilitiesto investigate and resolve allegations of scientific misconduct. ORIwill continue to develop scientific research policies, integrity proce-dures, and regulations and to provide an accused scientist an op-portunity for an independent adjudicatory hearing or review whenan investigation concludes that research misconduct may have oc- curred. ORI is designed to assure that misconduct allegations areaddressed in a manner that assures fairness to all parties.Office on Women's HealthThe bill includes $1,000,000 for the Office on Women's Health,the same as the budget request. This Office has been funded in thepast by \"tapping\" the other Public Health Service agencies for thenecessary funds.The Office on Women's Health advises the Assistant Secretaryfor Health on scientific, legal, ethical, and policy issues relating towomen's health. The Office also provides leadership, sets priorities,develops policy and guidance, and reviews and monitors PHS ac-tivities in regard to issues of women's health.The Committee is concerned about the current inadequacy ofwomen's health training in medical school education. Because of alag in research on women's health, and because almost all medicalschools use the 70 kilogram male as their model, medical practi-tioners have gaps in their knowledge about the special healthneeds of women. Physicians, therefore, are not adequately trainedto address the needs of half of our population, which results inpoorer quality care for women and increased costs as some of wom-en's health care needs are misdiagnosed or mistreated.The Committee intends part of the increase for the Office to beused to examine issues surrounding the appropriate integration ofwomen's health issues into medical school curricula. The Commit-tee directs that the Office work with the various agencies of thePublic Health Service, in particular the Health Resources andServices Administration, to study the improvement of competenciesin training in the care of women with the goal of educating all phy-sicians in the full range of women's health issues and ending thefragmentation of women's health care. This will ensure the provi-sion of optimal health care to women. 7 5 The study should be broad-based, including specialty boards,women's health professionals, specialists in women's health, Mem-bers of Congress, medical school representatives, and consumergroups. The Committee would like to receive this study by Feb-ruary 1, 1994.Office of Emergency PreparednessThe bill includes $1,500,000 for the Office of Emergency Pre-paredness, a reduction of $1,500,000 from the budget request. ThisOffice has been funded in the past by \"tapping' the other PublicHealth Service agencies for the necessary funds. Because of budg-etary constraints on discretionary spending, the Committee wasunable to provide the full amount requested.The Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP) is responsible forplanning, implementing, and coordinating the Departmental re-sponse to a disaster. MIS is the primary agency for health andmedical services under the Federal Response Plan, and responsibil-ity for the entire Departmental response was delegated to OEP in1990. Medical, mental health, and human services are provided tovictims of catastrophic disasters under the Federal Response Plan.Health Care Reform Data AnalysisThe Committee recommends $3,000,000 to initiate a data im-provement and analytical effort in support of health care reform.This is $2,000,000 less than the amount requested because of over-all budgetary constraints.This initiative would fund several interagency efforts aimed atthe improvement, expansion and analysis of data in support ofhealth care reform in the areas of employer-provided health insur-ance, population estimates of health insurance coverage, the effi-cacy of various cost containment approaches, and related areas.Health care reform efforts will require timely and systematic na-tional information on employer-provided health insurance as wellas employer/employee sharing, of premium costs.Public Health Service ManagementFor Public HealthService Management, the billincludes S19,379,000, a reduction of $2,000,000 from the request and fromthe 1993 appropriation. This activity provides support for the As-sistant Secretary for Health to assure effective guidance, leader-ship, and direction of the Public Health Service programs. In an ef-fort to reduce administrative and overhead costs, the Committeerecommends this reduction. This reduction should be able to be ab-sorbed without seriously affecting any critical activity of the Fed-eral Government.Within the total, the Committee has provided $200,000 for theOffice of Public Health History to conduct an inventory and evalua-tion of public health materials and programs in use in informaleducation settings.The Committee has made several reductions in this account forthe staffing of offices, i.e. Emergency Preparedness, Research In-tegrity. The Committee directs the Department to refrain from\"tapping\" funds from other PHS agencies to restore these reduc- 851 APPENDIX B 52 Basic Principles Underlying the Concept of Women's HealthThe biopsychosocial approach is fundamental to an integrated understandingof women's health issues.A scientific knowledge base is essential in advancing research, education andclinical care in women's health.Gender issues must be considered in every aspect of health.The uniqueness of individuals and their personal experience informs andguides the appropriate provision of health care.The relationship between women and their providers is an interactive processdefined by mutual respect and collaboration.Women's health requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates contentfrom various disciplines such as nursing, nutrition, dentistry, women'sstudies, psychiatry and the behavioral sciences.Innovative clinical models are needed to provide comprehensive care towomen and training for physicians, including prevention, communityinvolvement and education.Fundamental in the development of a women's health curriculum is theability to respond to the needs of the traditionally economically, socially,and culturally excluded populations. The evolution of a curriculum mustreflect the diversity of the population.Medical education is as much a socialization process as it is an acquisition ofskills and knowledge. Women's health cannot be taught only didactically.Women's health would benefit from women in leadership and policy makingpositions in all aspects of health care. Efforts must be made to recruit andpromote women into these positions.These principles are not unique to women's health but, applied broadly, wouldbenefit the entire population. The rationale for focusing on women's health isthat women have been the ones least well served by the current system. Source: Council on Graduate Medical Education. Fifth Report: women and medicine.

Neidle ScholarTo:Dr. Janet B. Henrich, Associate Professor of MedicineYale University School of MedicineFor inclusion in Women's Health in the Medical School CurriculumJune 2, 1995 57 ORAL AND DENTAL HEALTH Oral health refers to the status and function of the oral cavity and associated structures. Because of theimportance of the oral cavity to the processes of mastication, taste, digestion, respiration andcommunication, oral health is fundamental to systemic well-being. Tissues of the oral cavity are subject tomany diseases with significant morbidity and mortality. These include cancer, salivary gland dysfunctionand connective tissue diseases. Eating disorders, infectious diseases, hormonal influences and inadequatehealth behaviors also negatively affect oral health status. In discussing women's oral health issues, theintegral relationship of oral health to systemic health must be acknowledged.Oral health encompasses dental health and focuses on the structures in and around the mouth. Bonyanatomy includes the facial skeleton, mandible and maxilla, alveolar bone and temporomandibular jointarea. The oral cavity is bounded by the lips and cheeks and includes the teeth, periodontium, hard and softpalates and tongue. The muscles of mastication, salivary glands, lymphoid tissues and deep spaces of thehead and neck are also components of the oral system.Two major oral diseases are dental caries and periodontal disease. The etiology of both is essentiallybacterial in origin. Dental caries remains one of the most prevalent human diseases. Carious lesionsdamage the hard tissue of the tooth and are typically classified by their location on coronal or rootsurfaces. The use of flouride has proven to be effective in the prevention of tooth decay. As with dentalcaries, diseases of the periodontium may only be prevented or controlled not cured. Periodontal diseasesaffect the supporting structures of the dentition including the gingiva, cementum, alveolar bone andperiodontal membrane. Disorders of the periodontium occur on a continuum that includes gingivitis,periodontitis, and edentulism in terminal stages.Gender differences in the areas of oral health and disease have been addressed only minimally. Until theNHANES III survey of oral health is released, results from the 1985-1986 National Survey of U.S.Employed Adults and Seniors provide the most current analysis of gender differences related to basic oralhealth indicators. To summarize, differences in tooth loss patterns (edentulism) were minimal, with olderwomen demonstrating a higher prevalence of intact dentition. Males exhibited more periodontal disorderssuch as gingivitis, recession, and loss of attachment than did females. Women and men differed on thetypes of carious lesions present, with a greater prevalence of coronal caries among women and root cariesamong men. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) summary information;women are one-third as likely as men to develop orofacial neoplasms. Conversely, analysis of the 1989National Health Interview Survey supplement indicated consistently higher prevalence rates in females forall types of orofacial pain. Clinical reports are consistent with this evidence in that women report a muchhigher frequency of temporomandibular joint dysfunction and myofascial pain.Sjogren'ssyndromeisan autoimmunediseasecausingdrymouth(xerostomia)andeyes(keratoconjuctivitis sicca). Ninety percent of all cases occur in women, with 50 years of age being theaverage time of onset. Patients with xerostomia associated with Sjogren's or other causes are at increasedrisk of caries, periodontal disease and oral candidiasis. Approximately half of those affected exhibitenlargement of the parotid gland. Arthralgia, myalgia and fatigue are common symptoms.Although erosion of the dental enamel may have many causes, eating disorders, particularly bulimianervosa, are notable. Bulimia nervosa is estimated to affect one to three percent of adolescent and youngadult women, placing them at risk for related oral problems. The pattern of erosion associated with chronicvomiting is usually most common on the lingual surfaces of the teeth, although all surfaces may beaffected. Severe erosion of the enamel weakens the tooth structure and damages soft tissues; exposure ofsofter dentin and cementum surfaces increases the risk caries. Soft tissue manifestations such as58 ulceration, glossitis, mucositis and periodontal abnormalities may result from nutritional deficienciesrelated to eating or metabolic disorders.An increasing proportion of those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are women. Themost common mode of transmission in women is through injection drug use, followed by sexual contactwith an infected partner. Seropositive mothers are the primary source of HIV infection in infants. In NorthAmerica, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is among the ten leading causes of death inwomen of childbearing age. Because of early manifestations of the disease often occur in the mouth,health care professionals should be familiar with the presentation of common oral lesions associated withHIV, especially oral candidiasis and hairy leukoplalcia.Hormonal influences on the oral cavity during pregnancy have been well-documented. Generalizedgingival hyperplasia may result from alteration of the hormonal environment (specifically an increase inprogesterone) coupled with local irritants. This condition, sometimes incorrectly termed a \"pregnancytumor,\" is also associated with puberty. It appears to be transient with no significant loss of periodontalattachment. The effects of menopause or postmenopausal conditions such as osteoporosis on oralconditions have not been comprehensively addressed. The belief that reduced salivary flow accompaniesthe normal aging process in healthy individuals has not been proven. Instead, xerostomia secondary toother systemic conditions or drug therapy, concurrent with aging, appears more common. With theimpending demographic shift, the increased percentage of older women in the general population shouldfocus attention on prevalent conditions and related oral manifestations.Nearly half of American homes will be directly affected by domestic violence at some time. Women suffermore severe physical injuries associated with non-accidental trauma and are more likely to requiresubsequent hospitalization. Because the majority of injuries involve the head and neck region, oral andmaxillofacial trauma is often the reason that domestic violence victims initially seek care. Healthprofessionals should be alert to the relationship of non-accidental trauma to patterns of delayed care,injuries at various stages of healing, conditions inconsistent with history, or long-term interpersonaldifficulties.The influences of economic, social, psychological and behavioral factors on women's oral health have notbeen fully explored. Nearly 75 percent of individuals living in poverty in the United States are women andchildren. Low socioeconomic status is typically associated with poorer health status, need for oral healthservices and barriers to access. Nonetheless, women are known to be higher utilizers of dental and medicalcare, to practice more frequent preventive health behaviors and to place greater value on dental estheticsthan men. Where clinical indicators of women's oral health status appear positive, the factors influencingthese outcomes are not fully understood. Also, the increased proportion of women among the growingolder adult population may influence trends in oral epidemiology. Only a comprehensive approach to thestudy of women's oral health and disease will permit a complete picture to emerge. 59 EDUCATIONAL/TRAINING OBJECTIVESAll students should demonstrate appropriate knowledge, skills, attitudes and behavior in the followingareas:The relationship of oral health to systemic well-being.An understanding of the structures and functions of the oral system.Performance of an oral examination.Knowledge of common oral diseases and conditions, with emphasis on how they are manifested inwomen.The epidemiology of oral diseases in women, especially as they are influenced by the impendingdemographic shift.Acknowledgement that economic, social, psychological and behavioral factors may affect women'soral health.Appropriate referral mechanisms for oral health care. 60 BIBLIOGRAPHYShiboski CH, Hilton JF, Greenspan D, et al.

I am an endocrinologist,caring for patients with metabolic bone diseases, including osteoporosis. I also have a PhDand my research concerns osteoclast-related bone destruction. At the School of DentalMedicine, I instruct predoctoral dental students in required medicine and medical practicetopic areas. It is my pleasure to present testimony on behalf of the American Associationof Dental Schools. The AADS represents the 55 U.S. and 10 Canadian dental schools, thepostgraduate programs in dentistry and the allied oral health professional schools. TheAADS works closely with the research community on matters related to education andtraining. The AADS is the one national organization that speaks on behalf of dentaleducation.As a physician teaching in an oral health care setting, I have been exposed to aunique set of circumstances which I would like to share with you. I would like to start byasking you to recognize that everything I wish to convey in this testimony can becondensed into two messages. First, oral health is an integral part of general health andshould be considered whenever health needs are discussed. Second, postmenopausalwomen, elderly women and frail elderly women need oral health care. In addition, theyneed a proper integration of oral health and health care to decrease morbidity andmortality and to secure a better quality of life for themselves.My goal is to place you comfortably into the perspective contained in these twomessages. To do so, I will discuss several issues which have led me to these conclusions,illustrate the issues with a case presentation, comment on initiatives in progress toimplement change and conclude with short list of recommendations for improving the oralhealth and general health landscape.Oral Health Care Economics and ImpactFirst, I would like to acquaint you with data showing that dental and oral diseasesaffect most older Americans. 99.5% of Americans 65 years and older have had cavitiesand 40% of these elderly Americans have lost all of their teeth (1.). Of those who arepoor, a disproportionate number (50%), are also edentulous (2). In general, in theedentulous elderly population, only 10% had a yearly dental visit (3) .In addition, those inpoorer health or limited by disability show a 28% decrease in regular oral health followupvisits. (4) By the year 2000, it is estimated that 62.3 billion dollars will be spent yearly ondental services. Yet, only 15% of those 65 and older have dental insurance. The PublicHealth Report concludes that \"oral diseases remain an unnecessary obstacle to betterhealth\".Gender specific data on women shows that increasing age is accompanied by anincrease in the edentulous population. While women aged 45 -54 have only a 12%prevalence of complete loss of teeth, 46% of women over 75 years of age have lost alltheir teeth (4). The loss of teeth does not signal an end to the need for oral health care. Infact, the health problems of edentulous patients demand continued care. The vast majorityof nursing home residents are women. New nursing home regulations on oral health carehave been in place for two years, but oral health screening is not standardized and no 164 provision is made for coverage of oral health care costs unless the service required is an emergency or is covered by Medicare.Oral Health Diseases of Postmenopausal and Elderly Women In addition, alitany of conditions present orally, undermining an elderly person's quality of life. Several of the mostcommon oral health diseases occur more frequently in elderlywomen. Temporomandibular Disease-Headache is a very common presenting complaint. Thesymptoms of headache range from stress and hypoglycemia to brain tumor and meningitis. Oral health practitioners are often consulted for chronic headaches. One of the causes of chronic headache is temporomandibular joint syndrome. Women have a higher rate ofheadache from temporomandibular joint syndrome than men. It has been reported thatwomen present for treatment for temporomandibular symptoms 5 times as frequently asmen. (5). Since chronic headache is a debilitating condition, solving and treating headachesymptoms appropriately may require input from an oral health practitioner (6).Trigeminal Neuralgia-An excruciating burst of painacross the face, triggered by gentle touch or by a change in the position of the neck, may be a sign of this painful chroniccondition. The pain may be caused by a variety of conditions, some benign and otherswhich are life-threatening. Trigeminal neuralgia is more common in women, and its onsetis highest in the fifth decade. Oral health practitioners diagnose the origin of these symptoms and treat this chronic condition.Atypical Facial Pain,-Atypical facial pain is a chronic pain disorder which occurs mostfrequently in women (female:male ratio is 19:1). Often these patients have been treated bymultiple health care providers and have had extensive workups for tumor and multipleroot canals for possible tooth involvement. More effective integration of care between oralhealth practitioners and physicians would be helpful in decreasing the number ofinterventions these patients suffer before the syndrome is recognized.Pemphigus -Women are more likely to be affected by autoimmune disease than men.Pemphigus is a blistering deforming disease which may present with mainly oral lesions ormay involve a large enough area of the skin to be life-threatening. Treatment of the oraland skin lesions should be coordinated by the integration of oral health services with thedermatology treatments. Many of the medications used to treat pemphigus have seriousside effects: aplastic anemia can be caused by methotrexate, osteoporosis and fracturesresult from corticosteroid treatment. Since the total accumulated dose of these agentsdetermines the severity of some of these complications, both the oral health practitioner and the physician need to coordinate care to effectively treat the disease and minimize the complications. (7).Burning Mouth isan oral and taste disorder of postmenopausal women. This conditionpresents after menopause and is presumed to be another of the postmenopausal effects ofestrogen withdrawal. Estrogen replacement therapy is a-possible treatment of this 6 disorder, but studies need to be coordinated between oral health care practitioners andgynecologists to explore this health problem.Discoid Lupus Erythematosus, and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus have oralpresentations and occur more frequently in women. Connective tissue disease can belimited and benign, or severe and systemic. Oral lesions can be the presenting feature ofthese disease. The oral lesions can by painful and may cause malnutrition in the seriouslyill patient. Although the loss of teeth in women has been attributed to alveolar osteoporosis, anothercause of tooth loss in women is periodontal disease.Periodontal disease occurs frequentlyin elderly women. Severe periodontal inflammation is a precursor of tooth loss. Non-institutionalized women visit dentists more frequently, suggesting that this periodontaldisease is not a product of neglect, but is another disease which affects elderly women.Fibrous Dysplasia,a disease of bone, occurs more frequently in women and may beexacerbated by pregnancy or estrogen therapy. Fibrous dysplasia of the jaw is seen anddiagnosed by oral health care practitioners.Dental implantsare more common in women, and more women are denied dentalimplants than men. In a study by Andersson et al, more women than men received singletooth implants. In addition, a larger proportion of women were rejected for dental implantplacement in this study than men. The reasons for rejection in this study were not defined,however, most dental implant devices have been tested in jaw locations which are definedby bone geometry. Women have smaller, thinner alveolar ridges which may not be suitablefor the devices being tested. (8).Oral canceris more common than cancer of the cervix or ovary. Oral cancer is associatedwith smoking or tobacco use. New patterns of smoking suggest that younger cohorts ofwomen will be at increased risk of contracting oral cancer as they become elderly women.Oral cancers have a poor prognosis, with a survival rate at five years of less than 50%.Oral cancers are disfiguring and can result in severe disabilities and malnutrition insurvivors.Oral Manifestations of Systemic DiseaseSometimes, oral symptoms are the prodrome of systemic disease. Below are someexamples of systemic diseases which oral health care practitioners recognize and treat orrefer.Anemiascan be caused by vitamin B deficiency and by iron deficiency. These vitamindeficiencies are associated with painful oral symptoms. Multiple myeloma is a devastating plasma cell malignancy which may present as facialpain. 36 6 Paget 's disease of bone predominately affects the elderly. This progressive disease is characterized by bony deformities which may induce neuropathies by compressing nerves. Paget's disease may present with jaw pain or numbness.Diabetes mellitus may present with oral mucosal infections, altered taste sensation or complaints of dry or burning mouth. In a study of patients with these symptoms, thefrequency of non-insulin dependent diabetes was twice that expected in the general population. (9).Connective tissue diseases which affect women in greater proportion include Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and temporal arteritis .These disease have oral and orofacial symptoms andmay present to either an oral health care practitioner or to a general health care practitioner.The Traditions of the Oral Health Practitioner Include Prevention and ScreeningOral health practitioners and their Allied Health Professionals have a tradition ofproviding effective Preventive Health Care. A visit to the dentist usuallyencompasses a mixture of education, prevention and treatment. Eighty percent of general practitioners are trained to take a comprehensive medical and oral history, blood pressure and any other diagnostic tests which are required for risk assessment prior to the surgical treatments of health care. Preventive counseling highlights caries and periodontal care. However, dental care practitioners also include information on smoking and tobacco cessation (oral cancer risk), and nutrition counseling (caries, alveolar bone loss, anorexia-bulemia-related tootherosion). In older or more medically compromised populations, dentists are competent to take blood pressures and recommend a physician followup for hypertension control. Withthe AIDS epidemic, oral manifestations of AIDS in severely immunocompromisedmedically complex patientsare being treated by oral health care practitioners. In hospitals,dentists are an integral part of the transplant team for heart, lung, liver and kidneytransplant patients. The oral health care practitioner sees patients when they are well;before the subclinical illness becomes clinically evident and forces the patient to present to a physician. Thus, oral health care practitioners recognize systemic disease manifestations and encourage the patient to consult a physician, realizing an important benefit for the patient.Oral Health in the Medical CurriculumWhile there is considerable overlap in the knowledge base of physicians and oral health practitioners, there are also barriers in the education and training of health care practitioners and oral healthcare practitioners which limit the integration of oral healthcare and general health care. A recent survey and report of the medical school curriculum(10) sponsored by PHS, HRSA and ORWH, documented a requirement for instruction in oral health and in women's oral health concerns in only 35% of medical schools surveyed.A complimentary study of the dental school curriculum is in progress, and results will beforthcoming this fall, 1997. The gap in knowledge in oral health means that physicianswithout special trainingarc not informed about oral disease and are not knowledgeableabout the role of oral health practitioners in caring for their shared patients. As a physician 6'7 working at this interface of general health and oral health, I am often a practical linkbetween these two worlds. As an example, I would like to share a case with you whichillustrates the advantage of integrating oral health care and general health care.A Case Illustrating Integration of Health Care and Oral Health CareThe patient, Mrs. G. presented to a third year dental student in the Clinic of theSchool of Dental Medicine. The patient was a 60 year old female with extensiveperiodontal disease which had led to loss of several teeth. The patient had also beendiagnosed with Paget's disease of bone, a localized, benign bone condition which causesbone deformity in the affected bones. Mrs. G. told the dental student that she had been toseveral dental practitioners asking if she could have dental implants placed. Once herdiagnosis of Paget's disease was known, each dental practitioner had told her that dentalimplants were not possible and that dentures would also be a problem because she had abone disease. Finally, Mrs. G. ended up at the University Dental Clinic hoping thatsomeone could provide some solution for her tooth loss. The third year student had justfinished a research rotation in my laboratory and he knew that my area of clinical expertisewas in metabolic bone disease. He refereed the patient to me, asking if there were anycontraindications to dental implants or to dentures. The patient had a previous bone scanwhich did not show any Paget's disease in her maxilla, which was the area where her teethhad been lost. X-rays of the same area did not show any Paget's lesions in her maxilla. Iwas able to recommend that either dentures or dental implants could be provided for thispatient. A week later, the Oral Surgeon who was inserting the implants called and asked ifa bone graft from the pelvis could be used to build up the maxilla to house the dentalimplants. To this, I definitely replied \"no\", because the pelvic bones from which the graftwould be harvested showed evidence of Paget's disease. In theory, use of the pelvic graftmaterial might result in seeding of Paget's disease into the previously unaffected maxillarybone. A heterologous bone graft was used to build up the maxilla for Mrs. G. While thiscase did not involve a life and death decision for Mrs. G., her quality of life was seriouslyimpaired before there was an effective integration of her oral health care and generalhealth care. The integration in this case was only possible because I was in the oral healthcare setting, interacting with oral health practitioners. Often, the patient is not able tobenefit from this kind of integration. For example, in the university-based clinical setting,where I see patients with osteoporosis and metabolic bone disease, I have seenpostmenopausal women with oral symptoms of estrogen deficiency, dry mouth andburning mouth, who have not thought of consulting an oral health care practitioner abouttheir problem, and have been told repeatedly by physicians that they have never heard ofsuch symptoms associated with menopause. I cannot fault the physicians, because I was inthe same position as they before I started teaching in the oral health environment.Implementing ChangeThe barriers which divide oral health care and general health care for women are beingchallenged by two approaches. The survey and report of the medical curriculum and theongoing survey of the dental curriculum should lead to reevaluation of the gaps betweenthe training of health care and oral health care practitioners. One goal should includestructuring the respective curricula to provide linkages between the disciplines of medicineand dentistry. Curricula can be designed to decrease the knowledge gaps and to lower5 68 barriers to the practice of integrated care. As far as practice integration is concerned,integrated medical and dental services are now beginning to be offered in some managedcare settings. Working together on the same patients should help oral health and healthcare practitioners achieve better integration of oral health and health care for women.Recommendations for Oral Health and General Health Care for Postmenopausal and Elderly WomenI will close by recommending specific changes aimed at improving oral health care and the integration of oral health care with general health care. First, I am currentlyinvolved as an investigator in an AADS nation-wide survey of the dental curriculum. Theobject of the survey is to document the inclusion of women's health and oral health issuesin dental school curricula. This survey should provide findings complimentary to theWomen's Health in the Medical Curriculum: Report of a Survey and Recommendations(4) which was recently completed by the ORWH, PHS and HRSA. With the completion ofour survey, the gaps in women's health and oral health care education can besystematically addressed. As a general frame for closing these gaps and implementingspecific changes, I suggest the following three recommendations:Improve science transfer/education of the publicThe research community is continually improving the depth and applicability of scientificand medical knowledge, but only a very little of this substance is effectively transmitted tothe patient and the public. It is imperative that we impact on the education ofpractitioners. We should also transmit and translate our findings into the area ofcontinuing medical and dental education, and to the public.Strengthen the linkages between oral health and general healthMy second recommendation would be a plea for research into the feasibility of integratingoral health clinical problem solving into general medical care and involving oral health carepractitioners in the general health care setting. This recommendation is similar to theRecommendation 5 from the recent Institute of Medicine Report on Dental Education atthe Crossroads (11). Outcome analysis of the impact on clinical care should be followedfor both kinds of practitioners to further the effectiveness of this initiative. This translatesinto more clinical research to support these studies of integrated care. I would recommendthe series of short topics on Oral and Dental Problems in the Elderly edited by BruceBaum in Clinics in Geriatric Medicine as a prototype of this approach. Crosstalk betweenoral health care practitioners and general health care practitioners should also be fostered in a continuing education environment, or in symposia.Enhance research training opportunities for women as futureeducators/researchersThe NIDR Strategic Initiative II includes a specific goal to enhance training and careerdevelopment programs to attract and retain exceptional individuals in craniofacial, oral anddental research. A subgoal is to facilitate the participation of women, ethic and racialminorities and individuals with disabilities in research. The National Science Foundation 669 POWRE program is another program aimed at involving women as future educatorq andresearchers. These goals of inclusion of women as leaders in research and education arekey to the future of women's health.Thank you for this opportunity to give testimony. I will close by quoting Dr. C.Everett Coop, \"You're not healthy without oral health\". 770 References1.Redford, M, Beyond Pregnancy Gingivitis: bringing a new focus to women's oral health J.

I am a pediatric dentist and anassociate professor at the University of Pittsburgh, School of Dental Medicineand the Enid Neidle Scholar-in-Residence at the Division of Women andMinority Affairs at the American Association of Dental Schools (AADS). I ampleased to present this testimony to the Office of Research on Women's Health(ORWH) and commend your efforts to expand opportunities for women inbiomedical careers through the recruitment, reentry, retention, support, andadvancement of women scientists.The AADS represents all of the nation's 55 dental schools as well asadvanced education programs in dental schools and hospitals, and allied dentaleducation programs. It is in these institutions where future dental practitioners,educators, and researchers are trained; significant dental care provided; and themajority of dental research conducted. The AADS is the one nationalorganization that speaks exclusively on behalf of dental education. Identifyingand representing women's issues is a priority for the association.My remarks will focus on the needs of female dental researchers. I willfirst :discuss the difference between dental and medical education followedbywomen's presence in dental school programs, in postgraduate clinicaltraining and research training programs, and in faculty positions. 41 2 Finally, I will provide recommendations by the AADS to supportfemale dental scientists. Differences Between Dental and Medical EducationDistinct differences exist between dental and medical education, andthese differences have significant implications for the training of dentists.Unlike medicine, no requirement exists for a dental school graduate topursue postdoctoral or advanced education. Considering the rigorousdental school curriculum and accumulated debt of dental graduates(Average graduating debt was $75,748 in 1996.1)*, it is surprising thatdespite such debt nearly 60 percent of recent graduates enroll in someform of advanced dental education. Annually, approximately 1,500dentists begin a general dentist residency program and nearly an equalnumber begin clinical specialty programs.2If dentists elect to enroll in a research training program, they pursuethe program in a period equivalent to a medical residency. This is incontrast to physicians whose research training is a post-residencyendeavor. Before the National Research Service Award (NRSA)program, postgraduate training centered around clinical specialtytraining. Legislation that limits NRSA training to three years ofpostdoctoral research experience is a significant problem for oral *Updated figure for 1997 -- $81,688Survey of Dental School Seniors 1997 Graduating Class. 1998 American Associationof Dental Schools. 3 health research (OHR) scientists. A dentist awarded a training grantseeking a Ph.D. requires more than three years, especially whenconcomitant clinical training is involved. Recruitment could beincreased if the legislated limit were removed.Additionally, dentists have a disincentive to pursue training as clinicalinvestigators. Whereas, the physician receives a salary and benefits asa hospital resident and subspecialty fellow, the dentist's similarpayment is limited largely to hospital-based training programs in oralsurgery or oral pathology. Training in other specialty areas rarelyoffers compensation and may even require tuition payment.Finally, even though the National Institutes of Health (NIH) comprisesthe largest single source of support for postdoctoral research trainingof physicians, a variety of private foundations, agencies, andcorporate-related organizations fund the training of physician-scientists. However, the National Institute of Dental Research(NIDR) is the only funding source through its NRSA programs andDentist-Scientist Awards that support oral health research ortraining specifically for oral health research. Continued support oftraining through NIDR is essential to continued improvement of oralhealth research scientists. 7 13 4 Women's Presence in DentistryHistorically, women have been substantially under-represented in thefield of dentistry. In 1982, of all of the professionally active dentists, only threepercent were women.3 By 1995, the percentage rose to 12 percent.3 A criticalneed for aggressive efforts to increase the number of women in dentistry exists.United States dental schools are working to increase the number of womenentering the dental profession. Female enrollment at dental schools continues togrow with the total number of women exceeding 36 percent in 1996.4 However,women are still a minority on almost every dental campus.An increase in female enrollment in advanced dental programs is alsooccurring. Women accounted for 30 percent (1,433 women) of all the dentists inpostgraduate training programs.2 This increasing proportion of female dentalpostdoctoral students may make it possible for women to acquire a larger shareof the faculty positions at US dental schools.The dilemma of underrepresentation is particularly severe among dentalschool faculty and administrators. Presently, no woman is the dean of a dentalschool in any of our 55 institutions. And historically, only one woman has everheld such a position. Only six percent of the department chairs are women.sFrom personal experience, this figure is often inflated. 77 5 Exact comparisons of data with other professions are not alwaysconsistent because data-reporting methods vary. Nevertheless, overall trendscan be seen by the following statistics:Of the 178 law schools, 28 percent of the faculty are women, as are 40percent of the associate professors and 17 percent of the fullprofessors.6In medicine, 20 percent of the associate professors and 10 percent ofthe full professors are women.6At the 55 US dental schools, 15 percent of the associate professors andfive percent of the full professors are women.6 With regard to femalefaculty, dental schools are clearly lagging behind other professionalinstitutions.A database on dental educators compiled by the AADS provides the bestavailable information on the oral health research labor force. This databaseincludes all faculty appointments to US dental educational institutions and isupdated annually. It includes information on age, gender, race, academic rank,appointment status (full or part-time), academic degrees held, and area ofprimary appointment. Analysis of this database showed that the average age oforal health research scientists increased from 47.3 to 49.1 years of age from 1986to 1992.7 During this same time, the percentage of these scientists who identifiedtheir primary appointments as clinical sciences decreased from 44 percent to 36 78 6 percent (comparative figure for all full-time faculty is 58 percent).? Finally, theportion of these scientists who entered and left was more than one-third of thetotal. These analyses indicate that oral health research scientists are a somewhataging group who leave dental education and contribute to an acute shortage ofdental educators and oral health researchers.The most recent data for fiscal year 1993 (1992 for trainees) indicate that,overall, the success rate for competing research project grants (R01 and FIRSTawards) has been declining. The success rate for both women and men was 18percent, although for renewal applications it was 40.2 percent for men and 38.4percent for women.8 In fiscal year 1993, 16.4 percent of research grant dollarswent to women, compared with 10.2 percent in 1984.8 However, total dollaramounts of competing and non-competing grant awards to women aresignificantly less than those for men. Of particular concern to the AADS is thefact that the success rate for competing research projects is lowest for womenat the NIDR as compared with all other institutes at the NIH.Success rates for funded grants are higher among scientists with a dentaldegree and a Ph.D. Therefore, special initiatives are needed to allow women toenter these research training opportunities so they can approach the level of theirmale counterparts. An alarming shortage of research-trained, full-time femaledental faculty exists at our dental schools. To alleviate these shortages,enhanced resources and cooperation and collaboration between institutions and 79 7 need to occur if we are to improve the oral health of the American people asmandated by Congress for the twenty first century. RecommendationsTo meet current and anticipated needs form qualified female dentalresearchers in academic dentistry, our organization recommends the following:Stimulate interest in dental careers among young women throughspecific outreach programs, starting in the elementary school yearswith increasing emphasis through high school and college.Establish research mentoring programs in magnet high schools for femalestudents to be linked with university researchers.Expand the clinical research fellowship program to train womendentists to research expertise level to investigate clinical areas such asepidemiology, behavioral medicine, and health services research. TheNIH study sections are so focused on basic sciences that a new sectionneeds to be formed that would focus on clinical areas of oral healthresearch.Increase the number of positions in the five year Dentist-ScientistAward program and the NRSA training and fellowship programs toaccommodate the increasing pool of women dental school graduatesinterested in research careers.Expand mentoring program along with short-term experiences to assure todevelop long-term interest and contact with potential oral health researchers. BO 8 Increase the number of positions in the five year Dentist-ScientistAward program and the NRSA training and fellowship programs toaccommodate the increasing pool of women dental school graduatesinterested in research careers.Expand short-term research experiences (T-35 mechanism) to attractfemale dental students into research careers. Explore whether thismechanism can be extended to retraining and/or re-entry. Currently,this mechanism is limited to four percent of NRSA funds.Develop research grants for other advanced dental educationprograms such as pediatric dentistry, periodontology, orthodontics, orany of the other specialties (Most grants cover oral and maxillofacialsurgery and oral pathology positions.). This should establish andstrengthen research training capabilities in all of the specialty areas.Provide supplemental research opportunities at a critical career stage(for example, a career interruption to accommodate familyresponsibilities or relocation requirements). These supplements wouldbe designed to support women dental scientists who haddemonstrated excellent research potential, but interrupted their careersfor family care responsibilities. Such grants would allow re-entrycandidates to update their skills and advance toward becomingindependent investigators.

This concern resulted in a mandate to federalagencies to collaborate with the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)and others on a study to determine the extent to which women's health is addressed inthe medical school curriculum.The results of the medical school curriculum survey were included in a 1996 report:Women's Health in the Medical School Curriculum: Report of a Survey andRecommendations. The survey findings showed that women's oral health is taught as arequired course in only 9% of medical schools and not offered in 69%. The AADScontributed to this project by writing a short section on women's oral health anddrafting several questions for the medical curriculum survey.A comparable survey of women's health issues has not been conducted in dentaleducation. The AADS acknowledges the importance of educating dentists about thehealth and healthcare of both men and women. In view of the high level of interestrelated to women's health, the AADS is undertaking the responsibility for conductingthe required survey to collect dental school data. There is very little information onhow women's oral health is addressed in dental school curricula. We view this as anopportunity to document the state of dental school curricula relative to women'shealth.The enclosed questionnaire is patterned after the Association of American MedicalCollege's medical curriculum survey to allow comparison between medical and dentalcurricula. Collected information will be aggregated to maintain individualconfidentiality. The aggregated data will be unrestricted.Drs. Lisa Tedesco and Marita Inglehart (University of Michigan) and Dr. SusanSilverton (University of Pennsylvania) will work with AADS Staff in the data analysisand reporting. 103 Your participation is critical to the success of this information-gathering effort and toassure that the report reflects correct information. We expect to have this surveycompleted in time to be reported in June, 1998 and for use in ensuring that women'shealth is appropriately addressed in dental education.Please have the individual who is responsible for this aspect of your curriculumcomplete this survey.

Researchareas that highlight issues of special interest to women include thestudy of periodontal disease and its role in the birth of premature, lowbirth weight infants; gender differences in response to certain painmedications; methods for regenerating bone weakened by osteoporosis; andan anti-HIV protein in human saliva.Researchers, who are part of a recently established consortia to promotethe study of minority oral health problems and offer research trainingto minority researchers, have demonstrated a preliminary link betweenperiodontal disease and the delivery of preterm, low birth weight (PLBW)infants.The research team worked with pregnant women attending a high-risk obstetrical clinic where the incidence of periodontal disease wasquite high.Periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition caused bybacteria that affects the gums. Eventually, tooth-supporting bone isdamaged and teeth are lost. Recent epidemiological studies have shownthat fifty-five percent of females between the ages of 20-24 years ofage have periodontal disease. Within the small research population ofpregnant women, the investigators found that women who had evidence ofperiodontal disease were 7.5 times more likely to deliver PLBW babies.Thirty-three percent of the study population were black and 67 percentwere white; however, of the PLBW mothers, 45 percent were black and 55percent were white. In an attempt to establish a definitive linkbetween periodontal disease and PLBW, the NIDR is planning a follow-up-study of 2500 patients where other obstetric risk factors, such astobacco exposure, substance abuse and presence of vagina] pathogens aremeasured.NIDR investigators have been active contributors to pain research. Thisyear, interest in the diverse nature of pain research lead the Director,NIH, toestablish the NIH Pain Research Consortium co-directed by theNIDR Director, Dr. Harold Slavkin and Dr. Zach Hall, Director of theNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The Consortiumwill promote information exchange and collaboration among the NIHinstitutes, beginning with a major conference planned for the Fall of1997.Recent discoveries in the field of pain research are beginning tohighlight the differences between men and women. For example, NIDR-supported research has shown that hormone replacement therapy in womenmay be associated with referral for treatment of temporomandibulardisorders.In addition, investigators have recently discovered evidencethat women may experience pain relief differently than men. A class ofdrugs, kappa-opioids, that until now have been considered less effectivethan mu-opioids, such as morphine, codeine and methadone, have beenshown by these investigators to be highly effective in women. This wasnot discovered earlier because kappa-opioids were studied primarily in108 men and male rats where the analgesic effect is weak. This discovery provides impetus for pain researchers to study the putative differencesbetween men's and women's pain mechanisms and search for safe andeffective medication with an eye to gender.NIDR intramural scientists, who are responsible for the design ofprocedures that allow for the isolation and study of bone-formingosteoblasts, are now using these techniques to harvest osteoblastprecursors called marrow stromal fibroblasts (MSFs) from normal humanvolunteers and growing them in vitro. When the MSFs are implanted inimmunosuppressed mice, they grow new bone. 'In the latest development,these researchers have succeeded in devising a methodology that allowsfor the consistent, in vivo generation of extensive bone from human MSFs in a mouse model. Under special conditions, bone and blood-formingmarrow were generated throughout an implant within 48 hours. This lineof research, when refined, could lead directly to methods to regeneratebone weakened by osteoporosis throughout the skeleton.Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the resulting Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has spread to all segments of the population.' Overtwenty-one million people are living with HIV/AIDS worldwide; forty-twopercent of them are women, and this population is growing. In 1995, NIDR intramural scientists identified a salivary gland cells in vitro. While there was no evidence ofviral reproduction in the saliva-producing acinar cells where SLPI issecreted, there was viral activity in the lymphocytes found in theconnective tissues surrounding the gland where there is no SLPI.This finding helps explain why HIV does not appear to be spread by salivaeven though the virus was identified in thirty percent of the salivary glands examined. NIDR researchers now are investigating the role andpresence of SLPI in other excretions, such as breast milk. 109 WOMEN'S HEALTH RESEARCHFY 1995-1996NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL RESEARCH The mission of the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR) is toimprove and promote craniofacial, oral and dental health. To furtherour mission we support research and training in normal development aswell as in diseases and disorders that affect the tissues in and aroundthe craniofacial-oral-dental complex.The scope of NIDR research thusincludes development and molecular biology and inherited disease; oralcancers; infectious diseases (including AIDS); and chronic and disablingdisorders, such as bone and joint diseases and neurological andneurosensory disorders, with particular emphasis on chronic pain. Ourcommitment to the fundamental study of the body's hard tissues--teeth,cartilage and bone--has led to advances in biomaterials research and tothe emerging fields of tissue engineering and \"biomimetics\"--whichexploit the body's own cellular and molecular processes to repair andregenerate tissues and organs. Recognizing that disease occurs in thecontext of personal behaviors and environmental factors, the Institutehas long emphasized the importance of behavioral, social science andepidemiological research. Accomplishments that affect women inparticular are to be found within many of these broad researchcategories.AccomplishmentsOral Health ResearchPeriodontal Disease and Premature, Low Birth Weight Infants. NIDRsupports four research consortia -- Regional. Research Centers in MinorityOral Health (RRCMOH)--designed to link research-intensive institutionswith institutions that serve large minority populations and/or thattrain students who are predominantly drawn from racial or ethnicminority populations. These consortia provide opportunities forresearch on minority oral health problems and research training forminority students. In addition, funding from the National Center forResearch Resources is providing support for research facultydevelopment.One such consortia--Meharry Medical College/University ofAlabama at Birmingham School of Dentistry--is collaborating with theUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This team of researchers,working with women attending a high-risk obstetrical clinic,demonstrated a preliminary link between the many cases of periodontaldisease in the clinic and premature, low birth weight (PLBW) infants.Periodontal disease is a bacterial infection of the gums that causespainful inflammation and eventual loss of tooth-supporting bone.Recentepidemiological studies indicate that fifty-five percent of femalesbetween the ages of 20-24 years of age have periodontal disease.TheRRCMOH study included 124 women (33 percent black, 67 percent white) whowere pregnant or had recently delivered. The investigators found thatwomen who had periodontal disease were 7.5 times more likely to havePLBW babies than women without the disease (within the PLBW mothers, 45percent were black and 55 percent were white). while the study found astatistically significant association between periodontal disease and110 PLBW in this small population, it does not necessarily mean that guminfections cause premature births. NIDR is planning a follow-up studyon more than 2500 patients to determine whether the association withperiodontitis persists when more extensive measures of periodontaldisease and oral pathogens are analyzed in the context of otherobstetric risk factors, e.g., smoke exposure, substance abuse, vaginalpathogens, sociobehavioral and demographic data.pain ResearchNIDR has had a long-standing interest in pain research dating back to1977 when the first training grant for clinical research on chronic painwas awarded.In 1983, the Institute established a multi-disciplinaryPain Research Clinic in the NIH Clinical Center where today a variety ofpain conditions (acute and chronic) are studied. The Institute'sinterest in pain continues to grow and broaden as is exemplified in thelist of initiatives and conferences/workshops listed below and in itsgrowing portfolio. Pain issues of special interest to women arecurrently commanding more attention. Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)and how women experience pain differently than men are two areas ofstudy supported by the NIDR.Tran-NIH Pain Research Consortium. Given the NIDR's growing painportfolio and that of other NIH institutes, the NIH Director, Dr. HaroldVarmus, established a trans-NIH Pain Research Consortium. TheConsortium will encourage information sharing and collaborative researchefforts, provide coordination of pain research across all NIH componentsand ensure that the results of NIH-supported pain research are widelycommunicated.It also will seek opinions and advice both from otherFederal agencies involved in studies of pain and from non-Governmentorganizations interested in pain research. The NIDR Director, Dr.Harold Slavkin, will co-chair the initiative along with Dr. Zach Hall,Director, MINDS. The Consortium will sponsor a conference in the Fallof 1997 at which time the TMDs will be addressed along with issues ofgender and pain.Gender and Pain. Researchers studying response to analgesicsfollowing wisdom tooth extractions recently reported that kappa-opioidsproduced potent post-surgical pain relief in female patients, but wereof negligible benefit for male patients. Kappa-opioids, as a class ofdrugs, had been considered much less effective than mu-opioids, such asmorphine, codeine and methadone, based on earlier studies. In recentstudies, however, that ineffectiveness can be attributed to the factthat the kappa-opioids were studied primarily in men and male rats wherethe analgesic effect is weak. This phenomenon provides impetus for painresearchers to identify differences in male/female pain mechanisms andto address their search for safe effective analgesic drugs with an eyeto gender.Temporomandibular Disorders (TMDs). Temporomandibular disordersare chronic conditions of the jaw joint and surrounding musculature thatlead to dysfunction and chronic pain. Chronic facial pain affects over10 million adults; of these, nearly 7 million have pain mainly centeredon the masticatory muscles and/or TM joint. Women report these symptoms 2.6 times more frequently than do men. While pain and dysfunction areoverwhelmingly the presenting symptoms, the, Institute is addressing allaspects.of these disorders, including investigations of the etiology andpathogenesis.Since basic knowledge about the etiology and pathogenesisof these conditions is meager, research projects are being focused onall possible avenues of discovery: musculoskeletal, biomechanical,,endocrine, immune, neurological and behavioral. Such studies can leadto a clearer understanding of underlying mechanisms that promote andsustain these chronic conditions and make it possible in the future forresearchers to intervene early to prevent or ameliorate these maladies.Until then, the Institute recommends reversible, non-invasive treatmentswhenever possible. Accomplishments resulting from NIDR-funded TMDresearch in FY1995-1996 reflect the various approaches being undertakento studying these disorders.Estrogen and the TMDs. Two NIDR-sUpported.epidemiological studieswere conducted to determine whether use of exogenous hormones (oralcontraceptives and hormone replaceMent therapy) are associated with anincreased probability of referial for treatment of TMDs. Theinvestigators analyzed ten ye'ars of automated pharmacy and health sate'records available through a large HMO. Referral for TMD treatment wasfound to be 77 percent more likely among patients who had receivedestrogen replacement as compared with those who had not. Moreover, aclear dose-response relationshipemerged,.with the probability ofreferral for TMD treatment increasing consistently across subgroupsexposed to higher dose levels of estrogen. Patients with cumulativeyearly estrogen doses in excess of 220 mg were referred for TMDtreatment at a rate almost double that of controls. While thesefindings suggest a positive statistical association betWeen exposure toexogenous female hormones and the occurrence of symptoms of TMDs thatprompt referral for diagnosis/treatment, this correlation cannot andshould not be interpreted to suggest cause - effect relationships untilfurther, more extensive research is conducted.Markers of TMD Pathogenesis. In one study comparing women whohave anatomical signs of TM joint disc displacement, investigators foundthat those who were currently experiencing pain had significantly higherlevels of a marker substance called bradykinin in their joint fluid, incontrast to women who were asymptomatic. Other studies have foundevidence of joint cartilage breakdown in the fluid that is reliablyassociated with arthritic changes. Arthritis is just one of thepossible causes of pain and malfunction of the TM joint. These andother studies focused on the musculature of the jaw will help establishthe exact pathology giving rise to these conditions.none ResearchThe study of bone and other mineralized tissues are among the oldestbasic research fields of interest at the NIDR, dating back to 1945 withthe Institute's inception. Bone is a dynamic tissue that changescontinually throughout life. In healthy bone, a delicate balance betweenbone formation (promoted by osteoblasts) and resorption (promoted byosteoblasts) is maintained. In aging bone, that balance often shifts,leaving the bone brittle and subject to fracture. Oral bone can be 112 affected as well, leaving the mandible and maxilla less able to supportteeth, especially during periodontal infection.In the early 1980s, NIDR intramural scientists designed procedures toisolate and study the bone-forming osteoblasts, making it easier forscientists around the world to conduct basic studies on bone formation.For example, using these techniques, investigators at the Mayo Clinicwere able to show that human bone cells have estrogen receptors. Thesefindings have led to further studies that refine our knowledge about thedevelopment of osteoporosis.Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease characterized by loss of bone mass,architectural deterioration and an increased risk of fracture. As amajor public health problem, osteoporosis affects an estimated 20million older Americans in a female to male ratio of 4:1. Approximately1.5 million cases of osteoporosis-related fractures are reportedannually.In 1995, health care expenditures attributable toosteoporotic fractures were estimated at $13.8 billion, of which $10:3billion (75.1%) was for the treatment of white women, $2.5 billion (18%)for vihiteMen, of New Bone for Osteoporotic Fracture. The same NIDRintramural scientists who designed the unique procedure to studyosteoblasts are engineering the growth of new bone in damaged tissues,such as that experienced with degenerative diseases like osteoporosis.In 1995, these investigators initiated their first protocol in the newlyestablished NIDR Bone Clinic in the NIH Clinical Center. There theyhave designed a method for harvesting bone marrow cells called marrowstromal fibroblasts (MSFs)from normal human volunteers and growing themin vitro.These studies are based on earlier findings that MSFs havethe potential to develop into bone-forming osteoblasts. In fact, whenthe MSFs were implanted in immunosuppressed mice, they grew new bone..In the latest development, these researchers have succeeded in devisinga methodology that allows for the consistent, in vivo generation ofextensive bone from human MSFs in a mouse model. Under specialconditions, bone and blood-forming marrow were generated throughout animplant within 48 days. This line of research, when refined, could leaddirectly to methods to regenerate bone throughout the skeleton.Estrogen's Influence on Jaw Bone. NIDR-supported investigatorshave demonstrated that ovariectomized sheep (sheep whose ovaries havebeen removed) show significantly greater evidence of jaw bonedegeneration, as measured by the depth of space between the gums and theteeth, than do sheep with their ovaries intact. Sheep with decreasedestrogen levels due to ovariectomy also showed increased serumbiomarkers for osteoporosis. Sheep provide a particularly appropriateanimal model for studies of hormonal influences on bone because theirmetabolic rate and bone size are comparable to that of humans. Inaddition, normal adult female sheep have numerous estrous cyclesthroughout the year, and they experience skeletal and oral bone problemsassociated with aging. 113 Hormone Replacement Therapy and Jaw Bone. In another relatedstudy, investigators demonstrated the relationship between estrogenstatus in postmenopausal women and jaw bone density changes over a one-year period.Women, postmenopausal by no more than seven years, weredivided into two groups: those taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT)and those whO,were not. Computer-assisted image analyses performed ontheir dental x -rays found that over the one year interval studied, womenon HRT displayed a mean net gain in alveolar (jaw) bone density, whileestrogen deficient women experienced a significant loss. Tooth loss, Osteoporosis and Smoking. NIDR extramural scientistshave found a significant relationship between the loss of periodontalbone and years since menopause, especially in women who smoke. Thus, itis likely that systemic bone loss may negatively effect tooth retentionthrough an estrogen-mediated mechanism.Oral Bone Loss and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). In 1996,NIDR initiated a study to evaluate oral bone loss compared to systemicbone loss and hormonal status in the, 1,300.podtmenopausal women expectedtthenroll.in the observational arm cd.the.Bliffalo area'sWomen's. Health Initiative (WHI) study. .Preliminary studies by theseinvestigators had showed gender differences in the incidence andprevalence of oral tissue changes associated with smoking, which isknown to be a risk factor for periodontal disease. The hypothesis beingtested is whether estrogen levels contribute to these differences.These studies may help generate information directly applicable toimproving prevention and early detection of periodontal disease andosteoporosis in middle aged and older women.Breast Cancer Cell Metastasis To Bone. In collaboration withcolleagues in Belgium, intramural scientists have determined that bonesialoprotein (BSP), a bone matrix protein generally limited to normalmineralized tissues, such as bones and teeth, also is found in theradio-opaque mineralized nodules commonly detected in the mammograms ofbreast cancer patients. These findings led to a series of experimentsthat show that breast cancer cells with a propensity to metastasize tobone express significant levels of BSP. The hypothesis that BSP may bean osteotrophic agent is currently being tested. Based on thesestudies, the investigators also report that certain peptides (moleculesthat link together to form proteins), derived from the region of BSPthat contains a cell attachment sequence, were effective in blockingbreast cancer cell attachment to bone. Using this finding, researchersmay be able to modulate breast cancer cell attachment to bone in thefuture.gstroaen ResearchEndothelial Cells in Blood Vessels Have Estrogen ReceptorsEstrogen's influence is felt throughout the body.As discussed above,estrogen may play a role in the pathophysiology of the TMDs and in boneformation.NIDR intramural scientists have shown that estrogen promotesthe attachment, migration, proliferation, differentiation and depositionof new blood vessels (angeogenesis). These same scientists have nowdemonstrated that the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels have114 functional estrogen receptors. These finding demonstrate the important role of estrogenin tumor growth, which depends on new blood vessel growth.In addition, estrogen increases the reactivity of endothelial cells to immune cells, which could explain why 'preMenopausal women suffer more inflammatory diseases, such as rheuMatoid arthritis,Takayasu's arthritis, lupuS'ekythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome then do men.Salivary Research NIDR conducts and supports both basic and clinical research on salivary function and dysfunction. Xerostomia (dry mouth); a condition resultingfrom the destruction of salivary glands is studied in the NIDR-operatedDry Mouth Clinic as well as in several extramural academic health centers.Salivary gland malfunction may be caused by radiation therapyand chemotherapy for head and neck cancers and by diseases, such as Sjagren's syndrome. Sjogren's syndrome and Salivary Function. SjOgren's syndrome is an inflammatory, autoimmuneldisease that causes salivary and tear duct gland destruction. Ninety percent of cases are found in women.Lack of saliva can lead to rampant tooth decay, tooth loss, and oral sores. In addition, when the mouth is dry, it is difficult to speak and swallow. The drugs being tested for conditions such as Sjogrenss syndrome includethose that stimulate salivary gland secretion and drugs that treat theunderlying chronic inflammation. Working with a pharmaceutical company, NIDR intramural scientists were involved with the conduct of a clinical trial that provided the data necessary to apply for FDA approval of thesaliva-promoting drug pilocarpine in 1995. It is the first and only drug approved by the FDA for xerostomia and salivary hypofunction in the US.AIDS Research NIH began studying Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)when it was first recognized in 1981 as a disease that weakened the immune systemsof its victims and left them open to a myriad of opportunistic diseases.The NIDR focus began in 1983 when intramural scientists identified an unhealthy immune cell they were able to associate.with the new and frightening syndrome. A retrovirus, immunodeficiency virus (HIV), was officially declared the causative agent in 1984.By 1985, NIDR was supporting a growing portfolio of intramural and extramural AIDS/HIV- related projects. Over the years since then, HIV has spread to all segments of the population, with an estimated 21.8 million people worldwide currently living with HIV/AIDS, 42 percent of whom are women, and this population is growing. Through 1996, approximately 5 million adults and 1.4 million children have died of AIDS-associated illnesses worldwide. In addition, an estimated 5 to 10 million children will 'beorphaned worldwide by the year 2,000 because of the premature deaths oftheir HIV-infected parents. In 1995, among women diagnosed with AIDS in the US,(76 percent) acquired HIV infection through injection drug use or through sexual contact with an infected man. Minorities aredisproportionately affected by AIDS in the US.In 1995, blacks and Hispanics represented the majority of cases.among men (54 percent) and115 among women (76 percent). Women, especially minority women, and theirchildren are clearly in growing jeopardy from this disease. Anti-HIV Factor in Saliva and Breast Milk. In 1995 NIDRintramural investigators identified a protein in human saliva--secretoryleukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI)--that blocks HIV infection of humansalivary gland cells in vitro. While there was no evidence of viralreproduction in the saliva-producing acinar cells where SLPI issecreted, there was viral activity in the lymphocytes found in theconnective tissues surrounding the gland where there is no SLPI.Thisfinding may help explain why HIV does not appear to be spread by salivaeven though the virus was identified in 30 percent of the salivaryglands examined. These same investigators have discovered that, whilebreast milk does not provide adequate levels of SLPI to confer antiviralprotection, colostrum does. However, this maternal source of protectionis transient and of insufficient duration to maintain protection against,mucosal transmissions of the virus over time.Natural History of HIV in Women and Minorities. Comparativestudies of HIV infections in different groups have been a focus of NIDRHIV/AIDS studies since the beginning of the epidemic. As the profile ofnew patients shifted from a predominantly male homosexual population toincreasing numbers of women and minorities, it becomes even moreimportant to ensure that our epidemiological and clinical researchstudies include them. An NIDR-supported project in San Francisco, nowin its tenth year, continues to track the oral manifestations of HIVinfection, and, due to the increasing numbers of women and minoritiesliving with HIV/AIDS, has increased their focus on both of thesepopulations.Their clinical studies will gather data on therelationship between oral lesions and the changing profile of HIV-infection; the association between oral lesions and CD4 count (crucialimmune cells that are disabled and killed during the typical course ofinfection); the prognostic significance of oral lesions for thedevelopment of AIDS; and whether behaviors, such as sexual practices anddrug use, or specific HIV treatments, increase or decrease thedevelopment of oral lesions.women's Interagency HIV Study. The Women's Interagency HIV Study(wIHS) is a collaborative, multi-site, longitudinal study of HIV diseaseprogression in women. NIDR supports oral health components at five WIHSsites across the country that will comprehensively study the oralmanifestations of HIV infection among women. Additionally, this is thefirst study to compare oral lesions with viral load in peripheral bloodand the only cohort to look at the effect of new anti-retroviraltherapies on the oral manifestations of HIV infection.WINS sites withoral components include Georgetown University; Bronx Lebanon Hospital;University of Southern California; University of California, SanFrancisco and Cook County Hospital, Chicago.HIV in the Oral Cavity, Peripheral Blood and vaginocervicalSecretions.\"DATRI 009\" is an NIAID-funded cross-sectional study thatuses the WIHS population to compare the amount of HIV (\"viral load\")found in the peripheral blood of HIV-infected women with from vaginocervical secretions. DATRI 009b is an NIDR-funded11.6 substudy to extend the comparative evaluations to the, oral cavity. The study's specific objectives are to (1) correlate the women's clinical status with the amount of virus in the oral cavity/saliva, peripheral blood and vaginocervical secretions; (2) determine whether systemic andlocal immunoglobulins influence the quantity and type of virus isolatedfrom the oral cavity/saliva; and (3) assess whether specific infectious agents, such as Candida albicans (a common mucosal fungus that becomesan infection during periods of immunosupression), herpes virus, chlamydia, and Epstein-Barr virus, influence the amount and type ofvirus isolated from the oral cavity/saliva. The investigators will also be determining whether anti-viral factors, such as SLPI, influence theamount and type of virus isolated from the oral cavity/saliva and what the effect of anti-viral therapies may have on the ability to detect HIV in the oral cavity.Initiatives NIDR intramural scientists proposed an Inter-Institute NIH Bone Clinic in 1995. The National Oral Health Information Clearinghouse (NOHIC) continuesto inform the public and professionals about the TMDs.NOHIC had distributed 12,500 TMD information packets and 81,600 copies, of the patient education brochures as of January 1997.A 1995 RFA on the Etiology and Pathogenesis of TemporomandibularDisorders resulted in thirty-six applications, ten of which werefunded (nine by NIDR, six with ORWH co-funding and one by ORWH alone) . On April 28, 1995, the NIDR joined nine institutes of the NIH and the Office of Alternative Medicine in a program announcement (PA)inBiobehavioral Pain Research to stimulate and foster a wide range of basic and clinical studies on pain as they relate to the missions of the various institutes. The NIH Director established the NIH Pain Research Consortium andnamed Drs. Harold Slavkin (NIDR) and Zach Hall (NINDS) as Co-chairs in 1996. NIDR intramural scientists initiated the trans-NIH Pain InterestGroup and establish an appropriate LISTSERV in 1996.Following up on reports identifying hormonal influences on pain andprofound gender-associated differences in response to kappa opioids, NIDR and NINR staff spearheaded an effort to expand extramuralresearch on gender-related differences in pain modulatory systems and analgesic response. A preliminary draft for an RFA on these topicswas prepared in 1996. It generated commitments of support from NCI, NINR, NIDA AND NIDR. Issuance of this RFA is anticipated in 1997. 117 Conferences and WorkshopsOn December 4-5, 1995, the Interagency Chronic Pain Task Force, withNIDR as lead institute, sponsored a Workihop on Selected Chronic PainConditiondl Clinical Spectrum, Frequency & Costs. The InteragencyTask Force was comprised of nine NIH institutes--NIDR, NIDA, NICHD,NINDS, NIAMS, NINR, NCI, NIMH and NIDDK--and HealthCare Policy and Research (AHCPR)and the ORWH.On April 29-May 1, 1996 the NIDR and the NIH Office of MedicalApplications of Research sponsored a Technology Assessment Conferenceon Management of Temporomandibular Disorders. Co-sponsors includedthe NIAMS, .NINDS, the ORWH. September 24-26, 1996, the NIDR sponsored a Workshop onBiomimetics, Tissue Engineering and Biomaterials, bringing togethercross-disciplinary researcher to help shape a research program forNIDR in these areas. Biomimetics refers to molecular approach torepair and regeneration of biological tissues, such as that neededfor TM joints that have experienced failed implants. On November 7-10, 1996, the NIDR sponsored a conference on SalivaryGland Biogenesis & Function along with the Sjogren's SyndromeFoundation and industry. The mission of the conference was toidentify diverse biological systems that influence salivary functionand explore opportunities for cross-disciplinary research. 118 APPENDIX M 119 On average, most of the clock hours for clinical science are spent on operative dentistry, commanding687.0 hours across all years of dental school education (Figure 4). Other involved subjects include fixedprosthodontics (467.8 hours), removable prosthodontics (438.7 hours), and \"Other\" subjects (320.9hours). The least number of clock hours is spent on clinical nutrition, for 15.2 hours across four years.Figure 4Average Number of Clock Hours in Clinical Science by Pain ControlClinical Survey Center, 198540 Survey of Predoctoral Dental Educational Institutions. Table 8 lists by school the number of clock hours by subject within clinical science. There is variationbetween the schools in the number of clock hours offered. Operative Dentistry, for example, averaged at687.0 hours, but individual schools ranged from 325 hours to 1294 hours. The number of hours spent onclinical nutrition varied from one hour to 65 hours. 120 APPENDIX N 121 ACCREDITATION STANDARDS FOR DENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS JANUARY 1998 COMMISSION ON DENTAL ACCREDITATION211 East Chicago AvenueChicago, Illinois 60611 122 TABLE OF CONTENTS INTRODUCTIONDEFINITION OF TERMS USED IN ACCREDITATION STANDARDS STANDARDPAGE i HI EFFECTIVENESS Professionalism 2Information Management and Critical Thinking 3Clinical Sciences 33.FACULTY AND STAFF 34.EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT SERVICESFacilities and Resources 4Student Services 4Student Financial Aid 4Health Services 45.PATIENT CARE SERVICES 56.RESEARCH PROGRAM 5 123 IntroductionMission Statement of the Commission on Dental AccreditationThe Commission on Dental Accreditation's mission is to ensure the quality of dentaland dental-related education by conducting accreditation reviews to determine thedegree to which individual programs meet the Commission's published accreditationstandards and their own stated goals and objectives. The Commission recognizesonly those programs meeting the accreditation standards that are developed andagreed upon by the various communities of interest, including the public. TheCommission's second purpose is to enhance and encourage improvement in thequality of its accredited educational programs.The Commission's accreditation program ensures that quality education is availablefor dentists, dental specialists and allied dental personnel. Quality educationultimately leads to quality dental care for the public.Thus, the Commission's voluntary accreditation program serves to ensureeducational quality and to improve the quality of the educational programs in 14dental and dental-related disciplines. These disciplines include: dentistry, dentalassisting, dental hygiene, dental laboratory technology, dental public health,endodontics, oral pathology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthodontics, pediatricdentistry, periodontics, prosthodontics, general practice residency and advancedgeneral dentistry.12/89In addition to the emphasis on quality education, the Accreditation Standards for Dental EducationPrograms have been developed for four reasons: 1.to protect the public welfare;2.to guide institutions in developing their academic programs;3.to provide a vehicle for site visit teams to make judgements as to the quality of theprogram; and4.to provide students with reasonable assurance that the program is meeting its statedobjectives.The Standards were designed to meet the following additional goals: 1.improve assessment of quality in dental education programs;2.streamline the accreditation process by including only standards critical to the evaluation ofthe quality of the educational program;3.increase the focus on competency statements in curriculum-related standards; and4.emphasize educational goals to ensure that graduates are life-long learners.The assessment of quality in educational programs is the foundation for the Standards. In order tosharpen this focus on the quality of dental education, the Commission on Dental Accreditation hasincluded standards related to institutional effectiveness. Standard 1, \"Institutional Effectiveness\"guides the self-study and preparation for the site visit away from a periodic approach, byencouraging establishment of internal planning and assessment that is ongoing and continuous. Comments in this introduction were taken, in part. from Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Collegesand Schools, Res. ource Manuel on Institutional Effectiveness, 1992 '124 Dental education programs are expected to demonstrate that planning and assessment areimplemented at all levels of the academic and administrative enterprise. The Standards focus,where necessary, on institutional resources and processes, but also on the results of thoseprocesses and the use of those results for institutional improvement.The following steps outline a recommended approach to an assessment process designed tomeasure the effectiveness of programs and units with educational, patient care, research andservice missions. The assessment process should include: 1.establishing a clearly defined purpose/mission appropriate to dental education, patient care,research and service;2.formulating goals consistent with the purpose/mission;3.designing and implementing outcomes measures to determine the degree of achievement orprogress toward stated goals;4.acquiring feedback from internal and external groups to interpret the results and developrecommendations for improvement (viz., using a broad-based effort for program/unitassessment);5.using the recommendations to improve the programs and units; and6.re-evaluating the program or unit purpose and goals in light of the results.Thus, statement of purpose through planning, formulation of goals and expected outcomes,assessment and use of results for improvement form the foundation for establishing and maintaininginstitutional effectiveness. Taken together, these activities will enhance credibility andaccountability of educational programs.The Standards reconfirm and emphasize the importance of educational processes and goals forcomprehensive patient care and encourage patient-centered approaches in teaching and oral healthcare delivery. Administration, faculty, staff and students are expected to develop and implementdefinitions, practices, operations and evaluation methods so that patient-centered comprehensivecare is the norm.Institutional definitions and operations that support patient-centered caret can have the followingcharacteristics or practices:patients' preferences and their social, economic and emotional circumstances are sensitivelyconsidered;teamwork and cost-effective use of well-trained allied dental personnel are emphasized;evaluations of practice patterns and the outcomes of care guide actions to improve both thequality and efficiency of care delivery; andgeneral dentists serve as role models in the appropriate treatment and referral of patientsneeding advanced therapies.Finally, the Commission encourages the development of a formal liaison mechanism between thedental school and the practicing dental community. Such a mechanism could involve the practicingcommunity in such activities as curriculum development and the clinical program.It is anticipated that the Standards will strengthen the teaching, patient care, research and servicemissions of schools. These Standards are national in scope and represent the minimumrequirements expected for a dental education program. However, the Commission encouragesinstitutions to extend the scope of the curriculum to include content and instruction beyond thescope of the minimum requirements, consistent with the institution's own goals and objectives. 2This definition is taken from. M.J. Field. ed., Oental Education at the Crossroads. Challenges and Change. Institute ofMedicine. National Academy Press. Washington. OC. 1995.125w In these Standards the competencies for general dentistry are described broadly. The Commissionexpects each school to develop specific competency definitions and assessment methods in thecontext of the broad scope of general dental practice. These competencies must be reflective of anevidence-based definition of general dentistry'. These competencies are statements that definecomplex actions that represent the knowledge, skills and values required to provide the carenecessary to achieve oral health goals.The Commission recognizes that schools organize their faculties in a variety of ways. Theinstruction necessary to achieve the prescribed levels of knowledge and skill may be provided bythe educational unit(s) deemed most appropriate by each institution.The importance of academic freedom is recognized by the Commission, and an institution is allowedconsiderable flexibility in structuring its educational program so that it can meet the Standards. TheCommission encourages curricular experimentation, development of institutional individuality andachievement of excellence without the establishment of uniformity. No curriculum has enduringvalue, and a program will not be judged by conformity to a given type.The objectives of the Commission are based on the premise that an institution providing a dentaleducational program will strive continually to enhance the standards and quality of both scholarshipand teaching. The Commission expects an educational institution offering such a program toconduct that program at a level consistent with the purposes and methods of higher education andto have academic excellence as its primary goal. DEFINITION OF TERMSMust: Indicates an imperative need or a duty; an essential or indispensable item; mandatory.Predoctorel: Denotes training leading to the DDS or DMD degree.Instruction: Describes any teaching, lesson, rule or precept; details of procedure; directives.Standard: Offers a rule or basis of comparison established in measuring or judging capacity,quantity, quality, content and value; criterion used as a model or pattern.Competencies: Written statements describing the levels of knowledge, skills and values expectedof graduates.In-depth: A thorough knowledge of concepts and theories for the purpose of critical analysis andthe synthesis of more complete understanding (highest level of knowledge).Competent: The levels of knowledge, skills and values required by the new graduates to beginindependent, unsupervised dental practice. The practice of evidence-based general dentistry means that the dentist integrates individual clinical expertise with the bestavailable external clinical evidence from systematic clinical research. Individual clinical expertise includes effective andefficient diagnosis and thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients' predicaments, rights andpreferences in making clinical decisions about care. External clinical evidence includes clinically relevant research, oftenfrom the basic sciences of medicine and dentistry, but especially from patientcentered clinical research on accuracy andprecision of diagnostic tests and clinical examination, power of prognostic markers, and efficacy and safety of therapeutic,rehabilitative and preventive regimens. This definition is taken from, D.L.Sackett. at al.

PreambleDentists are expected to enhance and promotethe total health of patients through oral health man-agement. Managing oral health care applies to pa-tients with oral pathoses, patients with special needs,and patients with oral manifestations of systemic dis-ease and involves providing ongoing oral health caremanagement. In the course of managing patient care,competent practitioners should recognize the limita-tions of their expertise and refer patients appropri-ately for treatment and coordinate the patient careplan. While dentists may delegate, they have the ul-timate responsibility for comprehensive patient care.Ideally, professional development begins thefirst day the student enters dental school and doesnot end until the day the dentist completely retiresfrom the profession. While this should be a continu-ous process of improvement, the process can be di-vided conveniently into five stages: novice, begin-ner, competent, proficient, and expert.Other than the decision to begin this profes-sional journey, the most significant milepost is theattainment of the first professional degree, which cor-responds to the attainment of professional compe-tencythe ability to begin independent, unsuperviseddental practice. Competencies are abilities essentialto beginning the practice of dentistry. The compe-tencies set forth in this document must be supportedby workingknowledgeof basic biomedical, behav-ioral, and clinical sciences and biomaterials; by cog-nitive and psychomotor skills; and by professionaland ethical values. The integration and applicationof the basic biomedical sciences are considered a criti-cal element in the development of competencies forthe future.These abilities incorporate understanding, skill,and values in an integrated response to the normalrange of problems and challenges in the practice ofdentistry that will allow a graduate to practice safelyand independently. The level of performance requiressome degree of speed and accuracy consistent withpatient well-being.It also requires an awareness ofwhat constitutes acceptable performance under nor-mal circumstances.For the purposes of this docu-ment, competent practitioners must use these abili-ties as the basis for clinical decisions and in profes-sional, patient, and public education. They must havea desire for self-improvement.Because competencies are written to describethe performance of graduates in dental settings, asopposed to the performance of students in courses,the development of competencies is an interdiscipli-nary process.It would be unusual to develop com-petency statements for single disciplines.The AADS intends, over time, to pursue theoriginal plan of the Council of Sections, which is touse the national, core competencies as a foundationfor identifying (1) foundation knowledge and skills,(2) evaluation methods, (3) summaries of the researchfoundation upon which competencies are includedin the curriculum, (4) a glossary of commonly de-fined terms, and (5) educational resources.133556 Journal of Dental Education Volume 61, No. 7 The value and usefulness of these competen-cies will depend on their application and the changesthey effect. By defining the competencies of the newgraduate, schools will have a benchmark with whichto (1) review, redefine, and restructure the predoctoralcurriculum; (2) review and improve student evalua-tion processes and promotion criteria; and (3) estab-lish and apply outcome measures to assess the effec-tiveness of the predoctoral program.These competencies relate to the child, adoles-cent, adult, geriatric, and medically compromisedpatient and are sequenced as they would be in ren-dering care.Professional/Practice CompetenciesTo help dental educators understand these state-ments, certain terms have been defined. In general,the definitions proposed by Chambers and Gerrow(see following article) have been used; new defini-tions have been added, and some have been modi-fied. When it is expected that the new dentist will beable to, and likely to, actually perform the necessaryprocedures, the terms \"perform,\" \"provide,\" \"restore,\"or \"treat\" appear. When the new dentist may per-form some treatment but is more likely to overseetreatment or to refer, the term \"manage\" is used. Theterm \"appropriate\" is not used in these statements toeliminate repetition.Rather, it is assumed that allknowledge, skills, and values described will be usedto perform procedures for appropriate reasons, in ap-propriate circumstances, and in an appropriate man-ner.The new dentist must:General Skills1.

The involvement of so manyeducators from so many schools has cre-ated an awareness and discussion that no singleconcept has engendered in several years. There isalso some confusion as educators use the samewords for different purposes or emphasize oneaspect or another of this emerging idea.This manual is offered as a working documentto aid faculty and administrators exploring andinitiating competency-based dental education. Acommon language is offered that has worked wellin several diverse settings. A (a) definition of theterm competency is proposed (with variations) andsuggestions are made for (b) how to organize agroup of experts to develop competency state-ments and (c) how to format them.It is recognized that competency statementswill only be effective if they are tailored to individ-ual circumstances and if there is 'a sense of owner-ship that results from struggling with andultimately personalizing a set that meets the needsof various user groups. On the other hand, there isvalue in using proven techniques and at least begin-ning with a standardized format.DEFINING COMPETENCY ENZIONEttCompetency in its broadest sense means be-ing able to function in context. From that proteandefinition, it is possible to identify several commonuses of the term in education. Five variants that areheard frequently will be mentioned, along with adiscussion of the circumstances where each vari-ation is customarily encountered. Where uses arelikely to create confusion, this is noted.1. Competency is most often used to describethe skills, understanding, and professional values ofan individual ready for beginning independent den-tal or allied oral health care practice. \"Graduatesare competent because they are capable of func-tioning in realistic practice settings.\"2. Competency is sometimes used in refer-ence to the entire progression of professional learn-ing that extends over ten to 15 years and takesstudents through the stages from beginner to nov-ice to competent, to proficient, and finally to ex-pert. \"The competency continuum requiresincreasingly complex interpretation of material asone becomes competent in wider contexts.\"3. Competency is broadly used to refer to ageneral educational approach focusing on meas-ured outcomes in judging the quality of an educa-tional program. Student outcomes are given highpriority along with the traditional criteria of pro-gram process and efficiency, and alternative strate-gies are identified to handle students who are notcompetent. \"We have a competency-based curricu-lum because we will not graduate anyone whocannot function as a complete general practitio-ner.\"4. Competent is used loosely to signify thesatisfactory completion of an educational experi- VOL. 58/No. 5/1994 JOURNAL DENTAL EDUCATION ,..74A\"feh9,(.%50/' AWAV).0%00.444' 559116FIFST COPY AVAILABLE ence. \"I certify the students who received a D orhigher grade on the practical examination to becompetent to perform restorative dentistry in theclinic.\" Sometimes the term competency is usedwhere \"course requirement\" is intended. \"Requiredcompetency is redundant because all competen-cies are required.\" Because this use is so general itleads to confusion, it is suggested that the term\"qualified\" be used when referring to specific cer-tifying situations.5. Competent is also used in the very broadsense of \"good enough.\" Performing satisfactorilywhen compared to standards (objectively definedor vague) is too imprecise a concept to share theword competency with the first four definitions.\"adequate\" or \"satisfactory\" performance would bea better choice.ORGAMZING THE EXPERTS EMIZESBIn order to produce a competency statementdocument for a discipline as large and diverse asdentistry, the content expertise of many individualswill be needed. Because competencies are by defi-nition interdisciplinary, breadth and openness aredesirable characteristics of the expert panel.A workshop format involving both plenarysessions and small working group sessions willallow sufficient representation to provide both con-tent expertise and constituent representation. Theworkshop will also facilitate participation andhence develop ownership in the final productwhile ensuring that the task gets completed in arealistic time frame.The number of participants will be deter-mined partially by the sponsors and by availablefunds, but the size should be kept as small as possi-ble while still providing content expertise and con-stituent representation. Constituent representationwill be determined by identifying all potential usersof the final competency statement document.These users may be schools, departments, courseand clinic directors, dental associations, licensingauthorities, accrediting organizations, specialtygroups and parent disciplines, and examiningboards. Each of the users must feel that at least oneworkshop participant speaks for their concerns,and there should be a perception of balance andevenhandedneSs. The content expertise should beprovided by a mix of generalists, specialists, privatepractitioners, and educators, some of whom mayrepresent user constituencies as well. In general, aworkshop with 20 to 30 participants seems tofunction well.A workshop organizing committee made upof three to five people including a workshop facili-tator should be appointed by the sponsoring organi-zation. The workshop organizing committeeshould identify and appoint all workshop partici-pants taking into account both content expertise 560and constituent representation. Participants whowill be representing a constituency can be identi-fied by the working committee and approved by theorganization or constituency they represent. Fol-lowing the identification of the content areas foreach of the working groups, participants should beassigned to groups and working group chairs andrecorders appointed.The organizing committee should make a pre-liminary determination of the level and format forthe competency statements. A guide to this step issuggested below. The level will depend almost en-tirely on who the users of the document are. Forexample, a licensing authority may by interestedonly in the identification of fairly general compe-tency areas in order to assist in the development ofa licensing examination blueprint. Schools of den-tistry, on the other hand, may be interested inidentifying competencies at a very specific level inorder to be able to perform outcome measures.The organizing committee will need to decidewhether to use a global competency statement and,if so, must draft that global competency statement.It has been found that providing participants withexamples and competency lists prepared by othergroups is valuable. When possible these should becirculated in advance for study.The organizing committee and any resourcepersonnel must meet with the chairs of the workinggroups to finalize the process to be used during theworkshop and to calibrate the chairs on the formatof the competency statements.The first workshop plenary session shouldbegin with a very brief introduction and could usean outside resource person to provide an overviewof the purpose and process of writing competencystatements. The working groups should then becharged with writing competencies for their iden-tified areas and proceed to their assigned rooms tobegin the process of writing competency state-ments. Chairs should meet throughout the work-shop to review the progress of the groups and torecalibrate themselves in order to ensure that thegroups are working at the same level of detail. Atleast one intermediate plenary session should beheld so that working groups can present examplesof their work and discuss common problems. Thisintermediate plenary session will serve to calibratethe participants, to identify areas of overlap, toidentify areas missed, and to reassure participantsthat the task can be accomplished.A final plenary session should be held at theend of the workshop to review all competencystatements written by all the working groups. Com-ments and revisions should be made on the state-ments so that the workshop as a whole agrees inprinciple with all the competencies. It will likely bepossible to identify areas of overlap, but the identi-fication of missing competencies and consensusapproval is more important.The workshop participants must be asked to JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION VOL. 58/No. 5/1994137 agree to a process that will be used to finalize thecompetency document. It will be remembered thatthe participants have been selected to representvarious constituencies of users of the document. Itcan be suggested that a small committee revise thedraft competencies so that there is consistent styleand wording. Areas of overlap and missing contentareas would also be dealt with by this committee,at least on a preliminary basis.A draft of the final document should be dis-tributed to all participants as quickly as feasible forcomment and approval in principle. Following afinal revision, the document should be distributedto the participants for final approval prior to distri-bution to identified organizations and individuals.There are two parts to this manual having todo with style for writing competency statements:(a) format and (b) glossary. The format suggestionsare meant to standardize the structure of compe-tency statements so they can be more easily writtenand understood across groups. The glossary termsdefine commonly used words. Interpretations ofthese common terms are suggested that permiteconomical expression in the competency state-ments.FORMAT',,,,em,o4,474WwVamesp-'4,404AW4Competency statements are written for spe-cific contexts. Because the general context is al-ways the same for a set of competencies, it can bestated once at the beginning of the set. This makesit possible to express each competency economi-cally. For example, \"A graduate of the School ofDentistry at the University of the Pacific will becompetent to...\"A common three-part structure appears toexpress the content of individual competency state-ments. The use of a standardized structure willmake competency statements easier to compre-hend, less ambiguous, and more complete.1. Verb. Third person singular statement ofthe most significant performance in the compe-tency. \"Restore,\" \"assess,\" and \"refer\" are examples.Experience working with groups writing compe-tency statements reveals that much disagreementand many superfluous qualifying phrases steinfrom efforts to ensure that the action of the compe-tency is performed in a specific manner. This diffi-culty can be partially mitigated by use of theattached glossary which spells out assumptionsabout commonly used verbs. More verbs will berequired as each organization defines its owncom-petency statements, and locally expanded andmodified glossaries are appropriate.2. intna-caronal examples.There are generally two approaches available at thispoint: either a specific procedure can be named(\"provide nutritional counseling\") or a patient con-dition to be corrected can be named (\"single toothdefects\").

Qualifying conditions, special circum-stances, limitations, and explicit outcomes.Many competency statements can be effectivelyexpressed with only a verb and object. There aresituations, however, where greater specificity isrequired. Several examples include: \"Manage behavior by means of both pharmacologicaland nonpharmacological techniques\" (identifica-tion of required types of intervention). \"Recognizethe required level of competency, proficiency, orexpertise and ensure no treatment will be per-formed that compromises the medical or dentalwell-being of the patient\" (specific outcome stand-ard). \"Locate, read, and critically evaluate thepublished dental and related literature and incor-porate such information into one's practice on aregular basis\" (unusual competency using non-glossary terms).Where a performance is optional, it shouldnot be specified. Treating pulpal infections in mul-tirooted teeth is desirable and would satisfy a com-petency for teeth with one or more roots. But iftreatment of the single rooted tooth is the level ofcompetency expected of all graduates, no mentionshould be made of the more complex procedure.Competencies should be numbered and se-quenced in a logical order.

This modifying term is oftenused to signal that special vigilance or professionaljudgment is required. Because adaptation to a nor-mal range of variation is part of all competencies,this term will usually be redundant and should not VOL. 58/No. 5/1994 JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION138561 be used. When writers of competency statements feel pressure to insert the term, they should scan other competencies to make certain that diagnosis has been covered. An alternative is to incorporate special circumstancesthe third part of formatinto the competency statement.Assess. Evaluation of physical, written, andpsychological data in a systematic and comprehen-sive fashion to detect entitiesor patterns that wouldinitiate or modify treatment, referral, or addi- tional assessment. Assessment entails under- standing of relevant theory, and may also entail skill in using specialized equipment or techniques. But assessment is always controlled by an under- standing of the purpose for which it is made and its appropriateness under the present circum- stances. Recognition is a more lithited term that does not subsume the notion of evaluating findings. Diagnosis is a more inclusive term which relates evaluated findings to treatment alternatives.Collect (see obtain).Communicate (see discuss).Competency. Behavior expected of the be-ginning practitioner. This behavior incorporates understanding, skill, and values in an integrated response to the full range of requirements present- ing in practice. The level of performance requires some degree of speed and accuracy consistent withpatient well-being but not performance at the high- est level possible. It also requires an awareness of what constitutes acceptable performance under the circumstances and desire for self-improvement.Conduct (see perform).Consult (see discuss).Develop [a plan) (see perform).Diagnose. Diagnosing means systematicallycomparing a comprehensive database on the pa- tient with an understanding of dental and related medical theory to identify recognized disease enti- ties or treatable conditions. The concept of diagno-sis subsumes an understanding of disease etiology and natural history and a matching of disease entities to available therapies, their advan- tages and risks, and prognosis and side effects asso- ciated with these treatments and with lack of treatment. Assessment is a more limited term that. does not subsume relating findings to alternative treatments.Differentiate (see recognize).Discuss (communicate, consult, explain,present). A two-way exchange that serves both5624,,,,p;mo;g'oro:42;::::*;*),..x:0MVA,the practitioner's needs and those of patients, staff, colleagues, and others with whom the practitioner communicates. The conversation, writing, or other means of exchange must be free of emotional or other distorting factors and the practitioner must be capable of expressing and listening in terms the other party understands. [Caution should be exer- cised with using these verbs to ensure that the communication is between the practitioner and the patient. Communication between the student and faculty is language reminiscent of the old instruc- tional objectives and is not evidence of compe- tency.)Demonstrate. [This term is often used in theold instructional objectives literature to refer to behavior students perform for instructors. It can only be used for competencies where practitioners demonstrate for patients or staff.)Describe.

It can only be used for competencies where practitioners de- scribe to patients or staff.)Design. (see perform).Document. Making, organizing, and pre- serving information in standardized, usable, and legally required format.Educate. The use of discussion and other interpersonal skills to make relatively permanent changes in the behavior and attitudes of patients and employees.Expertise(mastery). A level of practice thatsignificantly exceeds competency. Expertise re- quires many years of practice and education and is seldom achieved across the full range of compe- tencies.

Joanna Fringer, M.A. \"Most of us enter the worldhead first and throughout our lives our faces are a window to self-imageand how the world sees us.Yet there is more to thecraniofacial complex than is in the eye of thebeholder. Although history has resulted in differences in training for dentists, physicians andresearchers, the body's nerves, blood vessels, inflammatorymediators and the like don't recognizeartificial demarcations.\"*BackgroundAnalyses of recent oral epidemiologic data from the third NationalHealth and Nutrition ExaminationSurvey (NHANES III) indicate that women have shared inthe positive oral health trends for the U.S.population. In fact, at face value most available oral health statistics are more favorable for women.'Thus, why highlight the needfor additional research? Two reasons might be that the conditionsunderstudy are highly prevalent among both men and women and that a clustering of oral disease riskfactorvariables places significant numbers of women at high risk fordevelopment of oral diseases.Most oral problems are\"complex\" diseases in that the manifestation of the condition is the result ofmultiple genes and genesusceptibility factors interacting with behavioral and environmental variables. Avariety of demographic, general health, economic, social, andbehavioral factors may be operative inplacing subgroups of women at high risk for developmentof oral diseases. These factors include extendedlongevity, experience with multiple chronic conditions, medications, cognitive impairments,compromisedfunctional status, and physical confinement. Each of these can induce biological or behavioral changes thatadversely affect oral health.'The life situations of significant numbers of women, including their poverty, underinsurance, and statusas single head ofhousehold or family caregiver, may make attending to oral healthand dental treatmentneeds problematic. Socialinfluences such as traditionalgender-role expectations or low income mayinfluence women to deferconsideration of their own oral health status while ensuringthe well-being ofothers. Gender-role expectations may also bear on women'sinteractions with dental careproviders,possibly affecting treatmentrecommendations. Similarly, behavioral patterns on the rise among women,including increases in smoking, unprotected sexual activity, and bulging and purging, will likely lead toparallel increases in oral andpharyngeal cancers, AIDS-related oral pathologies, and tootherosion andcavities.'Another reason to consideroral health an importantissue for women is its association with overallhealth and quality of life. The literature indicates that theprogressive consequences of oral diseases are notonly physical but economic, social, and psychological.3'13This point is underscored bythe frequencywith which fiction and drama exemplify general pain, suffering, or demise with depictions of oral problems. *Excerpt from the Oral Health Working Group Presentation. Putting It All Together: Research on Women'sHealth for the 21\" Century 143 Because oral problems are typically repetitive and cumulative across the life span, disabling and handicapping outcomes are maximized among people in the later stages of life. Yet there are many opportunities throughout the life course to prevent oral problems and/or mitigate their sequelae. In incorporating orofacial issues into the study of women's health, the research community can gain a fuller understanding of women's health needs and help ensure that oral problems do not unnecessarily add to women's health and life burdens in the 21st century. (See Figures 1 and 2 for background information.)Recent Progress AchievedSince its inception in 1990, the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) has worked with the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR) to strengthen and enhance research related to oral diseases, disorders, and conditions that affect women. Collaboration has included the support of several major conferences, including the 1992 Osteoporosis and Oral Bone Loss Workshop, the 1995 Workshop on Selected Chronic Pain Conditions, and the 1997 Technology Assessment Conference on Management of Temporomandibular Disorders.Figure 1.

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Ill Similarly, the NIDR and the ORWH have joined forces to support extramural grants and intramuralresearch projects investigating a wide array of issues of special relevance to women. Areas of focus includeoral conditions that are unique to, more prevalent among, manifest differently in, have different risk factorsfor, or contribute significantly to morbidity among women.By including an oral health working group in the \"Beyond Hunt Valley\" workshop, the ORWH hasafforded women's health researchers, practitioners, and advocates an opportunity to integrate oral issuesinto the broader women's health agenda. Such an integrated, multidisciplinary perspective is needed tofully capitalize on the scientific opportunities of the new millennium.The timing of this opportunity to re-examine oral health issues within the context of gender could notbe better. Fifty years of progress spurred on by Federal investments in craniofacial research have pavedthe way for major advances in the 21st century. Recent advances in the fields of biomaterials, biomimetics,and tissue engineering are being applied to the development of new dental and facial implants,temporomandibular joint (TMJ) prostheses, bone matrix substitutes, and artificial replicas of calcifiedtissues, skin, and mucosa.' Clearly, the predictability of clinical success with these procedures may beinfluenced by gender.Technological improvements have also sparked a renewed interest in using oral biochemical andstructural markers to describe the risk for, presence, and outcome of oral and general health conditions.Taking advantage of the easy access to oral tissues, researchers are already using saliva as an 1,46 investigational diagnostic aid and potential monitor of disease progression. Systemic disorders that affectsalivary gland composition and gland function include Alzheimer's disease, Sjogren's syndrome, cysticfibrosis, diabetes, and diseases of the adrenal cortex.' Saliva is also proving to be an effective tool tomonitor levels of hormones and therapeutic medications, as well as the presence of illicit drugs.\" Despitethese positive advances, the extent to which the oral cavity can be exploited in the study of women's healthhas yet to be fully realized.Oral researchers have begun applying gene transfer technologies to the repair of diseased or damagedsalivary glands and to exploring uses of the salivary gland to produce therapeutic drugs for delivery into themouth or into the systemic circulation.\"' Research opportunities abound to apply these advances to amyriad of conditions affecting women.A new series of experiments recently published indicate that female dental patients respond morefavorably than their male counterparts to kappa opioid analgesics for control of postoperative pain.21.22Because most clinically prescribed analgesics are of the mu opioid type, including morphine, codeine, andpercodan, these findings could be used to benefit the large numbers of women undergoing operativeprocedures. More research is needed to generalize these findings to other clinical situations and to translatethem as appropriate to clinical practice.This observed gender difference in postoperative analgesia has added fuel to long-standing conjecturesabout male/female nervous system differences in response to pain. Indeed, studies in mice have shown thatsome quantitative trait locifor genes associated with responses to pain and analgesia are gender-specific.23-25These findings may help explain why certain painful conditions, including temporomandibular jointdisorders, trigeminal neuralgia, fibromyalgia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, migraine headaches, andburning mouth, are more commonly reported in women.Similarly, new research on gender differences in taste perception may shed light on women's greaterpropensity for some painful conditions!A 27 Oral health scientists have demonstrated that women are morelikely than men to be supertasters to a bitter compound known as 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP).'Supertasters to PROP have more fungiform papillae than non or medium PROP tasters, and experiencemore intense tastes (especially for bitter and sweet), more intense oral burn (e.g., alcohol, capsaicin), andmore intense touch sensations from fats in food (e.g., \"creaminess,\" \"oiliness\").' These findings, coupledwith the fact that fungiform papillae receive innervation from the trigeminal nerve, have led to speculationthat taste perception and experiences with trigeminal neuralgia and burning mouth may be linked.There is new appreciation for the ways in which host factors modulate the susceptibility to andpathogenesis of caries and periodontal diseases, long considered localized infections. For instance,preliminary data from an oral ancillary study of the Women's Health Initiative indicate significant positivecorrelations between oral and hip bone mineral densities?' These findings indicate that oral bone losscaused by periodontal pathogens may be exacerbated by postmenopausal estrogen deficiency. Recentevidence also indicates that persons with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are three times more likelyto develop periodontal disease than nondiabetic individuals. As diabetes increases in severity, the rate atwhich vital tooth-anchoring bone is lost accelerates?\"' Both of these systemic health conditions accountfor significant morbidity among women; these recent oral findings suggest that there is more to thismorbidity than previously considered.Oral effects of systemic disease are by no means limited to the periodontium. From birth to death, themouth's continued exposure to opportunistic infectious pathogens is in balance with host immunity. Whenthe host's immune system is compromised, as with HIV infection, certain microbes' virulence and ability toadhere to and colonize oral tissues is enhanced. Such is the case with C. albicans, whose overgrowth in theoral cavity highly suggests immune suppression. In fact, oral candidiasis is the most common opportunistic 5 1.46 infection seen in HIV and is often used to herald the presence of infection and/or to indicate diseaseprogression.'.\" NIDR-supported research to characterize the entire genome of C. albicans will accelerateprogress in other areas of candida research including virulence factors, drug resistance, genomic evolution, and treatment. The information provided by this line of research will have considerable bearing on HIV-infected and -uninfected women's experiences with oral and genital tract fungal infections. Similarly,saliva's known anti-HIV activity and the intense search to identify protective salivary constituents mayultimately be applied to the formulation of new topical microbicides. In fact, all of oral HIV research,particularly in the areas of opportunistic infections, mucosal immunity, synthetic drugs and vaccines, andinnovative drug delivery systems have tremendous potential to benefit women in that they are the fastest growing population with AIDS.In this new scientific era, there are many reasons to consider oral and general health interactions as bi-directional. In the case of diabetes, new evidence points to chronic periodontal disease as a disrupter ofglucose control, possibly due to induction of insulin resistance.\" Perhaps even more surprising ispreliminary evidence implicating periodontal disease as an independent risk factor for myocardial infarctionand stroke. Epidemiologic findings indicate a nearly twofold risk for fatal myocardial infarction and strokefor persons with established periodontal disease.\" More research is needed, including of a mechanisticnature, to further substantiate these findings. Future research in both the diabetes and heart disease/strokearena should include greater numbers of women and examine potential gender differences in systemicresponses to treating oral infections.Furthermore, the impact of oral infections on the lives of women may relate not only to their own healthbut also to that of their offspring. Recent studies of microbial colonization between spouses and betweenparents and children have demonstrated that oral pathogens are transmitted among members of extendedfamilies.\"' Perhaps even more surprising is emerging evidence that poor maternal periodontal healthincreases an infant's potential for low birthweight and for preterm or premature birth. Recent findingsindicate that severe periodontal disease in pregnant women is linked to a sevenfold increase in the risk ofdelivering preterm low-birthweight babies. It is estimated that as many as 18 percent of the 250,000premature low-birthweight deliveries in the United States each year may be attributed to infectious oral disease.41,42Scientists working in this area theorize that oral pathogens release toxins that reach the human placenta via the mother's blood circulation, as shown by results from animal studies. Additional researchis needed to substantiate this hypothesis and to confirm this intriguing link.With remarkable advances in science, and technology have come increased responsibilities to ensure anadequate supply of competent investigators in the years to come. Education of dental care providers is anincreasingly expensive endeavor for the school and for the individual. In 1996, the average accumulated debt of a graduating dental student was over $81,000. This debt is a significant deterrent to continuingstudies by the dental school graduate, including research training. Furthermore, research training is notpart of the undergraduate dental school curriculum nor is it included in dental residency programs. As aconsequence, dental graduates are not generally exposed to research and are not oriented to pursuingadvanced research training. In the case of female dental students, the situation is further compounded by a lack of role models. Women are underrepresented at all levels of academic dentistry; only 15 percent ofassociate professors and 5 percent of full professors are women. These figures are significantly lower thanthose in the academic medical environment, where twice as many women are at the full professor level.The result of these circumstances is a dearth of women in academics and research. Continued support andenhancement of oral research training and career development programs are needed to help ensure thatwomen can assume leadership roles in academic and health professional institutions, government agencies, and the private sector. 6148 Gaps in KnowledgeLarge gaps in knowledge limit the ability to interpret oral health within the context of gender. Forinstance, there are areas in which oral health information for either gender, even at the descriptive level, ispartial or nonexistent. Data gaps in the areas of craniofacial trauma, soft tissue pathologies, and salivarygland dysfunctions are notable illustrations.Even in the presence of descriptive data, the lack of knowledge about etiologic factors, mechanisms,and clinical course of oral diseases limits the utility of available oral health statistics. For example, womenare reported to be more inclined to self-care, more likely to visit a dentist, and more likely to reportsymptoms such as pain. The degree to which these behaviors influence oral disease patterns is unknown.Similarly, there is a dearth of information on the influence of gender on dental treatment decision-makingand care delivery. Is women's oral health status a reflection of primary disease experience or gender-specific treatment patterns?2In addition, large gaps in knowledge limit the ability to translate scientific advances to improvements inhealth. As previously mentioned, breakthrough discoveries in the areas of biomimetics, biomarkers, genetransfer technologies, and pain research have paved the way for a myriad of clinical applications. Moreresearch is needed to clarify the influence of gender on the predictability of clinical success for newprocedures and pharmacologic regimens.Although progress has been made in recognizing some oral and general health interactions,considerable research is needed to confirm pie-five associations for both genilers uncover biologicbases for these links. Additional research is also needed to determine whether there are gender differencesin responses to therapies for the oral and general health conditions involved in these links.Research RecommendationsAlthough the oral health research community can exult in its many recent successes, new-foundknowledge challenges all of us to do more.

Statistical analysesof tooth loss patterns,dental caries, and periodon-tal diseases conductedutilizing the public use fileindicate, in general, that women have shared in thepositive oral health trendsidentified in the overallU.S. population.'Analyses of these conditions and diseaseswere and2 summarize the resultsof these analyses.

At the extreme end of the tooth loss spectrum,both genders demonstratedsimilar means in thetotally edentate category.Likewise, for employedpersons, similar percentages of males and femaleswere found to have anintact dentition up to andincluding the first molars and hence would likely 742 JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION VOL. 57/No. 10/1993172 Table 1. Gender Differences in Oral Health Status byAge Group: Percent of Persons and p Persons require no prosthetic treatment.3 For seniors, morefemales than males were found to have intact den-titions.DentalCaries-There were larger percent-ages of females than males with coronal cariesamong employed persons and among seniors. How-ever, percentages of personsexhibiting root-sur-face caries were higher for males than females.Periodontal Diseases-Analyses for periodon-tal disease indicate that employed and senior maleshad more gingivitis, recession, and loss of attach-ment than females. Advanced loss of attachment asdefined by 2 sites z4mm or 1 site 261nm proportion of males.Soft Epidemiologic data fororofacial neoplasms are derived from the summaryof the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results(SEER) information of 1983 to 1987.4Overall, men are affected almost threetimes as often as women; a probable con-sequence of long-term tobacco use andalcohol consumption.Salivary Gland Dysfunction-Infor-mationon the incidence of salivary. glanddysfunction, cause of atrophicchanges in oral mucosa, is unavailablefrom national data sets. Reports of dry-ness, local inflammatory diseases, andSjogren's induced hypofunction are morecommon particularly for total number of cases of Sjogrens in theU.S. range from 1 to 4 million and 90percent of those diagnosed are women.9OrofacialPain-Using data from a1989 National Health Interview Surveysupplement, Lipton, et al. found preva-lence rates among women to be consis-tently higher for all types of orofacial painreported withintheprevioussixmonths.10TheNHISfindings are with the joint dysfunctionand myofascial pain, where female-to-maleratios as high as20:1.11 Trigeminal neuralgia, a neuropa-thic condition marked by sharp, stabbingpain in the face, is somewhat more com-mon among women than men. 12Oral Health Behaviors-Using datafrom a 1989 National Health InterviewSurvey supplement, Gift, et al. concludedthat women not only miss more time fromwork and experience more restricted ac-tivity days as a consequence of their owndental visits or problems, but also missmore time from work assisting relatives orfriends.13Pregnancy and the Menopause-Numerous clinical studies have been un-dertaken to describe the oral health status of preg-nant or recently pregnant women. Findings indi-cate that the aggravated gingival reaction to localirritants often seen during pregnancy is transient,and not correlated with any significant loss of at-tachment during pregnancy or postpartum.13 Re-ports of increased caries activity during pregnancyremain controversial.The menopausal influence on oral tissues hasyet to be comprehensively studied. Although drymouth syndrome is sometimes described as a meno-pausal symptom, Ship, et al. found no differencesin salivary flow rates or self-reports of VOL. 57 /No.10/1993JOURNAL OF DENTALEDUCATION 743173 Table 2. Gender Differences in Oral Health Status by Age Group: Percent of Persons and p Value forCorresponding of Seniors BRINGING A NEW Focus TOWOMEN'S ORAL. HEALTHAt face value most available oral health statis-tics seem more favorable for women. Thus, whyhighlight the need for additional research? Onereason might be that there are large areas in whichinformation for either gender, even at the descrip-tive level, is partial or nonexistent. Data gaps in the areas of craniomandibular trauma, soft tissue pa- thologies, and salivary gland dysfunctions nota- ble illustrations.Second, even in the presence of descriptivedata, there are voids in understanding etiologicfactors, mechanisms, and clinical course of oral diseases that limit the ability to interpret oral healthwithin the context of gender. For instance, womenare reported to be more inclined to self-care, more likely to visit a dentist, andmore likely to report symptoms such as pain 10.14 The degree to which these be-haviors influence oral disease patterns is unknown. It is not dear to what extent themore favorable periodontal status of thefemale population has a biological or be- havioral underpinning. Are tooth loss andcaries as measured by tooth count anddecayed filled surfaces the result of 'pri-mary disease experience or treatment pat-terns? The literature indicates a sexual dimorphism in the distribution of estro- gen receptors in the temporomandibularjoint complex and salivary glands but theimplications of this have not been fullyccarnined.17-20 Might thesereceptors helpto explain the preponderance of pathophysiologic symp- toms referable to these tissues?Thirdly, reliance on the more corn-monly used descriptors may not fully rep- resent the nature and extent of significantoral problems. For example, while provid-ing useful information, measures of at-tachment loss and pocket depth focus on a narrow aspect of oral bone status. Clini-cal impressions suggest that the preva- lence of severely atrophic mandibles anddiseased periodontia that are refractory to standard treatments are higher in women than in men, yet there are no data withwhich to support or refute this. Do oro- facial pain statistics and reports of salivarygland dysfunction reflect real differencesin morbidity or gender-related differencesin illness behavior?Last, and perhaps the most signifi-cant reason for re-examining women'soral health is to consider it within therubric of forecasted demographic, generalhealth, economic, social, and behavioral trends.This contextual approach to considering women'shealth issues was successfully employed by the U.S. Public Health Service (P115) under the auspices ofthe Task Force on Women's Health Issues and theNational Institutes of Health's Office of Research on Women's Health. The P115 has marshalled the ef-forts of women's health experts from within thePHS and from external scientific and lay communi-ties to identify substantive issues and develop rec- ommendations for future research on women'shealth. The insights afforded by these experts pro- vide a unique framework for examining women's oral health and serves as the structure for theremainder of this paper.The following text provides a brief overviewof selected, issues that have been identified by PHS expert working groups as concerns for the upcom- ing decade.

As a result,elderly women outnumber elderly men 3 to 2. In1990, this meant that there were nearly 6 millionmore elderly women thanelderly men.21 The fe-male advantage in life expectancy increases thenumber of years of exposure to disease risk factorsand enhances the probability of morbid events.Although the associations of oral diseaseswith systemic health profiles are not well under-stood, it is evident that certain medical conditionsand their treatments can induce biological or be-havioral changes that adversely affect oral health.Throughout their lives, American women re-port more acute symptoms, chronic conditions,and short- and long-term disabilities than men;women's activities are limited by health problems25 percent more days each year than men.s.22,23The gender gap in physical disability widens withadvancing age.24,25 Women in nursing homes orpersonal care facilities outnumber men three toone.26Osteoporosis, stroke, degenerative rheuma-toid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus are more preva-lent among older women than older men. 22-'23, 26-29These physical conditions can create serious prob-lems in ambulation, restricting access to servicesand ability for selfcare. In 1990, of the 13 millionwomen aged 70 or older, more than 21/2 millionwere either unable or limited in their ability to carryon major activities.30The rate of affective disorders for women isalmost twice that for men. Females start showinghigher rates of depression at puberty and this dis-parity widens in later years. Senile dementia, ofwhich Alzheimer's disease is the best known type,occurs more frequently in women than in men.31Elderly women use sedatives, hypnotics, an-tianxiety drugs, antihypertensive medications, diu-retics, tranquilizers at a rate 21/2 times that ofelderly men.32 Higher utilization patterns of medi-cations add to the likelihood of polypharinacy, drugmisuse, and drug-induced functional and mentalimpairments.Breast cancer affects more women than anyother cancer, accounting for almost one third of allmalignancies. In 1991, 67,500 women died fromcancers of the breast and reproductive tract 33As the preceding information indicates, sig-nificant numbers of women experience compro-mised functional status, physical confinement,medical conditions, and cognitive impairments.22-33 The literature indicates that these factors haveimportant implications for oral health risk, anddental treatments.34'39 They may limit the individ-ual's ability to maintain oral hygiene self-care regi-mens, seek professional dental services, toleratedental treatmentcomply with postoperativeinstructions.34.3' Systemic health profiles commonamong women can induce biological changeswhich adversely affect oral health. For instance,diabetes and the presence of co-morbidities maycompromise immune function leaving the patientvulnerable to oral infections, including periodonti-tis and oral mucosaldiseases.36 Stroke, diabetes,arthritis, and affective disorders can adversely af-fect oral functions and patients may exhibit oro-pharyngeal symptoms such as dysphagia.37Pharmacologic regimens common among womencan promote xerostomia thereby increasing the riskof caries, periodontal diseases, and atrophic/dis-ease changes in oralmucosa.9 As a consequence ofchemotherapy for breast cancer, women may sufferinflammation and ulceration of oral Al. kECTING WOMEN'SHEALTHA variety of economic, social, psychological,and behavioral factors may also be operative inplacing women at high risk for development ofdiseases, including oral health problems. As agroup, women are economically disadvantaged incomparison with men, regardless of age, race, eth-nicity, education, or employment status. Data fromthe Bureau of the Census indicate that althoughwomen made up 58 percent of the elderly popula-,tion in the United States in 1990, they accountedfor 74 percent of the poor elderly.21In 1986, 38 percent of women 18 years andolder had dental insurance.40 Although that repre-sents a significant number of women with dentalbenefits, dental plans traditionally provide limitedcoverage and require high cost sharing. Sincewomen overall have lower incomes than men, lackof insurance and high co-payments for dental serv-ices may represent formidable obstacles to care. Inaddition, women assume a disproportionate bur-den as caretakers for family members of all ages: theyoung, the sick, and the elderly.41 This often dis-rupts employment and, consequently, insurancecoverage.Behavioral patterns may also contribute to thedevelopment of diseases that have implications fororal health. At present, more school age girls thanboys are regular smokers by the time they reach10th grade. Adolescent girls are now smoking at arate of 29 percent.42 Among adults, women as agroup have been relatively resistant to smokingcessation efforts. It has therefore been predictedthat in two or three years there will be more femalethan male smokers in the U.S. population. Similarly,sexual activity and related disease trends are ad-versely impacting women's health. Women are thefastest growing population with AIDS.Finally, socialization factors and psychologicaldeterminants may be placing women in a vulner-able situation for health problems in general and forrelated oral health difficulties. Many women con-tinue to demonstrate passive and dependent behav-iors and low self- esteem.43 These may relate towomen's experiences with domestic violence, eat-ing disorders, stress, and depression as well as totheir general interaction with the health care sys-tem. Investigations of the health care system indi-cate that women are often treated with less respectand dignity and that male physicians may be lesssensitive to women's needs.32The social, economic, and life-style situationsspecified above have been implicated as correlatesof oral diseases. Poverty, underinsurance, and 746status as single head of household may make attend-ing to oral health and dental treatment needs prob-lematic for many women. Complex role patternsinvolving employment and care-giving may influ-ence a woman's abilitand willingness to practicepreventive behaviors and seek professional dentalcare.Concerns for the upcoming decade relate toincreases in smoking and unprotected sexual activ-ity, which will likely be accompanied by parallelincreases in oral and pharyngeal cancers and AIDSrelated oral pathologies. As a consequence of bing-ing and thermalhypersensitivity, gender-role expectations or lowincome may influence some women to defer con-sideration of their own oral health status whileensuring the well-being of others. Gender-role ex-pectations may also bear upon women's interac-tion with the dental care provider; possiblyaffecting treatment recommendations. Issues oforofacial appearance may be of particular rele-vance to women not only because they bear adisproportionate burden of esthetic demands, butbecause cultural norms also put women at greaterrisk of internalizing them.43 Hence, poor orofacialappearance may pointedly affect a women's senseof worth, social interactions, career, and life op-tions.Conversely, some female-typed behaviors mayhave protective effects. For instance, concerns foresthetics and gender-role expectations may resultin more attention to oral health with a positiveoutcome. Overall, women report engaging in oralhealth behaviors, such as brushing, flossing, andvisiting the dentist more often than do men. 4THE CHALLENGE BEFORE USMany women exhibit good oral health andoral health behaviors and have supportive socialand environmental structures. Yet large groups ofwomen, notably the aged, chronically ill, thoseadopting dysfunctional behaviors, and those in ornear poverty appear to be at higher risk. These riskfactors and how to address them are poorly under-stood.The clustering of risk factor variables relevantto the oral health of significant numbers of womensummons us to recognize and respond to theirneeds. Medical conditions, functional disabilities,medication use, poverty, underinsurance, and ad-verse behaviors appear to be associated with vari-ous risk factors for oral diseases. Each of these,taken in the context of future demographic, socio-economic, and health trends, is serious. But it is theinterplay among these various biologic, behavioral,and social forces that will continue to shape the oralhealth status of women. JOURNAL OF DEV4C4ItkDUCATION VOL. 57 /No. 10/1993176 Recognizing the array of factors that affectwomen's oral health can help to direct research inidentifying important preventive measures andtreatment recommendations. Although gender-comparative research is still needed to better de-scribe diseases for which the rates are greater inwomen, it must not be the only focus. If potentialareas for study are identified solely on this basis,important differences in etiologic factors, mecha-nisms of diseases, and responses to therapy may beoverlooked. Potential areas for inclusion in awomen's oral health agenda should be selectedbecause they are important issues for women; im-pacting their health and/or quality of life. References1.

In Europe there is some evidence that socially deprived rural women have the highest levelsof edentulism Due to the lack ofadequate detail in published reports ofstudie4 it is difficult to relate the oral health of womenwith the atacceptability, and accessibility of dental services Women tend to attend for dental care more regularlythan men though there is some evidence that women are more fearful of dentaltr eatment and also perceive cost as a barrierto dental care Data from the Republic of Ireland suggest that women working in the home have higher levels of tooth lossand edentulirm than those corking outside the home. There is a need forconsensus on methods ofreporting oral health datain major descriptive studies Further research is required to investigate why women tend to lose their natural teeth at anearlier age than men.Key Words: women's oral health, tooth loss, edentulism, oral epidemiology Dr \u00b0Mullane is professor, Dr. Whelton is lecturer, and Dr. Galvin is a research fellow, all at the WHO CollaboratingCenter for Oral Health Services Research University Dental Schoo4 Wilton, Cork, Ireland Send correspondence and reprintrequests to Dr. O'Mullane he most striking evidence of the poorerThealth of women as compared with thatof men are the figures for edentulismreported in surveys conducted in Europein recent years. For example, in theUnited Kingdom, 25 percent of the male popula-tion aged 16 years and over was edentulous in 1978compared with 33 percent of females. While thepercentage of edentulous had declined between1978 and 1988 the differences between males andfemales remained, the percentages being 16 and 25percent respectively in 1988.1 Similar differencesbetween males and females have been reported inanstudies conducted in Ireld,23 Finland, 4 Yugosla-via,5 the Netherlands,6 and in Alvsborg County,Sweden? In the U.S., females also tend to havehigher levels of edentulism though the trend is notconsistent in all age and race groups.8.9Various explanations for the higher level oftooth loss among women have been proposed, butthese have been mainly hypothetical. For example,it has been argued that tooth loss reflects the avail-ability of dental services and attendance patterns, Vol_ 57/No. 10/1993hence one explanation for the higher level of eden-tulousness among females is that they are morelikely to seek replacement for an inadequate andunaesthetic dentition as indicated by their betterattendance pattem.2 Clearly tooth loss and its morepositive corollary, the mean number of naturalteeth present, are not merely a reflection of dentaldisease but reflect social and cultural factors inher-ent in both patients and those who treat them andin the system of delivering dental care 8.10 No doubtthese social and cultural influences are changingrapidly and partly account for the decline in thelevels of edentulousness in developed countries inrecent years. For example, one explanation for thehigh levels of edentulousness in older women fromrural communities in Ireland and the United King-dom is the fact that up to the 1940s women had alltheir natural teeth extracted and dentures fittedwhen they reached the age of 21 or as part of theirmarriage dowry, whichever came first. Apparentlythis practice was looked upon with favor by theprospective husband since dentures often replacedan unsightly broken-down dentition and also the179JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION 1749BEST COPY AVAILABLE Table 5.

In attempt-ing to explain these differences further analysisshowed that women, especially those less well offcited costs and fear as barriers to dental care morethan men. As in the United Kingdom data, whilethe less well off attended the dentist considerablyless frequently, the more affluent women weremore frequent attendees than all other eligibilitygroups.In response to the survey conducted in Ire-land in 19792 that first reported higher levels ofedentulousness in Irish women, anecdotal com-ments over the years have included the observationthat Irish women working in the home (house-wives) are likely to sacrifice their own health carefor the sake of the rest of the family. The datacollected in the recent survey in the Republic ofIreland gives some credence to this observation.For example, those women eligible under the socialinsurance scheme includes those eligible for careunder their own PRSI (women working outside thehome) and those eligible for care under theirspouses PRSI working in the home (housewives).For women aged between 25 and 64 the meannumber of natural teeth present in the formergroup (n\"126) was 18.0 while for housewives(n-56) the corresponding mean was 16.7. The per-centage of women working outside the home with18 or more sound untreated teeth was 20 comparedwith 12 percent of housewives. The nature of thedata collected in the Irish study also allows the totalfemale sample (i.e., irrespective of eligibility) to bedivided into those working outside the home andhousewives. Using these subgroups and combiningages 25 to 64, the mean number of natural teethpresent in the former group (n-99) was 17.7 com-pared with 15.3 for all housewives (n-435). Thepercentages of subjects with 18 or more sounduntreated natural teeth were 20.2 and 13.9 respec-tively. Due to the low numbers in these groups it isperhaps wise to interpret these data with caution.CONCLUSIONIt is regrettable that many major na-tional and regional surveys do not give abreakdown of the results by gender. Forthat reason, this presentation's descrip-tion of women's oral health as comparedwith men's is necessarily confined totooth loss and number of natural teethpresent. While it could be argued thatthese outcomes represent an objectiveend result of the ongoing risk of caries andperiodontal disease among populationsand of the many complex social and cul-tural interactions leading to extraction ofteeth, nevertheless, those conducting sur-veys of oral health should be encouragedto report gender differences in an agreed mannerfor other outcome variables. Further research isneeded to investigate why women have tended tolose their natural teeth at an earlier age then men.It is important that specific studies be undertakento explain these differences.

The purpose of this presentation is two-fold; first, to respond to the previouspresentations from a woman dental edu-cator's perspective and second to offersome suggestions, perhaps provocativeones, for the future role that dental schools asinstitutions, and dental educational programs asvehicles, may play in shaping how our professionand other professions recognize the importance ofwomen's oral health as an essential component ofour health care agenda and incorporate specificinterventions to address current and future needs.AN EDUCATOR'S PERSPECTIVE NMIn 1986, at the annual meeting of the Ameri-can Public Health Association, a gentleman in thedental health section was presenting the results ofhis study on the progression of periodontal diseasein 100 U.S. male subjects. When a female memberof the audience asked why data from women hadnot been included in the research, the presenterresponded that he did not want to confound thedata. The researcher did not include another seriesof parallel data for the results of progression ofperiodontal disease in female subjects; womenwere excluded from the study on the basis ongender. Although it might be argued that techni-cally the researcher was correct, the data baseoutcome and health care outcome is that womenhave not been included as equals in health careresearch nor benefited equnIty from health careknowledge and services.In 1993, a female dental researcher was con-sulting on the analysis of extensive data collectedon a large sample of New England elders. Theresearcher suggested that the data be examined toexplore whether differences exist between gen-ders on any of the variables selected as data points.The head of the project responded, \"What a cleveridea. It certainly would be the politically correctthing to do.\"Women's health issues and women's oralhealth issues are not data confounders or contami-nants, nor are they political pawns. Women com-prise 52 percent of the U.S. population. Knowledgeand information about women's systemic diseasesand primary and secondary oral manifestations ofdisease is only beginning to be acquired. Histori-cally, it seems that whatever attention there hasbeen towards women's oral health has been linkedto children under the umbrella of \"oral health ofmothers and children.\" In 1989, there was a four-day workshop in Washington entitled, \"Equity andaccess for mothers and children: strategies from thePublic Health Service on oral health of mothers andchildren.\"1 But the issues of women's health andoral health are greater in magnitude than even thesignificant problems of motherhood. Under theleadership of Drs. Bernadine Healy, Vivian Pinn,and Ruth Kirschstein for the National Institutes ofHealth, and the Office of Research on Women'sHealth, and Dr. Agnes Donahue at the Office onWomen's Health, we are starting to formulate thequestions which need to be addressed. However,in the 1991 NTH report on Opportunities for Re-search on Women's Health,2 oral health was notmentioned. At a January 1993 regional hearing ofthe Senate Committee on Labor and Human Re-sources, chaired by Massachusetts' Senator Ken-183VOL. 57/NO. 10/1993 JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION 759 nedy and attended by Dr. Healy, the topic of discus-sion was women's health. All of the invited speak-ers were women, and although many importantsocial and health problems were highlighted, noone discussed the issue of oral health in women.This symposium has considered women's oralhealth issues. As dental educators, it is important tonot only realize where gender-related differencesmay lie, but to question the reasons for those differ-ences. For example, women's edentulism was citedas striking evidence of the poorer health of women.As dental educators, we have the opportunity totarget outreach programs and marketing effortstowards women. And then, we need to go beyondthe prima facie evidence and address possible con-tributing causes. Despite the fact that United Statesdata show females to be more frequent utilizers ofdental services than males, strategies to facilitateaccess for women who underutilize servicesshould be explored. Perhaps providing on site childcare at community health centers and dentalschools might facilitate access to dental services forthose women who underutilize them. How dowomen utilize dental school services? Informationpertaining to gender of dental school patients is notreported in the American Dental Association An-nual Report.3 It might be helpful to request andassess those data to enable dental educators tobetter understand the patient pool profile and theirneeds.Dr. Donahue discussed the Public HealthService Action Plan for Women's Health. Dentaleducators must heed each of the interventions thatthe plan calls for, esperii fly in the cases of the callfor \"...education and information, training, andpolicy.\"4 Dental education is already responding.The American Association of Dental Schools, underthe leadership of Drs. Preston Littleton and JeanSinkford, initiated an Office of Women's and Minor-ity Affairs. A liaison officer has been identified ateach of the dental schools for primary responsibil-ity in each of those areas. The liaison officers forwomen will focus on improving the environmentfor female faculty and students through informa-tion exchange, networking, and mentoring.5At whom are these services targeted? Themost recent (1992/1993) American Dental Associa-tion supplement to the Annual Report on DentalEducation,6 indicates that in 1991-92, women com-prised 36 percent of total predoctoral enrollment.However, in a ten-year period, there has only beena 15.8 percent increase in the percentage ofwomen choosing to matriculate in dental schools.Clearly there is ample opportunity to increase thefemale applicant pool. The ADA data show that thenumber of applications to dental school by womenhas not grown in the 10-year reporting period, andwith the exception of 1991, has actually dropped.The reality is that the increased percentage ofwomen in dental school Hisses is actually due to 760declining numbers of male students in dentalschools. If the assumption is made that currentenrollment levels for women in dental schools willmaintain, then it might. be expected that increasednumbers of women in the school and the professionmay assist in furthering awareness of women's oralhealth. issues. in,theeducation, sesearch, .and clini-cal arenas. However, the fact that there are propor-tionately more women in dental school by no meanspredicts changes in curricular or research focus. Itwill be critically important to continue to recruitwomen into the profession and to encourage andfacilitate their assumption of leadership positionswithin the power circles and decision-making bod-ies in education, research, and clinical practice.Although 1990 reports7 indicated thatwomen dental school faculty are clustered at thelow end of the faculty career ladder, more recentdata show some encouraging signs are appearing.Based on a 1992 AADS survey, a number of womenhave risen to a decanal rank. As of this presentation,there are no female full deans at U.S. dental schools.One Canadian dental school appointed a womandean in 1992. There are now 27 female administra-tors who possess the title of assistant or associatedean.9It is exciting to consider the dental educator'srole in helping to formulate gender-related researchquestions and communicating new research find-ings to professionalsboth for current students andin continuing education courses for practicing den-tists, and explaining some of the reasons behind thenumbers. An instance of the latter may be seen inthe statement that women requiring care in nursinghomes or personal care facilities outnumber menthree to one.9 It may be as important to understandwhy this occurs as to acknowledge the predomi-nance of women in long-term care facilities. Sincewomen tend to be the primary personal caregiversin the home, it is clear that when the male spouseis gone and the woman has difficulty in meeting herown personal care needs (or activities of dailyliving), there is often no one to help her. Thereforethe responsibility for nursing and personal care isdelegated to and borne by the long-term care facil-ity. But as the presenter pointed out, there are manysocial, economic, psychological, and behavioralfactors affecting women's oral health. How manydental schools, one wonders, cover the followingpotential etiologies of women's oral health prob-lems in differential diagnosis: sexually transmitteddiseases, domestic violence, anorexia and bulimia,homelessness, child abuse, elder abuse, poverty,smoking, or depression? STRATEGIESWhat strategies might we consider to includewomen'sfrg rth issues in dental education in a JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION VOL. 57/No. 10/1993 meaningful way? The following are five suggestedstrategies for further consideration, discussion, anddebate.Strategy1Includewomen's oral health top-ics within appropriate AADS curriculum guide-lines in such areas as biochemistry and nutrition,behavioral sciences, community and preventivedentistry, oral biology, oral diagnosis, and oralmedicine, to name just a few areas. Inclusion ofseparate women's health guidelines where appro-priate would highlight the importance of theseareas within respectivedisciplines.Strategy2Specify and include women's oralhealth and women's role in educating structureamong accreditation curriculum guidelines.
