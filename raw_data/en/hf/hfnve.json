The staff there -- including the clinic's operations director, Robin Marty -- is determined to keep the clinic open and do whatever it can to legally support pregnant people across the state - stopping short of abortion care. In a candid interview that spanned more than an hour, the clinic's operations director Robin Marty brought him up to speed on what abortion care in the state looks like at this juncture. \"I hope that at some point the legislature understands is that they aren't shutting down abortion clinics -- they're overburdening hospitals that were already in crisis.\" Hospitals are \"overwhelmed,\" says Marty. Pregnant people in Alabama are such a low priority for health care in general, that if you go into a hospital that has all of these pressing needs, they're gonna put you aside because they figure it's 'just a pregnancy issue.'\"", "sitename": "MSNBC.com", "date": "2022-08-13", "cleaned_text": "- UP NEXT 'Chaos Caucus' ready to hold Congress hostage in push for Biden impeachment10:25 A warning from Alabama clinics on abortion: \"this is coming for blue states\"08:42 republic'05:19 Laurence Tribe: If Trump doesn't qualify for insurrection clause, nobody would14:49 When AI and Book Banning Collide05:28 CO Secretary of State: Trump is a liar with no respect for the Constitution05:40 CREW: Trump's attorneys concede CO suit will stay in state court05:12 Morocco earthquake death toll exceeds 1,00003:52 Velshi: Stop allowing Trump to thrive off martyrdom04:06 Velshi: The U.S. should not reward Israel's bad behavior05:45 Judge Luttig: Supreme Court will determine if Trump is eligible to run for president 'sooner rather than later'10:16 'We're in uncharted territory here': MI Secretary of State on case for disqualifying Trump08:24 Did the U.S. drag its feet on domestic terror?08:19 Could Trump be found 'willfully blind'?07:20 Rep.
