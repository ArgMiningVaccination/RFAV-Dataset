As needed, people with HIV should receive assistance: Navigating the healthcare and social services systems; Coordinating logistics such as transportation , interpretation and childcare to ensure that they have ready access to their care providers; Reviewing their eligibility for government -funded benefits and programs to provide the best possible financial assistance, medical insurance and stable housing; and Overcoming personal and contextual barriers to antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence. All people with HIV can expect that critical health information is available to providers when they need it, and that adequate security measures are in place to safeguard its confidentiality. BACKGROUND In the United States, mor e than 1 million ( 1,144,500) persons aged 13 years and older are living with HIV infection in the United States today . 2 New York City continues to be at the epicenter of the U.S. epidemic, with 114,926 New Yorkers reported to be living with HIV/AIDS as of the end of 2012.3 While advances in medical care for people with HIV have been significant, disparities exist in access to health care and health outcomes for this population. Factors associated with poorer health outcomes include being unstably housed or homeless, being an injection drug user, having a mental illness, and having a lower 1 Refer to the Definitions section (Appendix A) for definitions referenced throughout the manual. 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 5 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control socioeconomic status. Many of these factors disproportionately impact persons belonging to racial/ethnic minority groups in NYC, and increas e the likelihood that they will be out of care and access care later in their disease. The association between these social and environmental factors with poor clinical outcomes among people with HIV makes facilitating access to and maintenance in HIV primary care as well as integrating medical care with social support a high priority . In December 2005, DOHMH and Department of Homeless Services (DHS) reported that of the 88,014 New Yorkers who were known to be living with HIV/AIDS from 2001 through 2003, 3,108 (about 4%) used the homeless shelter system for at least one night during the study period 4. The report also found that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among users of the single adult shelter system was more than twice as high as the prevalence in the NYC adult population. Additionally, a study published by the CDC found that compared to the stably housed, homeless people with HIV were more likely to be uninsured, to have visited an emergency department, and to have been admitted to a hospital. Moreover, homeless PLWHA persons had lower CD4 counts, were less likely to have taken HIV anti -retroviral medications, and were less adherent to their medication regimen5. To respond to these needs, the NYC DOHMH has allocated funds for a Critical Time Intervention (CTI ) 6 model which provides cas e management services and care coordination services for the homeless and unstably housed to address issues and challenges specific to this population. With significant support from the National Institute of Mental Health and the New York State Office of Mental Health, CTI was originally developed and tested by researchers and clinicians at Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute . The model is listed i n the National Registry of Evidence- Based Programs and Practices and is currently being applied and tested in the US (including programs in NYC) and abroad. CTI has been successfully used to support and stabilize persons with mental health disorders and homelessness. As such the model is suitable for adaptation to serve PLWHA persons experiencing homelessness. CTI is an empirically supported, time- limited case management model originally designed to reduce homelessness among persons with severe mental health disorders by bridging the gap between services for the homeless and community services. DOHMH has adopted the evidence- based model to a broader population (not restr icted to severely mental ill). This adaptation has resulted in the Transitional Care Coordination Program (TCC) . The five phases of this intervention are : Outreach, Transition, Try -Out, and Transfer of Care , and Follow -up. Clients are identified and enrolled in TCC through targeted case finding and self -referral during the Outreach phase. In Transition , the client and Transitional Care Coordinator formulate a treatment plan, focusing on areas identified as crucial in facilitating 4 Kerker B, Bainbridge J, Li W, et al .

During the Try-Out phase, the client and Transitional Care Coordinator test and adjust the systems of support that have been established in the community during the Transition phase. In the Transfer of Care phase, smaller adjustments in the network of support are made and linkage to a supportive housing or appropriate case management program will provide longer -term care coordination support is completed. Finally, in the Follow -up phase, the Transitional Care Coordinator contacts community linkages to verify client engagement and retention. Additionally , in each phase, the TCC team assesses concrete needs (i.e., medication compliance, money management, substance abuse management, housing crisis management, and family interventions). Health promotion ac tivities and accompaniment services are provided during Transition, Try -out, and Transfer of Care phases. The TCC team also links client s to appropriate resources, and avoids providing direct, assertive care. PURPOSE This Program Manual is intended to : Be a requirement for Ryan White (Part A) TCC Programs per the terms of the contract (solicited through the TCC Request for Proposals and updated via contract modification) . Be a reference for Transitional Care C oordination provi ders for the purpose of delivering transitional case management for people with HIV . GOALS OF TRANSITIONA L CARE COORDINATION The goals of TCC are to improve care for people with HIV who are homeless or unstably housed 7 by: 1) Ensuring entry into and continuity of HIV primary medical care; and 2) Providing linkage to housing services and other support social services; and 3) Decreasing unnecessary Emergency Room and h ospitalization visits. 7 The term \"homeless\" is used to define individuals who: lack a regular and/or adequate nighttime residence; have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private shelter or dwelling designed to provide temporary l iving accommodations, including SROs; live in an institution that provides temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized; or live in a public or private place not intended or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. The term \"unstably housed\" expands on the definition of \"homeless\" to also include individuals who frequently move between housing situations, individuals who are facing eviction, and/or individuals who are temporarily living with family or friends. Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 7 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control ELEMENTS OF THE MANUAL 1.0 Practice Standards 1.1 The TCC team ensur es the execution of the C omprehensive Care Plan. 1.2 Screen all client s for eligibility in the Program and coordinate with similar programs so client s receive streamlined, unduplicated services. 1.3 Address urgent needs and schedule follow -up medical care during intake. 1.4 Program staff should encourage clients to speak with their primary care provider about starting anti -retroviral therapy (ART) and inquire about barriers and challenges to initiating ART (e.g., substance use or unstable housing). 1.5 Maintain up- to-date contact information for client s. 1.6 Perform a detailed assessment of housing and social services and benefits and logistic al needs in order to guide the client's care plan development . 1.7 Provide health promotion to all TCC clients using core curriculum developed by PACT and DOHMH. 1.8 Assist people with HIV to attain self -sufficiency and successfully graduate to either supportive housing, Ryan White Part A Care Coordination, Medicaid Health Home, or other case management program (depending on client needs) . 1.9 In order to ensure that confidentiality law or related institutional policies do not preclude ready transfer of sensitive pers onal health information, the Program must ensure that a valid client consent to release HIV information is always on file. 1.10 Develop monitoring guidance and quality management activities . 1.11 Report relevant program service and client data to DOHMH. 1.12 Contractors are required to have a written emergency preparedness plan. 2.0 Components of Transitional Care Coordination 2.1 Full Range of TCC Program Services 2.1.1 How does TCC work? 2.1.1.1 TCC p rovides emotional and practical suppor t during the critical time of transition to community care. 2.1.1.2 TCC c onnects people with formal services (e.g. primary care, case management) and informal community supports (i.e. friends, family, clergy) in the critical period. 2.1.1.3 TCC is a time -limited intervent ion, divided into five (5) specific Phases with decreasing service intensity over time. 2.1.1.4 TCC f ocus es on six (6) treatment areas that promote client stability through a range of program activities . Six Areas of Focus Main Goal Medical Linkage to a primary care provider Health Delivering Health Promotion guide topics Housing Linkage to a housing placement provider Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 8 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Case Management Services Linkage to a supportive housing, Ryan White Part A Care Coordination , Medicaid Health Home, or other case management program (depending on client need ) Benefits/Entitlements Assistance Providing access to entitlements Building Support Network Developing diverse social supports 2.1.2 The Spirit of TCC 2.1.2.1 An intrinsic belief in the possibility of wellness for people with HIV and other special needs 2.1.2.2 The relationship between staff and client is one of collaboration 2.1.2.3 The best approach to working with clients is one that is person- centered and strength- based 2.1.2.4 The client is the expert on his/her own need, and has the right to the best p ossible services 2.1.2.5 Works with gradual change (harm -reduction and motivational interviewing approach to behavior change) 2.1.2.6 Continues to maintain work with a client despite changes in client location or circumstance (no drop- out policy) 2.2 Phase 0: Outreach 2.2.1 This p re-program phase focuses on targeted case finding and referral to and coordination of HIV testing. Once client s are engaged, confirmed HIV - positive and referred to the program, they will move to Phase 1. 2.3 Phase 1: Transition to Transitional Care Coordina tion Program Phase 2.3.1 Occurs months 1-3 2.3.2 Referrals to the TCC program may come from the Outreach Specialist or other service providers. The referring party should provide key information about the client 's social service (s) and housing status. The client may also self-refer. 2.3.3 During the enrollment process client s should be assessed for eligibility and needed benefits , and clients should provide informed consent to participate in TCC. 2.3.4 An initial assessment should screen for unmet needs including, but not limit ed to, housing, food, medical provider , substance use, mental illness and case management services . In accordance with the payer of last resort regulations, client s must be assessed for eligibility for other programs providing similar services (i.e., Medic aid, Medicare, HASA, etc.). A detailed description of how to conduct program intake assessment can be found in Section 6.0. Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 9 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control 2.3.5 Staff conducting intake should provide client with an overview of TCC, ensuring that a conversation on staff roles/expectations throughout the different program phases takes place. 2.3.6 Health promotion conversations may be utilized in the assessment process. For example, Conversation K: Understanding Social Support and Conversation L: Disclosure and Networks of Social support may be used to assess for client's current informal supports. 2.3.7 It is important to establish a trusting and solid relationship during this Phase. Therefore, cultural and linguistic competencies are essential. 2.3.8 Phase 1 focuses on providing intensive support and assessi ng existing or potential client 's resources. 2.3.9 TCC staff members are expected to support client s through phone calls, face-to-face meetings, and home visits to engage the clients and support progress o n the care plan. Contact during this P hase, particularly early on, is expected to be frequent , intensive and supportive. 2.3.9.1 At least one (1) call or meeting with either a formal support (community -based service provider) or informal support (friend, family, and clergy) is expected to take place during the first month of enrollment. 2.3.9.2 At least three (3) in- person community -based meetings with the client are expected during Phase 1. 2.3.9.3 At least two (2) calls or meetings with either a formal support (community -based service provider) or informal support (friend, family, an d clergy) is expected to take place during the first month of enrollment. 2.3.10 The Transitional Care Coordinator has thirty (30) days from the point of enrollment to develop a Comprehensive Care Plan ( Appendix J ) in collaboration with the client that addresses the client 's presenting needs. 2.3.10.1 Only one (1) to three (3) areas of focus should be selected per care/plan. 2.3.10.2 Each area of focus chosen in the care plan should be accompanied in the care plan by a reason/ rationale. 2.3.10.3 General actions steps should be recorded for each area 2.3.10.4 The full plan must include the signature of both the client and Transitional Care Coordinator. 2.3.11 Development of primary care and housing goals should begin in this Phase as these are seen as high priorities of the program. 2.3.12 Outreach Specialists a re expected to offer and accompany client s to HIV primary car e visits and supportive service appointments (as needed) . 2.3.13 Reassessments (Appendix P, Comprehensive Care Plans, and the required PCSM updates (Appendix Q) should occur every 90- 120 days as a client transition s from one Phase to the next . On the Comprehensive C are Plan, only ongoing service goals should carry over to the next P lan, noting that only one to three areas of focus will be included. Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 10 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control 2.4 Phase 2: Try Out Phase 2.4.1 Occurs months 4-6 2.4.2 Phase 2 is devoted to testing and adjusting the systems of support that were developed in P hase 1. The role of TCC staff should also change during this P hase. In- person contact with the client should begin to decrease and staff should play a more supportive role monit oring the efforts of community resources and other service providers. During this P hase, staff should be prepared to provide mediation between the client and their support network and/or providers. They should also be aware that clients may need to change providers before finding one with whom they are comfortable. 2.4.3 Contact and introductions should be made with either supportive housing, Ryan White Part A Care Coordination program , Medicaid Health Home , or other case management program (depending on client 's needs) to begin discussion of the client 's transition and to introduce the client to the selected provider (s). As linkages with providers and support networks increase, contact with TCC team members decreases as appropriate. 2.4.4 TCC team should reinforce st aff roles and expectations, reminding client and service providers that face -to-face contact will steadily decrease in Phase 2. However, t he worker will remain supportive of the client by testing the strength of linkages created. 2.4.5 Through coordination with other service provider s and support contacts, staff should document the specific ways in which linkages to formal and informal supports are (or are not) working in progress notes . 2.4.6 The Comprehensive Care P lan, Reassessment and PCSM update must be updated e very 90 -120 days at a minimum . Ongoing service goals should carry over to the next Plan, noting that only one to three areas of focus will be included. 2.4.7 Since ongoing primary care and housing instability are key issue s, efforts should continue to concentra te on linking/retaining clients in care and finding permanent housing. 2.4.8 Accompaniment and Health Promotion activities continue as needed and appropriate during this Phase. 2.5 Phase 3: Graduation and Transfer to Supportive Housing or Case Management Program P hase 2.5.1 Occurs months 7-9 2.5.2 Phase 3 focuses on completing the transfer of care to a supportive housing or appropriate case management program that will provide long er- term care coordination support to the client . Entry into and continuity of primary HIV medical care, housing placement and access/enrollment in a case management or supportive housing program are key outcomes of the TCC program. Nine (9) months of continuous enrollment (without disenrollment/reenrollment) is required for graduation. 2.5.2.1 Linkage to a P rimary Care Provider - Selection of a PCP should be done with the transfer activity in mind. Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 11 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control 2.5.2.2 Linkage to Housing Placement Provider - Depending upon client need, the program should focus on finding supportive housing or placing the client in an appropriate level of assistance for independent housing. If the client is eligible for supportive housing, then case management services should be provided by the supportive housing provider. 2.5.2.3 Transfer to Case Management Program - Clients who successfully complete the TCC program must be transferred to supportive housing , Ryan White Part A Care Coordination , Medicaid Health Home, or other case management program (depending on client need) by the end of Phase 3. Program staff must facilitate the transfer. 2.5.3 TCC team should reinforce staff roles and expectations, reminding client and service providers that face- to-face contact will dramatically decrease in Phase 3. However, the worker will remain supportive of the client by testing the strength of linkages created. 2.5.3.1 Program staff should try to limit communication with clients to no more than once every 3 weeks during this period. 2.5.4 Through coordination with other services providers and support contacts, staff should document the specific ways in which linkages to formal and i nformal supports are (or are not) working. 2.5.5 Accompaniment and Health Promotion activities continue as needed and appropriate during this Phase. A minimum of six (6) unique Health Promotion sessions must be completed during Phases 1- 3 as a graduation require ment. 2.5.6 The Program Director and Transitional Care Coordinator should meet regularly to discuss the plans for transition with the TCC team , other service provider s, and any existing informal community supports . 2.5.7 A final joint transfer -of-care meeting or phone call with client and primary linkages should be convened. 2.5.7.1 TCC staff should solicit feedback from client on experience with the intervention and progress that was made. 2.5.7.2 TCC staff may utilize the TCC Transfer of Care Coordination Form (Appendix W) to facilitate transfer of releases of information, compile provider contact information and the associated follow -up care plans. 2.5.7.3 A prognosis for client's long -term continuity of care and housing stability should be made in the client's progress note (Appendix T). 2.5.8 The Comprehensive Care P lan, Reassessment and PCSM update must be updated every 90- 120 days at a minimum . Ongoing service goals should carry over to the next Plan, noting that only one to three areas of focus will be included. Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 12 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control 2.6 Phase 4: Follow -up Phase 2.6.1 Occurs month 12 (3 months after graduation) 2.6.2 Phase 4 provides follow -up with the client and/or assigned C ase Manager three (3) months after the transition takes place . 2.6.2.1 During the third month after the client is graduated from the TCC program and transferred to a case management program , housing provider, and primary care provider , the Transitional Care Coordinator should follow -up with the appropriate assigned program staff to ensure that the relationship between the client and program is working well. 2.6.2.2 Follow -up conversations with the client and coordination of care with the provider should be documented in the client charts. 2.6.2.3 A prognosis for client's long -term continuity of care and housing stability should be made in the client's closing progress note. 2.6.3 If the client was successfully referred to a housing provider, engaged in the case management program and keeps his/her PCP appointment s, the case can be closed and the client will graduate. 2.6.4 If the client is found to be out of care and/or no longer engaged in case management and/or housing services, re-assess and place into the TCC Phase that best corresponds with the client's needs . 2.7 Limited Services 2.7.1 If at any time, an existing TCC client is receiving active services with a Health Home/ comprehensive case management program , the client is eligible to receive temporary \"limited services\" in the TCC program. \"Active services\" - defined as having received three (3) face- to-face services from a Health Home or a comprehensive case management program within the prev ious three months. \"Temporary\" - defined as up to 6 months (or until the end of the 12 month enrollment period). \"Limited services\" - defined as services that are not provided by a Health Home and/or are essential to client's successful transition, includi ng: o Health Promotion (a.k.a. HIV Self -Management Support); o Linkage to Housing Services; o Comprehensive Care Plan and Reassessment & Updates; o Coordination with Service Providers; and o Post-transfer follow -up. Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 13 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control 3.0 Transitional Care Coordination Service Types 3.1 Section Overview : The program is funded to provide the following services. Descriptions of the service types and the manner in which they are reported to DOHMH/HIVCS are given below. For details on mapping services, please refer to the TCC eSHARE ma pping ( Appendix Y) or access the most recent document in the \"Resources\" tab in eSHARE. 3.2 Targeted Case Finding & Outreach Events 3.2.1 The Outreach Specialist conducts targeted case finding via event - based outreach venues where homeless and unstably -housed indiv iduals reside or congregate, including, but not limited to: Single Room Occupancy (SRO) hotels that house a high proportion of people with HIV ; Food pantries, soup kitchens, or religious institutions that serve homeless individuals; Homeless and domestic v iolence shelters; Syringe exchange programs Drop -in centers and other service centers 3.2.2 The Outreach Specialist(s) conducting a targeted case finding event must make at least 10 contacts OR 3 engagements with potential clients . 3.2.2.1 Contacts are defined as interactions that take place individually or in groups in an attempt to engage potential clients. 3.2.2.2 Engagement is defined as a one- on-one interaction with potential clients in a setting that ensures client privacy and confidentiality, where contact information is shared and referrals for program enrollment are made . 3.2.2.3 Targeted case finding services should include a minimum of two hours per event, and allow an additional three hours for travel/setup time and documentation. Example 1: While conducting a targeted case f inding at an SRO, the Outreach Specialist from Agency A knocks on 15 residents' doors. Of those 15 attempts, 10 residents open their doors (10 contacts) . Example 2: The O utreach Specialist is able to fully describe the TCC program and gather enough information to refer 5 interested clients for enrollment (5 engagements). Example 3: Outreach Specialists from Agency B go out to conduct targeted case finding on a street corner determined to yield many potential TCC clients . However, after the first hour of yie lding only 5 contacts, the outreach team decides to move to a location further down the street where there is slightly heavier foot traffic. The move results in 7 more contacts over Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 14 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control the course of the next hour. In cases similar to this, the Outreach Specialist may record the street outreach in two (or more) separate locations as a single targeted case finding event by aggregating the number of contacts and engagements on one form. 3.2.3 Documentation : In order to report a completed t argeted case finding activity , documentation should contain all required elements from the Anonymous Events Services eSHARE Form (Appendix H) including the total number of contacts and engagements . 3.2.3.1 TCC staff should keep a record of both successful (meeting the 10 contact or 3 engagement threshold) AND unsuccessful targeted case finding activities for purposes of review and quality assurance activities . 3.2.3.2 eSHARE Mapping eSHARE Service Type eSHARE Entry Form Information required in service details (in addition to eSHARE submission requir ed): Group Outreach Anonymous Event Services Indicate the total number of \"engagements\" by summing the number of program referrals. 3.3 Intake Assessment 3.3.1 The program will ensure that an assessment is completed that addresses program eligibility; housing; m edical needs; substance use; mental illness; social ser vice needs; and benefits assessment. 3.3.2 Basic client information is collected using the Client Demographics form (Appendix I). 3.3.3 The program staff conducting the initial intake assessme nt is required to use the intake form ( Appendix I) provided by DOHMH in order to minimize errors in data reporting. 3.3.3.1 TCC staff is encouraged to supplement the DOHMH Intake Assessment with additional questions required by their agencies and relevant assessme nt information (e.g. assessment for domestic violence) . 3.3.4 Documentation : Intake assessment information must be entered into the eSHARE Intake Assessment Form (Appendix J) before any services can be entered on the eSHARE Individual Services Delivered Form (Ap pendix M). The eSHARE Intake Assessment form and the eSHARE Reassessment form are required form s. When the Intake Assessment or Reassessment is completed in eSHARE in real -time with the client present, a form printed from eSHARE and kept in client files is acceptable supporting documentation.

There may be a number of issues to address but it is important to capitalize on the clients' strengths, skill, and interests in order to identify areas they are willing to address. 3.4.1.3 The care plan must have the written consent of the client and signature of the Transitional Care Coordinator. Every item on the service plan must be assigned a target date of completion and anticipated resources required. 3.4.1.4 Time Requirement: The care plan is usually completed in conjunction with the initial intake assessment. At minimum, the care plan should be completed within thirty (30) business days of program enrollment . 3.4.2 Documentation: A completed C omprehensive Care Plan Development service should be reported in eSHARE under \"Care Plan / Service Plan\" in the \"Services Delivered\" form. eSHARE Mapping eSHARE Service Type eSHARE Entry Form Information required in service details (in addition to eSHARE submission required) : Care Plan / Service plan Services Delivered Service detail must specify \"Development of initial plan with this enrollment .\" Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 16 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control 3.5 Reassessment 3.5.1 Program st aff will meet with the client to conduct a reassessment every 90- 120 days during enrollment to coincide with Phase transitions . 3.5.2 Documentation : Reassessment information must be entered into the eSHARE Reassessment Form (Appendix P) before any services can be entered on the eSHARE Individual Services Delivered Form (Appendix M) .

When such duplication is discovered, the TCC p rogram and the provider of the other services should discuss with the recipient which agency best suits his or her needs. 6.2.4.3 Programs will collaborate and coordinate with other care coordination agencies to ensure that people with HIV persons receive c omprehensive, non- duplicative \u2014but complementary \u2014 services. People with HIV with numerous complex social and/or health/mental health needs will be referred to other agencies that target those specific issues and c oordination of services will continue. 6.2.5 The Transitional Care Coordinator will obtain a signed Agreement from the client for release of HIV information and for Program enrollment. 6.2.6 The initial intake assessment process addresses the logistics of care coordination, which includes: 6.2.6.1 Family or social network available to provide support in helping the client meet his/her healthcare needs. 6.2.6.2 Childcare responsibilities impacting daily routine. 6.2.6.3 Client 's preferred language. 6.2.6.4 Outstanding criminal justice issues (parole, etc.). 6.2.6.5 General or health literacy impediments. 6.2.6.6 Social barriers to delivering services in the home such as the risk of family violence. 6.2.7 Ensure appropriate and complete contact information is on record (including a contact number where the client can be reac hed during business hours, cell phone, home number, etc.) and a friend or support contact that will know the client s whereabouts and can be contacted in the event that communication with the client is impossible. A client c ontact information form should be used to document this information ( Appendix L). Find out if the client's HIV status has been disclosed to this person and use appropriate confidentiality procedures. 6.2.8 Clients referred through a source other than the affiliated medical provider should have a primary care appointment scheduled as soon as possible. 6.2.9 Explain the importance of notifying the TCC p rogram and PCP in the event of a hospitalization or travel. 6.2.10 Screen for and address needs such as domestic violence and mental illness . 6.2.11 Timeline : the inta ke process should preferably be started at the time of client enrollment and with the client present. The intake process should be Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 30 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control initiated (e.g., readiness for program assessed, contact information obtained) within one business day of the referral's rece ipt. If time allows , a comprehensive Intake Assessment should be done at that time; if sufficient time is not available, an appointment should be made to complete the intake and assessment within seven (7) business days. 6.2.12 Preventing Further HIV Transmission in the context of HIV Care: 6.2.12.1 Condoms and information on licensed needle exchange programs should be available to client s as necessary (e.g., Outreach Specialists conducting safer sex education in the field should carry condoms to freely distribute to clien ts). 6.2.12.2 A regularly updated list of licensed needle exchange programs in NYC is available through the following link: http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/basas/syringe_exchan ge.pdf 6.2.12.3 If a client discloses that they have an HIV negative sex and/or needle sharing partner, the Program should inform the client about their options regarding partner notification. 6.2.12.4 Client s are not required to give the name(s) of their partner(s) to their doctor or disclose their HIV status to anyone. 6.2.12.5 Client s interested in receiving help notifying their partner(s) may be referred to: NYC DOHMH Contact Notification Assistance Program at (212) 693- 1419 or 311 and ask for CNAP HIV Epidemiology and F ield Services Unit (FSU) at (212) 442 - 6577. 6.2.12.6 Please be aware that for clients experiencing intimate partner violence, partner notification may not be an option. 6.2.13 Housing needs assessment : 6.2.13.1 Staff must evaluate all enrollees with regard to their housing st atus. 6.2.13.2 A quick verification of last recorded address and stability of the housing arrangement takes place at the time of every face - to-face meeting when possible. 6.2.13.3 Clients should be referred to a housing provider to help find a permanent housing placement. I f a permanent placement is not possible, transitional housing may be pursued. 6.2.13.4 If the client is living in a SRO, the TCC staff should assess how long the client has been living there and if they have a desire to move to a m ore permanent living situation. If yes, proceed as above. 6.3 Conducting the Rea ssessment 6.3.1 The Program will conduct a reassessment and update the Comprehensive C are Plan at least once every 90-120 days . Providers are required to use the eSHARE Reassessment form (Appendix P) provided by Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 31 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control DOHMH. Regular assessment of HIV risk behavior is necessary as an individual's social and environmental situations often change. Regular assessment of client eligibility criteria is necessary because clients may experience a change in income, residency , and/or enrollment in a Health Home or other case management program. 6.3.2 If at reassessment a client is found to be enrolled in a Health Home or other case management program, TCC staff should refer to Section 5.2 (Medicaid Health Homes and TCC Dual Enrollment) of th e TCC Program Manual 3.0 for guidance regarding dual enrollment. Individuals who are enrolled in a Health Home/ comprehensive case management program AND receiving active services are eligible for temporary (up to 6 months or until the end of the 12 month enrollment period) limited services through the TCC Program (see 2.7) . 7.0 Case Suspension and Closure 7.1 Overview: 7.1.1 Program must develop and maintain a policy/procedure for case suspensions and closures. 7.1.2 Case suspensions and cl osures should be documented in eSHARE and may be reflected on the Status Change Information Form (Appendix R). 7.2 Case Suspension 7.2.1 Any anticipated or actual absence from the program or community linkages for more than one (1) month should lead to the client 's suspension (with the start date being whenever they became inactive, e.g., became incarcerated, moved into in- patient care or could otherwise not be reached for services). Suspension should be done at the time the program learns of the patient's move and/ or absence. Enrollment may be suspended in eSHARE and easily resumed/reactivated without re- enrolling . 7.2.1.1 For c lients who have not responded to all efforts of outreach by the Program or the community linkages for at least two (2) sequential months without suc cessful contact, the suspension start date begins at the completion of outreach follow -up activities. 7.3 Case Closure 7.3.1 Reason for case closure must be documented in client records, and must correspond with reasons for case clos ure as structured in eSHARE . In addition, discharge planning and/or outreach to clients lost to follow -up must be implemented and documented when appropriate. Reasons for closure may include: Client has accomplished goals of his or her service plan with no new needs identified, Client moved/relocated, Client requested transfer to another provider, Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 32 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Client incarcerated or institutionalized for a certain number of months , Client lost to follow up/unsuccessful reengagement efforts for over a period of one, but not to exceed nine months Client tested HIV negative and do not demonstrate high risk behaviors (for programs funded to identify or test clients at -risk for HIV) Client died 7.3.2 Graduation 7.3.2.1 In order to graduate from the TCC program, client s must complete all requirements set forth in S ection 3. 14. 7.3.2.2 Client is closed in eSHARE upon completion of the 4- month follow -up on community linkages with care providers. 7.3.3 Voluntary withdrawal or refusal of treatment 7.3.3.1 A client may refuse further service at any time. 7.3.3.2 When client s are not ready for graduation, the P rogram staff must inquire why the client wishes to terminate services and recommend remaining in the p rogram. 7.3.3.3 If an attempt to encourage continued engagement with the client is not successful, the Program should : Notify the HIV PCP of the de cision ; Dis-enroll the client from the TCC p rogram; Document the reason for closing the case on the Status Change Information Form (Appendix R); Close the enrollment in eSHARE; Offer a referral to another program, as appropriate. 7.3.3.4 Lateral transfer - A client may request transfer to another Transitional C are Coordination program. The TCC program transferring the client must: Obtain consent for sharing information; Prepare a copy of the TCC records ; Arrange for referral to the new TCC program ; Send copy of T CC records to the new Program 7.3.4 Client not benefiting from program 7.3.4.1 If the client is not benefiting from enrollment in the Program , not improving, or not adherent with the plan, the Program may dis -enroll the client and refer to a more appropriate program such as drug treatment, residential care or adult day care. Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 33 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control 7.3.5 Lost to follow -up 7.3.5.1 Lost to follow -up occurs when all efforts have been made and client s have not been located after two (2) sequential months of outreach. 7.3.5.2 At program discretion, the enrollment may be suspended or closed. 7.3.6 Permanently unable to participate 7.3.6.1 Close the client in eSHARE if the client is permanently unable to participate .

DOHMH will conduct a client record review, including an in- depth review of client charts. 11.3.2 DOHMH will meet with key program staff to discuss programmatic performance. Topics covered include, but are not limited to: Quality management (QM plan and QI project); Data review; Case Finding; Documentation; eSHARE; and Training needs. 11.3.3 DOHMH will incorporate fidelity assessment into the joint site visit in lieu of formal self-assessment and alignment plan activities. Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 36 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control APPENDICES Appendix A - Definitions Accompaniment: An activity designed to increase adherence to a client 's treatment plan . For example, a n Outreach Specialist accompanies the client from his/her home to medical appointments. If the home is not a suitable location because of safety, disclosure concerns, or other obstacles, the accompaniment originates at an alternative, mutually - agreed upon location in the community (e.g. somewhere the client hangs out, the client 's favorite park, or other set location near his /her home or work). Accompaniment is intended for high- risk people with HIV who struggle with conventional treatment regimens, and the intent is that even in circumstances where the client is ambivalent about following through with the appointment, the Outreach Specialist can reasonably find him or her. The goal is to provide social support (and advocacy if indicated) and help the client connect to medical care, housing and social services in order to improve clients' health outcomes and reduce rates of hospitalization. 9 Active Services: Defined as a client having received three (3) or more face- to-face services from a Health Home or a comprehensive case management program within the previous three months. Benefits: Publicly -funded services administered by local, State or Federal government to assist certain families or individuals in need. Services or cash assistance may include social security, Medicaid or Medicare, food stamps , or housing assistance. Care Coordination: The deliberate integration of care activities between two or more participants (including the client ) involved in a client 's care t o facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services, as defined by McDonald et al. 10 The opposite of care coordination is fragmentation of care, which is often seen when the relationship between a single practitioner and a client does not extend b eyond specific episodes of illness or disease.11 Case Management: A collaborative process of assessment , planning, facilitation and advocacy for options and services to meet an individual's health needs through 9 Behforouz HL, Farmer PE , Mukherjee JS.

Program Directors should perform a case review in a summary fashion for every client at least once per quarter. Concerns or determinations arising from either of these case reviews should be brought to case conference with the rest of the team. Case Conference : An interdisciplinary meeting during which all Transitional Care Coordination team members involved in providing care to the client (e.g., Program Director, Transitional Care Coordinator, Outreach Specialist) participate and contribute to the process of reviewing documentation and developing the care plan for a client . Each client should be discussed at a case conference before transition to a mainstream case management or supportive housing program. Client Advocacy : The act of speaking on behalf of client s in order to protect their rights and help them obtain needed information, services and benefits (including medical, social, legal, and financial). Advocacy does not include coordination and follow -up of medical treatments. Advocacy should be done as part of case management activities in an effort to build upon cooperation and collaboration among providers. Comprehensive Care Plan : A written plan developed by the client 's Transitional Care Coordination t eam in order to achieve the client 's goals. This plan focuses on a few key areas, including housing stability, coordination of care, and health promotion activities . The care plan identifies action steps , responsible parties, and targeted dates for each pl anned activity to ensure care plan adherence. TCC program staff completing the care plan should check for understanding/agreement and obtain the client's signature. Comprehensive Care Plan Update : Once the initial care plan is developed, the Transitional Care C oordination team should continue to monitor the client 's progress toward their goals. At a minimum, care plans should be updated every 90-120 days and ideally coincide with a client's movement to the next TCC Phase. Clients should also be reassessed upon re- opening/re- enrollment in order to determine their TCC Phase and identify any new needs/goals. Critical Time Intervention: CTI is an empirically supported case management model originally designed to prevent homelessness in people with severe ment al illness during the period following discharge from hospitals, shelters, prisons, and other institutions 13. CTI experts worked in partnership with NYC DOHMH to develop TCC for people with HIV who are homeless or unstably housed 12 What is a Case Manager? page.

The level of health promotion interventions will vary according to the client 's intensity of needs. Homeless: The term \"homeless\" is used to define individuals who: lack a regular and/or adequate nighttime residence; have a pr imary nighttime resi dence that is a public or private shelter or dwelling designed to provide temporary living accommodations, including SROs; live in an institution that provides temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutio nalized; or live in a public or private place not i ntended or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. Interdisciplinary Team : A team that includes professionals representing the disciplines required for a comprehensive approach to meeting the needs of the client . At a minimum, in the first two P hases , the team consists of the Transitional Care Coordinator and Outreach Specialist . However , the clinical provider and housing coordinator may also be included if applicable. By P hase 3, the team should include the case manager and all other relevant formal linkages in the community . 14 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 39 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Limited Services: Defined as services that are not provided by a Health Home /comprehensive case management program and/or are essential to client's successful transition, including: Health Promotion (a.k.a. HIV Self -Management Support); Linkage to Housing Services; Comprehensive Care Plan and Reassessment & Updates; Coordination with Service Providers; and Post -transfer follow -up. Logistical Support: T he provision or arrangement of necessary services and resources in order to carry out the care plan including transportation and childcare services. Other factors that must be taken into consideration for the delivery of the care plan include health litera cy, client 's preferred language and social barriers (e.g., family violence). Medical Case Management: The Health Resources and Services Administration ( HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) 18 defines medical case management19 as \"a range of client - centered services that link client s with health care, psychosocial, and other services. Coordination and follow -up of medical treatments are components of medical case management. Services ensure timely, coordinated access to medically appropriate levels of health and su pport services and continuity of care through ongoing assessment of client s' and key family members' needs and personal support systems. The service includes treatment adherence counseling to ensure readiness for and adherence to complex HIV/AIDS regimens. Key activities include (1) initial assessment of service needs; (2) development of comprehensive, individualized service plan; (3) coordination of services required to implement the plan; (4) client monitoring to assess the efficacy of the plan; and (5) periodic reevaluation and adaptation of the plan as necessary over the life of the client . It includes all types of case management, including face- to-face meetings, phone contact, and any other forms of communication.\" Medical Treatment Plan Adherence: Adherence to all medical appointments and referrals and obtaining lab tests/imaging when ordered. This is distinct from medication adherence described below. Medication Adherenc e: Adherence to the recommended treatment regimen by taking all prescribed me dications. Medication adherence is described quantitatively as percentage of medication doses divided by dose prescribed taken over a period. Specific interventions are used to improve adherence. Motivational Interviewing: Motivational interviewing (MI ) is a counseling style that is collaborative and person- centered. The goal of MI is to help clients explore and resolve ambivalence in order to change unhealthy or problematic health behaviors regarding their HIV care and treatment . Practitioners are care ful to avoid arguments and confrontation with clients, which tend to decrease their motivation for change and increase their defensiveness and resistance. 18 Refer to http://hab.hrsa.gov/publications/november2008/November08.pdf Accessed December 8, 2008. 19 The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act (HATMA) of 2006 changed to include medical case management as a core service. Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 40 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Navigation Model: The navigat ion model aims to advocate for, communicate with, and identify resourc es for the client, thereby coordinating the complex health care and social services necessary to ensure improved client outcomes. TCC program staff generally focuses on empowering the individual requiring services, rather than attempting to change the heal th care system as a whole. The model also includes active discussion and education, empowerment and encouragement. Out of care : A term used to define client s who have received primary care services with a provider within the last two years and have not been seen in primary care for the past nine months at that specific facility . Primary Care Provider: The primary medical provider (physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) responsible for the client 's comprehensive HIV medical treatment. Supportive Housing: Supportive Housing is defined as affordable scattered- site or congregate housing with the provision of comprehensive supportive services to eligible persons who face multiple barriers in their ability to maintain housing stability. Supporti ve housing is classified as either permanent or temporary. Permanent housing is intended to be long -term and continued occupancy is expected. Temporary housing is intended to be short -term and no longer than two years. TCC Phase 0: Outreach: This pre- program phase focuses on targeted case finding and referral to and coordination of HIV testing. Once clients are engaged, confirmed HIV - positive, and referred to the program, they will move to Phase 1. TCC Phase 1: Transition (Months 1 -3): The purpose of thi s Phase is to provide intensive support and assess the client 's resources that exist for the eventual transition of car e to both formal and informal supports in the client's community/network . Development of a housing plan should begin in this phase as client s must be connected to a housing placement provider in order to graduate from the TCC program. Linkage to a primary care provider should be prioritized for clients who are not connected to care. TCC Phase 2: Try-Out (Months 4 -6): This Phase is devoted to testing and adjusting the systems of support that were developed in Phase 1. Contact and introductions should be made with a Ryan White Part A medical case management program or other case management program (depending on client's needs) to begin discus sion of the client 's transition and to introduce the client to the selected provider (s). TCC Phase 3: Graduation and Transfer of Care (Months 7 -9): Phase 3 focuses on completing the transfer of care to a medical provider, housing program, and case managem ent or supportive housing program. This P hase may be repeated if any portion is not successfully completed by the client. Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 41 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control TCC Phase 4: Follow -up (Month 12): The final phase involves a follow -up with the client and/or case manager during the third month after the transition takes place to confirm the continued linkage. . Client s who have fallen out of care can re- enter the program at Phase 2 or 3 upon reassessment and completion of an updated care plan. Unstably Housed: Expands on the definition of \"homeless\" (see above) to also include individuals who frequently move between housing situations, individuals who are facing eviction, and/or individuals who are temporarily living with family or friends. Quality Management : A method of program/service improvement, which is designed to assure that the highest quality of service, is provided. Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 42 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Appendix B - Access -A-Ride The MTA New York City Access -A-Ride (AAR) program provides transportation for persons with disability who are unable to use public bus or subway services. This program offers shared ride, door-to-door paratransit service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in all five boroughs of New York City. In order to participate in this program, applicants must be assessed by a healthcare professional and i f appropriate, undergo functional testing at a Transit Office Assessment Center. The certifier will send their assessment report to the Transit Office, who will notify the applicant of their decision within 21 days. If an applicant is denied eligibility or given conditional eligibility, they have a right to appeal the decision within 60 days of notification. Although most AAR customers need to be recertified every five years, those customers whose disability is unlikely to improve or for whom their disabili ty will become more severe, can simply update their information in lieu of this process. Once approved for the AAR program, customers can call the Paratransit Reservations Office one to two days in advance of their trip to make a reservation. Furthermor e, for those customers who travel from the same location to the same destination at the same time of day for each trip, can arrange a subscription service and will only need to call if they would like to cancel their trip. Finally, customers pay for their trip the same fare they would pay on mass transit (i.e., exact change or TransitCheck coupons). Customers may be accompanied by one paying guest, as well as a personal care attendant (who rides free of charge), if needed and pre- approved by the Transit Office. The role of the Transitional Care Coordination Program would be to assist people with HIV with the following tasks: Applying and recertifying enrollment in the AAR program Appealing New York City Transit Office decisions Determining if a personal care attendant (relative, spouse, friend, or a professional attendant) is needed during travel Creating and canceling AAR reservations and subscriptions Additional information about the AAR program can be found at : http://www.mta.info/nyct/paratran/guide.htm Transitional Care Coordination Program Manual Version 3 .0 Revised F ebruary 2014 Page 43 of 115 DOHMH Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Appendix C - Childcare Services This section clarifies what is required of entities providing childcare services in New York City. --- Any entity providing child supervision servi ces at the same location where the client is receiving funded services does not have to apply for and receive a child care permit from New York City, pursuant to NYC Code 47.01(c)(2)(E). This exemption applies to any medical or social service provider providing child care to children of client s receiving medical case management services at the same premises. The medical or social service provider would fall under the definition of \"Other Business\". In order to meet this exemption criterion, both of the f ollowing must be met: 1. The parent/guardian must remain at the same address as the site where the child care is being provided. 2. A particular child does not spend more than 8 hours per week in care. --- If a client is receiving medical case management s ervices at a medical provider, the funded program can provide daycare services at the client 's home while the client is receiving services without a childcare permit as allowed under State regulation 18 NYC RR 415.1(2)(i) This would be classified as a \"Leg ally Exempt In -Home Child Care Service\" . In order to meet this criterion, the following must be met: 1. Child care must be furnished in the child's own home by a caregiver who is chosen and monitored by the child's caretaker. 2. The caregiver must be at least 18 years of age, or less than 18 years of age and meets the requirements for the employment of minors as set forth in article 4 of the New York State Labor Law; provided, however, that the child's caretaker must provide the caregiver with all employment benefits required by State and/or Federal law, and must pay the caregiver at least the minimum wage, if required. --- Any entity providing child supervision services must obtain a permit if the child care took place at a location other than where the parent/guardian is receiving services.
