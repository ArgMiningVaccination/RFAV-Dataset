The Summe r School is intended to provide students and early career scientists with information on in vitro, in silico, and human -based methods and approaches for toxicology and biomedical research. The free, fully online program will feature lectures, in -depth trai ning, virtual laboratory tours, e -poster presentations, and virtual engagement with speakers and attendees. Featured speakers include experts from Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, the National Institutes of Health, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, and more. You are encouraged to apply to the Summer School to participate in the full program including panels, lab tours and demos, networking, and mentoring sessions, by submitting a short appli cation. Attendees who participate in the full Summer School are eligible for poster and participation awards and will receive a certificate for their involvement. Anyone at any career stage is welcome to participate in individual training or lecture sessio ns via Zoom. Registration for individual sessions is available on the program page . Deadline to apply for the full program is June 10 . Deadline to register for individual lectures and trainings is June 19 . Featured Scientific Articles Check out this month's featured articles to learn more about new human - relevant re search scientists are currently conducting. EURL ECVAM Recomm endation on Non -Animal -Derived Antibodies The European Union Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL ECVAM) released its recommendation to end the use of animals in antibody production. Endorsed by their Scientific Advisory Committee, researchers found that animal -free technologies produce affinity reagents with equal or better quality than that offered by antibodies produced using the conventional animal -based methods Modeling the Human Bone -Tumor Niche: Reducing and Repl acing the Need for Animal Data Rao SR, Edwards CM, Edwards JR.
