Take a look under my kitchen sink and you'll find a jumble of bottles and jars with colorful graphics, along with a bunch of random sponges and [reusable cleaning cloths](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=279839&clickref=&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F115126664%2Fpaperless-towels-unpaper-towels-reusable) - just like most people. Unlike most people, instead of the traditional cleaning products that were always under the sink when I was growing up, I've filled mine with newer brands (+ a homemade version), made with safe, non-toxic ingredients. Switching out my cleaning products was one of first steps I took to [detox my home by switching to natural, non-toxic products](https://mindfulmomma.com/buy-natural-non-toxic-products/) many years ago, but believe me, it did not happen overnight. It's been a process, and sometimes a challenge to find cleaning products that work well and are not simply greenwashing disguised as natural. Today we're talking about the most basic of cleaning products - but probably the one you use most often: the all-purpose cleaning spray. Over the years, I've had many different all-purpose cleaning sprays under my sink, but only a handful that make it back time after time. Find out which ones made the cut (+ a few that didn't ) and why below! Why It Matters Aside from your garage or basement storage room, the worst chemicals in your home are probably underneath your kitchen and bathroom sinks. The chemicals in those products may be good for scrubbing but they are not healthy housemates. Most traditional cleaning products contain active ingredients and fragrances that are linked to asthma, allergies, hormone disruption and even cancer. In fact, many popular cleaning sprays - like [Lysol](http://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/1116-LYSOLCompleteCleanAllPurposeCleanerSprayLemonBreeze#.Wdum1WhSyUk) and [Formula 409](http://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/2962-Formula409AntibacterialAllPurposeCleanerSpray#.WduoFGhSyUk) rate an F (the worst rating) on EWG's Guide to Healthy Cleaning. Trust me, you do not want to be spraying those things around for your family to breathe! Conventional cleaning products aren't good for the environment either - the ingredients cause harm to marine life and drinking water, and continue our reliance on petroleum. Think reading the label will help you identify safer products? Sadly that's not the case for most cleaning products. Unlike food or beauty products, manufacturers of household cleaning products are not required to list ingredients on the label. And from what we've learned here, those \"patented\" cleaning formulas are secret for a reason. Criteria for Non-Toxic Cleaning Sprays So now that we know why we should avoid traditional cleaning sprays, let's figure out how to find safer ones! These are the things I look for in an all-purpose cleaning spray: - Transparency - all ingredients listed on packaging - Plant derived - ingredients from plants instead of petroleum - Free from - parabens, phthalates, tricolsan, 1,4 dioxane, phosphates, synthetic dyes, synthetic fragrances, harsh solvents, VOCs - Biodegradable - all ingredients will biodegrade completely - Cruelty free - no animal testing - Light natural scent or unscented - some \"natural\" brands like Mrs. Meyers and Method have scents that are too overpowering for my liking Favorite Non-Toxic Cleaning Sprays (There are affiliate links in this post.

Like I said, finding non-toxic cleaning sprays that actually work well has been a process. So to keep you from having to go through those same trials, I'm only sharing the all-purpose cleaning sprays that I have liked enough to repurchase over and over again. I love these brands! And if you're a DIY'er you'll be happy to see my homemade cleaning spray on the list!
