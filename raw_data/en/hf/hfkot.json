Nursing a burnout with a bad back for more than a couple of months, I discovered and checked into PEMA for three weeks (!) hoping for a miracle. I was in the right place. After approximately 15 acupuncture sessions, more than 30 massage therapies, 40 sessions of yoga (including the brilliant laughing yoga!), meditation, yog nidra and, and this is a big AND, 12000 calories (total in 22 days) of exquisite, stylish vegan food (the vegan was my choice, else it's vegetarian), I felt human once again. And lighter, in body and importantly in mind.

I was suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis from last 2 years. The symptoms are : Swelling in the legs Pain in Joints And further on inability to move Cardio problems My C Reactive Protein was 80 for 2 years ( normal limit being 5) And I had consulted all the topmost RA Doctors in India and abroad, but in vain! I was put on steroids which though cured my CRP, and brought it down to 20, but that was not the ultimate cure. As soon as my steroids would be stopped, CRP would shoot up again.

I went recently to the resort. I thought it was very well designed, cleanliness. You get some massages that are not found in India (sand massage which helps your hands become more clean). The view is so beautiful that you can see the beach there. The yoga instructors especially Puneet, Dheeraj, Veeraswamy is also good. They also provide one on one class for yoga if you need it. You just have to pay extra. That depends on each person. Read more Date of stay: February 2019 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
