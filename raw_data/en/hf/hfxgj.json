Here's how much protein pregnant women need and how to get enough.", "sitename": "WhattoExpect", "date": "2021-11-08", "cleaned_text": "It's no secret that our bodies require an adequate amount of protein to fulfill basic functions like muscle growth, wound healing and cell signaling \u2014 and protein is especially important when you're expecting. This macronutrient is an essential source of energy that repairs parts of the body like Mom's brain, muscle and the blood, all of which undergo normal changes during pregnancy. Getting the right amount of protein in your diet also gives your little one the fuel she needs to grow. Read on to learn how much protein expecting moms need, whether protein powder is safe during pregnancy and the best protein-rich foods to prioritize when you're pregnant. Why is protein so important during pregnancy? Protein is an [essential nutrient during pregnancy](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/diet/pregnancy-nutrition-chart/#protein). The building blocks of protein, called amino acids, play countless roles in the body, from maintaining the structure of our muscles, skin and bones to producing critical hormones for growth. Eating enough protein during pregnancy also supports your baby's development, since amino acids are required for normal cell growth and function. Meeting your daily protein needs may also lower the risk of complications like fetal growth restriction and preterm labor. How much protein do pregnant women need? Most moms-to-be meet their protein needs without even realizing it. The amount of protein you should eat while pregnant depends on a few different factors, such as how far along you are, your physical activity and your weight, but aiming for about 71 grams per day is a good goal. To estimate your daily needs, divide your pre-pregnancy weight by two, and always confirm with your practitioner (for example, a pregnant woman who weighs 150 pounds might need around 75 grams of protein a day). While eating a well-balanced diet can provide enough protein for many moms-to-be, you should also take a [prenatal vitamin](//www.whattoexpect.com/baby-products/pregnancy/best-prenatal-vitamins-buy-over-counter/) throughout pregnancy. Prenatals act like an insurance policy so your baby gets all the nutrients she needs for healthy development. Read This Next Keep in mind that while it's important to get enough protein when you're expecting, you should avoid [low-carb, Keto or Paleo diets](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/your-health/keto-diet-pregnancy). Consuming too-few carbs during pregnancy can leave you short on vital vitamins and minerals that are found in grains, fruits and vegetables, and pack more protein than your body needs. Is protein powder safe during pregnancy? If you're looking for easy ways to bump up your protein intake during pregnancy, supplements like protein powders might sound like a simple fix. But if you're adding these supplements to your diet on top of a variety of protein-rich foods as well as your prenatal, you may actually get too much. Protein powders and other supplements often contain a whopping amount of protein in a concentrated form, and since research shows that excessive protein intake during pregnancy can be detrimental, it's all about finding a happy medium. And remember: Supplements aren't regulated by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), so it's difficult to know exactly what's inside that protein powder, and even the ingredients that are listed on the label may not be 100 percent safe during pregnancy. Unlike whole food sources of protein like fresh chicken or eggs, protein powders can contain trace amounts of heavy metals, caffeine or herbs like gingko that may render the supplement unsafe for expecting moms. That can be true of all forms of protein powder (such as whey, pea and chickpea) as well as protein bars, energy bars and shakes (which can also contribute to gastrointestinal discomfort during pregnancy). Bottom line? It's better to get your protein fix through real foods, and as with all vitamins and supplements in pregnancy, you should never take anything without first discussing it with your practitioner.
