Autistic people may find the process of getting the vaccination stressful. These social scripts provide autistic people with an opportunity to prepare themselves for their vaccination and reduce anxiety. Social scripts are story-based strategies using images and descriptions to explain new experiences and social environments to autistic people. Social scripts often include very specific and illustrated information about what an autistic person can expect. While the social scripts have been developed for autistic people, anyone who is feeling anxious about the process of getting a COVID-19 vaccination can use and benefit from the resources. Despite every vaccination centre location and GP clinic being different, the script's contents can be applied to any situation where someone is receiving a COVID-19 vaccination, as the process is consistent across Australia. Some tips for using the social scripts are: We have social scripts available in other languages for vaccination clinics, low-sensory vaccination clinics, and drive through vaccination clinics. Whilst many of these centres are no longer open, we think they can still be useful because many of the steps of the vaccination process, no matter the location, are similar.
