Certainly, I'm not the first to have thought of this by any stretch of the imagination, but over the last 13 years, I've become convinced that it is a fear of bodily \"contamination\" that harks back to ideas found in many religions. Think about it. Where does the fear of \"toxins\" in vaccines come from? Vaccines are portrayed as \"foreign,\" as something \"unnatural\" that is \"injected right into the bloodstream.\" Never mind that vaccines are not injected directly into... [Dumb and dumber: Kent Heckenlively and Mike Adams team up to support an antivaccine WhiteHouse.gov petition](/insolence/2017/08/08/dumb-and-dumber-kent-heckenlively-and-mike-adams-team-up-to-support-an-antivaccine-whitehouse-gov-petition) Yesterday was a busy day for a number of reasons. I thought of skipping it, but I couldn't resist taking notice of one particularly hilarious bit that I found on what is perhaps the wretchedest of all the wretched hives of scum and quackery on the Internet, NaturalNews.com. There, yesterday, on a very special day for me, I saw this headline by Mike Adams: Facebook blocks all Natural News article posts to 2.2M fans after site posts White House petition citing immunization dangers: In the latest outrageous example of total censorship against the independent media, Facebook has blocked nearly... [The violent rhetoric of the antivaccine movement: \"Vaccine Holocaust\" and potential impending attacks on journalists](/insolence/2017/05/17/the-violent-rhetoric-of-the-antivaccine-movement-vaccine-holocaust-and-potential-impending-attacks-on-journalists) After yesterday's post about how antivaxers were utterly losing their mind about an ill-chosen idiom that appeared in a Boston Herald editorial last week. In it, the editor concluded by saying that how antivaxers have been preying on the Somali immigrant population in Minnesota, feeding them antivaccine misinformation that has resulted in two measles outbreaks, one in 2011 and one this year, which is up to 58 victims, a number that continues to climb, should be a \"hanging offense.\" In my post, I emphasized the hypocrisy and disingenuousness of the response of antivaxers, who took an offhand... [The annals of \"I'm not antivaccine,\" part 24: Antivaxers threaten to dox Boston Herald employees over the newspaper's use of imagery much less offensive than what antivaxers use on a daily basis](/insolence/2017/05/16/the-annals-of-im-not-antivaccine-part-24-violent-imagery-for-me-but-not-for-thee) Over the last few years, I've been doing a recurring series that I like to refer to as The Annals of \"I'm not antivaccine.\" Amazingly, it's already up to part 23. It's a series based on an oft-repeated antivaccine claim that is either a like or a delusion (sometimes both), namely the claim made by antivaccine activists ranging from Jenny McCarthy to Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the latter of whom is best known for making such claims after likening \"vaccine-induced autism\" to the Holocaust. (Indeed, RFK, Jr. takes denial to a ridiculous extreme by proclaiming himself not just \"pro-vaccine\" but \"... I've been at this blogging thing for well over 12 years now. I know, I know. Sometimes it amazes even me that I been doing this so long. I also know that I've been mentioning just how long I've been blogging more frequently. Sometimes I worry that the blog will turn into nothing more than posts counting down the days since I started this whole crazy thing. Of course, the main reason I mention this is not so much out of a desire for repetition but as a way of expressing amazement when I find something new and/for bizarre that I don't recall having heard before. So it was when I came across an... Way back in the early days of my blogging career, I remember coming across a \"challenge\" by a man named Jock Doubleday. I didn't know it at the time, but Doubleday had achieved some notoriety before his \"vaccine challenge\" as the director or Natural Woman, Natural Man, Inc. and the author of such amazing works as The Burning Time (Stories of the Modern-day Persecution of Midwives) and Lolita Shrugged (THE MYTH OF AGE-SPECIFIC MATURITY). His \"challenge\" was in the same vein as his previous work, only more so and full-on antivaccine. The reason I'm bringing up Doubleday again after all these... [Google delists Mike Adams' NaturalNews.com. His hilarious tantrum about the \"conspiracy\" behind it is epic, as is my schadenfreude.](/insolence/2017/02/23/google-delists-mike-adams-his-hilarious-tantrum-about-the-conspiracy-behind-it-is-epic-as-is-my-schadenfreude) Regular readers here are probably familiar with Mike Adams and his website NaturalNews.com. Forget the antivaccine crank blog Age of Autism, when it comes to wretched hives of scum and quackery on the Internet, NaturalNews is the wretchedest, scummiest, and quackiest. Not surprisingly, Adams got his start in wingnuttery selling Y2K scams nearly 18 years ago. Now, besides presiding over a scammy online publishing empire that racks in considerable green by publishing articles laced with quackery, antivaccine pseudoscience, character assassination, and thuggery, both legal and getting a bit too... I wasn't planning on revisiting this topic, but sometimes a blogger's gotta do what a blogger's gotta do. You'll see what I mean in a minute. But before you do, I'll just provide a bit of background. Last week, I came across one of those truly awful antivaccine studies that gets the old Insolence flowing, this time a mix of the Respectful and not-so-Respectful. I'm referring, of course, to a paper that I came across as I was spending some time delving into the deeper darker parts of antivaccine social media. It was a study by Antonietta Gatti and Stefano Montanari in the International Journal... John Weeks has long been an activist for alternative medicine\u2014excuse me, \"complementary and alternative medicine\" (CAM) or, as it's more commonly referred to these days, \"integrative medicine.\" Despite his having zero background in scientific research or the design and execution of experiments and clinical trials, for some bizarre reason in May he was appointed editor of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine (JACM). It didn't take him long at all to use his new post to launch a nasty broadside against CAM critics in general (such as yours truly) and those who criticized a... I've not written about this election believing the flaws of the Republican candidate were pretty obvious; further litigating his failures as a candidate is now moot, he is now the president-elect of the United States. However, it is worth discussing what this administration will now bring given what we know about how conspiracy theorists behave and I believe our experience with conspiracy theorists and denialists gives some insight into what we can expect from a conspiracy theorist (CT) politician. There are some questions that may be answered and may help the scientific community develop... In the early days of 2016, my attention was drawn to a local antivaccine doctor of whom I'd heard before but never really paid much attention to. What caught my eye was a blog exchange between this \"holistic\" family practitioner and former Scienceblogs blogger, friend, and local internist Peter Lipson over this physician's blog posts attacking a local Jewish summer camp for children for its new requirement that campers must be up to date on their vaccinations as a requirement for attending. Not surprisingly, Dr. Lipson took the side of science and refuted the antivaccine nonsense that had... [A \"natural health\" huckster offers to help the victims of a cancer fraudster by giving them his supplements for free. It doesn't go so well.](/insolence/2016/06/29/a-huckster-is-rebuffed-by-the-victims-of-a-cancer-fraudster-hilarity-ensues) Forgive me, dear readers. Ever since Mike Adams, the crank who runs and \"alternative health\" empire and a website with as much traffic as the NIH website, started targeting me two months ago with a series of libelous posts, I haven't mentioned him much, for the simple reason that I don't want to drive any traffic his way. Also, after his having posted 25(!) articles targeting me over the last two months, the most recent just this weekend, I realized that addressing him directly is too much like wrestling a pig in mud. You get dirty, and the pig likes it. However, yesterday, Adams outdid... [The conspiracy circle is complete: Brian Hooker claims \"The Man\" has gotten to the \"CDC whistleblower\"](/insolence/2016/04/26/the-conspiracy-circle-is-complete-brian-hooker-claims-the-man-has-gotten-to-the-cdc-whistleblower) There is a disturbance in the antivaccine Force. I can sense it. Actually, it doesn't take any special talent to detect this. You don't have to be some sort of pro-science Jedi. The evidence is everywhere. The most prominent examples of posts in the antivaccine crankosphere that tipped me off are on\u2014of course!\u2014the antivaccine propaganda blog Age of Autism, which references another blog's post with blaring capitalized headlines, BREAKING: CDC WHISTLEBLOWER \"DR. THOMPSON HAS BEEN HANDLED\" SAYS DR. HOOKER AT MANHATTAN VAXXED Q&A. Elsewhere, He Who Shall Not Be Named (and to whom I shall no... I heard the news yesterday morning. I was in clinic seeing patients. It was a bit of a slow morning; there was time between patients. So I spent it, as is my wont when clinic is a bit slow, signing charts (OK, signing off on charts in the electronic medical record; I haven't actually physically signed a chart in a while) and idly checking Facebook and Twitter when finished with that. Then I saw it: Authorities Respond to a Medical Call at Paisley Park, with a comment that Prince was dead. I read the article; it said that someone had been found dead at Prince's estate in Minneapolis and that... Now that I've dispensed with Mike Adams' attacks (for now), It's time to get back to business as usual. No way am I going to let Adams interfere with the business of this blog for more than one day to take note of it, even though he's now gone basically batshit crazy. Unfortunately, no sooner has Andrew Wakefield's quackfest of a propaganda \"documentary\" (VAXXED: From Cover-up to Catastrophe) been dealt with than another antivaccine propaganda film rears its ugly head. Readers have made me aware of a new Facebook page, website, Twitter feed, Instagram page, and YouTube channel for a movie... Several of you have noticed that a certain friend of the blog has been under attack from one of the quackiest of Internet quacks out there. Here is his response. The paranoia and stupidity are black hole level density. (Yes, instead of posting the whole thing, I've simply posted a link to our friend's discussion and rebuttal of Adams' charges.) One of the most pernicious lies promoted by the antivaccine movement is a trope that I've labeled the \"toxins gambit.\" Basically, it's the lie, oft repeated in hysterical terms, that there are all sorts of horrible toxic chemicals in vaccines, and it is those toxic substances that are responsible for the claimed adverse effects of vaccines. Now, it is true that there are substances in vaccines that can be toxic, but the toxins gambit completely ignores a little thing known as the dose-response curve or, if you want to go hundreds of years back in time, the admonition attributed to Paracelsus... My state is screwed up, and the epicenter of the fallout from the dysfunctional mess that is the Michigan state government is the city of Flint. As you probably recall, around the holidays a story that had previously been mainly a Michigan story broke nationally in a big way. It is the story of how a combination of the imposition of an emergency manager on the city, epic incompetence at the level of the state and local government, and outright denial of a problem for several months by the veyr state agency (the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality) charged with making sure that things... It's an oft-stated cliche that our children our our future. That's the reason stories involving dire threats to children are considered so terrifying. It's why, for instance, Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End resonated so creepily. After all, as part of the end of civilization, a frightening change came over the children, who became far superior in abilities and mental power to their parents. Another example includes Greg Bear's Darwin's Radio, whose plot involves the human race being plagued by a new disease called \"Herod's Flu,\" which causes pregnant women to spontaneously abort their... I know I really shouldn't peruse NaturalNews.com too often. It's bad for my blood pressure, and, like many old farts on the wrong side of 50, I do have a touch of the ol' hypertension. Reading Mike Adams' blather risks raising that blood pressure either through causing me to laugh uproariously at the sheer idiocy of what he writes or by making me angry at just how despicable he can be at times. Still, I looked, and I saw something I almost wish I hadn't seen. However, that something that I saw illustrates a point about the dark side of open access journals; so I thought it was worth... "}
