Each season has a specific focus on the organ systems in the body. The goal of the Inner Weave Cleanse is to alkalize the body to support health and detoxification. Alkalizing builds a strong foundation in your body with good digestion and elimination, healthy red blood cells and active white blood cells. Cleansing balances our blood sugar and blood pressure, and strengthens our immune system. Reaching your health and wellness goals requires motivation and support. Choose 10, 14, or 21 Day Cleanse. Cleanse & Detox Course meets For 3 Sessions on Zoom. Spring Cleanse Course March 15, 22 and 29. 5:30 pm MT. or 7:30 ET. Awaken from winter into spring, a perfect time for detoxifying the liver and gallbladder. The Wood Element is the upward energy of spring, bursting with life force from the earth. Spring is the most popular season for cleansing the body after a long stagnant winter. April Spring Cleanse & Detox Course on ZOOM April 11, 18, 25. Summer Cleanse Course ZOOM: June 13, 20, 27. 5:30 pm MT / 7:30 ET. Energize The Fire Element and get the blood circulating. Cleanse the intestinal system and purify the blood. Summer cleansing is fun and easy when we have access to an abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables to cleanse and cool down the fire of summer. Harvest Cleanse Late summer and early fall is The Earth Element. Time for the harvest that nourishes us. The Earth element rules the digestive system that needs live enzymes from fresh raw fruits and vegetables to support digestion and absorption of nutrients and minerals to build strong blood. Fall Cleanse The Metal Element rules the lungs and the colon. Cleansing at this time of year 'cleans out the pipes' from breathing into the lungs and storing toxins all the way down into the gut. Relives allergy symptoms and nourishes our gut health back into balance. Fall is your window of time to build immunity to prepare for the winter when we are more susceptible to viruses, colds & flus. Winter Cleanse Jan. 4, 5:30 MT. or 7:30 ET. Class 2, Jan. 10. Closure class is Jan. 17. The winter is The Element of Water and getting it moving is essential for health and vitality. The water element rules the kidneys. People who tend to get sick in the winter often have exhausted adrenals causing Qi/Chi stagnation and a weakened immunity. By cleansing our internal waters we energize the body and clarify the mind. \"I completed my first 10-day winter cleanse with Lenore and I was grateful to have her support and the support of my group to move through the phases of cleansing. Lenore's knowledge of safe methods for using herbs and her amazing recipes for soups and smoothies got me through. I recommended her course to my friends and we are going to create a group class with Lenore this spring.\" - Susan H. Teacher. \"My past experience doing a detox was The Master Cleanse, about a year ago. I felt some highs and lows during that detox but never got to feel stronger or in better health. Lenore pointed out that you can't build health on a cleanse of lemons and maple syrup. She coached me through how to do a nourishing detox that cleanses the body, heals the liver, and builds red blood cells. I now feel like I have the knowledge and skills I need to maintain my optimal health thanks to her instruction.\" -David S. Tech. Support Release the patterns in the body that generate tension, pain and stagnation. Activating Acupressure points along the meridians and conscious breathing moves your energy flow, (Qi/Chi) and supports the release of emotional and physical restrictions and pain. Each session opens up the meridians to generate flow and transform stuck patterns in the body. Long held patterns of holding and protecting your body have been established through your emotions, trauma, injuries, thoughts, work habits, and how you move or don't move your body. Fear and pain cause the body to contract and hold tension, creating blocks in the flow of Qi/Chi and a build up of lactic acid and toxins. Acupressure and deep tissue massage therapy can open these blocks and release pain, bringing the body and mind back into balance. Acupressure bodywork sessions use the same Chinese Medicine system as acupuncture, but without needles. I hold acupressure points along the specific meridians (pathways) using my hands and fingers. When needed, I include Cupping therapy, moxabustion and Gua Sha techniques. \"I have benefited greatly from Lenore's healing hands! I have never had a more on target massage before seeing Lenore. Her integration of massage and acupressure point holding released my chronic neck and shoulder pain. She knew exactly where to go to create the release of pain and stiffness. I continue to see her for bodywork and I highly recommend her to my associates.\" -Laura G. Accountant. "}
