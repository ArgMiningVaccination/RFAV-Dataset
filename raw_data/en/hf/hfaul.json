Restore plc ( [LON:RST](https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/commercial-services/aim-rst/restore-shares?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_source=yahoo&utm_campaign=Intro_ticker&blueprint=93252)) is a small-cap stock with a market capitalization of UK\u00a3636.9m. While investors primarily focus on the growth potential and competitive landscape of the small-cap companies, they end up ignoring a key aspect, which could be the biggest threat to its existence: its financial health. Why is it important? So, understanding the company's financial health becomes crucial, as mismanagement of capital can lead to bankruptcies, which occur at a higher rate for small-caps. Here are a few basic checks that are good enough to have a broad overview of the company's financial strength. Nevertheless, I know these factors are very high-level, so I'd encourage you to [dig deeper yourself into RST here](https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/commercial-services/aim-rst/restore-shares?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_source=yahoo&utm_campaign=Conc_ticker&blueprint=93252). How does RST's operating cash flow stack up against its debt? Over the past year, RST has maintained its debt levels at around UK\u00a389.2m - this includes both the current and long-term debt. At this stable level of debt, the current cash and short-term investment levels stands at UK\u00a310.7m , ready to deploy into the business. Moreover, RST has generated cash from operations of UK\u00a311.0m during the same period of time, resulting in an operating cash to total debt ratio of 12.3%, signalling that RST's current level of operating cash is not high enough to cover debt. This ratio can also be a sign of operational efficiency as an alternative to return on assets. In RST's case, it is able to generate 0.12x cash from its debt capital. Can RST meet its short-term obligations with the cash in hand? At the current liabilities level of UK\u00a345.4m liabilities, the company has been able to meet these obligations given the level of current assets of UK\u00a356.1m, with a current ratio of 1.24x. Generally, for Commercial Services companies, this is a reasonable ratio as there's enough of a cash buffer without holding too capital in low return investments. Does RST face the risk of succumbing to its debt-load? RST is a relatively highly levered company with a debt-to-equity of 57.2%. This is not uncommon for a small-cap company given that debt tends to be lower-cost and at times, more accessible. We can check to see whether RST is able to meet its debt obligations by looking at the net interest coverage ratio. A company generating earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) at least three times its net interest payments is considered financially sound. In RST's, case, the ratio of 11.08x suggests that interest is comfortably covered, which means that debtors may be willing to loan the company more money, giving RST ample headroom to grow its debt facilities. Next Steps: RST's cash flow coverage indicates it could improve its operating efficiency in order to meet demand for debt repayments should unforeseen events arise. However, the company will be able to pay all of its upcoming liabilities from its current short-term assets. This is only a rough assessment of financial health, and I'm sure RST has company-specific issues impacting its capital structure decisions.
