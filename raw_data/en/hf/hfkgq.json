They're the most common, everyday health complaints, and while you may not be able to prevent them with a little at-home preparation, you can knock each of them out for the count and just maybe avoid a visit to your doctor. The secret? A well-stocked medicine chest. First things first: You've got to take stock of what's in there already -- and then clean and restock it annually.

This is also the time to get your prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines out of there, and not just because your guests might snoop.
