A low CD4 count , which occurs in HIV infection, indicates that the patient is at risk of opport unistic infections and illness. DOT - directly observed therapy - a treatment method in which patients are under direct observation when they take their medication FTC - Emtricitabine - a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor antiretroviral IDU - injecting drug users, a term now largely replaced by people who inject drugs MSM (men who have sex with men ) - refers to all men , including bisexual men, who engage in sexual and/or romantic relations with other men. PEP Post-exposure prophylaxis: ART given to someone who has been exposed to HIV, to prevent them from becoming infected. PrEP Pre-exposure prophylaxis: ART given to someone who is at risk of exposure to HIV, prior to the exposure, to prevent them from becoming infected. PWID - people who inject drugs Serodiscordant / serodifferent Used to describe sexual partne rs with different H IV status. STI - sexually transmitted infection TDF - tenofovir disoproxil fumarate - a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor antiretroviral Transgender : Refers to people who have a different sex, gender identity, and/or gender expression than the one assigned to them at birth. Trans woman - a person who is born as a male but identifies themselves as a woman. Trans man - a person who is born as a woman but identifies themselves as a man. Treatment as prevention (Tas P) describes the use of ART , in HIV positive individuals, with the aim of preventing HIV transmission to others rather than primarily for their own clinical benefit. Viral load - refers to t he activity of HIV in a bo dily fluid (e.g. blood, semen). 6 2 Introduction 2.1 HIV epidemiology HIV is a disease of major importance in the UK. The life expectancy for those who are diagnosed in time and who have access to high quality care is equivalent to that of people who are HIV free. However, treatment is life long and the quality of life for people with HIV is frequently compromised making it a difficult and complex condition to live with. The average cost of one person treated over their lifetime, in the UK, has been estimated at around \u00a3360,000 (based on median life expectancy of 71.5 years), which is largely down to the cost of antiretrovirals. (Nakagawa et al., 2015) . Gay, bisexual, transgender women (transwomen) and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are at the highest risk of acquiring HIV in the UK (Public Health England, 2014) . Among MSM , annual numbers of new diagnoses reported for the past decade have not declined , and modelling estimates suggest that HIV incidence has actually increased (Phillips et al., 2013) . These trends have occurred despite increased HIV testing (Public Health England, 2014, Sonnenberg et al., 2013) , and a move towards earlier i nitiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) , which renders most patients non -infectious within six months (Brown et al., 2014, Wilson, 2012) Increasing evidence shows th e positive impact of ART used by people living with HIV, in terms of prevention of onward transmission, to both the individual and to the wider population. Effective therapy lowers the amount and activity of the virus, making the person with HIV less infe ctious. Data from the START (strategic timing of antiretroviral treatment) (Insight Start Study Group et al., 2015) and TEMPRANO (Temprano ANRS Study Group et al., 2015) studies have confirm ed the wider health benefits of early ART for reducing the risk of serious illnesses and other infections in people with HIV. Although HIV testing and pro motion of condoms are core strategies for reducing risk , additional approaches have been proposed for HIV negative people at high risk of infection . Treatment as prevention (Tas P), to prevent transmission to HIV negative partners as well as to treat HIV infection, has recently been approved i n a separate clinical commissioning policy by NHS England (NHS England, 2015) . An innovative and effective approach is the use of antiretroviral dr ugs before exposure, given to people who do not have HIV to prevent an established infection , referred to as pre - 7 exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) . This review examines the available evidence for the clinical efficacy, clinical effectiveness, clinical safety and cost-effectiveness for th e use of PrEP in HIV negative individuals. In the UK, 107,000 (95% credible interval 101,600 - 115,800) people were estimated to be living with HIV in 2013 (PHE annual report 2014), giving an overall prevalence of 2.8 per 1,000 population aged 15 - 59 years old (1.9 per 1000 women; 3.7 per 1000 men ) (Public Health England, 2014) . It is estimated that a round one quarter of people with HIV were unaware of their infecti on (26,100 individuals) (Public Health England, 2014) . This presents a major public health challenge since undiagnosed individuals, who may have condomless sex without appreciating the risk posed to partners, contribute disproportionately to ongoing transmission in the population. Retention in care once diagnosed is high in the UK, such that 68% (72,800/107,000) of all patie nts with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy in 2013, and 64% (68,7000/107,000) of people living with HIV were virally suppressed, with little risk of onward transmission (Public Health England, 2014) . MSM remain the group most at risk of acquiring HIV in the UK, with an estimated 43,500 (95% credible inte rval 40,200 - 48,200) men infected (Figure 1), gi ving an overall prevalence of 59 per 1,000 MSM aged 15 to 59 years old (Public Health England, 2014) . HIV also disproportionately affects people of black -African ethnicity (Figure 1) although , like other groups at risk, most do not have HIV. Around two - thirds (38,700/59,500) of heterosexual people living with HIV in England in 2013 were of black -African ethnicity, and the prevalence of HIV in this group was 56 per 1,000 population aged 15 -59 years old (Public Health England, 2014) . While prevalence in MSM is similar to that in people of black -African ethnicity in the UK, the incidence of new infections is different: 76% (2,470) of reported infections in MSM were probably acquired in the UK in 2013, compared to 57% (1,500) of infections in heterosexual m en and women (Public Health England, 2014) . The proportion of new diagnoses that were recent wa s also higher among MSM th an heterosexual men and women (30% versus 13%). 8 Figure 1. Estimated number of people living with HIV (both diagn osed and undiagnosed): UK, 2012 * Source: PHE *2012 figures used as these are relevant to the latest available from GUMCAD (see Tables 2 & 3). There are more recent (2013) figures avail able for numbers estimated to be living w ith HIV in the UK (Public Health England, 2014) . Among attendees at specialist sexual health clinics, which is likely to be the primary clinical service providing PrEP in any proposed national PrEP programme, the incidence of HIV among all MSM is nearly eight fold higher than the incidence in Black African heterosexuals (Table 1) . This has significant implications for the likely cost-effectiveness of any programme (see below). Analyses of national surveillance data suggest that it is possible to identify sub -populations of MSM attending sex ual health clinics with particularly high incidence, for exa mple those who attended two or more times in the previous year, and those presenting for post -exposure HIV prophylaxis (Table 2). An important group of heterosexual individuals, who are likely to be in contact with sexual health services and in whom HIV incidence might be high, are the regular partners of people with newly diagnosed HIV . 9 Table 1. Estimated HIV incidence among sexual health clinic attendees in 2012 Group of attendees (N=3930) Estimated incidence clinics submitted specimens for recent infection testing; 50% of w hich related to MSM. Available at: http://sti.bmj.com/content/91/Suppl_1/A2.1.abstract Table 2. HIV incidence in HIV negative MSM who re -attended at STI clinics in 2012 Category HIV incidence (per 100 py) 95% CI HIV test 42 -365 days prior to current attendance 2.4 2.0-2.8 Diagnosed with bacterial STI in previous year and/or at current attendance 3.3 2.8-4.0 Diagnosed with rectal bacterial STI in previous year and/or at current attendance 5.2 3.7-6.7 Received post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in previous year 3.3 1.7-6.3 Source: GUMCAD, HIV& STI Department, Health Protection, PHE, HIV incidence analyses:2012 Compared to many countries, the prevalence of HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID) is low in the UK, largely due to highly successful needle exchange programmes (Public Health England et al., 2014, Public Health England and National Infection Service, 2015) . In 2013, there w ere just 130 new HIV diagnoses thought to have been acquired through injecting drug use, and the number of diagnoses in this group has fallen or remained stable over the past eight years. 10 2.2 Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) In the UK, Truvada tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC)) has been licensed for the treatment of HIV -1 infection in adults (18 years and above) for more than a decade. It is not currently licensed for PrEP in the UK, although Gilead is planning to submit to the European Medicines Agency for a license for this indication. The components of Truvada are licensed for single agent use i.e. tenofovir and/or emtricitabine in children (less than 18 years of age) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Data, from a moderate number of pregnant women , have not indicated any malformations or foetal / neonatal toxicity associated with either tenofovir or emtricitabine. The UK summary of product characteristics supports the use of Truvada as an option to treat HIV -1 infecti on in pregnant women. The patent for Truvada expires in 2018 in the UK. The patent for emtricitabine (single agent) is set to expire in 2016 followed by the patent for tenofovir (single agent) in 2017. There is no guarant ee that there will be generic versions of either of these drugs available on the UK market. It is highly likely, however, that there will be multiple generic suppliers for tenofovir and probably also for emtricitabine if there is sufficient demand. Daily oral tenofovir or Truvada are used extensively in the UK as part of triple thera py in HIV infected populations and are generally very well tolerated although nausea, gastro -intestinal symptoms and headache are common in the first few weeks. Deterioration i n renal function is a more serious, but rare, side effect of tenofovir seen in HIV positive populations. Although there is measurable loss of bone mineral density, it is not clear if this will be clinically relevant in the long -term. The US Food and Drug Administration licensed Truvada for use as PrEP in July 2012 for individuals at risk of acquiring HIV through sexual exposure. The European Medicines Agency and the European Centre for Disease Contro l and Prevention issued statements in 2012, as did the B ritish Association for Sexual Health and the British HIV Association, calling for more research to address several areas of concern. These included: whether PrEP would lead to a reduction in the use of condoms and a subsequent increase in other sexually tr ansmitted infections (STIs) and how cost -effective it would be. Risk compensation and cost were noted as 11 provider concerns by the World H ealth Organisation in July 2014 when it recommended PrEP for use in MSM (World Health Organisation, 2014) : \"Among men who have sex with men, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended as an additional HIV prevention choice within a comprehensive HIV prevention package for PrEP\" Two European studies , one in England (PROUD) and one in France and Canada (IPERGAY ), were started in 2012 and reported in 2015. The studies recruited MSM and in both studies the comparator arm , without PrEP , had a much higher rate of HIV infection than expected (McCormack et al., 2015, Fonsart et al., 2014, Molina and et al, 2015) . PROUD set out to assess the net benefit of efficacy and risk compensation in an open -label design in which MSM who knew they were taking PrEP were compared to MSM who did not have access to PrEP (McCormack et al., 2015) . IPERGAY set out to assess an \"on-demand \" regimen that MSM took before and after s ex, based on the rationale that lower drug exposure would have the advantage of less risk of toxicity as well as reduced cost. This was compared to placebo as there was uncertainty about the biological efficacy of an \"on-demand \" regimen (Fonsart et al., 2014) . Following on from reports of these two trials, the ECDC update d their statement in April 2015 as follows (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2015) : \"on the basis of the new evidence, EU Member States should give consideration to integrating PrEP into their existing HIV prevention package for those most at -risk of HIV infection, starting with MSM. Issues related to larger -scale PrEP implementation, such as cost -effectiveness, appropriate models of care and access points, provider training, routine monitoring of patients, including adherence to treatment and regular testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, will need to be assessed and carefully addressed in the context of each Member State's health system.\" 12 2.3 Cost -effectiveness Cost-effectiveness evaluations, mainly based on data from the USA, suggest t hat the use of PrEP among high -risk MSM can be cost -effective with significant budgetary impac t. In the English setting, cost -effectiveness will need to consider local factors such as HIV incidence in the target group offered PrEP, patient adherence to tak ing PrEP, levels of condomless sex and numbers of sexual partners. In addition, considerations in published economic evaluations, such as the perspective taken (e.g. provider) and level of discount rates may differ from those used in England and will affec t whether the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PrEP falls within a defined threshold. 3 Research Questions This systematic literature review has been undertaken to inform NHS England decision -making about integrating PrEP into the existing HI V preve ntion package for those most at risk of HIV infection in England. The research question was: is oral PrEP clinically efficacious, clinically effective and what factors affect cost-effectiveness ? The populations considered were: o men who have sex with men o transgender women / trans women o heterosexual men and women o serodiscordant / serodifferent couples (couples with different HIV status) o people who inject drugs / injecting drug users 13 4 Methodology 4.1 Clinical efficacy , effectiveness and safety for each risk population A literature search was conducted using broad terms in order to capture as many papers as possible relating to clinical efficacy , effectiveness and safety . Those selected were then divided by risk group. The cost-effectiveness search was done separately and is also reported here. Papers reporting intent -to treat analyses that were modified by exclusion of individuals who were found to be HIV positive at enrolment were included . This was not considered to have introduced bias, as th is is standard practice in HIV prevention RCTs Studies that changed following an interim analysis were considered to have some degree of bias, as were efficacy studies in which the majority of participants did not take the study drug. 4.2 Search strategy Two electronic databases: PubMed and Embase were searched limiting the search to a ten year period from 15th October 2004 to 15th October 2014. References of all studies included in the review were searched for further relevant studies. The intervention (I), comparator (C) and outcome (O) questions were the same for each population i.e. for each population of MSM/trans women, heterosexual men and women, serodiscordant or O: HIV infecti on, adverse event, risk behaviours or risk compensation ( condom use, number of sexual partners, STIs), adherence The broad search terms used were: 14 HIV AND (pre -exposure prophylaxis OR preexposure prophylaxis OR PREP) Full title screen was performed to rem ove obviously irrelevant articles. Shortlisted titles underwent full abstract review. Abstracts were grouped into population and subject groups: MSM, PWID , heterosexual, m odelling. Transgender women were considered within the MSM population as they were eligible to take part in the same trials. Full papers were shortlisted using the eligibility criteria above. 4.3 Inclusion & exclusion criteria To be included in the review, articles had to meet the following criteria: 1. Randomised control trial, non -randomi sed control trial, cohort study evaluating the use of oral PrEP to prevent HIV infection . 2. Measured one of the key outcomes: HIV infection, any adverse event, any stage 3 or 4 adverse event, condom use, number of sexual partners, STIs and adherence 3. Published in a peer -reviewed journal or presented as an abstract at a scientific conference betwee n 15th October 2004 and 15th October 2014. Only human and English language studies were included in the review. Studies among people who \"use\" rather than \"inject\" drugs were not included as HIV risk and transmission differ in th ese groups . 4.4 Data extra ction and management Data w ere extracted using a standardized extraction form . The following information was gathered from each included study: 1. Study design and intervention details: design, summary of patient pathway, number of patients, inclusion/exclus ion criteria, patient characteristics, intervention, comparator 2. Outcomes measures 15 3. Results: HIV incidence, adherence, factors associated with benefit, STI rate, reported risk behaviour A separate extraction table was generated for clinical safety , which included details of grade 3 and 4 adverse events, resistance mutations, renal function, bone safety and any other safety events of note. The literature search was updated for all risk populations as follows: MSM/trans women - the literature search was re -run from 1 January 2014 to 28 August 2015 using the search terms: HIV AND (pre -exposure prophylaxis OR preexposure prophylaxis OR PREP) and (men who have sex with men OR MSM OR transgender women OR trans women) Heterose xual & serodiscordant /serodifferent couples - The search was re -run using the same search strategy to inc lude all papers up to 31 July 2015; PWID - the search was re -run using the same search strategy up to 31 July 2015. Data presented at conferences (abst racts published) where these have not, at the time of this review, been published in the peer reviewed literature and where they provide useful information have been included. The main evidence is tabulated in the Results section below and scored and graded using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN ) levels and grades of evidence (Tables A & B). 4.5 Cost -effectiveness 4.5.1 PrEP modelling and cost -effectiveness evidence review (updated July 2015) A literature review of the evidence on cost -effectiveness of PrEP in high income countries with concentrated HIV epidemic was conducted . We attempt to answer the following questions: 1. Is PrEP cost -effective? 2. In what setting? 16 3. Under what assumptions? 4.5.2 Search strategy PubM ed, Embase , Ovid, Web Derwent Innovations IndexSM, MEDLINE\u00ae, BIOSIS Citation IndexSM were searched limiting the search to between 15th October 2004 and 10th July 2015 . We added a presentation made by Cambiano et al. at the BASHH conference in June 2015, and an abstract reporting the Public Health England cost -effectiveness model presented at Public Health England Annual Conference (September 2015) as the abstract s were not picked up by the searches. The PICO questions were modified, where necessary, to be specific to cost - effectiveness considerations and are given below: P: All HIV negative populations , regardless of risk group, living in a high income country with concentrated HIV epidemic I: Oral PrEP C: Placebo, no behavioural interventions O: time, total and incremental costs, quality -adjusted -life-years (QALYs) gained or disability -adjusted life - years (DALYs) averted, incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER) The search terms used were: HIV AND (pre -exposure prophylaxis OR p reexposure prophylaxis OR PREP) AND (cost or cost -effectiveness or economi c or economics or economic evaluations). Full title s were screen ed to eliminate clearly irrelevant articles. Full abstract review was performed on s hortlisted titles. Full -text papers were shortlisted using the eligibility criteria above. Data presented a t conferences (abstracts available, but not published in peer reviewed journals at the time of this review) have been included. 17 4.5.3 Inclusion & exclusion criteria To be included in the review, articles ha d to meet the following criteria: 1.

The numbers of papers identifi ed are given below , by risk group, and include those found in the updated literature searches. 5.1 MSM / trans women The literature search was updated on 28 August 2015 and two conference abstracts reporting efficacy/effectiveness were identified one of which has subsequently been published online on 09 September 2015 (McCormack et al., 2015) . Across both searc hes, 9 full papers were reviewed for clinical efficacy, clinical effectiveness and safety of PrEP for MSM of which 6 were RCT, 5 with placebo - control, and 2 with no -PrEP controls. Of these, the following are included in this review: one Phase 3, and two Ph ase 3 that reported in the pilot phase report efficacy and/or effectiveness (Grant et al., 2010, McCormack et al., 2015, Molina and et al, 2015) and two Phase 2 that reported safety (Grohskopf et al., 2013, Mutua et al., 2012) . Three further papers related to the Phase 3 iPrEX study provided further details on adherence, risk behaviours, and association with drug levels and HSV acquisition (Liu et al., 2014, Marcus et al., 2013, Marcus et al., 2014) ; two further papers related to the US Safety trial cohort (Grohskopf et al., 2013) were included in the safety tables (Liu et al., 2011, Liu et al., 2013) . One cohort study, which was an open label extension of the Phase 3 RCT that reported efficacy was also included in the review (Grant et al., 2014) . 5.2 Heterosexua l / serodi scordant / serodifferent Four full papers were reviewed for clinical efficacy and safety of PrEP for heterosexuals. Of these, two RCTs were included in the final review (Thigpen et al., 21 2012, Van Damme et al., 2012) ; and two papers related to this trial providing further details on baseline characteristics, risk behaviours and adverse events (Headley et al., 2014, Kasonde et al., 2014a) . Of 339 abstracts reviewed, 10 full papers were reviewed for clinical efficacy , effectiveness and safety of Pr EP for serodiscordant couples. Of these, there was one Phase 3 randomized control trial (Baeten et al., 2012) . All other publications were subset - or pilot analyses of the same study (Celum et al., 2013, Celum et al., 2014, Curran et al., 2012, Curran et al., 2013, Kahle et al., 2012, Mugwanya et al., 2013, Mujugira et al., 2011, Murnane et al., 2013, Baet en et al., 2014a) . The search was re -run using the same search strategy to include all papers up to 3 1 July 2015. It identified 572 papers published since 15 October 2014, which after de - duplication and hand searching through titles was reduced to 56 unique and relevant papers. 12 papers and one conference abstract were added to the evidence review. One paper was a Phase 3 RCT previously reported as a conference abstract (Marrazzo et al., 2015) , and all other publications were sub -analyses of studies already included (Baeten et al., 2014b, Baeten et al., 2014c, Chirwa et al., 2014, Grant et al., 2015, Kasonde et al., 2014a, Lehman et al., 2015 , Mandala et al., 2014, Mugo et al., 2014a, Mugo et al., 2014b, Mugwanya et al., 2015, Murnane et al., 2014, Ndase et al., 2015) . 5.3 PWID Nine full papers were reviewed for clinical efficacy and safety of PrEP for PWID . Of these, one randomized placebo -control led trial was included in final review (Choopanya et al., 2013) ; and four papers related to this trial prov iding further details on baseline characteristics, risk behaviours and adverse events (Choopanya et al., 2013, Martin et al., 2011, Martin et al., 2014a, Martin et al., 2014b) . The literature search was re -run using the same criteria on 30 July 2015 and identified two additional papers both of which related to the initial Choopanya et al RCT (Vanichseni et al., 2015, Martin et al., 2015) . 22 5.4 Cost -effectiveness Of the 1,402 titles reviewed, seven full-text papers (Chen and Dowdy, 2014, Desai et al., 2008, Juusola et al., 2012, Ouellet et al., 2015, Paltiel et al., 2009, Schneider et al., 2014, K essler et al., 2014) , five conference abstracts (Anderson and Cooper, 2009, Vaidya and Campbell, 2015, Drabo et al., 2015, Cambiano et al., 2015, Ong et al., 2015) and one correspondence (Koppenhaver et al., 201 1) were included in the final review of cost -effectiveness and modelling of PrEP. 23 5.5 Tables summaris ing studies identified 5.5.1 Table 3: Clinical efficacy / effectiveness by risk group Drugs have been reported using alternative names (brand or generic) in different papers.

There was ev idence of risk compensation in that a larger proportion of participants on PrEP than those not on PrEP reported 10 or more condomless anal sex partners at month 12 (21% compared to 12%; p=0.03 test f or trend). 57% immediate and 50% def er red had a bacterial STI during f ollow -up, most commonly gonorrhoea and chlamy dia; 36% rectal gonorrhoea or chlamy dia.

Participants screened, and seen at months 0, 1, 2 then 2 monthly withHIV testing every visit, STI testing every 6 months or when indicated. Design changed on 23 October 2014 following recommendation of Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommendation Number of patient s and their characteristics 414 HIV negative adult MSM and transgender women reporting condomless anal intercourse with 2 or more partners in past 6 months. Exclude if Truvada contra -indicated. Countries: France; median age 35, white Baseli ne: bacterial STI 25%; PEP use 31%; median sex acts previous 4 weeks 10; median partners 2 months 8 Intervention Truvada On demand according to anticipated risk (2 pills 2 -24 hours before sex, 1 pill 24 hours after the first dose and a second pill 48 hou rs after the first dose ) Comparator Placebo HIV incidence Adherence Safety Risk behaviours HIV incidence in the placebo group was 6.6/100pyrs and in immediate group 0.94/100pyrs, which is an 86% reduction (95%CI 40-99; p=0.002). The rate difference was 5.66 suggesting18 individuals from a similar population would need to be treated to avert one infection. The number of participants who acquired HIV while in the study was: 14 in the placebo group and two in the immediate group. Both of those in the immediate group were deemed to be a result of non -adherence to PrEP. Adherence : 14 (7%) had no further prescr iptions after the enrolment visit. Median pills per month was 16 (IQR 10 -23). Adherence in terms of correct use of PrEP per sex act was modest with only 43% of reported sex acts covered by a dose of Truvada before and after sex based on data collected in 3 19 participants on 1212 sex acts. No PrEP was used in 28% of sex acts In an earlier report (Fonsart 2014) based on 113 participants in whom: plasma samples were collected: TFV and FTC were detected in 86% (82 -100% according to study visits) and 82% (75 - 100%) of pts in the TDF/FTC arm, and 4% (0 -6%) and 3% (0 -6%) in the placebo arm respectively. Safety: gastro -intestinal adverse events more common in Truvada group (13% vs 6%; p=0.013), as 7%; p=0.042) Risk: the number of partners, frequency of sex and condom use remained similar throughout follow -up in both groups. 276 STIs diagnosed in 141 (34%) participants during follow -up, most commonly gonorrhoea and chlamydia; there were no differences between the groups. T here were 6 incidence hepatitis C infections (3 Truvada, 3 placebo) Molina , CROI 2015 (Molin a and et al) Fonsar t IAS 2014 Placebo control needed in this randomised design as clinical pharmacologists not confident that the on-demand regimen would have biological efficacy, therefore risk behavior had to be the same in both groups (achieved by participants not knowing whether or not they are on active drug). Design changed after interim analysis because of the high rate of HIV in the placebo group, and the high level of effectiveness in the Truvada group. HIV incidence more than twice what the research team expected in the placebo group. Higher protection than reported in previou s placebo -controlled trials, and this was in spite of modest adherence per sex act, suggesting that MSM tailored the on -demand regimen to periods of risk extremely well. Overall, drug used approximated to half that required to support a daily regimen. 26 1++ iPrEx Study design Phase 3 RCT HIV negative MSM or transgender women randomised to Truvada or placebo.

Of note, there was a relatively high loss to follow up (15%) and although triangulation of adherence measures included self -report, pill count and drug levels, MEMS cap monitorin g could have been used. However, this was overall a high quality study conducted in a multi -centre multi -country setting with findings that are likely to be generalizable to an English population. 27 2+ iPReX OLE (Open Label Extension) Study design and pathways Cohort formed by offering PrEP to participants in iPrEX, US PrEP safety study and Project PrEPare. Drug levels were measured in quarterly samples collected from seroconvertors and a random selection of seronegative controls to estimate relati ve efficacy. Participants were screened then seen at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 and every 12 weeks until week 72, tested for HIV at every visit when samples for drug detection were also collected; STIs were checked every 24 weeks or at interim visits if symptomatic .

Drug levels measured every quarter and used the results in a case -control analysis of seroconvertors compared to seronegative controls by dividing follow -up time into estimated number of pills taken each week. No t randomized control so it is possible that those who we re good at taking their pills were also at lower risk. However, there were no seroconversions seen when drug level was compatible with 4 or more pills a week. Uptake of PrEP was high including in those who were more often engaged in high risk sexual pract ices, who also had good adherence Very low proportion interrupted due to side-effects. Overall, retention was lower in younger men. Reported risk went down with time among PrEP and no -PrEP recipients.

Thigp en NEJM 2012 Kason de PLoS One 2014 (Bone) Summary: Primary limitation was that a high proportion of par ticipants did not complete the study per protocol, introducing an acceptable risk of bias. The study provides good evidence for the efficacy (62.2%) and safety of daily Truvada in heterosexuals. 8-10% loss to FU Study judged to have relatively high internal validity. Randomisation was well conducted, adequate concealment was used, subjects and investigators were blinded, relevant outcomes were measured and an intention to treat analysis was performed. However, study was concluded early because 33% d id not complete the study per protocol and nearly 10% were permanently lost to follow up. For this reason, the study was downgraded to having an acceptable risk of bias. The study was underpowered to detect efficacy by gender subsets. 29 There was no difference in grade 3 or 4 events between the 2 arms of the study (3.1% Truvada arm vs 4.8% placebo arm) 2 participants developed resistance (1 placebo and 1 Truvada arm).

Randomisation was well conducted, with adeq uate concealment and blinding. Study was very large, and retention was 91%. Analysis was a modified intention to treat analysis. The study was graded as having an acceptable risk of bias. The major problem with the study was in adherence (albeit that the participants self -reported high adherence). There were significant differences found between those using and not using the products (measured by serum drug level), and the likelihood of HIV exposure may also have differed.

Overall, a small nonprogressive change was seen in eGFR, which was not accompanied by increase in clinica lly relevant changes. 36 PWID / INJECTING DRUG USERS 1+ The Bangkok Tenofovir Study Study design and pathway Double blind placebo controlled RCT 1:1 randomisation of PWID to tenofovir or placebo.

DOT on 86.9% of days (SD 24.7) and adherence on DOT was (IQR 80.3 -98.8) and non in older age (>40 years), women. Safety: nausea and vomiting more common in the tenofovir grouo (8% vs 5%) but this resolved by the second month of follow -up. Mild to moderate elevations in liver transaminases also more common in the tenofovir group (53% vs 49%). No tenofovir associated mutations observed. Risk Compensation: no differences between the groups, but a large reduction by 12 months follow -up in injecting drug use (63% to 23%) and sharing needles (18% to 2%); sex >1 partner (22% enrollment to 6% month 72; 4.8% men reported sex with male partner in past 3 months at basel ine, declined to 1% at month 7 2. Choopanya Lancet 2013 Martin PLoS One 2011 Martin PLoS One 2014 First and only placebo controlled trial in PWID, using single agent tenofovir. Randomisation was well conducted, adequate concealment was used, subjects and investigators were blinded, relevant outcomes were measured and an intention to treat analysis was performed. However there was a relatively large loss to FU in both groups, introducing some bias. No difference between the groups for the first 3 years of follow -up. One possible exp lanation is that tenofovir had little impact on risk from injecting drug use, and the benefit from sexual risk only emerged after the injecting drug use risks had reduced considerably in the study population. Generalisability to a UK population is difficu lt as the injecting risk behaviours differ and we have needle -exchange programmes which have successfully contained the epidemic in PWID. 37 PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS contd Martin AIDS 2015: Analysis of effectiveness according to reported adherence in RCT cohort. 9665 pyrs of follow -up in 2413 individuals followed for an average of 4 yrs (maximum 6.9 yrs). 628 (26.0%) were in daily directly observed therapy follow -up throughout, 1711 (70.9%) switched between daily and monthly visits, and 74 (3.1%) were in monthly follow -up throughout. Overall, 86.9% of days were DOT with 1534 (63.9%) of participants spending 95% or more time in DOT. Participants and staff signed the study diaries which were use d to assess adherence (84.4% days in DOT and 88.9% in non -DOT). Adherence was better in older participants (p<0.001) and after controlling for age, in women (p=0.04). Factors associated with lower adherence included incarceration (p=0.02), injecting metham phetamine (p=0.04) and having a casual partner in the 3 months before enrolment (p<0.001). Effectiveness increased as adherence improved, from 48.9% overall to 83.5% reduction in HIV incidence in those with >97.5% adherence. Martin AIDS 2015 The partici pants were allowed to switch from DOT to monthly throughout, although the majority of time was spent in DOT. DOT attendance was reimbursed and this would not be the case in practice, so adherence may be overestimated. There were relatively few HIV infectio ns so confidence intervals were wide. 38 5.5.2 Table 4 : Clinical safety results by risk group Safety Level of Evidence Study design & Intervention Outcom e measur e(s) Results Reference Comments MSM / TRANS WOMEN US MSM Saf ety Trial Study design Phase 2 RCT .

Therefore unable to evaluate efficacy. Short follow up time (4 months) Difficulties with SMS responses (problems with providers, outages) led to low rates of response using this method and requirement to use timeline followback self report data. This may have led to an overestimation of pill taking and sexual activity as median percentages for both went up to 100%. High a lcohol use before sex (almost 50%), relatively high frequency of transactional sex and travel for it may have meant volunteers missed post coital doses. These factors together with the low proportion of women and African ethnicity limits its generalizabili ty to the UK population. 41 HETEROSEXUALS Use table 1 to establish level of evidence FEM -PrEP TDF-2 See results in Table 3 (Clinical Effectiveness) Thigpen NEJM 2012 Kasonde PLoS One 2014 (Bone) van Damme NEJM 2012 Headley PLoS One 2014 (baseline sexual risk) SERODISCORDANT / SERODIFFERENT COUPLES 1+ PARTNERS -PrEP Study design Double -blinded placebo controlled RCT, Phas e 3 Number of patients andtheir characteristics 4758 couples enrolled, 4747 couples followed Median age range 25-34; HIV positive partner male in 62% of couples; Median CD4 count among HIV positive 375 Heterosexual couples Ugandan or Kenyan Intervention: Oral daily tenofovir or Oral daily Truvada Comparator : Placebo Adverse events among HIV negative partner Adverse events: No difference in any grade 3 event of tenofovir vs placebo (p=0.35) or Truvada vs placebo (p=0.24) No difference in any grade 4 event of tenofovir vs placebo (p=0.64) or Truvada vs placebo (p=0.58) 8 of active arm infected with HIV at baseline; 2 developed ARV resistance: 1 in tenofovir group had K65R and 1 in Truvada group had M184V No M184V or K65R resistance among those infected after randomisation Baeten NEJM 2012 As for PARTNERS PrEP in Table 3 (clinical effectiveness) 42 Grade 2 or 3 elevated creatinine seen in <1% tenofovir group and <1% Truvada group.

INJECTING DRUG USERS / PWID 1+ (Vanichs eni Am J PH 2015) PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS contd Safety SAFETY Post-hoc analysis of CrCl showed small but significant decline in CrCl by Cockroft Gault calculation in tenofovir arm compared to placebo arm (p<0.0001), but resolved when drug stopped and remeasured median of 20 months l ater (Martin CID 2014). Analysis of causes of hospitalization and death in RCT cohort. 9786 pyrs of follow -up in 2413 individuals followed for an average of 4 yrs (maximum 6.9 yrs). All -cause mortality rate was 10.9 per 100 pyrs (95% CI 9-13.2) and standar dised mortality rate was 2.9 (2.4 -3.6), with commonest causes being drug overdose and traffic accidents. Increasing risk of death if aged 40 -59 compared to 20 -29 (HR 2.5; 95% CI 1.4, 4.3), injecting drugs (HR 2.4; 1.1, 5.4) and after controlling for inject ing those using midazolam were more likely to die than those who did not (HR 3.6; 1.8, 7.1). Participants reporting sex with a live in partner were less likely to die (HR 0.6, 0.4, 1.0). No difference between those on tenofovoir compared to placebo as prev iously reported. Martin CID 2014 (Renal function) Vanichseni et al Am J Pub Health 2015 The cohort was mainly HIV negative and untested for HCV, and a substantial morbidity and mortality comes from these two infections, so the mortality amongst PWID in Thailand is likely to be higher overall. Patterns of drug use in Bangkok and the prevalence of HIV and HCV amongst PWID differ considerably between Thailand and the UK. 43 5.5.3 Table 5: Cost -effectiveness Cost -effectiveness Level of Evidence Study design & Intervention Outcome measure(s) Results Reference Comments Conference abstract; not possible to ascertain how well the model/stud y was conducted Study population & setting: Australian MSM ; baseline HIV prevalence 9%, model allowed for changes in prevalence over time Study perspective: health sector, government as third party payer Intervention used: [1] continuous PrEP of Discount rate: 3% Currency and year: US$ (year not stated) Cost per QALY gained Costs : National PrEP program would cost $330m per year. Estimated benefits : If cont inuous PrEP was 90% effective and the program covered only HIV negative MSM having high risk sex, after 40 years prevalence of HIV would be 4.36% compared to 13.6% with no program; with intermittent PrEP, taken 50% of time, HIV prevalence would remain 9% ICER : Continuous PrEP would cost $47,745/QALY; Intermittent PrEP, taken 50% of time, would cost $6,816/QALY if 90% effective and remain cost -effective if > 46% effective sensitivity and uncertainty analysis results : Use of PrEP by MSM with low risk sexual behaviours and small increases in risk behaviour (2% per year) would render the intervention no longer cost -effective; threshold values for ICER<$50k/QALY: PrEP effectiveness >87%; baseline HIV prevalence >8%; cost of PrEP program $7536/year; cost of HIV management $13920/year; prevalence of resistance to PrEP <3%; serious adverse events <4% Anderson & Cooper (2009) Conclusion : PrEP could reduce HIV prevalence and be cost -effective in a country with a HIV epidemic in MSM, if it is more than 87% effective and coverage is targeted. Intermittent PrEP taken 50% of the time remained cost -effective as long as effectiveness was >46%. A dverse events, resistance and changes in risk behaviours would affect this finding. Budget impacts would be high and exploration of effectiveness of intermittent PrEP is warranted. Comment: Prevalence among MSM in the UK was estimated at 5.9% in 2013 and t he effectiveness within the PROUD study, conducted among MSM in the UK, was estimate to be 86%. 44 Conference abstract; not possible to ascertain how well the model/stud y was conducted Study population & setting: M SM in the UK Study perspective: health sector Intervention used: PrEP in five subgroups: [1] MSM who had had condomless anal sex in the last three months ; [1a] assuming HIV testing rates in MSM remain at the current level and no change in condom use, [1b] assuming that the increased awareness a nd interest in PrEP leads to a substantial increase in HIV testing, in order to get PrEP, and that 25% of MSM starts using PrEP instead of condom. [2] MSM who had had condomless sex with at least one casual partner in the last three months ; [3] MSM diagnosed with a bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the previous three months ; [4] MSM who had had condomless sex with at least five casual partners in any three -month period during the last year. Comparator: no PrEP Modelling and statistica l extrapolation: Willingness -to-pay threshold: k/QALY Time and year: \u00a3 (2015 ) Costs estimates: For people on PrEP: HIV testing prior to initiation and every 3 months, visit for PrEP initiation, antiretroviral drugs used for PrEP, monitoring. For all MSM: HIV testing and post -exposure prophylaxis if used For HIV positive people: use of healthcare services in HIV+, antiretrovirals, CD4, VL and resistance test Outc ome measures: cost per QALY gained (compared to a scenario of no PrEP) Cost per QALY gained (compared to a scenario of no PrEP) Costs : The cost of one year continuously on PrEP is assumed to be around \u00a35,000 and one year on ART (if CD4>200 cells/mm3) Estimated benefits : Over 80 years the introduction of PrEP would avert between 72% [option 1a] and 86% and 13% [option 1b, 2 and 3] of deaths compared to a scenario where PrEP is not introduced. ICER: as suming the cost of antiretroviral drugs [used for PrEP and ART ] do not decreases, the cost per QALY gained [compared to the scenario in which PrEP is Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis results : If the drugs cost is reduced by 50%, after patent expiry date, then PrEP would become cost -saving as well in scenarios 1a and 3 and borderline cost -effective in 1b. Cambiano et al. (2015) Conclusion : The preliminary conclusion from this study is that the use of PREP among MSM will have a dramatic impact on the HIV epidemic. It suggests it is cost - effective when targeted to men reporting five condomless partner or more in the last year [3] or presenting with a bacterial STI [4], when offered to men having condomless sex but no increase in condomless sex or HIV testing occurs [1] or when the cost of antiretrovirals is reduced by 50%. Comment: This model has been previously published and used to evaluate t he impact of increasing testing rates and expanding the treatment eligibility criteria for HIV positive patients. 45 High quality Study population & setting: HIV negative, high risk MSM Study perspective: societal perspective Intervention used: PrEP for 1 ; PrEP efficacy considered: 44% or 92% but PrEP efficacy assumed to be highly dependent on adherence, thus, authors modelled PrEP at differing levels of adherence as per iPrEx subgroup analyses Comparator: no PrEP Modelling and statistical extrapolation: decision analysis model; assumed all sex acts present an independent risk of HIV acquisition; secondary transmission ignored; base case epidemiological parameters reflect generic US -wide estimates Willingness -to-pay threshold: not indicated Time horizon: 1-year duration of PrEP intervention costs and effectiveness but lifetime economic analysis time horizon Discount rate: 3% discount rate applied for costs occurring beyond 1 year in the future Currency and year: 2012 US$, adjusted using the Medical Care compone nt of the consumer price index Scenarios considered : [1] base case (general MSM): 44% PrEP efficacy, 19% disinhibition; [2] behavioural disinhibitio n (hypothetical scenario where PrEP use leads to riskier sexual behaviour: 15% decrease in condom use,15% increase in sexual encounters, and resulting 15% increase in STI prevalence among those taking PrEP) ; [3] High -adherence: 92% PrEP fumarate drug levels ; [4] High -risk: 35% background HIV prevalence ; [5] High -risk and high -adherence: 35% background HIV prevalence and 92% PrEP efficacy ; [6] Monogamous, sero discordant relationship with QALY : [1] base case $160k/QALY (cost saving to $200k) ; [4] high baseline HIV prevalence $27k (cost saving to $160k) ; [5] high HIV prevalence and high adherence: cost saving (range cost saving t o $10k/QALY) ; [6] monogamous serodiscordant relationships with [7] 100% condom use $840k (range $230k to $2.5 million) sensitivity and uncertainty analysis results : at low adherence and high behavioural disinhibitio n, PrEP was harmful, leading to an increased risk of HIV acquisition; in populations where PrEP adherence was low, ICER exceeded $100k/QALY for all scenarios except those with high HIV prevalence of at least 35% and low behavioural disinhibition (less than 10% change in sexual risk); cost per QALY was more than $100k at 44% PrEP efficacy and HIV prevalence below 25%; at expected adherence (44% PrEP efficacy), ICER was highly dependent on degree of behavioural disinhibition; behavioural disinhibition had little impact on cost - effectiveness when PrEP was taken at high adherence; at high adherence, PrEP becomes cost saving at HIV prevalence above 21%; other parameters with high impact on ICER were baseline risk of HIV acquisition per sex act, QALYs gained pe r case of HIV averted and annual PrE P cost (reducing PrEP cost by 50% in base case to below $4772, PrEP becomes cost - saving) Chen & Dowdy (2014) Conclusion : cost-effectiveness of PrEP highly dependent on condom use, HIV prevalence, PrEP adherence and degree of behavioural disinhibition . Comment: This study focuses on a group with a 19% HIV prevalence, substantially higher than among the all MSM in the UK. HI V incidence was not reported. In addition, the cascade of care for people living with HIV in the US is different from the UK.

Drabo (2015) Conclusion : PrEP and interventions involving an increase in HIV test and earlier initiation of treatment are cost - effective alternatives to the status -quo for HIV prevention in Los Angeles County MSM. When affordable, aggressive combinations of these strategies should be implemented.

Authors highlight importance of identifying high -risk MSM, and suggested questions such as number of sexual partners and consistency of condom use, as these are two key drivers of ri sk of HIV acquisition. 51 $23 plus physician visit $100); cost of HIV testing with antibody test: HIV+ $14; cost of HIV diagnosis $491 untreated symptomatic [4] symptomatic treated with ART $6181 [5] untreated AIDS $21863 [6] AIDS treated with ART $9950; annual non - HIV-related healthcare costs for uninfected and infected individuals? $4061; annual cost of ART $15589 Quality of life values: [1] HIV -, no PrEP 1 [2] 1 [3] 0.72 [6] sed HIV and on ART 0.83 [7] age - specific multiplier 0.96 Limitations : sexual mixing between low - and high -risk MSM not modelled High quality Study population & setting: MSM, people who inject drugs and high risk heterosexuals in New York City (NYC) Study perspective: health care payer perspective Intervention used: Several independent pre -exposure prophylaxis prioritization strategies (PPS) were considered and compared with no Prep and a scenario where Pr EP was available for all HIV negative persons for whom Pr EP might be considered a prevention option: 1) High risk heterosexuals 2) any susceptible MSM 3) High risk MSM 4) people who inject drugs 5)all at risk (any susceptible person from all the above categories). Simulations conducted of every mutually exclusive combination of the PPS (n=12). Identification of combination of PPS delivering the greate st health Incremental cost-per- infection averted Costs : Cost per infection averted under best case scenario is $11 million. Total estimated budgetary cost is $7500 million annually. Hypothetical condition of Pr EP available for al l susceptible (i.e. entire HIV neg ative population of NYC), Cost per infection averted >$54 million. Total estimated budgetary cost for implementation of Pr EP throughout entire population is $52 000 million annually. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis results : Operating characteristics of PreP implementation, including uptake, effectiveness and cost, had profound impact on the value of PrEP, as measured by cost - per-infection averted (>75% difference in cost-per-infection averted) across all PPS; Kessler (2014) Conclusion : PrEP implementation among high -risk MSM could have a significant impact on the HIV epidemic. Prioritisation to high risk MSM could achieve cost savings under set(s) assumptions regarding effectiveness and cost that are potentially a chievable. Further expansion would provide greater impact, but attendant costs may be prohibitive. Comment: Outcomes not presented as QALYs averted. Assumed PrEP efficacy of 44%. 52 benefit with a budget scenario by calculating ICER of all possible combinations of strategies. PrEP efficacy: 44%. Comparator: no PrEP Modelling and statistical extrapolation: Mathematical model integrating equilibrium results from a Monte Carlo simulation of HIV progression with a deterministic compartmental model of HIV transmission. Uptake was assumed to be 50% under initial assumptions. Pr EP was assumed to be immediate and continued for the entirety of the simulation time horizon (20 years) Willingness -to-pay threshold: Threshold of $360 000 per infection averted was selected as cos t-saving. A cost-per-infection averted ratio between $0.36 million and $1 million was considered as likely cost -saving Time horizon: 20 years Discount rate: cos ts and benefits not discounted Currency and year: 2012 US dollars Scenarios considered : Base case scenario (no Pr EP available from 2010) vs best case (all at risk susceptible individuals able to use Pr EP). Other scenarios where Pr EP implemented among different groups (high risk heterosexual, MSM, high risk MSM, people who inject drugs ) Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis : One -way sensitivity analyses on key model parameter inputs Cost: annual PreP costs $9 ,672 estimation (midpoin t between two published estimates) If cost of Pr EP is reduced by 50% ($4 ,836 annually) and uptake of Pr EP is at least 50%, prioritization to all MSM could reach cost savings ; If uptake 90%, cost $4 ,836 annually, effectiveness 75%, prioritisation to all MSM could prevent nearly 50% of new infection ; If uptake is 70 -100% and cost is 50% of initial estimates, prioritization to high -risk MSM would achieve cost savings. Under no scenario investigated was prioritization to high -risk heterosexuals alone cost saving. If PrEP effectiveness was 25%, Pr EP wou ld not be cost saving under any scenario. If prioritised to high risk MSM at lower cost, utilised by majority of co mmunity (50 -100%) and equally effective as initial estimates, it may still be cost-effective . Even if effectiveness of Pr EP was 75%, Pr EP would only be cost saving with high -risk MSM. Limitations : 1) study may have overestimated the actual health benefits of Pr EP assuming that Pr EP use itself does not further modify assumption of sexual identities and behavioural pattern. 2) No stratification of effect of PrEP on HIV transmission by type of sexual partnership or positioning. 3) Did not account for potential improvements over time in Pr EP uptake and/or costs resulting from increased awareness and easier, cheaper regimens becoming available. 53 Correspondence; not possible to ascertain how well the study was conducted Study population & setting: MSM in New York City (epidemic data used), national data; 25% of susceptible and undiagnosed MSM tested for HIV per year (bas ed on model projections corresponding to current epidemic trends) Study perspective: Intervention used: PrEP in all susceptible MSM ; PrEP efficacy 44% but 73% among those who are highly adherent i.e. taking >90% of doses Comparator: Modelling and statist ical extrapolation: dynamic compartmental model that shows changes over time in the number of susceptible and infected individuals and various disease stages of infected individuals; model assumed all susceptible MSM received PrEP Willingness -to-pay thresh old: $50k -$100k/QALY provided more recent estimate $109 - $297k/QALY saved) Time horizon: 20 -year Discount rate: future costs, infections averted and QALYs discounted at 3% per year Currency and year: not reported Scenarios considered: [1] n ormal adherence (PrEP 44%) tenofovir/emtricitabine $22/day; assumed all susceptible MSM received PrEP and quarterly HIV testing and monitoring for adverse events; assumed PrEP costs fully incurred regardless of adherence Cost per QALY gained Costs: of the 160 ,043 susceptible MSM receiving PrEP in the 1st year, the implementation cost was $1.4 billion Estimated benefits: [1] PrEP was associated with 35 ,887 fewer infections over 20 years (61% reduction); [2] if all patients were highly adherent, PrEP was associated with 50,502 fewer infections over no PrEP averaged $1.3 4 billion each year, benefits increased over time: year 1 prevented 1275 infections, saved 3 QALYs, year 20 prevented 1930 (undiscounted) saved d 2,092 infections and saved 5 QALYs compared to no PrEP, year 20 prevented 2,552 (undiscounted) infections and 5 ,328 (discounted) QALYs Koppenhaver (2011) Conclusion: PrEP may have significant impact on HIV epidemic but at a high cost; authors suggested the following factors contributed to high ICER: [1] effectiveness of PrEP reduces HIV prevalence over time, savings in HIV treatment prevented offset by increases in PrEP costs; [2] incremental QALYs saved from PrEP are far greater in the future due to de layed QALYs saved from preventing HIV infections, survival and quality of life in both PrEP and no PrEP arms were similar initially but over time, greater proportion of HIV+ in no PrEP arm led to worse quality of life and more deaths; authors suggested fur ther studies/analyses on differential coverage, dosing regimens/delivery strate gies to highest risk MSM, which could potentially accrue similar benefits to a program in which all MSM receive PrEP but at a much lower cost Comment: Article published in lett ers to the editor in 2 -pages, detailed modelling not presented . 54 Correspondence; not possible to ascertain how well the model/study was conducted Study population & setting: HIV negative MSM attending genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics in England, Year 1 HIV incidence 3.3% Study perspective: NHS England, Clinical Commissioning Groups, and Local Authorities Intervention used: daily oral tenofovir -emtricitabine PrEP for one year Comparator: no PrEP Modelling and statistical extrapolation: decision analytical model incorporating GUM clinic activity data to estimate HIV incidence in year one and subsequently.

The base case analysis assumes that 75% of MSM taking PrEP have detectable drug in each scenario, representing a 75% probability of adherence among MSM taking Modelling and statistical extrapolation: stochastic agent -based model of HIV transmission and progression that tracks HIV transmission within 60 000 men. It simulates the formation of, sexual activity within, and breakup of regular, casual, and group partnerships in the population.

These tables give an indication of how robust the study findings are consi dered to be, and whether they can be considered to be directly generalizable to the UK setting. Biological efficacy would be expecte d to be generaliz able independently but adherence and, therefore, effectiveness are likely to be influenced by healthcare infrastructure , socio -cultural and socio -economic factors. 6.1 MSM / trans women The iPrEx study (Grant et al., 2010) , a high quality phase 3 RCT involving 2499 MSM/ trans women across six countries (USA, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, South Africa and Thailand) showed an age adjusted reduction in new HIV infections of 43% (95% CI: 14% - 62%) in those taking Truvada compared with those on placebo. There was no difference in s yphilis or gonorrhoea rates between the two groups, but the placebo was included to control for risk behaviours. Both groups reported a reduction in the number of sexual partners and an increased use of condoms, which could be explained by the additional health education and safe sex promotion provided by the trial over and above the local standard of prevention care. Self -reported adherence was high at an average of 95% in both groups after 8 weeks, but adherence as measured by detectable drug was low; onl y a quarter of participants in the active arm had drug levels compatible with daily dosing, which almost certainly accounted for the lower reduction in new infections than expected and the wide 95% confidence interval. Pre-specified subgroup analyses, usin g drug detection in the blood, suggested biological efficacy was very high (>90%). The PROUD study (McCormack et al., 2015) looked at the pre-exposure option for reducing HIV in the UK and was an open -label randomization to immediate or deferred daily T ruvada for HIV negative gay men . The pilot phase of the RCT enrolled 544 HIV -negative MSM (1 was a trans woman) through 13 sexual health clinics between November 2012 and April 2014. The 62 median a ge of the study group was 35 years and 81% were in the white ethnic group. One arm (n=275) was offered once daily Truvada from enrolment, and the offer was deferred in the remaining 269 until they had completed 12 months of follow -up. However, the deferred period was terminated early following a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, as PrEP was highly effective at reducing the risk of acquiring HIV (86% (90% CI 64% - 96%; p=0.0001) ), and the risk of HIV in the deferred group was muc h higher than expected (9.0 per 100 person years). Participants incorporated PrEP into their existing risk reduction strategies that continued to include condom use, with no difference in STIs between those on PrEP and those not on PrEP. Reported adherence to Truvada was high and it appeared to be safe and well tolerated, with only 1 of 13 participants who stopped taking it, as a result of an adverse even , not re -starting it. Three out of 6 individuals , who had primary infe ction when they started Truvada , acquired resistance to emtricitabine. No resistance to tenofovir was seen . There are no plans to do any further RCTs in this group as the pilot study demonstrated such a high level of effectiveness. Another well-conducted efficacy study , considered to have an acceptable form of bias, is IPERGAY . This study was undertaken in France and Canada and is reported here as it has been accepted for publication (Molina and et al, 2015, Fonsart et al., 2014) . The IPERGAY study was a double -blind placebo controlled RCT looking at an event -driven use of PrEP (Truvada) versus placebo in MSM in France and Canada. The intermittent dosing involved taking two tablets 2 -24 hours before sex and two further tablets after sex (24 an d 48 hours after the first dose). 414 participants were recruited to the pilot phase; the median age was 35 years and 90% were of white ethnicity. A dherence was assessed by self -report, hair and plasma drug levels . Self -reported adherence by 319 parti cipants across 1212 sex acts was 43% (range 35% -51%) and the median number of pills used by the study population each month was 16 (IQR 10 -23). The placebo arm of this study was halted , on recommendation from the International Drug Monitoring Committee after an interim review , due to high HIV incidence in the 63 placebo arm (6.6 per 100 person years) and a high level of eff ectiveness observed in the group taking PrEP (86%; 95 % CI 40 -99%, p=0.002) . The US MSM Safety trial (Grohskopf et al., 2013) , a phase 2 RCT involving 400 M SM with a median age of 36 years and 79.6% white ethnicity, randomized participants into immediate or delayed once daily Truvada compared to placebo arms. None of those randomized to immediate Truvada acquired HIV during the study period. Adherence was hig h (92% by pill count). Overall, there was a slight decrease in average number of sexual partners (from 7.25 to 5.71 after up to 24 months, p<0.001) and a reduction in the number of HIV positive partners and UAI during follow up. The most commonly reported adverse event (AE) was depression (4 on PrEP and 2 on placebo); there was no difference in grade 3 or 4 AEs between the two groups (adjusted RR 1.08 (95% CI: 0.57 -2.03; p=0.820) and no K65R viral mutations in participants who seroconverted. The recommendation is taken from the PROUD study findings (1+) undertaken on a UK population and the IPERGAY study findings (1+), both of which are considered to be directly applicable to the target population. Although both studies reported a small number of people in the active group who acquired HIV, these five individuals were most likely exposed when not on PrEP. 6.1.1 Recommendation : MSM / trans women (Grade A) PrEP (tenofovir/emtricitabine daily or on demand) is recommended for HIV negative MSM / trans women , in the context of a clinical risk assessment, who fulfil all of the following criteria: Have had a documented negative HIV test in the preceding year ; have had condomless anal intercourse in the previous 3 months ; are anticipated to have condomless anal intercourse in the next 3 months . 64 6.2 Heterosexual /Serodiscordant /Serodifferent Two RCTs (Baeten et al., 2012, Thigpen et al., 2012) achieved high medication adherence and provide d good evidence of the clinical efficacy of daily oral PrEP in preventing HIV acquisition when given to heterosexual men and women at high risk of HIV (TDF2 in heterosexual men and women with mITT efficacy o f 62.2% (15.9 -82.6), and Partners PrEP in men and women in serodiscordant / serodifferent partnerships, where TDF/FTC efficacy was 75% (55-87) and TDF efficacy was 67% (44 -81)). The studies were large, well - conducted, and did not have excessive loss es to follow -up. The findings are therefore likely to be valid. Two RCTs (Fem -PrEP (Van Damme et al., 2012) and Voice (Marrazzo et al., 2015) ), both in heterosexual women, did not provide evidence lea ding to reliable conclusions about the efficacy of daily oral PrEP. Both studies were well-conducted and the null results (and inconsistency when compared to TDF-2 and Partners PrEP) are thought primarily attributable to low adherence to the study drug in the intervention arm. Overall, there was minimal evidence of safety concerns across all four trials (although less than 30% of participants took active drug in Fem-PrEP and VOICE); TDF and TDF/FTC appear safe to take orally on a daily dosing schedule with regular monitoring. Although small changes were observed in eGFR, bone and liver profiles, these were also seen in placebo recipients and there were no significant differences between the PrEP and placebo groups in adverse events other than early gastroint estinal symptoms in the studies. Abnormal laboratory results tended to revert to baseline after discontinuing the drug. To date, there is no evidence that tenofovir alone or Truvada compromise oral or injectable contraceptive efficacy and there is no evide nce that these drugs are associated with abnormal pregnancy outcomes. Although these findings should be interpreted with caution due to small sample size s in the HIV negative populations, the pregnancy outcome data gathered in HIV positive women taking the se drugs as part of the antiretroviral therapy are reassuring. 65 In all studies, small numbers of patients were found to be infected with HIV carrying resistance mutations, the acquisition of which may have been attributable to the selection pressure exerted by PrEP. Patients recently infected and testing negative at enrollment were identified as being at particular risk of acquiring virus with such mutations. These findings suggest national monitoring of HIV resistance must be sustained to support any intend ed PrEP programme in England. TDF-2, Partners PrEP, Fem -PrEP and Voice were all conducted in Sub - Saharan Africa, which limits the extent to which findings can be generalised to England . This is not because of any differences in biological efficacy, but rather because the healthcare systems and access to them as well as HIV incidence are substantially different. The incidence of HIV in the control arms of these studies was 2.0 to 5.0 per 1 00py, which compares to an incidence of 0.17 per 100py in Black Africans attending specialist sexual health services in England. The recommendation is based on two studies rated as 1+ that provided evidence of the clinical efficacy of PrEP in preventing in fection when given to heterosexual men and women at high ris k of HIV , and good e vidence that daily oral dosing wa s safe. 6.2.1 Recommendation : Heterosexual & serodifferent (Grade B) PrEP (daily tenofovir/emtricitabine or tenofovir as a single agent) is recommen ded for the HIV negative partner (confirmed by a documented negative HIV test in the preceding year) of a diagnosed person with HIV who is not known to be virally suppressed and where condomless sex is anticipated. It is also recommended for HIV negative h eterosexual men and women at similar high risk of HIV acquisition, in the context of a clinical risk assessment, where condomless sex is anticipated. 66 6.3 PWID The o ne study among PWID that met all the inclusion criteria wa s the Bangkok Tenofovir Study (Choopanya et al., 2013) . This double blinded placebo controlled RCT recruited 2 ,413 PWID who were HIV negative . This RCT study was graded as 1+ in which there are some concerns of bias. The mITT analysis found a 48.9% reduction in HIV incidence (95% CO 9.6 -72.2; p=0.01) in the PrEP group. The study involved regular contact with participants, and a subset of the population received medication through Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) , which may not feasible to deliver in the real world and may have increased adherence (drug was taken a mean of 83.3% of days (SD 23.0, IQR 79.2 -98.7) ) with no diffe rence by treatment group . Although the study was well designed, the findings are not generalizable to the UK situation. The HIV prevalence among PWID in Thailand is much higher than in the UK, at around 20 -30% (Dutta et al., 2013) compared to around 1% in England (Public Health England and National Infection Service, 2015) . The incidence of HIV among PWID is also likely to be very much higher in Thailand. I n Thailand , amphetamine type stimulant s (ATS) are the predominant type of drug injected; in the UK it is brown heroin (Public Health England et al., 2014) . The drug pre paration and injecting practices associated with these two drugs are different. In particular, ATS are generally injected much more frequently than heroin, and the use of ATS has been associated with increased injecting and sexual risk behaviours (Fischer et al., 2013) . 6.3.1 Recom mendation : People who inject drugs (Grade B) PrEP is not recommended for reducing the risk of HIV acquisition due to injecting drug use because of a lack of evidence that it would be effective for this indication in the UK over and above the existing harm reduction interventions available to people who inject drugs (e.g. needle exchange programmes). 67 6.4 Cost -effectiveness The literature identified seven full -text publications, assessing t he cost - effectiveness of PrEP in high income countries. Most of the papers looked at PrEP delivered to a target group of high -risk MSM, with Juusola et al. (Juusola et al., 2012) and Schneider et al. (Schneider et al., 2014) also evaluating the cost-effectiveness of PrEP given to MSM (without targeting specific higher risk subgroups) ; Kessler et al. (Kessler et al., 2014) included MSM, PWID and high-risk heterosexuals in their target population; and Ouellet et al. (Ouellet et al., 2015) looked at non -PWID MSM. The identified papers considered the MSM population in the US (Chen and Dowdy, 2014, Desai et al., 2008, Juusola et al., 2012, Kessler et al., 2014, Paltiel et al., 2009) , Canada (Ouellet et al., 2015) , and Australia (Schneider et al., 2014) . The level of PrEP efficacy used in base case estimates ranged from around 44% to 50%, although in sensitivity analyse s additional levels of efficacy were considered (e.g. 92% (Chen and Dowdy, 2014) ; 10-90% (Paltiel et al., 2009) ). Four of the publications were based on dynamic models (Desai et al., 2008, Juusola et al., 2012, Kessler et al., 2014, Schneider et al., 2014) , two used a static model (Chen and Dowdy, 2014, Paltiel et al., 2009) and one used number needed to treat based on the iPrEx trial to estimate cost -effectiveness (Ouellet et al., 2015) . These base -case efficacy estimates (44% -50%) were lower than the 86% reported in both the PROUD and IPERGAY trials. In terms of PrEP regimen, all studies assumed a daily regimen although Ouellet et al investigat ed the use of daily dosing for on -demand PrEP, the most expensive on-demand scenario. All of the papers were thought to be of high/acceptable quality using the SIGN checklist ( Appendix 2 ). In the papers that evaluated PrEP targeted at MSM only, t he increme ntal cost - effectiveness ratios (ICER) depended on assumptions about the target population : their age, HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, PrEP drug cost, level of condom use, adherence to PrEP or efficacy , rate of HIV diagnosis in the population and PrEP toxici ty. Four of the papers (Chen and Dowdy, 2014, Juusola et al., 2012, Paltiel et al. , 2009, Schneider et al., 2014) found that the cost of P rEP had a large impact on the ICER. Desai et al. (Desai et al., 2008) noted that the ICER was inversely proportional to the cost of treating an HIV 68 positive patient i.e. the ICER was higher if the cost of treatment was lower. They also found that PrEP coverage ha d important implications for the ICER, as low coverage (2.5% of the very high risk MSM population of New York city, N=1,500) had limited impact on the number of infections prevented, which would not provide sufficient justification for investing in a PrEP programme. Juusola et al. (Juusola et al., 2012 ) highlighted the potential challenge of whether it would be realistic to offer PrEP by risk level, the potential challenge of identifying the target populati on, and questioned how policy could be implemented selectively to prioritise access to PrEP given the substantial budgetary implications. Kessler et al. (Kessler et al., 2014) estimated the cost per infection averted of five different PrEP strategies: 1. high-risk HIV negative heterose xuals; 2. any MSM; 3. high-risk MSM only; 4. susceptible PWID only; 5. all at risk (any susceptible person from all the above categories . They did not find any scenario in which prioritising high-risk heterosexuals alone was cost- saving. However, they found that prioritizing high-risk MS M could be cost - saving under certain assumptions . Further expansion of PrEP to high risk groups other than MSM would provide greater impact on the HIV epide mic but the associated costs might be prohibitive. Two analyses (Cambiano et al., 2015, Ong et al., 2015) specific to the UK MSM context have been developed to estimate PrEP cost effectiveness and to explore the sensitivity of cost -effectiveness to changes in critical conditions. The abstrac t by Cambiano et al. (Cambiano et al., 2015) was based on a UK - based dynamic model. The authors concluded that PrEP use among MSM was cost -effective when targeted at MSM reporting five or more condomless sex partners in the last year, when presenting with a bacterial STI, or in men having condomless sex if the cost of antiret rovirals (for treatment and for use as PrEP) was reduced by 50% of the current (2015) British National Formulary list pric e. The abstract by Ong et al. (Ong et al., 2015) used a s tatic model to evaluate cost -effectiveness of a one -year programme offered to selected GUM clinic attendees in England. The authors concurred with Cambiano et al in concluding that a substantial price reduction of anti -retroviral drugs used for 69 PrEP would provide the necessary assurance of cost -effectiveness for an affordable public health programme of sufficient size. The cost -effectiveness and budgetary impact of PrEP provision are being calculated for inclusion in the integrated impact assessment. 70 7 References ANDERSON, J. & COOPER, D. 2009.

Topic details Intervention : Pre exposure prophylaxis Indication: prevention of HIV Programme of Care : Blood and infection Clinical Reference Group : HIV Accountable Co mmissioner : Claire Foreman Unique Reference Number (URN) : F03X06 2. Background Pre Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) involves use of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in HIV negative individuals who are at ongoing high risk of acquiring the disease. The aim is to prevent primary infection. NHS England is the commissioner of all ARVs irrespective of use and for the treatment and care of all HIV positive individuals. Local Authorities are currently responsible for commissioning HIV prevention International studies have found that PrEP is an effective int ervention for those populations at highest ri sk of infection, such as men who have sex with men (MSM). and heterosexual / serodifferent couples (who have different HIV status) . The mechanism of ARV prevention of HIV is through inhibition of replication of the HIV virus as it enters the body, which hel ps stop the virus from establishing permanent infection. There remain several outstanding questions about exactly how a service would be organised - the exact commissioning criteria for access and the cost-effectiveness of PrEP. Search strategy Search strategy Indicate all terms used in the search P - Patients / Population Which patients or populations of patients are we interested in? How can they be best described? Are there subgroups that need to be HIV negative adult populations , particularly those that have a higher risk of exposure to the virus and /or in whom incidence and prevalence is higher than that in the general population. These groups include MSM, injecting drug users and sex workers and their clients. 80 considered? I - Intervention Which intervention, treatment or approach should be used? All available ARVs used for PrEP and all available regimens (e.g. continuous or intermittent). C - Comparison What is/are the main alternative/s to compare with the intervention being considered? Placebo, no -PrEP, PEP, condoms, behavioural interventions O - Outcomes What is really important for the patient? Which outcomes should be considered? Examples include intermediate or short -term outcomes; mortality; morbidity and quality of life; treatme nt complications; adverse effects; rates of relapse; late morbidity and re-admission; return to work, physical and social functioning, resource use. Critical to decision -making: Numbers who acquire HIV while on PrEP and exposed to HIV Numbers in whom HIV is prevented while on PrEP and exposed to HIV Impact on risk compensation /STIs Important to decision making : Safety measures e.g. adverse events, abnormal biomarkers Measures of cost -effectiveness Measures of adherence to treatment regime Quality of life measures (including physical and social functioning) Treatment failure Drug resistance Measures of unplanned health care e.g. emergency admissions Equality of access (to treatment) Assumptions / limits applied to search Inclusion and exclusion cr iteria e.g. study design, date limits, p atients, intervention, language, setting, country etc. Study types: Systematic review and meta -analysis RCT Other controlled trials Non-controlled trials Guidelines Limits: Humans; English language Published in a peer-reviewed journal or presented as an abstract at a scientific conference between October 2004 and October 2014 (when this review was undertaken) Published in a peer -reviewed journal or presented as an abstract at a scientific conference 81 between 2004 an d the present 3. Research Questions Which patient groups are shown to benefit? What criteria for access were used in the studies? How much was the benefit compared to available alternatives? Which is the most effective combination of antiretrovirals for PrEP? What does PrEP depend on to be effective? What are the factors which impact on cost-effectiveness ? What are the factors which impact on clinical effectiveness? Is it transferable into a real world setting on an ongoing ba sis? What are the pathway components of the intervention? What is the impact on other health concerns / risk compensation? 4.
