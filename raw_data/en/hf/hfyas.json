The life - cycle, parasitology and immunology of T. solium are complex, involving pigs (the intermediate host, harbouring the larval metacestod e stage), humans (the definitive host, harbouring the adult tapeworm, in addition to acting as accidental intermedi ate hosts) and the environment (the source of infection with eggs/proglottids) . We review the parasitology, immunology, and epidemiology of t he infection associated with each of the T. solium life - cycle stages, including the pre - adult/adult tapeworm responsible for human taeniasis; post - oncosphere and cysticercus associated with porcine and human cysticercosis, and the biological characteristic s of eggs in the environment. We discuss the burden associated , in endemic settings, with neurocysticercosis (NCC) in humans, and the broader cross - sector al economic impact associated both with NCC and porcine cysticercosis , the latter impacting food - val ue chains . Existing tools for diagnostics and control interventions that target different stages of the T. solium transmission cycle are reviewed and their limitations discussed. Currently , no national T. solium control programmes have been established in Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 3 en demic areas , with further work required to identify optimal strate gies according to epidemiological setting . T here is increasing evidence suggest ing that cross - sector al interventions which target the parasite in both the human and pig host provide the most effective approaches for achieving control and ultimately elimination . We discuss future avenues for research on T. solium to support the attainement of the goals proposed in the revised World Health Organization neglected tropical diseases roadmap for 20 21 - 2030 adopted at the 73 rd World Health Assembly in November 2020 . Key - words: solium , also known as the pork tapeworm, is a species of parasitic tapeworm Approximately 20 species ar e included in the Taenia genus along with T. solium , including T. measles), T. pisiformis (canine tapeworm) (Pawlowski, 2002) and the more recently characterised T. asiatica (pork tapeworm exhibiting a T. saginata - like morphology and geographically restricted to Asia) ( Gal\u00e1n - Puchades and Fuentes, 2013 ) . All Taenia species involve multi - host systems ; however only T. solium , T. saginat a and T. asiatica are zoonotic, involving human hosts as a component of their life - cycle ( Gal\u00e1n - Puchades and Fuentes, 2013 ; Eom ., 20 20 ) . T aenia solium is widely endemic across Meso and South America, sub - Saharan Africa, and Central and East Asia, ba sed on country - level classification for strong evidence indicating presence of the full transmission cycle ( Fig. 1 ) ) . Regionally, the most recent literature - based mapping work has identified that T. solium is present in 31 of 54 count ries in Africa ( Braae et al . , 2015 b ) , 16 of 41 countries in Central America and the Caribbean Basin ( with reports of porcine cysticercosis in 11 departments across Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Venezuela ( Braae et al. , 2017 a ) ) countries for T. solium porcine cysticercosis across East and Southeast Asia (Cambodia, China, East Timor, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Mongolia, Myanmar and Vietnam) ( Braae et al. , 2018 a ) . There is substantial geograph ic al overlap with other Taenia species, for example with T. saginata , which is present across the Americas Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 5 ( Braae Dermauw et et , 2019; Saratsis et a l. , 2019 ) and Asia ( Torgerson et al. , ) . Figure 1.

TAENIA SOLIUM BIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY A number of stages are involved in the development of T. solium , including pre - adult tapeworm and reproductive adult tapeworm stages in the definitive human host, an egg stage in the environment, and the cy sticercus stage in the intermediate porcine host ( Pawlowski, 2002 ) . Fig. 2 illustrates the life - cycle of T. solium . Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 6 Figure 2. Life - cycle of Taenia solium showing the main stages in the human, pig host and environment. Reproduced from Rasamoelina - Andriamanivo e t al . (2013) . 2.1. H uman taeniasis: pre - adult and adult tapeworm parasitology and immunology Consumption of undercooked or raw pork meat, infec ted with cysticerci, leads to adult tapeworm infection in the definitive human host. Within the human intestine, the cysticerc us loses its bladder wall and the scolex evaginates, enabling attachment to the intestinal mucosa by the hooks and suckers located on the scolex ( Rabiela et al. , 2000 ) . The duration of the process of development from successful invasion and evagination of the cysticerc us to a fully mature and reproductively competent adult (the pre - adult tapeworm stage) is 2 - 4 months ( Pawlowski, 2002 ; Flisser, 2013 ) . A crucial T. solium - derived protein called Taenia solium calreti c ulin, expressed in the suckers and rostellum, may be involved in the modulation of the Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 7 host immune system during definitive - host infection (Flisser et al. , 2010) . An adult t apeworm measures approximately 1.5 - 4 m in length ( Flisser, 2013; Garcia et al . , 2014 with the scolex and neck preceding the elongated, ribbon - shaped strobila (or the main body segments) which consists of 700 - 1 , 000 proglottid segments ( Pawlowski, 2002; Fl isser, 2013 ) . These segments will be of different shape, size and stage of development, with small immature proglottids located nearest to the scolex, followed by the mature proglottids which contain both testes and ovary lobes, hence making organism F inally , the gravid segments , containing 50,000 - eggs each ( Pawlowski, 2002; Flisser, 2013 ) , are located furthest from the scolex, at the end of the strobila. A number of animal models are currently available to study hos t immunity and variability in susceptibly to T. the only anim al model in which adult tapeworms become gravid and produce viable eggs capable of onward infectivity ( Maravilla et al. , 2011 ) . These models have demonstrated an initial host immune response in the intestinal mucosa involving both subsets of T - helper cells (Th1/Th2), followed by a shift towards a Th2 immune response as adult worm expulsion begins from the host ( \u00c1vila et al. , 2008 ) . While it is generally considered that the majority of human taeniasis infections involve a single tapeworm ( Pawlowski, 2002 ) , m ultiple infections have been reported . A study in China , for example, identified that of 42 T. solium taeniasis cases in school - age children, 12 harboured multiple tapeworms, with one individual hosting 11 adult tapeworms ( Li et al. , 2019 ) . Eggs are relea sed into the environment via the faeces freely or within the detached gravid proglottids by apolysis, approximately 2 - 3 times per week ( Pawlowski, 2002; Flisser, Craig and Ito, 2011 ) , with each adult worm capable of shedding up to 300,000 eggs per day ( Paw lowski, 2002 ) . Specific tapeworm proteins of copro - antigens, which are Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 8 genus - specific parasite products associated with metabolism, and are found in the faeces of infected hosts independent of the presence of eggs and proglottids ( Allan et al. ) . These antigens (Ag) form the target for the widely used enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (copro - Ag - ELISA) ( Allan et al. , 1990 ) , specifically the assay developed from hyperimmunized rabbit - derived polyclonal antibodies with either adult worm excretion - secretion (ES) or somatic products ( Allan Taenia infection using the copro - Ag - ELISA can be detected as early as 2 weeks post - infection, i.e. before progl ottid patency ( Tembo and Craig, 2015 ) , which occur s 86 days post - infection as reported by Tembo and Craig (2015) . This highlight s the ability of the copro - Ag - ELISA test to detect immature tapeworms and explain s why this assay reports approximately 2.5 time s more cases than other methods which detect reproductive stages, such as coprology/microscopy to detect eggs ( Mwape and Gabri\u00ebl, 2014 ) . Other ES products expressed by the adult tapeworm ( Wilkins et al. , 1999 ) , ES33 and ES38 , 200 4 , 2007 ) , have been used as targets for antibody - based diagnostics including an immunoblot assay. Evidence suggests that adult tapeworms live for less than five years ( Garcia et al ., 2014 ) . This estimate is based on observations following the return of Bri tish soldiers from a military tour of India whereby significant numbers of soldiers or their immediate relatives developed neurological disease due to neurocysticercosis (NCC) approximately 2 - 5 years later, but only very few tapeworm carriers were identifi ed after five years amongst this cohort ( Mac Arthur, 1934; Dixon and Hargreaves, 1944; Dixon and Lipscomb, 1962 ) . 2.2. Human taeniasis: epidemiology and risk factors Prevalence surveys indicate that human taeniasis prevalence due to T. solium is s u b stantially lower than the prevalence of infection by the other parasite stages ( i.e., porcine and human Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 9 cysticercosis). As measured by antigen detection in stool with the copro - Ag - ELISA, prevalence ranges from 1.5 % to 23.4% across settings ( Rodriguez - Canul et al. , 19 99; Garcia et al. , 2003 b ; Raghava et al. , 2010; Mwape al. , 2012, the majority of studies (6/9) show s a prevalence of approximately 3% or less ( Rodriguez - Canul et al. , 1999; G arcia et al. b al. , 2010; al. , et al. , 2014 ) . Seroprevalence based on antibodies against T. solium tapeworm ranges from 2.3 % to 2.9% ( Holt et al. , 2016 ) . Stool examination - based surveys have report ed prevalence ( Vora et al. , 2008 ) , and an positive/self - reported survey reported prevalence ( Conlan et al. , 2012 ) . Exploring risk factors for T. solium taeniasis in humans is challenging given the low prevalence of infection in most settings . The low number of positives therefore requires a substantial sample size to explore associations with potential risk factors ( Rodriguez - Canul et al. , 1999; Mohan et al. , 2014 ) . Identified risk factors ( Table 1 ) statistically significantly associated with human T. solium taeniasis by antigen positivity (copro - Ag - ELISA) include: i) household overcrowding (of more than six people) , identified through a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis of risk variables in Zambia ( Mwape et al. , 2015 ) ; ii) in dividuals frequently consuming pork tongue in Vietnam (Odds Ratio (OR) = 4.62, 95% CI = 1.49 - 14.3) ( Ng - Nguyen et al. , 2018 c ) , and iii) consumption of undercooked pork in India (OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.19 - 5.94) , with positivity measured by stool examination a nd ) . Copro - Ag - ELISA positivity was also significantly associated with iv) individuals belonging to households containing an infected pig (lingual palpation and serology confirmed) in Mexico (ch i - squared = 17.81, p - value = 0.005) ( Rodriguez - Canul et al. , 1999 ) ; v) history of passing tapeworm segments in stool (OR = 3.31, 95% CI= 2007 ) , and vi) members with = 17.12, 95% CI= 1.51 - 194.21) ) . Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 10 Age - related associations and trends in human taeniasis have been identified across geographical settings ( Garcia et al. , 2003 b ; Prasad , infection peaks in younger individ uals have been observed, with copro - Ag - ELISA prevalence statistically significantly associated with age (p - value < 0.05) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) ( Madinga et al. , 2017 ) . Evidence includ es the observation of: a) hig hest prevalence and age peaks in those less than 10 years of age in the DRC ( Madinga et al. , 2017 ) ; b) individuals being < 55 years identified as an important determinant in the CART analysis in one of two districts analysed in Zambia ( Mwape et al. , 2015 ) , and c) a significant copro - Ag - ELISA positivity peak in those less than 10 years of age compared to other age groups (p - value = 0.042) in Peru ( Garcia et al. , 2003 b ) . In Guatemala, prevalence initially increase s with age, followed by a sharp decrease after 30 years of age ( Allan et al. , 1996 ) . By contrast , a few studies have identified age - infection peaks in older age groups, with stool examination prevalence peaking in 45 - 55 year olds in India ( Vora et al. , 2008 ) of being stool examination/mu ltiplex PCR - positive being higher in those over 15 years of age (OR = 1.47, 95% CI= 1.01 - 2.13) also et al. , 2007 ) . Sex is also associated with risk of infection in Asia, with the male sex being statistically significantly and positively a ssociated (OR = 2.20, 95% CI= 1.34 - 3.63) al. , 2012 ) . However, this was based on egg - positivity and self - reporting, which can introduce substantial measurement bias. Males also had significantly higher odds of being Taenia species - posi tive based on microscopy/multiplex PCR (OR = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.00 - 7.68) in Vietnam ( Ng - Nguyen et al. , 2018 c ) . A number of studies, especially those conducted in Asia , where other Taenia species are highly prevalent, have either used diagnostics which are un able to differentiate between Taenia species (e.g. microscopy, self - reporting), or only report associations with all aggregated Taenia species identified, rather Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 11 than with individual species, even when adopting molecular methods of detection ( Prasad et al. , 2007; Ng - Nguyen et al. , 2018 c ; Li et al. , 2019 ) . A further feature of human taeniasis infection epidemiology is spatial clustering of infection . A large cluster of copro - Ag - ELISA positive cases was identified in Zambia using a risk - adjusted nearest neig hbour hierarchical spatial clustering method ( Mwape et al. , 2012 ) . I n the DRC two statistically significant clusters (total sample n = 276 and n = 9 , respectively , p - value < 0.001) were identified by Madinga et al. (2017) using (Ripley's) K functions . (Rip ley's K functions ( Ripley, 1981 ) are used to quantify significant spatial clustering of infection indicators over and above what would be expected due to natural environmental heterogeneity. ) In Peru. residents were more likely to be copro - antigen positive if living within 100 m of a tongue - positive pig (p - value = 0.02) ( O'Neal et al. , 2012 ) . Significant hotspots, based on stool examination/copro - Ag - ELISA were identified in India ( using the spatial scan statistic s software SaTScan TM ), with Relative R isk (RR ) = 36.67 ( p - value = software that analys es spatial, tempor al and space - time data using spatial, temporal, or space - time scan statistics .)

Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 13 2.3. Eggs in the environment: biological characterist ics T aenia solium eggs (from which the oncospheres will hatch, Singh et al ., 2020 ) , are spherical or radial in appearance and found individually or within gravid proglottids. While eggs can be identified through traditional stool examination, it is impossi ble to discriminate T. solium eggs morphologically from those of T. saginata and other species Jeri et al. , 2004 ) . The oncosphere is surrounded by a protective embryophore, measuring approximately 26 - 43 m in diameter ( Yoshino, 1933c; Flisser, 2013 ) to protect against external factors in the environment. This stage is known as the hexacanth embryo, as six embryonic hooklets are located on the oncosphere. Eggs r eleased from the human gut will be at a range of development al stages: i) some still devel oping (although the capability of further maturation of immature eggs in the environment is debated ( Alvarez Rojas et al . , 2018 ) ); ii) those which are readily infective to the intermediate host; and iii) non - infective or senile eggs, which are hypothesised to serve as immunizing factors if consumed by the intermediate host ( Pawlowski, 2002 ) . Most of the research to assess extrinsic factors affecting survival and viability of taeniid eggs has been conducted in other species. Essential extrinsic factors, mai nly examined in T. saginata ( Murrell, 2005 ) , include: whether oncospheres are located in the proglottids or isolated (tested under lab conditions) ( Suvorov, 1965 ) ; humidity ( Silverman and Maneely, ) ; temperature, and seasonal factors ( Rukhova, 1963; Bu cur et al. , 2019 ) . Studies of longevity of T. saginata eggs have shown that a small proportion of them remain s infective for approximately six months in natural soil conditions , in Denmark ( Ilsoe et al. , 1990 ) . U nder different climatic conditions they can, approximately, survive for: i) 10 months in damp temperate climates ( Shekhovstov, 1975 ) ; ii) up to five months in winter and spring; Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 14 iii) up to nine months warm climates in summer/autumn ( Rukhova, 1963 ) , and iv) up to days in water ( Shekhovstov, 19 75 ) . Mechanisms of dispersal for T. solium eggs have also been explored, implicating dung beetles as a key dispersal vector in Peru ( Arriola et al ., 2014; - Puerta 2014; Gomez - Puerta et al . , 2018 ; Vargas - Calla et al ., 2018 ) . Studies have docume nted rubripes ) as an intermediate host, were statistically significantly associated with presence of cysticerc us - antibod y positivity in pigs (OR = 4.30, 95% CI = 1.83 - 10.09 and OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.50 - 3.28 Gomez Puerta et al . (2014) established that T. solium viable eggs could be carried in the digestive system of Am. rubripes dung be etles for up to 39 days with approximately 40% viability at 24 days post - infection. Ammophorus rubripes harbouring T. solium eggs have been captured from villages in Piura, Northern Peru ( Vargas - Calla et al. , 2018 ) , while cysticercosis has developed in pig s orally challenged with Am. rubripes harbouring T. solium eggs ( and immunology Consumption of infective material (released mature individual eggs and gravid proglottids) by the porcine intermediate host results in development of porcine cysticercosis. Once ingested, oncospheres hatch and are exposed to bile and enzymes which disaggregate the embryophoric structure, permitting dissolution of the onco spheral membrane and activation of mature oncospheres in ( Pawlowski, 2002; Flisser, 2013 ) . Oncosphere - derived enzymes and hooks located on the surface enable crossing through the intestinal mucosa, whereby activated oncospheres are able to enter sub - mucosal blood and/or lymphatic Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 15 vessels for further dissemination ( Pawlowski, 2002; Flisser, 2013 ) . Migration occurs to predilection sites including the skeletal and cardiac muscles, brain and sub - cutaneous tissue, where the oncospheral stage init iates the process of metacestode (or larval - stage) development into mature vesicular (viable) cysticerci. Pawlowski (2002) described a post - oncospheral . H owever, Rodr \u00ed guez et al . (2006) did not find evidence for a post - oncospheral stage, defined as a n intermediate embryonic latent stage capable of dividing and migrating to further host muscles and tissues. Yoshino was the first to examine post - embryonal metacestode development in the porcine host , b , c ) , with the process of maturation ta king 2 - 3 months ( Yoshino, 1933b; Verastegui of metaces t odes are evident in tissues very early (2 - 6 days post - infection) in these original studies ( Yoshino, 1933b ) . M ore recent work suggests , however, that cysticerci are first detectable macroscopically at 14 days post - infection ( Garrido et . , testosterone has been hypothesised to be important in cysticerc al growth and development, as demonstrated for T. crassiceps ( Romano et al. , 2003 ) . When maturation is achieved, the cysticerci develop into small (0.5 - 1.5cm), spherical or oval vesicle s containing an invaginated scolex within an inner chamber and an outer chamber comprising the vesicular fluid, which is enclosed by a translucent bladder wall ( Pawlowski, 2002; Flisser, 2013 ) . This stage and in the porcine host is morphologically characterised as a cellulose - type cysticerc us ( Flisser, 2013 ) (which gives rise to the name Cysticercus cellulosae ). Direct observation of (viable) c ysticerci in pigs can either by undertaken by the simplest method of tongue inspection (lingual palpation), although this is likely to miss animals with low infection burdens ( Sciutto et al. , 1998 ) , or by the more - intensive necropsy - based approach , with su bsequent inspection of carcass tissues ( taeniasis/cysticercosis 16 A number of host - derived proteins have been implicated in cysticerc al growth, survival and permanence . These include in vitro identifica tion of transforming growth factor - (TGF and the localisation of intermediate - host haptoglobin and haemoglobin in cysticerc al vesicular fluid , with t he ability to bind to cysticercal receptors ( Navarrete - Perea et al. , 201 4, 2016 ) . Victor et al . (2012) further characterised the proteome of ES proteins produced by T. solium cysticerci, reporting 76 proteins including 27 T. solium - derived proteins and a further 32 likely to be of T. solium origin , with the majority likely inv olved in parasite survival (the remaining 17 were of host origin). ES proteins are also important parasite targets for porcine cysticercosis serological diagnostics, including the monoclonal antibodies selected against these proteins in the antigen - ELISA ( Ag - ELISA) assays ( Harrison et Dorny et al. , 2000 ) . Antibody - based diagnostics, such as the widely used immunoblot format ( Tsang et al ., 1989 ) , also target extracellular secreted proteins in the 8 - kDa glycoprotein family located in the vesicular fluid, alongside other anchor - membrane proteins and integral membrane proteins ( Hancock et al. , 2004, 2006; Garcia et al. , 2018 ) . Other immune evasion and mitigation strategies employed by the metacestode stage may also involve host lymphocyte apoptosis in duced by parasite - expressed cysteine proteases in the inflammatory reaction surrounding both pig musculature brain metacestodes ( Solano et NCC, with localisation of the cys ticerci in the central nervous system (CNS). Work in Tanzania has demonstrated that naturally - infected pigs with NCC develop clinical signs and seizures comparable to human NCC, with older pigs more likely to have degenerating cysts and suffer seizures ( Tr evisan et al. , 2016 ) , alongside alterations of behaviours in infected sows including less time spent feeding and increased social isolation ( Trevisan, et al. , 2017 a ) . This earlier work by Mkupasi et al . (2015) , who found mainly viable cysts wit h Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 17 mostly mild/moderate inflammation in older pigs. The authors suggested, based on these findings, that pigs are more adapted to larval - stage infection (as the y are the natural intermediate host), although the authors did not control for the time of exposu re. The efficiency of establishment of T. solium eggs in the porcine host ( proportion of eggs establishing and develop ing to metacestode infection) ranges from 0.94 % to 5% of all ingested eggs using an 8,400 - 15,000 egg input ( Flisser et al ., 1979 ; Molinar al . ( 1991 ) identified a 0.28% infection efficiency using 10 - 20,000 eggs with 20% viability. A low - intensity porcine cysticercosis infection model (median of 2 - 40 cysts per pig) has also been developed with susceptible pigs ingesting Ammophorus rubripes beetles harbouring 1 2 - 5 2 eggs (beetles all exposed to a single proglottid) ( Gomez et Santamaria et These studies suggest that egg viab ility before challenge should be determined, not always the case in historical studies, in order to calculate reliably the efficiency of establishment (and determining whether this would be positively or negatively density dependent) . Santamaria et al . (20 02) estimated that after challenge with eggs of 80% viability, the percentage of pigs infected at approximately 2 - 4 months (determined by necropsy ) was approximately 8 7 %. In addition, pigs receiving small doses (10 or 100 eggs) harboured caseous (inactive) cysticerci, indicating that the host immune system had killed the metacestode in a relatively short period, compared to mainly vesicular, infective cysticerci, also found in the brain, in those pigs receiving higher doses (1,000 eggs or more) ( Santamaria et al . , 2002 ) . Antibodies were also detected in 40 - 75% of pigs in the lower - dose group, whereas 100% of pigs developed an antibody response in the higher - dose group, suggesting humoral immunity is related to the development al stage of the metacestode and t he severity (intensity) of the infection input . A correlation between circulating Ag titre and number of viable cysts has also been Conlan et . (2009) suggested that acquired immunity to T. solium can be elicited follow ing ingestion of eggs ( de Aluja et al. 2008 ) , as either pre - or post - encystment immunity was demonstrated for other Taenia species ( Lightowlers and Rickard, 1993 ) . Equally, a r ole of age at primary egg exposure has been suggested in relation to the robustness of the innate immune response ( Conlan et al. , 2009 ) . This was motivated by the study of Deckers et al . (2008) , wh o found , in na\u00efve pigs (and at 3 months post - infection), th e presence of 98% viable cysts when the pigs were infected at 1 month of age , 45% viable cysts when pigs were infected at 3 months of age, but mostly degenerated cysts (1.5% viable) when pigs were infected at 5 months of age . Maternal protection from anti bodies passed from sow to offspring via colostrum has been documented . In studies conducted in Peru, m aternally - derived IgG antibodies were detected at 7 months (28 weeks) of age ( against synthetic peptides ) ( Handali et al. , 2004 ) , and even at 35 weeks (27 weeks after weaning) ( Gonzalez et al. , 1999 ) . A study in Zambia , however, only found maternally - derived antibodies up to 2 months of age ( Sikasunge et al. , 2010 ) . Both in Peru and Zambia, it was documented that the majority of IgG antibodies began waning from 8 to 14 weeks of age ( Gonzalez et al. , 1999; ) . and risk factors Estimates of porcine cysticercosis (sero)prevalence vary significantly given location and type of diagnostic used. Prevalence b y a ntibody - based measurement is generally higher than other prevalence indicators, as this diagnostic measures exposure rather than active infection, with seroprevalence estimates ranging from 3.2 % to 76% ( Rodriguez - Canul et al. , 1998; Garcia et al. , 1999, 2003 a ; al. , Lescano et Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 19 al. , 2007, 2019; Jayashi et al. , 2012 b ; Mohan et al. , 2013; Pray et al. , 2017; Morales et al. 2018; Ng - Nguyen et al. , 2018 a,b ; Rojas et al. , 2019 ) . Measurement of antigen is more closely associated with being a marker of active infection, ranging from 4.7 % to 59% seroprevalence ( Carrique - Mas et al. , 2008 c ; 2010a et al. , 2019 ) . Prevalence estimated from direct observation of cysts, through lingual palpat ion , range s from 5.85 % to 33% ( Rodriguez - Canul et al. , 1999; al. , 2002, et at necropsy or meat inspectio n (including retrospective review of records) ranges from 3.94 % to 29.10% ( Porphyre et 2019 ) . Many studies have been conducted to as sess risk factors associated with T. solium porcine cysticercosis infection ( Table 2 ). Across sub - Saharan Africa, Meso and South America, and Asia, studies show that the type of husbandry system, with predominantly free - range systems, was significantly ass ociated with porcine cysticercosis exposure/infection indicated by antibody, antigen, lingual palpation and meat - inspection - based (sero)positivity (ORs ranging from 1.68 to 42 across studies, p - value(s) < 0.05) ( Sikasunge et al. , 2018 ) . Antigen seropositivity was also significantly associated with absence of pig pens (OR = 0.446, 95% CI = 0.231 - was significantly associated with the periods when farmers enable free - roaming behaviour (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3 - 3.6) ( Komba et al. , 2013 ) . In addition, factors related to the type of material used for, and structure of pig pens are s ignificantly associated with positivity . A ntigen seropositivity has been found to be positively and significantly associated with : a) presence of slatted, raised floors (OR = 8.4, 95% CI = 1.0 - 70.0) ( Komba et al. , 2013 ) ; b) pigs kept in raised pens (OR = 5 .33, 95% CI = 1.08 - 32.27), and c) dirt floors compared to cement floors (OR = 9.87, 95%CI = 1.29 - 114.55) ( Braae et al. , 2015 a ) , in Tanzania . Besides, type of feedstuff has also been reported as a significant risk factor ( e.g., feeding potato peels conjectu red to be contaminated with eggs; OR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.43 - 8.79) , also in Tanzania ( Braae et al. , 2015 a ) . Availability/usage of latrines and poor sanitation have also been identified as significant risk factors. Antigen seropositivity was significantly as sociated with (non) usage of latrines in Tanzania (OR = 2.04, 95% Bayesian credible interval (95% BCI) = 1.25 - 3.45) in one study ( Ngowi et al. , 2004 ) and another study 5.98, 95% = 1.33 - , 2015 a ) , while open defecation practices were also significantly associated in Tanzania (p - value = 0.0001) ( Shonyela et al. , 2017 ) positivity was significantly associated with (non) latrine use in South Africa (p - value = 0.006) ( Krecek et al. , 2012 ) , and to u se latr ines; 0.576, 95% . In Mexico, absence of latrines was significantly associated with lingua l palpation positivity (two studies; OR = 2.37, p - ( Widdowson et al. , 2000 ) , and OR = 2.4, p - value < 0.001 ( M orales et al. , 2008 a ) ) . I n Peru, presence of latrines in households decreased the odds of antibody seropositivity (OR = 0.51, 95%CI = 0.39 b ) (summarised in Table 2 ). Finally, the odds of antigen seroposit i vity significantly decr eased with improved sanitation and hygiene practices in Tanzania (OR = 0.19, 95%CI = 0.04 - 0.34) ( Maganira et al. , 2019 ) . Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 21 Water - source provision was also identified as a significant risk factor; for example, lingual palpation/antigen (sero)positivity was s tatistically significantly associated with sourcing of water in Tanzania (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.6 - 6.3) ( Komba et al. , 2013 ) . A ntigen seropositivity was significantly and negatively associated with provision of protected water sources (acting as a protective factor) in Uganda (OR = 0.525, p - value = 0.350 - 0.787) ( Kung u et al. , 2017 a ) . Other significant factors associated with antigen positivity included knowledge of the transmission cycle, which acts as a protective factor in smallholder pig production systems in Uganda (OR = 0.476, , 2010 a ) . Household overcrowding with more than six people (OR = 1.75, p - value = 0.034) ( Widdowson et al. , 2000 Morales , 2018 ) ( OR = 1.95 , p - value = 0.001) were significantly associated with porcine cysticercosis antibody seropositivity in Mexico.

G eographical P ositioning S ystem (GPS) studies looking at roaming behaviours: in West Kenya ( Thomas et al. , 2013 ) ; in Northern Peru ( 2019 ) . Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 24 The age of the pig host was identified as a risk factor in Sub - Saharan Africa for antigen seropositivity, with increasing age in Mozambique (OR = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.13 - 2.37) ( Pondja et , 2010 ) and Tanzania (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.2 - 3.0) ( Komba , 2013 ) . I n Cameroon , a significantly higher seroprevalence was associated with pigs over 1 year of age ( Pouedet et al. , 2002 ) . In Bolivia, pigs over two year s of age were significantly associated with antigen seropositivity compared to those aged 2 - 7 months (OR = 3.83; 95% CI = 1.01 - 16.31) ( Carrique - Mas et al. , 2001 ) . In Peru, the risk of being antibody seropositive significantly increased by 7% for every addi tional month of pig age (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.05 - 1.09) ( Jayashi et al. , 2012 b ) . I n a separate study , also in Peru, antibody seroprevalence increased monotonically with age (s imilarly for both sexes) , although this was not statistically tested ( Garcia et a l. , 2003 b ) . Lingual palpation positivity was also significantly associated with increasing age in Nigeria (p - value < 0.05) ( Gweba et al. , 2010 ) and in Mexico (p - value < 0.05) ( Sarti et al. , 1992 ) . also suppo rtive of this trend . I n Peru, s ignificantly increasing odds of necropsy positivity were significantly associated with pig age for any infection , with the following ORs per additional month of age: low - infection intensity ( >1 cyst ; OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.04 - 1.12), moderate - heavy infection (>10 cysts; OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.03 - 1.13) , and heavy infection (>100 cysts; OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.01 - 1.14) ( Pray et al. , 2017 ) . On the other hand, studies in Honduras ( Sakai et al. , 2001 ) and Mexico ( Widdowson et al. , 2000 ) did not find an association b etween pig age and antibody seroprevalence, while one study in Mexico ( Rodriguez - Canul et al. , 1999 ) showed that antibody seroprevalence decreased statistically significantly with age (chi squared - test for trend = 7.803; p - value = 0.006), with the highest exposure in the youngest age group. Other necropsy datasets, such as those from Nepal ( Sah et al. , 2017 ; Poudel et al. , 2019 ) suggest prevalence does not increase Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 25 with age . As these age - profiles are restricted to animals of slaughter age, it is difficult t o infer trends across the full age - range. The sex of the pig is also a significant risk factor i n some settings , with female pigs generally being at higher risk of infection. Such evidence includes : a) higher antigen seroprevalence in females in Tanzania (p - value = 0.01) ; b) higher odds in breeding sows in Kenya (OR = 10.35, p - value = 0.01) ( Wardrop et al. , 2015 ) ; c) borderline significant odds of antigen positivity in female pigs in Tanzania (OR = 1.51, 95%CI = 0.99 - 2.33) ( Braae et al. , 2014 ) , and d) a hi gher prevalence in female pigs compared to male pigs in Nigeria ( Gweba et al. , 2010 ) , although statistical significance was not tested in the latter. Keeping female pigs for longer for breeding purposes as suggested by Khaing et al ., 2015 in Myanmar , and a s shown to significantly increase lingual palpation prevalence in Mexico from 28 to 59% (p - value < 0.001) ( Morales et al. , 2002 ) , could therefore provide a mechanism to explain this. I n terestingly, in one Mexican study, castration of males significantly in creased prevalence from 23 to 50% (p - value < 0.001) ( Morales et al. , 2002 ) . A number of studies, however, have failed to identify an association between the sex of the pigs and the prevalence of antibodies ( Rodriguez - Canul et al. , 1998 , in Mexico ; Garcia e t al. , 1999, 2003 a ; 2003 b , in Peru ), or between sex and active infection ( Sarti et al. , 1992; Morales et al. , a , also in Mexico ) . Exposure heterogeneity to infective material based on age and sex has also been proposed following the observation of soci al dynamics within pig population hierarchy structures ( Copado et al. , 2004 ) . Breed of pig has also been considered as a risk factor in Sub - Saharan Africa, showing that cross - bred pigs are 72% less likely to have been antigen seropositive than local Zambia n dwarf breeds (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.63 - Sikasunge et al. , 2008 c ) , and in Uganda, where cross - bred pigs (OR = 3.221, 95% CI = 1.60 - 6.49) and exotic pigs (OR = 3.11, Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 26 95% CI = 1.73 - 5.58) were at higher antigen - positivity risk compared to local pigs ( K ungu et al. , 2017 a ) . These findings differ from those in Madagascar, which suggested indigenous pigs are 8.5 times more likely (95% CI = 6.7 - 10.7) to be infected compared to exotic improved pigs based on abattoir data ( Porphyre et al. , ca, porcine antibody seropositivity was also associated with the Mexican rustic phenotype (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.01 - 2.11) compared to genetically - improved pigs ( Morales et al. , 2018 ) . Another important feature of pig cysticercosis epidemiology is the obse rvation of spatial clustering reported across a variety of settings. The use of (Ripley's) K functions ( a spatial analysis method used to determine if the phenomenon of interest appears to be clustered or randomly distr ibuted ( porcine cysticercosis incidence for distances between 600 m and 5 km (from a randomly chosen household case) based on antigen data, and between the 0.5 - 6 km and 7.5 - 10 km ranges for lingual palpation incidence data in high - risk areas of Ta nzania . S patial scan statistics found one large significant cluster of porcine cysticercosis prevalence by lingual palpation (p - value = 0.0036, n = 370) in the same study area of Tanzania ( Ngowi et al. , 2010 ) . K - function spatial analysis also identified a cluster of porcine cysticercosis antigen seropositivity in the DRC (p - value < 0.001, n = 24), although the analysis did not find any spatial dependence between clusters of human taeniasis and porcine cysticercosis antibody seropositivity and human tapeworm carriers has also been identified in Peru, as the odds of finding a pig with one cyst significantly increased (OR = 4.6, 95% CI = 1.36 - 15.4) within 50 m of a tapeworm carrier ( Pray et al. , 2017 ) . Furthermore, research from the same area in Northern Peru demonstrated that pigs spend most of their time roaming and interacting with open defecation areas within 100 m of their homes ( Pray et al. , 2016 ) . Spatial dynamics also fluctua te d by location and season in the study area, with home - range size and contact with open defecation Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 27 sites significantly varying between local villages and home ranges identified as significantly larger in the rainy season compare d to the dry season (61%, 9 5% CI = 41 - 73%) ( Pray et al. , 2019 ) . These observations are supported by earlier work in Peru, where Lescano et al . (2007) demonstrated a porcine cysticercosis antibody seroincidence gradient near tapeworm carriers and general positive correlation between porcine cysticercosis seroprevalence and human taenia sis coproantigen (Spearman's coefficient = 0.866, p - value = 0.005). Earlier work in Mexico first identified clustering of lingual palpation cases in the same or adjacent houses ( Sarti - Gu tierrez et al. 2000 ) . However, Morales et al . (2008 a ) found that while all pigs were clustered in households, there was no significant difference between clustering of non - infected and infected (measured by lingual palpation) pigs. Studies in Asia have further highlighted spatial clustering within Cambodian smallholder farming units for antibody seropositive pigs (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.03 - et al. , 201 8 ) . was also demonstrated in Vietnam , with antibody seropositive pigs clustered around a 1,500 m radius in one village, possibly suggesting that roaming ranges are larger for pigs in this village compared to other settings ( Ng - Nguyen et al. , 201 8 a ) . Geographical and production system variation in porcine cysticercosis seroprevalence is also apparent at zone level ( Garcia et al. , 1999 ) and aggregate village level ( Jayashi et al. , 2012 b ) in Peru ; at village level in the DRC ( Praet et al. , 2010 c ) ; between pig production systems in Uganda ( Kungu et al. , 2017 b ) ; by type of pig sector unit in Cambodia ( Adenuga et al. , 2018 ) , and based on land type and use in Kenya , with flooded agricultural land and grassland associated with higher antigen seropositivi ty ( Wardrop et , 2015 ) variation in porcine cysticercosis infection is further recognised in studies, linking to the findings of Pray et al. ( 2019) regarding seasonal roaming differences. For example, Braae et al . (2014) showed seasonal variat ion in antigen seroprevalence, possibly Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 28 linked to seasonally - dependent local crop production practices, whereas Porphyre et al . (2015) reported less infected pig carcasses in dry seasons (e.g. cold dry season in June and August; OR = 0.53, p - value = 0.32 - 0 .88) compared to the rainy season in Madagascar, which supports the finding of higher antigen seroprevalence in the rainy season compared to the dry season in Tanzania (p - value = 0.019) ( Maganira et parasitology, immunology and clinical pathogenesis Humans can act as accidental intermediate hosts, whereby they are exposed to and consume eggs via the faecal - oral transmission route and, therefore, develop human cysticercosis. Exposure to eggs in T. solium endemic areas is assu med to be high, between 10 and 25% of all villages demonstrating anti - T. solium antibody responses ( Tsang and Wilson, 1995; Schantz, 2002; et al . , 2014 ) . H owever, this is likely to be a substantial underestimation of the total population exposed ( Ga rcia et al. , 2001; Meza , 2013 ) . Upon consumption of T. solium eggs and activation (hatching) in the human gut, oncospheres cross the mucosa and migrate to sites in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , eye, striated/heart muscl es and sub - cutaneous tissues of the human host ( Pawlowski, 2002 ) , where cysticerci establish as the vesicular (viable) stage. In the case of porcine cysticercosis, only the morphologically distinct cellulose form of the cysticerci develop . I n human cystice rcosis both the cellulose and racemose types of cysticerci can develop ( Rabiela et al ., 1989 ; Flisser, 2013 ) . While the cellulose type cysticerci are small vesicles as previously described for porcine cysticercosis, the racemose cysticerci, found primarily in certain areas of the CNS, can measure 10 - 20 cm, with the potential to contain up to 60 ml of fluid and appear as a large, round or lobulated bladder which is bounded by a delicate wall ( Flisser, 2013 CNS produc es NCC, the stage almost Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 29 entirely responsible for the human disease burden. Detection in humans is based on cysticercosis antigen and antibody serological tests, which are the same tools as for porcine cysticercosis detection against cysticerci - derived gly coproteins. The cysticercosis serological tests were originally developed for human cysticercosis, and while they can be considered highly specific in humans, reduced specificity in porcine cysticercosis diagnosis is due to the wider spectrum of taeniid sp ecies that pigs are exposed to and infected with ( Lightowlers et al. , 2016 a ) . A combination of imaging and serology is used, where resources permit, for diagnosis of human NCC in clinical settings ( Garcia et al. , 2012; host immunological response to CNS - located cysticerci results in a process of degeneration from a colloidal stage to a non - viable granular stage, and finally transformation to a mineralized nodule known as the ) . Cysti cerci may also remain viable for decades in humans. When the colloidal stage is reached, a mononuclear inflammatory reaction results in damage to surrounding brain parenchyma, oedema, gliosis, fibrosis, necrosis 2000; Carpio, 2002 ) In the final granular and calcified stages, local oedema subsides but the subsequent formation of multinucleated giant cells (brain granulomas) and gliosis may persist ( White, 2000 ) . Several factors determine the clinical manifesta tions of symptomatic human NCC, depending on location and number of cysts. Degeneration of cysticerci located in the parenchymal area of the brain (intraparenchymal NCC) manifests clinically as seizures, while location of cysticerci in the subarachnoid spa ce, basal cisterns and within (extra - parenchymal NCC) different clinical cour se, with the racemose cysticercal morphology being more common ( Garcia 2014 ) . Extra - parenchymal NCC is a progressive disease, associated with clinical m orbidity due to hydrocephalus from blockage of the cerebrospinal fluid circulation following racemose cysticerci growth Garcia associated . As previously discussed, NCC also occurs in pigs, with the predominance of parenchyma - located vesicular cysticerci in porcine NCC, 2008 ) . The pleiomorphic nature of disease in human NCC has also been hypothesised to be a result of genetic factors influencing susceptibility and individual - level pathogenesis, given the diverse clinical manifesta tions occurring in infected individuals of the same age, sex and from similar study populations ( Fleury . For example, genetic polymorphisms related to the expression of the matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) - 9 enzyme, wh ich alters permeability of the blood - brain barrier and influx of immune cells to stimulate NCC cysticerci degeneration ( Gupta et al. , 2012 ) , and variations in susceptibility due to the toll - like receptor (TLR) - 4 g ene, are possible candidates underpin ning g enetic variation between human hosts in NCC clinical manifestations ( Verma et al. , 2010 ) . 2.7. Human epidemiology and risk factors Human cysticercosis seroprevalence ranges from: a) 1.6 % to 45.3% based on antibody detection ( Diaz et al. , 1992; S arti et Ljungstr\u00f6m, 1998; Garcia et al. , 1998, 1999 , 2003 ; Gomes et al. , 2015 ) ; b) 0.4 % to 16.7% based antigen seroprevalence ( Nguekam et al. Praet ) , and c) 0.7 % to 11.9% based on combined antigen/antibody or adjusted seroprevalence ( Secka et al. , - Almeida et al. , 2014 ) . A systematic review Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 31 conducted by Coral - Almeida et al . (2015) has previously analysed risk fact ors for human cysticercosis seropositivity globally. Reported associations between risk factors and human cysticercosis seropositivity , based on the review by Coral - Almeida et al ., 2015 , are included in the following section , with this paper providing an u pdat ed literature review to the end of 2019 ( Table 3 ). Sanitation practices, including latrine availability and usage, have been clearly documented as risk factors. Latrine availability and usage were positively and statistically significantly associated w ith antigen seropositivity in Senegal (p - value < 0.001) ( Secka et al. , 2011 ) ; antibody seropositivity in Honduras (OR = 2.92, 95% CI = 1.35 - 6.05) ( S\u00e1nchez et al . , 1998 ) ; with defecating outdoors in Vietnam (OR = 11.1, 95% CI = 2.97 - 42.0) ( Ng - Nguyen et al. , 2018 c ) , and in Chinese schoolchildren coming from households lacking a toilet (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.38 - 2.46) ( Openshaw et al. , 2018 ) . Antigen seropositivity was also positively and significantly associated with the use of well - derived water in Kenya (OR = 2.76, p - value = 0.02) ( Wardrop et al. , 2015 ) , and with washing hands by 'dipping method' in Tanzania (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 2.5 - 5.9) ( Mwanjali et al. , 2013 ) . Antibody seropositivity was significantly associated with lack of potable water in Honduras (OR = 3 .66, 95% CI = 1.25 - 9.94) ( S\u00e1nchez et al . , 1998 ) ; presence of a sewage installation in the household in Peru (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.3 - 4.68) ( Montano et al. , 2005 ) , and 'poor' personal (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.87 - 6.4) and household hygiene (OR = 2.64, 95% CI = 1.28 - 5.44) et al . 1992 ) . Owning and raising pigs are significantly associated with seropositivity. In Burkina Faso, the percentage of households owning pigs (at village level) was associated with higher 18 - month antigen seroconversion rat e (cumulative incidence ratio (CIR) = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01 - 1.05) ( Dermauw et al. , 2018 b ) ; antibody seropositivity was associated with pig ownership in Honduras (OR = 5.39, 95% CI = 1.42 - 19.50) ( S\u00e1nchez Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 32 owning infected pigs in Peru (O R = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.06 - 1.66) ( Garc i a et al. , 2003 b ) . In India, there was a significant association between those living in pig - rearing areas and antigen s eropositivity (p - value = 0.006), but not antibody seropositivity ( Jayaraman et al. , 2011 ) . In Chinese schoolchildren, antibody seropositivity was associated with pig - owning households (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.08 - 3.03); those households allowing pigs to roam freely (OR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.72 - 2.98), and those reporting feeding human faeces to pigs (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.03 - 2.16) ( Openshaw et al. , 2018 ) . Across a range of settings, pork consumption and related factors have also been significantly associated with risk of human cysticercosis. For example, antigen seropositivity was significantly associated with e ating pork or a history of eating pork (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.27 - 3.57) ( Carabin et al. , 2015 ) , and with a higher individual - level 18 - month antigen seroconversion rate (CIR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.28 - 5.89) in Burkina Faso ( 2018 b ) . Antibody seropo sitivity was also significantly associated with consumption of undercooked pork in Venezuela (OR = 18, 95% CI = , and frequent consumption of pork in Mexico (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.18 - 2.37) ( Sarti et al. , 1992 ) . In addition, the location where pork is eaten has been demonstrated as a risk factor . I n Burkina Faso, antigen seropositivity was significantly associated with eating pork at home (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.42 - 5.31) as well as eating pork at the village market (OR = 4.10, 95% CI = 2.07 - 8.11) compared to never eating pork ( Carabin et al. , 2015 ) , and also significantly associated with the individual - level 18 - month antigen seroconversion rate for eating pork at home (CIR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.11 - 5.63), at the local village market (CIR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.56 - 8.84) or any village market (CIR = 4.5, 95% CI = 1.48 - 13.71) ( Dermauw et al. , 2018 b ) . In addition, antibody seropositivity was significantly associated with eating pork at home in Cameroon (p - value < 0.001) ( Nkouawa et al. , 2017 ) . A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 33 raw vegetables regularly in Vietnam ( Ng - Nguyen et al. , 2018 c ) has also been significantly associated with antibody seropositivity (OR = 9.98, 95% CI = 2.89 - 34.4).

Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 36 Further socio - economic factors are also implicated, including being in a higher wealth quintile at the individual level significantly and negatively associated with antigen seropositvity in Burkina Faso (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = ., 2015 ) , social marginalization being associated with an increased antibody ser oprevalence in Mexico (p - value = 0.01) ( Morales et al. , 2018 ) , and low education levels being associated with increased antibody seropositivity in Honduras (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.33 - 4.69) ( S\u00e1nchez, Medina and Ljungstr\u00f6m, 1998 ) and Peru (OR = 2.69, 95% CI = 1.09 - 6.65) ( Moro et al. , 2003 ) . In addition, antigen seropositivity was significantly and positively associated with lack of knowledge of the transmission cycle in Burkina Faso (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.86 - 4.90) ( Carabin et al. , 2015 ) , and antibody seropositi vity with lack of knowledge in Honduras (OR = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.26 - 4.49) ( S\u00e1nchez et al ., 1998 ) . Individuals with a history of or having current T. solium taeniasis have been widely reported to be at an increased risk, highlighting the role of auto - infecti on. T aenia solium taeniasis positivity by copro - Ag - ELISA was statistically significantly and positively associated with human cysticercosis antigen seropositivity (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.3 - 5.2) and antibody seropositivity (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.3 - 5.2) in Tanz ania ( Mwanjali et al. , 2013 ) ; antigen seropositivity in Zambia (OR = 2.9, p - value = 0.029) ; antibody seropositivity with passing proglottids in Mexico (OR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.2 - 4.4) ( Sarti et al. , 1992 ) , and with human taeniasis carrier households measured by copro - Ag - ELISA (OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.43 - 3.42) in Guatemala ( Garcia - Noval et al. , 1996 ) and Brazil (p - value = 0.017) ( Gomes et al. , 2002 ) . school - children with taeniasis (by stool microscopy) were statistically significantly more likely to hav e cysticercosis antibody seropositivity (chi - squared = 69.293, p - value < 0.001), while at the school level, those with higher taeniasis prevalence were associated with significantly higher cysticercosis seroprevalence (Spearman's rank correlation coefficie nt = 0.925, p - value < 0.05) ( Li et al. , 2019 ) . Another study of T. solium Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 37 infection in Chinese school - children also found an association of cysticercosis antibody seropositivity with \"self - reporting of worms in faeces\" (OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.18 - 2.91) throu gh a mixed - effect logistic regression model controlling for school - level clustering ( Openshaw et al. , 2018 ) . Outcome measurement through self - reporting, however, is open to substantial limitations including recall bias, alongside the inability to identify the tapeworm species. Increasing age is strongly associated with human cysticercosis exposure and infection. In Senegal, older age groups were statistically significantly associated with combined antigen and antibody seropositivity (p - value = 0.001) ( Secka et al. , 2011 ) ; with antigen seropositivity in Tanzania (higher in 35 - 45 year olds (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.20 - 5.00) and in 46 - 60 year olds (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.30 - 5.30) than in those aged 15 - 25 years) ( Mwanjali et al. , 2013 ) , and with being over 30 years of age in Zambia (p - value = 0.001) ( Mwape et al. , 2012 ) . In Cameroon, age had a significant effect on the odds of infection (OR = 1.05, p - value < 0.001) ( Nguekam et al. , 2003 ) , and this increase was also documented in two of three provinces in Burkina Faso ( OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 2015 ) In Meso and South America, significantly increased antibody seropositivity with age was observed in Mexico (p = 0.05 for those aged 46 - 55 years compared to those in the 4 - 9 - year age group) ( Sarti et al . , 1992 ) . I n Peru , seropositivity in those aged 6 - 15 years was significantly lower compared to older age groups (p - value < 0.05) ( Diaz et al. , 1992 ) , and to pork vendors over the age of 30 years (p - value = 0.001), also in Peru ( Garcia et al. , 1998 ) . A chan ge point analysis (which identifies abrupt changes in positivity frequencies as a function of age) and logistic regression in Ecuador ( Praet et al. , 2010 a ) , identified that the proportion of antibody - seropositive increased significantly up to 40 years of a ge (p - value < 0.001) before plateauing, in contrast to antigen seropositivity, which remained at a constant level until 60 years of age before significantly increasing thereafter (p - value < 0.001). By contrast, Moro et al . (2003) Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 38 identified that antibody s eropositivity was significantly higher in younger age groups (below 30 years; OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.39 - 4.60) in Peru. Being of the male sex has been statistically significantly associated with increased odds of exposure as measured by antibody seropositiv ity in Tanzania (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1 - 2.1) ( Mwanjali et al. , 2013 ) , with prevalence of active infection by antigen seropositivity in the DRC (26.4%, 95% CI = 21.8 - 31.1% in males compared to 17.5%, 95% CI = 13.8 - 21.2% in females) ( Kanobana et al. , 2011 ) , and with antigen seropositivity in Burkina Faso (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.74 - 3.69) ( Carabin et al. , 2015 ) . However, being male was protective for antigen seropositivity in Kenya (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.37 - 0.91) ( Wardrop et al. , 2015 ) . In Meso and South America , females had a significantly higher antibody seroprevalence across two Guatemalan villages (OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.3 - 2.5) ( Garcia - Noval et al. , 1996 ) , and antibody seroprevalence was significantly and positively associated with being a female pork vendor ( p - value = 0.001), but being male was positively and significantly associated with antibody seroprevalence in the general population in Peru (p - value = 0.04) ( Garcia et al. , 1998 ) . Spatial clustering of human cysticercosis cases is a feature of transmissio n, particularly in Meso and South America. In Mexico, household clustering of antibody seropositive cases was evident (chi - squared test = 22.1, degrees of freedom = 6, p - value < 0.005, indicating that the rate of seropositivity varies significantly by ehold) ( Sarti et al. , 1992 ) . n Peru, Garcia et al . (2003 b ) identified that cluster - level effects explained most of variance per case (p - value < 0.001) , and also showed that household contacts of taeniasis carriers had a 3.4 times increased odds of being s eropositive (p - value < 0.001) . Lescano et al . (2009) , also in Peru, further reported the operation of a statistically significant gradient of antibody seroprevalence with distance from a microscopy - positive taeniasis household as follows : being located at 1 - 50 m from a carrier household was associated with 64% Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 39 seroprevalence; 2 - 50 m with 32%, and > 50 m with 21%; prevalence ratio (PR) (PR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.25 - 3.14 for < 50 m and PR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.01 - 2.29 for > 50 m). In India, and using the spatial sca n statistic software SaTScan TM , significant clusters of human cysticercosis antigen seropositivity (i.e. most significant; RR = 14.2, p - value = 0.002) and of antibody seropositivity (i.e. most significant; RR = 4.28, p - value = 0.007) were identified ( Ragha va et al. , 2010 ) . In Vietnam, a ntibody - positive household clusters were found to cluster, using K functions, within distances of 200 - 300 m ( Ng - Nguyen et al. , 2018 a ) , although the authors noted that it was not possible to test whether a spatial dependence e xisted between human taeniasis and cysticercosis cases due to the low numbers of taeniasis cases in the study area. One study in Africa also documented multiple clusters of human cysticercosis antigen seropositivity in Zambia, with one larger cluster relat ed to an identified taeniasis cluster ( Mwape et al. , 2012 ) . Therefore, in certain settings, there is a clear spatial relationship between human cysticercosis and taeniasis cases. Geographical heterogeneity in human cysticercosis seroprevalence also clearl y exists as demonstrated for antigen seropositivity (p - value < 0.001) between communities in Cameroon ( Nguekam et al. , 2003 ) , and analysis for one province (Boulkiemd\u00e9; OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.53 - 3.88) compared to the reference province in Burkina Faso ( Carabin et al. , 2015 ) . A ntibody seroprevalence was also significantly different between two communities in Guatemala (OR = 1.85, 95% CI= 1.3 - 2.5) ( Garcia - Noval et al. , 1996 ) , between regions in Morelos state in Mexico (p - value = 0.01) ( Moral es et al. , 2018 ) , and between rural and urban populations for both antigen and antibody seroprevalence in India (p - value < 0.006) ( Jayaraman et al. , 2011 ) . Other environmental factors of interest include the association of land - use type, including the prop ortion of either flooded agricultural land (OR = 1.09, p - value= 0.03) or grassland (OR = 0.998, p - value = 0.03) within a 1 km buffer, and precipitation (OR = 0.998, Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 40 p - value = 0.02) with antigen seropositivity in Kenya ( Wardrop et al. , 2015 ) . In Burkina Fas o, and at village level, the percentage of sand in the soil (CIR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.0 - 1.04) was significantly associated with antigen seroconversion rates over 18 months, but not the pH level, or the percentage of silt or clay in the soil ( Dermauw et al. , 2018 b ) . 3. MORBIDITY AND ECONOMIC IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH TAENIA SOLIUM The burden of human disease associated with T. solium infection results from the development of cysts in the CNS including brain tissue, leading to NCC as previously described. Epileptic seizures have been identified as the most commonly reported presenting symptom of NCC ( Winkler and Richter, 2015 ; Singh et al ., 2020 ) , but a range of other neurological and psychiatric symptoms have been identified ( White, 2000; Widdowson et al. , 2000; Mur ray et al. , 2012 ) . Furthermore, t here is a broader psychological and social burden associated with chronic epilepsy in affected communit ies, with increased stigmatization experienced by those with epilepsy, especially in rural, marginalised settings and th ose communities where traditional belief systems predominate ( Baskind and Birkbek , 2005 ; Winkler et 2010 ; O'Neill et al . 2019 ) . In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG) ( WHO, 2015 ) esti mated the global burden of disease by assuming that 29% of the burden of epilepsy would be attributable to NCC in T. solium - endemic populations, as identified in a meta - analysis by Ndimubanzi et al. (2010) to total populations estimated to be at risk. Esti mation of Disability - Adjusted Life Years (DALYs ) due to NCC - associated epilepsy, therefore, used prevalence - based estimates of Years Lived with Disability (YLD s ) as an approximation for incidence - based YLD s , as data did not Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 41 suggest presence of a strong tem poral trend in incidence ( Torgerson et al. , 2015 ) . The analysis calculated that NCC - associated epilepsy was responsible for a median of 2,788,426 (95% uncertainty interval ( UI . Gripper and (2017) more recently conducted a systematic review to quantify the relationship between epilepsy and NCC through a meta - analysis of case - control studies, showing that an individual with NCC has a 2.76 times increased risk (common odds) of devel oping epilepsy (95% CI = 2.19 - 3.48) compared to an uninfected individual. In addition, Gripper and Welburn (2017) also estimated a common proportion of 31.54% of epilepsy cases (95% CI = 26.86 % - 36.41%) associa ted with NCC, suggesting that earlier attributa ble proportions of epilepsy to NCC were reasonable. The study also suggested that geographical heterogeneity may exist in the proportion of epilepsy cases attributable to NCC between continents, although the authors noted that there is a wide degree of het erogeneity in the studies that were incorporated in the meta - analysis. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 S tudy estimated the nd HALE Collaborators, Study 1,370,000 (95% UI 874,000 - of NCC with epilepsy ( GBD 2019 Cause and Risk Summaries, 2020 ) . The WHO FERG calculation for cysticercosis YLDs, as previously p erformed for the Global Burden of Disease Study iterations, is likely still to be an underestimation of the total burden given that, due to the paucity of data, the estimate is yet to include the role of other neurological sequelae ( Hotez et al. , 2014 ) . Ot her zoonotic and vector - borne parasites are also considered important risk factors for epilepsy ( Ngugi et al ., 2013 ; Singh et al ., 20 20 ). For example, o nchocerciasis, caused by the filarial nematode associated with epilepsy , cu rrently in sub - Saharan Africa (but see also Jilek - Aal l , 2004 ) , with Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 42 the observation of increasing epilepsy prevalence in proximity to r ivers where the blackfly vector breeds et al ., 2020 ) . Understanding the geographic al distribution and overlap between epil epsy cau sed by different infectious agents, especially in sub - Sah aran African settings ( Katabarwa et al ., 2008 ) , is therefore an important research gap. There may also be some burden associated with tae niasis in humans, particularly in childhood, as infection with T. solium can be associated with blood loss and anaemia in a small number of cases ( Yoshino, ) . H owever, it is considered that infection with the adult tapeworm is, by and large, asymptomatic ( Garcia et al . , 2014 ) . The cross - sectoral nature of the Taenia solium disease system means that there are economic costs associated with both human NCC - related morbidity, and the impact of cysticercosis infect ion in the pig population. A WHO landscaping review on this subject area ( Winkler and Richter, 2015 ) identified a number of studies demonstrating the significant cost to patients with NCC - associated morbidity. In Peru , the total costs from a patient perspe ctive were USD 996 per person over a period of two years ( Rajkotia et al. , 2007 ) , while Bhattarai et al . (2012) identified the total annual costs to patients in two Mexican referral hospitals as 212% of the annual minimum wage salary if the individual had received prior medical attention. In India, the costs accrued in the period between presentation of new onset seizures to resolution of the NCC lesion were on average 50.9% of the per capita Gross D omestic P roduct ( Murthy and Rajshekar, 2007 ) . A stud y in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa estimated the monetary burden per capita to be between USD 2.6 - 4.8 in the context of the annual health expenditure set at USD 41.3 per capita in the region, relating to an overall monetary burden of USD 18.6 - 3 4.2 million in an area with an estimated 34,662 people living with NCC - associated epilepsy ( Carabin et al. , 2006 ) . Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 43 Several studies have attempted to evaluate the cross - sectoral economic burden, also termed the 'total societal burden' by considering both t he human NCC morbidity cost and the economic losses to pig production in T. solium - endemic regions. In Western Cameroon, 95.3% of the burden was attributed to human NCC direct and indirect costs, while 4.7% was attributed to pig production losses ( Praet et al. , 2009 ) . Parameters used to calculate pig production losses were the average value of an adult pig and a set reduction of 30% in value after diagnosis with cysticercosis, applying these to Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO, 2007 ) estimates for pig population numbers and the porcine cysticercosis prevalence defined by tongue inspection ( Pouedet , 2003 ) . A similar approach to costing, applied to the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa study, found that pig production losses contributed to 20% of the total economic burden ( Carabin et . (2017 b ) estimated that pig production losses accounted for closer to a third of the total societal economic burden in Tanzania. The authors suggested that the gr eater contribution of pig production losses in Tanzania compared to both the Eastern Cape Province and Cameroon studies resulted from the significantly higher pig population numbers, higher tongue - based porcine cysticercosis prevalence and the higher assum ed price reduction of infected pigs (50% in Tanzania study compared to 30% in Cameroon ) . It is clear that parameter assumptions can markedly vary the estimates associated with the human health and pig production sectors. Authors across the studies suggest that limitations exist in the availability of context - specific estimates, especially for NCC - associated burden of disease parameters to assess accurately the true burden and cost ( Carabin et al. , al ., 2018 ) . Broader, regional estimates such as those calculated for sub - Saharan Africa or expert opinion are often used in place of specific estimates. Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 44 Data limitations are also likely to exist for pig - product ion loss parameters . F or example, estimation of porcine cysticercosis prevalence across the entire at - risk population using prevalence data measured by tongue inspection will likely be a significant underestimation , as this diagnostic has low sensitivity f or light infections ( Dorny et al. , 2004; Phiri et al. , 2006 ) . It is, therefore, critical that economic burden calculations are appropriately parameterised for specific settings. For Meso and South America, recent estimates have been calculated that conside r the broader societal economic burden. Bhattarai et al . (2019) estimated that the burden in Mexico was USD 215.7 million (95% BCI = USD 109.3 - 361.9 million) due to NCC clinical morbidity, and USD 19.5 million (95% BCI = USD 5.7 - 35.9 million) due to porcine cysticercosis. Torgerson et al . (2018) has recently proposed a zoonotic , z DALY metric, which incorporates an additional component to the traditional DALY estimate - the animal loss equivalents (ALEs), through estimation of the local per capita income and monetary value of livestock losses (divided by the gross national per capita income). This methodology has been applied to T. solium in Cameroon by assuming a 30% reduction in price of infected pigs, calculating that only 1% on the total societal burden w as associated with ALEs (the remaining 99% attributed to DALYs) in Cameroon, compared to 90% attributed to ALEs for brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan, a nd 31% attributed to ALEs for Q fever in the Netherlands ( Torgerson et al. , 2018 ) . The cross - sectoral burden, im pacting human health and agricultural sectors, implicates T. solium as a One Health problem, defined as a \"collaborative effort of multiple disciplines \u2014 working locally, nationally, and globally \u2014 to attain optimal health for people, animals and our environme nt\" ( American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) , 2008 ) . Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 45 4. INTERVENTIONS TO CONTROL AND ELIMINATE TAENIA SOLIUM Extensive reviews have been conducted to assess the impact of interventions over the last 5 years, including a critical appraisal of interven tion study designs by Carabin and Traor\u00e9 (2014) , a WHO landscaping review in 2015 ( Thomas, 2015 ) , and the most recent systematic review of interventions between the period 1st January 2014 till 1st May 2017 undertaken by de Coster et al . (2018) . The follow ing analysis leans heavily on the WHO landscaping review of Thomas ( 2015 ) and Carabin and Traor\u00e9 (2014) , but has been conducted independently of the de Coster et al . (2018) review , and includes cross - checking of studies for the sake of completeness. Fig. 3 hig h lights the available intervention tools for the control of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis, indicates the components of the life - cycle which contribute to the main health burden and economic impact of the disease , and illustrates the intersection be tween human health, veterinary health and the environment to emphasize the need for a One Health approach to curb taeniasis/cysticercosis.

T aenia solium diagnostics The ability to monitor the impact of interventions on transmission using di agnostic tools is central to research and programmatic efforts for the neglected (and other) infectious diseases ( Ghani et al. , 2015 ) . Given the multi - host system characteristic of T. solium , several diagnostics are available for the different life - cycle s tages (an overview is provided in Table 4 ). Matthew A. Dixon et al .

Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 48 Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 49 4.2. Chemotherapy in humans Di rectly treating human tapeworm carriers influences transmission by eliminating the source of infection for pigs and humans. The two main approaches for implementing treatment programmes focus on mass drug administration (MDA) or more targeted treatment of tapeworm carriers by using discriminatory diagnostics to identify these individuals followed by treatment ( Table 5 ). At present, the main anthelmintics used in these programmes are either praziquantel (PZQ) or niclosamide (NCZ), with the efficacy of 5mg/kg PZQ estimated to range between 67% and 94% cure rates ( Pawlowski, 1990, 1991 ) . A recent meta - analysis by Haby et al . (2020a) has indicated cure rates of (95%CI = 100%) 77.9% - ., 2012; Carabin and Traor\u00e9, 2014 ). However, Clinton White et al. (2020) have raised concerns about the analyses presented by Haby et al . (2020 a ) , on the grounds that between - study differences in the methods used to assess efficacy were not t aken into account. Concerns were also raised regarding the safety analyses, as only a handful of the included studies had implemented carefully designed surveillance protocols aimed to detect epileptic seizures and other neurological side - effects that have been noted after mass PZQ or albendazole (ABZ) therapy, due to the killing of viable brain cysts ( Clinton White et al ., 2020 ). PZQ has the limitation of possible adverse neurological outcomes in those individuals with NCC and it can cross the blood - brain barrier , leading to rupture of cysts , especially at higher doses ( Pawlowski, 2006 ) . Results from a prospective study on neurologic al side - effects after praziquantel MDA ( for schistosomiasis ) identified neurologic 4.2.1 M ass D rug A dministration in humans alone A number of earlier studies have been conducted primarily in Meso and South American settings ( Cruz et 2000 ) , and there is one review of a Chinese MDA programme ( Pawlowski et al . , 2005 ) . Some of these studies suffer from substantial study design limitations, such as the use of unreliable outcome measures (e.g. self - re ported parasite expulsion ) , or very limited information provided to assess the quality of the studies. More detailed studies have identified a short - term significant reduction in prevalence, given the short follow - up period , of h uman taeniasis (measured by copro - Ag - ELISA) and porcine cysticercosis antibody seroprevalence after one round of human MDA with PZQ in Mexico at six months post - treatment ( Sarti et al. , 2000 ) , and after one round of human MDA with NCZ in Guatemala ( Allan e t al. , 1997 ) . In Lao PDR, two MDA rounds using ABZ , also to target other soil - transmitted helminthiases, demonstrated a 100% reduction in human taeniasis carriers (by microscopy and molecular detection) at the end of the study ( Ash et al. , 2017 ) . However, a case report of NCC following self - medication with a single 400 mg dose of ABZ has been documented in Peru ( Garcia et al ., 2007 ). As described above, t he quality of available data to assess efficacy and safety of ABZ and PZQ for taeniasis MDA has been que stioned ( Clinton White et al ., 2020 ) (but also see Haby et al ., 2020b ). Table 5 summarises the results of intervention studies using treatment of human taeniasis carriers. 4.2.2 Mass Drug Administration in humans combined with health education Reductions i n the prevalence of human taeniasis (diagnosed by the Kato - Katz method) and porcine cysticercosis (by meat inspection) were identified following a human - focussed intervention in Ecuador with one MDA round with PZQ and health education (HE) after one Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 51 year ( Cruz et al. , 1989 ) , as well as in China, using biannual PZQ treatment ( Pawlowski et al ., 2005 ) . As stated in the previous section, substantial limitations apply to these studies, including the lack of comparison groups; in most cases the comparator wa s the baseline prevalence value ( Table 5 ). The sections above also discussed the potential risks and concerns posed by MDA for human taeniasis.

Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 55 4.2.3 Treatment of school - age children or selected treatment of taeniasis carriers/those at risk A multifaceted contr ol program me, including treatment with albendazole (ABZ) to school - age children in Honduran schools (in addition to HE and training of pig farmers ) , resulted in a non - significant reduction of taeniasis prevalence (measured by Kato - Katz) over a four - year period, but a significant reduction in NCC as an aetiology of epilepsy over a six - year period ( Medina et al. , 2011 ) ( Table 5 ) . A targeted approach , involving identifying taeniasis carriers within a 100 - meter ring around a tongue - positive pig (ring - screening/treatment intervention) was implemented in Peru ( O'Neal et al. , 2014 ) ( Table 5 ) . O'Neal et al. (2014) suggest that the increased participation in a ring - targeted approach (approximately 90%) relative to mass screening/treatment at completion (less than 75%) highligh t s the potential benefit of this type of approach on community adherence and effective coverage. The ring - screening approach has been tested on a larger scale with parallel study arms including a targeted strategy and MDA, across approximately 10,000 indiv iduals and 6,000 pigs over a longer follow up in Peru ( O'Neal et al . , 2017 ) . In Tan zania, a age treatment programme ( with 40mg/kg PZQ for schistosomiasis) was augmented with an additional taeniasis test and treat (track - and - treat) strategy and demonstrate d a significant decrease in taeniasis prevalence ( Braae 2017b ) suggest that while the Tanzanian study shows promise for integration of T. solium control within a schistosomiasis control programme, a major barrie r might be the risk of possible adverse neurological symptoms in those with NCC ( Flisser solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 56 4.3. Health education Health education and promotion approaches have been viewed as an effective approach in modifying pig - rearing practices ( Sarti et al. , 1997; Wohlgemut et al. , 2010 ) and increasing self - reporting by tapeworm carriers. Health ed ucation can also help to decrease food preparation practice - associated risk of infection, including consumption of undercooked pork meat through ineffective co oking methods ( Djurkovic - Djakovic et al. , 2013 ) , or consumption of raw pork ( - Vergara et al. , et al. , 2013 ) . The most robust evidence for the impact of health education, based on studies with a rigorous study design (i.e., ran domisation and control groups), has been demonstrated across settings in Sub - Saharan Africa ( Table 6 ). In Tanzania, an approach using Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines to plan the intervention in smallholder pig farmers demons trated a reduction (statistical significance not tested) in porcine cysticercosis antigen seroincidence in the intervention group post - intervention, although knowledge improved in both control and intervention villages ( Ngowi et al. , 2009 ) . A cluster rand omised control trial (RCT) testing a health education intervention in Tanzanian school - children, demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge and attitudes at 6 months compared to baseline; however, an increase of knowledge/attitudes scores in both co ntrol and intervention groups suggest ed that possible contamination occurred between groups ( Mwidunda et al. , 2015 ) . Another cluster RCT , testing a community - based health education intervention in Burkina Faso , demonstrated a cumulative decrease in human c ysticercosis antigen incidence and a reduced risk (adjusted CIR ) in those exposed to the health education programme, although there w ere no significant reductions of associated risks ( Carabin et al. , 2018 ) . Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 57 A computer - based health education tool, 'The Vici ous Worm' ( Vang Johansen et al. ) , has been evaluated in multiple contexts, demonstrating short - and long - term significant improvements in knowledge and attitudes in health and agricultural professionals in Tanzania ( Ertel et al. , 2017 ; Lauridsen et a l. , 2019 ) and in primary - school children in Zambia ( Hobbs et al. , 2018 b , 2019 ) , although impact on transmission has not yet been determined . I n the context of Zambia, use of 'The Vicious Worm' forms part of a wider prospective, large - scale community - based T. solium CYSTISTOP intervention study ( Hobbs et al. , 2018 a , 2019 ) , which may make it difficult to disentangle the impact of the health education component from that of the other intervention components.

Improved pig husbandry Improved pig husbandry interventions mainly focus on the us e of confinement strategies, e.g. u se of corrals. In terms of transmission, this prevents pig exposure to T. solium infective material in the environment, especially when foraging in areas of a community where individuals defecate openly. However, in cysticercosis - endemic communities, enabl ing pigs to roam freely provides an investment - free approach to pig rearing ( Gilman et al. , 2012 ) . Transitioning to larger - scale farming systems with high biosecurity in endemic settings requires regional and national economic development ( Lightowlers, 199 9 ) and is unlikely to be a shorter - term viable option for endemic countries. The multifaceted control programme in Honduras discussed in the human chemotherapy section ( Medina et al. , 2011 ) , contained a training component aimed at pig farmers towards chang ing husbandry practices; however, it was impossible to disentangle the impact of this component within the entire programme. Braae et al . (2014) determined, through a longitudinal analysis, that pigs raised under semi - confined conditions had significantly reduced odds of porcine cysticercosis antigen seropositivity. However, the non - interventional design of th e study by Braae et al . (2014) makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions (Table 7). Table 7.

Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 61 4.5. Impro ved sanitation Preventing environmental c ontamination with infected material through construction and utilisation of latrines, is another point in the transmission cycle that can be targeted. Improved personal and household hygiene (e.g. washing hands after defecation ) can help reduce exposure of humans to T. solium eggs and development of human cysticercosis ( Mwape et al. , 2012 ) . I mprovement s in household and community sanitation infrastructur e alongside personal hygiene hav e numerous positive externalities associated with risk reduction for other soil - transmitted helminth iases and diarrh of the env ironment in T. solium transmission further re - enforces th e need for a One Health approach ( AVMA, 2008; Braae et al. , 2019 solium contro l and elimination sustainably . The study by Bulaya et al. (2015) in Zambia, focussed on a Community - Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) - based intervention , report ed on an i nterim analysis based on a subset of intervention villages ( Table 8 ). This analysis recorded an increase in porcine cysticercosis Ag seroprevalence in intervention villages at the 8 - month follow - up compared to baseline , but firm conclusions cannot be drawn as final analysis is not available . 4.6. Improved meat inspection Implementing improved hygienic conditions for slaughtering of animals in endemic settings and enforcing meat inspection are additional intervention tool s to reduce the number of T. solium cysts entering the food chain via infected meat. Routine detection is often conducted at the point of sale in rural villages or in slaughter houses, using either tongue or pig carcass inspection, which both have poor sensitivity ( Dorny et al. , 2004 ) . T here are no studies comparing the relative impact on transmission of differing inspections methods, or improved meat inspe ction techniques pigs is based on agents ( Mkupasi et al ., 2013 ) , which act to reduce rapidly the infectious reservoir pool in pigs thereby preventing human exposure to infected meat. This approach is generally implemented as mass treatment of animals, known as metaphylaxis in food animals ( Baptiste and ( Gonzalez et for porcine cysticercosis treatment; however, oxfendazole (OFZ) is used as the treatment option of choice. OFZ, a safe and inexpensive benzimidazole, has been established in laboratory experiment al studies as a highly efficacious anthelmintic at rapidly reducing the viability and presence of cysts ( Gonzalez et al ., 1996, 1998 ). OFZ is more effective in eliminat ing active cysts compared to other antehelmintics such as triclabendazole (TCBZ) ( - C ( Table 9 ). Sikasunge et al .

Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 63 (2008 b ) showed that treated meat takes 10 - 26 weeks to re - gain 'normal' appearance after infection and that a minimum 21 - day withholding period is required before human consumption ( Moreno et al. , 2012 ). A randomized control field study with matched non - treated controls in Mozambique ( Pondja et al ., 2012 ) also demonstrated that non - viable cysts were seen in the muscles of p igs in the treated group, with a statistically significant reduction in the odds and incidence of porcine cysticercosis by antigen detection in intervention pigs after treatment at 4 and 9 months. The potential use of OFZ for human cysticercosis is also be ing explored, and the first in - humans study examining the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of OFZ has been recently published ( An et al ., 2019 ). 4.8. Porcine cysticercosis vaccination Prophylactic vaccines to protect pigs from cysticercosis have receiv ed major attention as potential control and elimination intervention tools ( Lightowlers et al. , 2000; Sciutto et al. , 2008 ) . The TSOL18 recombinant - antigen vaccine is the leading option, providing a high level of protection against T. solium exposure in va ccinated animals ( Gonzalez et al. 2005; Jayashi et , 2012 a ) , and has been licenced ( GALVmed, 2017 . Two the TSOL45 and a tripeptide vaccine (S3Pvac) - confer high leve ls of protection in laboratory animals ( Martinez - Oc a \u00f1a et al. , 2011 ) .

Advances in Parasitology 65 4.8.1 TSOL18 vaccine The TSOL18 vaccine has demonstrated clear efficacy in laboratory settings ( Gonzalez et al. , 2005; Silva et al. , 2010 ) . In field settings, TSOL18 has also demonstrated substantial effectiveness. A small - scale study in C ameroon reported a cysticercal prevalence of 0% (0/97 ; 95%CI = 0% ; 95%CI = 12.9% - 28.6% ) in control pigs (by necropsy at 12 - 13 months of age ) .

However, the study by Jayashi et al. (2012 a ) , in Peru , found a statistically significant 99.7% reduction in the number of viable cysticerci in animals vaccinated with 2 doses of TSOL16 - TSOL18, indicating that further research is needed to elucidate a potential cysticidal effe ct . Lightowlers et al . (2016b) investigated the effect of changing the duration between the first and second TSOL18 doses from 4 to 20 weeks . The authors report ed that piglets which received the second immunisation 12 weeks after the first one had a 3.1 times gr eater antibody response than those with a gap between the first and second dose of four weeks (p - value of borderline signif icance = 0.046) . T here was no decrease in antibody responses in animals receiving their second injection after 20 weeks, the longest interval investigated . Lightowlers et al . (2016b) suggested that this could provide greater flexibility for control program mes as a second vaccine dose could be implemented several months later. Currently, quest ions around implementation include the need for a cold chain and the feasibility of achieving high coverage where a multiple - dose vaccination schedule is required.

S3Pvac vaccine Vaccination with S3Pvac vaccine (a Taenia crassiceps - based synthetic pepti de vaccine) against T. solium porcine cysticercosis, found that cysticerci were susceptible to the immune responses induced by the vaccine ( de Aluja et al ., 1999 ). This vaccine has demonstrated efficacy in relativel y small field trials conducted in Mexico, showing a 52.6% cysticercal prevalence reduction, 97.9% reduction in the number of cysticerci between vaccinated and control groups , and a significantly lower relative risk in vaccinated animals ( Huerta et al. , 2001 ) . In another study, there was no change in sentinel - pig prevalence, indicating limited impact of the vaccine at the population level ( Sciutto et al. , 2007 a ) . The S3Pvac vaccine has alternatively been developed with recombinant phage technology (S3Pvac - phage) to reduce production harian et al. , 2004 ) . Within this format, the S3Pvac - phage vaccine has significant ly reduced the prevalence of porcine cystic ercosis (by necropsy) in vaccinated animals when tested in larger Mexican field trials ( Morales et al. , 2008 b , 2011 ) . A study using a three - dose S3Pvac - phage regime , in conjunction with a health education programme in Guerrero State, Mexico ( de Aluja et al. , 2014 ) documented a statistically significant reduction in two out of three porcine cysticercosis prevalence measures (lingual pa lpation and ultrasound , but a non - significant reduction in antibody seroprevalence) over a three - year period, although there was substantial variation at village level in prevalence changes over time.

(2006) provided the first evidence for the impact of a combined intervention targeting human and pig hosts in Peru , reporting t hat on e round of human MDA with 5mg/kg PZQ plus two rounds of pig MDA with 30mg/kg OFZ significantly impacted transmission and decreased prevalence and seroincidence over 18 month s. Carabin and Traor\u00e9 (2014) highlighted that the Garcia et al . (2006) study may ha ve over estimated intervention effectiveness ( due to the randomisation approach used) and under estimated contamination within larger village s (due to the 'split' design of the study) . More recently, a regional proof - of - principle elimination strategy was tr ialled in Peru ( Garcia et al . , 2016 ) , consisting of three rounds of 4 - mont hly human MDA with NCZ, six rounds of 2 - monthly pig treatment with OFZ, and two rounds of 6 - monthly TSOL18 pig vaccination . This strategy achieved elimination over a large geographic al area as only degenerated, non - viable, cysts were found ( Garcia et al ., 2016 ) . However, this trial required intensive resources over a short (1 - year) ' attack phase ' , potentially limiting the feasibility of deploying similar approaches in poorly - resourced settings and programmatic situations outside of wel l - resourced research conditions. Also, there was no long - term follow up to examine whether elimination was sustained. A smaller - scale intervention study, aimed at one specific village in Lao PDR ( Okello e t al. , 201 6 ) used a similar combination of intervention s as the regional elimination study in Peru, but with larger intervals between intervention rounds to demonstrate interruption of transmission (defined by demonstrating statistically significant reduct ions i n human taeniasis prevalence). Both studies contribute to strengthen the ar gument for a One Health approach that targets the entire multi - host system ( Braae et al. , 2019; Thomas et al. , 2019 ) . Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 71 Elimination has also been demonstrated in a combined int ervention focussing on the pig host in Nepal ( Poudel et al. , 2019 ) , which used four rounds of both 3 - mont h ly pig treatment with OFZ and TSOL18 vaccination , and resulted in the absence of cysts in slaughter - weight animals as determined by necropsy in the in tervention area, 9 - 10 month s after the first intervention round (and therefore within the year of the study) . Poudel et al. ( 2019 ) suggest ed that the interventions tested in Nepal could provide a relatively simple and feasible intervention strategy that co uld be applied in poorly - resourced setting s, and that applying such strategy over a period of years may ultimately reduce the num ber of tapeworm carriers and the incidence of NCC .

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE D IRECTIONS Great strides have been made to wards unravelling the biology and epidemiology of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis, and towards understanding the effectiveness of interventions targeted to the various stages of the parasite's life - cycle, as documented in this work. Although progress has been impressive, fundamental q uestions focussing on the biology and epidemiology of T. solium remain important areas for future research. Some of the biggest unknowns relate to biological factors including the average lifespan ( and distribution of lifespa ns) of the T. solium adult mature tapeworm ; processes regulating parasite establishment and survival in humans and pigs; egg production and death rates (and whether abiotic factors influence egg dynamics) , and egg dispersal mechanisms ( Dixon et al. , 2019 ) . Exploring whether density - dependent processes also operate on the different life - cycle stages of T. solium , for example on parasite establishment and immunity processes, will be important to better understand epidemiological patterns ( Dixon et al. , 2020 ) . Determining rates of transmission using , for instance, age - (sero)prevalence (human and pig) data to estimate the F orce - of - I nfection (per - capita rate at which susceptible hosts become infected) can also help characterise how incidence patterns vary across geographies and ecological / epidemiological settings , and contribute to identify locale - appropriate suites of intervention strategies . Linked to this, geospatial mapping to define endemic areas and populations at risk, alongside mapping co - endemic areas with other helminth infections tackled with common treatments, such as schistosomiasis , is needed to provide a more comprehensive regional and global picture of prospects for T. solium control ( Dixon et al. , 2020 ) . At regional and smaller spatial scales, s patially - resolved infection datasets including pig movement between communities / households , along food value - chains, in conjunction with human m igration Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 75 patterns will help to elucidate spatial dynamics and address questions about risks of re - e mergence in near - elimination settings. A crucial area for further research is the development of diagnostics with improved performance and accuracy , and the potential for these methods to become suitable for large - scale use in field epidemiological surveys , monitorin g and evaluation of interventions, and post - intervention surveillance ( CystiTeam Group for Epidemiology , 2019 ) . Ideally, the use of such diagnostics would be integrated into other existing disease cont rol programmes to increase cost - effectiveness and improve understanding of important co - endemicities ( Katabarwa et al ., 2008 ). There are important limitations with the existing serological diagnostics, especially for porcine cysticercosis where cross - react ions occur with species ( 2018 ) or light infections are missed ( Sciutto et al. , 1998 ) , with necropsy being considered the gold standard . Use of necropsy , however , poses significant challenges to larg e - scale imp lement ation and particularly to longitudina l study design s . Finding serological diagnostic markers which represent true infection status, such as efforts towards validation in Zambia of the B158/B60 Ag - ELISA with necropsied animals ( Chembensofu et al. , 201 7 ) , represents the type of research required to improve the applicability of existing diagnostics. For human taeniasis or cysticercosis, a lateral - flow point - of - care (POC) version of the rESS33 - immunblot for human taeniasis ( Levine et al. 2004 ) , r TH24 - immunblot for human cysticercosis ( Hancock et al. , 2004, 2006 ) are currently undergoing validation studies at the community and primary health facility levels in Tanzania and Zambia ( SOLID Workgroup, 2020 ) . Should such a POC diagnostic prove effective , more extensive mapping will be feasible. The WHO neglected tropical diseases ( NTD ) roadmap of 2012 ( WHO, 2012 ) called for a validated strategy for T. solium control to enable scaling - up of interventions in selected Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis 76 countries by 2020 ; however , it is clear that these targets have not been met. A revised WHO NTD roadmap, covering the period of 2021 - 2030 identifie d a target of achieving , for 17 endemic countries, intensified control in hyperendemic areas by 2030 ( WHO, 2020 ) . The evidence - base for understandin g the impact of interventions applied solely or in combination has been expand ing, as presented in this work , but it is apparent that there are still priority areas of research to address, such as considering the longer - term sustainability of interventions , the dynamics of resurgence and/or re - introduction of infection when interventions cease, and conducting e conomic analy se s of the different intervention packages to ensure cost - effectivesness across both the human and animal health sectors . For example , t he cost - effectiveness of T. solium interventions w as assessed within integrated NTD programmes in Lao PDR ( Okello et al. , 2018 ) , with similar studies still needed in different endemic settings . The recently devised metric to capture broader costs associate d with zoonotic diseases, including animal costs alongside human costs, through a zoonotic DALY framework (zDALY) ( Torgerson et al. , 2018 ) would facilitate s uch cross - sectoral assessments. The further development and application of transmission dynamics mo delling can also support the design and assessment of interventions, especially by simulating their epidemiological impact on temporal infection trends (e.g. for i nterventions implemented over longer timeframe s), fitting to data obtained in intervention tr ials, and investigating infection dynamics after cessation of intervention programmes , ideally under a modelling comparison umbrella (such as conducted for other NTDs by the NTD Modelling Consortium ; see Walker et al ., 2017 for onchocerciasis) . A key step in this process is the calibration, comparison and validation of existing T. solium transmission dynamics models (e.g., the population - based, deterministic EPICYST model ( Winskill et al. et al ., 2018 )) with longitudinal Matthew A. Dixon et al . Advances in Parasitology 77 intervention datasets ( Dixon et al. , 2019 ) , such that crucial assumptions can be tested and model outcomes compared . Importantly, transmission dynamics models can be used to link infection d ynamic s with burden of disease assessments to help understand and quantify the relationship between infection and morbi - mortality, and the effectiveness of interventions in reducing disease burden , a key step for cost - effectiveness analysis ( CystiTeam Group for Epidemiology of spatially - explicit , individual - based models is also an important avenue of further research that would allow inclusion of behavioural parameters such as pig roam ing, open human defecation, and human movement within a spatial framework , as recently shown by Pray et al . (2020) , who have developed the CystiAgent model . I ndividual - based models would permit investigation of the influence of heterogeneity in individual host exposure ( and immune - mediated susceptibility) with in a stochastic framework that would facilitate exploration of elimination probabilities resulting from interventions and resurgence dynamics following their cessation ( Hamley et al ., 2019 ; Hamley et ., 2020 ).
