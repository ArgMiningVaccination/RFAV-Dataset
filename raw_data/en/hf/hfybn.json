You need exfoliating pads. From glycolic acid pads to lactic acid pads, we rounded up the best exfoliating pads available.", "sitename": "Byrdie", "date": "2018-06-04", "cleaned_text": "Long gone are the days where exfoliating meant using physically abrasive scrubs such as sea salt to improve the appearance of our skin. [Chemical exfoliation](https://www.byrdie.com/best-chemical-exfoliators) is the new standard in terms of solving skin woes such as acne scars and blemishes, [dark spots](https://www.byrdie.com/how-to-get-rid-of-dark-spots), hyper-pigmentation, and cellulite, to name a few. In its most basic form, exfoliating scrubs away dead skin while breaking down acne-forming bacteria that [clog your pores](https://www.byrdie.com/how-to-unclog-pores-4686861), which prevents acne and blackheads from forming. And now, that is made even easier and less time-consuming with exfoliating pads. \"One of the greatest benefits of an exfoliating pad is the convenience factor,\" explains dermatological nurse and celebrity aesthetician Natalie Aguilar. Aguilar explains that exfoliating pads are a convenient way to get a chemical exfoliation. \"Pre-mixed solutions with a pad have removed the inconvenience of having separate products and have made it easy for suitable skin types to pick up a pad and wipe across face, neck, d\u00e9collet\u00e9 or body.\" In addition to that, exfoliating pads will have other additional benefits for the skin thanks to ingredients. To put it simply, there is a lot that you can include in exfoliating pad form. Whether you have [sensitive skin](https://www.byrdie.com/what-is-sensitive-skin) or oily skin, there's definitely a pad out there for you. We conducted hours of research on the best exfoliating pads, evaluating each based on active ingredients meant to chemically exfoliate: namely salicylic, glycolic, or lactic acids. We looked at how these pads combine acids\u2014and what concentration of acids is used\u2014for the best exfoliation possible without irritating skin. We considered different skin types and concerns to find which pads work most effectively. After consulting with a dermatological nurse, and considering dozens of different options, we landed on these picks. Here is a list of some of the best exfoliating pads to uncomplicate your beauty routine.

What To Look for in Exfoliating Pads Actives and Ingredients \"Active ingredients such as gentle acids are best for frequent use such as [vitamin C](https://www.byrdie.com/vitamin-c-benefits) (ascorbic acid) as well as lactic acid and most fruit acids such as citric and malic acid,\" says Aguilar. \"These have a long reputation for being gentle, effective, and safe for long-term use.\" Lactic acid, found in many of the selects above, including [SkinParm's Clarifying Pads](https://skinpharm.com/products/clarifying-pads), contain lactic acid to help keep skin hydrated. We also love the [Kinship Insta Swipe Lemon Honey AHA Exfoliating Pads](https://www.ulta.com/p/insta-swipe-lemon-honey-aha-exfoliating-pads-pimprod2017742), which contain hydrating and soothing manuka honey to help nourish skin and prevent irritation. Some ingredients you do want to avoid are alcohol, fragrance, acetone, and parabens. Concentration You want to be careful to not overdo it. Over-exfoliation can disrupt the skin's natural barrier and cause long-term damage. \"If you are new to exfoliating pads, this is not something that you need to jump into the deep end with. This is a slow and steady process. You can start with something lower. Do a product for a couple of months and see how your skin handles it,\" Dr. Nazarian recommends. \"You're not going to waste your time if you start with a weaker product. You're going to avoid a lot of the pitfalls that happen when people just go straight for the strongest.\" Gentle Ingredients It's always best to start with gentle ingredients and work your way up to higher doses as your skin familiarizes itself with the strengths. Also, keep in mind that the active ingredients make the skin more sensitive to the sun, so you'll need to be more diligent about sunscreen use. Dr. Nazarian recommends that you should be pairing exfoliation with a broad spectrum SPF every morning of at least 30. - How Often Should You Use Exfoliating Pads? Dr. Nazarian and Aguilar both advise no more than two times a week. \"I prefer using my exfoliating pads before bed as our skin rejuvenates overnight,\" adds Aguilar. \"We can also finish with a beautiful layer of rich nighttime moisturizer on top. In addition, it also gives the skin a break before any sun exposure.\" - Are Exfoliating Pads Safe for All Skin Types? Generally speaking, yes. However, it is important to pay attention to the ingredients and choose the right exfoliating pad for your skin type. Aguilar says \"one should look for ingredients that address their unique skin concerns.\" She also cautioned against using [trichloroacetic acid](https://www.byrdie.com/what-is-a-tca-peel-5101216)(aka TCA) as well as high percentages of salicylic or glycolic acid. Keep in mind that if you don't want to use an exfoliating pad, there are other types of [facial exfoliators](https://www.byrdie.com/best-face-exfoliators-4584298). - What Are Some Signs That I Am Over-Exfoliating? Dry, easily irritated, and inflamed skin are typically signs that you're overdoing it and might need to dial down on the exfoliation. \"Peeling and flaking are not necessary for the type of peel we're talking about here,\" Dr. Nazarian explains. \"That means you are exfoliating faster than your skin can make new skin cells.\" One tip she recommends for repairing the skin is to use a gentle, non-foaming wash for at least a week followed by [emollients](https://www.byrdie.com/emollients-for-skin-4774700)and humectants like hyaluronic acid that is sealed with a little bit of vaseline.\" - Is It Safe for People With Skin Conditions Like Rosacea and Keratosis keratosis pilaris to exfoliate daily; ensuring that they are not experiencing irritation or over-exfoliation. Gentle exfoliation helps to remove oils that allow bacteria to flourish and the dry, dead superficial layer of skin that often prevents your products from penetrating the skin effectively. I love exfoliating pads with lactic acid or mandelic acid for these skin types.\" Why Trust Byrdie Byrdie contributor [Danielle Ransom](https://www.byrdie.com/danielle-ransom-5185924) is an NYC-based writer and has covered a myriad of topics ranging across beauty, fashion, and lifestyle.
