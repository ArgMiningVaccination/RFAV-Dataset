Through this needs assessment, collaborative community partners have identified numerous health issues impacting individuals and families in the LaSalle County region. Several themes are prevalent in this health -needs assessment - the demographic composition of the LaSalle County region, the predictors for and prevalence of diseases, leading causes of mortality, accessibility to health services and healthy behaviors. Results from this study can be used for strategic decision- making purposes as they directly relate to the health needs of the community. The study was designed to assess issues and trends impacting the communities served by the collaborative, as well as perceptions of targeted stakeholder groups. This study includes a detailed analysis of secondary data to assess information regarding the health status of the community. In order to perform these analyses, information was collected from numerous secondary sources, including publicly available sources as well as private sources of data. Additionally, CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 4 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 primary data were collected for the general population and the at- risk or economically disadvantaged population. Areas of investigation included perceptions of the community health issues, unhealthy behaviors, issues with quality of life, healthy behaviors and access to medical care, dental care, prescription medications and mental -health counseling. Additionally, demographic characteristics of respondents were utilized to provide insights into why certain segments of the population responded differently. Ultimately, the identification and prioritization of the most important health -related issues in the LaSalle County region were identified. The collaborative team considered health needs based on: (1) magnitude of the issue (i.e., what percentage of the popu lation was impacted by the issue); (2) severity of the issue in terms of its relationship with morbidities and mortalities; (3) potential impact through collaboration. Using a modified version of the Hanlon Method, three significant health needs were identified and determined to have equal priority: Healthy Behaviors - defined as active living and healthy eating, and their impact on obesity Behavioral Health - including mental health and substance abuse Healthy Aging I. INTRODUCTION Background The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), enacted March 23, 2010, added new requirements for tax -exempt charitable hospital organizations to conduct community health needs assessments and to adopt implementation strategies to meet the community health needs identified through the assessments. This community health needs assessment (CHNA) takes into account input from specific individuals who represent the broad interests of the community served by LaSalle County Health Department and OSF St. Elizabeth and St. Paul Medical Centers including those with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. For th is study, a community health -needs assessment is defined as a systematic process involving the community, to identify and analyze community health needs and assets in order to prioritize these needs, create a plan, and act upon unmet community health needs . Results from this assessment will be made widely available to the public. This CHNA Report was approved by the OSF HealthCare System's Board of Directors with respect to OSF St. Elizabeth and St. Paul Medical Centers on July 25, 2022. The structure of the CHNA is based on standards used by the Internal Revenue Service to develop Form 990, Schedule H -Hospitals, designated solely for tax -exempt charitable hospital organizations. The fundamental areas of the community health needs assessment are illustrated in Figure 1. CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 5 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 1 Collaborative Team and Community Engagement In order to engage the entire community in the CHNA process, a collaborative team of health -professional experts and key community advocates was created. Members of the collaborative team were carefully selected to ensure representation of the broad interests of the community. Specifically, team members included representatives from OSF Saint Elizabeth and OSF Saint Paul Medical Centers, members of the LaSalle County Health Department, and administrators from key community partner organizations. Engagement occurred throughout the entire process, resulting in shared ownership of the assessment. The entire collaborative team met in the first and second quarter of 2022. Additionally, numerous meetings were held between the facilitators and specific individual s during the process. Specifically, members of the Collaborative Team consisted of individuals with special knowledge of and expertise in the healthcare of the community. Note that the collaborative team provided input for all sections of the CHNA. Individuals, affiliations, titles and expertise can be found in APPENDIX 1: MEMBERS OF COLLABORATIVE TEAM. Definition of the Community OSF Saint Elizabeth and OSF Saint Paul Medical Centers each define their community as constituting LaSalle County. In order to determine the geographic boundaries for OSF Saint Elizabeth and OSF Saint Paul Medical Centers, analyses were completed to identify what percentage of inpatient and outpatient activity was represented by LaSalle County. Data show that LaSalle County repr esent 88% of all patients for the hospitals. Purpose of the Community Health- Needs Assessment In the initial meeting, the collaborative committee identified the purpose of this study. Specifically , this study has been designed to provide necessary information to health -care organizations, including hospitals, clinics and health departments, in order to create strategic plans in program design, access and delivery. Results of this study will act as a platform that allows health -care organizations to orches trate CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 6 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 limited resources to improve management of high -priority challenges. By working together, hospitals, clinics, agencies and health departments will use this CHNA to improve the quality of healthcare in LaSalle County. When feasible, data are assessed longitudinally to identify trends and patterns by comparing with results from the 2019 CHNA and benchmarked with State of Illinois averages. Community Feedback from Previous Assessments The OSF Saint Elizabeth and OSF Saint Paul Medical Center joint 2019 CHNA and implementation plan were made widely available to the community to allow for feedback. Specifically, the hospitals posted both a full version and a summary version of the 2019 CHNA on their websites. In order to encourage written feedback, the hos pitals' websites specifically included a section labeled Share Your Feedback and provided instructions regarding how individuals from the community could provide comments to the CHNA. While no written feedback was received by individuals from the community via the available mechanism, verbal feedback regarding the joint CHNA and implementation plan was provided by key stakeholders from community -service organizations and incorporated as part of the collaborative process. 2019 CHNA Health Needs and Implemen tation Plans The joint 2019 LaSalle County CHNA for both OSF St. Elizabeth and OSF St. Paul Medical Centers identified two significant health needs. These included: healthy behaviors, defined as active living and healthy eating, and their impact on obesity and behavioral health, including mental health and substance abuse. Specific actions were taken to address these needs. Detailed discussions of goals and strategies to improve these health needs can be seen in APPENDIX 2: ACTIVITIES RELATED TO 2019 CHNA PRIORITIZED NEEDS. Note that numerous challenges associated with the COVID -19 pandemic had significant impact on these activities. Social Determinants of Health This CHNA incorporates important factors associated with Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). SDOH are important environmental factors, such as where people are born, live, work and play, that affect people's well- being, physical and mental health, and quality of life. According to research conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy People 2030 has identified five SDOH that should be included in assessing community health (Figure 2). CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 7 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 2 Healthy People 2030, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Retriev ed January 15, 2022, from https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives -and-data/social -determinants -health Assessment of SDOH is included in the CHNA, as social determinants help contribute to health inequities and disparities. Simply creating interventions without incorporating SDOH will have limited impact on improving community health for people living in underserved or at- risk areas. II. METHODS To complete the comprehensive community health -needs assessment, multiple sources were examined. Secondary statistical data were used to assess the community profile, morbidity rates and causes of mortality. Additionally, a study was completed to examine perceptions of the community health -related issues, healthy behaviors, behavioral health, food security, social determinants of health and ac cess to healthcare. CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 8 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Secondary Data Collection Existing secondary statistical data were first used to develop an overall assessment of health -related issues in the community. Within each section of the report, there are definitions, importance of categories, data and interpretations. At the end of each chapter, there is a section on key takeaways. Based on several retreats, a separate OSF Collaborative Team used COMPdata Informatics (affiliated with Illinois Health and Hospital Association (IHA)) to identif y six primary categories of diseases, including: age related, cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, diabetes and infections. In order to define each disease category, modified definitions developed by Sg2 were used. Sg2 specializes in consulting for health -care organizations. Their team of experts includes MDs, PhDs, RNs and health -care leaders with extensive strategic, operational, clinical, academic, technological and financial experience. Primary Data Collection In addition to existing secondary data so urces, primary survey data were also collected. This section describes the research methods used to collect, code, verify and analyze primary survey data. Specifically, the research design used for this study: survey design, data collection and data integ rity. Survey Instrument Design Initially, all publicly available health -needs assessments in the U.S. were assessed to identify common themes and approaches to collecting community health -needs data. By leveraging best practices from these surveys, a new s urvey in 2021 was designed for use with both the general population and the at- risk community. To ensure that all critical areas were being addressed, the entire collaborative team was involved in survey design/approval through several fact- finding sessio ns. Additionally, several focus groups were used to collect the qualitative information necessary to design survey items. Specifically, for the community health -needs assessment, eight specific sets of items were included: Ratings of health issues in the community - to assess the importance of various community health concerns. Survey items included assessments of topics such as cancer, diabetes and obesity. Ratings of unhealthy behaviors in the community - to assess the importance of various unhealthy behaviors. Survey items included assessments of topics such as violence, drug abuse and smoking. Ratings of issues concerning well -being - to assess the importance of various issues relating to well -being in the community. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to healthcare, safer neighborhoods and effective public transportation. Accessibility to healthcare - to assess the degree to which residents could access healthcare when needed. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to medical, dental and mental - healthcare, as well as access to prescription medication. Healthy behaviors - to assess the degree to which residents exhibited healthy behaviors. The survey items included assessments of topics such as exercise, healthy eating habits and cancer screenings. Behavioral health - to assess community issues related to areas such as anxiety and depression. Food security - to assess access to healthy food alternatives. Soci al determinants of health - to assess the impact that social determinants may have on the above -mentioned areas. CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 9 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Finally, demographic information was collected to assess background information necessary to segment markets in terms of the eight categories discussed above. A copy of the final survey is included in APPENDIX 3: SURVEY Sample Size In order to identify our potential population, we first identified the percentage of the LaSalle County population that was living in poverty. Specifically, we mu ltiplied the population of the county by its respective poverty rate to identify the minimum sample size to study the at- risk population. The poverty rate for LaSalle County is 11.4 percent. The population used for the calculation was 107,689 yielding a total of 12, 277 residents living in poverty in the LaSalle County area. A normal approximation to the hypergeometric distribution was assumed given the targeted sample size. n = (Nz2pq)/(E2 (N -1) + z2 pq) where: n = the required sample size N = the population size z = the value that specified the confidence interval (use 95% CI) pq = population proportions (set at .05) E =desired accuracy of sample proportions (set at +/ - .05) To provide a representative profile when assessing the aggregated population for the LaSalle County region, the general population was combined with a portion of the at- risk population. To represent the at-risk population as a percentage of the aggregate population, a random -number generator was used to select at- risk cases to include in the general sample. Additionally, efforts were made to ensure that the demography of the sample was aligned with population demographics according to U.S. Census data. This provided a total usable sample of 729 respondents for analyzing the aggregate population. Sample characteristics can be seen in APPENDIX 4: CHARACTERISTICS OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS. Counties were then weighted based on population size. Data Collection Survey data were collected in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2021. To collect data in this study, two techniques were used. First, an online version of the survey was created. Second, a paper version of the survey was distributed. In order to be sensitive to the needs of respondents, surveys stressed assurance of complete anonymity. N ote that versions of both the online survey and paper survey were translated into Spanish. To specifically target the at- risk population, surveys were distributed at homeless shelters, food pantries and soup kitchens. Since the at- risk population was specifically targeted as part of the data collection effort, this became a stratified sample, as other groups were not specifically targeted based on their socio- economic status. CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 10 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Note that use of electronic surveys to collect community -level data may create a potential for bias from convenience sampling error. To recognize for potential bias in the community sample, a second control sample of data was collected. Specifically, the control sample consisted of random patients surveyed at the hospital, assuming t hat patients receiving care represent an unbiased representation of the community. All questions on the patient version of the survey pertaining to access to healthcare were removed, as these questions were not relevant to current patients. Data from the c ommunity sample and the control sample were compared using t- tests and tetrachoric correlations when appropriate. Results show that the community sample did not exhibit any significance patterns of bias. If specific relationships exhibited a potential for bias between the community sample and the control sample, they are identified in the social -determinants sections of the analyses within each chapter. Data Integrity Comprehensive analyses were performed to verify the integrity of the data for this researc h. Without proper validation of the raw data, any interpretation of results could be inaccurate and misleading if used for decision -making. Therefore, several tests were performed to ensure that the data were valid. These tests were performed before any analyses were undertaken. Data were checked for coding accuracy, using descriptive frequency statistics to verify that all data items were correct. This was followed by analyses of means and standard deviations and comparison of primary data statistics to existing secondary data. Analytic Techniques To ensure statistical validity, several different analytic techniques were used. Specifically, frequencies and descriptive statistics were used for identifying patterns in residents' ratings of various hea lth concerns. Additionally, appropriate statistical techniques were used for identification of existing relationships between perceptions, behaviors and demographic data. Specifically, Pearson correlations, X 2 tests and tetrachoric correlations were used when appropriate, given characteristics of the specific data being analyzed.

Population data provide an overview of population growth trends and build a foundation for additional analysis of data. Population Growth Data from the last census indicate the population of LaSalle County has slightly decreased (1.8%) between 2017 and 2021 (Figure 3). Figure 3 Source: US Census 109,622109,159108,669108,179107,689Population Growth LaSalle County 2017 -2021 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 12 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.2 Age, Gender and Race Distribution Importance of the measure: Population data broken down by age, gender, and race groups provide a foundation to analyze the issues and trends that impact demographic factors including economic growth and the distributio n of healthcare services. Understanding the cultural diversity of communities is essential when considering health -care infrastructure and service delivery systems. Age Figure 4 illustrates the percentage of individuals in LaSalle County in each age grou p. Of note, the elderly population (residents aged 65+ years) increased 10.2% between 2015 and 2019. Figure 4 Source: US Census Gender The gender distribution of LaSalle County (Figure 5) residents has remained relatively consistent between 2017 and 2019. 0-19 years 20-34 years 35-49 years 50-64 years 65+ yearsAge Distribution LaSalle 2015 -2019 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 13 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 5 Source: US Census Race With regard to race and ethnic background, LaSalle County is largely homogenous, yet in recent years, the county is becoming more diverse. Data from 2019 suggest that White ethnicity comprises 84.6% of the populati on in LaSalle County. However, the non- White population of LaSalle County has been increasing (from 13.9% in 2017 to 15.4% in 2019), with Black ethnicity comprising 2.9% of the population, multi-racial ethnicity comprising 1.4% of the population, and Hisp anic/Latino (LatinX) ethnicity comprising 10.3% of the population (Figure White Black and African American Hispanic/Latino Asian Two or More Races American Indian/Alaska Native CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 14 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.3 Household/Family Importance of the measure: Families are an important component of a robust society in LaSalle County, as they dramatically impact the health and development of children and provide support and well -being for older adults. As indicated in Figure 7, the number of family households in LaSalle County increased from 2017 to 2019. Figure 7 Source: US Census Family Composition In LaSalle County, data from 2019 suggest the percentage of two -parent families in LaSalle County is 48.8%. One -person households represent 35% of the county population and single- female households represent 11.4% and single- male households represent 4.8% (Figure 8). 29,605 32,971 Number of 2017 -2019 2017 2019 CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 15 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 8 Source: US Census Early Sexual Activity Leading to Births from Teenage Mothers LaSalle County has experienced a slight fluctuation in teenage birth count. The teen birth count steadily declined in 2018 and 2019 (Figure 9). Figure 9 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health 1.4 Economic Information Importance of the measure: Median income divides households into two segments with one- half of households earning more than the median income and the other half earning less. Because median 48.8% 11.4%4.8%35.0%Household Types LaSalle County 2019 Two-parent Families Single Female Single Male One Person 8488 91 6256Teen Births LaSalle County 2015 -2019 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 16 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 income is not significantly impacted by unusually high or low -income values, it is considered a more reliable indicator than average income. To live in poverty means to lack sufficient income to meet one's basic needs. Accordingly, poverty is associated with numerous chronic social, health, education and employment conditions. Economic Climat e Economic climate is a measure of a community's financial resources and resiliency. Key risk influencers include income, cost of living and opportunity. For LaSalle County, 25% of the population is at elevated risk for economic climate. This is lower th an the State of Illinois average of 35% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). Median Income Level For 2019, the median household income in LaSalle County was lower than the State of Illinois (Figure 10). Figure 10 Source: US Census Unemployment For the years 2016 to 2020, except 2018, the LaSalle County unemployment rate was higher than the State of Illinois unemployment rate. However, in 2020 the rate significantly increased higher than State of Illinois. Some of the increase in unemployment in 2020 may be attributed to the COVID -19 pandemic (Figure 11). 49,792 65,886 Median Household Income (USD) LaSalle County 2019 LaSalle County State of Illinois CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 17 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 11 Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics Individuals in Poverty In LaSalle County, the percentage of individuals living in poverty between 2017 and 2019 decreased by 2.2%. The poverty rate for individuals is 11.4%, which is equal to the State of Illinois individual poverty rate of 11.4%. Poverty has a significant impact on the development of children and youth. (Figure 12). Figure 12 Source: US Census LaSalle County State of Illinois6.6% 5.7%6.3% 2019 2020 2017 2019 State Rate LaSalle County 2017 -2019 CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 18 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.5 Education Importance of the measure: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics1, \"The better educated a person is, the more likely that person is to report being in 'excellent' or 'very good' health, regardless of income.\" Research suggests that the higher the level of educational attainment and the more successful one is in school, the better one's health will be and the greater likelihood of one selecting healthy lifestyle choices. Accordingly, years of education is strongly related to an individual's propensity to earn a higher salary, gain better employment, and foster multifaceted success in life. High School Graduation Rates Students who entered 9th grade in 2017 in LaSalle County school districts were at or above the State averages for graduation rates, except Mendota Township HS, Ottawa Township HS and Streator Township HS, which reported lower rates (Figure 13). Figure 13 Source: Illinois Report Card 1.6 Internet Accessibility Survey respondents were asked if they had Internet access. Of respondents, 95% indicated they had Internet in their homes. For those who did not have Internet in their home, cost was the most frequently cited reason (Figure 14). Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percent ages given the low number of responses. 1 NCES 2005 88%95%91% 83%79%85%86%4-Year High School Graduation Rates (Students who entered 9th grade in 2017) LaSalle County Earlville Jr/Sr HS Leland State of Illinios CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 19 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 14 Source: CHNA Survey Digital Landscape Digital landscape is a community's access to digital tools and the digital literacy to use them. Key risk influencers include affordability, accessibility and digital literacy. For LaSalle County, 10% of the population is at elevated risk for digital landscape. This is similar to the State of Illinois average of 9% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). Social Determinants Related to Internet Access Several factors show significant relationships with an individual's Internet access. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Access to Internet tends to be higher for younger people, White people, those with higher education, those with higher income. Internet access tends to be lower for people in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. 18 76 43 1Causes of Inability to Have Internet in Home LaSalle County 2022 Cost Don't know how No provider No Phone/Computer Poor Service Data limits CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 20 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.7 Key Takeaways from Chapter 1 POPULATION DECREASED OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS.

Therefore, accessibility to healthcare must address both the associated financial costs and the supply and demand of medical services. Choice of Medical Care Survey respondents were asked to select the type of health -care facility used when sick. Six different alternatives were presented, including clinic or doctor's office, emergency department, urgent- care facility, health department, no medical treatment and other. The most common response for source of medical care was clinic/doctor's office, chosen by 65% of survey respondents. This was followed by urgent care (22%), not seeking medical attention (12%), the emergency department at a hospital (2%) and the health department (0%) (Figure 15). CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 22 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 15 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Clinic/doctor's office and urgent care facility usage has decreased slightly since 2019. Those that don't seek care have increase by 4%. Emergency department usage has remained unchanged. Social Determinants Related to Choice of Medical Care Several factors show significant relationships with an individual's choice of medical care. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Clinic/Doctor's Office tends to be used more often by women, older people, and White people. Clinics/doctor's office tend to be used less by people in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Urgent Care tends to be used more by younger people, White people, those with higher education and higher income. Emergency Department tends to be used more by those with lower income and by people in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment.

Social Determinants Related to Type of Insurance Several characteristics show significant relationships with an individual's type of insurance. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Medicare tends to be used more frequently by older people, White people and those with lower income. Medicare tends to be used less frequently by LatinX people. Medicaid tends to be used more frequently by younger people, those with lower income and people with an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Commercial/employer insurance is used more often by younger people, and those with higher education, those with higher income. Commercial/employer insurance is used less often by people with an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. No Insurance tends to be reported more often by LatinX people and people with an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Given the low survey response rate for LatinX people, findings should be interpreted with caution. Access to Care In the CHNA survey, respondents were asked, \"Was there a time when you needed care but were not able to get it?\" Access to four types of care were assessed: medical care, prescription medications, dental care and counseling. Survey results show that 17% of the population did not have access to medical care when needed; 15% of the population did not have access to prescription medication when needed; 23% of the population did not have access to dental care when needed; and 14% of the population did not have access to counseling when needed (Figure 18). CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 25 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 18 Source: CHNA Survey Social Determinants Related to Access to Care Several characteristics show a significant relationship with an individual's ability to access care when needed. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Access to medical care tends to be higher for older people, White people and those with those with higher income. LatinX people are less likely to have access to medical care. Access to prescription medication tends to be higher for White people, those with higher education and those with higher income. Access to prescription medication tends to be lower for Black people. Access to dental care tends to be higher for White people, those with higher education and those with higher income. Access to dental care tends to be lower for Black people. Access to counseling tends to be higher for older people, White people and those with higher income. Reasons for No Access - Medical Care Survey respondents who reported they were not able to get medical care when needed were asked a follow -up question. The leading causes of the inability to gain access to medical care were too long to wait for an appointment (57), the inability to afford the copay (31) no insurance (22) and no trust (21). Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percentages given the low number of responses (Figure 19).

Transportation Network Transportation network is a measure of the adequacy of the transportation network to facilitate access to care . Key risk influencers include access and proximity to resources. While survey data indicate transportation was not a leading cause of inaccessibility, for LaSalle County, 17% of the population is at elevated risk for transportation network. This is higher than the State of Illinois average of 6% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). 2.2 W ellness Importance of the measure: Preventative health -care measures, including getting a flu shot, engaging in a healthy lifestyle and undertaking screenings for diseases are essential to combating morbidity and mortality while reducing health -care costs . The overall health of a community is impacted by preventative measures including immunizations and vaccinations. 4138 2219 18 1413 139Causes of Inability to Access Counseling LaSalle County 2022 Could Not Find Wait Too Long Could Not Afford Co-Pay Embarrassment No Trust No Insurance Counselor Refused Insurance Transportation Discrimination CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 29 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Frequency of Flu Shots Figure 23 shows that the percentage of people who have had a flu shot in the past year is 33% for LaSalle County, whi ch is slightly lower than the State of Illinois average (34.5%). Note that data have not been updated by the Illinois Department of Public Health. Figure 23 Source: CHNA Survey COVID -19 Vaccinations Figure 24 shows the percentage of people who have been fully vaccinated from the COVID -19 virus as of February 27, 2022. Although LaSalle County remains above half at 57.3%, they remain under the rate for the State of Illinois at 63.6%. Additionally, given the recency of the COVID -19 virus, no historical comparisons are made at this time.

Social Determinants Related to Having a Personal Physician The following characteristic shows a significant relationship with having a personal physician. The following relationship was found using correlational analyses: Having a personal physician was higher for older people. Cancer Screening Early detection of cancer may greatly improve the probability of successful treatment. In the case of colorectal cancer, early detection of precancerous polyps can prevent cancer. Specifically, four types of cancer screening were measured: breast, cervical, prostate and colorectal. Results from the CHNA surve y show that 63% of women had a breast screening in the past five years and 69% of women had a cervical screening. For men, 44% had a prostate screening in the past five years. For women and men over the age of 50, 63% had a colorectal screening in the last five years (Figure 26). Figure 26 Source: CHNA Survey 63%69% 44%63%Cancer Screening in Past 5 years LaSalle County 2022 Breast (for women) Cervical (for women) Prostate (for men) Colorectal (over age 50) CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 32 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Comparison to 2019 CHNA Survey results for having a breast screening (8%) decreased; however, there was an increase for prostate screening (15%) and colorectal screening (5%). This is the first year the CHNA collected data for cervical screening so no comparison was possible. Social Determinants Related to Cancer Screenings Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with cancer screening. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Breast screening tends to be more likely for older women, those with a higher level of education and higher income. LatinX women, Black women and those in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment are less likely to have a breast screening. Cervical screening tends to be more likely for White women, those with a higher level of education and higher income. LatinX women and those in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment is less likely to have a cervical screening. Prostate screening tends to be rated higher by older men and those with higher income. Prostate screening was less likely for LatinX men. Colorectal screening tends to be more likely for men, older people and White people. Colorectal screening tends to be less likely for LatinX people. Physical Exercise A healthy lifestyle, comprised of regular physical activity, has been shown to increase physical, mental, and emotional well -being. Specifically, 22% of respondents indicated that they do not exercise at all, while the majority (64%) of residents exercise 1- 5 times per week (Figure 27). CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 33 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 27 Source: CHNA Survey To find out why some residents do not exercise at all, a follow up question was asked. Similar to the 2019 CHNA, the most common reasons for not exercising are not having enough energy (29%), not enough time (22%) and a dislike of exercise (16%) (Figure 28). Figure 28 Source: CHNA Survey 22%31%33% 14%Days of Exercise in Last Week LaSalle County 2022 I Don't 1 to 2 days per week 3 to 5 days per week More than 5 per week 29% 22% 16% 11% 9% 7% 7%Reasons Did Not Exercise in Last Week LaSalle County 2022 Too tired No time Don't like Safety Connot afford Child care Access CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 34 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Comparison to 2019 CHNA There has been a slight increase in the number of people who exercise. In 2019, 28% of residents indicated they did not exercise at all and only 22% indicated they did not exercise in 2022. Social Determinants Related to Exercise Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with cancer screening. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Frequency of exercise was rated higher by men, older people, those with higher education and those with higher income. Healthy Eating A healthy lifestyle, comprised of a proper diet, has been shown to increase physical, mental and emotional well -being. Consequently, nutrition and diet are critical to preventative care. Almost two- thirds (64%) of residents report no consumption or low consumption (1 -2 servings per day) of fruits and vegetables per day. Note that the percentage of residents who consume five or more servings per day is only 4% (Figure 29). Figure 29 Source: CHNA Survey Those individuals who indicated they do not eat any fruits or vegetables were asked a follow up question.

Figure 30 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results show a decline in eating fruits and vegetables, where 56% of respondents indicated they had two or fewer servings of fruits and vegetables per day in 2019 compared to 64% in 2022. Social Determinants Related to Healthy Eating Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with healthy eating. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Consumption of fruits and vegetables tends to be more likely for older people, White people and those with a higher education. Consumption of fruits and vegetables tends to be less likely for Black people. Restricted Diet Responde nts were also asked if they followed a restricted diet if recently diagnosed with a morbidity. Of respondents, 41% usually or always follow a restricted diet (Figure 31). 14 8 7 4 2 10Reasons Do Not Eat Fruits and Vegetables LaSalle County 2022 I don't like Not important Cannot afford Transportation Cannot prepare Don't know where to buy No refrigerator/stove CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 36 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 31 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results show no significant change compared to 2019 CHNA results. Health Literacy Health literacy is a measure of factors in the community that impact healthcare access, navigation and adherence. Key risk influencers include culture, demographics and education. For LaSalle County, 20% of the population is at elevated risk for health literacy. This is lower than the State of Illinois average of 34% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2 022). 2.3 Understanding Food Insecurity Importance of the measure: It is essential that everyone has access to food and drink necessary for living healthy lives. Food insecurity exists when people don't have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for a healthy life. Prevalence of Hunger Respondents were asked, \"How many days a week do you or your family members go hungry?\" The vast majority of respondents indicated they do not go hungry, however, 2% indicated they go hungry 1 to 2 days per week (Figure 32). 20%39% 29% 12%Follow A Restricted Diet LaSalle County 2022 Never Sometimes Usually Always CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 37 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 32 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results show a 3% decrease compared to 2019 CHNA results for those who go hungry. Social Determinants Related to Prevalence of Hunger Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with hunger. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Prevalence of Hunger tends to be more likely for younger people, Black people, those with less education and those with less income. Primary Source of Food Respondents were asked to identify their primary source of food. It can be seen that the majority (95%) identified a gr ocery store (Figure 33). 98% 2%0%How Often Go Hungry LaSalle County 2022 None 1 to 2 days per week 3 to 5 days per week CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 38 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 33 Source: CHNA Survey Food Landscape Food landscape is a measure of the conditions that affect the ability of residents to access healthy, affordable nutrition. Key risk influencers include accessibility, affordability and literacy. For LaSalle County, 25% of the population is at elevated risk for food landscape . This is the same as the State of Illinois average of 25%. (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). 2.4 Physical Environment Importance of the measure: According to the County Health Rankings, Air Pollution - Particulate Matter (APPM) is the average daily density of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) in a county. Fi ne particulate matter is defined as particles of air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. These particles can be directly emitted from sources such as forest fires, or they can form when gases are emitted from power plants, manufacturing facilities and automobiles. The relationship between elevated air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter and ozone, and compromised health has been well documented. Negative consequences of ambient air pollution include decreased lung function, chronic bronchitis, asthma and other adverse pulmonary effects. The APPM for LaSalle County (12) is slightly higher than the State average of 11.5 (Figure 34). 95% 2% 1% 1% 1% 0% 0%Primary Source of Food County 2022 Grocery Store Fast food Food pantry Farm/garden Convenience store Food delivery Gas station CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 39 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 34 Source: County Health Rankings 2021 2.5 Health Status Importance of the measure: Self-perceptions of health can provide important insights to help manage population health. Not only do self -perceptions provide benchmarks regarding health status, but they can also provide insights into how accurately people p erceive their own health. Mental Health The survey asked respondents to indicate specific issues, such as depression and stress/anxiety. Of respondents, 51% indicated they did not feel depressed in the last 30 days (Figure 35) and 56% indicated they did not feel anxious or stressed (Figure 36). 12 11.5Air Pollution -Particulate Matter LaSalle County 2020 LaSalle County State of Illinois CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 40 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 35 Source: CHNA Survey Figure 36 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results show an increase (8%) in the number of people that have experienced depression in the last 30 days and an increase (5%) in the number of people that have experienced anxiety/stress in the last 30 days. 51% 24% 13% 12%Felt Depressed Last 30 Days LaSalle County 2022 I Don't 1 to 2 3 to 5 More than 5 56% 24% 10% 10%Felt Anxious or Stressed Last 30 Days LaSalle County 2022 I Don't 1 to 2 3 to 5 More than 5 CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 41 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Respondents were also asked if they spoke with anyone about their mental health in the past year.

In this way, health -care organizations can target affected populations more effectively. Research suggests tobacco use facilitates a wide variety of adverse medical conditions. CHNA survey data show 87% of respondents do not smoke (Figure 41) and 96% of respondents do not vape (Figure 42). Only 4% smoke more than 12 times per day.

Social Determinants Related to Smoking or Vaping Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with smoking or vaping. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Smoking tends to be rated higher by those with less education and a lower income and those in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Vaping tends to be rated higher by younger people, those with less education and those with a lower income. 3.2 Drug and Alcohol Abuse Importance of the measure: Alcohol and drugs impair decision -making, often leading to adverse consequences and outcomes. Research suggests that alcohol is a gateway drug for youth, leading to increased usage of controlled substances in adult years. Accordingly, the substance abuse values and behaviors of high school students is a leading indicator of adult substance abuse in later years. Youth Substance Abuse Data from the 2020 Illinois Youth Survey measures illegal substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs - mainly marijuana) among adolescents. LaSalle County data reported for 2020, State of Illinois 96% 2% 2% 0% 0%Frequency of Vaping LaSalle County 2022 None 1 to 4 times per day 5 to 8 times per day 9 to 12 times per day More than 12 times per day CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 47 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 reporting 2018 data.

Use of illegal substances tends to be rated lower by White people. 3.3 Overweight and Obesity Importance of the measure: Individuals who are overweight and obese place greater stress on their internal organs, thus increasing the propensity to utilize health services. Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Illinois, and within LaSalle County. The US Surgeon General has characterized obesity as \"the fastest- growing, most threatening disease in America today.\" According to the Obesity Prevention Initiative from the Illinois General Assembly, 20% of Illinois children are obese. The financial burden of overweight and obese individuals is staggering, as the estimated annual medical costs attributed to obesity in Illinois for 1998 -2000 exceeded $3.4 billion, ranking Illinois 6th in the nation for obesity -attributed medical costs. With children, research has linked obesity to numerous chronic diseases including Type II diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure, and asthma. Adverse physical health side effects of obesity include orthopedic problems due to weakened joints and lower bone density. Detrimental mental health side effects include low self -esteem, poor body image, symptoms of depression and s uicide ideation. Obesity impacts educational performance as well; studies suggest school absenteeism of obese children is six times higher than that of non- obese children. With adults, obesity has far -reaching consequences. Testimony to the Illinois General Assembly indicated that obesity -related illnesses contribute to worker absenteeism, slow workflow, and high worker compensation rates. A Duke University study on the effects of obesity in the workforce noted 13 times more missed workdays by obese empl oyees than non- obese employees. Nationwide, lack of physical activity and poor nutrition contribute to an estimated 300,000 preventable deaths per year. In LaSalle County, the number of people diagnosed with obesity and being overweight has increased over the years from 2010- 2014 to 2015- 2019. Note specifically that the percentage of obese and overweight people has increased from 68.5% to 70.4%. Overweight and obesity rates in Illinois have increased over the years from 2010 -2014 to 2015- 2019. Note speci fically that the percentage of obese and overweight people has increased from 63.7% to 65.7%. Note that data have not been updated by the Illinois Department of Public Health. Additionally, note in the 2019 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that being ov erweight was their most prevalently diagnosed health condition.

Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions and do not reflect outpatient treatments and procedures. 4.1 Self -Identified Health Conditions Survey respondents were asked to self -identify any health conditions. Note that being overweight (29%) was significantly higher than any other health conditions. This percentage is significantly lower than secondary sources. Specifically, BRFSS data indicate that roughly two -thirds of the population is overweight or obese (Figure 53). CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 55 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 53 Source: CHNA Survey 4.2 Healthy Babies Importance of the measure: Regular prenatal care is a vital aspect in producing healthy babies and children. Screening and treatment for medical conditions as well as identification and interventions for behavioral risk factors associated with poor birth outcomes are impor tant aspects of healthy babies. Research suggests that women who receive adequate prenatal care are more likely to have better birth outcomes, such as full term and normal weight babies. Low Birth Weight Rates Low birth weight rate is defined as the per centage of infants born below 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds. Very low birth weight rate is defined as the percentage of infants born below 1,500 grams or 3.3 pounds. In contrast, the average newborn weighs about 7 pounds. The percentage of babies born with l ow birth weight in LaSalle County stayed consistent at 7% Overweight Allergy Mental health Asthma/COPD Heart Diabetes Memory Cancer Stroke CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 56 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 54 Source: County Health Rankings 4.3 Cardiovascular Disease Importance of the measure: Cardiovascular disease is defined as all diseases of the heart and blood vessels, including ischemic (also known as coronary) heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, hypertensive disease and atherosclerosis. Coronary Atheroscle rosis Coronary Atherosclerosis, sometimes -called hardening of the arteries, can slowly narrow and harden the arteries throughout the body. When atherosclerosis affects the arteries of the heart, it is called coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death for Americans. Most of these deaths are from heart attacks caused by sudden blood clots in the heart's arteries. The number of cases of coronary atherosclerosis complication at LaSalle County area hospitals decreased from 2018 to 2020. This change is likely due to the COVID -19 pandemic (Figure 55).

These conditions are characterized by breathlessness, wheezing, chronic coughing, frequent respiratory infections and chest tightness. Many respiratory conditions can be successfully cont rolled with medical supervision and treatment. However, children and adults who do not have access to adequate medical care are likely to experience repeated serious episodes, trips to the emergency room and absences from school and work. Hospitalization rates illustrate the worst episodes of respiratory diseases and are a proxy measure for inadequate treatment. Asthma The percentage of residents who have been diagnosed with asthma increased in LaSalle County has decreased between 2010 -2014 and 2015- 2019, while State averages also decreased. According to the Illinois BRFSS, asthma rates in LaSalle County (5.9%) are lower than the State of Illinois (8.2%) (Figure 60).

Figure 62 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health - Cancer in Illinois 4.6 Diabetes Importance of the measure: Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult blindness and amputations and is a leading contributor to strokes and heart attacks. It is estimated that 90 -95% of individu als with diabetes have Type II diabetes (previously known as adult- onset diabetes). Only 5 -10% of individuals with diabetes have Type I diabetes (previously known as juvenile diabetes). Inpatient cases of Type II diabetes from LaSalle County increased b etween 2018 (80 cases) and 2020 (97 cases) (Figure 63).

It would be highly cost -effective for both individuals and society if more programs focused on prevention rather than treatment of infectious diseases. Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Cases The data for the number of infections of chlamydia in LaSalle County from 2018 -2019 indicate an increase. There is also an increase of incid ence of chlamydia across the State of Illinois. (Figure 66). Rates of chlamydia in LaSalle County are lower than State averages.

These injuries are often indicative of serious mental health problems requiring the treatment of other trauma- inducing issues. Unintentional injuries can occur, in part, from violent crimes. 2 Source: http://www.idph.state.il.us/about/vpcd.htm CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 67 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Suicid e The number of suicide deaths in LaSalle County indicate higher incidence than State of Illinois averages, as there were approximately 17.5 per 100,000 people in LaSalle County in 2018 (Figure 68). Figure 68 Source: Illinois Department of Public Heal th Violent Crimes Violent crimes are defined as offenses that involve face- to-face confrontation between the victim and the perpetrator, including homicide, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

To accomplish this, community perceptions of health issues, unhealthy behaviors and issues related to well -being were first considered. Key takeaways from each chapter were then used to identify important health -related issues in the community. Next, a comprehensive inventory of community resources was completed; and finally, the most significant health needs in the community are prioritized. Specific criteria used to identify these issues included: (1) magnitude in the community; (2) severity in the community; (3) potential for impact to the community. 5.1 Perceptions of Health Issues The CHNA survey asked respondents to rate the three most important health issues in the community. Respondents had a choice of 11 different options. The health issue that rated highest was mental health (22%), followed by obesity (17%). The two factors were significantly higher than other categories based on t- tests between sample means). Note that perceptions of the community were accurate in some cases. For example, mental health issues are significantly increasing. Also, there is a steady rise in obesity. The survey respondents accurately identified these as important health issues. However, some perceptions were inaccurate. For example, while heart disease is a leading cause of mortality, it is ranked relatively low ( Figure 70). Note that perceptions of the community were accurate in some cases. For example, mental health issues are significantly increasing. Also, there is a steady rise in obesity. The survey respondents accurately identified these as important health issues. However, some perceptions were inaccurate. For example, while heart disease is a leading cause of mortality, it is ranked relatively low. CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 71 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 70 Source: CHNA Survey 5.2 Perceptions of Unhealthy Behaviors Respondents were asked to select the three most important unhealthy behaviors in the community out of a total of 10 choices. The two unhealthy behaviors that rated highest were drug abuse (illegal) at 22% and alcohol abuse at 20% (Figure 71). These two factors were significantly higher than other categories based on t-tests between sample means.

The issue impacting well -being that rated highest was access to healthcare (20%). It was followed by healthy food choices (17%) (Figure 72). Figure 72 Source: CHNA Survey 5.4 Summary of Community Health Issues Based on findings from the previous analyses, a chapter -by-chapter summary of key takeaways is used to provide a foundation for identification of the most important health -related issues in the community. Considerations for identif ying key takeaways include magnitude in the community, strategic importance to the community, existing community resources and potential for impact and trends and future forecasts. Demographics (Chapter 1) - Four factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the demographic analyses: Population decreased Population over age 65 increased Increasing LatinX population Single female head -of-house -household Prevention Behaviors (Chapter 2) - Five factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on prevention behaviors: 2%4%5%7%7%8%8%10%11%17%20%Perceptions of Issues that Impact Well Being LaSalle County 2022 Access to Healthcare Healthy Food Choices Less Hatred Job Opportunities Less Poverty Affordable Clean Housing Safer Neighborhoods Available Child Care Less Violence Public Transportation Better School Attendance CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 73 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Access to healthcare COVID -19 vaccination rates Prostate screening is very low Exercise and healthy eating behaviors Depression and stress/anxiety Symptoms and Predictors (Chapter 3) - Three factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on symptoms and predictors: Substance abuse among youth Overweight and obesity Heart disease Morbidity and Mortality (Chapter 4) - Three factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on morbidity/mortality behaviors: Cancer - lung Violent crime Suicide Potential Health -Related Needs Considered for Prioritizati on Before the prioritization of significant community health -related needs was performed, results were aggregated into 9 potential categories. Based on similarities and duplication, the 9 potential areas considered are: Aging issues Healthy behaviors - nutrition & exercise Behavioral health Overweight/Obesity Substance abuse Prostate screening Cancer - prostate Cancer - lung COVID -19 5.5 Community Resources After summarizing potential categories for prioritization in the Community Health Needs Assessment, a comprehensive analysis of existing community resources was performed to identify the efficacy to which these 9 health -related areas were being addressed. A resource matrix can be seen in APPENDIX 5: RESOURCE MATRIX relating to th e 9 health -related issues. CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 74 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 There are numerous forms of resources in the community. They are categorized as recreational facilities, county health departments, community agencies and area hospitals/clinics. A detailed list of community resources and descr iptions appears in APPENDIX 6: DESCRIPTION OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES. 5.6 Significant Needs Identified and Prioritized In order to prioritize the previously identified dimensions, the collaborative team considered health needs based on: (1) magnitude of the issues (e.g., what percentage of the population was impacted by the issue); (2) severity of the issues in terms of their relationship with morbidities and mortalities; (3) potential impact through collaboration. Using a modified version of the Hanlon Method (as seen in APPENDIX 7: PRIORITIZATION METHODOLOGY), the collaborative team identified three significant health needs and considered them equal priorities: Healthy Behaviors - defined as active living and healthy eating, and their impact on obesity Behavioral Health - including mental health and substance abuse Healthy Aging HEALTHY BEHAVIORS - ACTIVE LIVING, HEALTHY EATING AND SUBSEQUENT OBESITY ACTIVE LIVING. A healthy lifestyle, comprised of regular physical activity and balanced diet, has been shown to increase physical, mental and emotional well -being. Note that 22% of respondents indicated that they do not exercise at all, while the majority (64%) of residents exercise 1 -5 times per week. The most common reasons for not exercising are no t having enough energy (29%), not time (22%) or a dislike of exercise (16%). HEALTHY EATING. Almost two- thirds (64%) of residents report no consumption or low consumption (1 - 2 servings per day) of fruits and vegetables per day. Note that the percentage of residents who consume five or more servings per day is only 4%. The most prevalent reasons for failing to eat more fruits and vegetables were the lack of desire and lack of importance. OBESITY. In LaSalle County, over two -thirds (70.4%) of residents were diagnosed with obesity and being overweight. In the 2022 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that being overweight was the second most important health issue and was rated as the most prevalently diagnosed health condition. Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Illinois, and within LaSalle County. The U.S. Surgeon General has characterized obesity as \"the fastest- growing, most threatening disease in America today.\" According to the Obesity Prevention Initiative from the Illinois General Assembly, 20% of Illinois children are obese. With children, research has linked obesity to numerous chronic diseases including Type II diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure and asthma. Adverse physical health side effects of obesity include orthopedic problems due to weakened joints and lower bone density. Detrimental mental health side effects include low self -esteem, poor body image, symptoms of depression and suicide ideation. Obesity impacts educational performance as well; studies suggest school absenteeism of obese children is six times higher than that of non- obese children. With adults, obesity has far -reaching consequences. Testimony to the Illinois General Assembly indicated that obesity -related illnesses contribute to worker absenteeism, slow workflow, and high worker CHNA 2022 | LaSalle County 75 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 compensation rates. A Duke University study on the effects of obesity in the workforce noted 13 times more missed workdays by obese employees than non- obese employees. Natio nwide, lack of physical activity and poor nutrition contribute to an estimated 300,000 preventable deaths per year. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH - MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH. The CHNA survey asked respondents to indicate prevalence of specific issues, namely depression and stress/anxiety. Of respondents, 49% indicated they felt depressed in the last 30 days and 44% indicated they felt anxious or stressed. Depression tends to be rated higher by women, younger people, those with less income and those with less education. Similarly, stress and anxiety tend to be rated higher by women, younger people, those with less income and those with less education. Respondents were also asked if they spoke with anyone about their mental health in the last year. Of respondents 31% indicated that they spoke to someone, the most common response was to a counselor (38%). In regard to self -assessment of overall mental health, 14% of respondents stated they have poor overall mental health. In the 2022 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that mental health was the most important health issue. SUBSTANCE ABUSE. Of survey respondents, 20% indicated they consume at least one alcoholic drink each day. Alc ohol consumption tends to be rated higher by men, White people, and those with higher income. Of survey respondents, 6% indicated they improperly use prescription medications each day to feel better and 7% indicated the use marijuana each day. Note that misuse of prescription medication (oftentimes opioid use) tends to be rated higher by Black people, those with lower education, and those with less income. Marijuana use tends to be rated higher by Black people, those with lower education, and those with les s income. Finally, of survey respondents, 1% indicated they use illegal drugs on a daily basis. In the 2022 CHNA survey, respondents rated drug abuse (illegal) as the most prevalent unhealthy behavior (22%) in LaSalle County, followed by alcohol abuse (20 %). HEALTHY AGING In the CHNA survey, respondents rated aging issues (12%) as the fourth most important health issue. The percentage of individuals aged 65 and older increased 10.2% between 2015 and 2019. Alzheimer's disease was the 5th leading cause of d eath in LaSalle County in 2020. Illinois is projected to see an 18.2% increase in Alzheimer's disease incidence between 2018 and 2025. Alzheimer's and dementia care in the U.S. will cost an estimated $277 billion. According to a 2015 study, the average co st of dementia care (over a five -year period) was $287,038, compared to $175,136 (heart disease) and $173,383 (cancer).
