It is then also less likely to affect the relationship between you and your baby. There are many health professionals who are familiar with these issues and who can provide you with support in several different ways. These may include your GP, midwife, counsellor or complementary practitioner. Research suggests that the treatment most women prefer for perinatal depression or anxiety is a combination of practical support and advice, talk therapies and support groups. If necessary, antidepressants may be helpful. Counselling and talking therapies There are a range of talking treatments that have been shown to work for all types of depression and anxiety. Cognitive behaviour therapy is one of the most well known. Talking therapies are provided through face-to-face, phone, group or online programmes.
