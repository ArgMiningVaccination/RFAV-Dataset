Health, serve together in the spirit of the gospel as a compassionate and transforming healing presence within our communities. Founded in community -based legacies of compassionate healing, we provide the highest quality comprehensive continuum of integrated health care, supportive housing and community services, especially for the needy and vulnerable. The School of Nursing Mission The mission of the Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing is to prepare students for entry into the profession of nursing as competent, caring practitioners. History The Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing was founded in 1898, only 25 years after the establishment of the nation's first nursing school. In 1902, the School of Nursing graduated its first class of 10 students. To date, more than 2,500 students have graduated. The school was chartered in 1903 by the State University of New York to \"instruct for the successful practice of nursing\". Today, over a century later, the mission and philosophy of the school and faculty continue to reflect the intent of the original charter while progressively advancing program offerings to meet the unprecedented demands in the profession. Quality education for students has always been the school's primary focus. In 1989, the Samaritan Hospital Board of Directors received authority to grant a two -year associa te in science degree for the registered nurse program. In January 1995, the school expanded its offering w ith the addition of the practical nursing (LPN) certificate program. The Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing is registered by the New York State Education Department. The curricul a for the nursing program s adhere to the National League for Nursing's educational outcomes for nursing programs 1. 1 National League for Nursing. (2010). Outcomes and competencies for graduates of practical/vocational, diploma, associate degree, baccalaureate, master's, practice doctorate, and research doctorate programs in nursi ng. New York, NY: The National League for Nursing . 6 Samaritan Hospital is certified by the New York State Department of Health. PHILOSOPHY WE BELIEVE The practice of nursing is... An art and science Dedicated to promoting, maintaining, restoring and supporting health and well - being of individuals living and dying Holistic Caring Accountable: legally, ethically and morally The application of theoretical knowledge, reasoning, and technical competence Accepting and respecting individuals regardless of religion, race, creed, color, age, gender, culture, ability, mental status, or socioeconomic status, or political affiliation Partnership with: o Individuals and significant others with actual or potential health needs and o Health care team members Education... Is a partnership involving shared accountability between faculty and students. Requires open, honest and timely communication by faculty and students. Recognizes students' unique abilities, life experiences, and learning preferences. Is committed to providing a variety of resources and active learning experiences to support individual learning preferences and rates. Builds from simple to complex. A minimum level of competency is critical before progressing in a sequential curriculum. Given additional time and resources, students establish a stronger foundation from which to build. In consultation with faculty, students identify corrective measures necessary to move to a higher level of competence and negotiate the time needed. Flourishes in an environment in which there is freedom of expression, creativity, and innovation. Is a lifelong endeavor. DEFINITION OF SCHOLARSHIP The faculty of the School of Nursing have defined scholarship as: \"Professional endeavors which advance the art & science of nursing and nursing education. \" 7 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK The nursing community of St. Peter's Health Partners has adopted Jean Watson's human caring theory as our theoretical framework. As a member of this community, the School subscribes to this theory. Watson's Refined Carative Processes1 include: Practic e equanimity with self/other Being authentically present; enabling belief system and subjective world of self/other Cultivating own spiritual practices; beyond ego -self to authentic transpersonal presence Sustaining a loving, trusting, and caring relationship Allowing for the expression of feelings' authentically listening and \"holding another person's story for them\" Creative solution seeking through caring processes, full use of self; all ways of knowing/doing/being; engage in artistry of human caring -healing practices and modalities Authentic teaching -learning within context of caring relationship; stay within other's frame of reference; shift toward health- healing -wellness coaching model. Creating healing environment at all levels; physical/nonphysical, subtle environment of energy, consciousness, wholeness, beauty, dignity, and peace are potentiated Reverentially and respectfully assisting with basic needs, holding an intentional, caring consciousness of touching the embodied spirit of another as sacred practice, working with life force/life energy/life mystery of another Opening and attending to spiritual, mysterious, unknown, and existential dimensions of all the vicissitudes of life, death, suffering, pain, joy, tr ansitions life change; \"allowing for a miracle\" All of this is presupposed by a knowledge base and clinical competence Furthermore, the theoretical framework is informed by our understanding of the work of Patricia Benner. Benner theorized that nurses m ust have a strong foundation of knowledge and develop expertise through repeated practice and breadth of experience. It is our intent that students attain a sound theoretical basis and have ample opportunity to develop competence in nursing practice suffi cient to prepare them for entry into practice. Finally, all faculty members are encouraged to reflect on the work of many nursing theorists and are supported in their incorporation of relevant components of these theori es 8 OVERVIEW of PRACTICAL NURSE PROGRAM CURRICULUM GOALS The curriculum is prepared by the faculty with the following goals in mind: Graduate a caring, accountable nurse, adaptable to a variety of settings and changing environments.

The form and supporting documentation is submitted to the Dean . B. Any student requesting accommodations must provide recent documentation concerning his or her disability. Fo r those students entering immediately following graduation from high school, the documentation should be no more than three years old. For those who have been tested with adult scales, the documentation should be no more than five years old. C. In the ab sence of documentation, or in the instance of a newly identified disability, the Dean will use best judgment as to the provision of accommodations. D. The Dean will inform faculty of the accommodations to be made, but will not disclose confidential inform ation as to the nature of the disability. E. The D ean will work with faculty to arrange details of the accommodations (e.g. scheduling an adjunct faculty as a reader). F. Every course overview will contain the following statement: \"Students with disabi lities who wish to have special accommodations are expected to inform the faculty of any special needs in a timely manner. If the student has previously identified him or herself to the Dean, accommodations will be made as agreed upon between the student and the Dean. If this is a newly identified disability, plans for accommodation will be made on a case- by-case basis.\" G. Each course chair will review the above statement with students at the time of course orientation. It is the student's option to request accommodations. 28 ACADEMIC INFORMATION PROGRESSION Nursing courses build from simple to complex and are taken in order. Prerequisite courses must be completed prior to the next nursing course in the sequence as described in the program of studies. A student may not withdraw from a co- requisite course while maintaining enrollment in the nursing course. Current registration in the nursing course MUST be accompanied by current registration in all co- requisite courses, unless those courses have alrea dy been successfully completed in a prior semester. If a student is enrolled in a nursing class and chooses to withdraw from a required co- requisite course for that nursing class, the student must also withdraw from the nursing class. GRADING An accepted minimum level of competency is required for progression in the program of studies and has been defined as a grade of C or better in the support courses and B or better in the nursing courses. Midterm grade reports are generated for each student. Student s who are experiencing academic difficulty are encouraged to meet with their academic advisors to formulate a plan for successful completion. GRADING SCALE Grading Scale for Nursing Courses Letter Grade Description Grade Points Excellent A 90-100% 4.0 Very Good B+ 85-89% Unsatisfactory D 60-64% 1.0 F failure I incomplete W withdrawal on or before the last date to withdraw ** Z failure due to absence without withdrawal * Any grade below a B is equivalent to course failure. Stude nts who earn less than a B are not eligible to progress to the next n ursing course. **The last date to withdraw from a course is published each semester. Please note, the last day to withdraw fro m a n ursing course may differ from the last day to withdraw from an HVCC course. 29 ACADEMIC INFORMATION Hudson Valley Community College Grading Scale GRADES NUMERICAL EQUIVALENT QUALITY POINTS PER CREDIT HOUR A Excellent 90 - 100 4.0 B Very Good 80-89 3.0 C Average 70-79 2.0 D Passing 60-69 1.0 F Failure Below 60 0 I Incomplete IP Course in Progress P Pass S Satisfactory W Withdraw NGS No Grade Submitted Z Absent Without Withdrawal EXM Excused Medical (Physical Education courses only) HONOR ROLL Honor roll status is determined by a semester GPA of 3.75 or higher and is noted on the student's transcript. GRADUATE HONORS Graduates with a cumulative GPA of 3.75 -3.94 are listed in the graduation program as Magna Cum Laude. The honor also appears on the graduate's final transcript Graduates with a cumulative GPA of 3.9 5 or higher are listed in the graduation program as Summa Cum Laude. The honor also appears on the graduate's final transcript. 30 ACADEMIC INFORMATION ACADEMIC/ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES Listed below are excerpts taken from Academic Policy statements. Complete policy statements ar e available in the school's Main Office, in the Health Sciences Library , and on the MESA portal . ACADEMIC PROBATION A student is placed on academic probation when he/she: earns less than a B (C, D, F or Z) in any nursing course earns less than a C - (D, F or Z) in any support course withdraw s from a second nursing course (semester) or support course.* * If a student has previously withdrawn from any course, a withdrawal from a subsequent course in that same category will at least result in academic probat ion or may result in academic dismissal, if the student has previously failed or withdrawn from any course in that same category . Course categories are: Nursing courses Science courses: Anatomy & Physiology I & II, Microbiology Non-science support courses : General Psychology, Developmental Psychology, English Composition I, a social science course, an English elective, and the directed elective. PROCEDURE AFTER NURSING COURSE FAILURE The student who failed must submit a Request to Repeat a Nursing Course Form , along with a letter requesting permission to repeat the course. The letter should explain what the student believes was the reason for the failure, and if permitted to return, what the student would do differently to ensure success. The A&P committ ee will render a decision. The committee's decision is final and will be communicated in writing. If permitted to repeat, the student must repeat the course in its entirety, both the theory and clinical portions of the course. The repeating student wi ll be placed on academic probation until successful completion of the course. If the repeating student is unsuccessful in a second attempt, the student will be academically dismissed. If the repeating student is successful he/she will be listed as in good standing academically. Failure of a subsequent nursing course or semester will result in academic dismissal. 31 ACADEMIC INFORMATION ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student may only attempt any given course twice. After two unsuccessful attempts at the same course, the student will be dismissed. A grade of less than B is considered to be failure of a nursing course . A grade of less than C is considered to be failure of a non -nursing course. A student who is not approved to repeat a failed nursing course is academically dismissed. Failure of a second course in any nursing, science or non- science support course category will result in academic dismissal . See examples below: 1. If a student fails A&P I and subsequently fails Micro, then he/she will be dismissed. 2. If a student fails PSY 100 and then fails the English elective, he or she will be dismissed . 3. If a student fails NSG 1 and subsequently fails NSG V, then he/she will be dismissed. Dismissal will result for those students who have failed a nursing course at any other school of nursing, including our sister school, if they fail ONE nursing course at this school. Dismissed students are not eligible for readmission. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL WAIVER An academic dismissal waiver will be considered if personal circumstances, unexpected crisis , or hardship is encountered by the student leading to the failure. The faculty advisor or student services representative MUST have been informed of these circumstances prior to the end of the course. WITHDRAWAL Withdrawal is designed for students who are unable to continue with a course(s) in any given semester. Students may withdraw from one course or course category only once without penalty. A subsequent withdrawal will at least result in Academic Probation and may result in dismissal. A third withdrawal will result in dismissal . Each semester a last date for wi thdrawal without penalty is published. The nursing course withdrawal deadline wil l be different from the HVCC withdrawal deadline. If a student withdraws on or before the \"last day to withdraw\" date published by the School of Nursing, the student will rec eive a W. The effective date of the withdrawal will be the date the form is submitted to Student Services with all required signatures. Withdrawals will not be allowed after the published withdrawal deadline.32 Please refer to Refund Schedule for the financial consequences of withdrawing from a course. It is also best practice to speak with the Financial Aid Coordinator. WITHDRAWAL FROM NURSING COURSES Students who wish to withdraw from a nursing course must meet with the Dean of Student Services, the Bursar, and the Financial Aid Coordinator and complete a nursing course withdrawal form. It is also recommended that the student discuss withdrawal with his/her academic advisor. Students who wish to withdraw from a course or courses, at the beginning of the semester, must withdraw from the nursing course and may withdraw from the co- requisite course(s). Students who wish to withdraw from a course or courses, at the end of the semester, may be permitted to continue in the nursing course and withdraw from the co- requisite course(s). In this instance, the decision will be made by the Dean on a case -by-case basis. The effective date of the withdrawal will be the date the form is submitted to Student Servic es with all required signatures. WITHDRAWAL FROM HUDSON VALLEY COURSES Withdrawal policies of Hudson Valley Community College are applied to courses taken at that school. Please review the Hudson Valley Community College Catalog regarding their Grading Policy and other implications of withdrawing from a course. Students must refer to the Hudson Valley Community College catalogue and calendar each semester for specific information regarding policies on registration, registration changes, tuition and grading. Students must complete a HVCC withdrawal form available from the Student Services Coordinator. The form must be completed and signed by the Director of Student Services and the student must take the form directly to the Registrar's Office at HVCC in order for the change to go into effect. PLEASE NOTE: All withdrawals from HVCC courses MUST be approved by Student Services at Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing . INCOMPLETE GRADE At the completion of a nursing course, a student may be granted an \"incomplete\" letter grade when course requirements have not been met and a learning plan has been established and agreed upon with course faculty. The \"incomplete\" letter grade must be redeemed within TWO WEEKS following the end of the semester or the grade converts to an F. In exceptional circumstances, the student may apply for an extension through the Dean. Incomplete grades in support courses are subject to the policy of Hudson Valley Community College or the institution at which the support course is taken. 33 ACADEMIC INFORMATION LEAVE OF ABSENCE (LOA): The LOA policy allows students to interrupt continuous enrollment for not more than one semester without having to re -apply for enrollment and without changing conditions of their academic program. The leave of absence policy covers both involuntary and voluntary interruptions (personal, financial, medical, military) and is meant to ensure program completion within a 3 year time period Exceptions to the time limit may be granted by the Dean of the School or Dean of Student Services under extenuating circumstances. Students who wish to obtain a LOA must complete a LOA form with Student Services. Student Services notifies the Bursar and the Financial Aid Coordinator. Students will be contacted to register by Student Services during the advisement period of the semester prior to their re- enrollment. REPEATING A NURSING COURSE AT OUR SISTER SCHOOL Students who have failed a nursing course and who have been approved to repeat a nursing course in our school may be required to do so at the campus of Memorial College of Nursing. The decision of where the student repeats the course rests solely with the school administration. All relevant policies from Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing will apply to a course taken at Memorial College of Nursing. The student who repeats a nursing course at Memorial College of Nursing will continue to be a student at Samaritan Hospit al School of Nursing. Failure of a subsequent nursing semester will result in academic dismissal, whether the repeated course is taken at Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing or at Memorial College of Nursing. The student's transcript will show the cours e taken at the host school, with the actual grade record ed and computed into the student's GPA. ACADEMIC RECORD Students receive a grade report at the end of each semester. The Grade Point Average (GPA) is obtained by adding the quality points achieved by the student in each course and dividing the sum by the total number of credit hours for those courses. If a failed course is repeated, the original grade will always appear on the transcript. The new grade will be used to calculate the GPA, and will be shown as repeated. Any non- nursing grades below a C - are not accepted for transfer credit and do not earn whatever quality points are awarded by Hudson Valley Community College. Transferred courses are not assigned quality points and are not calculated in cumulative averages. 34 ACADEMIC INFORMATION MASTERY LEARNING This is a process designed to assist students in attaining the highest level of competency by recognizing learning s tyle preferences and variations in time to acquire a deeper understanding. The curriculum builds from simple to complex. To support a stronger foundation, all students are required to attain a minimum of 80% or better in all nursing courses. If a student does not meet the minimum standard on a nursing exam, he/she must complete corrective measures, as discussed with that student's faculty. ATTENDANCE Scheduled learning experiences are designed to enhance each student's success and support deeper understanding. Attendance at classroom/lecture is strongly encouraged. Attendance at all clinical, lab and observational learning experiences is required. Students are responsible for reporting late arrival or any planned or unplanned absence. Students are required to notify the clinical site and the clinical instructor when they will be late or absent. Additional information about notification of absences will be provided in each individual course orientation by the course chair. (See Attendance Policy) When a student is absent for three or more days as a result of an extended illness or has undergone childbirth or surgery of any kind, a written release from the student's health care provider or Em ployee Health must be provided to indicate the student's readiness to return to scheduled classroom and/or clinical experiences. Excessive absences or multiple failures to report absences or lateness may result in course failure and/or termination from t he program (see Dismissal Policy). Students at risk will be advised accordingly and informed in writing of actions that may be taken. CLINICAL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES In addition to course work at the School of Nursing, students will be assigned to clinical learning experiences at other health care agencies in the Capital District. These agencies may include, but are not limited to the following: Samaritan Hospital, The Eddy Cohoes Rehabilitation Center, St. Peter's Hospital, St. Margaret's Ho spital , Heritage House, or other agencies. These assignments will be scheduled during day and/or evening hours on weekdays and/or weekends. PREPAREDNESS FOR CLINICAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES Students are responsible for coming to clinical learning experiences prepared to participate in those experiences. Inadequate preparation may result in a faculty member denying an unprepared student the opportunity to participate in the learning experienc e (dismissed from the clinical setting for that day). Missed clinical learning experiences must be made up. ACADEMIC INFORMATION 35 EVALUATION OF CLINICAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES Data or information used to formulate the student's clinical evaluation may incl ude, and may not be limited to, the following sources: direct observations by the student's clinical faculty, patient statements, the student's written care plans and assignments, the student's demonstration/performance of psychomotor skills, the student's ability to discuss human illness or conditions, the student's ability to plan and provide organized, safe, efficient nursing care for same, the student's ability to provide patient teaching, the student's participation in clinical conferences, review of t he student's documentation in the medical record, the student's professional behavior and appearance, and statements from other members of the health care team and preceptors' (if any) evaluations, School of Nursing administration and faculty and/or member s of the heath care team. CLINICAL LEARNING M AKE-UP Missed clinical learning experiences must be made up. Make- ups will be scheduled at the convenience of the faculty, but are not guaranteed. Students who miss more than one clinical experience will be required to make up the clinical experience at the end of the semester after the final exam. In that case, s tudents will be assessed additional fees to augment expenses related to make up experiences beyond routine scheduling or semester calendars. The f ees will be billed by the Bursar and payment must be made within 10 business days. Due to the uniqueness of some learning experiences, certain clinical make -ups may not be possible. After an absence, arrangements for make- ups of any type of missed experiences should be done in a timely manner with the faculty. Excessive absence or lateness may result in an administrative termination from the program and/or may be reason for course failure. Some clinical experiences begin at 6:30 or 7:00 a.m., or during e vening hours or on weekends. If a clinical learning experience is cancelled, it may be rescheduled at a later date. 36 ACADEMIC INFORMATION GENERAL CRITERIA FOR MEETING OUTCOMES IN THE CLINICAL PORTION OF A NURSING COURSE A student who successfully meets outcomes...

We strive to provide students with the knowledge, skills, judgment, and wisdom they need to function in society as educated adults. By accep ting admission into the School of Nursing, the student affirms the commitment to uphold the values of the School's Honor Code and the standards of the nursing profession. Academic integrity at the Schools of Nursing and SPHP is based on a respect for individual achievement that lies at the heart of academic culture. Every faculty member and student belongs to a community of professionals where academic integrity is a fundamental commitment. DEFINITIONS Academic Integrity is defin ed in terms of a commitment to five fundamental values and to the principles that flow from those values. At the School of Nursing, five values are fundamental to the academic process: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. Academic integr ity is the commitment to stand up for these five values, even in the face of adversity. Academic Dishonesty is defined as any action or practice that provides the potential for an unfair advantage to one individual or one group. Academic dishonesty inc ludes misrepresenting facts, fabricating or doctoring data or results, representing another's work or knowledge as one's own, disrupting or destroying the work of others, or abetting anyone who engages in such practices. Academic dishonesty is not absolute because the expectations for collaboration vary. In some courses, for example, students are assigned to work on team projects. In others, students are given permission to collaborate on homework projects or to have written materials present during an examination. Unless otherwise specified, however, the School of Nursing requires all work to be the result of individual effort, performed without the help of other individuals or outside sources. If a question arises about the use of external materials that may be used or the amount of collaboration that is permitted for a given task, each individual involved is responsible for verifying the rules with the appropriate faculty before engaging in collaborative activities, using external materials or accept ing help from others. 40 Actions constituting violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to, the following: Plagiarism : The use of another's work, ideas, data, or product without appropriate acknowledgment, such as copying another's work, presenting someone else's opinions and theories as one's own, or working jointly on a project and then submitting it as one's own. Cheating: The use or attempted use of unauthorized materials, information, or study aids; or an act of deceit by whic h a student attempts to misrepresent academic skills or knowledge; unauthorized copying or collaboration. Fabrication: Intentional misrepresentation or invention of any information, such as falsifying research, inventing or exaggerating data, or listing incorrect or fictitious references. Collusion: Assisting another to commit an act of academic dishonesty, such as paying or bribing someone to acquire a test or assignment, taking a test or doing an assignment for someone else, or allowing someone to do these things for one's own benefit. Academic Misconduct : The intentional violation of school policies, such as tampering with grades, misrepresenting one's identity, or taking part in obtaining or distributing any part of a test or any information about the test. SANCTIONS All proven cases of academic dishonesty will be penalized as appropriate under the circumstances. Sanctions other than a reduced or failing grade may be imposed by the chair of the course. The imposition of any sanction other than a private reprimand will include a statement of reasons supporting its severity. A student may appeal any finding or sanction. Sanctions may include but are not limited to: Reduced or failing grade, on an assi gnment, test or course. A letter of reprimand A defined period of probation, with or without the attachment of conditions Withdrawal of School of Nursing funding A defined period of suspension, with or without the attachment of conditions Expulsion (or dis missal) from the School of Nursing Notation on the official record Revocation of an awarded degree Any combination of the sanctions above The administrators of the School of Nursing will be responsible for tracking any occurrences of academic dishonesty and meeting with any student who fails to follow the honor code. 41 PROGRAM DISMISSAL/TERMINATION A student may be dismissed from the school when there is sufficient evidence to show: violations of The School of Nursing code of honor (see Academic Integrity policy) violations of The School of Nursing Social Networking Policy (see Social Networking policy) academic failure (see Academic Progress and Grading policy)* unsafe clinical practice a failure to comply with School/Hospital/Agency policies and procedures excessive absences with failure to initiate a plan for make- up experiences, or absences beyond the school's ability to accommodate the make- up experiences behavior which is unprofessional/inappropriate conduct that jeopardizes the safety of self , students, patients or others failure to meet financial obligations or health requirements violation of the drug/alcohol policy behavior that violates one or more policies, such as Conduct on Campus or Sexual Harassment/Sexual Assault policies Faculty staff or students who recklessly or intentionally endanger the mental or physical health of others at the School of Nursing will be subject to corrective action up to and including termination or dismissal. Any communication (statement or photo) which may cause actual or potential harm or injury to another or to the School may be grounds for termination or dismissal. *If a student is unsuccessful in a nursing course due to mental or physical illness, a plan of treatment and written proof of completion, by an appropriate authority, must be submitted before the student will be considered for readmission. APPEALS STUDENT APPEAL PROCESS The Student Appeal Process is designed to facilitate conflict resolution. Students have a right to appeal decisions that impact their educational experiences or create conflict with their program objectives. Remedy is sought through the following steps: Solve the problem at the source. Meet with the individual or persons involved in the conflict to attempt to resolve issue(s). Take the problem to next level. When a conflict remains unresolved, seek assistance through an advisor, or curriculum team member. When all avenues have been exhausted, a written statement of appeal may be submitted to the Admission and Academic Progression Committee within eight (8) business days of the issue being disputed. 42 A student who is appealing a clinical failure which is determined prior to the end of the semester may not attend class, clinical or lab while the appeal is pending. A student who is appealing a dismissal may not attend class, clinical or lab while the appeal is pending. An ad-hoc subcommittee of the Admission and Academic Progress Committee will be convened, comprised of the Dean of Student Services or designee, two faculty representatives, and two students. Every attempt will be made to review the written appeal within five working days from the time the written appeal is received. The student will be invited to appear before the appeals committee to state his/her case. The faculty member of the course the student was unsuccessful in will also be invited to present any information to support the grade being appealed. The committee will vote to either uphold the grade, or reverse it. The appeals process does not guarantee that a decision will be reversed. It does ensure that issues brought before the committee are mediated and that all considerations on behalf of the student are given. The purpose of the appeals committee is to formulate resolutions and make recommendations to the Dean. The Dean may uphold the decision or override it. The decision of the Dean is final. If the Dean is the subject of the appeal, the final decision rests with the Admissions and Progression Committee. Please refer to Policy #203. No action will be taken against any student who chooses to file an appeal. Written assurance to this effect will be provided to any student who has filed an appeal. Any student who appeals a decision will be provided with written assurance that no acti on will be taken against a student for filing the complai nt. Section 494(C)j of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, provides that a student, faculty member, or any other person who believes he or she has been aggrieved by an institution of high er education has the right to file a written complaint. In New York State, a complaint may be filed by any person with reason to believe that an institution has acted contrary to its published standards or that conditions at the institution appear to jeopardize the quality of the institution's instructional programs or the general welfare of its students. Any person who believes he or she has been aggrieved by an institution on or after May 4, 1994, may file a written complaint within three years of the alleged incident. Information regarding this complaint process can be obtained in the Main Office of the School of Nursing. Additionally, the person can contact opprogs@nysed.gov and request a complaint form. The student must be the complainant. Additional information may be obtained at the following link: http://www.highered.nysed.gov/ocue/spr/COMPLAINTFORMINFO.html 43 CAMPUS SAFETY/SEC URITY PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the policy of the School of Nursing to take reasonable steps to provide a learning environment that is safe and free of threat or harm. In addition, the policies and procedures of the School of Nursing provide protection of the rights and dignity of each student and employee. A safe and healthy learning environment will assure that the student has the best possible opportunity for success in their studies. Safety and S ecurity is the responsibility of every student and employee. It is expected that each member of the School of Nursing community work to make our campus a safe and productive learning environment. PREVENTION Prevention is the best strategy for providing a safe environment. To that end, the School of Nursing has policies and procedures regarding safety and security issues and practices. These policies are covered in student orientations. Personal safety and v iolence prevention education is also provided to students annually. Published materials regarding personal safety and security and treatment options are available from the Student Services office. The School of Nursing is in compliance with all government regulations and recommendations. Annual fire and safety inspections of the facility are conducted. In the event of an imminent threat against the safety of the community, it is the policy of the School of Nursing to take reasonable steps to provide s tudents with warning of potential threats to security. COMPLAINT PROCEDURE The School of Nursing believes that the reporting of crime is an effective measure in preventing future crimes. Issues of safety or security should be brought to the attention of t he hospital's security office and the Dean . Students, faculty, staff, and guests are encouraged to report all crimes and public safety related incidents to the appropriate authorities in a timely manner. Crimes committed on campus should be reported to sec urity as well as the local police department. The complaint should include details of the incident(s), names of individuals involved, and the names of witnesses. Should an accident or incident involving yourself or another occur, please contact the Dean or a faculty or staff member for an incident report form, instructions for completing and filing the report, and possible referral for treatment. Sexual assault is a crime and victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the emergency department fo r medical and forensic evaluation. Sexual assault should also be reported to the D ean or campus security authority. Reports of sexual harassment or assault are confidential and should be reported to even if legal action is not being pursued. In addition to the School of Nursing's internal complaint procedure, students have the right to pursue investigation and prosecution of sexual harassment by filing complaints with the New York State Division of Human Rights (NYSDHR). Students must file complaints with in 365 days of the last incident. Whatever action is taken against the harasser will be communicated to the NYSDHR complainant. 44 CAMPUS SAFETY/SECURITY SPECIFIC POLICIES Bias Related Crime Prevention It is the policy of the School of Nursing to take reasonable steps to provide a learning environment free from bias. The learning environment should be one that is fair and that allows students to progress solely on the basis of ability and academic performance. Bias adversely affects the learning environment and the student's ability to learn. Bias perpetrated by the student faculty, or staff will not be tolerated. Allegations will be investigated promptly and with as much confidentiality as the situati on permits. It is also the policy of the School of Nursing to provide information about bias related crime to the incoming student during the mandatory orientation program. Bias includes provisions and coverage of the Hate Crimes Act of 2000 codified in ar ticle 485 in the Penal law. Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Assault Prevention It is the policy of the School of Nursing to take reasonable steps to provide a learning environment free of sexual harassment. The learning environment should be one that is fair and where students progress solely on the basis of their ability and academic performance. Sexual harassment adversely affects the academic environment and the student's ability to learn.

Annual statistics and reports on campus crime or criminal offenses affecting hospital employees, students or staff members are available through the hospital's security department and the student services office. The Advisory Committee on Campus Safety will provide an annual Safety R eport that includes all campus crime statistics as reported to the United States Department of Education. The United States Department of Education's web site for accessing campus crime statistics is http://ope.ed .gov/security 46 TITLE IX/NYS Article 129B:\"Enough is Enough\" Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 is a federal law that states: \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" The School also adheres to the NYS law Article 129B, \"Enough is Enough\". The School of Nursing has a duty to PROMPTLY address complaints of sex discrimination, including sexual harassment and sexual violence, limit the effects of the discrimination and prevent it's recurrence. Anyone who believes there has been an act of discrimination on the basis of sex against any person or group in the School of Nursing may file a complaint under Title IX. The Title IX C oordinator is the responsible employee with major responsibility for Title IX compliance efforts. The Title IX coordinator's responsibilities are critical to the development, implementation, and monitoring of meaningful efforts to comply with Title IX. The Title IX Coordinator at the Samaritan School of Nursing is Diana O'Brien. She can be reached at 518- 331-1160. When the Title IX Coordinator is not available, emergency access to the Hospital's Administrator -on-Call is available by calling the hospital operator at Samaritan Hospital: 518- 0524. A. Accused - a person accused of a violation who has not yet entered Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing's (SHSON) judicial or conduct process . B. Affirmative Consent - a know ing, voluntary, and mutual decision among all participants to engage in \"sexual activity\" (as defined below). Consent can be given by words or ac tions, as long as those words or actions create clear permission regarding willingness to engage in the sexual activity. Silence or lack of resistance, in and of itself, does not demonstrate consent. The definition of consent does not vary based upon a participant's sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Conse nt to any sexual activity between or with any party does not necessarily constitute consent to any other sexual act. o Whether through words or actions that clearly displays consent, each party must affirmatively conse nt to participating in each sexual activity. Consent ing to one type of sexual activity is not blanket consent to any and all types of sexual activity. Consent is required regardless of whether the person initiating the act is under the influence of drugs and/or alcoho l. Conse nt may be initially given but withdrawn at any time. Consent cannot be given when a person is incapac itated, which occu rs when 47 an individual lacks the ability to know ingly choo se to participate in sexual activity. Incapacitation may be caused by the lack of consciousness or being asleep, being involuntarily restrained, being under the age of consent, or if an individual otherwise cannot consent. o Minors who cannot consent under New York's laws covering age of consent are considered incapacitated. Under New York law, the age of consent is 17 years old. Student s and employees are encouraged to review New York State Penal Law Article 130 for additional details regarding New York's age of consent. o Dependi ng on the degr ee of intoxication, someone who is under the influence of al coho l, drugs, or other intoxicants may be incapacitated and therefore unable to consen t. This does not mean that individuals cannot affirmatively consent to sexual activity or con tact when they have been drinking or using drugs, howeve r. Such individuals may still affirmatively consent through words or actions that clearly indicate interest in engaging in the activity. o Incapacitation is to be determined by a student conduct or investigation process based on available evidence, acknowledging that in almost no cases will scientific evidence of alcohol or drug level (such as a breathalyzer taken at the time of the assault) be available. There is no single standar d or number of drinks that leads to incapacitation. This level varies for different people, and may depend in part on their age, gender , height, weight, metabolism and whether and how much they have recently eaten. Consent cannot be given when it is the result of any coercion, intimidation, force, or threat of harm. When consent is withdrawn or can no longer be given, sexual activity must stop. o Consent can \"no longer be given\" when a party to a sexual act or sexual contact initially conse nts to the activity, but during the course of the activity falls asleep or otherwise beco mes uncon scious or incapac itated. At that point, the other party must stop the sexual activity or contact. C. Bystander - a person who observes a crime, impending crime, conflict, potentially violent or violent behav ior, or conduct that is in violation of rules or policies of SHSON . A bystander is not a \"reporting individual\" (as defined below), even if the bystander brings forth a report. D. Confidentiality - may be offered by an individual who is not required by law to report known incidents of sexual assault or other crimes to institution officials, in a manner consi stent with state and federal law, including but not limited to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1092(f ) and 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 mental health counselors , medical p roviders and pastoral counselors are examples of SHSON or Samaritan Hospital employees who may offer confidentiality. The obligation to keep information in confidence is inherent for certain SHSON 48 professionals on campus, such as health care providers, licensed social workers, licensed psycho logists, and past oral and pr ofessional coun selors (including licensed mental health coun selors). Many off-campus resources such as rape crisis centers are also confidential, and with the except ion of certain child abuse and imminent threats, individuals working in such organizations have no obligation to report information back to the reporting individual's campus. It is import ant to note that all other SHSON employees who do not fall within the categories listed above are required to report known incidents of sexual assault or other crimes, so they are NOT confidential resources. Howeve r, even SHSON officers and employees who cannot guar antee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possi ble. The information you provide to a noncon fidential resource will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek a resolution. E. Crime of Violence - murder, manslaugh ter, rape, fondling, incest, statutory rape, robbe ry, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and arson, as defined below. o Criminal Homicide: Manslaught er by Negligence: The killing of another person through gross negligence. o Criminal Homicide: Murder and Nonnegl igent Manslaugh ter: The willful (nonnegl igent) killing of human being by another. o Rape: The pene tration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body par t or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. o Fondling : The touchi ng of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her age or becaus e of his/her tempor ary or permanent mental incapacity. o Incest: Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law. o Statutory Rape: Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent. Under New York law, the age of consent is 17 years old. See New York State Penal Law Article 130. o Robber y: The taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear. o Aggravated Assaul t: An unlawful attack by one person upon another for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury. This type of assault usually is accompanied by the use of a weapon or by means likely to produce death or great bodily harm. (It is not necessary that injury result from an aggr avated assault when a gun, knife, or other weapon is used which could and pr obab ly would result in serious personal injury if the crime were succe ssfully completed. 49 o Burglary: The unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or a theft. For reporting purposes this definition includes: unlawful entry with intent to commit a larceny or felony; breaking and entering with intent to commit a larceny; houseb reaking; safecracking; and all attempts to comm it any of the aforementioned. o Motor Vehicle Theft: The theft or attempted theft of a motor vehicle. o Arson: Any willful or malicious burning or attempt to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house, public building, motor vehicle or aircraft, personal property of another, etc. F. Nonconsensual Sexual Activity - occurs when \"sexual activity\" (as defined below) is perpetrated against a victim without his or her \"affirmative conse nt\" (as defined above ). G. Privacy - may be offered by an individual when such individual is unabl e to offer confidentiality under the law but shall still not disclose information learned from a reporting individual or bystander to a crime or incident more than necessary to comply with applicable laws, including informing appropriate SHSON officials. Although most SHSON employees are not confidential resources, they can still offer \"privacy.\" This means that an employee may have to share information pursuant to federal or state law or school policy with certain other SHSON employees, but they will not share the private information beyond what is required or needed to comply with law and policy, and will otherwise limit re- disclosure as much as possible. Privacy of the records specific to the investigation is maintained in accordance with New York State law and, with respect to student records, the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) statute. Any public release of information to comply with the timely warning provisions of the Jeanne Clery Act (Clery Act) will not release the names of victims or information that could easily lead to a victim's identification. H. Relationship Violence - under SHSON 's policies, the term \"relationship violence\" includes relationship violence, domestic violence, and dating violence as defined under federal and/or state law. Generally, Relationship Violence is a pattern of coercive behaviors that serve to exercise control and power in an intimate relationship. The coercive and abusi ve behav iors can be physical, sexual , psycho logical, verbal and/or emotional in nature. Intimate partner abuse can occur in relationships of the same or different genders, and/or between current or former intimate partners who have dated, lived together, or been married. Relationship Violence includes both domestic violence and dating violence. Under federal law: 50 o Domestic violence is def ined as felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabi tating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or New York family violence laws, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person's acts under New York domestic or family violence laws. o Dating violence is defined as violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. The existence of such a relationship is determined based on the reporting party's statement and with consi deration of the length of the relationsh ip, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationsh ip. For the purposes of this definition, dating violence includes, but is not limited to, sexual or phy sical abuse or the threat of such abus e. Dating violence does not include acts cove red under the definition of domestic violence. Under New York law, domestic violence is generally defined as a pattern of coercive tactics, which can include physical, psychological, sexual , econom ic and emotional abuse, perpetrated by one person against an adult intimate partner, with the goal of establishing and maintaining power and control over the victim. There is no specific crime of \"domestic violence\" under New York State law. Domestic violence is handled through the criminal courts and the Family Court as a \"family offense.\" A family offense is defined as certain acts/crimes delineated in the Penal Law (such as harassment, menacing, assaul t, and stalking) committed by a family member (individuals who are married, related by blood, or who have a child in common). Victims who meet this definition may go to criminal court to seek an order of protection and have the abuser p rosecu ted, or they may go to Family Court for an order of protection, services, and assi stance with custody and child support . Individuals victimized by an intimate partner who does not meet the definition of family member, such as a boyfriend or same-sex partner, can only go to criminal court for legal assistance. In addition, manda tory arrest, which applies when an abuser violates an order of protection or commits certain other offenses, is only applicable when a case involves individual s who meet the family definition. According to the NYS Office for the Prevention of Domestic, howeve r, many police departments in New York State use an expanded definition of family when making manda tory arrest determinations. This provides greater protection to victims who fall outside of the family definition, although these victims still do not have access to Family Court. I. Reporting Individual - a victim, survivor, complainant, claimant, or witness with victim status. The term reporting individual is limited to those who are directly impacted by the violation as victims. A bystander to a violation, or a third party who reports information about a violation that he or she has learned from a victim, is NOT a reporting individual. 51 J. Respondent - a person accu sed of a violation who has entered SHSON 's judicial or conduct process. K. Sexual Activity - has the same meaning as \"sexual ac t\" and \"sexual contact\" as provided 2) U.S.C. \u00a7 the term \"sexual activity\" includes the following: contact between the penis and the vulva or the penis and the anus, and for purposes of this definition contact involving the penis occu rs upon pene tration, however slight; contact between the mouth and the penis, the mouth and the vulva, or the mouth and the anus; the pene tration, however slight, of the anal or genital opening of another by a hand or finger or by any object, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person; the intentional touchi ng, not through the clothing, of the genitalia of another person w ho has not attained the age of 16 years with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person; or the intentional touching, either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person. Individuals must obtain affirmative consent (as defined above) prior to engagi ng in any of the activity referenced above. L. Sexual Assault - under SHSON 's policies, the term \"sexual assault\" includes a sexual assault as defined under federal and/or state law. Under federal law, the term \"sexual assault\" means an offense that meets the definition of rape, fondling, incest, or statutory rape as used in the FBI's UCR program and as set forth in Appendi x A to the Clery Act regulations (34 CFR \u00a7 668.46) . In Appendi x A to the Clery Act regulations, these terms are defined as follows: Rape - The pene tration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral pene tration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. Fondling - the touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, forcibly and/or against that person's will; or, not forcibly or against the person's will where the victim is incapabl e of giving consent because of his/her you th or becaus e of his/her temporary or permanen t mental or physical incapacity. Incest - sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law. 52 Statutory Rape - sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent. Under New York law, the age of consent is 17 years old. See New York State Penal Law Article 130. Under New Y ork law, \"sexual assault\" includes a ny and all \"sexual offenses\" defined in New York State Penal Code Article 130. These sexual offenses include sexual misconduc t, rape, sexual abuse, forcible touching, and aggravated sexual contact, and involve conduct that would gener ally fall within the abov e-listed definitions. However, these offenses also cover ce rtain actions, such as sexual assaul t with an object, which may not be included within the above listed de finitions. Studen ts and e mployees ar e encouraged to review the full definitions and elements of these offenses, which can be found in New York State Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 130.00 to 130.96. M. Sexual Offense - a term used by SHSON in this policy, which includes any incident of \"sexual ault,\" \"nonconse nsual sexual activity,\" \"relationship violence,\" and/or \"stalking,\" as those terms are defined in this policy. N. Stalking - under SHSON 's policies, the term \"stalking\" includes stalking as defined under federal and/or state law. Generally, stalking is a pattern of behavior that can include: Repeatedly leaving or sending victim unwanted items, presents, flowers Harassing the victim through the internet, including social networking websites Repea ted, unwanted and intrusive phone calls, e-mails or text messag es; especially after bei ng clearly informed to stop Damaging or threatening to damage the victim's property Following, monitoring, surveillance of victim and/or victim's family, friends, co- workers Abusing or killing a pet or other animal Crossing jurisdictions/bo rders to stalk/commit offenses Under the Clery Act regula tions, stalking means engag ing in a course of conduct directed at a spec ific person that would caus e a reasonable person to (a) fear for the person's safety or the safety of others; or (b) suffer subst antial emotional distress. For the purposes of this definition: \"course of conduc t\" means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, obse rves, surveils, threatens, or commu nicates to or about person, or interferes with a person's propert y; \"reasonabl e person\" means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim; and \"subst antial emotional distress\" means significant mental suffering or angui sh that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or coun seling. 53 Under New York law, a person engag es in stalking when he or she intentionally, and for no legitimate purpose, enga ges in a course of conduct directed at a spec ific person, and knows or reasonabl y shoul d know that such conduct: is likely to cause reasonable fear of material harm to the physical health, safety or property of such person, a member of such person's immediate family or a third party with whom such person is acqu ainted; or causes material harm to the mental or emotional health of such person, where such conduct consists of following (including unau thorized tracking of someone's movements or location through a GPS or other device), telephon ing or initiating communication or con tact with such person, a member of such person's immediate family or a third party with whom such person is acquainted, and the actor was previously clearly informed to ce ase that cond uct; or is likely to cause such person to reaso nably fear that his or her employment, business or ca reer is threatened, where such conduct consists of appear ing, telephon ing or initiating communication or contact at such person's place of employment or business, and the actor was previously clearly informed to cease that conduct. More detailed definitions can be found in New York State Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 120.45 to 120.60. II. Prohibited Acts The Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing (SHSON ) strictly prohibits all Sexual Offenses. In the event that a Sexual Offense does occur, SHSON will act to assist and protect the victim and act against the accused. SHSON 's Sexual Offense Policies & Procedu res are available to all students and employees, and are applica ble to any conduct that has a reasonabl e connection to SHSON . SHSON will apply the provisions of this policy regardless of whether the Sexual Offense occu rs on campus, off campus, or while a student or employee is participating in a study abroad program. When the Sexual Offense involves student s or employees from two or more institutions, SHSON will work collaboratively with the other institutions to address the Sexual Offense, provided that the collaboration complies with the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA). III. Non-discrimi nation SHSON applies the protections set forth in these policies and procedur es regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, creed, age, disability, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, familial status, pregnancy, predisposing genetic characteristics, military status, domestic violence victim status, criminal conviction, familial status, or any other protected characteristic under federal or state law. 54 Further, SHSON student s have the right to exercise their civil rights and practice of religion without interference by SHSON 's investigative, criminal justice, or judicial or conduct process. Additionally, SHSON will not force students to under go medical procedur es that they say are forbidden by their religion. SHSON will work with participants to ensu re they do not have to choose between participating in the process and practicing their religion. IV. Procedur e for Responding to a Sexual Offense If you believe you are the victim of a Sexual Offense, you shou ld follow the following procedur es: A. Get yourself to a safe place. Samaritan Hospital Security, the Troy Police Department, and/or the New York State Police can help you do this. Officers of those agencies are trained to respon d to the needs of a victim of a Sexual Offense. They can also make you aware of suppor t and advo cacy services and advise you about reporting procedu res and requirements. B. Obtain medical attention. For your safety and well-being, immediate medical attention is encour aged. Further, being examined as soon as possible is important in the case of sexual ass ault. Within 96 hour s of an assault, you c an get a Sexual Assaul t Forensic Examination (or \"SAFE,\" commonly referred to as a rape kit) at a hospital. We encourage you to receive immediate medical attention at a facility that uses SAFE, or Sexual Assaul t Forensic Examiners. Completing a SAFE will not require you to file a police report, but it will help to preserve evidence in case you decide at a later date to file a police report. Local hosp itals, with and without SAFE, include the following: Program/ Entity SAFE Facility? Location Contact Information Samaritan Hospital Yes 2215 Burdett Ave. Troy, NY 12180 P: 518-271-3300 Albany Medical Center Yes 43 New Scotland Ave. Albany, NY 12208 P: 518-262-3125 St. Peter's Hospital No 315 S.

You are encouraged to let hosp ital personnel know if you do not want your insurance policyho lder to be notified about your access to these services. Sexual contact can transmit Sexual ly Transmitted Infections (STIs) and may result in pregnancy. Testing for STIs and emergency contraception is available at: Remember that this medical treatment may also provide the opport unity for the collection and docum entation of evidence, shoul d you decide to pursue the incident and offender through the legal system. The Albany Police Department, the Troy Police Department, and/or the New York State Police may assist you in this effort as well. The New York State Office of Victim Services may also be able to assist in compensa ting you (v ictims/survivors) for health care and coun seling services, including emergency funds. More information may be found here: https://ovs.ny.gov/forms -and-publications , or here: https://ovs.ny.gov/help -crime -victims C. Preserve Evidence. We encourage you to take steps to preserve any and all evidence when a Sexual Offense occurs, as this evidence may be necessary to prove that the offense took place and/or to obtain a protective order. Be aware that the location of the offense, your c lothing, and your person may be considered a \"crime scene,\" and as such, a source of ev idence. The location of the incident shoul d be safe guarded and you shoul d avoid washing, douchi ng, using the toilet or chang ing your clothes prior to a medical/legal exam. To be st preserve evidence, you should avoid shower ing, washing, changing your clothes, combing your hair, drinking, eating, or doing anything to alter physical appearance until after a physical exam has been completed.

Second, you may (but are not required to) report the Sexual Offense to Samaritan Hospital /St. Mary's Campus Security Office. This may trigger the judicial process of SHSON , which may result in the removal of the offender from the campus. It also assists SHSON in complying with Federal requirements for reporting offenses occu rring on ca mpus. You may (but are not r equired to) report Sexual Offenses anonymously to Samaritan Hospital Security, preserving your pr ivacy and only reporting the particulars of the incident. 3. Third, you may also (but are not required to) report the Sexual Offense to a Compliance Officer (identified below) or any senior officer of SHSON or 57 Samaritan Hospital /St. Mary's Campus . When you first disclose an incident to a representative of SHSON , you will be presented w ith (1) a copy of the SHSON Manual of S exual Offense Policies & Procedures For Students and Employees (Part B of the Student Handbook), (2) a written explanation of your rights and options, whether the incident occu rred on or off-campus, and (3) the following information: \"You have the right to make a report to campus secu rity, local law enforcement, and/or state police or choo se not to report; to report the incident to your institution; to be protected by the institution from retaliation for reporting an incident; and to receive assistance and resources from your institution.\" You will have the right to emergency acce ss to the Title IX Coordinator or another appr opriate official who has been designated by the Title IX Coordinator to provide emergency assistance (the \"Designee\"). The Designee may be an official of SHSON or an official of an off campus resource. The Title IX Coordinator or Designee will be available upon the first instance of disclosure by a reporting individual to provide immediate information and assistance regarding (1) options to proceed, including other reporting options; (2) where applicable, the importance of preserving evidence and obtaining a sexual assaul t forensic examination as soon as possible; and (3) the criminal justice process, including that it utilizes different standar ds of proof and ev idence and that any questions about whether a specific incident violated the penal law shou ld be addressed to law enforcement or to the district attorney. The Title IX Coordinator or Designee will also explain whether he or she is authorized to offer you confidentiality or privacy, and will inform you about other reporting options. o The Title IX Coordinator will generally be available for emergency access on weekdays between the hours of 9am to 5pm, at the following: Diana O'Brien , Title IX Coordinator; 518- 331-1160 or diana.obrien@sphp.com o When the Title IX Coordinator is not available, emergency access to the Hospital's Administrator -on-Call is available by calling the operator at Samaritan Hospital: 518-271-3300 . Be aware that certain SHSON officials with significant respon sibility for student and e mployee ac tivities may be required by law to disclose the occurrence of the event. If you make a report to an official who is required by law to disclose the occu rrence of the event , but you request confidentiality, the Title IX coordinator will evaluat e the conf identiality request , by weighing the request aga inst SHSON 's obliga tion to provide a safe, non-discriminatory environment for all members of its community. If it is determined that the incident must be disclosed, your name will be kept confidential, and you will be offered privacy to the greatest extent possible. If it is determined that the incident must kept confidential, SHSON will still assist with acade mic, transport ation, and other reasonabl e and available acco mmoda tions. 58 Even SHSON officers a nd employees w ho cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible. The information you provide to a non- confidential resource will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek a resolution. Your identity will remain private at all times if you wish to maintain privacy. SHSON will make ever y effort to ensure that you are asked to describe the incident to as few representatives of SHSON as pos sible, and are not required to unnecess arily repeat a descr iption of the incident. 4. Fourth, in addition to, or in lieu of, reporting a Sexual Offense to one or more of the above, you may (but are not required to) make a confidential report to any Samaritan Hospital pastoral counselor , the Employee Assistance Program , (Carebridge or the Behavioral Health Department at Samaritan Hospital where you may meet with a psychologist or soci al worker ), a nurse- practitioner, or another other person with a pro fessional license or who is supervised by such a person. These employees are exempt from any requirement to further disclose your report to them, unless you want and ask them to do so. These employees can assist in obtaining services for you. 5. In addition, you may confidentially disclose the Sexual Offense and obtain services from the state or local government. 6. You can also make an anony mous report to confidential hotlines provided by New York state agenc ies and not-for-profit entities. These hotlines include: New York State Domestic and Sexual Violence Hotline: 1-800-942-6906. Equinox Hotline: 518-432-7865. Unity House Hotline: 518-272-2370. 1-800-799-7233.

Lastly, if the accu sed is an employee of SHSON , you c an report the Sexual Offense to Samaritan Hospital's Human Resources Department, or request that another employee assist in report ing to the Human Resources Depart ment. SHSON encour ages the victims of Sexual Offenses to report the incidents, in any of the manner s described abov e. However, aga in, victims are not required to report the offense to, or to seek assistance from SHSON , law enforcement, or campus authorities. SHSON will not pressure any student or employee to disclose a crime or violation, or to participate in the judicial, conduc t, or criminal justice processes. Reporting an incident does not: 59 obligate you to prosecute; subject you to inappropriate scrutiny or judgment by the person receiving the report; or sugge st in any way that you are at fault for the crime or violation, or shoul d have acted in a different manner to avoid the crime or violation. Reporting the incident does: ensure that you, as a victim of a Sexual Offense, receive necessary medical testing and treatment; and pr ovides the oppo rtunity for collection of evidence critical to prosecu tion, whi ch cannot be obtained later; ensu re that you have kno wledge of and acc ess to professional, confidential counse ling from a coun selor spec ifically trained in the areas of Sexual Offenses. E. Request to File Student Conduct Charges. If the accused or respon dent is a studen t, you may request that SHSON file studen t conduct charges against the accused or responden t. All studen ts have the right to request that SHSON bring student conduct charges against another studen t. Requests to file charges shou ld be prepared in writing and directed to the Director or Director of Student Services. Written reques ts may be emailed to the patricia.cannistraci@sphp.com or angela.cox@sphp.com or delivered in person to the Dean or the Student Services Dean at The Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing , 1300 Massachusetts Avenue, Troy, NY 12180. SHSON retains the right to determine whether to actually file the charges against the accused or respondent . SHSON can initiate charges or choose not to initiate them when evidence does or does not merit doing so, in conformity with state and federal law, SHSON's Student Code of Conduc t, and other SHSON policies. Additional details regarding Student Conduct charges c an be found in the Student Code of Conduc t, available in the Student Handbook. You shoul d be aware that there are significant differences between SHSON 's disciplinary system and the criminal justice system, becau se they have different, important goals. In the criminal justice system, prosecu tors pursue cases when they believe there is sufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonabl e doub t, that an individual has committed a criminal act. A person who is convicted of a crime will face criminal penalties, such as incarceration, probation, or the imposition of a fine. SHSON 's disciplinary process seek s to determine whether an individual has violated college policy. In this process, a preponde rance of the evidence standard of proof is used to determine responsi bility. A person who is found to have violated SHSON policy may be suspended , expelled or otherwise restricted from full participation in the SHSON community. F. Seek an Order of Protection /or No C ontact Order. 1. Orders of Protection Victims of Sexual Offenses may have a right to obtain a court order to protect themselves from the perpetrators. SHSON will enforce all applicable no 60 contact orders, restraining orders, and similar lawful orders issued by a criminal, civil, or tribunal court, to the extent required by law. An order of protection is issued by the court to limit the behav ior of someone who harms or threatens to harm another person. It is used to address various types of safety issues, including, but not limited to situations involving domestic violence. Family Courts, criminal court s, and Supreme Courts can all issue orders of protection. An order of protection may direct the offend ing person not to injure, threaten or harass you, your family, or any other person(s) listed in the order. A Family Court order of protection is issued as part of a civil proceedi ng. Its purpose is to stop violence within a family, or within an intimate relationship, and provide protection for those individuals affected. All Family Court proceedi ngs are confidential. To obtain an order of protection in the Family Court, your relationship to the other person must fall into one of the following categories: (1) current or former spouse, (2) someone with whom you have a child in common, (3) a family member to whom you are related by blood or marriage, or (4) someone with whom you have or have h ad an \"intimate relationship.\" An intimate relationsh ip does not have to be a sexual relationship. A relationsh ip may be considered intimate dependi ng on factors such as how often you see each other, or how long you have known each other. After a pe tition is filed, the cour t will dec ide if it is an intimate relationsh ip. To start a proceed ing in Family Court, you need to file a form called a Family Offense petition. You can contact the Family Court in your coun ty for help completing and filing the petition. Contact information for the Family Court in Tro y is as follows: Rensselaer County Family Court 1504 Fifth Avenue Troy, NY 12180 Phone: 518-453-5515 Fax: 518-285-8504 You may also wish to speak with an attorney or domestic violence advocate before filing. A criminal court order of protection is issued as a cond ition of a defendan t's release and/or bail in a criminal case. A criminal court order of protection may only be issued against a person who has been charged with a crime. SHSON will provide reporting individuals assistance from Samaritan Hospital Security , or other appropriate officials in obtaining an order of protection. The following individuals can be contacted for assistance in obtaining or under standing an Order of Protection: Rich Bytner, Director of Security, Acute Care Troy, SPHP Phone: 518- 271-3300 Richard.bytner@sphp.com 61 The Legal Project 24 Aviation Road, Suite 101 Albany, NY 12205 (518) 435-1770 (phone) (518) 435-1773 (Fax) www. legalproject.org SHSON will provide the accused or respondent and you (the reporting ind ividual) a copy of any order of protection or equivalent that SHSON receives.

SHSON will also ca ll on and assist local law enforcement in effecting an arre st when an individual violates an order of protection. 2. No Contact Orders You can ask SHSON to issue a \"no contact order\" to protect you from the respondent or acc used. When a studen t is accu sed of a Sexual Offense, SHSON is automatically required to issue a manda tory \"no contact order\" to protect you from the respondent or accused. This \"no contact order\" is a SHSON document that does not have the legal effect of an order of protection, which is obtained through a court. Under the no contact order: (1) the accused's continued intentional contact with the reporting individual is a violation of SHSON 's policy that is subject to additional conduct charges; and (2) if the accu sed or respondent and you (the reporting individual) observe each other in a public place, it is the respon sibility of the accused or responde nt to leave the area immediately and without directly contacting you (the reporting individual). This may include establishing a schedule of attendance for the accused or responde nt to acce ss certain locations at SHSON , such as academic buildings, libraries, and dining halls. To make a request to impose a SHSON \"no contact order,\" you can contact: Patricia Cannistraci, Dean or Angela Cox, Student Services Dean at: patricia.cannistraci@sphp.com or angela.cox@sphp.com Responsi bility to stay away falls upon the person subject to the \"no contact order\" (\"cove red person\"), not you ( the protected individual) . A cove red person may be a respondent or accu sed or a third party who is the subject of a no contact order. If the cove red person and you (the p rotected person) are in the same place accidentally, it is incumbent upon the cover ed person to remove himself or herself in a reason able time and manner. Upon reques t, both the accused (or responden t) and you ( the reporting 62 individual) are entitled to a prompt review, reasonabl e under the circumstances , of the need for and terms of the \"no con tact order\", including potential modification, in which they are allowed to submit evidence in suppor t of their request s. Request s to review a no contact order shou ld be subm itted to: Patricia Cannistraci, Dean or Angela Cox, Student Services Dean at patricia.cannistraci@sphp.com or angela.cox@sphp.com for a request for review is received from one party, the other party will be notified of the request for review. The Dean or the Student Services Dean will issue a determination in response to the request, and no tify both parties of the de termination. G. Initiate Legal Proceedings.

Policy for Alcohol and/o r Drug Use Amnesty for Students The health and safety of every student at SHSON is of utmost importance. SHSON recogni zes that student s who have been drinking and/or using drugs (whether such use is voluntary or involuntary) at the time that violence, including but not limited to domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assaul t, occurs may be hesitant to report such incidents due to fear of potential consequenc es for their own conduc t. SHSON strongly encou rages studen ts to report domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assaul t to institution officials. A bystander acting in good faith or a reporting individual acting in good faith who discloses any incident of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assaul t to SHSON 's officials or law enforcement will not be subject to SHSON 's Student Code of Conduct action for violations of alcohol and/or drug use policies occu rring at or near the time of the commission of the domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assaul t. VI. Immed iate Consequen ces Following a Report of a Sexual Offense A. Mandatory No Contact Order As discussed above, when the accused or responde nt is a student , SHSON will issue a mandat ory \"no contact order\" mandat ing that (1) the accused's continued intentional con tact with the reporting individual is a violation of SHSON 's policy that is subject to addi tional conduct charges; and (2) if the accu sed or respondent and a reporting individual observe each other in a public place, it is the responsi bility of the accu sed or respondent to leave the area immediately and without directly contacting the reporting individual . B. Mandatory Interim Suspension When the accused or respondent is a student determined to present a continuing threat to the health and safety of the community, the accused or respondent will be subject to an interim suspensi on pendi ng the outcome of a judicial or conduct process. Upon reques t, SHSON will provide both the accu sed or responde nt and the reporting individual a prompt review, reasona ble under the circumstances, of the need for and terms of an interim suspen sion, including potential modification, in which they are allowed to submit evidence in suppor t of their request .

The Dean or the Dean of Student Services will issue a determination in response to the request , and notify both parties of the determination. 65 C. Mandatory Interim Measures When the accu sed or respondent is not a studen t, but is a member of SHSON 's or the Samaritan Hospital community and pr esents a continuing threat to the health and safety of the community, SHSON or Samaritan Hospital will subject the acc used or respond ent to interim measu res in accor dance with app licable collective bargaining agreements, employee handbook s, and rules and policies of SHSON . D. Additional Interim Measures and Accommo dations SHSON and Samaritan Hospital will offer reason able and available interim measures and accommodations that effect chang es in academic, transport ation or other applicable arrangements in order to help ensure safety, prevent retaliation, and avo id an ongoi ng host ile environment, consistent with SHSON 's and Samaritan Hospital's policies and procedu res. These interim measures may include: suppor t services (victim advoc acy, housing assistance, academi c support , coun seling, health and mental health services, legal assistance); chang ing work assignments and situations (for employees); chang ing course schedul es, assignments, or test schedul es (for students); no contact orders, campus escorts, transpo rtation assistance, or targeted interventions; providing increased monitoring, supe or secu rity; and/or providing an escort . SHSON is obligated to comply with a student 's reaso nable request for academi c situation changes following an alleged Sexual Offense. SHSON will protect the confidentiality of acco mmoda tions or protective measures provided to a complainant or accu ser, to the extent that doing so will not impair SHSON 's ability to provide the accommo dations or protective measures. The complainant or accu ser will be informed before SHSON shares any personally identifying information that SHSON believes is necessary to provide an acco mmodation or protective measure. If this occu rs, the com plainant or acc user will be told what information will be shared, with whom it will be shared, and why it will be shared. Upon request , SHSON will provide bot h the accu sed or respondent and the reporting individual a prom pt review, reason able under the circumstances, of the need for and terms of any such interim measu re and accommodation, that directly affects him or her, in which he or she is allowed to submit evidence in suppor t of h is or her reque st. In the even t that an accommoda tion or interim measure granted to or against one party impacts another party, both the directly impacted party and the secondarily impacted party may request a review of the terms or totality of the accommodation and/or measure by SHSON and may submit information as to the reasoni ng for reque sting a change.

Investigation and Disci plinary Procedur es for Sexual Offense Cases When SHSON becomes aware of a Sexual Offense by or against an employee or student or that has a reasonabl e conne ction to SHSON , it will take prompt and appropriate action. A. Initial Assessment . The Title IX Coordinator will make an initial assessment regarding the validity of any information received about the incident. This initial assessment will be made within five (5) business days of SHSON becoming aware of the suspected Sexual Offense B. Consent of Reporting Individual. If the Title IX Coordinator de termines that an investigation is required, he or she m ust seek consent from reporting individuals prior to conduc ting an investigation. If a report ing individual does not cons ent to the request to initiate an investigation, the Title IX Coordinator will weigh the request against SHSON 's obligation to provide a safe, nond iscriminatory environment for all members of its community. SHSON will honor a request to decline to consent to an investigation, unless SHSON determines in good faith that failure to investigate does not adequa tely mitigate a potential risk of harm to the reporting individual or other members of the community, based on the Title IX Coordinator's consideration of factors that include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Whether the accu sed has a history of violent behavior or is a repeat offende r; 2. Whether the incident represents escalation in unlawful conduct on behalf of the accused from previously noted behav ior; 3. The increased risk that the accu sed will commit additional acts of violence; 4. Whether the accu sed used a weapon or force; 5. Whether the reporting individual is a minor; 6. Whether the institution posse sses other means to obtain evidence such as security footage, and 7. Whether available information reveal s a pattern of perpetration at a given location or by a particular group. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that the request to decline to consent to an investigation can be honor ed, SHSON will still assist with academi c, transportation, and other reasona ble and available accommodations. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that a request to decline to consent to an investigation cannot be honor ed, and an investigation is necessary, SHSON must notify the reporting individuals and take immediate action as necessary to protect and assist them. Investigation and Disciplinary Procedure at a Glance A. Conduct i nitial assessment B. Seek consent from reporting individual C. Conduct investigation D. Issue findings and recommendations E. Decide upon disciplinary action F. Hear appeal by either party G. Issue final decision 67 C. Investigation . When an investigation is commenced, and the accu sed is a student , the Title IX investigator must provide the studen t, as promptly as possi ble, with a copy of this Manual, and must inform the student o f (1) the spec ific rule, rules, laws, and/or code of conduct provisions alleged to have been violated; (2) the date, time, location and factual allegations concerning the violation; (3) in what manner the specific rule, rules or laws are alleged to have been violated, and (4) the sanction or sanc tions that may be imposed on the respon dent based upon the outcome of any judicial or conduct process. Within two (2) business days of determining that an investigation is necessary, the Title IX Coordinator will designate a trained investigator, such as the Director o f Security for Acute Care Troy , SPHP , who does not have a conf lict of interest, to promptly conduct a fair, complete, thorough, and impartial investigation that provides a meaningful opportunity to be heard. If the accused person is an employee, howeve r, the Vice-President of Human Resources will conduct the investigation. Each of the designated investigators, receives annual training on: (1) i ssues related to sexual assaul t, relationship violence, and stalking, (2) how to conduct an investigation and hearing process that pr otects the safety of victims and promotes accoun tability, (3) how to condu ct investigations of sexual violence, (4) the effects of trauma, (5) impartiality, (6) the rights of the respondent , including the right to a presumption that the respondent is \"not respon sible\" until a finding of responsibility is made, (7) SHSON 's policies and procedur es, and other issues. If the Title IX Coordinator is implicated in the report, the Dean will be responsi ble for designating a trained investigator to conduct the investigation. If it wou ld be inappr opriate for the Title IX Coordinator or Dean to designate the trained investigator to conduct the investigation, then the Chair of the Board of Trustees will make this designation. The standard of evidence used to eval uate a report of a Sexual Offense by or against an employee or student is a \"preponder ance of the evidence.\" Under this standar d, a determination must be made on the basis of whether it is more likely than not that the accused student or employee violated the Sexual Offense Policies & Procedu res for Student s and Employees. In investigating the complaint, the investigator shall: 1. Meet with the appropriate individuals and review all appr opriate records that bear on the case. 2. Discuss the allegations in th e complaint with the acc user and accused at separate meetings, and provide the accuser and accused with equal oppor tunities to identify witnesse s and present evidence support ing their respec tive positions at these meetings. 3. Provide the acc user and the acc used with the same oppo rtunities for a suppo rt person or adv isor of their choice throughout the pr ocess, including any meeting, conference, hea ring or other proced ural action. An attorney for either the accu ser or the accused, howeve r, may be present but may not have a s peaking role during such meetings, con ferences, hearings, or other procedur al actions. 4. Where the reporting individual or accu sed are students, provide the student s with: 68 a. reason able advance written or electronic notice of any meeting they are required to or are eligible to attend, b. an oppor tunity to subm it evidence during an investigation conce rning a report of a Sexual Offense, and c. the oppor tunity to exclude (1) their own prior sexual history with persons other than the other party in the conduct process and (2) their own mental health diagnosi s and/or treatment from the investigator's consideration w hen determining respon sibility. (Howeve r, the investigator may consider past findings of a Sexual Offense when determining the sanc tion to be imposed ). 5. Attempt, where appropr iate, to resolve the complaint by exp loring and suggesting possi ble solutions to the problem with all involved parties, provided, however , that the complainant or accu ser will not be required to participate in mediation with the accused. 6. If the precedi ng step does not resolve the problem, make and transmit a preponder ance of the evidence determination in the matter of the allegation of the Sexual Offense to the accused, accuser, and the Title IX Coordinator. The time necessary to complete an investigation will vary depending upon the facts of a particular ca se. In most cases, investigations will be completed within 60 days of receipt of a report. D. Findings and Recommendations . The investigator who conduc ted the investigation shall prepare written findings of fact a nd recommenda tions, w ith respect to whether it is more likely than not that the Sexual Offense occurred, appropr iate disciplinary actions, if any, and/or other appropriate remedial measures. Once the investigation is complete, the parties will be informed, in writing, of the outcome within two (2) business days of the issuanc e of the determination. When the victim or accu sed is a student , this written notice will include the result of the investigation, any recommended sanc tions, the rationale for the result and any recommended sanctions, the findings of fact, and a notification if conduct charges will be pursued and/or continued. Delivery of this outcome will not be delayed to either party, and shou ld occur as nearly simultaneou sly as possible, without unneces sarily bringing those in conflict into close proximity to each other. Should any change in outcome occur prior to finalization, all parties will be timely informed in writing, and will be notified when the results of the resolution process beco me final. 1. Finding of no violation. I f the investigator conc ludes that the accused student or employee did not violate the policies set forth in this Manual , SHSON will not pursue discipli ne against the student or employee. The parties will be informed of their potential rights to exercise a request for an appeal of the determination pursuant to SHSON Policy #203, Appeals Procedure, by requesting such appeal within two busi ness days of the decision. 2. Finding of violation. I f the investigator conc ludes that it is more likely than not that the accu sed studen t or employee violated the policies set forth in this Manual , SHSON will take the matter very seriously, and will pursue (or continue to pursue) internal disciplinary proceedi ngs against the accused or responden t. The Title IX Coordinator will refer the matter to the SPHP Vice-president for Human Resources (for employees) or Director of Student Services (for students) to determine whether to pursue disciplinary charges, within five (5) business days of the 69 investigator's determination. 3. Remedial measures. If the investigation reveal s that a Sexual Offense did occu r, SHSON will take also take appropriate remedial measures necessary to end such cond uct, prevent any such future conduc t, and correct a ny personnel or academic decisions made which are related to the prohibited conduc t. Remedies may include, but ar e not li mited to, cont inuing or co abov e-listed \"interim measu res.\" These remedies are separate from, and in addition to, any interim measu res that may have been p rovided prior to the conc lusion of the invest igation. Such measu res can b e reque sted by a report ing individual or accuser, by contacting the Director of Human Resources (for employees) or the Director or Director of Student Services ( for studen ts). E. Disciplinary Action . 1. Decision not to take disciplinary action. I f the Vice-president for Human Resources (for employees) or Dean (for students) determines not to take disciplinary action, SHSON will not pursue discipli ne against the student or employee. The parties will be informed of their potential rights to exercise a request for an appeal of the determination, if applicable, pur suant to SHSON Policy #203, Appeals Procedure by requesting such appeal w ithin two busi ness days of the decision. 2. Decision to take disciplinary action against an employee. If the Vice- president for Human Resources determines to take disciplinary action against an accused employee, i nformation regarding internal disciplinary proceedi ngs for employees can be found in the policies of St. Peter's Health Partners Human Resources Department. 3. Decision to take disciplinary action against a student. I f the Dean determines to take disciplinary action against a student, the following process will be followed: a. The Dean will determine an appropriate disciplinary action. Discipline for incidents of Sexual Offense may take a variety of forms, dependi ng upon the circumstances of a particular case. The disciplinary sanctions which may be imposed on studen ts who have been found responsi ble for comm itting any of the Sexual Offenses are the following: warning, disciplinary probation, loss of privileges, fines, restitution, sion, expul sion, revocat ion of a degree, withholding a degr ee, choosing not to recommend the graduate to the NYSED Board for Nursing for licensure as a nurse, and mandatory assessment/coun seling. b. The Dean will inform both the accused student and the reporter in writing of the disciplinary action, and of the right of either party to request an appeal with the Appeals Committee within 5 business days of such notice. In the event neither party appeal s within 5 days of the notice, the disciplinary action is not subject to further appeal and shall be imposed. F. Appeals . Appeal proceedi ngs where a studen t is acc used of a Sexual Offense ar e conducted in accordance with SHSON Policy #203 - Appeals Process, as modified by this paragraph. Such process is fair and impartial, include timely notice of meetings and timely and equal access to information and ev idence that will be 70 used, and are conduc ted by unbiased decision makers who have no conflict of interest. The proceed ings are completed within a reaso nably prompt, designated timeframe. However , the timeframe may be extended for good cause upon written notice to the accuser and acc used. The proceedings provide student s with the oppor tunity to present evidence and testimony at a hearing. G. Final Decision . Following any appeal proceedi ng for cases of Sexual Offense, the victim and accu sed w ill be provided with simultaneous written notice of the findings of fact, decision and the rationale for such decision, and any disciplinary recommendation . The Dean then will make the final decision. There is no further review or procedure available from SHSON . SHSON will protect all information obtained about studen ts during the course of the disciplinary process from public release, until the Appeal s Committee makes a final determination. An action taken by SHSON under this Section will be invalidated by the failure of SHSON to meet one of the time limits imposed herein, unless a party can show actual prejudice to his or her case from the delay. Engaging in a Sexual Offense may also lead to civil and/or criminal action under the New York State Penal Law. Any employee, who, in violation of SHSON's policy or SPHP policy, engages in a Sexual Offense, is acting outside the scope of his or her employment and may be personally liable for such actions and their consequences. In the event legal proceedings are commenced against such an employee, SHSON or SPHP may decline to provide legal, financial, or other assistance. In any proceeding brought against SHSON which seeks to vacate or modify a finding that a student engaged in Sexual Offense, SHSON (1) will t reat the name and identifying biographical information of any student as presumptively confidential, and (2) will not include this information in the pleadings and other papers in such proceeding absent a waiver or cause shown as determined by the court; a nd will identify student witnesses only as numbered witnesses. VIII. Notation on Student Transcrip ts for Crimes of Violence If a student is suspended or expelled as a result of being found respon sible for a Crime of Violence, SHSON must make a notation on the student 's transcript that the student was \"suspended after a finding of respon sibility for a code of conduct violation\" or \"expel led after a finding of respon sibility for a code of conduct violation.\" If a student withdraws from SHSON while such c onduct charges related to crimes of violence are pending against the student , and declines to complete the disciplinary process, SHSON must make a notation on the studen t's transcript that he or she \"withdrew with conduct charges pendi ng.\" These transcr ipt notations can be appealed by contacting the Dean or the D ean of Student Services . Transcript notations for violence-related suspensions shall not be removed prior to one year a fter conc lusion of the suspension. Transcript notations for violence- related expul sions shall never be removed from a studen t's transcript. A notation for an expulsion may not be removed via an appeal to SHSON . If a finding of respon sibility is vacated for any reason, howev er, the transcript notation must be removed. F urther, if a court of competent jurisdiction vaca tes a finding of 71 responsi bility for a violation of college policy, the transcript notation memorializing that finding w ill also be vaca ted. IX. Prohibition of Retaliation It is a violation of federal and state law and this policy for any employee or student to retaliate against any student or employee for exercising any rights or responsibilities under the Violence Against Women Act, the Clery Act, and/or Title IX. This includes retaliating against a student or employee w ho reports a Sexual Offense in good faith, or furnishes information or participates in any manner in an investigation of such a report. Retaliation includes any conduct directed at someone because he or she engaged in such protected activity, which might deter a reasonabl e student or employee from making or support ing such a report. Retaliation is unlawful and will not be tolerated. SHSON will protect student s from retaliation by SHSON , any student , the accused and/or the responden t, and/or their friends, family and acqu aintances w ithin SHSON 's jurisdiction. A ny individual found to have engaged in retaliation will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including, termination of employment and/or dismissal from SHSON . Any employee or student who feels as though someone has subjected him or her to retaliation as a result of a report or participation into the investigation of a report shou ld contact a Compliance Officer (identified below) or other senior officer immediately. X. Compliance Officers SHSON has appointed certain individuals as Compliance Officers. The Compliance Officers are respon sible for assisting in the resolution of reports of Sexual Offenses. In addition, Compliance Officers are respon sible for being proactive in creating an atmosphere that will inhibit Sexual Offenses. A list of these individuals is set forth below: Patricia Cannistraci, Dean Phone: 518- Rich Bytner richard.bytner@sphp.com and Emplo yees It is the policy of SHSON to offer multiple methods of educat ional programming to all student s and e mployees each year to prevent Sexual Offenses. SHSON has adopt ed a comprehen sive student onboar ding and ongoi ng educat ion campaign to educa te members of SHSON 's community about Sexual Offenses, in compliance with applicable federal and state laws. 72 As part of this campaign, SHSON offers training to all first-year and transfer student s, during the course of their onboar ding, on the following topics, using a method and manner determined by SHSON : 1. SHSON prohibits sexual and interpersonal violence and will offer resources to any victims and survivors of such violence while taking administrative and conduct action regarding any accused individual within the jurisdiction of the institution; 2. Relevant definitions includ ing, but not limited to, the definitions of sexual assaul t, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, confidentiality, privacy, and consent; 3.

A reporting individual shall not be identified in a timely warning. FERPA allows SHSON to share information with par ents when (i.) there is a health or safety emergency, or (ii.) when the student is a depen dent on either parent's prior year federal income tax return.

HIPAA The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 is a federal law created to reform the health insurance market and simplify health care transactions and processes. The law is designated to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system by standardizing electronic transmission of certain healthcare transactions. The goal of HIPAA is to protect the privacy and security of all health care information, including transmitted information. Protected health information may be used or disclosed only to the individual or personal representative; for treatment, payment or health care operations; for special purposes set forth in HIPAA regulations; for any other purpose, with the individual's authorization. MEDITECH PATIENT CARE DATABASE AND CONFIDE NTIALITY The Meditech patient care database is a confidential clinical information system. It is the policy of this institution and the school that ALL patient information is confidential and that access to that information is a privilege which carries wi th it ethical and legal responsibilities and sanctions. Student Access Students are eligible to access the Meditech system on a \"need- to-know\" basis. The purpose of this access is to obtain patients' information directly related to clinical objectives in nursing courses, as well as to utilize the word processing and internal e- mail capabilities of the system. This is a privilege that facilitates clinical learning. Student Employees Some of the students of the school are also employees of the hospital. If you hold this dual status, as an employee, while working in your employed status, you are eligible to use the computer system in whatever capacity your employer deems appropriate for your job position. You will have separate passwords for your work and student access. You must not access the system outside of your work time with your work password. Printed Material Students may NOT remove any printed information with patient identification on it from the building - this is removing a patient chart. Patient lab reports and medication lists may be taken out of the hospital only if all patient identifiers have first been removed from these documents. Students may not photocopy any part of a patient's chart. 95 REGULATORY Passwords No one may allow anyone else access to the Meditech system on her/his password. If the person asking for use of the system is an eligible user, they must access the system through their own password. Do not \"buddy up\" while using the computer. Students who share their password may be dismissed. Do not allow anyone who does not have a password into the system to \"show them what it can do\". This is not a reference library system - it is confidential information. Sanctions Please be mindful of the sancti ons that apply to breach of confidentiality. These are listed in the Personnel Policies of the hospital. The final sanction for any behavior that violates these rules is termination of employment/dismissal from the school. In addition, violation of HIPAA regulations is a felony and may prohibit applicants from licensure as a nurse, or loss of license for those who already hold a license. FAMILY RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records. An eligible student under FERPA is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a postsecondary institution. In addition, parents are afforded the same rights as students, as long as the student is claimed as a dependent on either of their parent's Federal Income Tax Return, and there is proper presentation of the dependency condition. These rights include: 1 . The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days after the day the Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing (SHSON) receives a request for access. A student should submit to the Dean or other appropriate official, a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The school official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the school offic ial to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2.The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading. A student who wishes to ask SHSON to amend a record should write the school official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed. If SHSON decides not to am end the record as requested, SHSON will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student's right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to provide written consent before SHSON discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. 96 SHSO N discloses education records without a student's prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by SHSON in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law en forcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance com mittee. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of SHSON who performs an institutional service or function for which SHSON would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of SHSON with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent or a student volunteering to assist another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the SHSON . Upon request, SHSON may also disclose education records without consent to offi cials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. SHSON has designated the following information as \"directory information\": student's name, address, telephone listing, participation in officially recognized activities, major, dates of attendance, date of birth , enroll ment status, and degrees and awards received, and digitized image/photograph/video. The school may disclose any of this information without prior consent, unless notified in writing to the contrary within 30 days of the beginning of the term. 4.The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by SHSON to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department o f Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202 97 BILLING AND FINANCIAL AID BURSAR'S OFFICE ( 518-268-5028 ) All billing inquiries, payments, refunds, scholarships, etc. are handled through the Bursar's Office of the School of Nursing.

DETERMINATION OF FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY: There are two types of financial aid at Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing: Grants and Scholarships: These programs are forms of gift aid and do not have to be repaid. Educational Student Loans: Loans are available through the federal government and must be repaid. Eligibility Requirements : In order to qualify for federal, state or institutional financial aid, there are some basic eligibility requirements which must be met. Enrollment at least on a half-time basis (6 credits per semester) as a matric ulated student working toward a degree or certificate in an eligible program. Please Note: Federal and NY State financial aid regulations require that the courses must be a part of the School of Nursing's required curriculum which includes the Nursing courses, the co- requisite courses and the directed elective courses. Confirmation of US citizenship or eligible non -citizen status. Satisfactory academic progress must be maintained. Regist ration with Selective Service, if required... 105 Establishme nt of financial need for need based programs. Not be in default on a student loan, or owe a repayment on a previous financial aid award received at any institution. Valid Social Security number. Reporting Requirements: Any student enrolled for the Fall a nd/or Spring semesters must be reported to the National Student Loan Database System (NSLDS) whether or not they plan to take out loans for that semester, if they have previously taken out loans from same school or another school in the past and are in rep ayment or deferment. Reporting involves notifying NSLDS of the status of the student including current semester begin and end dates, enrollment status (less than half time, half time, \u00be time, full time, approved leave of absence, withdrawn, graduated), length of the program (RN - 2 years) etc. Students who take a leave of absence or enroll less than half time (under 6 credit hours) during the Fall and/or Spring semester , will be required to complete an exit interview through studentloans.gov and may go into grace or repayment. For the summer semester, enrollment only needs to be reported for students who are at least half time status. If they are taking less than half time (under 6 credits) or nothing at all for the summer, then their status does not need to be reported for that semester. They will not need to complete an exit interview f or summer. FINANCIAL NEED Financial Aid for Title IV (federal student aid) funds are awarded on the basis of \"need. \" College expenses (known as Cost of Attendance) include actual tuition and fees, the average cost for books, and the estimated cost for t ransportation , living expenses and other miscellaneous personal expenses . The student's ability to pay is calculated from family income , the size of the family, the number of family members in college , and family assets . The difference between Cost of At tendance and the student's ability to pay is the student's \"need\". Cost of Attendance : The table below illustrates the estimated expenses for a first year, full time RN student of different status: All numbers are U. S. Dollars. COMMUTER OUT OF STATE Tuition and Fees $9641 $11440 Living Expenses $11000 $3000 $3000 VERIFICATION PROCESS The Department of Education uses a system of edits to select student financial aid applications (FAFSAs) for verification. This process involves the collection of 106 additional supporting documentation to compare and correct inaccurate information that may have been supplied on the financial aid application. Students whose applications are selected for verification will be notified by the Financial Aid Office and inf ormed of any additional documentation/forms that must be completed. Once the verification process is completed, any necessary changes will be made and the student's expected contribution will be recalculated. The Financial Aid Office will make the corre ctions and send notification to the student. In addition to the verification process, all student financial aid applications are compared with other databases to ensure accurate information and to flag potential problems. The matches include the Select ive Service Agency files, Immigration and Naturalizations files, Social Security Administration files and National Student Loan Database System (NSLDS). Errors or problems are indicated on the student 's Student Aid Report OR ISIR and must be resolved prior to the disbursement of any federal funds. The Financial Aid Office will notify students of any database match problems and the process to resolve the issues. DEPENDENCY OVERRIDE FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID This is for students classified as \"dependent\" by the U.S. Department of Education's definition of a dependent student. The college recognizes that the awarding of federal student aid is based on the assumption that the primary responsibility of meeting college expenses rests with the student and the student's parents. Using a nationwide need analysis formula, the federal government requires both student and parent income and resources information in determining aid eligibility. The family's ability to pay for college is based on the information prov ided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Occasionally, due to \"unusual circumstances\", students should not be considered dependent. The federal government has given financial aid professionals authority to use their \"professional jud gment' in determining if a dependency override is warranted in unusual circumstances. The dependent student can request a waiver of federal regulations requiring parental information if he/she can document why they should be considered independent. The student should contact the Financial Aid Coordinator for what required documentation will be requested for a Dependency Override as well as the policy and procedures guidelines. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT The Privacy Act exists to protect your rights to confidentiality.

Please Note: Misre presentation, misreported information and/or altered documentation for the purpose of increasing your eligibility of fraudulently obtaining Federal or any other financial aid funds will result in the student being reported to the Office of Inspector General or the local law enforcement agency. 109 STANDARD OF SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (SAP ) The definitions for Federal and State Financial Aid SAP are different. In addition, make sure you are familiar with the School's Academic Progress and Grading policy which is defined in the School of Nursing catalog . It is different from the Financial Aid SAP policy. In order to remain a student in good academic standing and be eligible for most types of financial aid, students must make satisfactory academic progress. Students requesting Title IV federal financial aid must : Maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0. GPAs are reviewed at the end of each semester. Students who fail to maintain the minimum GPA will be given ONE semester of \"Aid Probation\" in which they must achieve a 2.0 cumulative GPA. Make progress toward their degree as follows: Full Time: 24 credits per academic year \u00be Time: 18 credits per academic year \u00bd Time: 12 credits per academic year Fewer than 6 credits: complete all attempted credits within two semesters. Repeated classes are not eligible to be counted as credits earned toward academic progress since each class can only be counted once. Students requesting/receiving financial aid are expected to complete their academic program within a reasonable time frame as follows: Full Time : 3 academic years Part Time : 4 academic years Students dismissed from the school and later readmitted, are academically eligible for Title IV funds immediately . 110 150% Direct Subsidized Loan Limit ***NOTE: If you are a first time borrower or have paid off your prior loans and are now borrowing again after July 1, 2013, this Federal regulation applies to you.*** You will no longer be eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans once you have received Direct Subsidized Loans for the period of 150% of the published length of the borrower's current educational program. For the RN prog ram, 150% is 3 years. If you lose eligibility of subsidized loans, you will also lose interest subsidy on subsidized loans received on or after July 1 st, 2013 during all periods if you do not complete the program and continue enrollmen t in the same program OR enroll in another program of the same or shorter length. The only exception is if you complete the program and then go on to another one in longer length, you would not lose the subsidy. Loss of interest subsidy cannot be regained. The calculation of determining when 150% limit met is: Maximum eligibility period less total of subsidized usage periods equals remaining eligibility period. The amount of subsidized is not based on the dollar amount - it is based on the amount of time you receive it. If your enrollment status is less than full -time, the calculated subsidized usage period is prorated for less than full -time enrollment. If you leave our program and go to another institution, the subsidized limit does not start over at 0% borrowed. If you do not borrow the full amount of subsidized offered to you, you will not be eligible for any unsubsidized loans. There will be a message on the FAFSA when you complete it to notify you and the school of any issues in regards to the 150% limit regulation. 111 APPEALS OF SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS STANDARDS Students have the right to appeal Satisfactory Academic Progress standards. However, the submission of an appeal is only a request and does not imply that a financial aid hold will be removed or that approval of the appeal is forthcoming.

Earned Title IV Aid: Students earn their federal financial aid by attending classes. Federal regulations, according to the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, require the School of Nursing to recalculate a student's financial aid eligibility if the student withdraws from or stops attending his/her classes before completing at least 60% of the semester. After the 60% point of the semester, 100% of the Tit le IV aid is considered \"earned\" by the student. The earned percentage is applied to the total amount of the Title IV gra nt and loan assistance that was disbursed (or could have been disbursed) to the student. Unearned Percentage : Any amount in excess of the allowed percentage must be returned to the appropriate Title IV program by the school, the student , or both. The school must return the lesser of the unearned Title IV assistance or an amount equal to the total liability incurred by the student multiplied by the unearned percentage. Tuition Liabilit y: If a student officially or unofficially withdraws after the end of the school's refund period, the student is liable for all his or her tuition and fees, even if the student's financial aid is decreased. If the student's financial aid previously covered his or her bill, but no longer covers it after the Return of Titl e IV Aid calculation, the student will be expected to pay for his or her outstanding tuition and fees. In addition, if the student receives a disbursement of financial aid, and the Return of Title IV Aid calculation shows that the student was not entitled to the funds, the student will be billed for the funds, and the overpayment information will be forwarded to the U. S. Department of Education. It will be the student's responsibility to repay the funds before he or she is eligible to receive any further federal student aid, even if the st udent attends another college. This overpayment will appear on the Student Aid Report until the overpayment is repaid. 116 Definitions for Title IV Program; The following is an explanation of the difference between a refund and a repayment: Refund: The difference between moneys originally paid for institutional charges by financial aid and or cash payments and the amount retained by the institution after withdrawal. If a student received federal financial aid, a portion of the refund must be returned to those programs. Repayment: The amount that a student must pay back to the school if federal financial funds were received, in excess of institutional charges. The school will return the Student Financial Aid (SFA) program portion of the refund/repayment to the source of funding in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan Subsidized Federal Direct Loan Federal Plus Loan Federal Pell Grant Other sources Student The refund/repayment disbursal will be 100% to the SFA programs in order of the priority listed until the funds are exhausted. Determination of Date of Withdrawal Official Withdrawal : The date the student began the withdrawal process or the date the student officially notifies Student Services in writ ing that he/she is withdrawing from the program. The percentage of eligibility for federal financial aid will be directly related to the percentage of the semester completed. For example: if a student completes 10% of the semester, he/she will be eligible for 10% of his/her federal financial aid. If he/she completes 30% of the semester, he/she will receive 30% of his/her financial aid etc. Unofficial Withdrawal : If the student leaves school without giving notice, the student's last recorded day of a ttendance as documented by the school will be used. In the absence of attendance records, the midpoint of the semester will be used. Process for Determining Refunds/Repayments Student's date of withdrawal will be calculated using the federal withdrawal record. For both Federal Financial Aid Recipients and Non- Federal Financial Aid Recipients the Refund policy of the school will be applied for tuition, fees and other charges Repayment/refunds will be determined by using the federal software provided by the U. S. Department of Education governing the money involved. Allocation of a refund/repayment to the SFA program sources will be within 45 days of the withdrawal dat e to the federal programs, within 60 days to the lender and within 30 days to the student. If a repayment is required by the student, he/she will be notified of the need to repay the Federal Student Aid programs. 117 Verification of Process When a student withdraws from the school, the calculati on work sheet will be completed and filed in the student's Financial aid folder/billing records as a record of this policy's application and the record of returned refund/repayment as required. All student s will have the following documentation attached to their final bill: Withdrawal Record - with copy of change of status/written note or attendance sheet. Refund calculation sheet If necessary - refund/repayment/prorata sheets per federal policy Samples of all forms are available upon request. Once a refund/repayment is determined, t he Bursar will attach all paper work to the bill, and process through accounting so that distribution is made within 30 days of the refund/ repayment calculation date.
