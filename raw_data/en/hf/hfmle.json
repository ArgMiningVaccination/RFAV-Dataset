DOE has a rich and impactful history, populated by brilliant pioneers who then, and now, strive to overcome the Nation's greatest challenges. Over the past four years, DOE made energy production, reliability, and security a top priority. By pursuing a true \"all-of-the-above\" American energy strategy that leverages all sources and all technologies, DOE has made innovation the cornerstone of our success. The accomplishments achieved in pursuit of this policy pushed our economy to new heights and will help drive our post-pandemic economic comeback. Between the years 2017 and 2020, America realized an energy renaissance unprecedented in our history. The implementation of a pro-growth tax and regulatory agenda, combined with Executive actions promoting energy exploration and infrastructure development, led to the United States securing the enviable position of being the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas. Our robust production brought with it economic and consumer benefits here at home, but it also allowed us to export energy to trading partners around the globe. Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) exports from the United States reached an all-time high at the end of 2020, enough to meet nearly one-fifth of current global LNG demand. To date, the United States has exported LNG to over 38 countries spanning five continents. Meanwhile, in 2019, U.S. civil nuclear power plants generated the most electricity ever produced by a fleet in the world, and our solar and wind energy production each ranked second globally. The foundation of these and so many other accomplishments can be found in innovation stemming from DOE programs and research conducted by our 17 award winning National Laboratories. Our Laboratories are working on some of the most difficult challenges we face as a Nation. The following pages tell of both the achievements and the on-going work at DOE, which have cemented America's place as the global leader in science and energy innovation. Maintaining this leadership is paramount for the future of our Nation. In particular, our laboratories support DOE's critical role in national security, especially in the stewardship of the Nation's nuclear deterrent and the protection of the U.S. grid from physical and cyber threats. From supporting NASA's exploration of distant planets and developing novel ways to benefit from resources beneath our feet, to advancing plastics recycling techniques and harnessing the power of the sun and wind, DOE's National Laboratories are leading America into a safe, prosperous future. Chief among the benefits of serving as Secretary is the opportunity to work alongside the incredible DOE men and women driving the discovery and innovation. I hope readers will benefit from learning about the role that the National Laboratories play in advancing the Department's mission to address our energy innovation, environmental, and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions. And, I hope that readers will be inspired to partner with us to innovate toward an even brighter future. Finally, I hope this report serves as a guide for future administrations in charting a course for our country's energy policies. MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY Dan R.

Indeed, these are the very solutions that the men and women of the National Laboratories are helping to advance every day through scientific R&D. DOE's laboratory system is the backbone of the United States' scientific research enterprise. Formed from strategic national investments in science during and following World War II, the National Laboratories form the most comprehensive research network of its kind in the world. For 75 years, they have delivered solutions to some of the most pressing national challenges, garnering 118 Nobel Prizes and discovering 22 elements on the periodic table along the way. While most of the National Laboratories' work is led by the Department's missions\u2014energy innovation, science discovery, nuclear security, and environmental cleanup\u2014they also represent a national resource and serve the national interest by addressing challenges extending beyond energy, and catalyzing research that spans across sectors. From furthering U.S. energy independence and leadership in clean technologies; to promoting innovation that advances U.S. economic competitiveness; to conducting research of the highest caliber in the physical, chemical, biological, materials, computational, and information sciences to advance understanding of the world around us\u2014 the Laboratories' purview is expansive and their contributions are indispensable. Building a Pipeline of Talent for Tomorrow At the core of the National Laboratories is a first- rate workforce of research scientists, engineers, and support personnel who are entrusted to serve the American people. Working separately and in tandem, the National Laboratories invest in growing the Nation's science and technology workforce. Building a talent pipeline has proven to be an invaluable investment that sets the National Laboratories apart from other Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and is part of how the Laboratories are able to maintain their innovative edge. A Structure to Enable Complex Problem-Solving The unique structure of the laboratory network\u2014 including 17 individual laboratories with distinct but complementary capabilities\u2014facilitates the \"big picture\" multidisciplinary investments and partnerships essential for large-scale, complex problem-solving. Scientists, engineers, technicians, and analysts collaborate throughout the system, as well as with academia and industry, helping to ensure the best solutions are pursued without regard to organizational boundaries. With their focus on mission-driven science and engineering, and the ultimate translation of basic science to technology development, the Laboratories fill an innovation ecosystem gap that bridges the work of universities and the private sector. Universities emphasize teaching and discovery science and typically focus on research by a single faculty member or small groups of faculty members. Industries, on the other hand, respond to market needs and focus their R&D on near-term solutions or the integration of multiple technologies. The Laboratories typically operate in the space in between, by concentrating on complex problems requiring sustained, long-term focus. Moreover, the Laboratories conduct R&D in some areas that are not pursued by either academia or industry, such as classified nuclear security work. A Critical Hub for Collaboration The types of partnerships that the Laboratories form are diverse\u2014spanning engagements with other federal agencies, academia, and the private sector. Partnerships allow the National Laboratories to serve as a key node in the R&D ecosystem and to EXECUTIVE SUMMARY8 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Editionintegrate fundamental advancements and applied precompetitive research outcomes with broad networks of expertise to address new challenges and critical national needs. Research partnerships vary in size and scope, ranging from small groups of investigators who conduct discovery science to address specific technical questions to large research centers that bring together dozens of experts from various disciplines and institutions to cooperatively address major research challenges. The act of bringing together top talent across the full spectrum of R&D performers, including universities, businesses, nonprofits, and National Laboratories, is a key function of the Department intended to enable collaboration and teamwork in its topical areas\u2014from artificial photosynthesis to energy storage through future battery technologies. For universities in particular, collaborating with National Laboratories enables them to conduct science that requires large, complex, and specialized facilities that are often far too resource-intensive for a university to maintain. For the private sector, these partnerships not only provide critical access to resources, but also expand the commercial impact of DOE research and accelerate taxpayer return on investment. Responding to the Urgent Needs of the Nation While long-term contributions are the predominant focus, the National Laboratories are also capable of responding with agility to emerging crises. As the national needs for innovation shift, DOE calls on the National Laboratories' unique scientific expertise, tools, facilities, and intellectual environments to respond quickly and with authority\u2014as was the case during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the National Virtual Biotechnology Laboratory (NVBL) established by DOE, the National Laboratories have collectively contributed to AI-informed epidemiological and molecular modeling, personal protective equipment supply chain challenges, the search for genomic clues, and other areas to support the Nation's (and world's) pandemic response. Specifically, the National Laboratories established the COVID-19 High-Performance Computing (HPC) Consortium to harness the world's most advanced computing capabilities in support of COVID-19 research. The advanced computing capabilities and systems made available through the Consortium processed massive numbers of calculations in support of studies related to bioinformatics and modeling, allowing scientists to significantly speed up their ability to answer complex scientific questions. Additionally, a Manufacturing Task Force consisting of 15 of the 17 National Laboratories was established to accelerate the development and deployment of new technologies into the U.S. manufacturing industrial base. Several National Laboratories also adopted a rapid licensing approach that transfers promising technologies to industry partners more quickly. The rapid licensing process allows for improved response to national emergencies and corresponding health and economic crises. Establishing the Nation's Scientific Leadership on the Frontiers of Discovery For 60 years, the National Laboratories have been key players in U.S. space activities, and that focus continues today. The multi-disciplinary expertise within the National Laboratories' community of researchers, coupled with decades of experience conducting \"science at scale,\" makes DOE and the National Laboratories uniquely suited to tackle the biggest challenges in space-related science, including establishing an expanded human presence in space and ensuring the unfettered ability to operate there by deterring, countering, and defeating space- oriented threats to U.S. security. Specifically, the National Laboratories' diverse expertise in fields like AI, advanced computing, materials science, systems biology, plasma science, space weather, radiation- tolerant microelectronics, and quantum information science enables the achievement of both increased scientific knowledge and an increased manned presence in space. Key to all of this is advancing space- capable energy technologies (nuclear and non-nuclear) and exploring innovative technologies for space\u2014which the Laboratories are doing today. Another frontier that the National Laboratories are exploring is that of quantum information science (QIS)\u2014a form of computing, sensing, and information processing that relies on quantum effects in order to sidestep traditional physical limitations of computing. In 2017, DOE began a series of investments to harness the unique expertise and capabilities of the National Laboratory complex to advance QIS for the benefit of the Nation. A notable milestone in this work was the quantum supremacy announcement of October 2019, which resulted from the collaboration of researchers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Google, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and a number of academic institutions. 9 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionConsensus is growing that using quantum mechanics to build a system to securely communicate and transmit information will be one of the most important technological breakthroughs of the 21st century\u2014 ushering in enormous benefits to national security, industry, and science. In July 2020, DOE released a Quantum Internet Blueprint that portrays a plan to develop a secure, reliable system initially connecting the National QIS Research Centers and ultimately the National Laboratory complex. In effect, DOE and the National Laboratories are bringing the United States to the forefront of the global quantum race. In tandem, ensuring the resilience of the Nation's energy infrastructure and enabling the widespread use of clean energy are critical focus areas for the National Laboratories. The Laboratories are advancing R&D on a number of fronts to make these goals possible. Those fronts include: Developing a wide array of energy storage resources to manage over 4 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity for the coming era of greater electrification; Reducing the cost of electrolyzers for hydrogen fuel cell technology in automobiles and other devices; Using AI to protect the energy system against cyber- attacks and blackouts; Designing clean power plants for the future that are fueled by coal, natural gas, biomass, and waste plastics and that incorporate technologies to capture, use and store carbon; and Accelerating the development of carbon-free energy from nuclear fusion for the private sector. A Vital Role\u2014Today and Tomorrow In summary, the National Laboratories are invaluable assets to the Department and our Nation. For 75 years, the National Laboratories have delivered tremendous scientific and technological impact against the United States' greatest national needs. Today, as America faces ever more pressing challenges of enormous complexity and scope, the National Laboratories' role is only more vital. 10 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Edition11 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Edition1.1 DOE at a Glance DOE is the lead Federal agency supporting fundamental R&D for major mission areas of energy innovation, science discovery, nuclear security, and environmental cleanup of legacy nuclear materials, and the Nation's largest supporter of basic research in the physical and computing sciences.

The Secretary is also supported by the Office of the Secretary, and the Office of Strategic Planning and Policy (OSPP). The energy innovation, science discovery, nuclear security, and environmental cleanup missions are carried out under the leadership of the three Under Secretaries: the Under Secretary of Energy, the Under Secretary for Science, and the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security. They manage the core functions that carry out the Department's missions, with significant cross-cutting work spanning the National Laboratory complex. The Under Secretary organizations are integral to ensuring that DOE line management has the resources and support needed to achieve mission objectives. The Under Secretaries oversee and manage Program Offices, which have diverse subject areas to support the DOE mission. The Under Secretary of Energy serves as the principal Under Secretary and the Department's principal advisor on energy policy, energy security, and applied technology R&D. The Under Secretary of Energy is focused on applied technologies that pertain to the operation and reliability of our Nation's energy infrastructure, thus positioning the Nation to become more energy independent and develop energy policies and programs that lower costs and maximize the use of resources. This Under Secretary manages DOE's three applied research laboratories and four Power Marketing Administrations. In addition, the Under Secretary of Energy is responsible for policy and oversight of safety, security, and project management across the DOE complex. The Under Secretary for Science serves as the Department's principal advisor on fundamental energy research, energy technologies, and science. This Under 1.

The Under Secretary for Science also leads the expanding DOE role in technology commercialization, especially for the National Laboratories. The Under Secretary for Nuclear Security also serves as the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Administrator, who leads the NNSA and its three core missions: maintaining the safety, security, and effectiveness of the nuclear stockpile; preventing, countering, and responding to proliferation and terrorism threats; and providing operational support for naval nuclear propulsion. As NNSA's mission continues to evolve to meet national security requirements, its workforce has adopted an enterprise-wide approach, instilling a culture of safety, efficiency, and effectiveness across all core mission areas. NNSA has a large civilian and contractor workforce, with locations at Headquarters in Washington DC as well as three National Laboratories, two Naval Reactors Laboratories (Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory and the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory), several production sites (Pantex Plant, Kansas City National Security Campus, Y-12 National Security Complex, and the Savannah River Site), and the Nevada Nuclear Security Site. The NNSA laboratories, plants, and sites, which are supported by FIGURE 1-1: THE ALIGNMENT OF THE DOE AND NATIONAL LABORATORY LEADERSHIP Figure 1-1 Footnote: This figure represents where each Laboratory falls within the broad DOE senior leadership structure. Please see Figure 4-1 for a full organization chart that includes other key positions involved in Laboratory oversight and direction.13 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Editionthe technical expertise resident throughout the DOE/ NNSA nuclear security enterprise, serve a mission- essential function, strengthening our nation through the nuclear security mission. DOE/NNSA keeps its technical expertise at the cutting edge in mission- essential functions such as manufacturing, diagnostics, and evaluation among many other such areas. DOE's Program Offices are an integral part of the Department and the strategic planning of the National Laboratories; their relationship to the Under Secretaries is shown in Figure 4-1 in Section 4. DOE's senior leaders are also responsible for the overall success and stewardship of the National Laboratory complex. As depicted in Figure 1-1, the 17 National Laboratories are managed by the three Under Secretaries to support coordination and strategic planning. However, the overall funding and operations of the laboratory complex are overseen by the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, with input from the Laboratory Operations Board (LOB) within the OSPP. The Department has approximately 13,000 Federal employees and more than 95,000 National Laboratory staff and contractor employees at 17 National Laboratories, five nuclear security plants and sites, and 16 environmental clean-up sites at 85 field locations in 30 States. DOE is proud to have a diverse workforce in various disciplines and fields, on which it relies to meet its broad mission. The Department continues to focus on the maintenance of a strong STEM workforce pipeline to support the future needs of our country. DOE's rich and diverse history is inextricably linked with the history of the National Laboratories and the evolution of science-based public policy. An in-depth history and description is available in a January 2017 document entitled Annual Report on the State of the DOE National Laboratories, available at https:/ /www. energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/02/f34/DOE%20 State%20of%20the%20National%20Labs%20 Report%2002132017.pdf. This 2020 report provides an update focused on the National Laboratories, their accomplishments, and events since 2017. 1.2 Overview of the National Laboratory System The 17 National Laboratories, which span the Nation geographically, provide a breadth and depth of scientific and technology leadership that is essential to America's scientific discovery and innovation (see Figure 1-2). The forerunners of the National Laboratories were created during the Manhattan Project of World War II to counter the existential threat facing the United States and its allies. After the war, the U.S. Government continued to invest significantly in S&T research, which grew the technical capabilities and facilities of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), created in 1946, and ultimately established the first Laboratories at AEC research sites. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 split the AEC into the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA); the National Laboratories were then managed by ERDA. In 1977, the Department of Energy Organization Act created DOE to replace ERDA and take on functions from several other agencies; this Act provided authorities that still broadly govern DOE's work today. Since 1946, the missions of DOE and the National Laboratories have evolved significantly to meet national needs. While most of the National Laboratories' work is guided by DOE's diverse missions, they are also a resource for the entire Federal government and for others. As such, the Laboratories engage in diverse partnerships and research collaborations with other Federal agencies, academia, and the private sector. Powering the National Laboratories is a world-class workforce of research scientists, engineers, and support personnel who serve the American people. Separately and together, the National Laboratories invest in growing the Nation's S&T workforce. Building a resilient talent pipeline has been imperative for the National Laboratories and has aided them in creating and maintaining an innovative edge.14 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionFIGURE 1-2: OVERVIEW OF THE NATIONAL LABORATORY SYSTEM IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY Idaho Falls, IDFERMILAB Batavia, IL ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY Lemont, ILBROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY Upton, NY PRINCETON PLASMA PHYSICS LABORATORY Princeton, NJ THOMAS JEFFERSON NATIONAL ACCELERATOR FACILITY Newport News, VA SAVANNAH RIVER NATIONAL LABORATORY Aiken, SCNATIONAL ENERGY TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY Pittsburgh, PA Morgantown, WV Albany, ORAMES LABORATORY Ames, IAPACIFIC NORTHWEST NATIONAL LABORATORY Richland, WA LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY Berkeley, CA SLAC NATIONAL ACCELERATOR LABORATORY Stanford, CA SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES Albuquerque, NM Livermore CALAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY Livermore, CA LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY Los Alamos, NMOAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY Oak Ridge, TN NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LAB Golden, CO 1.2.1 Types of DOE National Laboratories Each of the 17 National Laboratories varies in mission, capabilities, and structure. Figure 1-3 depicts the types of Laboratories and the range of research conducted at each. Additional detail and Laboratory-specific information is provided in Appendix A. Energy Technology Laboratories enhance DOE's energy mission and develop technologies that focus on different aspects of an \"all-of-the-above\" energy mission. Multipurpose Science Laboratories are home to unique research programs, core capabilities, and facilities that are key to multidisciplinary, crosscutting science. Single-Program Science Laboratories focus on discoveries in fundamental science and the forces in the universe. Multipurpose Security Laboratories are key to the nuclear security mission and principally work in classified space supporting the protection of the country through cutting-edge science and engineering. The Multipurpose Environmental Laboratory focuses on the environmental management and long-term stewardship missions of the Department. All but one of the National Laboratories are managed through a government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) model, which allows for competitively selected contractors to effectively operate the Laboratories and the investment of Laboratory R&D funding, while carrying out DOE's missions. The GOCO model also allows for a recompete process that enables DOE leadership to change the management and key personnel to improve contractor performance in support of strategic direction while maintaining the talented workforce. The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is the only government-owned, government-operated (GOGO) National Laboratory. 15 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Edition1.2.2 The National Laboratory Ecosystem and Adaptability The Laboratory system is constantly adapting to the evolving mission needs of the Department and ultimately, the Nation. DOE's National Laboratories are the crown jewels of the Nation's R&D ecosystem and serve as critical collaboration hubs for the scientific community. The Laboratories collaborate extensively with researchers and innovators from academia, industry, and other Federal agencies in discovery science and development of scientific and technological solutions that meet national needs. As the national needs for innovation shift, the National Laboratories adapt and fill in critical gaps, as shown in Figure 1-4. By concentrating on complex problems requiring sustained, long-term focus, the Laboratories typically operate in the space between universities' early discovery efforts and industry's focus on near- term solutions to meet market needs.FIGURE 1-3: TYPES AND RANGE OF DOE NATIONAL LABORATORIES 16 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionFIGURE 1-4: DOE NATIONAL LABORATORIES' INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM 1.2.3 The National Laboratories' Core Capabilities The National Laboratory complex functions as an interdependent system with an extensive set of core capabilities, world-class staff, and state-of-the art facilities and instrumentation.

While this section highlights three major areas that were critical to the Department's success since that time, a more in-depth and detailed sampling of S&T accomplishments by the National Laboratories is highlighted in Section 2 and DOE Accomplishments can be found in Appendix B. 1.3.1 The National Laboratory Response to Bio-threats such as COVID-19 When faced with an exigent need, DOE calls on the National Laboratories' unique scientific expertise, tools, facilities, and intellectual environments to respond quickly and with authority. This type of role for the Laboratories has been displayed recently as DOE has helped lead the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Partnerships between the National Laboratories and external partners advanced collaborative science for near-term solutions. The National Laboratories have collectively contributed to epidemiological research, molecular modeling, securing PPE supply chains, searching for genomic clues, and otherwise supporting the Nation's (and world's) pandemic response. The National Laboratories' collective rapid response efforts included the highly successful establishment of the COVID-19 HPC Consortium to harness the world's most advanced computing capabilities in support of COVID-19 research. The Consortium partners provided an unprecedented amount of computing power (330+ petaflops) to scientists and medical researchers as they responded to the global emergency. The Consortium includes Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL); Federal partners; industry; and academia. The NVBL's R&D Efforts that Helped Fight COVID-19: Epidemiological Modeling: improved U.S. policymakers' understanding of pandemic impacts and aided in the response efforts. A team of researchers developed an integrated COVID-19 pandemic monitoring, modeling, and analysis capability. This project takes advantage of National Laboratory supercomputers\u2014including the world's second most powerful\u2014along with other capabilities in scalable data and computing, spatial demography, and human dynamics research, along with economic and risk modeling. Manufacturing: minimized significant supply chain issues regarding critical medical supplies and equipment, especially PPE. Shortages in supplies such as N95 surgical masks and respirators, face shields, swabs, and ventilators put medical professionals at risk and delayed an effective response to the ongoing crisis. This project leveraged advanced manufacturing capabilities at the National Laboratories, including additive manufacturing processes for metals, composites, and polymers, to facilitate accelerated production of these items. Molecular Design for Medical Therapeutics: applied a combined computational and experimental approach to accelerate scientific discovery for therapeutics targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused COVID-19. This effort took advantage of the National Laboratory capabilities, including supercomputing and artificial intelligence, materials characterization at x-ray light and neutron sources, and nanoscience research. COVID-19 Testing R&D: discovered an effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and laboratory-based diagnostic tests that were critical for protecting vulnerable populations, managing risk to all populations, supporting work strategies, and tracking the evolution of the virus and disease. The R&D addressed the challenges of virus susceptibility, infection, and immunity. This project leveraged deep expertise at the National Laboratories in chemical analysis and biology to develop new approaches for improved diagnostic testing, including antigen and antibody testing. Viral Fate and Transport Research: supported experimentation combined with physics-based and data- driven modeling and simulation to address the challenge of SARS-CoV-2 transport, transmission, and fate. This research provided critical data and modeling results to influence the response to the crisis and helped understand factors involved in the emergence, circulation, and resurgence of pathogenic microbes.19 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Editionadvanced computing capabilities and systems made available through the Consortium processed enormous quantities of calculations for studies related to bioinformatics, epidemiology, and molecular modeling. These HPC resources allowed scientists to significantly speed up their ability to answer complex scientific questions related to COVID-19. As the United States began to see a dramatic increase in COVID-19 cases, the country experienced a material, manufacturing, and supply chain crisis associated with items needed to combat the pandemic. A Manufacturing Task Force, consisting of 15 of the 17 National Laboratories, was created to accelerate the development and deployment of new technologies into the U.S. manufacturing industrial base. The task force established a DOE strategy for mobilizing the manufacturing capabilities across the National Laboratories to develop, demonstrate, and make operational key technologies needed to address pandemic supply chain issues. The task force identified challenges and implemented rapid and effective solutions in days rather than weeks and months. Several National Laboratories also adopted a rapid licensing approach that transfers promising technologies to industry partners more quickly, which will benefit the Nation in the future during responses to national emergencies and corresponding health and economic crises. To respond to the current pandemic, and possible future pandemics, the Department's Office of Science (SC) instituted the NVBL to capitalize on the National Laboratories' world-leading expertise, capabilities, and facilities. Funded by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in March 2020, the NVBL takes advantage of DOE User Facilities, including light and neutron sources, nanoscale science centers, sequencing and bio-characterization facilities, and high-performance computers, to address key challenges in responding to pandemics. The NVBL allows for collaboration across the extraordinary breadth of bioscience and biotechnology expertise in the 17 DOE National Laboratories, in addition to collaboration with academia and industry. The NVBL framework provides the Department with a standing mechanism to quickly assess R&D needs associated with a rapidly evolving situation and identify critical capabilities existing within the National Laboratory system and DOE's broader research enterprise. This new framework will allow for the development of a multi-program and multi-institutional plan to deploy DOE's unique capabilities, and to coordinate efforts with other Federal agencies, state and local representatives, and partners in industry. 1.3.2 DOE and the National Laboratories' Role in Advancing U.S. Leadership in Space For decades, the United States has been the world's leading space power, with no equal in technical capability or operational presence. Over time, as with most of the world, the United States became crucially reliant on space systems. From economic prosperity and national security to science and diplomacy, space activities provide practical as well as symbolic benefits to the nation. But today, and for the foreseeable future, the United States will be facing a space environment that is increasingly more diverse and competitive, with an increasing number of space-faring nations and commercial entities, as well as countries such as China and Russia that are growing space threats pursuing their own commercial and military advantage in the space domain. In response, the 2020 U.S. National Space Policy calls for a reinvigorated, whole-of- nation approach to maintain and enhance America's leadership in space-based science, technology, commerce, and security. This includes the priorities of returning American astronauts to the Moon for the long term, followed by human exploration missions to Mars and beyond, to ensure an unfettered ability to operate Under a special project launched in May, a team of computing and bioinformatics experts at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory are working together to develop a platform that consolidates disparate COVID-19 data sources and uses the unified library to make predictions - about potential drug targets, for example.20 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Editionin space by deterring, countering, and defeating space- oriented threats to U.S. security and fostering the growth of space commerce. For 60 years, DOE and the National Laboratories have been key players in U.S. space activities. Through a multidisciplinary S&T workforce, combined with unique instruments and facilities, DOE and its Laboratories can address the types of large-scale, complex R&D challenges inherent in the future of U.S. space exploration, science, and commerce. The National Laboratories leverage their collaborative relationships with other U.S. government research centers, universities, and private sector entities to expand the foundations of space science knowledge and grow the U.S. space industry. While DOE is not unique in having this expertise, it is unique in the breadth of knowledge concentrated within a single organization and in the experience of applying that knowledge to a highly diverse mission set. DOE and the Laboratories are applying their core mission competencies and emerging capabilities to meet the needs of the U.S. space community in order to: Power the Exploration of Space: developing space- capable energy technologies (both nuclear and non- nuclear) for U.S. space customers, exploring energy management systems for their potential application to space missions, and considering innovative energy generation, collection, storage, distribution, employment, dissipation, and thermal management technologies for space systems. Solve the Mysteries of Space: harnessing the capabilities and expertise within the National Laboratory complex and across its broad community of researchers to make scientific discoveries for space and in space, advancing not only our fundamental understanding of the universe, but how we can live and work in it safely, securely, profitably, and productively. Support the Secure and Peaceful Use of Space: providing technical capabilities, systems, multi-purpose sensors, and satellite development/deployment support with application to national security as well as civil space programs. Enable the Development of Space: harnessing innovation to transform space science research and achieve breakthroughs in space-applicable technology to enable future U.S. space missions and grow U.S. space commerce.The Department's mission\u2014to address America's energy, environmental, and nuclear challenges through transformative S&T solutions\u2014simultaneously creates opportunities for DOE to advance American space innovation and drive American space exploration. DOE supports the world's most advanced and unique scientific facilities, which enable discoveries made possible by these facilities that push the boundaries of human knowledge across many scientific disciplines. For example, DOE provides expert knowledge and world-leading capabilities in nuclear and non-nuclear energy technologies, AI and robotics, high-speed information technology, advanced manufacturing, microelectronics, materials for extreme environments, radiation science, isotope production, and a host of other areas. This engine of discovery can power crewed missions to the Moon and beyond, as well as pave the way for human habitats and sustained presence on the surface of other planetary bodies. DOE is one of the largest supporters of technology transfer in the Federal government. Thus, DOE's R&D investments can aid in accelerating the commercialization and industrialization of space, forge new capabilities for sustainable expansion into the solar system, and provide benefits for life on Earth. For decades, the DOE innovation enterprise has worked with U.S. space programs in the design, development, and deployment of space nuclear power systems, having provided such power systems for nearly 30 missions over the past 60 years. This includes numerous Mars rovers, the Galileo mission to Jupiter, the Cassini mission to Saturn, and the Voyager and New Horizon missions to the outer edges of our solar system and beyond. DOE also supplied the power source, in addition to other essential equipment and technology, for the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover. But DOE and the National Laboratories have also partnered with the U.S. space community to develop many other enabling technologies and instruments, and has provided S&T resources for high-profile scientific missions such as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background mission, and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, experiments that have each made important contributions to our understanding of the nature of the universe, including dark matter and dark energy. DOE's cutting-edge work on next-generation computing technologies, such as QIS and AI, will help our Federal and private sector partners protect against space 21 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Editionweather events and debris. The DOE enterprise is also solving the mysteries of space and fostering technology development by expanding our understanding of the effects of harsh space environments on humans and materials, searching for dark energy, and exploring for past signs of life on Mars. And DOE is working closely with other United States government departments and agencies on S&T solutions to address asteroid deflection techniques for planetary defense, as well as strengthen U.S. satellite system resiliency and space situational awareness against space-based threats. The core expertise within DOE's community of researchers, coupled with decades of experience conducting \"science at scale,\" uniquely enables DOE to take on the biggest challenges in space-related science and an expanded human presence in space. Several National Laboratories already play major roles in space science research, including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). SLAC plays a development and operations role in the Fermi-Gamma Ray Telescope and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LBNL has the lead role for DOE in the Cosmic Microwave Background Experiment, and LANL developed the SuperCam, a remote-sensing spectroscopy instrument attached to the mast of the Perseverance rover due to land on Mars in February 2021, as well as the earlier ChemCam instrument on the Mars Curiosity rover. The goal of an expanded human presence in space is an extraordinary opportunity to pursue completely new opportunities for science and technological research across many domains. DOE's diverse expertise in fields like AI, advanced computing, materials science, systems biology, plasma science, space weather, radiation-tolerant microelectronics, and QIS enable the achievement of both increased scientific knowledge and an increased human presence in space. In addition, DOE's NNSA has unique capabilities to assist with national defense through its treaty monitoring, indications, and warning programs; national defense of its space assets, such as satellites; and global defense, including planetary defense from near- Earth objects. SNL and LANL have been key technical partners in the nearly 60-year partnership between the U.S. Air Force and NNSA on the U.S. Nuclear Detection System to develop, test, produce, and integrate nuclear detonation detection instrument payloads onto global positioning system satellites and other satellite hosts to monitor compliance with international bans on atmospheric, space, and underwater nuclear testing. Both LANL and SNL have advanced technologies for nuclear detonation detection instruments that improve system performance to meet changing national needs. Researchers at LLNL are using computer simulations to validate their ability to accurately simulate how an Earth-bound asteroid may be deflected, an essential component of the design of a modeling plan for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission in 2021, which will be the first-ever kinetic impact deflection demonstration on a near-Earth asteroid. 1.3.3 DOE's Role in the Future of Quantum Information Science QIS, which is a form of computing and information processing that relies on quantum effects in order to sidestep traditional physical limitations of computing, has emerged as a critical technology of the future. QIS builds on uniquely quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and squeezing to obtain and process information in ways that cannot be achieved according to classical physics. With broad-ranging applications in sensing and metrology, networking, simulation, and computing, QIS has the potential to enable significant advances in critical areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science. At the same time, research in the theoretical foundations of QIS is opening new areas of science discovery and technology innovation. Los Alamos National Laboratory's SuperCam on the Mars Perseverance rover - a remote-sensing instrument for the Mars 2020 mission. 22 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionQIS is on the threshold of providing transformative technology that will impact discovery science and technological innovation in the coming decades. Advances in QIS are critical to data protection and our national competitiveness in information technology. America continues to lead in QIS and emerging technologies, but competitor nations, like China, have made QIS a top investment priority with a goal of surpassing the United States. The race for leadership in quantum technologies will be a determinative factor in the competitiveness of future advanced economics. This is a race we cannot afford to lose. To support this effort, President Trump signed the bipartisan, bicameral National Quantum Initiative Act in December 2018, which established a coordinated multiagency program to support research and training in QIS, encompassing activities at the DOE, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). Consistent with this initiative, the President launched the National Quantum Strategy, which positions the U.S. to achieve success by leveraging the combined strengths of academia, industry, and the DOE Laboratories to drive QIS breakthroughs. The National Laboratories are well aligned with the National Quantum Strategy, which provides the framework and direction to pursue DOE's strategic objectives: Science: DOE programs and laboratory-directed research and development (LDRD) funds support an expansive research portfolio across the complex. A notable highlight is the quantum supremacy announcement of October 2019, which resulted from the collaboration of researchers from ORNL, Google, NASA, and a number of academic institutions. ORNL's Summit, the Nation's fastest supercomputer, was used in this demonstration to compete with Google's quantum computer. Workforce: The DOE National Laboratories support QIS careers via training programs and summer schools such as LANL's Quantum Computing Summer School Fellowship. Additionally, DOE programs like the Office of Science Graduate Student Research Program (SCGSR) and Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (CSGF) allow students to leverage Laboratory resources during their graduate training. Industry: The Laboratories collaborate with the industry to advance QIS and technology via research partnerships and User Facilities that make Laboratory capabilities available to industry. The Laboratories also connect the broader scientific community with industry. For instance, ORNL's quantum computing user program provides the scientific community with access to quantum computing resources from IBM, D-Wave, Rigetti, and Atos. Infrastructure: The User Facilities at the Laboratories, including x-ray light sources and supercomputers, are already being used for QIS-related research. Development of specific technologies such as superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities for qubits at FNAL and investments at the Nanoscale Science Research Centers add advanced capabilities for QIS. Economic and Security: Foundational research at the Laboratories provides a base for future technologies. Exploration of technology at the precompetitive level, such as quantum testbeds at LBNL and SNL funded by DOE-SC, mitigates risk for industry.DOE and the National Laboratories' Pivotal Role in Quantum Internet: Around the world, consensus is building that a system to communicate using quantum mechanics represents one of the most important technological frontiers of the 21st century. DOE released a Quantum Internet Blueprint in July 2020 that presents a plan to develop a secure and reliable system initially connecting the National QIS Research Centers and ultimately the National Laboratory complex. The plan is based on the experience and expertise of testbed networks established by the ANL-FNAL-University of Chicago collaboration and the BNL-Stony Brook University collaboration. DOE is proud to play an instrumental role in the development of the national quantum internet and by constructing this new and emerging technology, the United States continues with its commitment to maintain and expand our quantum capabilities. DOE's Laboratories will serve as the backbone of the coming quantum internet, which will rely on the laws of quantum mechanics to control and transmit information more securely than ever before. Currently in its initial stages of development, the quantum internet could become a secure communications network with a profound impact on areas critical to science, industry, and national security. DOE and the National Laboratories are bringing the United States to the forefront of the global quantum race and ushering in a new era of secure communications.23 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Edition International: The Laboratories play an active role in the international QIS community. In addition to forging research partnerships, many Laboratory researchers serve on international scientific advisory boards. As DOE continues to establish its leadership in QIS, the National Laboratories remain strongly vested in future QIS advances via awarded and planned efforts. The Laboratories bring their extensive resources and expertise to the field and, in some cases, supplement DOE's investments with their internal initiatives. The National Quantum Initiative Act called for the creation of competitively awarded QIS research centers. Five of the Laboratories lead the National QIS Research Centers that were established in August 2020; those Laboratories are ANL, BNL, FNAL, LBNL, and ORNL. These Centers constitute DOE's largest investment to date in QIS and across the technical breadth of DOE-SC. They span a wide scope within QIS that includes communication, computing/ emulation, devices/sensors, materials/chemistry, and foundries, and they address all levels of the QIS S&T innovation chain from fundamental science to devices, systems, prototypes, and applications. While led by the DOE National Laboratories, the Centers engage academia and industry as participating partners and have innovative workforce advancement programs. In summary, the DOE National Laboratories host the scientific User Facilities and multi-laboratory initiatives that are strongly embedded in the nationwide QIS ventures. This robust ecosystem, combined with DOE's strategic investments in core QIS research, as well as in the National QIS Research Centers and the proposed quantum internet, is expected to bring additional benefits to the American people. \\ DOE's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is using a sophisticated cooling system to keep qubits - the heart of quantum computers - cold enough for scientists to study them for future use in quantum computers. 24 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Edition25 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionThe contributions of the National Laboratories span the spectrum from discovery science to development of advanced technology.

Annual Laboratory solicitations provide additional flexibility and allow DOE's applied energy technology offices to directly fund core and enabling S&T capabilities. These solicitations are often used to encourage inter- Laboratory collaboration and bigger consortia-like projects where Laboratories combine enabling capabilities to accomplish challenging multiyear goals. The DOE National Laboratories participate in cross- disciplinary work in strategic partnerships projects, commercialization, or transferring appropriate technologies to industry, academia, and other partners.3.1.1 Partnering of National Laboratories and Other Entities through Research Centers, Hubs, and Institutes To effectively partner with external entities, the National Laboratories use Research Centers, Hubs, and Institutes such as: Bioenergy Research Centers (BRCs): BRCs are accelerating the transformational scientific breakthroughs necessary for cost-effective production of biofuels and bioenergy, including cellulosic ethanol. These centers bring together researchers from National Laboratories, industry, and academia to conduct comprehensive, multidisciplinary research into microbes and plants in an effort to develop innovative biotechnology solutions for energy production. DOE Innovation Hubs: First established in 2010 and modeled on the proactive approach to science management exemplified by the Manhattan Project and AT&T's legendary Bell Laboratories, the DOE Energy Innovation Hubs are integrated, multidisciplinary research centers that combine basic and applied research with engineering to accelerate scientific discovery and address critical energy issues. The act of bringing together top talent across the full spectrum of R&D performers, including universities, private industry, nonprofits, and National Laboratories, is intended to enable each Hub to function as a world- leading R&D center in its topical area. The mission of these Hubs is to advance promising areas of energy science and engineering from the earliest stages of research to the point of commercialization. 3. HOW THE NATIONAL LABORATORIES WORK WITH THE INNOVATION COMMUNITY32 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionEnergy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs): The EFRC program brings together researchers from multiple disciplines and institutions, including universities, National Laboratories, industry, and nonprofit organizations. The program combines them into synergistic, highly productive teams to address fundamental science questions that must be solved in order to remove roadblocks to transformational energy technologies. Their \"use-inspired\" discovery science is motivated by the need to solve a specific problem, such as energy storage, photoconversion, or cost-effective techniques for carbon dioxide sequestration. Manufacturing Innovation Institutes (MIIs): The MIIs include 14 public-private partnerships established between DOE and other federal agencies as part of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI). NNMI brings together industry, academia, National Laboratories, and state and local economic and workforce development stakeholders to revitalize America's manufacturing industry. This network of regional \"ecosystems\" combines public and private resources to: develop advanced technologies that help U.S. manufacturers achieve a competitive advantage in global markets, attract private industry to site future manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and create a talent pipeline needed to support the growth of U.S. manufacturing. DOE and the National Laboratories have collaborated with the MIIs by partnering as members of the R&D network within MIIs as well as establishing four MIIs to support advanced manufacturing and other initiatives. 3.1.2 Partnering with Academia The National Laboratories engage in important partnerships with universities through avenues such as personnel exchanges, research collaborations at the individual investigator level, joint research programs established to develop and take advantage of DOE User Facilities, and strategic institutes that focus on new areas of scientific endeavor. Collaborating with National Laboratories provides universities with the ability to conduct science that requires: Large, complex facilities and teams trained in their safe and effective operation, such as the Advanced Photon Source at ANL, the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider at BNL, the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL, and a dozen other facilities; Substantial engineering and instrument development, such as the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL); or Specialized facilities that are challenging to maintain, such as the Combustion Research Facility at SNL. These collaborations provide opportunities for interdisciplinary research, professional development, and training to achieve goals that benefit the Nation. Indeed, every year over 2,000 graduate students make use of Laboratory facilities in order to carry out their research, enabling a pipeline of scientific talent with broad benefit to the Nation's S&T capacity. The National Laboratories also subcontract with educational institutions. This provides the Laboratories with an additional avenue for education and training, and also represents a substantial flow of DOE resources to the academic research community. The National Laboratories collectively subcontract more than $500 million annually to universities and employ more than 8,500 students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty in a typical year. This subcontracted research is in addition to the more than $900 million that DOE directly provides each year to universities through academic research grants. This demonstrates how tightly interwoven the Laboratories and universities are within the national research ecosystem and how they are building the next generation of a STEM workforce with DOE support.DOE's Four Innovation Hubs: Critical Materials Institute: Developing solutions for rare earth elements and other materials critical to a growing number of energy technologies. Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis: Conducting advanced research to produce fuels directly from sunlight. Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR): Establishing a science-based underpinning for future battery technologies for transportation and the grid. National Alliance for Water Innovation (NAWI): Conducting research on desalination and associated water-treatment technologies to secure affordable and energy-efficient water supplies from nontraditional water sources.33 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Edition3.1.3 Partnering among National Laboratories The National Laboratories maintain a critical role in the energy innovation ecosystem by addressing complex, multidisciplinary problems with long time horizons, using their combination of unique facilities and expertise. Since 2017, DOE has worked to more strategically engage the Laboratory system and its unique resources in focusing on large-scale, impactful initiatives. In addition to participation in the broader U.S. innovation ecosystem that includes universities, businesses, and Federal R&D partners, the National Laboratories also collaborate with one another, leveraging their various strengths as a cohesive system that flexibly responds to major challenges. Indeed, the National Laboratories increasingly rely on one another's capabilities for the design and construction of state- of-the-art facilities. Three examples of collaboration among the Laboratories are inter-entity work orders (IEWOs), the NLDC, and the Oppenheimer Science and Energy Leadership Program (OSELP). IEWOs are used for a wide array of collaborations between the Laboratories, including R&D, partnership on scientific construction projects, software development, materials testing and characterization, engineering analysis and design, and project management reviews. They enable the transfer of funds and work scope between Laboratory partners without the need for separate agreements between DOE and each partner Laboratory. In FY 2019, more than $600 million was transferred between the National Laboratories and production facilities through IEWOs.1 The NLDC is a self-organized, self-governing body composed of the directors of all 17 Laboratories. The NLDC advances the effectiveness of the Laboratory complex in addressing national needs and provides an interface to DOE on issues and concerns of common interest. The NLDC provides a forum for presenting the Secretary of Energy and DOE senior management with consensus views on matters that affect the Laboratories and their ability to contribute to the DOE mission. In addition, the NLDC has established standing working groups, made up of the most senior operational and scientific leaders at the Laboratories that are a key mechanism for coordinating across the National Laboratory complex on matters ranging from scientific directions to operational issues and requirements. The NLDC and its working groups are a critical resource available to DOE that can help inform strategy and policy. OSELP is an annual Fellowship program created by DOE and the NLDC to develop and retain emerging laboratory leaders. OSELP Fellows are recommended by a distinguished panel of current and former Laboratory and DOE leaders and ultimately selected by the NLDC. These Fellows are encouraged to explore the complexities, challenges, and opportunities facing the National Laboratory system and DOE. Through site visits and development of strategic think-pieces that are presented annually to the NLDC, the Fellows are immersed in the breadth, diversity, and complexity of the Laboratories, DOE, and their partners. OSELP represents a collective commitment from the Laboratories to cultivate the leaders needed to sustain long-term impacts throughout the complex. In 2020, the NLDC expanded the Oppenheimer program by creating the Oppenheimer Leadership Network, a formal network of OSELP alumni to serve as an intellectual resource to support the current leadership teams in stewarding the Laboratory complex into the future. 3.2 Transferring Technologies to Innovation Partners DOE and the National Laboratories are focused on the transition of technology, specifically recognizing the multiple, interlinked connections among different stages of research and demonstration that are needed to reach commercial impact. DOE's Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) facilitates these connections by fostering programs and initiatives that guide interactions between DOE, the National Laboratories, and the private sector in collaborative research, strategic partnerships, facilities access, and technology transfer. OTT's mission is to expand the commercial impact of DOE's R&D portfolio to advance U.S. economic, energy, and security interests. It carries out its mission by examining current programs and practices, analyzing areas of need and additional focus, and proposing new programs and mechanisms to enhance the impact of DOE investments. Complementary to OTT, NNSA features the Office of Strategic Partnership Programs, which has a mission to develop and maintain partnerships with both Federal and non-Federal entites to help sustain the Nation's nuclear deterrent and broader national security 1The $600 million does not include transactions with NETL or Thomas Jefferson National Accelator Facility (JLab) due to differing accounting 34 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Editionmission. While the office maintains its focus on NNSA National Laboratories, Plants, and Sites, it partners with OTT for agency-wide programs. 3.2.1 Innovation/Entrepreneurial and Laboratory-to-Market Activities DOE fosters programs and initiatives that guide interactions between the National Laboratories and its technology partners. In recent years, DOE has explored several new avenues to increase the National Laboratories' ability to move technologies from a laboratory setting to the marketplace by equipping each Laboratory and their researchers with the appropriate tools and resources. For example, many Laboratories have entrepreneurial leave programs for Laboratory staff and researchers who want to pursue joining or starting businesses that will move National Laboratory-developed technologies into the marketplace. These leave programs allow enterprising researchers to test the waters and enable more commercialization pathways through technology transfer, with the potential outcome of leaving the Laboratory for a successful venture or returning to the Laboratory with the rich experience of having participated in a start-up or tech venture. Another example is the Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP), which takes top entrepreneurial scientists and engineers and embeds them within U.S. National Laboratories to perform early-stage R&D that may lead to the launch of energy or manufacturing businesses in the future. This dual focus on early-stage R&D and entrepreneurial development provides innovators with the platform they need to take their ideas from the Laboratory and onto the commercialization pathway. Examples of successful LEEP programs include: Cyclotron Road: Based out of LBNL, this program supports leading entrepreneurial scientists as they advance technology projects with the potential for global impact. For two years, a cohort of entrepreneurial scientists and engineers from around the world are embedded in the Berkeley research ecosystem, where they are provided with funding, access, training, and mentorship to mature their ideas from concept to first product, positioning them to align with the most suitable commercial path to bring their technology to scale. Chain Reaction Innovations (CRI): Based out of ANL, this is a two-year program for innovators focusing on energy and science technologies. Program participants receive the financial and technical support needed to perform early-stage R&D that may launch energy or manufacturing businesses in the future. CRI teaches the best and brightest from across the nation the entrepreneurship skills needed to develop transformative cleantech and innovations in advanced manufacturing. Innovation Crossroads: Based out of ORNL, this two-year program, leverages ORNL's unique scientific resources and capabilities and connects the nation's top innovators with experts, mentors, and networks in technology-related fields to take world-changing ideas from research and development to the marketplace. Participants receive a fellowship that covers living costs and benefits, a travel stipend, a substantial grant to use on collaborative research and development work at ORNL, and comprehensive assistance to build a sustainable business model. These Laboratory-based programs are crucial in supporting and encouraging innovation throughout the Laboratory system. In addition, there are many other DOE entrepreneurial programs that are worth highlighting, such as: Energy I-Corps: This program equips National Laboratory researchers with tools to understand the real-world relevance of their technologies, inform future research initiatives, and identify viable pathways to market for laboratory-developed technologies. The program builds entrepreneurial skills by pairing Laboratory researchers with industry mentors who have substantial expertise in a relevant sector. Each mentorship team participates in an intensive two-month training program that includes lectures, Energy I-Corps Success: In the first nine Energy I-Corps cohorts, 101 teams from 11 National Laboratories participated in the program. Initially, $8 million in funds for the program were provided by DOE technology offices, National Laboratories, and industry, and resulted in almost $32 million in follow-on funding for, and six new companies based on, Energy I-Corps technologies. During the cohorts, teams participated in more than 7,000 customer discovery interviews that were conducted with companies such as Hitachi, Lowes, Johns Manville, Lego, Trane, Tesla, GM, Dow Chemical, Yingli, Whirlpool, GE, Home Depot, ReMax, and Amazon.2 2https:/ /energyicorps.energy.gov/sites/default/files/Nov%202019_BR_Energy%20I-Corps_View%20File.pdf35 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Editionworkshops, and customer discovery interviews to enable the refinement of their unique value proposition. Energy I-Corps has benefited researchers across the entire complex. Energy I-Corps Satellite Programs: These Laboratory-led commercialization training programs equip researchers with the information and skills they need to effectively work with private-sector partners to commercialize DOE-funded technologies. Each participating Laboratory develops a short- course version of the Energy I-Corps program that is customized for their unique needs. This program enables DOE to extend the reach of the Energy I-Corps training platform: While the full Energy I-Corps program serves 20-30 teams per year, more than 200 teams participate in Energy I-Corps Satellite Programs annually, with many continuing to participate in the full Energy I-Corps program or other opportunities offered by OTT. U.S. Government's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology (STTR) programs: In FY 2021, SBIR and STTR partnered with OTT to develop a new commercialization training for DOE SBIR/STTR Phase 1 awardees seeking to maximize the commercial potential of their research. This new training incorporates elements of the Energy I-Corps curriculum with a focus on helping awardees prepare commercialization plans for strong SBIR Phase 2 proposals and beyond. Participants are mentored by veteran program instructors who have broad experience in successfully transitioning SBIR/ STTR Phase 1 projects to Phase 2, as well as a practical understanding of the commercialization process such as ecosystem development, go-to-market strategies, market and customer discovery, and resources and partnership opportunities. FedTech: This private venture program connects entrepreneurs to technologies developed across Federal agencies such as DOE, the Department of Defense (DoD), NASA, the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the Department of Treasury (DOT); universities; corporate R&D arms; and other laboratories. FedTech, with its extensive network of incubators, accelerators, and entrepreneur networks, leads multiple cohorts annually that provide opportunities to pair DOE technologies and inventors with entrepreneur applicants. Through its startup studio and other programs, FedTech employs the \"lean\" startup business model to position the technology partners to successfully launch a venture around the technology. Technologist in Residence (TIR) Program: The TIR program is a DOE initiative that strengthens America's competitiveness by streamlining engagement and increasing collaborative early-stage R&D between National Laboratories and industry. The program involves the competitive selection of pairs consisting of a senior technical staff member from a National Laboratory (\"lab technologist\"), and a senior technical staff member from industry, a consortium of companies, or a state or regional economic development entity (\"industry technologist\"). These pairs of technologists work together for 18 to 24 months to accomplish several goals: Identify the participating company's technical priorities and challenges, and the resources and capabilities across the National Laboratories that may be suitable to address them; Propose collaborative R&D efforts to develop science-based solutions to the company's most strategic scientific, technological, and business issues; and Establish a general framework agreement and begin developing specific scopes of work for the proposed collaborative R&D efforts. The proposed R&D then takes place outside of the program and does not use TIR Program funds.Energy I-Corps cohorts met via Teams in 2020, but these enterprising researchers from several labs benefited from industry mentors and business development training. 36 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionTech-to-Market (T2M): DOE's ARPA-E leads a T2M program that provides resources and guidance to help researchers obtain strategic market insights needed to create innovative and commercially relevant technologies. The program provides support and management to project teams with a goal of better aligning technologies with market needs. It also assists teams in engagements with third-party investors and partners to support technology development toward identified market applications. 3.2.2 Technology Maturation An enduring challenge for any institution seeking to move technologies from the laboratory to the marketplace is the ability to obtain resources for technology maturation. As the National Laboratories tend to focus on longer-term challenges rather than near-term solutions, many technologies still require investment and development before they can be demonstrated and validated within a particular market application. This dynamic presents risk for industry partners seeking to transfer and commercialize National Laboratory technologies. DOE and the Laboratories have taken significant steps toward addressing this challenge: Technology Commercialization Fund (TCF): Authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 Sec. 1001(e), the TCF bridges a financial gap to facilitate promising energy technologies developed from DOE investment at the National Laboratories. In FY 2020, the TCF reached $33 million in available funds and supported 82 projects at 11 Laboratories involving dozens of private-sector partners. The TCF supports projects that focus on maturing unlicensed Laboratory-developed technologies identified as having commercial potential and needing additional maturation to attract a private partner. This fund also supports cooperative development projects that focus on a Laboratory-developed technology in collaboration with a private partner for its commercial application. NNSA Technology Maturation Grants Program: In FY 2020, NNSA initiated the Technology Maturation Grants Program to identify technologies that support the nuclear stockpile and have commercialization value, help mature low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies past the \"valley of death,\" and facilitate technologies' connection to stockpile stewardship. Through a proposal process, the program selects and funds a small number of technologies that clearly demonstrate future benefit to NNSA defense programs and whose commercialization potential has been endorsed by the affiliated National Laboratory's technology transfer office. Internal Technology Maturation Programs: The majority of National Laboratories operate their own technology maturation programs that use internal resources, typically royalty funds, to advance technologies with commercial potential. Each Laboratory structures its program to fit its particular circumstances, with the ultimate goal of commercializing technology. 3.2.3 Contracting and Liability Reform The Laboratory Agreement Processing Reform effort streamlines the ability of National Laboratory contractors to enter into certain partnership agreements within a DOE-approved portfolio of routine work through the use of a Master Scope of Work (MSW). The MSW process allows the DOE contracting officer for a National Laboratory or DOE Site to approve an MSW needed for routine work with non-federal parties. The contracting officer places the work and funding onto the contract as required for all work at the facility, using standard contracting procedures, but with a significantly shorter processing time. In addition, the Liability Reform effort provides more flexibility for National Laboratories to address indemnity requirements, a common barrier to private-sector interaction, making it easier for National Laboratories to partner with business and industry by tailoring associated risk to the specific circumstances. 3.2.4 Increased Access to the Laboratory System In recent years, DOE has launched programs that better enable external partners to access the unique capabilities, expertise, and facilities at the National Laboratories, to help the partners overcome immediate technical challenges within the innovation ecosystem, establish new technology-based offerings, address TIR Program Success: To date, DOE has funded 15 TIR pairs involving eight National Laboratories. Industry partners have included Cummins, DuPont, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Honeywell UOP, Proctor & Gamble, and others.3 3https:/ /www.energy.gov/eere/amo/technologist-residence-program37 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: EditionFocus of Successful X-Lab Summits from 2018- 2020: CarbonX Summit (October 2020, hosted by NETL): Technologies and capabilities that are transforming the domestic energy economy by enabling value- added products, environmentally conscious storage, and economical carbon dioxide capture.

Innovation X-Lab Summits: Through OTT, DOE sponsors events that facilitate the exchange of information and ideas among industry, universities, manufacturers, investors, end-use customers, and innovators and experts from the National Laboratories and broader DOE R&D complex. The goals of the events are to: Catalyze public-private partnerships and commercial handoffs using DOE's extensive assets: technology, intellectual property, facilities, and world-leading scientists and researchers; Engage the private sector to ensure DOE understands industry's technical needs, risk appetite, and investment criteria, thereby incorporating \"market pull\" into DOE's portfolio planning; and Inform DOE R&D planning to increase commercialization possibilities. These events highlight promising technologies from across the Laboratory complex and facilitate connections and commercialization opportunities at the decision-maker level. In preparation for the Summits, OTT creates topic-specific communication materials4 to better inform potential collaborators and investors of the National Laboratories' capabilities, expertise, and prior accomplishments. This includes success stories and other resources that highlight significant public-private engagements, DOE programs, and funding opportunities designed to keep the United States at the forefront of rapidly developing technology areas. DOE National Lab Days: These events are hosted by academia to learn about and explore opportunities for partnerships with the National Laboratory system. They bring together students, researchers from regional industry and small businesses, and National Laboratory scientists and leaders. National Lab Days showcase the work of the Laboratories and enable the community to learn about the facilities and expertise available to support research, technology development, and education and discover how to engage with the Laboratories. Past events have been hosted by University of Alaska Fairbanks, University of Toledo, and Montana Technological University. The University of New Hampshire pivoted to a virtual format in the fall of 2020 by hosting a series of webinars on specific topics such as transformative manufacturing and career- building opportunities at the National Laboratories with additional webinars continuing in 2021. Lab Partnering Service (LPS): This is an online, single- access-point platform that investors, innovators, and institutions can use to obtain information from the DOE Leadership at Innovation Lab summits, which facilitate a two-way exchange of information and ideas between industry, universities, manufacturers, investors, and end-use customers with innovators and experts from across the National Labs and broader DOE R&D complex. 4https:/ /www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/resources/success-stories-technology-spotlights38 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionNational Laboratories about their myriad capabilities. It enables fast discovery of expertise, technologies, and facilities, and it serves as a conduit between investor and innovators by providing multi-faceted search capabilities across numerous disciplines at the Laboratories. Its functions include an expert search, technical summaries, facility locator, visual patent search, and developer application programming interface. The LPS helps companies decide where to partner or invest by helping them identify experts in their fields of interest and providing a searchable database of National Laboratory technologies that are available for licensing. Solutions Exchange Program: DOE's OTT launched the Solutions Exchange Program pilot to help U.S. businesses solve scientific challenges. Within the pilot program, businesses share specific technical challenges and partnership interests with OTT, which are discreetly communicated across the National Laboratory network to identify potential solutions. 3.2.5 Fostering Multi-Laboratory Technology Transfer Programs Beyond R&D collaborations among multiple National Laboratories, DOE has created opportunities to streamline the lab-to-market process by promoting cooperation among the Laboratories' technology transfer organizations to leverage their collective strengths. One such opportunity is the Practices to Accelerate the Commercialization of Technologies (PACT) program, which promotes the transition of research developed at the Laboratories toward the marketplace. The most-recent PACT solicitation sought projects designed to develop new ways to increase technology commercialization by reducing barriers to accessing the National Laboratories' capabilities, lowering transaction costs, and improving the complex's ability to serve the private sector effectively. The selected projects engage all 17 National Laboratories, one NNSA Plant and 23 other partners. A few examples of these efforts include the Accelerating Commercialization by Connecting Laboratory Inventions to Maturation (ACCLAIM) project, Cybersecurity Technology Concentration and Commercialization project, the Diversity and Inclusion in InVentorship and EntrepReneurship Strategies and Engagement - Women (DIVERSE-W), the CMI- developed technologies project, and the Technology Transfer Researcher Liaison Program. 3.3 International Partnerships and Engagements Scientific output continues to expand internationally, and many of the challenges that DOE researchers are working to overcome are global in scale. In an increasingly interconnected world, technological advancements and shifting policies can have profound impacts on global energy systems and other critical (and sometimes shared) systems. DOE and the National Laboratories are also mindful of the need to protect critical emerging technologies, and are implementing measures to do so. The National Laboratories also recognize the tremendous benefits to the U.S. from active engagement in international collaborations and are working with DOE and other agencies to ensure the proper balance. DOE has longstanding cooperative agreements, such as CRADA and ACT, with international partners in all mission areas and continues to establish new international collaborations in a strategic manner to achieve R&D goals, while protecting the Nation's competitive position and national security in areas DOE National Laboratories Partner with ExxonMobil for $100 Million in Joint Research: In 2019, a major 10-year technology transfer agreement valued at $100 million was executed between DOE's National Renewable Enery Laboratory (NREL), NETL, and ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil's investment in the Laboratories provided the ability to study advancement in lower-emissions energy technologies that could be brought to commercial scale. This agreement is one of the largest public-private partnerships between DOE laboratories and the private sector, and exemplifies DOE's commitment to cross-cutting, result-driven research initiatives. This successful agreement was a direct result of the TriLab conference, which was organized by the Deputy Secretary in July 2018 to bring together leadership and technical experts from DOE's program offices, and applied energy Laboratories. Speakers and participants also included private sector participants, including ExxonMobil. The TriLab conference discussed R&D challenges and opportunities for the applied laboratories to work together in order to advance the nation's energy system; to achieve a resilient, reliable, affordable, and technically leading energy system to serve the Nation for the next century. 39 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Editionof advanced innovation. Examples of international partnerships include the following: In 2016, DOE and FNAL developed an international CRADA, I-CRADA, as a first-of-a-kind agreement between a National Laboratory and a scientific research organization of another nation. The agreement was first implemented for a partnership between FNAL and the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Particle Physics at the Terascale (CoEPP), which focused on the mutual exchange of expertise in particle physics. The agreement included cooperation in theoretical particle physics, accelerator physics, computing, and experimental areas such as neutrino physics. One of LLNL's largest technology transfer projects was completed under an ACT with the Czech Republic, in which LLNL completed the design, development, and construction of an advanced petawatt (quadrillion-watt) laser system for the European Union's Extreme Light Infrastructure Beamlines facility. The laser system, known as L3-HAPLS, went into operation in 2018. Types of Partnership Agreement Mechanisms: CRADAs: A CRADA is a legal agreement that allows collaborative R&D work between the Federal government, its laboratories, and nonfederal partners to optimize resources, share technical expertise in a protected environment, access intellectual property emerging from the effort, and advance the commercialization of federally developed technologies. The participants collaborate by providing personnel, services, facilities, or equipment and pool the results from a particular R&D program. SPPs: SPPs permit DOE Laboratories to conduct work for other Federal agencies and nonfederal entities on a 100% cost-reimbursable basis. This work uses Laboratory personnel and/or facilities; pertains to the mission of the Laboratory; does not conflict or interfere with the achievement of DOE program objectives; does not place the Laboratory in direct competition with the domestic private sector; and does not create a potential future burden on DOE resources. Agreement for Commercializing Technology (ACT): This is a contract that a DOE M&O contractor negotiates and enters into directly with partners. ACT contracts allow research and technology transfer projects with more-flexible intellectual property arrangements and other terms and conditions used more traditionally in industry agreements, including fixed pricing, advance payments, and performance guarantees. SBIR and STTR: These are two U.S. Government programs where DOE programs can set aside a fraction of their funding to be competitively awarded to small businesses to perform R&D projects. The small businesses are encouraged to commercialize the technology, and they retain the rights to technology that they develop. Technology Licensing Agreements (TLAs): These agreements provide commercialization rights to patented and/ or copyrighted intellectual property (IP) developed at the National Laboratories, which is normally held and licensed by the M&O contractor. Because of the laws and policies governing the licensing of federally funded research and DOE policies regarding IP, TLAs may include provisions such as march-in-rights, government use rights, and indemnification provisions. Technical Assistance Agreements (TAAs): These agreements allow Laboratory scientists and engineers to help members of the small business community solve important challenges at no or reduced cost to the small business. Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs): MTAs protect biological materials and tangible research products provided to or by the Laboratory from further transmittal. The agreement normally requires return or destruction of materials and products at the end of the agreement. User Agreements: These specialized, standard agreements expedite access to DOE scientific user facilities. DOE operates scientific and engineering User Facilities integral to the mission of the DOE and the host laboratory. Each User Facility manages its allocation of facility resources, typically granting access to funds through merit review of submitted research proposals. Prospective nonproprietary users may propose independent or collaborative research. Access to User Facilities is also available on a full-cost-recovery basis for proprietary research that is not intended for publication. Adapted from Annual Report on the State of the DOE National Laboratories, U.S. Department of Energy, 2017, p. 157- 158, January 2017.40 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Edition The H2@Scale initiative, led by DOE's EERE, brings together stakeholders to advance affordable hydrogen production, transport, storage, and use while increasing revenue opportunities in multiple energy sectors. It includes DOE-funded projects at National Laboratories and in collaboration with industry to accelerate hydrogen research, development, and demonstration activities. Several CRADAs with international partners have been executed under H2@Scale, including agreements with Air Liquide (France), Chiyoda Corporation (Japan), Honda (Japan), and Tatsuno Corporation (Japan).5 In 2019, Carl Zeiss Industrial Metrology (part of Carl Zeiss AG of Germany) and ORNL executed a CRADA to gain a deeper understanding of additive manufacturing (AM) processes and materials using ZEISS' 3D ManuFACT solution. The partners are developing and implementing a comprehensive powder-to-part characterization methodology for the progression of AM at DOE's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at ORNL. Fast recipe development combined with improved mass production yield and methodology for quality certification of AM parts will also be defined and demonstrated.6 In January 2020, ORNL executed a $2.7 million CRADA with AddUp (France) to advance laser powder bed fusion technology and develop new materials processes for tooling. The goal is to use additive manufacturing technology to improve fabrication of complex mold and die tooling.7 In December 2018, the DOE established the Federal Oversight Advisory Body (FOAB) and the S&T Risk Matrix outlined under the International Science and Technology Engagement Policy memo. The S&T Risk Matrix highlights critical and emerging research areas and technologies that are expected to contribute to the economic and national security of the United States and mitigate the detrimental exploitation of these research areas and technologies by foreign Countries of Risk, currently defined as China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. The S&T Risk Matrix identifies research areas and technologies that do not overlap or supersede existing legal controls associated with national security or commercial restrictions.3.4 How to Work with the National Laboratories The National Laboratory complex stewards an abundance of DOE resources and provides opportunities to foster partnerships to tackle difficult problems beyond the capabilities of private industry or individual universities. This section outlines the various opportunities to partner with the National Laboratories. 3.4.1 Partnership Agreements To successfully transition technologies developed by the National Laboratories, DOE encourages and facilitates the use of a variety of partnering mechanisms with nonfederal entities. In recent years, DOE has explored new avenues to streamline partnership mechanisms and increase the impact of technology transfer efforts. For example, the ACT was piloted and ultimately established in 2017 to provide an additional agreement mechanism with unique flexibilities to address barriers, such as performance guarantees and required contract terms that have hindered non-federal access to National Laboratory capabilities. Through ACT, an Management and Operating (M&O) contractor can negotiate and accept financial and performance risks and accept terms and conditions (T&Cs) more consistent with industry risk-sharing practices that are otherwise not permitted under the T&Cs of CRADAs and SPPs. The FedACT Pilot authorizes Laboratories, for a period of three years to use the ACT mechanism, under certain circumstances, to engage partners that plan to use federal funding for work at DOE facilities. This reduces some of the difficulties that SBIR/STTR and other federal grant recipients experience with standard partnering mechanisms. Table 1 displays the number of active agreements in a given year between 2015 and 2019, with many agreements spanning more than one year. Most notably, in FY 2019, DOE and the National Laboratories managed and executed more than 1,000 CRADAs; 2,248 SPPs involving nonfederal entities (NFEs); and 126 ACTs. Partners contributed about $380 million to R&D efforts via these agreements in FY 2019 and nearly $1.7 billion between FY 2015 and FY 2019. Non-federal SPPs are the most significant component of industrial interactions in terms of number of agreements, with an 5https:/ /www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/09/f79/h2-at-scale-crada-projects-2020.pdf 6https:/ /www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zeiss-and-oak-ridge-national-laboratory-partner-for-advancement-of-powder-bed-additive- National Laboratories: 2020 Editionaverage of about 2,250 active agreements annually, and funds, with an average of nearly $245 million annually. In total, the National Laboratories used these mechanisms to partner with approximately 2,650 industry, academic, and non-profit partners between FY 2015 and FY 2019. Small businesses represented the largest segment of non-federal partnerships, with more than 1,200 different partners entering into agreements with the Laboratories. During the same timeframe, the Laboratories partnered with nearly 300 additional organizations, ranging from state and local governments to other FFRDCs. 3.4.1.1 DOE User Facilities Another measure of the extent to which the National Laboratories partner externally is the use of DOE User Facilities. An important reason for establishing the National Laboratory system was to provide a home for large-scale, costly scientific facilities that universities could not afford but were critical for sustaining America's effort in science. The DOE maintains and operates various User Facilities spanning across each of the energy, science, and national security Laboratories as shared resources for the scientific community, with access determined on a competitive basis using peer review. These facilities include high-performance computers, particle accelerators, large x-ray light sources, neutron scattering sources, specialized facilities for nanoscience and genomics. Additional detail and Laboratory specific missions of the facilities is provided in Appendix A and the strategic planning process for the DOE User Facilities is addressed in Section 4.TABLE 1: CRADAs, SPPs, AND ACTs AT DOE NATIONAL LABS (FY2015-FY2019) User Facility Spotlight: Pharmaceutical Industry: Pharmaceutical companies have extensively used macromolecular crystallography at the APS to aid in drug design. One example is Januvia\u00ae, a type 2 diabetes medication manufactured by Merck & Co. Januvia\u00ae helps lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, and is the top-selling brand in its class. The drug has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is one of the most popular type 2 diabetes drugs on the market. User Facility Spotlight: Space Exploration Collaborations: DOE's User Facilities contribute immensely to science, research, and technology development of mutual interest to DOE, NASA, and other space- program agencies. The National Synchrotron Light Source - II at BNL has performed non-destructive analysis of samples returned from NASA space missions. In addition, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility have been used for high-speed processing of data from ground and space-based science missions and for simulations leveraged in planning upcoming missions. DOE's 88- inch cyclotron at LBNL allows researchers to better understand the effects of radiation on materials and electronics. Finally, the Z-Pulsed Power Facility at SNL produces conditions of extreme temperature and pressure, enabling high energy density research in materials, astrophysics, and planetary science. 42 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionThe DOE User Facilities are not only vital tools for scientific discovery but also an important component of national economic competitiveness in a competitive international environment where discovery and innovation are moving faster than ever before. In FY 2019, nearly 35,000 researchers leveraged the User Facilities at the National Laboratories. Although a slight decline from the previous two years, the number of users in FY 2019 still represents a more than 40% increase in users from FY 2015, after which the number of users each year trended upwards. The average number of users annually during FY 2016 - FY 2019 was more than 34,000, as compared to about 26,000 during FY 2012 - FY 2015. Many of these are graduate students carrying out their research to obtain their PhDs. 3.4.2 Intellectual Property Intellectual property is an important component of the National Laboratory system. In FY 2019, DOE's National Laboratories and associated research facilities disclosed 1,891 new inventions and received 919 U.S. patents. The data indicates that, in FY 2019, inventions were disclosed at a higher rate than any time in the previous eight years. Going back farther, data indicates that FY 2019 invention disclosures were the highest since at least FY 2008. In addition, copyright assertions have remained fairly consistent in recent years with an average of about 475 annual assertions from FY 2016 to FY 2019. In parallel, the National Laboratories have continually added to the number of open source products (mostly software) available for licensing. 3.4.3 Return on Investment (ROI) DOE and OTT are focused on expanding the commercial impact of DOE research and accelerating taxpayer ROI. The ability to measure these returns is critical for continuous improvement. National efforts have been undertaken to address the ROI of Federal R&D investments, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) \"Green Paper\" that is part of its ROI initiative in support of the President's Management Agenda. DOE remains responsive to these initiatives at the Department level and has also undertaken internal initiatives to define and implement practices for measuring ROI and responding accordingly. The DOE technology transfer working group's metrics committee established a subcommittee focused on developing an approach to measuring ROI of technology transfer activities at the National Laboratories. The sub-committee is leveraging the OTT data call, DOE literature, benchmarking from the Association of University Technology Managers, and other external literature to develop an approach to measuring ROI. 3.4.4 Awards 3.4.4.1 R&D 100 Awards The quality and the impact of technologies that reach the commercial sector are important success metrics for DOE's technology development and commercialization efforts. Certain outcomes are tracked by DOE and the National Laboratories to determine impact, but indirect and independent assessments are also needed. FIGURE 2: TOTAL NUMBER OF USERS AT DOE USER FACILITIES (FY2012-FY2019) 43 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Edition The R&D 100 Awards are widely recognized in industry, government, and academia as a mark of excellence for the most innovative ideas of the year. The awards are the only industry-wide competition rewarding the practical applications of science. They are given annually to recognize exceptional new products or processes that were developed and introduced into the marketplace during the previous year. To be eligible for an award, the technology or process must be in marketable condition and available for purchase or licensing. The awards are selected by an independent panel of judges from industry, government, and academia, based on the technical significance, uniqueness, and usefulness. The DOE National Laboratories are highly successful and receive many R&D 100 Awards annually. 3.4.4.2 Federal Laboratory Consortium (FLC) Excellence in Technology Transfer Awards FLC was formally chartered by the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 to promote and strengthen technology transfer nationwide. Its members include about 250 Federal laboratories, including the 17 DOE National Laboratories and five DOE production facilities.8 Each year, FLC presents awards to organizations that serve as conduits for technology transfer and collaborate to develop and commercialize products and processes for commercial use. One of the most prestigious awards in technology transfer is FLC's Excellence in Technology Transfer (ETT) Award. Since the ETT Award program began in 1984, researchers at the National Laboratories have been recognized with awards in the category every year and the National Laboratories' overall share of awards is significant. For example, in 2020, the National Laboratories won 57% of the FLC ETT awards, which was one of DOE's highest years in terms of award percentage. FIGURE 3: INVENTION DISCLOSURES AND PATENTS: FY2012-FY2019 8As required by law, DOE contributes 0.008% of its R&D funding at FFRDCs to support FLC. This funding provides support for FLC- TT's operational costs such as website maintenance, publications, conference and meeting support/management.44 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Edition45 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionDOE conducts strategic planning and provides oversight management to maintain the scientific excellence and lasting impact of the entire enterprise, especially the National Laboratories. DOE has instituted several processes and efforts, described below, that encourage and enhance collaboration and strategic partnerships. These efforts ensure that the DOE and the National Laboratory complex are equipped to face current and future challenges, strive to further scientific discovery, and continue to benefit all Americans. 4.1 Establishment of New Offices for Effectiveness and Coordination DOE's leadership is responsible for the overall success and stewardship of the Department, especially the National Laboratories. DOE oversees a wide range of critical missions and capabilities, most of which are multi-disciplinary and crosscutting. Since 2017, the Secretary of Energy created new offices and realigned the organizational structure of the Department to foster better collaboration. These newly established offices facilitate complex-wide strategic planning and formulation of partnerships both within and outside of DOE. Figure 4-1 shows DOE's organization as of December 2020. 4.1.1 The Office of Strategic Planning and Policy OSPP was created in 2020 to coordinate policy formulation across DOE and serve as the principal advisory body for Secretarial policy decisions. The office is made up of senior advisors who are responsible for streamlining the formulation, development, and advancement of Departmental and Secretarial energy policy. The OSPP team has three primary functions in service to the Secretary. First, it shapes long-term strategic planning and policy consistent with the Secretary's vision across DOE and its complex. Second, it leads cross- program coordination groups to address long-standing challenges in critical mission areas. Third, it collaborates with the White House and other agencies to leverage DOE expertise in advancing national priorities. Taken together, these primary responsibilities allow the OSPP team to shape the long-term strategic direction of DOE while providing daily tactical support for the Secretary's decision- making and communications. 4.1.2 The Laboratory Operations Board In 2020, the LOB was reorganized to report under OSPP to ensure effective coordination between DOE strategic planning and policy decision making and the National Laboratories. The LOB Director reports to the OSPP Executive Director and acts as the OSPP Deputy Director to ensure alignment. The LOB is a committee composed of senior leaders from DOE Headquarters and the National Laboratory complex whose mission is to strengthen and enhance the partnership between DOE and the National Laboratories. The LOB works to improve management and performance to more effectively and efficiently 4.

The LOB also plays a vital role in strategic planning and operations of the National Laboratories by searching for creative ways to unleash the innovative power of the Laboratories and to attract and retain talent (people), modernize infrastructure (plant), and reduce the burden on how the Laboratories' work (processes). To contribute to an enterprise-wide effort to identify, manage, and resolve strategic issues pertaining to the effectiveness and efficiency of the Laboratories, the LOB Director maintains a close working relationship with the NLDC. This relationship improves visibility and aligns strategic direction between the Laboratory Directors and DOE's most senior leadership. 4.1.3 The Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office (AITO) The AITO was established in 2019 to elevate, accelerate, and expand DOE's transformative work in AI. Based in the Office of the Under Secretary for Science, AITO coordinates existing AI efforts, facilitates partnerships with external stakeholders in the private sector and with universities and other research institutions, and builds on the efforts to enhance the future of AI. As the DOE's center for AI, AITO works to accelerate the delivery of AI-enabled capabilities and the Department- wide development of AI, synchronize AI applications to advance DOE's core missions, and expand public and private sector strategic partnerships, all in support of American AI leadership. Since its establishment, AITO has created the AI Exchange (AIX) data base to help capture and align AI projects with DOE and Administration priorities. Currently, DOE and its National Laboratories are leading more than 600 AI projects designed to strengthen core missions in energy, cyber, and national security and to accelerate scientific discovery. In addition, AITO has launched two cross-cutting AI projects, focused on saving lives: First Five : This consortium is co-chaired by AITO and Microsoft with the mission of providing AI-enabled tools and real-time information to First Responders to help them save lives and protect assets and our nation's resources. The first line of effort in this Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief (HADR) space is an AI system that addresses key research areas such as damage assessment, search and rescues, natural disasters, and wildfire prediction and fire line containment. COVID Insights : This partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and DOE consists of an unprecedented framework of policy driven data- sharing that facilitates multimodal research, combining DOE's multi-disciplinary research scientists, advanced technologies, and AI capabilities with the power of Summit, ORNL's supercomputer. 4.1.4 The Arctic Energy Office (AEO) In 2020, the Secretary of Energy reestablished DOE's AEO, which is headquartered on the campus of the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. The AEO reports to the Under Secretary of Energy and coordinates DOE's Arctic activities across the enterprise, bringing together DOE's wide range of assets, stakeholders, and equities to serve communities and U.S. interests in the Arctic region. The AEO drives coordination and collaboration on DOE's programs in the Arctic region, including international cooperation on Arctic issues, research on methane hydrates, development of advanced microgrids, and the potential deployment of nuclear power systems such as small modular reactors. The reestablishment of this office strengthens DOE's work in energy, science, and national security in order to build an Arctic future of prosperity and increased opportunity. AEO brings the power of DOE innovation and expertise to the region and will ensure the Department plays an important role in its energy future. As the region's geopolitical importance increases, the AEO will also better facilitate strategic coordination with other Arctic nations. 4.1.5 The Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) CESER was established in 2018 and reports to the Under Secretary of Energy. This office fulfills a dual purpose: first, to work with industry to increase cybersecurity and physical security across multiple energy subsectors and interdependent sectors of critical infrastructure; and second, to coordinate emergency support function response for the energy sector. CESER was created from the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, which is now the Office of Electricity (OE), by divesting two legacy OE divisions (Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems and Infrastructure Security and Energy Restoration). 48 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionCESER's mission is to improve the security of the U.S. energy infrastructure against all hazards, through the three office divisions: Cybersecurity; Infrastructure Security & Energy Restoration; and Innovation, Research, & Development. CESER's efforts facilitate better communication and coordinated responses, to better position DOE to protect the Nation's energy infrastructure from emerging threats and natural disasters and support the Department's national security responsibilities. 4.2 Fostering Collaboration through Crosscutting Initiatives and Reports The Secretary uses advisory councils and coordinating committees to provide input and advise leadership on M&O within the Department. This effort strengthens the effectiveness of the DOE and provides an opportunity for counsel and management review. 4.2.1 The Research and Technology Investment Committee (RTIC) The RTIC was established in 2019 to convene key DOE elements and leaders to advise and make decisions that support R&D activities, coordinate their strategic research priorities, and identify potential cross-cutting opportunities in both basic and applied S&T. The RTIC has explored many cross-cutting topics, including: Energy Storage : RTIC established the Energy Storage Subcommittee, which was charged with establishing a comprehensive strategy on energy storage. The subcommittee chairs, EERE and the OE, analyzed and recommended strategies to position the United States as the global leader in energy storage. Through the subcommittee's efforts and approval by the RTIC, DOE then developed the Energy Storage Grand Challenge to accelerate development, commercialization, and use of next-generation energy storage technologies and achieve U.S. global leadership. As a complex-wide comprehensive strategy, the Energy Storage Grand Challenge engages with DOE offices and industry partners to better coordinate in five areas: technology development, technology transition, policy and valuation, manufacturing and supply chain, and workforce development. The subcommittee is currently developing the Energy Storage Grand Challenge roadmap, to ensure U.S. leadership in energy storage use and exports, with a secure domestic manufacturing supply chain that does not depend on foreign sources of critical materials. AI: In July 2019, the RTIC established the AI subcommittee to assess whether DOE and the AITO are strategically positioned to drive U.S. global leadership in AI. Led by the AITO and other relevant program offices, the subcommittee provided observations and recommendations to the RTIC, to further the missions of the DOE and AITO. These included the use of an automated system to track and collaborate on DOE AI activities, the development of a Departmental strategy for coordinating AI, and the prioritization of jointly funding AI partnerships within DOE and with industry. Critical Materials : In November 2019, the RTIC established the Critical Materials subcommittee to assess DOE's critical material needs and cross-cutting strategies. The subcommittee, chaired by EERE, FE, and NNSA, recommended the establishment of a council to assess and coordinate DOE's critical material requirements and the development of an action plan to address DOE's long-term critical materials challenges. OSPP is chairing a multi-program coordination committee to directly support the work of the council, which is overseeing the development of a DOE-wide critical minerals and materials strategy and action plan. STEM : Established by the RTIC in April 2020, a STEM working group was created after an initial DOE STEM workshop that assessed duplicative STEM efforts at DOE and the National Laboratories. A clear outcome from the workshop was recognition of the need to better coordinate STEM goals and efforts across the complex. The working group developed a DOE STEM framework and is conducting a landscape analysis of all DOE STEM activities. The working group then will develop an action plan to implement the recommendations. 4.2.2 The Secretary of Energy Advisory Board (SEAB) The SEAB provides the Secretary with timely, balanced, external advice on issues concerning the entire DOE and Laboratory complex. Composed of technical experts, business executives, academics, and former government officials, SEAB provides recommendations to the Secretary on DOE's basic and applied R&D development activities, economic and national security policy, educational issues, operational issues, and any other matters charged by the Secretary. Most recently, four SEAB working groups were established to provide recommendations on the maximization of AI and machine learning to support DOE's mission, promoting innovation in DOE policies and practices, optimizing DOE efforts to support space exploration, and elevating the profile of DOE's vital missions through improved 49 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Editionbranding. Since all of these topics are cross-cutting and overlap throughout the Department, the SEAB advises on how to best coordinate efforts and maximize efficiency. 4.2.3 OSPP As previously described, OSPP guides the coordination and implementation of DOE-wide cross-cutting strategy and policy. To minimize duplication of effort, OSPP frequently adopts and executes the recommendations of RTIC and SEAB working groups. Through its senior advisors, OSPP establishes, maintains, and chairs continuing DOE-wide coordination groups for the development and implementation of strategies. Three key examples of these efforts include the following: Establishment of a DOE and an interagency implementation plan for the Strategy to Restore American Nuclear Energy Leadership, the DOE- published interagency strategy based upon the President's Nuclear Fuel Working Group of 2019-2020; Drafting and coordination of a critical minerals and critical materials strategy, as recommended by the relevant RTIC working group; and Establishment of a DOE space strategy, the Energy for Space Exploration: U.S. Department of Energy Strategy to Support U.S. Space Preeminence that directly supports the recent National Space Strategy and is coordinated with other agencies to support long- term national space goals. 4.3 Executing the Strategic Planning Process The strategic planning process is crucial to successfully funding and operating the DOE complex, especially the National Laboratories. This process is important in funding decisions and the budget process between DOE programs and the Laboratories. Flow of funding from DOE program offices to each of the 17 National Laboratories can be found on individual National Laboratory At a Glance pages. Each Laboratory's involvement in strategic decisions and planning is key when determining technical and policy areas for each mission. The National Laboratories have an opportunity to present their strategic plans and feedback through the annual strategic planning process, described below. 4.3.1 DOE's Federal Advisory Committees In accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, Advisory Committees are utilized by the DOE to provide independent advice and guidance on a variety of complex scientific and technical issues. The DOE provides management support to more than 22 Federal Advisory Committees, involving over 900 members, whose recommendations are used to inform research program directions and investments. These Committees play a paramount role in strategic planning for entire fields of science by utilizing established processes for collecting independent input from the entire scientific community to formulate long-range plans for DOE programs. 50 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Edition4.3.2 Strategic Management of Science, Energy, and NNSA Laboratories The long-term vision and success of the DOE National Laboratories is a shared responsibility between DOE headquarters and the National Laboratory directors and senior leaders. To effectively manage and operate the Laboratory complex, the DOE program offices and National Laboratories must maintain a mutual understanding of the DOE and Administration evolving vision, long-term priorities, and operational goals. DOE and the Laboratories must work together, as a whole, to address the evolution of Laboratory capabilities, needs, and mission priorities. To support and facilitate strategic development, DOE formulates and issues annual planning guidance for the energy, science, and NNSA National Laboratories. The guidance may include particular topic areas that DOE asks the Laboratories to address in their plans, and typically requests the following information: A top-level summary of the Laboratory's mission; An outline of major funding sources and overall costs of operation; An overview of the Laboratory's current core capabilities; In-depth discussion about the Laboratory's S&T strategy for the future; The strategy and vision for technology transfer activities and strategic partnerships; An overview of site facilities and campus strategy for infrastructure; Relevant information on the current human capital situation and obstacles with respect to developing mission-ready workforce; and The strategy and approach used for cost management at the Laboratory. Each National Laboratory then produces a strategic plan that is presented to and reviewed by respective DOE leadership. The science and energy National Laboratories present their strategic plans in June and July of each year, and the NNSA National Laboratories, Plants, and Sites present their strategic plans every April. NNSA uses a tiered approach to strategic planning. NNSA-level strategic planning documents specify strategic goals and objectives and set NNSA-specific expectations for program execution. Most recently, these laboratory-level strategic plans included an emphasis on anticipated challenges, areas of effort, and the state of health for each Laboratory, Plant, and Site over the near-term (five year), mid-term (10 year), and long-term (25 year) planning horizon. While the planning processes may differ slightly, each Laboratory's strategic planning process is essential to addressing and coordinating key priorities and research goals. Each year, the planning process is evaluated and additional mechanisms are implemented to improve the process and coordination across the Department. The current DOE leadership has taken steps to strengthen the National Laboratory system by allowing all Laboratories and DOE program offices to participate in each of the science and energy Laboratory reviews. In addition, NNSA has also allowed leadership from headquarters, field offices, program offices and the NNSA Laboratories, Plants, and Sites to participate in the strategic planning briefs. This important step increases the transparency across the complex and encourages the Laboratories to receive DOE and Laboratory-wide feedback. The strategic planning process provides an opportunity for the program offices to become more engaged with Laboratories across the entire enterprise. During the annual Laboratory planning presentations, DOE participants are able to provide critical verbal feedback to each Laboratory and have an opportunity to ask questions. After the briefings, written feedback is also provided to each Laboratory for review and consideration. Once there is agreement on a path forward for the Laboratory, DOE is able to use the input to inform the budget process and planning.The National Synchrotron Light Source II at Brookhaven National Lab. Nations with the fastest supercomputers and most advanced light sources will have a distinct advantage in the race for discovery and innovation. 51 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionThroughout the annual Laboratory planning process, DOE engages and coordinates with appropriate program stakeholders across the complex. The primary importance of this annual exercise is to develop a shared understanding of the future direction of the National Laboratories and how each Laboratory will contribute to DOE's current and future mission needs by both senior Laboratory and DOE leadership. 4.3.3 Strategic Planning Process for User Facilities As described in Section 3, DOE operates national scientific User Facilities that provide thousands of researchers with the most advanced tools of modern science and are an important component of national economic competitiveness. Today the international competition is fierce to develop and deploy the most advanced scientific facilities. Nations with the fastest supercomputers and most advanced light sources, for example, will have a distinct advantage in the race for discovery and innovation across a broad range of fields, from physics, materials science, chemistry, and genomics to medicine. While each DOE User Facility exists through investment by a program sponsor, the DOE provides funds through congressional appropriations for construction and operations. The decision to invest in a User Facility is a complex one that requires input from the scientific community. DOE works extensively with outside partners in industry, academia, and other organizations when planning to construct the next generation of User Facilities. The decision ultimately emerges through long-term strategic planning that engages the scientific community (see 4.3.1) to help identify research tools that will deliver the greatest scientific impact to advance the DOE mission. Each User Facility represents a substantial commitment on the part of its sponsoring program, which provides oversight and works closely with the facility management to maximize scientific impact and productivity. 4.4 Envisioning and Building Toward the Future of DOE DOE recognizes the value of advancing the mission and working to build future opportunities. A successful strategic plan and management of the complex includes efforts that look toward a bright future for the Department. As pioneers of scientific innovation that reshapes our lives, America's National Laboratories have always been focused on the future. In addition, a major focus is addressing today's nuclear security challenges, as well as those that our nation will confront in the future. To that end, DOE is committed to recruiting, training and retaining the next generation of world-class scientists, engineers, and technicians, as well as taking proactive steps to ensure that the NNSA infrastructure is modern, robust, resilient, and able to meet our nation's nuclear security mission today, and into the future. Acting as a central part of an ecosystem of discovery that also includes universities and industrial companies, the National Laboratories create breakthroughs that require strategic long-term planning that aligns missions, capabilities, and societal need. 4.4.1 NLDC \"Future S&T Opportunities\" To deliver on the promise of public investment in R&D that promotes U.S. prosperity and security, in 2020 the NLDC analyzed and identified key opportunities that could make our society healthier, wealthier, and more secure. Through a forward-looking (20- to 30- year horizon) strategic planning effort, the NLDC laid out five key paths forward for further inquiry and innovation, which include the future of five broad fields of endeavor: Biotechnology and the future bioeconomy Accelerator science, technology, and engineering Deterrence Computing Energy systems As a whole, these mission areas represent the broad purview of research at America's National Laboratories as well as describe their global impact. The three broad S&T platforms\u2014biotechnology, computing, and accelerators\u2014help drive discoveries in the crosscutting themes of deterrence and energy systems. Through a history of prioritizing the formation of tightly focused, well-coordinated and fully supported teams that can communicate across disciplines, the National Laboratories, in support of DOE's mission, engage with leaders in both the public and private sector, which allows for further development of their ideas and implementation of a robust R&D agenda over the coming decades focused on significant global and national challenges.52 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 Edition4.4.2 Looking to the Future: DOE's SC \"Laboratories of the Future\" The Laboratories of the Future initiative was created to consider future possibilities without being concerned about limitations or constraints presented by the current Laboratory structure or legal environment. This initiative is asking a set of questions of former and current DOE and Laboratory leaders, early and mid- career researchers at the Laboratories, and external stakeholders including university researchers and leaders, scientific professional societies, industrial partners, and international partners. Participants provide DOE answers to these questions on an individual basis, and do not work together to reach a consensus. The core question being asked is, \"What would the DOE National Laboratories be like if we had the power to make them any way we wanted?\" Embedded in that question are inquires such as \"What makes the DOE National Laboratories so special? What has allowed them year after year to produce the groundbreaking research for which they are so well respected?\" Although this project is in its initial stages and ongoing, several themes have already started to emerge. The Laboratories of the Future initiative not only gives the current DOE and Laboratory employees an opportunity to provide anonymous feedback, but it also strives to enhance the workplace for future generations of employees all across the complex.4.4.3 Developing the Future Workforce Developing the Nation's current and future workforce is key to the Department's success. DOE is actively working to retain and grow the current workforce through several projects and initiatives. In addition, training the next generation of STEM employees is important when preparing for the future. DOE and the National Laboratories have a variety of on-going workforce and STEM education development efforts to engage K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students in order to develop a pipeline of future employees. A few specific efforts are described below. 4.4.3.1 LOB's Efforts to Identify Policy Implementations to Enhance the Workforce The LOB has formed several working groups to identify opportunities to enhance DOE's workforce development efforts, recommend possible policy changes, and work toward implementation. Specifically, the LOB explored ways to enhance the innovation culture and collaboration through physical and virtual structures. An example includes enhancing and leveraging virtual platforms that enable the connection of the community and the DOE complex, such as the OTT LPS. The LOB also explored ways to retain, grow, and inspire the top talent at the DOE. The recommendations were based on ways to invest in the people and enhance the workforce development efforts. The recommendations focused on sharing best attraction and retainment practices, developing leadership, especially early- career individuals, and recognizing and rewarding top talent.53 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionApplied Materials Science and Engineering Chemical and Molecular Science Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science300 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees 47 joint faculty 38 postdoctoral researchers 88 undergraduate students 98 graduate students 104 visiting scientistsAT A GLANCE: AMES LABORATORY FUNDING BY SOURCE MISSION UNIQUE FACILITIESCORE CAPABILITIESHUMAN CAPITAL PHYSICAL ASSETSFACTSAmes Laboratory delivers critical-materials solutions to the United States.

Machine learning is enhancing research and operations across the laboratory, allowing SLAC to operate accelerators more efficiently, speed the discovery of new materials, and uncover distortions in space-time 10 million times faster than before. At SLAC's X-ray facilities, scientists can use machine learning to analyze data in real time so they can adjust their experiments on the fly for maximum efficiency. 85 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionAT A GLANCE: THOMAS JEFFERSON NATIONAL ACCELERATOR FACILITY FUNDING BY SOURCE MISSION UNIQUE FACILITIESCORE CAPABILITIESHUMAN CAPITAL PHYSICAL ASSETSFACTSThomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) is the preeminent laboratory in precision studies of the fundamental nature of confined states of quarks and gluons, including the protons and neutrons that make up the mass of the visible universe. Central to that is the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF), the first large-scale application of superconducting radiofrequency technology. Tools, techniques, and technologies developed in pursuit of the laboratory's scientific mission enable an ever-increasing array of applications\u2014from detectors for medical and biological use, to advanced particle accelerators for environmental remediation.

As the first large-scale application of SRF technology in the world, CEBAF is the world's most advanced particle accelerator for investigating the quark structure of the atom's nucleus. The CEBAF's energy has been upgraded from 6 GeV to 12 GeV to expand the scientific reach of Jefferson Lab in support of the highest-energy experiments. The laboratory is a world leader in CEBAF-enabled SRF accelerator technology\u2014and continues to advance accelerator technology as well as expand its applications beyond scientific research. ACCOMPLISHMENTS Tech-to-Market Highlight: Scintillating Medical Imaging In 2018, a new cancer treatment monitoring system, built by Radiadyne with detector technologies developed for Jefferson Lab's nuclear physics (NP) program, won an R&D 100 Award and the Medical Device Engineering Breakthrough Award. The OARtrac\u00a9 monitoring system allows clinicians to monitor and adjust radiation delivered to patients through a novel application of scintillating fiber material used in NP to identify experiment-produced particles. The FDA cleared the system to use patient-specific Plastic Scintillating Detector sensors utilized during cancer treatments. Jefferson Lab's Cynthia Keppel, staff scientist and Halls A and C leader, collaborated with Radiadyne early in developing this technology\u2014nearly a decade in moving from laboratory to market. This is the latest in a number of medical imaging applications based on Jefferson Lab particle detection technologies developed into successful products that are impacting cancer detection and treatment. Research Highlight: The Size of the Proton All ordinary matter, from the sun that powers our solar system to the Earth we inhabit, is built on protons inside the atom's nucleus. In the early 2010s, new experiments measuring the size of the well-studied proton, in terms of its charge radius, yielded a smaller size than expected. Nuclear physicists carefully re-measured this basic quantity using a new experimental technique and the high-quality electron beam at TJNAF, finding an even smaller proton size of approximately .83 femtometers.AT A GLANCE: THOMAS JEFFERSON NATIONAL ACCELERATOR FACILITY 87 The State of the DOE National Laboratories: 2020 EditionAPPENDIX B: DOE ACCOMPLISHMENTS Since the beginning of this Administration, DOE has made significant progress across its entire mission space, having...
