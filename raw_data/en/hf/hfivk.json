With improved research and more precise data from India and Nigeria - both among the 10 most-pop- ulous countries in the world - we see that there are many more opioid users and people with drug use disorders than previously estimated. Globally, some 35 million people, up from an earlier estimate of 30.5 million, suffer from drug use disorders and require treatment services. The death toll is also higher: 585,000 people died as a result of drug use in 2017. Prevention and treatment continue to fall far short of needs in many parts of the world. This is particu - larly true in prisons, where those incarcerated are especially vulnerable to drug use and face higher risks of HIV and hepatitis C transmission. This gap represents a major impediment to achieving the Sus - tainable Development Goals and fulfilling the international community's pledge to leave no one behind. Synthetic opioids continue to pose a serious threat to health, with overdose deaths rising in North America and trafficking in fentanyl and its analogues expanding in Europe and elsewhere. The opioid crisis that has featured in far fewer headlines but that requires equally urgent international attention is the non-medical use of the painkiller tramadol, particularly in Africa. The amount of tramadol seized globally reached a record 125 tons in 2017; the limited data available indicate that the tramadol being used for non-medical purposes in Africa is being illicitly manufactured in South Asia and traf - ficked to the region, as well as to parts of the Middle East. The response to the misuse of tramadol illustrates the difficulties faced by countries in balancing nec- essary access for medical purposes while curbing abuse - with limited resources and health-care sys- tems that are already struggling to cope - and at the same time clamping down on organized crime and trafficking. Opium production and cocaine manufacture remain at record levels. The amounts intercepted are also higher than ever, with the amount of cocaine seized up 74 per cent over the past decade, compared with a 50 per cent rise in manufacture during the same period. This suggests that law enforcement efforts have become more effective and that strengthened international cooperation may be helping to increase interception rates. The World Drug Report 2019 also registers a decline in opiate trafficking from Afghanistan along the \"northern\" route through Central Asia to the Rus- sian Federation. In 2008, some 10 per cent of the morphine and heroin intercepted globally was seized in countries along the northern route; by 2017 it had fallen to 1 per cent. This may be due in part to a shift in demand to synthetics in destination mar- kets. The increased effectiveness of regional responses may also play a role. Countries in central Asia, with the support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), have committed considerable resources to strengthening regional cooperation through integrated UNODC country, regional and global programmes, as well as through platforms such as the Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Centre, the Afghanistan-Kyrgyzstan- Tajikistan Initiative and the T riangular Initiative and its Joint Planning Cell. More research is needed, including to identify lessons learned and best practices that could inform further action. International cooperation has also succeeded in checking the growth in new psychoactive substances. The Vienna-based Commission on Narcotic Drugs has acted swiftly in recent years to schedule the most harmful new psychoactive substances, and the UNODC early warning advisory has helped to keep the international community abreast of developments. Political will and adequate funding remain prereq- uisites for success. Efforts by Colombia to reduce cocaine production following the 2016 peace deal PREFACE2 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2019DEPRESSANTSwith the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) are a case in point. Alternative development initiatives have enabled farmers in central areas of the country previously under FARC control to aban - don coca bush cultivation and join the licit economy. The result has been a drastic reduction in cocaine production. However, in other areas previously con - trolled by FARC, criminal groups have moved in to fill the vacuum and expand cultivation. Alternative development can succeed, but not without sustained attention and integration into broader development goals. The successes identified amid the many, formidable problems that countries continue to face in grap - pling with drug supply and demand highlight that international cooperation works. The challenge before us is to make this cooperation work for more people. International cooperation is based on agreed frame - works. Nearly every country in the world has reaffirmed its commitment to balanced, rights-based action based on the international drug control con - ventions. The most recent reaffirmation of that commitment is the Ministerial Declaration on Strengthening Our Actions at the National, Regional and International Levels to Accelerate the Imple- mentation of Our Joint Commitments to Address and Counter the World Drug Problem, adopted at the ministerial segment of the sixty-second session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. UNODC supports countries in putting their com- mitments into action through the application of international standards on the prevention and treat - ment of drug use disorders and HIV, as well as standards and norms on the administration of justice and the treatment of prisoners. We provide tailored technical assistance through our field offices and global programmes, and through toolkits and research. I hope the World Drug Report 2019 will shed further light on the world drug problem and inform inter- national community responses. By working together and focusing attention and resources, we can help people get the services they need without discrimi- nation, promote security and bring criminals to justice, safeguard health and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

Since there is some scientific and legal ambiguity about the distinctions between \"drug use\", \"drug misuse\" and \"drug abuse\", the neutral term \"drug use\" is used in the World Drug Report. The term \"misuse\" is used only to denote the non-medical use of prescription drugs. All uses of the word \"drug\" and the term \"drug use\" in the World Drug Report refer to substances con - trolled under the international drug control conventions, and their non-medical use.All analysis contained in the World Drug Report is based on the official data submitted by Member States to the UNODC through the annual report questionnaire unless indicated otherwise.

The main classes of depressants discussed in this section include opioids, sedatives, tranquillizers and hypnotics. The sections on drug supply discuss both the depressants that have been diverted from licit sources and those that have been manufactured illicitly, while the sections on drug demand discuss the medical and non-medical use of depressants. To aid understanding of how depressants function in the human body, preliminary information is provided in the relevant sections. While depressants of the central nervous system are used on their own for the psychoactive effect, they 1 Marc Vogel and others, \"T reatment or 'high': benzodiaz- epine use in patients on injectable heroin or oral opioids\", Addictive Behaviors, vol. 38, No. 10 (October 2013), pp. 2477-2484. 2 Takahiro Yamamoto and others, \"Concurrent use of benzo- diazepine by heroin users: what are the prevalence and the risks associated with this pattern of use?\", Journal of Medical Toxicology, vol. 15, No.1 (January 2019), pp. 4-11.also figure prominently in the polydrug use patterns of people who use different drugs. One pattern of such use is the concurrent use of two or more depres - sants, such as the use of alcohol and benzodiazepines with opioids, to self-medicate or potentiate the effects of the opioid.1, 2 In other instances, people who use depressants such as opioids as their primary drug, in response to market dynamics such as changes in the availability, purity and price of a drug, may readily switch to another opioid (for example, from oxycodone to heroin or vice versa) in order to maintain the same level of psychoactive experience.3 Depressants are also used concurrently or sequen - tially with stimulants, either to overcome the side-effects of the other substance or to alleviate the adverse effects and severity of withdrawal symp - toms.4, 5 3 See also World Drug Report 2016 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.16.XI.7). 4 Francesco Leri and others, \"Understanding polydrug use: review heroin and cocaine co-use\" Addiction (2003), 98, pp. 7-22. 5 Keith A September 2011, vol. 99, No. 3, pp. 451-458.SCOPE OF THE BOOKLET Global pharmaceutical opioids opium13% sedatives and tranquillizers10 tons103 tons-73% sedatives and from previous year 693 tons9 Opioids3OPIOIDS Introduction \"Opioids\" is a generic term that refers both to opi- ates and their synthetic analogues.6 Opiates are naturally occurring alkaloids found in the opium poppy, such as morphine, codeine and thebaine, as well as their semi-synthetic derivatives, such as heroin, hydrocodone, oxycodone and buprenor - phine. 7, 8 The term \"opioids\" also includes synthetic opioids, which are structurally diverse substances. Some are used in medicine mainly for the manage- ment of pain resulting from conditions such as trauma, surgery and cancer, and are thus also referred to as pharmaceutical opioids, indicating their medi - cal use.9 Most pharmaceutical opioids are controlled under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 with the exception of some, such as buprenor - phine, which are controlled under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. T ramadol is 6 WHO, Lexicon of Alcohol and Drug T erms (Geneva, 2014). 7 Ibid. 8 All opiates are controlled under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, except for buprenorphine, which is controlled under Schedule III of the Convention on Psycho- tropic Substances of 1971. 9 See, for example, World Drug Report 2017 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.16.XI.6).an example of a pharmaceutical opioid that is cur- rently not controlled under the drug conventions. Nowadays, most opium is illegally produced for either its non-medical consumption or for the illegal manufacture of morphine and its semi-synthetic derivative, heroin, which are substances controlled at the international level under the 1961 Conven- tion. Opium and opium poppy straw are also produced legally for medical use, mostly for the manufacture of morphine, codeine and thebaine, as well as the subsequent manufacture of a number of semi-synthetic opioids, which also belong to the category of \"opiates\". A number of synthetic opioid receptor agonists have been developed by the pharmaceutical industry over the past half century, both for medicinal use, includ - ing in veterinary medicine, with the aim of developing more effective medicines for pain management. A few of those substances proved to be effective and were later released into the pharmaceutical market, opiatessynthetic opiods tramadol research opioidsfentanyl and controlled under 1961 Convention, with the exception of pentazocine, which is controlled under the 1971 Convention.10 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2019DEPRESSANTScentre\" in the brain, intestines and the peripheral neurons, produces other effects such as suppression of breathing, constipation and sensations of warmth in association with the use of opioids.10 In addition to these effects, opioid peptides impact a wide vari - ety of other functions such as the regulation of stress responses, feelings, mood, learning, memory and immune functions.11 Pharmaceutical opioids for medical purposes Pharmaceutical opioids have been used for the man - agement and control of acute and chronic pain that can result from physical trauma and post-surgical care, and for palliative therapy for cancer and other chronic conditions. In addition, pharmaceutical opioids such as buprenorphine and methadone are on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for 10 UNODC, \"Understanding the global opioid crisis\", Global SMART Update, vol. 21 (March 2018). 11 WHO, Neuroscience of Psychoactive Substance Use and Dependence (Geneva, 2004).but many were not developed further and were never marketed as pharmaceutical opioids. Some discarded substances, including many fentanyl analogues and research opioids, such as U-47700 and AH-7921, are derived from information provided in the research publications of pharmaceutical companies and have now been introduced into the illicit drug markets. A few of those substances, such as furanylfentanyl and U-47700, have recently been placed under inter - national control; substances not under international control are classified as NPS with opioid effects. Opioid receptors In the human body there are three types of opioid receptors - mu (\u00b5), delta () and kappa () recep- tors - that mediate the activity of both exogenous opioids (drugs) and endogenous peptides such as the endorphins. Extensively present in the brain, brainstem and the spinal cord, opioid receptors are responsible for triggering brain reward systems and producing analgesia (pain relief) by decreasing pain transmission.

In some coun - tries, heroin is used in a medical context as part of heroin-assisted treatment directed at people for whom other opioid treatment options have previ - ously failed. Such treatments can help those people to remain in treatment, limit their use of street drugs, reduce their illegal activities, and possibly reduce their likelihood of overdose and mortality. In such heroin-assisted programmes, heroin is administered, preferably in a clinical setting as unadulterated, subsidized or even cost-free.12 In addition, some of the opioids that are available over the counter are also used to relieve cough and severe diarrhoea. According to INCB, the consumption for medical purposes of pharmaceutical opioids that are under international control more than doubled from 1998 to 2010 (as expressed in defined daily doses), fol - lowed a stable trend from 2010 to 2014, then decreased by 10 per cent until 2017.13 12 Marica Ferri, Marina Davoli and maintenance for chronic heroin-dependent individuals\", Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, No. 12 (2011). 13 INCB, Narcotics Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019 - Statistics for 2017 (E/INCB/2018/2) and previous years.Mesolimibic dopamine system The mesolimbic dopamine system, involving the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens in the brain, is involved in the stimuli-reward-motivation processes.a Dopa - mine is the main neurotransmitter involved in this system and is responsible for mediating feelings of reward, pleasure motivation, drive and aggression, among others, and related stress conditions. While cocaine and other amphetamine-like psychostimulants are known to block dopa - mine transporters, increasing dopamine con- centration in the synaptic space, opioids have been reported to increase dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, which is one of the principal mechanisms of the rewarding effects.b The associative learning properties related to the release of dopamine strengthen the rein- forcing effects of the drug as well as of the environment and emotional reactions associ- ated with its use (stimuli and reward) and establish the compulsive conditioned behav - iour known as \"addiction\". a WHO, Neuroscience of Psychoactive Substance Use and Dependence (Geneva, 2004). b Ide Soichrion and others, \"Distinct roles of opioid and dopamine systems in lateral hypothalamic intracranial self-stimulation\", International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, vol. 20, pp. use Source: INCB, Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2018 for 2016 (E/INCB/2017/1), para. 36.Indication or conditionMain Moderate to Mild to moderate painCodeine, dihydrocodeine and dextropropoxyphene Induce or supplement anaesthesiaFentanyl and use disordersBuprenorphine and methadone12low over the period 2015-2017 (expressed in stand - ard daily doses), suggesting a severe ongoing lack of accessibility to, and availability of, pain medication for the majority of the inhabitants of middle- and low-income countries.14 14 INCB, Narcotics Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019 - Statistics for 2017 (E/INCB/2018/2) and previous years.The marked increase in the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical opioids in the first decade of the new millennium increased the global per-capita con - sumption of those substances. The increase has been uneven, however, with extremely high levels of per- capita consumption in North America, particularly in the United States of America, while per-capita consumption of pharmaceutical opioids in the rest of the Americas, Africa and Asia remained relatively Fig. 1 Availability of pharmaceutical opioids for medical use (in defined daily doses per million inhabitants), average over 2015-2017 Source: INCB, Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019 - Statistics for 2017 (E/INCB/2018/2). Note: Consumption is measured in terms of reported wholesale sales to medical doctors, pharmacies and hospitals. For the purposes of the 1961 Convention, a drug is regarded as \"consumed\" when it has been supplied to any person or enterprise for retail distribution, medical use or scientific research.Increase in the medical use of fentanyl Until the 1980s, fentanyl was mainly used for the induction of anaesthesia and, in combination with other sub- stances, for anaesthesia in short-term surgical interventions. Since the early 1990s, the applications of the drug have proliferated. Controlled-release preparations (patches) of fentanyl have been introduced, as have new delivery methods, including a sublingual spray that helps cancer patients cope with severe pain. Increasingly used in all parts of the world for the treatment of severe pain, fentanyl in all its applications has created a rapidly growing licit demand for the expansion of the manufacture of the substance, which only came to a halt in recent years after reports of increasing numbers of overdose deaths attributed to the non-medical use of fentanyl and its analogues (notably in North America). This is despite the fact that, in many cases, the fentanyl and fentanyl analogues that actually caused the overdose deaths appear to have been illicitly manufactured and trafficked.a a INCB, Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2018 - Statistics for 2016 (E/INCB/2017/2).DEPRESSANTSWORLD DRUG REPORT 2019 174 317 8,81212,563 408 73530,814 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,000 Central America and the CaribbeanSouth AmericaNorth America Africa Asia Europe Oceania AmericasConsumption in S -DDD per inhabitant13 Non-medical use of opioids 3users. The major opioids of concern in North Amer - ica remain pharmaceutical opioids, hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine and tramadol, which are used for non-medical purposes. The annual prevalence of opiates (mainly heroin) use in 2017 is also esti- mated to be higher (0.7 per cent) in North America than the global average of 0.6 per cent. The use of opioids in Australia and New Zealand also remains much higher than the global average (3.3 per cent of the adult population), with the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids also being the main opi- oids of concern. As the prevalence of opioid use in Asia is also high, with nearly 1 per cent of the population estimated to be past-year users, the size of the population of the region means that more than half of global opioid users reside in Asia (29 million past-year opioid users). Within Asia, the Near and Middle East and South-West Asia have a high prevalence of opioid use (2.3 per cent of the adult population) with a total of almost 8.5 million past-year opioid users in those two subregions combined. The high prevalence of opioid use in those subregions is driven by use in Afghanistan, Iran (Islamic Republic of) and Pakistan; however, there are differences in the nature of the opioid problem in those countries. In Afghanistan, opium remains the predominant opioid, with nearly 70 per cent of opioid users reporting using opium, but there is also substantial use of heroin and non- medical use of pharmaceutical opioids.17 In the Islamic Republic of Iran, nearly 90 per cent of opioid users report using opium or the condensed extract of smoked opium ashes (shireh).18, 19 In Pakistan, opioid use is more mixed: in 2012, notwithstanding polydrug use among opioid users, of the estimated 2.7 million opioid users, 1.6 million also reported the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids, whereas over 1 million people were estimated to be regular opiate users, of whom the majority were heroin users (860,000) while one third were opium 17 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), \"Drug use in Afghanistan: 2009 survey\" (2009). 18 Official statistics reported by the Drug Control Headquarters, Islamic Republic of Iran. 19 Masoumed Amin-Esmaeili and others, \"Epidemiology of illicit drug use disorders in Iran: prevalence, correlates, comorbidity and service utilization results from the Iranian Mental Health Survey\", Addiction, vol 111, No. 10, (October 2016).In parallel to the strong increase in the production and sale of opioids for medical use, in North Amer - ica there has been an increase in the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids and its adverse con- sequences, with an alarming increase in the number of fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose cases reported. Other subregions, such as North Africa, West and Central Africa and the Near and Middle East, have also reported the spread of the non-medical use of tramadol, an opioid not under international control. At the global level, concerns about the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids has created a challenge due to the concomitance of two opposing needs. On the one hand, the supply of and accessibility to pain medication are insufficient to treat pain in many regions (particularly in middle- and low- income countries) where people suffer disproportionately from a lack of medication for pain management; on the other hand, rigorous mar - keting and the over-prescription of opioids, particularly in North America, have had the conse- quences of iatrogenic addiction and fatal and non-fatal overdose cases in people requiring pain management. Some of these concerns have prompted measures, in North America, for example, aimed at gradually strengthening the overall control system for prescribing and dispensing pharmaceutical opi- oids and developing guidelines for the management of chronic pain.15, 16 Non-medical use of opioids Overview of the use of opioids in different regions In 2017, an estimated 53 million people (range 47-60 million) globally, or 1.1 per cent of the popu - lation aged 15-64, used opioids at least once in the past year, of whom half were past-year users of opi- ates (heroin and opium). The highest prevalence of non-medical use of opioids is estimated in North America, at nearly 4 per cent of the population aged 15-64, representing one quarter of global opioids 15 See, for instance, Deborah Dowell, Tamara M.

These estimates are driven by India, where 2.1 per cent of the population aged 10-75, a total of 23 million people, are estimated to be past-year opioid users (2018).22 Among opioids, heroin is the most preva - lent substance, with a past-year prevalence of use of 1.1 per cent among the population aged 10-75, 22 Atul Ambekar and others, Magnitude of Substance Use in India 2019 (New Delhi, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, 2019).Opioids OpiatesFig. 2 Use of opioids and opiates, by Source: UNODC, responses questionnaire.15 Non-medical use of opioids 3followed by non-medical use of pharmaceutical opi - oids, the prevalence of which is almost 1 per cent of the general population, and opium, the prevalence of which is almost 0.5 per cent. The past-year use of opioids is much higher among men in general (4 per cent of the male population) than women (0.2 per cent of the female population). Moreover, 1.8 per cent of adolescents aged 10-17 are estimated to be past-year opioid users. Of the total 23 million past-year opioid users, roughly one third, or 7.7 million people, are considered to be suffering from opioid use disorders in India. The states with the highest prevalence of opioid use in the country are those in the and Delhi, in the north of the country. West and Central Africa is also a subregion with a high prevalence of non-medical use of opioids (1.9 per cent or an estimated 5 million opioid users), which is dominated by the non-medical use of phar - maceutical opioids, in particular of tramadol. However, the lack of data on the prevalence of drug use in Africa makes it difficult to quantify its trends and level. In Nigeria, for example, the prevalence of pharmaceutical opioids in 2017 was estimated at 4.7 per cent of the population aged 15-64 (corre- sponding to an estimated 4.6 million past-year users), most of which can be attributed to the non-medical use of tramadol and, to a lesser extent, the non-medical use of codeine and morphine.23 The estimated prevalence of opioid use in Europe in 2017 was estimated at 0.7 per cent of the adult population, or nearly 3.8 million opioid users. In Western and Central Europe, where there are an estimated 2 million opioid users (0.6 per cent of the adult population), the use of opioids is dominated by heroin use. However, in recent years there have been indications of an increase in the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids in the subregion, with methadone, buprenorphine and fentanyl reported as the main pharmaceutical opioids misused.24 The non-medical use of opioids in South and Central America in 2017 was estimated at 0.2 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively. Most of the countries in those subregions report the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids more than of heroin. Among countries in South America, in Chile, one country where recent information on non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids has been reported, the past- year prevalence of non-medical use of pharmaceutical 23 UNODC, Drug Use in Nigeria 2018 (Vienna, 2018). 24 EMCDDA, European Drug Report 2018: Trends and Devel- opments (Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union, 2018).00.20.40.60.811.21.4 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016Annual prevalence (percentage)Fig. 3 Non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids, Chile, 2002-2016 Source: Chile, Ministry of the Interior and Public Security, Twelfth national study of drug use among the public of Chile, 2016 (D\u00e9cimo Segundo Estudio Nacional de Drogas en Poblaci\u00f3n Non-medical use of opioids by sex and age group, Chile, 2010 and 2016 Source: Chile, Ministry of the Interior and Public Security, Twelfth national study of drug use among the public of Chile, 2016 (D\u00e9cimo Segundo Estu- dio Nacional de Drogas en Poblaci\u00f3n General de Chile).16 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2019DEPRESSANTSmaintain their patterns of consumption and switched to heroin use as they considered it more reliably available through drug dealers, more potent and more cost effective than pharmaceutical opi- oids.30, 31 Another major change in the market for pharma - ceutical opioids in the United States occurred in 2010, when changes were made in the formulation of OxyContin\u00ae (oxycodone) one of the main opioids misused in the country. The new abuse-deterrent formulation of OxyContin\u00ae made it controlled release32 and tamper proof so that it could no longer be crushed and snorted or injected.33 However, the increase in heroin use in the United States had already begun and therefore preceded the changes introduced in policies and practices related to pre- scription opioids. Nevertheless, given the large number of non-medical users of pharmaceutical opioids, even a small proportion switching to heroin use has translated into a much larger number of people using heroin.34 Between 2002 and 2011, pooled data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health showed that, among new initiates to heroin use, the likeli- hood of initiation of heroin use among people who had reported non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids was 19 times higher than among those who had not reported non-medical use of pharmaceuti- cal opioids. The rate of heroin initiation increased, as the frequency of past-year non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids and among people with opioid use disorders increased. Conversely, only a small percentage (3.6 per cent) of those who had initiated the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids had initiated heroin use within the five-year period following their first non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids.35, 36 30 Compton and others, \"Relationship between nonmedical prescription-opioid use and heroin use\". 31 Daniel Ciccarone, \"The triple wave epidemic: Supply and demand drivers of the US opioid overdose crisis\", International Journal of Drug Policy (February 2019). 32 Controlled release formulation is designed to achieve optimal therapeutic levels over a defined period. 33 Cicero and others, \"Effect of abuse-deterrent formulation of OxyContin\". 34 Compton and others, \"Relationship between non-medical prescription opioid use and heroin use\". 35 Pradip K. Muhuri, Joseph C. Gfroerer and Christine opioids increased from 0.3 per cent in 2012 to 1.2 per cent in 2016. In 2016, the non-medical use of opioids was particularly high among women, although it has increased markedly among men as well as among the age groups 26-34 and 35-44.25 Drivers of the opioid epidemic in the United States In the United States of America, the increase in the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids since 1997 has been attributed in part to a number of reasons, including the organization of the health system's structures for regulation and control of access to those drugs, prescription practices, the med - ical dispensing culture and patient expectations.26 The number of opioid prescriptions dispensed from retail pharmacies in the United States increased from 174 million in 2000 to 256.9 million in 2009.27 This increase in combination with high dosages and the longer duration of opioid prescriptions, primar - ily for the management of acute to chronic non-cancer pain, resulted in further diversion and misuse of pharmaceutical opioids and the develop- ment of opioid use disorders among users.28, 29 Attributed mainly to the availability of pure and cheaper heroin in the market, a gradual increase in heroin use has also been observed in parts of the United States since 2006. It has been hypothesised that the transition from the non-medical use of pre - scription opioids to the use of heroin, especially among young people, could be part of the progres- sion of addiction in a subgroup of non-medical users of prescription opioids who considered it costly to 25 Chile, Ministry of the Interior and Public Security, D\u00e9cimo Segundo Estudio Nacional de Drogas en Poblaci\u00f3n General de Chile. 26 Benikt Fischer and others, \"Non-medical use of prescrip- tion opioids and prescription opioid-related harms: why so markedly higher in North America compared to the rest of the world?\", Addiction, vol. 109, No. 2 (February 2014), pp.177-181, 27 Nicholas B.

Out of an estimated 11.1 million people in the United States in 2017 who had used opioids non-medically in the past year, 10.5 million of them (95 per cent) had primarily used pharma- ceutical opioids and 5 per cent, about half a million, had also used heroin. This accounts for more than half of the estimated 886,000 people who had pri- marily used heroin in the past year.37 Up until 2013 sporadic outbreaks of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues containing heroin were causing deaths among heroin users in the United States.38 Davies, \"Associations of nonmedical pain reliever use and initiation of heroin use in the United States\", CBHSQ Data Review (Rockville, Maryland, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, August 2013). 36 See also, Theodore J.

In subsequent years, the availability of heroin, synthetic opioids and other drugs containing fentanyls, their profitability, and increasing restrictions on prescription opioids, with a large population misusing pharmaceutical opioids, could have contributed further to the opioid epi - demic in the United States. Fentanyls have been used as an adulterant of heroin and cocaine and also sold as falsified prescription opioids, such as oxyco - done or hydrocodone and even as falsified benzodiazepines, to a large population of opioid users who were unaware of the actual contents.39, 40 This has resulted in incidents with fatal conse - quences for opioid users, as seen in the dramatic increase in the number of fatal and non-fatal over- dose cases in the United States.41 It appears also that many people who have used fentanyl have often experienced or encountered a non-fatal overdose and therefore they consider that use of fentanyl should be avoided.42, 43 However, demand for fen- tanyl itself has emerged within small groups of users and may be reported in certain areas where high- frequency users with tolerance to heroin and other opioids may seek out fentanyl. The rapid expansion of fentanyl is also visible in seizures. Since 2014, the number of seized samples that the National Forensic Laboratory Information System of DEA in the United States has analysed and identified as fentanyl has been increasing con- siderably. In 2017, fentanyl represented a third of the pharmaceutical opioids that were identified in 39 Ibid. 40 United States, Department of Justice, DEA, 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment (October 2018). 41 Alana M.

In 2017, fentanyl made up the highest percentage of seized pharma- ceutical opioid samples in the North-east and the Midwest (55 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively),44 which are regions with a comparatively higher preva - lence of heroin use in the United States. Trends in opioid use in the United States According to survey data, in the United States, since the increase over the period 2013-2014, the preva - lence of heroin use has remained relatively stable, at 0.3 per cent of the population aged 12 and older, or around 900,000 past-year users, while the annual prevalence of non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids decreased from a peak in 2015 of 4.7 per cent of the population aged 12 and older (12.5 mil - lion past-year users) to around 4.2 per cent of the population aged 12 and older (11 million past-year users) in 2017.45 Considering that the national household survey excludes institutionalized and homeless populations, which may have dispropor- tionately higher rates of non-medical use of opioids, these estimates are probably an underestimation of the extent of such use in the United States. For example, the number of chronic heroin users46 esti- mated in 2010 at 1.5 million47 was more than twice the number of past-year users (620,000) or six times the number of past-month heroin users (240,000) estimated in the national household survey in the same year. 44 United States, Department of Justice, DEA, Diversion Control Division, \"National Forensic Laboratory Informa- tion System: NFLIS-Drug 2017 annual report\" (Springfield, Virginia, 2018). 45 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra- tion, Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indicators in the United States: Results from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. 46 Defined as those who had used heroin for four days or more in the past month. 47 Jonathan P Caulkins and others, \"Cocaine's fall and mari- juana's rise: questions and insights based on new estimates of consumption and expenditures in US drug markets\", Addic- tion, vol. 110, No. 5 (May 2015), pp 728-36.Fig. 6 Number of substances submitted to and analysed by forensic laboratories, by type of drug identified, United States, 2009-2017 Source: United States, Department of Justice, DEA, National Forensic Laboratory Information System, reports for different years.020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000140,000160,000180,000200,000 010,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,000 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Number of heroin samplesNumber of pharmaceutical opioids samples Oxycodone Hydrocodone Tramadol Fentanyl Heroin Fig. 7 Use of heroin and non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids in the United States, number of people, 2002-2017 Source: United States, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indicators in the United States: Results from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2018).00.40.81.21.62 02468101214 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 Number of people who used heroin in the past year (millions)Number of people who used prescription opioids for non- medical purposes in the past year (millions) Pharmaceutical opioids Heroin19 Non-medical use of opioids 3Map 2 Non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids in the past year among the population aged 12 and older in the United States, by state, 2017 Source: SAMISHA, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, NSDUH, 2016 and 2017.

Opioid use in Canada Information on the non-medical use of opioids in Canada is very limited. In 2017, around 85,000 people or nearly 0.4 per cent of the population aged 15-64 reported the past-year use of pharmaceutical opioids in order to \"get high\", with the highest rates being among young adults aged 20-24 (1.1 per cent) and young people aged 15-19 (0.8 per cent,).49, 50 There is insufficient information on the extent of non-medical use of opioids among women and most age groups for the country.51 Trends and patterns of opioid use in Europe The annual prevalence of opioid use in Europe in 2017 is estimated at 0.7 per cent of the population aged 15-64, with heroin remaining the most commonly used opioid in the region. In Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, the prevalence of opiate use (heroin and opium) remains higher (0.7 per cent) than in other subregions, although there was a decrease in the preceding years in the overall use 49 Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey, February- December 2017. 50 Owing to \"high sampling variability\", these results are to be interpreted with caution. 51 Owing to \"high sampling variability\", the prevalence among women and other age groups cannot be estimated. pharmaceutical opioids was more prevalent in completely rural counties (4.3 per cent) and small metropolitan counties (4.3 per cent) than in large metropolitan (3.9 per cent) and urbanized counties (3.9 per cent).48 48 United States, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, Results from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Detailed T ables (Rockville, Maryland, 2018).012345678 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.8 12 and older 12-17 18-25 26 and older 12 and older 12-17 18-25 26 and older Annual prevalence of pharmaceutical opioids (percentage)Annual prevalence of heroin (percentage)Heroin Pharmaceutical opioids 13579 Male Female White Hispanic or Latino Native American African American Asian Less than high school High-school graduate College graduate Full-time Part-time Unemployed Sex Ethnicity Education EmploymentAnnual prevalence (percentage) Fig. 9 Use of opioids in the United States, by age group, 2017 Source: United States, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Ser - vices Administration, Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indica- tors in the United States: Results from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2018).21 Non-medical use of opioids 3Notwithstanding an increase in the prevalence of opioid use in Poland in 2016, opioid use in the rest of Western and Central Europe has remained quite stable over the past five years. In Western and Cen- tral Europe there seems to be an ageing cohort of opioid users who have been in contact with drug treatment services, and who present a range of chronic medical conditions associated with ageing as well as problems associated with long-term opioid use.52, 53 Apart from heroin, some of the most common opi - oids reported in countries in the European Union in recent years are opium, morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol and various fentanyl ana - logues.54 Some of those opioids may be diverted from legitimate pharmaceutical supplies, while others are illicitly manufactured and sold. The non- medical use of pharmaceutical opioids in Western and Central Europe is mainly observed in the con- text of users seeking alternatives to heroin. The prevalence of the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids remains quite low in the subregion and is essentially linked to the diversion of methadone or buprenorphine for non-medical use among opioid users, including self-medication outside treatment settings.55 In recent years, an increasing number of countries in Western and Central Europe have reported that more than 10 per cent of opioid users who enter treatment do so for problems related to opioids other than heroin.56 The non-medical use of buprenorphine is reported by around one third of opioid users in treatment in Czechia, while the non- medical use of methadone is reported by almost a quarter of opioid users in treatment in Denmark. 52 Anne Marie Carew and Catherine Comiskey, \"Rising incidence of ageing opioid users within the EU-wide treatment demand indicator: the Irish opioid epidemic from 1996 to 2014\", Drug and Alcohol Dependence, vol. 192 (November 2018), pp. 329-337. 53 Anne Marie Carew and Catherine Comiskey, \"T reatment for opioid use and outcomes in older adults: a systematic literature review\", Drug and Alcohol Dependence, vol. 182 (January 2018), pp. 48-57. 54 EMCCDA, European Drug Report 2018. 55 Paul Evans-Brown and Roumen Sedefov, \"The misuse of psychoactive medicines: getting the balance right in complex system\", Addiction, vol. 109, No. 2 (February 2014), pp. 182-188. 56 EMCCDA, European Drug Report 2018. of opioids in the subregion, driven primarily by the decrease in the number of registered opioid users in the Russian Federation. In the Russian Federation, which used to have a high prevalence of opioid use, the opioid market has started to change in recent years, and synthetic drugs other than opioids have started to dominate. The number of first-time entrants into treatment for opioid use (mostly heroin use) decreased by more than three quarters over the period 2006-2017. In Western and Central Europe (mainly the States members of the European Union), heroin remains the main opioid used. Opioid use in the subregion remained stable over the past decade, but there have been signs of an increase or resurgence in the opioid market since 2013, with a major increase observed at the subregional level in the prevalence of opioid use in 2016. The increase was primarily the result of higher opiate use estimates reported by Poland, reflecting not only an increase in the prevalence of heroin use, from 0.1 per cent of the population aged 15-64 in 2014 to 1.1 per cent in 2016, but also high levels of use of \"kompot\" (1.7 per cent), a home-made heroin preparation manufactured from poppy straw in that country. France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United King - dom, which account for some 60 per cent of the population of the European Union, are estimated to account for three quarters of the estimated high- risk opioid users in the European Union.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Annual prevalence (percentage)Fig. 10 Opiate use in Western and Central Europe, 2003-2017 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.22 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2019DEPRESSANTSopioids seized and had replaced heroin use in the country.58 Although national estimates of opioid use are not available for Estonia, the majority of people who inject drugs there reportedly inject 3-methylfentanyl and, since 2015, other fentanyl analogues such as furanylfentanyl, acrylfentanyl, carfentanil, and ocfentanil.59 In Finland, the proportion of clients entering treatment for non-medical use of buprenorphine 58 Ilkka Ojanper\u00e4 and others, \"An epidemic of fatal 3-methylyfentanyl poisoning in Estonia\", International Jour- nal of Legal Medicine, vol. 122, No. 5 (September 2008), pp. 395-400. 59 EMCDDA, \"Estonia: Estonia drug report 2018\" (June 2018).In Cyprus and Poland, between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of opioid users are in treatment for problems related to the use of opioids such as oxycodone (Cyprus), and \"kompot\" in Poland.57 Over the past two decades, Estonia and Finland have experienced a transition from the use of heroin to the use of fentanyl (in the case of Estonia) and buprenorphine (in the case of Finland).

More than 60 per cent of those inter - viewed matched the criteria of dependence and had a prior history of substance use disorders, more than half were aged 18 or under and two thirds had taken at least two courses of tramadol, each for more than one week's duration, without a prescription during the previous year.65 Various studies suggest that the high level of non- medical use of tramadol in the above subregions is the result of the drug's easy availability in pharma- cies and on the illicit (\"black\") market, its low price in comparison with controlled drugs and the per - ception among users, especially young people, that since tramadol is a medication, its use does not carry the same level of risk and stigma as the use of other controlled drugs.66, 67, 68, 69 National-level prevalence estimates of the non-med - ical use of tramadol for most countries in the Middle East and West and Central and North Africa are not available, but different studies and surveys in a few countries point to a widespread non-medical use of tramadol in those subregions.70 For example, in 2016 in Egypt, 3 per cent of the adult population reported non-medical use of tramadol in the past year, while nearly 68 per cent of people in treatment for drug use disorders were being treated for drug-use patterns\", International Addiction Review, vol. 2, No. 1 (April 2018), pp. 6-13. 65 Ebrahim Zabihi and others, \"Potential for tramadol abuse by patients visiting pharmacies in Northern Iran\", Substance Abuse: Research and Treatment, vol. 5 (2011), pp. 11-15. 66 Samir Abou El Magd and others, \"T ramadol misuse and dependence in Egypt and the UAE: user characteristics and drug-use patterns\", International Addiction Review, vol. 2, No. 1 (April 2018), pp. 6-13. 67 Saeed Bashirian, Majid Barati and Yadollah Fathi, \"Prevalence and factors associated with tramadol abuse among college students in West of Iran: an application of the theory of planned behaviour\", Avicenna Journal of Neu- ropsychiatry, vol. 1, No. 1 (August 2014), pp. 26-30. 68 Nabil R.

In 2014, a smaller proportion of clients in treatment also reported the use of the opium derivatives, tram - adol, oxycodone, codeine preparations and fentanyl.62 Tramadol: the opioid crisis In recent years, tramadol, a synthetic opioid not under international control, has emerged as an opioid of public health concern in many subregions, in particular West, Central and North Africa. The non-medical use of tramadol is also reported in the Middle East and in other parts of Asia as well as in Europe and North America. In middle-income and developing countries, the non-medical use of phar - maceutical opioids such as tramadol seems to occur in contexts where health-care systems, including for the dispensing of prescription opioids, are not well developed or regulated, and where falsified or illic- itly manufactured/trafficked pharmaceutical opioids are available to meet the demand for the non-med- ical use of the substances.63 In Egypt, for example, since 2000 there has been an increase in the non-medical use of tramadol among people entering treatment for drug use dis- orders. However, there has been a change in their source of supply, as most patients report having obtained tramadol from pharmacies in the early 2000s by bypassing the regulations for dispensing prescription painkillers, whereas over the next 10 to 15 years most reported resorting to the illicit market to obtain tramadol, which had been illicitly manufactured and smuggled into Egypt.64 In a 60 Hanna Uosukainen and others, \"T welve-year trend in treatment seeking for buprenorphine abuse in Finland\", Drug and Alcohol Dependence, vol. 127, Nos. 1-3 (January 2013), pp. 207-214. 61 EMCDDA, \"Finland: Finland drug report 2018\" (June 2018). 62 Finland, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Finland Drug Situation 2014, report 3/2015 (Tampere, Finland, 2015). 63 Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2012 (E/INCB/2012/1). 64 Samir Abou El Magd and others, \"T ramadol misuse and dependence in Egypt and the UAE: user characteristics and 24 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2019DEPRESSANTScollege students (aged 18-30) in the west of the Islamic Republic of Iran showed that 11 per cent of respondents had used tramadol non-medically in the past year and that the majority of those users (75 per cent) had also used it in the past month.74 A significant proportion of students also reported high levels of social pressure for the non-medical use of tramadol. The first ever survey among secondary school students in Egypt also showed a high prevalence of the non-medical use of tramadol as well as of the use of opium and morphine among 15-19-year-old students in 2016.75 Another study of people with tramadol use disorders in treatment in Egypt and the United Arab Emir- ates in 2018 showed that the non-medical use of tramadol was more common among young people aged 26-35, those with a primary or secondary school education (as opposed to little or no school - ing, or with university education), and those who were currently unemployed or were skilled workers.76 A number of studies in the Middle East and North Africa have shown that tramadol is used non-med- ically for a number of reasons, including: for its pleasurable effect, i.e., to improve mood; for the prolongation of the duration of sexual intercourse; to delay the sensation of fatigue; because of the per - ception that its effects last long; and as self-medication for pain relief or the relief of symptoms of depression, anxiety or other comorbid psychiatric disorders.77, 78 The non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids attributed to tramadol among Egyptian university students\", Journal of Addiction Medicine, vol. 12, No. 2 (March 2018), pp. 150-155. 74 Bashirian, Barati and Fathi, \"Prevalence and factors associated with tramadol abuse among college students in West of Iran\". 75 Egypt, General Secretariat of Mental Health and Addiction T reatment, and Pompidou Group, Council of Europe, Med - SPAD: Results of the First Mediterranean School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (MedSPAD) in Egypt (December 2017). 76 Samir Abou ElMagd and others, \"T ramadol misuse and dependence in Egypt and the UAE: user characteristics and drug-use patterns\", International Addiction Review, vol. 2, No. 1 (April 2018), pp 6-13. 77 Ibid. 78 Nabil R.

T ramadol was also the first substance that the majority had initiated at around 20 years of age.72 The non-medical use of tramadol is also reported as being quite common among young people and university students. A study among university stu- dents in Egypt (2012-2013) revealed that the past-year prevalence of the non-medical use of tramadol was 12.3 per cent, with the average age of onset being 17. The non-medical use of tramadol among university students was correlated with the use of cannabis and alcohol as most (85 per cent) tramadol users reported concurrent use of more than one substance.73 Another study, in 2014, among 71 Egypt, General Secretariat of Mental Health of the Ministry of Health, \"Report of the General Secretariat of Mental Health and Addiction T reatment on tramadol\" (2017). 72 Palestinian National Institute of Public Health and UNODC, Estimating the Extent of Illicit Drug Use in Palestine (November 2017). 73 Medhat M.

This makes tramadol attractive to broad sections of society, including students during examinations and bus and taxi drivers in a number of developing countries, who would not otherwise be using any opioids.82 Non-medical use of tramadol is also reported in other parts of the world. In 2018, for example, of 130,000 respondents to the Global Drug Survey, although a non-representative sample (young people, mainly aged between 18 and 35, who have access to the Internet, and mostly in developed countries), 2.3 per cent reported past-year non-medical use of the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence - fentanyl analogues, synthetic cannabinoids, cathinones, and medicines: pregabalin and tramadol\" (Geneva, 2019). 82 See, for example, World Drug Report 2018.in the Middle East and North Africa seems to be less a result of \"iatrogenic addiction\", when non- medical use of those substances occurs after receiving treatment for a legitimate medical condition, and seems to be more led by the desire, especially among young people and people with substance use disorders, to use them for non-medical purposes.79, 80 Given its dual properties of being an opioid while also acting on the serotonergic and noradrenergic receptor system,81 tramadol, in contrast to other 79 Sahba Jalali and others, \"Higher Regulatory Control of T ramadol to Prevent its Abuse and Dependence\", Journal of Drug Policy Analysis (January 2017). 80 Medhat M Bassiony and others, \"Opioid use disorders attributed to tramadol among Egyptian university students\", Journal of Addiction Medicine, vol. 12, No. 2 (March/April 2018), pp. 150-155(6). 81 WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, \"Annex 1: extract from the report of the forty-first meeting of Non-medical use of opioids in Nigeria The first ever comprehensive survey of drug use in Nigeria, in 2018, revealed that the past-year prevalence of the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids (mainly tramadol) was 6 per cent among men and 3.3 per cent among women. Corresponding to 4.6 million past-year users of pharmaceutical opioids aged 1564 in Nigeria, the non- medical use of opioids was second only to the use of cannabis, which had an estimated prevalence of 10.8 per cent among the population aged 1564. The mean age of initiation of the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids (mainly tramadol) was 21 and, on average, past-year opioid users had regularly used opioids for 12 years. Nearly 80 per cent of all opioid users were daily or near-daily users and spent around $3.60 per day on pharmaceutical opioids, compared with $10 on heroin. The past-year prevalence of the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids (tramadol, codeine, morphine) was high among almost all age groups but was particularly high among people aged 3539 and 6064. Polydrug use was also a common feature among opioid users, with more than half reporting using concurrently or sequentially 45 sub- stances, including cannabis, pharmaceutical opioids (tramadol, cough syrup and tranquilizers. The majority of opioid users suffered from a severity of dependence that would require intervention to address their drug use disorders, with nearly 40 per cent of opioid users reporting that they wanted help or treatment for their drug problems but were unable to get it. High scores of severity of dependence, in general, have been associated with a high risk of injecting and sexual behaviours that were observed among opioid users in the survey. Nearly half of drug users reported problems at home, school or workplace as the main problems they face as a consequence of their regular drug use. Other drug users reported being in physical danger or having relationship issues with family or friends or trouble with law enforcement officials because of their drug use. Many high-risk drug users also reported committing petty crimes such as theft, shoplifting and burglary to finance their drug use. Moreover, almost one out of eight people in the general population had suffered a negative experience in the past 12 months as a result of a person using drugs in their family, neighbourhood or community.

Winstock and others, Global Drug Survey (GDS) 2018: Key Findings Report 2018 (London, 2018).The non-medical use of tramadol in West Africa: early findings from an ongoing study The non-medical use of tramadol in West Africa has raised concerns in recent years. There is a severe lack of quan- titative information on drug use in West Africa, but several countries in the region have reported tramadol as one of the drugs most consumed (in a non-medical context), after cannabis. The only country with recent scientific data, Nigeria, indicates that pharmaceutical opioids (tramadol, codeine, and morphine) were the second most misused drugs after cannabis in 2017.a, b In West Africa, the non-medical use of tramadol is reported by authorities across all ages, genders and socioeconomic classes, both in urban and rural areas. One particularly worrying finding is that there are reports of tramadol being misused by children in schools. Most tramadol tablets or capsules appear to be bought on the informal market (street markets, itinerant sales people, tea sellers, etc.) with packaging mentioning a dosage higher than that available in pharmacies. While the regulation of supply chains of pharmaceutical opioids in most West African countries may be vulnerable to risks of diversion for the non-medical use of pharmaceutical drugs, it seems that the majority of the tramadol used non-medically is derived from illegally imported shipments, rather than from the diversion of legally imported products. Interviews with non-medical users of tramadol show that they are looking for a number of different effects. Some consume tramadol for its calming, analgesic and anti-fatigue effects in order to improve intellectual, physical and working performances, and to lessen the need for sleep and decrease appetite. In farming communities, there are reports of tramadol being used by humans and fed to cattle to enable them to work under extreme conditions.b Others use tramadol as a recreational drug on account of its stimulant and euphoric effects, or to improve sexual stamina. Drug users also use tramadol as a substitute for heroin, to ease withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Attrac- tive packaging encourages the recreational use of tramadol and the fact that it is a medicine makes its use without a prescription perceived as non-harmful. As stated by WHO, however, the non-medical use of tramadol \"has the potential to precipitate drug abuse and/or dependence in humans\".c Polydrug use is common among people who use tramadol non-medically in West Africa. T ramadol is reported to be used along with coffee, alcohol, cannabis and with substances such as taurine and caffeine; some users mix tra- madol and codeine. The use of diazepam and other benzodiazepines seems to be common among people who use tramadol non-medically, together with, or instead of, tramadol.

In 2017, the largest numbers of opioid overdose deaths were reported in British Columbia (1,482: 30.8 deaths per 100,000 population) Ontario (1,265: 8.9 deaths per 100,000 population) and Alberta (745 deaths: 17.4 deaths per 100,000 population), and, overall, among males and among people aged 30-39.86 In Europe, Estonia has recorded a high rate of opioid overdose deaths (10.6 per 100,000 population) attributed to the use of fentanyls. After a peak in the number of opioid overdose deaths in 2012 (170 deaths), the rate decreased steadily until 2015 then increased in 2016 (114 deaths: 13.4 deaths per 100,000 population). Results of toxicological exami - nations attributed the majority of those deaths to synthetic opioids, mainly 3-methylfentanyl and other fentanyl analogues such - nylfentanyl and acrylfentanyl.87 86 Canada, \"Overview of national data on opioid-related harms and deaths\", 12 December 2018. 87 EMCDDA, \"Estonia drug report 2018\".2017, nearly 68 per cent (47,600) of all overdose deaths (70,237) were attributed to the use of opi - oids, corresponding to a rate of 14.6 deaths per 100,000 population. Of those, the largest number of overdose deaths were attributed to synthetic opi - oids such as fentanyl and its analogues, which increased from over 19,000 overdose deaths in 2016 to over 28,000 in 2017. Overdose deaths attributed to other pharmaceutical opioids and heroin remained stable, at high levels, from 2016 to 2017. Drug overdose rates, including opioid overdose deaths, which were higher than the national rate of 14.6 per 100,000, were mainly reported in states in the eastern United States. From 2013 to 2017, the overdose death rate increased significantly in 35 states (out of 50), including the District of Colum - bia. Fifteen of the 20 states, for which quality overdose data were available, reported a significant increase in the overdose death rate involving syn - thetic opioids in the previous year; they included eight states west of the Mississippi river (Arizona, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, Texas and Washington). Over the period 2016- 2017, opioid overdose deaths increased significantly among both sexes, among opioid users aged 25-44, across most ethnic groups and in metropolitan areas with a population between 250,000 and 1 million inhabitants (referred to as \"medium metro coun - ties\") and suburban areas with a population of 1 million or more (referred to as \"large fringe metro\" areas). Overall, the overdose epidemic in the United States continues to worsen, with the increasing involvement of both pharmaceutical and illicitly sourced drugs: in 2016, synthetic opioids (primarily illicitly sourced fentanyls) were involved in 24 per cent of deaths involving pharmaceutical opioids, 37 per cent of those involving heroin, and 40 per cent of those involving cocaine.85 In Canada, 3,998 opioid-related deaths were reported in 2017, corresponding to a rate of 10.9 deaths per 100,000 population.

A total of 590 overdose deaths were reported in Sweden in 2016 (9.5 per 100,000 population), of which opioids accounted for over 90 per cent. Fentanyl analogues were intro - duced into the drug market in Sweden in 2014, through online sales of illicit fentanyl analogues, mainly in the form of nasal spray but also in the form of tablets, powder and capsules.88 Since 2015, fentanyl analogues have resulted in an increasing number of overdose deaths. While the number of heroin overdose deaths remained high in Sweden over the period 2015-2017, fentanyl and fentanyl analogues accounted for a larger number of overdose deaths; however, the majority of those deaths involved more than one substance.89 Overall, most fentanyl analogue deaths in 2015 were attributed to acetylfentanyl (31 cases), while in 2016 most were attributed to acrylfentanyl (43 cases) and in 2017 to cyclopropylfentanyl (72 cases). In 2017, people who died from a fentanyl overdose were older on average (median age: 44.6) than those whose overdose was caused by fentanyl analogues (median age: 32.9).90 In Northern Ireland, the number of opioid-related deaths has been increasing since 2013.

In addition, in recent years other opioid receptor agonists, such as AH-7921, MT-45, and U-4700, or similarly named substances, have been reported, seized and analysed.95, 96 Many synthetic opioid receptor agonists, including AH-7921, MT-45 and U-4700 have been sold as such to regular opioid users.97 Other synthetic opi - oids, including fentanyl analogues, are reportedly sold in drug markets as replacements for controlled drugs, and in many instances as falsified prescrip - tion painkillers such as oxycodone, and even as falsified benzodiazepines.98 In other instances, syn - thetic opioids have been used as adulterants to heroin and other drugs, such as cocaine, and those buying them, sometimes marginalized opioid users, are not usually aware of their exact contents and often miscalculate their doses, with deleterious consequences.99 Many fentanyl analogues are marketed for non- medical use directly to users and almost exclusively on the Internet.100 The proliferation of e-commerce has also facilitated the sale of synthetic opioids through both the conventional Internet and the darknet.101, 102 As reported in recent cases in Sweden, unlabelled nasal sprays containing acryloylfentanyl (acrylfentanyl) have been offered for purchase online;103 there are also reports of \"e-liquids\" containing fentanyl analogues that can be vaped 95 EMCDDA, EMCDDA-Europol Joint on a New Psychoactive Substance - 1-cyclohexyl-4-(1,2-diphenylethyl)pip- erazine ('MT-45'), Joint Report Series, MT-45 (Luxembourg, Publication Office of the European Union, 2014). 96 \"Swedish National Threat Assessment on fentanyl analogues and other synthetic opioids\". 97 Ibid. 98 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment. 99 Ibid. 100 EMCDDA, Fentanils and Synthetic Cannabinoids: Driving Greater Complexity into the Drug Situation - An Update from the EU Early Warning System (Luxembourg, Publication Office of the European Union, 2018). 101 Armenian and others, \"Fentanyl, fentanyl analogues and novel synthetic opioids\". 102 EMCDDA, Fentanils Cannabinoids. 103 \"Swedish National Threat Assessment on fentanyl analogues and other synthetic opioids\".increasing. It is noteworthy that almost half of recorded drug overdose deaths involved three or more drugs, of which diazepam was the most com- monly reported substance. The most deaths resulting from drug misuse were reported to be those of young males aged 25-34.91 Emergence of new psychoactive substance opioids With the aim of developing more effective medica - tions for pain management, both for medicinal and veterinary use, a number of synthetic opioid recep- tor agonists have been developed by the pharmaceutical industry in the past five decades. After initial research, however, many of the sub - stances were not further developed, or were considered \"not suitable for human consumption\". In recent years, along with fentanyl analogues, many opioid receptor agonists, which are derived from information published in the research publications of pharmaceutical companies or patents, have emerged in the illicit drug markets. In the scientific literature they are often referred to as \"research opi - oids\" or \"novel synthetic opioids\".92 From the perspective of UNODC, since these substances are not under international control they have been labelled as \"NPS with opioid effects\" or \"NPS of varying potency and, as with other opioids, their clinical effects are dose dependent. Although they are structurally unrelated to morphine, NPS opioids are full agonists of the -opioid receptors, which account for profound depression of the central nerv - ous system and respiratory system; this is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality associated with their use.93 In cases of toxicity with NPS opioids, larger doses of naloxone are required to reverse the effects than in cases of overdose with many other opioids.94 NPS opioids appear to be an expanding group of substances that are being introduced into the drug market for non-medical use.

Global area under opium poppy cultivation and opium production declined in 2018 Despite a decrease in size of 17 per cent from the previous year, the global area under illicit opium poppy cultivation remained at a high level of around 346,000 ha in 2018. Global opium production also decreased in 2018, by 25 per cent, but the estimate is still among the highest in the past two decades. Of the estimated 7,790 tons of opium produced worldwide in 2018, it is estimated that some 1,225- 1,525 tons remained unprocessed for consumption as opium, while the rest was manufactured into heroin, resulting in an estimated 486-736 tons of heroin (expressed at export purity) being manufactured in 2018. Both opium and heroin prices continued to decline in 2018 in Afghanistan and Myanmar, implying that there is no sign of a possible shortage of opiates on the market as a result of the decline in global opium production in 2018. using electronic cigarettes.104 Overall, synthetic opioids are becoming a major concern that requires regular monitoring by law enforcement, toxicological laboratories, chemists, pharmacists and physicians, in order to improve understanding of their emergence and provide guidance for responding to the threat to individual and public health that they pose. Supply of opiates Opium is illicitly produced in some 50 countries worldwide, although production is highly concen- trated in Afghanistan, Myanmar and Mexico, which accounted for roughly 96 per cent of global opium production over the period 2014-2018. Opiates produced in Afghanistan, the single largest opium producer, have a global reach. They supply markets in neighbouring countries, Europe, the Near and Middle East, South Asia, Africa and a small proportion of the markets in North America (mainly Canada) and Oceania.

However, cultivation and production declined in all regions in 2018, in particular in the northern, western and central parts of the country and, to a lesser extent, in eastern, southern and north-eastern Afghanistan.105 This was mainly the result of a severe drought that affected not only rain-fed but also irrigated land. As it had not snowed sufficiently in the mountains in the winter of 2017/2018, there was not sufficient groundwater for irrigating many parts of the country, including areas under opium poppy cultivation. The subsequent lack of rain negatively affected rain-fed opium poppy cultivation in western and northern Afghanistan.106 The drought not only affected opium production but also agriculture in general. This caused a humanitarian crisis in several parts of the country, in particular in western and northern 105 UNODC and Afghanistan, Ministry of Counter Narcotics, Afghanistan Opium Survey 2018: Cultivation and Production (November 2018). 106 Ibid.

Income for cov- ering basic needs, including food, medical expenses and debt were the three most common uses of opium income reported by farmers in Afghanistan in 2017.110 In particular, \"infrequent poppy farm- ers\" cited the need to repay loans as a key reason for cultivating opium poppy.111 Decline in opium production also reported in Myanmar Opium poppy cultivation in Myanmar, home to the world's second largest area under opium poppy cultivation, continued to decline in 2018, with the country accounting for 11 per cent of the global area under illicit opium poppy cultivation worldwide that year. Some 37,300 hectares of opium poppy are estimated to have been cultivated in the country in 2018, which represents a decline of 12 per cent from the previous year and of one third since 2015.112 Opium production in Myanmar also No. 33275 (Washington D.C., World Bank, July 2005). 110 UNODC and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Afghanistan Opium Survey 2017 - Challenges to sustainable development, peace and security, (May 2018). 111 Ibid. 112 Percentage decline estimated based on the regions where estimates were available in both 2017 and 2018 (Shan and part of the country, where 1.4 million people were considered at risk of acute food insecurity as a result of the drought in the spring of 2018, and that situation led to a forecast decrease in cereal production of some 28 per cent in 2018 from the average for the period 2013-2017.107 Apart from the drought, sharply falling opium prices - probably a consequence of the record opium pro - duction in 2017 - might have acted as a disincentive for farmers to grow opium poppy in 2018. Opium prices continued to decline in 2018,108 while the indebtedness of many Afghan farmers increased as a consequence of the drought. Research has shown that growing indebtedness, often in the form of \"salaam\" arrangements, in which the following year's opium harvest is sold in advance in exchange for immediate cash payments, may prompt farmers, irrespective of a decrease in opium prices, to revert to opium poppy production in order to repay their debts.109 Cultivating opium poppy is one of the 107 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture, \"Country brief: Afghanistan\", 21 June 2018. 108 Afghanistan, Ministry of Counter Narcotics and UNODC, \"Afghanistan drug price monitoring monthly report\" (March 2019). 109 Mohammad Ehsan Zia and others, Rural Finance in Afghanistan and the Challenge of the Opium Economy, Report - 40 80 120 160 200 240 - 100 200 300 400 500 600 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2016 2017 2018 2019 Mid-term trends in farmgate prices (dollars per kilogram)Long -term trends in farmgate prices (dollars per kilogram) Long -term trends Mid -term trends Dry farmgate prices - long -term trends (January 2003 -March 2019) Dry farmgate prices - mid-term trends (January 2016 -March 2019)33 Supply of opiates 3the previous year, to 30,600 hectares.115 In general, opium poppy cultivation in Mexico is found in areas that are not easily accessible and are characterized by a low level of economic development.116 The main areas under opium poppy cultivation in 2017 continued to be in the states that form part of the Sierra Madre Occidental, i.e., the states near the Gulf of California, in particular Sinaloa, Durango, Chihuahua and Nayarit, as well as further south, in the states of the Sierra Madre del Sur, which are located along the Pacific Coast, in particular the 115 UNODC and Mexico, M\u00e9xico: Monitoreo de Cultivos de Amapola 2015-2016 y 2016-2017 (November 2018). 116 Ibid.declined in 2018 to an estimated 520 tons (7 per cent of global opium production), its lowest level since 2010. Almost 90 per cent of the opium poppy in Myan- mar continued to be cultivated in Shan State, while most of the remainder was cultivated in neighbour - ing Kachin State, in the north of the country. Smaller pockets of opium poppy cultivation were also found in Kayah State, in the south, and in Chin State, in the west. 113 The most marked declines in opium poppy cultivation in Myanmar in 2018 were in areas with a comparatively good security situa - tion. There were also declines in parts of North Shan and Kachin states, where there had been a protracted state of conflict in recent years and central govern- ment control is limited. Apart from the security situation, a number of struc - tural vulnerabilities are frequently associated with opium poppy cultivation in Myanmar, such as income inequality, lack of employment opportuni- ties and of infrastructure, such as access to markets and availability of health clinics. Those vulnerabili - ties continued to play a role in the areas where there is a high concentration of opium poppy cultivation. Moreover, the presence of organized crime groups in those areas is also associated with the manufacture and trafficking of heroin.114 Lower opium prices might also have played a role, as in the period 2015- 2018 farm-gate prices of dry opium decreased by around 45 per cent in Myanmar, possibly a conse- quence of a shift from the use of opiates to the use of synthetic drugs, particularly methamphetamine, in several parts of East and South-East Asia.

Based on forensic profiling, United States authorities estimated that in 2016, 86 per cent of the heroin analysed (744 samples taken from 1.6 tons of heroin seized in the United States) had originated in Mexico, up from 20 per cent in 2006.120 Most indicators point to an expansion of the heroin 119 M\u00e9xico: Monitoreo de Cultivos de Amapola 2015-2016 y 2016-2017.

Reports suggest a shift in the activities of organized crime groups in Mexico as cannabis grown in the country appears to have lost its competitive advan- tage in the United States market, where the production of high-quality cannabis has been on the increase following the legalization of cannabis supply for recreational use in several states.118 The reported increase in the area under opium poppy cultivation in Mexico went in parallel with 117 Ibid. 118 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment.Map 5 Opium poppy cultivation density in Mexico, 2016-2017 Source: UNODC and Mexico, Mexico: Monitoreo de Cultivos de Amapola 2015 2016 y 2016 2017 (November 2018).

Opiate seizures increased to new record levels in 2017 and remained concentrated in Asia, especially in South-West Asia In 2017, quantities of opiates seized globally reached an all-time high, with a 5 per cent increase from the previous year in the quantity of opium seized (to 693 tons), a 13 per cent increase in heroin seized (to 103 tons) and a 33 per cent increase in morphine seized (to 87 tons). Expressed in common heroin equivalents, heroin seizures continued to exceed those of morphine and opium in 2017. Most seizures of opiates continued to be reported in, or close to, the main opium production areas. Thus, with more than 90 per cent of global illicit opium production taking place in Asia, the region accounted for 86 per cent of all quantities of opiates seized (expressed in heroin equivalents) in 2017. 123 Notwithstanding possible changes in heroin purity seizures (not accounted for in the calculation).market in the United States in recent years:121 overall, heroin seizures in the country more than tripled between 2006 and 2016, to 7.1 tons, then increased further, to 8.1 tons in 2017, while the number of heroin-related deaths in the United States rose sevenfold over the period 2007-2017, or, excluding the involvement of other, synthetic opioids, fourfold.122 Opium production has been fluctuating greatly but global opiate seizures have increased steadily over the past two decades At the global level, annual opium production has been fluctuating more than annual heroin seizures and global opiate use, suggesting the existence of opium inventories. By offsetting fluctuations in opium production, such inventories appear to ensure a smooth supply of heroin to the main consumer markets and explain the comparatively smaller year- on-year changes in heroin seizures.

The majority of heroin and morphine sei- zures in that subregion continued to be reported by China, which accounted for 72 per cent of all such seizures in the subregion in 2017. In South Asia, a marked increase, most notably in India, in the quantities of heroin and morphine seized has been reported in recent years. With increases of 34 per cent in 2016 and 51 per cent in 2017, the subregion now accounts for almost 2 per cent of the global total quantities of heroin and morphine seized. The largest quantities of heroin and morphine seized outside Asia are reported in Europe (13 per cent of the global total), followed by the Americas (5 per cent), two important markets for heroin. In Europe, the quantities of heroin and morphine seized more than doubled in 2017, to 24 tons, back to the level reported in the first decade of the new millennium. The increase in Europe was primarily the consequence of a tripling in the quantities of heroin and morphine seized in South-East Europe, notably in T urkey and, to a lesser extent, Bulgaria and other countries along the Balkan route. Quantities of heroin and morphine seized in West and Central Europe rose by 29 per cent in 2017 The vast majority of those opiates continued to be seized in the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia in 2017 (79 per cent of global opiates seized, expressed in common heroin equivalents), particu- larly opium (97 per cent of global opium seizures) and morphine (99 per cent of global morphine seizures). Accounting for 39per cent of the global total, the largest quantity of opiates (expressed in heroin equivalents) continued to be seized in the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2017, followed by Afghanistan (26 per cent) and Pakistan (14 per cent). The next largest seizures of opiates were reported by T urkey (7 per cent), the United States and China (4 per cent each). Quantities of heroin and morphine seized continue to increase in all regions except Oceania The quantities of heroin and morphine intercepted in Asia more than doubled in 2016 and increased by a further 14 per cent in 2017. This primarily reflected increases in the quantities of morphine and heroin seized in the Near and Middle East/South- West Asia, a consequence of marked increases in Afghan opiate production in 2016 and 2017, as well as ongoing law enforcement operations in those subregions.

This is in line with the ongoing decline, by 64 per cent in 2017 (or by 78 per cent since 2014), reported in the quantities of heroin and morphine seized in Central Asia and T ranscau - casia, the main transit area for heroin shipments to the market in the Russian Federation. The quantities of heroin and morphine seized in the Americas rose by 9 per cent in 2017, to 9.5 tons, almost three times the quantity seized a decade ear - lier. Seizures made in North America accounted for 90 per cent of all the heroin and morphine inter - cepted in the Americas, with 85 per cent being seized from the previous year, with increases reported by most countries. Seizures in the subregion nonetheless remained clearly below the annual average reported over the past decade. The largest seizures in the subregion in 2017 were reported by the Netherlands, followed by the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain. By contrast, the quantities of heroin and morphine seized continued to decline in Eastern Europe for the third year in a row, falling by 48 per cent in 2017 (or by 85 per cent since 2014), mainly as a result of a decline in the quantities seized in the Fig. 21 Distribution of global quantities of heroin and morphine seized in 2017 (total = 190 tons) Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire, and other sourcesEurope 13%Americas 5%Africa 1%Oceania East Asia 7% Other Asia 2%Asia 81% Fig. 22 Quantities of heroin and morphine seized, by region, 2007-2017 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire data and other Government sources.05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,000 020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000140,000 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Asia Europe, Americas, Africa and Oceania KilogramsKilograms Near and Middle East/South-West Asia South-East Asia Other Asia Europe Americas Africa Oceania38 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2019DEPRESSANTStrafficked from Afghanistan to markets in neigh - bouring countries (in particular the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Central Asian countries and India), to Europe, the Near and Middle East, South Asia, Africa and, to a lesser extent, South-East Asia, North America and Oceania. Some 88 per cent of the global total of heroin and morphine seized in 2017 was related to Afghan opiate production, up from 73 per cent in 2015. Nearly all opiates seized in Europe, Central Asia and Africa are derived from opium originating in Afghanistan; that country accounted for 100 per cent of all mentions of the \"country of origin\" of opiates seized in Central Asia, 96 per cent of mentions by authorities in Europe and 84 per cent of mentions in Africa over the period 2013-2017.124 Heroin is also trafficked from production areas in South-East Asia (Myanmar and, to a lesser extent, the Lao People's Democratic Republic) to markets in East and South-East Asia and Oceania. In the Americas, heroin manufactured in Latin America (notably Mexico, and, to a far lesser extent, Colom- bia and Guatemala) accounts for most of the heroin 124 For details of calculation, see the online methodology section. in the United States, followed by Colombia, Ecua- dor, Mexico, Canada and Guatemala. Despite a 31 per cent increase in 2017 and a four- fold increase compared with a decade ago, the quantities of heroin and morphine seized in Africa remained comparatively low, at 1.5 tons, in 2017. Most seizures continue to be reported in North Africa, which accounted for nearly two thirds of all quantities of heroin and morphine seized in Africa in 2017, and in East Africa (21 per cent). Egypt is the country where most such seizures have been reported in Africa, reflecting the trafficking of opi- ates via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, followed by the United Republic of Tanzania, South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria. The quantities of heroin and morphine seized in Oceania decreased in 2017 for the second year in a row, to the lowest level since 2009, with more than 99 per cent being seized in Australia. Trafficking in opiates continues to be dominated by opiates originating in Afghanistan Reflecting the increasing dominance of opium pro - duction in Afghanistan, most opiates worldwide are Map 6 Significant individual heroin seizures, January 2013-April 2019 Source: UNODC and Paris Pact, Drugs Monitoring Platform.

Although some heroin may transit Pakistan for sub - sequent trafficking along the Balkan route, some heroin is also trafficked directly from Pakistan, either by air or sea to Europe; this has been mainly reported by the United Kingdom, Denmark and Italy and, to a lesser extent, by Greece, Spain, France and Bel - gium in recent years. Pakistan reported 32 tons seized in 2017, up from a low of 4 tons (4 per cent of the global total) in 2009. The main destination countries, based on seizures made by the Pakistani authorities in 2017, were, in Europe, the United Kingdom and, on the Arabian Peninsula, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. In addition, opiates are smuggled via Pakistan and via the Islamic Republic of Iran for onward trafficking along the Balkan route. The Islamic Republic of Iran reported that 80 per cent of the morphine and 85 per cent of the heroin seized on its territory in 2017 had been smuggled into the country via Pakistan, with only the remainder having been smuggled directly from Afghanistan into the Islamic Republic of Iran. Smaller amounts of heroin were also seized on the \"Caucasus route\" and along the Black Sea. This deviation of the Balkan route goes from the Islamic supply to the United States and also supplies the comparatively limited heroin market in South America. Most opiates continue to be trafficked from Afghanistan along the Balkan route and its various branches Based on seizures, the world's single largest heroin trafficking route continues to be the Balkan route, along which opiates are smuggled from Afghanistan to the Islamic Republic of Iran, T urkey, and the Balkan countries to various destinations in Western and Central Europe. Excluding seizures made in Afghanistan, countries along the Balkan route accounted for 47 per cent of the global quantities of heroin and morphine seized in 2017, with a fur- ther 4 per cent reported by countries in Western and Central Europe. Opiates are either trafficked along the eastern branch of the Balkan route from T urkey to Bulgaria and then onward to Romania and Hungary, or along the western branch from Bulgaria to various western Balkan countries and from there to Western and Central Europe. More than three quarters of the mentions of countries of origin, departure and tran - sit of heroin in the annual report questionnaire submitted by countries in Western and Central Europe over the period 2013-2017 referred to Fig. 23 Distribution of global quantities of heroin and morphine seized, by main trafficking routes, 2007-2017a Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. a The Balkan route: Islamic Republic of Iran, half of Transcaucasia, South-Eastern Europe; the southern route: South Asia, Gulf countries and other countries in the Near and Middle East and Africa; the northern route: Central Asia, Eastern Europe and half of Transcaucasia.

Italy reported limited trafficking of heroin via Qatar, Oman and South Africa, while Spain and Portugal reported some traf - ficking via Mozambique. Some of the heroin trafficked along the southern route is also destined for domestic consumption in various countries located along the route, in par - ticular Pakistan, as well as countries on the Arabian Peninsula and in East and Southern Africa. While there is some domestic production of opiates in India for the illicit market, India reported that 53 per cent of all the heroin seized on its territory in 2017 came from Pakistan and just 0.4 per cent originated in Myanmar. India also reported an almost sixfold increase in the quantity of heroin seized that originated in South-West Asia, which was linked to an increase in maritime trafficking. The bulk of the heroin smuggled into India in 2017 arrived by boat (88 per cent) with smaller amounts smuggled across land borders (12 per cent), often by heroin parcels being thrown over border fences along the border between Pakistan and India or being hidden in farming equipment transported to India on trucks. Heroin of South-West Asian origin seized in India was reported to be of higher purity (54 per cent on average) than other heroin seized in the country in 2017. Countries in South-West Asia and South Asia (Paki - stan, followed by Afghanistan, India and the Islamic Republic of Iran) were also the most frequently men - tioned countries of origin, departure and transit of heroin shipped to Africa (as mentioned by African countries). The above-mentioned Asian countries accounted for 91 per cent of all such mentions of Asian countries over the period 2013-2017, with the remaining 9 per cent accounted for by countries in South-East Asia (Thailand, the Lao People's Dem - ocratic Republic and Myanmar). T ransit via the United Republic of Tanzania, followed by Nigeria and Kenya, was the most frequently mentioned tran - sit route through Africa over the period 2013-2017 at the global level, though African countries also mentioned trans-shipment through Uganda, Ethio - pia, Madagascar and South Africa. While heroin is often smuggled to East Africa by sea (80 per cent of the total reported by Kenya in Republic of Iran to the Caucasus countries (Azer - baijan, Armenia and Georgia) across the Black Sea to Ukraine and then by land to Romania for onward trafficking along the eastern branch of the Balkan route to Central and Western Europe. This route increased in importance for several years, with sei- zures of heroin and morphine rising from 0.7 tons in 2007 to 1.8 tons in 2014, before falling to 1.3 tons in 2016 and 0.4 tons in 2017, compared with 18 tons of heroin and morphine seized in T urkey, 0.9 tons seized in Bulgaria and 0.4 tons seized in Greece in 2017. While seizures in T urkey, Bulgaria and Greece increased in 2017, they decreased in countries affected by trafficking via the Black Sea. The decrease in 2017 resulted from a marked reduc - tion in seizures reported by Azerbaijan and Georgia, which was not offset by the increase in seizures reported by Armenia, Ukraine, Romania and the Republic of Moldova. The \"Caucasus route\" has also been used to supply heroin to markets in the Russian Federation, although to a lesser extent than the northern route (via Central Asia).125 Heroin continues to be trafficked along a complex array of routes running south from Afghanistan The southern route encompasses an array of differ- ent routes along which opiates are smuggled from Afghanistan via Pakistan or the Islamic Republic of Iran for onward trafficking to the Near and Middle East, Africa and Europe, to India for onward traf- ficking to neighbouring countries (Sri Lanka and Bangladesh) and to North America (notably Canada), as well as to South-East Asia and Oceania. Countries along the southern route accounted for, on average, 4 per cent of global heroin and morphine seizures (excluding seizures made in Afghanistan) over the period 2013-2017, including in 2017. T rafficking of heroin along the southern route has been referred to in 9 per cent of mentions of coun- tries of origin, departure or transit by countries in Western and Central Europe. The latest data reported suggest that in 2017 trafficking via the southern route played a key role for only one 125 UNODC and Afghan Opiate T rade Project, \"Short update: the route\" (Vienna, 2019) (forthcoming).41 small extent, to countries neighbouring the Russian Federation such as Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia and Ukraine, as well as of small amounts of heroin smug - gled into the Russian Federation, in particular the Kaliningrad Oblast (an exclave between Poland and Lithuania), via countries in the European Union. The trafficking of heroin to the Russian Federation is carried out predominantly via the northern route. Its importance seems to have been declining, however: 10 per cent of global quantities of heroin and morphine were seized along the route in 2008, whereas the proportion decreased to 1 per cent in 2017; it is noteworthy that over the past decade there has also been a decline in the number of registered opiate users in Central Asia and the Russian Federation. In 2015, the Russian Federation estimated that 80 per cent of the heroin seized in the country had originated in Afghanistan and had been trafficked via Central Asia into the Russian Federation, while 20 per cent had departed from Pakistan and was probably trafficked via the Islamic 2014 and 50 per cent by Madagascar in 2016), heroin trafficking to countries in Southern and West Africa seems to be more common by air (75 per cent of the total in South Africa in 2017, 99 per cent of the total in Nigeria in 2017 and 100 per cent of the total in Ghana in 2016). Similarly, most outbound heroin trafficking by countries in Southern and West Africa seems to be by air. The main heroin trans-shipment countries on the Arabian Peninsula, both globally and for countries in Africa, were the United Arab Emirates and Qatar over the period 2013-2017. Relative importance of the northern route continues to decline The northern route continues to be used to smug- gle heroin from Afghanistan via Central Asia to markets in that subregion as well as to the Russian Federation, the main destination market. There are also reports of heroin trafficking, although to a very Recent heroin seizures in Africa Overall, seizures suggest that the trafficking of heroin via Africa appears to have increased between 2013, when less than 0.5 tons of heroin was seized, and 2017, when almost 1.5 tons were seized, with 2018 seizures suggesting that it may have increased further since then. The Egyptian authorities seized 1,350 kg of heroin in the exclusive eco- nomic zone of the Red Sea in April 2018 and 2,147 kg (including 99 kg of crystal methamphetamine) in April 2019.a In May 2018, the Combined Maritime Forces seized 260 kg of heroin on a dhow in the exclusive economic zone of the United Republic of Tanzania; overall, 1.63 tons of heroin were seized over the period July 2017-June 2018 by the Combined Maritime Task Force in various operations in the Indian Ocean when searching ships bound for, or planning to transit, the United Republic of Tanzania.b Moreover, in October 2018, the National Coast Guard of Mauritius seized 125 kg of heroin in Coin de Mire, Mauritius. A number of smaller heroin seizures were also reported by Kenya in 2018, most notably on the coast near Mombasa, and by the Seychelles, Madagascar, Zambia and Mozambique.c The authorities of Mozambique reported frequent trafficking of heroin from Pakistan to Kenya and from there to Mozambique, most notably Maputo, for onward trafficking to Johannesburg in South Africa.d A number of reports suggest that heroin trafficking activities to Mozambique for onward trafficking to South Africa may have gained in importance in recent years.e a UNODC and Paris Pact, Drugs Monitoring Platform. b T wenty-eighth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Africa, \"Country report: United Republic of Tanzania\", UNODC/HONLAF/28/CRP .16, Dar es Salaam, (17-21 September 2018). c UNODC and Paris Pact, Drugs Monitoring Platform. d T wenty-eighth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Africa. \"Country report: Mozambique: Situation of Illicit Drug T rafficking in Mozambique\", UNODC/HONLAF/28/CRP .7, Dar es Salaam, (17-21 September e Joseph Hanlon, \"The Uberization of Mozambique's heroin trade\", London School of Economics (Working Paper Series 2018, No. 18-190, July 2018); Nampula, Africa is heroin's new highway to the West, The Economist, (31 January 2019). 3Supply of opiates42 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2019DEPRESSANTS Map 7 Main heroin trafficking routes as described by reported seizures, 2013-2017 Sources: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire and individual drug seizure database. *A darker shade indicates a larger amount of heroin being seized with the country as transit/destination.

Most of this trafficking takes place within North America, i.e., from Mexico to the United States and, to a far lesser extent, from Colombia and Guatemala (typically via Mexico) to the United States. Analysis of wholesale seizures of heroin in the United States has shown the increasing predominance of heroin originating in Mexico over the past decade, which accounted for over 80 per cent of the heroin samples analysed in 2016. This does not include the 14 per cent that was classified as \"inconclusive South American\", i.e., consisting of white powder heroin processed using the \"South American method\", with no means of linking the samples to heroin originat - ing either in Colombia or Mexico. In parallel, the proportion of heroin originating in South America (mostly Colombia), which appears to have been predominant until 2010, has since been decreasing (4 per cent in 2016). Data on retail trafficking in metropolitan areas confirm the shift to the predomi - nance of heroin from Mexico, not only in the western areas of the country but also in the eastern areas, which until 2014 appear to have been dominated by heroin originating in South America. 130 In the United States market, the presence of heroin from Asia has become minimal: heroin from South-West Asia was identified in less than 1 per cent of samples in 2016, while heroin from 128 Ibid. 129 Ibid. 130 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment.Republic of Iran and Azerbaijan into the Russian Federation. In subsequent years, however, Pakistan was no longer reported to be a major country of departure for heroin shipments intercepted in the Russian Federation. The main transit countries for heroin found in the Russian Federation in 2016 were in Central Asia (notably Tajikistan and Kazakhstan) and the Caucasus (notably Azerbaijan), with reports in 2017 suggesting that, in the context of ongoing decreases in heroin shipments to the Russian Federation, there may have been an overall decrease in trafficking along the northern route and a concentration via Central Asia, notably via Kazakhstan (50 per cent of all identified shipments in transit) and Uzbekistan (30 per cent). Decline in heroin trafficking linked to a decline in opium production in East and South-East Asia, but the subregion remains the main source of opiates for Oceania On the basis of seized amounts, the largest non- Afghan-related opiate trafficking activities are of opiates produced in South-East Asia (mostly Myan - mar), which are trafficked to other markets in East and South-East Asia (mostly China and Thailand) and to Oceania (mostly Australia). Seizures made in those countries accounted for 11 per cent of the total global quantities of heroin and morphine seized (excluding seizures reported by Afghanistan) in 2017. This represents a decrease from 2015 when the share was 15 per cent. The decrease went in parallel with a reported decline in opium produc - tion in Myanmar of 37 per cent over the period 2013-2017.126 Despite the recent decline in opium production in Myanmar, the Australian authorities, based on a detailed analysis of bulk weight border seizures, reported that the proportion of heroin of South-East Asian origin seized increased from a low of 26 per cent in 2008 to more than 99 per cent over the period January-June 2017.127 Nonetheless, in line 126 This is based on changes in opium production reported from Shan and Kachin States (UNODC and Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control, Myanmar Opium Survey 2017 (December 2017, p. iv). 127 Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, Illicit Drug Data Report 2016-17 (Canberra, 2018).44 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2019DEPRESSANTSSupply of pharmaceutical opioids Licit and illicit manufacture of pharmaceutical opioids The supply of pharmaceutical opioids to illicit drug markets for non-medical use may occur in the form of diversion from licit sources and from illicit pro- duction. Diversion can take place in various ways: the purchase of pharmaceutical opioids - often in preparations (such as cough syrups containing codeine) - for non-medical purposes in drug stores and pharmacies, which are subsequently re-sold on the black market; theft from hospitals or pharmacy stocks; the diversion of shipments from the licit trade at the wholesale level or at the import/export level when crossing borders mainly by means of false declarations;individuals can also access the licit supply of pharmaceuticals to obtain substances through doctor shopping, that is, obtaining prescrip - tions from several different doctors. The most widely manufactured licit opioids at the global level in 2017, in descending order, were the three main opium alkaloids directly derived from the poppy plant: morphine, codeine and the - baine.133, 134 The global production of morphine and codeine has remained largely stable over the past two dec - ades; however, production of thebaine has risen sixfold and increased demand for thebaine-rich poppy plant material has been reported. Although thebaine is not used for therapeutic purposes, it is required as a starting material in the manufacture of a number of semi-synthetic opioids, including oxycodone, oxymorphone and buprenorphine. In most years, the United States has been the main manufacturer of oxycodone, hydrocodone and of the other thebaine-related substances, except for buprenorphine.135 133 Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019. 134 Although all of these substances are directly extracted from opium or from poppy straw, codeine is also manufactured from morphine or thebaine, while thebaine is also partly manufactured from oripavine, another alkaloid of the poppy plant (see, INCB, Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019). 135 Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019, and previous years.South-East Asia, the main source of heroin over the period 1988-1994,131 is likely to have disappeared from the United States market. The last shipment of heroin in the United States found to have originated in South-East Asia was in 2005, with no sample of heroin originating in that subregion having been identified since then in wholesale-level seizures.132 By contrast, heroin found in Canada is mostly of Afghan origin, with transit through Pakistan and India, and also through the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, transit through Africa (South Africa and United Republic of Tanzania) and Europe (Belgium, Netherlands and Germany) were reported over the period 2013-2017. In South America, Central America and the Carib- bean, heroin markets continue to be supplied mainly with heroin from Colombia, with transits through a number of countries within those subregions (2013-2017). However, a number of indicators sug - gest that those heroin markets remain relatively small. 131 United States, DEA, 2014 National Drug Threat Assessment (November 2014). 132 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment.Fig. 24 Origin of heroin seized at the wholesale level in the United States, 2000-2016 Source: United States, DEA, 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment 2018.0102030405060708090100 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016Percentage Inconclusive South America South America South-West Asia South-East Asia Mexico45 Supply of pharmaceutical opioids 32013-2017, the quantity manufactured globally per year amounted, on average, to less than 1 ton (929 kg in 2017),137 which is only a minor fraction of the average total quantity of heroin estimated to have been illicitly manufactured (540 tons per year)138 and seized (88 tons per year) over that period. This adds weight to the hypothesis that diversions from the licit market, if occurring, are a negligible contributor to the supply of heroin to illicit markets. 137 Ibid. 138 UNODC estimate based on UNODC opium poppy cultivation surveys.Given the role of the main natural opium alkaloids in the manufacture of various semi-synthetic opioids dihydrocodeine a large number of semi-synthetic opioids (including heroin) are also manufactured from morphine - wholesale quantities of those alkaloids sold to pharmacies, hospitals and medical doctors, i.e. opi - oids available for consumption, are far smaller than the actual quantities manufactured. It should also be noted that in a few cases, in particular of codeine and dihydrocodeine, amounts available for con - sumption have been dominated by the sale of preparations of these substances,136 which are subject to less strict controls at the international level, and thus usually at the national level. The licit manufacture of heroin takes place, mainly in Switzerland and the United Kingdom, to supply people enrolled in heroin-assisted treatment pro - grammes in those countries as well as in a number of other countries, including Canada, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. During the period 136 Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019.Fig. 25 Global quantities of the main opium alkaloids manufactured in 2017 and trends over the period 1998-2017 Source: Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements and previous years.Fig. 26 Licit manufacture consump- 2017 2017 (E/INCB/2018/2). Note: The large differences in the manufacture of morphine and the amounts of morphine available for consumption result from the fact that roughly 88 per cent of the morphine manufactured globally is converted into other narcotic drugs, mostly codeine, which is in turn used for the manufacture of various preparations, notably cough medication (89 per cent), or into substances not covered by the 1961 Convention. The remaining morphine is used directly for medical purposes, of preparations to pharmacies, hospitals and doctors Wholesale sales of medicaments to pharmacies, hospitals and doctors ManufactureManufacture Wholesale sales of preparations to pharmacies, hospitals and doctors Wholesale sales of medicaments to pharmacies, hospitals and doctors0100200300400500600700 050100150200250300350 2017 1998 2012 the largest manufacturer country of licit fentanyl worldwide (2017 and previous years),140 some diver - sion of fentanyl from domestic licit manufacture also seems to occur, mostly for personal use and street sales in the country.141 The large market for tramadol of non-medical use in North Africa and the Near and Middle East also seems to be supplied by tramadol specifically manu - factured and trafficked for the illegal market, but information remains limited. The diversion of phar- maceutical opioids such as codeine and oxycodone from the licit to the illicit market is evident in North America. Outside that subregion diversions of phar- maceutical opioids are not reported in large quantities, but that could be the result of underre- porting or the limited capacity of law enforcement authorities to detect diversions. There is a gap in knowledge about the supply chain of codeine that is reportedly being used non-medically across many subregions. The fact that the global quantities of codeine seized are far smaller than those licitly man - ufactured at the global level, coupled with a lack of evidence of the existence of illicit laboratories for codeine manufacture, suggests that the non-medical use of codeine is largely supplied by the legal market. It is unclear, however, how and at what stage the supply of codeine for medical use is diverted for non-medical use. There may be a combination of scenarios, with some codeine preparations being easy to access for non-medical use in pharmacies or other types of outlet and diversion taking place before the drug reaches the retail market, resulting in a large proportion of the licit supply been diverted to the illicit market. Amounts of pharmaceutical opioids available for consumption Amounts of opiates and synthetic opioids (expressed in daily doses) available for consumption globally more than doubled over the period 1998- 2010, followed by a period of stabilization and a decline over the period 2014- 2017. This sharp increase mainly reflected an increase in the United States, where the increase over the period 1998-2010 was a consequence of initial reports suggesting that there had been insufficient access to pain medication for 140 Ibid. 141 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment. Likewise, most of the morphine found on illicit markets originates from illicitly produced opium, and only small quantities of morphine are likely to be diverted from licit manufacture to illicit markets. In fact, there is no evidence of large-scale diversion. Over the period 2013-2017, 4,417 cases of diver- sion of morphine (665,000 units, or 67 kg) were reported, while the overall number of reported sei- zure cases of \"illicit morphine\" was almost twice that figure (8,135 seizures of 221 tons). Moreover, while the majority of the licit manufacture of mor- phine takes place in France, followed by the United Kingdom and Australia,139 nearly all of the mor - phine seized has been intercepted in South-West Asia, which is also the subregion where most of the opium destined for illegal markets is produced and where most clandestine morphine and heroin labo- ratories have been dismantled. Compared with the 234 clandestine heroin labora- tories (most of them in Afghanistan) reported by 14 countries over the period 2013- 2017, only a few clandestine laboratories manufacturing other opioids were dismantled over the same period, including a few laboratories manufacturing morphine (India and Mexico), methadone (Belarus, Latvia and the Russian Federation), desomorphine (Russian Fed - eration), codeine (Czechia) and monoacetylmorphine (Austria). Data that can help explain whether other pharma- ceutical opioids are diverted from the licit to the illicit market or are illicitly produced at source are limited, although this varies depending on the sub - stance and region. In the case of fentanyl, for example, evidence suggests that the bulk of the sub- stance found on the illicit market comes from illicit manufacture, although some small diversions of fen - tanyl have been reported in the United States. The clandestine manufacture of pharmaceutical opioids concerns fentanyl and its analogues. A number of laboratories have been found manufacturing fenta- nyl and analogues in recent years in Australia, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Germany, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Slovakia, Sweden and the United States. At the same time, most of the illicit supply, based on reports by Member States, appears to have originated in illicitly operating labo - ratories in China. However, as the United States is 139 Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019.47 Supply of pharmaceutical opioids 3from far lower levels - were also observed in most other regions, except Africa.148 The initial strategy of marketing \"new opiates\" as having very low addiction potential, however, turned out to be harmful.149, 150, 151 Reports of an increase in the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids as well as in related drug use disorders and health 148 Progress in Ensuring Adequate Access to Internationally Controlled Substances for Medical and Scientific Purposes (E/INCB/2018/1/Supp.1). 149 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Pain Management and the Opioid Epidemic: Balancing Societal and Individual Benefits and Risks of Prescription Opioid Use (Washington, D. C., The National Academies Press, 2017).patients suffering from severe pain, and the view that few people would develop dependence on that type of medication if taken in a medical environment,142, 143 together with the broadening of applications and an increase in the demand for some opioids, including fentanyl.144 Most of the increase in the amounts of pharmaceu - tical opioids available for consumption over the period 1998- 2010 was not, however, of \"traditional\" opiates such as codeine and morphine; they increased in line with overall growth in opioid wholesale sales. The bulk of that increase was in the United States in wholesale sales of \"new opiates\"145 marketed in the past as having less potential for addiction, sub- stances used in substitution treatment and some synthetic opioids, notably fentanyl.146 The strong increases in the amounts available for consumption included oxycodone (which experienced tenfold growth over the period), hydromorphone (fivefold growth), hydrocodone (threefold growth) and oxy - morphone (46,000-fold growth). Substances used in substitution treatment for heroin-dependent people also saw strong increases in the amounts available for consumption. This applied to both methadone (threefold growth) and buprenorphine (11-fold growth). Amounts available for consump- tion of fentanyl rose ninefold over the period 1998-2010.147 While most of the increase in the availability of opioids for consumption over this period reflected increases in North America, some increases - starting 142 Russell Portenoy and Kathleen Foley, \"Chronic use of opioid analgesics in non-malignant pain: report of 38 cases\", Pain, vol. 25, No. 2 (May 1986), pp. 171-186. 143 Gary M.

This 154 United States, Food and Drug Administration, Drug Safety and Availability, \"FDA drug safety communication: FDA recommends against the continued use of propoxyphene\", 19 November 2010. 155 INCB, Narcotics Report 2018, (New York, 2019).consequences prompted authorities in North Amer - ica to gradually strengthen the overall control system and warn medical doctors of the dependence poten - tial of these substances and against overprescribing in order to avoid diversion. This in turn led to a period of stabilization, at a high level, of the licit manufacture and availability for consumption of internationally controlled pharma- ceutical opioids over the period 2010-2014, followed by a period of moderate decline (around 10 per cent) at the global level over the period 2014- 2017, as opioid-related harm continued to worsen and controls were further tightened in North Amer - ica. The recent decline at the global level was mostly prompted by reductions in amounts of opioids avail - able for consumption reported in North America, although declines in 2017 from the previous year were also reported from South America, East and South-East Asia, West and Central Europe and Africa.152 Since 2014, the decline in the amounts of opiates available for consumption has been particularly pro - nounced in the case of opiates, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone and hydromorphone, which had found their way on to the illicit markets, particularly in North America. Despite this decline, North America continued to account in 2017 for a major share of global amounts available for consumption of hydro - morphone (72 per cent), oxycodone (73 per cent) and hydromorphone (99 per cent).153 Some of the other synthetic opioids, such as pethi- dine, continued declining (69 per cent over the period 1998- 2017) and amounts available for con- sumption of dextropropoxyphene, which was very popular in the 1990s, fell by more than 99 per cent over the past two decades following requests by the United States authorities not to prescribe it any 150 Wilson M.

However, as with other pharmaceutical opioids, there are large differences in the global consumption patterns of buprenor - phine and methadone for medical purposes, as seen in the coverage of opioid-agonist treatment for people with opioid use disorders.156 In more general terms, although they have declined in recent years, amounts of pharmaceutical opioids available for consumption remain at a very high level - expressed in standard defined daily doses (S-DDD) per million inhabitants - in North Amer - ica, followed by Oceania and Europe. By contrast, the level continues to be extremely low in most developing countries, notably in South Asia and in Africa.157 While the comparatively high level of sales and the availability of pharmaceutical opioids in North America may point to over-prescription prac - tices in the subregion, data indicate that a number of countries in the developing world continue to 156 See, for example, World Drug Report 2018. 157 Narcotics Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019.Fig. 30 Trends in availability of opioid analgesics for consumption, by region, 1994-2016 Source: Progress in Ensuring Adequate Access to Internation- ally Controlled Substances for Medical and Scientific Purposes (E/INCB/2018/1/Supp.1).

This includes thefts from manufacturing laboratories and wholesalers, sales of prescriptions to unauthorized persons, thefts from hospitals and doctor's surgeries, and diversion from international trade. The diversion of pharma - ceutical opioids from licit sources was reported in all five regions, but the majority of cases (90 per cent) over the past two decades were reported by countries in North America, a subregion where avail - ability for consumption of pharmaceutical opioids is at the highest per-capita level.160 The number of reported diversions of pharmaceutical opioids fluc- tuated greatly over the period, mostly because of 158 Regions as defined by INCB. 159 Progress in Ensuring Adequate Access to Internationally Controlled Substances for Medical and Scientific Purposes (E/ INCB/2018/1/Supp.1). 160 Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019.reporting practices, in particular in North America, rather than year-on-year changes in the number of diversions. A total of 63 different pharmaceutical opioids have been reported in diversions since 1998. In terms of the number of cases in which each substance is involved, which mainly reflects diversions reported by countries in North America over the past two decades, oxycodone tops the list, followed by hydrocodone, morphine, hydromorphone and codeine. In 2017, however, reflecting a number of indicators that suggest growth in the illegal market for fentanyl in North America, most reported diver - sions were of fentanyl, followed by morphine and tramadol. For most substances, reported seizures are far more important than reported diversions, both in terms of cases and even more so in terms of quantities seized. Seizures of pharmaceutical opioids Seizure data show the distinct problems that each region faces in relation to the non-medical use of opioids: the illicit market for non-medical use of opioids is dominated by tramadol in Africa, codeine in Asia and fentanyl in North America. Those regions also experience different challenges in Fig. 33 Trends in availability of opioid analgesics for consumption, Europe, 1994-2016 Source: Progress in Ensuring Adequate Access to Internation- ally Controlled Substances for Medical and Scientific Purposes (E/INCB/2018/1/Supp.1).

Until 2009, only small quantities of pharmaceutical opioids were seized each year at the global level (an average of 116 kg per year over the period 1998- 2008). Those quantities increased, however, to an annual average of 6.3 tons over the period 2009- 2013. In 2014, the amount seized reached a record high of 203 tons; since then, despite fluctuations, the amount seized has remained at a high level, exceeding global seizures of heroin every year, except in 2016. In 2017, 150 tons of pharmaceutical opi- oids were intercepted worldwide, more than 1,000 times the quantity of opioids reported in diversion cases, which accounted for 47 kg, 72 litres and 61,000 units of different opioids. In 2017, the increase, compared with that in 2016, was particu- larly marked in the case of fentanyl (sixfold increase) and methadone (fivefold increase). By contrast, global quantities of oxycodone and hydrocodone seized in 2017 decreased by 92 per cent and 47 per Fig. 35 Global quantities of pharmaceutical opioids seized Source: UNODC, responses to the 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Kilogram equivalents Africa Americas Asia Europe OceaniaB.

Expressed in S-DDD, as defined by INCB,164 seizures of pharmaceutical opi- oids were, however, dominated by fentanyl and its analogues in both 2016 and 2017 (over 80 per cent in 2017), followed by tramadol (11 per cent). This reflects the fact that fentanyl is about 100 times more potent than morphine.165 Such comparisons may be misleading, however, as the purity of the various substances may differ. While some of the products diverted from licit channels may be com- pletely pure, like any licit pharmaceutical drug, fentanyl(s) seized in the United States were found to have been heavily adulterated (average purity of 5.1 per cent in 2017).166 Trafficking in tramadol continues to grow in importance T ramadol is not under international control, even though it is under national control in many coun- tries in Africa, the Middle East, Europe and North America. It has been considered for critical review by the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence six times over the past three decades: in 1992, 2000, 2002, 2006, 2014 and 2018.167 T ramadol is widely used in medicine and was originally manufactured in Germany in 1977 then, some 20 years later, in other industrialized countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.168 It is not clear if, and to what extent, tramadol found in the illicit markets has been diverted from licit channels or to what extent is has been illicitly manufactured. Some high dosage packaging found on illicit markets in Africa169 suggest that there is specialized manufacturing to supply the illegal market, but more extensive research is required to improve understanding of 164 Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019. 165 Ibid. 166 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment. 167 WHO, \"Annex 1: extract from the report of the forty-first meeting of the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence\". 168 World Drug Report 2018. 169 Ibid.cent, respectively, from the previous year. That might have been linked to a number of factors that mainly affected the United States market, including a decline in the licit manufacture and the amounts of those substances available for consumption,161, 162 and reduced demand (see page 16 of the present booklet) - for example, the implementation of pre - scription drug monitoring programmes, which track the prescription and dispensation of controlled pre - scription drugs to patients163 - which resulted in fewer opportunities for trafficking and, conse - quently, for diversion and seizures. In recent years, 59 per cent of the total quantity of pharmaceutical opioids seized over the period 2013- 2017 was intercepted in Africa, where it was mostly destined for local markets in the region, and 38 per cent was intercepted in Asia. In Africa, those seizures were mostly of tramadol in West and North Africa; 161 Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019. 162 INCB database on the amounts available for consumption of opioids. 163 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment.Fig. 37 Global quantities of pharmaceutical opioids seized, 2013-2017 Source: UNODC, responses to the 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Kilogram equivalents Tramadol Codeine Fentanyl Others54 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2019DEPRESSANTSthese Most tramadol seized worldwide over the period 2013- 2017 seems to have originated in India. In 2017, only India was reported to have been a country of origin of internationally trafficked tramadol. Global seizures of tramadol increased from less than 10 kg in 2010 to almost 9 tons in 2013; they reached a record high of 125 tons in 2017. The largest quantities of tramadol seized over the period 2013- 2017 were reported by Nigeria, followed by Benin, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. In 2017, Nigeria intercepted the largest quantity worldwide (96 tons), followed by Egypt (12 tons in weight equivalents) and the United Arab Emirates (9 tons in weight equivalents). Based on recent seizure data, the main destinations of illegal tramadol shipments are countries in West and Central Africa (including Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, the Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone and the Sudan) and Northern Africa (mostly Egypt and, to a lesser extent, Libya), from which some tramadol is further smuggled to countries in the Near and Middle East (including Jordan and Leba - non). In addition, significant shipments in terms of quantity have been intercepted, originating in India and destined for countries in the Near and Middle East, such as the United Arab Emirates, both for use in the region and onward trafficking. The fact that tramadol has been intercepted in areas close to where Islamic State and some of its associated Tramadol trafficking to and within West Africa: early findings from an ongoing study Based on data from investigations and interviews with both officials and key informants in West Africa, it seems that most tramadol available for the non-medical market in West Africa has been imported from India, by boat or plane. A number of different methods of concealment have been used, including: false declarations claiming legit- imate transport of items and falsification of legal documentation such as import licences; fraudulent packaging (for example, illicitly manufactured tramadol tablets have been discovered in boxes bearing the United Nations symbol); concealment of illicitly sourced tramadol among legally imported pharmaceutical drugs, medical equipment and other goods. Criminal networks also exploit some West African countries' structural vulnerabilities, such as limited knowledge of pharmaceutical drugs among law enforcement agencies and corruption. Criminal groups from West Africa that are based in Asia and Asian criminal groups play a role in the trafficking of tramadol to West Africa. West African importers usually develop their supply chain by making contact with an exporter or an intermediary located in Asia, or directly with a manufacturer or a pharmaceutical trading company.a Importers often rely on their local contacts in the country of production for picking, buying and delivering the drugs. Importers of illicitly sourced tramadol may work in tandem with importers of licitly supplied pharmaceuti- cal products who provide their expertise, blurring the frontier between the legal and the illegal markets. There is no evidence of clandestine laboratories manufacturing tramadol in West Africa, but a number of interviewees shared their concern about the likelihood of tramadol manufacture emerging in the subregion. The smuggling of tramadol across West Africa appears to involve a range of actors. On the one hand, \"big men\" with the capacity to buy significant quantities of the drug control overall aspects of trafficking on a certain route; on the other hand, there are individuals who buy small quantities from retailers in, for example, street markets, organize transport from one country to another by taxi, motorcycle or bus, and resell the merchandise to users or to small-scale dealers.

The seizure consisted of 37 million tablets, which had originated in India and been sold to an importer based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The importer sent the tablets to Sri Lanka before shipping them by sea to Italy en route to the cities of Misrata and Tobruk in Libya, possibly destined for Islamic State groups operating in that country.173 Greece reported the seizure of 26 million tramadol tablets in two seizure cases in 2016; the tablets had originated in India, with Libya as the final destination. Those seizures are modest in comparison with the quantities of tramadol intercepted by some countries in North Africa and the Middle East. For example, Egypt reported the seizure of 252 million tramadol tablets in 2016 and 236 million in 2017, while the United Arab Emirates seized 175 million in 2017. In addition, for the first time, Morocco reported the seizure of 40 million units of tramadol in 2017, which had been shipped into the country from India by sea in containers; they were destined for Guinea and other countries in West Africa. Most of the tramadol seizures reported by Libya since 2013 have been made along the country's 173 Guardia di Finanza, reported in UNODC, Drugs Monitoring Platform; Santacroce and others, \"The new drugs and the sea\", pp. 67-68. groups have been active (including in parts of Libya, Nigeria and the Syrian Arab Republic, as well as in the Sahel) has given rise to additional concerns that tramadol trafficking may be used by those groups to finance terrorist activities and that it may also be used non-medically by their fighters to suppress pain caused by injury, to increase endurance and their potential for violence while altering their senses.170, 171, 172 Shipments to those groups have allegedly been sent from South Asia to countries in West Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, sometimes via Europe. The largest tramadol seizures in Europe in recent years concerned tramadol shipments to final destinations in North Africa. Malta reported 36 million tramadol tablets seized in three seizure cases in 2016, all originating in India and destined for Libya, as well as a further 117 million tablets seized in four seizure cases in 2017.

New synthetic opioid receptor agonists not under international control are dominated by newly emerg - ing fentanyl analogues. Their number has risen markedly in recent data provided by Member States. Out of 78 NPS identified at the global level for the first time in 2017, forensic laboratories reported 22 new synthetic opioids receptor agonists, of which 19 were fentanyl analogues.177 In the European Union in 2016, only 2 per cent of the total number of seizures of new substances reported to the European early warning system were new opioids; however, around 70 per cent of those 2 per cent (1,600 seizure cases of new opioids) were fentanyl analogues.178 177 UNODC, early warning advisory on new psychoactive substances (January 2019). 178 EMCDDA, Fentanyls and Synthetic Cannabinoids: Driving Greater Complexity into the Drug Situation-An Update from the EU Early Warning System (Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union, 2018).Mediterranean coast. A cluster of tramadol seizures occurred in the Middle East in various countries in the Gulf region, from Kuwait to Oman, most nota - bly along the coast of the United Arab Emirates. Most of the tramadol seizures in India in 2017 and 2018 were reported in the western part of the coun - try, in particular in three locations: the State of Gujarat, India, which accounts for a third of the total turnover of that country's pharmaceutical sector;174 in locations near the coast and in the city of Mumbai (suggesting substantial trafficking in tramadol by sea); and in New Delhi, in particular at its airport.175 There have also been reports of non-medical use of tramadol in North America, Europe, East and South-East Asia, and Oceania, where diversion from licit sources has been reported in a number of countries. The overall trafficking patterns of tramadol seen to date may change in the near future, however. As of April 2018, under its Narcotics and Drugs and Psy - chotropic Substances Act of 1985, India introduced more restrictive control measures for tramadol.176 Control under the Act gives more powers to law enforcement and, in particular, enables authorities to enter the premises of tramadol laboratories and prosecute those who manufacture tramadol without permission. Trafficking in fentanyl and its analogues on the increase Accounting for more than 80 per cent of all quantities of pharmaceutical opioids seized in 2017, when expressed in S-DDD, the global quantity of fentanyl and analogues seized has grown markedly in the past few years: year-on-year increases were fourfold in both 2015 and 2016 and almost sixfold in 2017. While the number of countries reporting seizures of fentanyls has increased over the past few years, the illicit market for fentanyls remains highly concentrated in North America, accounting for 99 per cent of all global quantities of fentanyls seized in 2017. 174 India, Government of Gujarat, \"Pharmaceuticals: sector profile\" (Gujarat, 2017). 175 UNODC and Paris Pact, Drugs Monitoring Platform. 176 \"T ramadol: review of the global situation\".05001,0001,5002,000 2010 2011 2012 its analogues seized, 2010-2017 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. 58 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2019DEPRESSANTSFig. 40 New psychoactive substances reported for the first time in 2017 (N = 78) Source: UNODC, early warning advisory on new psychoactive substances.

However, fentanyl remained the main substance in this group, accounting for 76 per cent of all fentanyls analysed, followed by furanylfentanyl, carfentanil and acetylfentanyl.180 Overall, 21 countries in the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania reported seizures of fentanyls over the period 2013- 2017. The number rose from just 4 countries in 2013 to 12 countries in 2016 and 16 countries in 2017, pointing at the global spread of trafficking in fentanyl-type substances. Nonetheless, based on seizures, trafficking in fen - tanyl and its analogues appears to be mainly concentrated in the Americas (mostly in North America), which accounted for 95 per cent of the total quantities of fentanyls seized worldwide over the period 2013- 2017. In the same period, seizures of fentanyls in Europe totalled 4.8 per cent; coun- tries in Oceania and Asia reported minimal seizures and Africa reported none. The largest seizures of fentanyls in 2017 (expressed in kg equivalents) were reported by the United States (2,158 kg), Canada (61 kg), Estonia (10 kg) and Sweden (4 kg). 180 Ibid.In the United States, the single largest market for fentanyl and its analogues, in 2016, 85 per cent of more than 40,000 samples of seized fentanyl-type substances were fentanyl. Making up the other 15 per cent of the total sample, 16 different fentanyl analogues were identified, including furanylfentanyl (6 per cent), acetylfentanyl (4 per cent), carfentanil (3 per cent) and 3-methylfentanyl (1 per cent).179 Another analysis, based on a smaller sample of sub - stances seized by the DEA of the United States in 179 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment.05101520253035404550 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Number Cannabinoid receptor agonist 3%DEPRESSANTSWORLD REPORT 2019 Fig. 41 Distribution by substance of fentanyl and its analogues identified in the United States, 2017 (N = 2,475) Source: United States Department of Justice, DEA, 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment, October 2018, the darknet, some also enter the United States via Canada, where powders contain- ing fentanyl substances are processed further by, for example, being pressed into tablets, mixed with heroin and sometimes sold as heroin, both for con - sumption in that country as well as for onward smuggling into the United States, in particular the north-eastern states.183 The main \"departure\" coun - try for shipments (which may be different from the country of \"origin\") of fentanyls to the United States in 2017 appears to have been Mexico, followed by China.184 Smuggling patterns can be even more complex. While the main final destination of fentanyls seized in the United States was the domestic market, some shipments were also meant for destinations abroad, notably Mexico (4 per cent) and Canada (1 per cent) in 2017. It has been speculated that some of these \"exports\" from the United States might have been intended for pressing into falsified pharmaceutical opioid tablets, such as falsified oxycodone tablets, in Mexico for subsequent \"re-imports\" into the 183 United States Department of Justice, DEA, 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment, October 2017. 184 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment.In 2017, the total quantity of fentanyl seized amounted to 2.2 tons. For comparison, global licit manufacture of fentanyl was 2.7 tons and the amount of fentanyl available for medical consump - tion was 1.4 tons.181 As it is unlikely that more than 80 per cent of the global licit manufacture of fen- tanyl in 2017 was seized and/or that more fentanyl was diverted than was available for consumption, fentanyl seizures suggest the existence of significant clandestine manufacture of the drug at the global level to supply illicit drug markets. In addition, there may be significant adulteration of the fentanyl prod - ucts on the illicit markets, resulting in large quantities of fentanyl of low purity seized (as reported by the United States). Rapidly growing market for fentanyl and its analogues in North America - supplied mainly with substances produced in East Asia According to United States authorities, the bulk of fentanyls trafficked to the United States (the prin- cipal market for the drugs) for the illegal market, seems to originate in China.182 Fentanyls are imported either by mail directly to the United States or they are trafficked into the country via Mexico, often in the form of diluted powders or falsified prescription tablets containing fentanyls.

This also seems to confirm the thesis that most fentanyl found on the United States market, in gross weight terms at least, has been trafficked overland from Mexico into the United States, which typically results in seizures of larger bulk quantities but of a far lower purity than fentanyl shipped by mail directly to the United States. It also supports the hypothesis that the bulk of the fentanyls found on the United States market is not diverted from the licit sector, which would be of almost 100 per cent purity. Most of the fentanyls seized and most of the increase in the quantities seized along the border between Mexico and the United States in 2017 were observed in T ucson and San Diego, - that is, at the western end of the border, which is an area largely controlled by the Sinaloa cartel.190 While the Sinaloa cartel controls most of the northern Pacific ports of Mexico, most of the country's southern Pacific ports, which are also key for imports of fentanyl and/or its precursors from South Asia, are controlled by the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n.191 Investiga - tions in the United States have shown that the two cartels are the primary groups involved in the traf- ficking of fentanyl into the United States via its southwestern border,192 although both cartels have also been heavily involved in the smuggling of a number of other drugs into the United States.193 According to United States authorities, shipments of fentanyls from Mexico to the United States include fentanyls manufactured in China and adul - terated in Mexico, as well as fentanyls manufactured and adulterated in Mexico. The hypothesis that there may be also significant illicit manufacture of fenta- nyls in Mexico was confirmed in 2017 when a Mexican army patrol, operating in some remote areas of the State of Sinaloa, discovered a major fentanyl manufacturing facility, which was subse- quently dismantled.194 As reported by the United States, precursor chemi- cals used in the manufacture of fentanyls in 190 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment. 191 Scott Stewart, \"Mexico's cartels find another game changer in fentanyl\", Stratfor, 3 August 2017. 192 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment. 193 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment. 194 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment.United States.185 Moreover, the discovery of clan - destine laboratories in both Canada and the United States suggests that illicit production of fentanyl (and analogues) has also been taking place in the two countries. Although the diversion of fentanyl from the phar- maceutical industry takes place, it appears to be no more than a minor contribution to the supply of fentanyl and analogues to the North American illicit market. In the United States, the largest licit pro - ducer of fentanyl worldwide,186 diversion of fentanyl mainly seems to take place on a small scale, mostly for personal use and/or street sale.187 In Canada, 391 identified cases of fentanyl diversion from licit sources were reported in 2017, but there were more than four times as many identified trafficking cases involving fentanyl (1,626 cases). The differences are even more pronounced when the quantities inter - cepted are considered. The aggregate amounts of fentanyl identified in diversion cases in Canada amounted to less than 0.1 kg in 2017 while the quantity of fentanyl seized, resulting from traffick- ing activities, amounted to 61 kg in the same year. According to United States authorities, in both 2016 and 2017, about 97 per cent of all fentanyls inter- cepted in international mail in the United States originated in China. However, imports of fentanyls by mail are estimated to represent just a fraction (12 per cent) of total illegal fentanyl imports into the United States, as the bulk of the fentanyls found on the United States market is estimated to have entered the country via land borders.188 Most people arrested for trafficking in fentanyls in the United States were citizens of the United States, and, to a lesser extent, Mexico. Fentanyl profiling in the United States189 shows that, although typically seized in small quantities, fentanyl shipped directly from China is of high purity. In almost 80 per cent of such cases of direct shipment, purity was over 50 per cent; in half of those cases, it was actually over 90 per cent. This compares with an overall average purity of fentanyl of 5.1 per cent 185 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment. 186 Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019. 187 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment. 188 Ibid. 189 Ibid.61 and courier services. Once in Europe, the new fen- tanyls are sold as \"legal\" replacements for controlled opioids on the surface web as well as on the darknet. Similar to the situation in the United States, the new fentanyls may be sold as heroin, or mixed with heroin and other controlled opioids. They may then be found in falsified medical products, although to a lesser extent than in the United States.198 Although fentanyls are often injected, their high potency and ease of use mean that nasal sprays con - taining diluted solutions have also appeared in some illicit markets in Europe in recent years. In Sweden, for example, unlabelled nasal sprays filled with acry - loylfentanyl were offered for sale online until the 198 Ibid.clandestine laboratories in North America appear to originate in China and are trafficked to the United States, partly via Mexico and Canada, while some are also smuggled from the United States into Mexico for subsequent \"re-imports\" of fentanyls into the United States. The main chemical used in the clandestine manufacture of fentanyls intercepted in the United States in recent years is 4-ANPP , sug - gesting that the less sophisticated \"Siegfried method\" is popular among operators of clandestine labora - tories in both Mexico and the United States. This method can also use NPP as the starting material for its synthesis into 4-ANPP and then into fentanyl.195 Growing market for fentanyl and its analogues in Europe A far smaller, though also growing market for fen- tanyl and its analogues is found in Europe. Fentanyl seizures and/or the non-medical use of fentanyl have been reported in most countries in Europe. Quanti - ties of fentanyl and analogues seized have shown a clear upward trend in Western and Central Europe, rising from 1 kg in 2013 to 5 kg in 2016 and 17 kg in 2017. In parallel, the European early warning system also has shown a clear increase in the number of seizures involving fentanyls in recent years, as well as in the quantities of powder and tablets seized.196 Most shipments of new fentanyls arriving in Europe reportedly originated in China.197 Reports received by UNODC from a number of countries in Europe - Estonia (2017), Poland (2017), Sweden (2016) and the United Kingdom (2017) - also seem to confirm that China is the main source of fentanyl and its analogues found on the markets in Europe. Like many other new substances, most new fentanyl analogues are not controlled under the international drug control conventions, which means that they can be manufactured in many countries and traded relatively freely. This situation has been exploited by organized crime groups in Europe that use com - panies to manufacture fentanyl analogues, which are then typically shipped to Europe by express mail 195 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment. 196 EMCDDA, Fentanyls and Synthetic Cannabinoids: Driving Greater Complexity into the Drug Situation. 197 Ibid.Recent international control of fentanyls and related precursor chemicals The international scheduling of ANPP and its direct precursor, NPP , in Table I of the United Nations Convention against Illicit T raffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 was decided by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in March 2017 and went into effect in October 2017. All parties to the 1988 Convention are requested to place those sub- stances, the two main precursors for manufac- turing fentanyl, under national control. In the past few years, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs has also approved the placing of a number of fentanyl analogues under inter- national acrylofentanyl, furanylfentanyl, butyrfentanyl (2017) and acetylfenta- nyl (2016). Following the scheduling of 116 NPS by China in October 2015, the country also placed carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, acry- loylfentanyl and valerylfentanyl under control in March a 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment.3Supply of pharmaceutical opioids62 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2019DEPRESSANTSand consumption. The only exception involved lab - oratories operating in the Russian Federation that may also have supplied fentanyl to neighbouring countries. In particular, Estonia reported for years that the Russian Federation was the main source of fentanyl found on its territory, but this appears to have changed in 2017 following the dismantling of an organized crime group and the disappearance from the market in Estonia of fentanyls trafficked from the Russian Federation within a period of sev - eral weeks. This has since been largely substituted by fentanyls trafficked by mail from China, accordi ng to reports from Estonia. Most of the significant seizures of fentanyl and its analogues in the Russian Federation over the period 2013-2017 were reported in the part of the country that is located in Europe, notably in the area around Saint Petersburg and other cities in the north of the country. The substances reported in significant sei- zures were mostly 3-methylfentanyl, fentanyl and carfentanil.202 202 UNODC and Paris Pact, Drugs Monitoring Platform. company was dismantled in 2016; nasal sprays of this type were involved in 47 deaths in Europe that year. There have also been reports of the emergence of e-liquids containing fentanyls that can be vaped using electronic cigarettes.199 Given the increasing problems related to a number of fentanyl analogues in Europe in recent years, EMCDDA and Europol conducted joint investiga- tions and cyclopropylfentanyl in 2017. They resulted in the preparation of five risk assessments in 2017 and revealed that the largest numbers of both seizure cases and substance abuse-related deaths in Europe among the five sub - stances investigated were related to carfentanil, followed by acrylofentanyl and furanylfentanyl.200 The diversion of fentanyl from licit sources prior to 2013 was reported by several countries in Europe (Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom). No such cases have been reported to UNODC since then. In addition, there have been sporadic reports of fen - tanyls produced in clandestine laboratories in Europe,201 mostly destined for local distribution 199 Ibid. 200 Ibid. 201 EMCDDA, Fentanyls and Synthetic Cannabinoids: Driving Greater Complexity into the Drug Situation.Fig. 43 Seizures of fentanyls reported to the European early warning system, 2012-2016 Source: EMCDDA, Fentanyls and Synthetic Cannabinoids: Driving Greater Complexity into the Drug Situation, p. 10.02004006008001,0001,200 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016Number of seizuresAcryloylfentanyl Furanylfentanyl4F-iBF THF-FCarfentanil 010203040506070 0 500 1,000Number of deaths Number of seizure cases Fig. 44 Number of deaths and seizure cases involving fentanyl analogues in the European Union (based on key find- ings from risk assessments of fentanyl analogues, conducted and 2017) Source: EMCDDA, Fentanyls and Synthetic Cannabinoids: Driving Greater Complexity into the Drug Situation, p. 13.63 Other central nervous system depressants 3Methaqualone is another synthetic central nervous system depressant with sedative-hypnotic, anticon - vulsant, antispasmodic and local anaesthetic properties. As with other depressants in this class, the sedative-hypnotic properties of methaqualone are mediated through its effect on the GABA receptors.204 GHB is another central nervous system depressant that produces sedation and anaesthesia; it is mainly associated with drug-facilitated sexual assault. The effects of GHB on the body are mediated through a specific GHB receptor, its activation of the GABA receptors, as well as through the dopamine system.205 GBL, a natural precursor of GHB that generates GHB in the body after ingestion, is also available in some countries as an industrial solvent for clean - ing metal and removing spray paint. GBL is sold on the illicit market as a substitute for GHB in some countries. Gabapentinoids, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are another group of central nervous system depressants that are considered to be derivatives of the neurotransmitter GABA or its analogues. Gabapentionoids have been traditionally used to treat epilepsy and generalized anxiety disorder; as non-opioid analgesics, they are also effective in treatment of neuropathic pain.206 Gabapentin and pregabalin are neither on the WHO Model List of essential medicines nor under control in the international conventions, but there are reports of their non-medical use, especially among opioid users. Non-medical use of sedatives and tranquillizers The non-medical use of sedatives and tranquillizers as a group of substances remains quite widespread and is reported in all regions. In 2017, 40 Member States ranked the non-medical use of sedatives and tranquillizers among the three most commonly used substances in their countries, while the non-medical use of benzodiazepines was ranked number one within the broader category of sedatives and 204 Ibid. 205 Ibid. 206 WHO, Expert Committee on Drug Dependence \"Pregabalin: pre-review report-agenda item 5.1\" (Geneva, November 2017).OTHER CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS Introduction After opioids, the groups of depressants that are seized in the largest quantities are sedatives and tran - quillizers. In contrast to opioids, most sedatives and tranquillizers are diverted from legal sources rather than being illegally produced. Whereas most opioids are controlled under the 1961 Convention, seda - tives and tranquillizers are controlled under the 1971 Convention. While benzodiazepines and barbitu - rates are controlled under the less strict Schedules III and IV of the 1971 Convention, methaqualone and GHB are controlled under Schedule II of the 1971 Convention. Different benzodiazepines may vary in potency and are widely used in medicine as anticonvulsants, anx - iolytics, hypnotics, sedatives, skeletal muscle relaxants and tranquillizers. Many benzodiazepines are currently under international control in the 1971 Convention. Barbiturates represent another group of synthetic central nervous system depressants that were once widely used medically as hypnotics and sedatives. Their medical use today is limited to anti-epileptics, adjuncts to anaesthesia in surgical procedures and, less commonly, as anti-anxiety drugs. Some of the common pharmaceutical barbiturates include amo - barbital, pentobarbital, phenobarbital and secobarbital. As with benzodiazepines, individual barbiturates differ in the onset and duration of their action and potency. Since barbiturates have a low therapeutic index - that is, the quantity that pro - duces a therapeutic effect and may result in toxicity - an overdose of barbiturates can prove fatal.203 As a result, they have been largely replaced on both the licit and illicit markets by benzodiazepines. Never- theless, in 2016 and 2017, some 18 countries, mainly located in Europe and Asia, ranked the non- medical use of barbiturates higher than the non-medical use of benzodiazepines on their territory. 203 T erminology and Information on Drugs, 3rd ed.

In North America, the past year non-medical use of tranquillizers in 2017 was reported to be 0.2 per cent of the population aged 15 and older in Canada213 and 2.2 per cent of the population aged 12 and older in the United States. The non-medical use of tranquillizers in the United States was reported to be at similar levels among men and women, and to be highest among young people aged 18-25.214 The non-medical use of tranquillizers is quite common in Western and Central Europe, where it ranges from 19.5 per cent among the adult popula - tion in Czechia to less than 1 per cent in Portugal. In eight of the 14 countries that reported recent estimates, non-medical use of tranquillizers was greater than the use of cannabis; in all 14 countries 213 Health Canada, \"Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CTADS): summary of results for 2017\", December 2017. 214 Results from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Detailed T ables.tranquillizers. Women seem to be particularly affected by the non-medical use of sedatives and tranquillizers, with past-year prevalence in some countries reported as being higher among women than among men, or at least at comparable levels.207 The non-medical use of benzodiazepines also figures quite prominently within polydrug use patterns, especially among opioids users.208 Opioid users typi - cally use benzodiazepines to self-medicate in order to increase or potentiate the effects of opioids, as well as to deal with the negative effects of opioid use, such as negative emotional states, dealing with anxiety or depression and even dealing with opioid withdrawal.209 Individuals in long-term opioid ago - nist treatment are particularly prone to using benzodiazepines in order to increase the effects of opioid medication and to achieve a more potent \"euphoric effect\".210 Benzodiazepines are also com - monly reported among overdose deaths attributed to the use of opioids.211, 212 Extent of non-medical use of sedatives and tranquilizers Among the countries that have reported recent survey data on the non-medical use of sedatives and tranquillizers in South and Central America, the annual prevalence of non-medical use of tranquil- lizers in most of them is more than 2 per cent of the general population and the non-medical use of tran- quillizers is higher among women than among men. The non-medical use of tranquillizers is also quite commonly reported in school surveys in those sub - regions. For example, El Salvador reported an annual prevalence of the non-medical use of tranquillizers 207 See, for example, World Drug Report 2018: Women and Drugs-Drug Use, Drug Supply and Their Consequences (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.18.XI.9 (Booklet 5)). 208 Jermaine D.

Recent school surveys among secondary school students measured the past- year prevalence of the non-medical use of tranquillizers - mainly benzodiazepines. Among stu - dents aged 15-19 in Egypt, the prevalence was 1.7 per cent in 2016;217 among students aged 15-17 in Morocco, the prevalence was 2.3 per cent in 2017.218 In Asia, where survey data are also limited, the annual prevalence of the non-medical use of tran- quillizers reported in the most recent drug use survey in Pakistan, conducted in 2013, was 1.5 per cent among women and 1.3 per cent among men.219 In India in 2018, around 1 per cent of people aged 10-75 were current users of sedatives and tranquil - lizers for non-medical reasons.The non-medical use of sedatives and tranquillizers was also reported in South-East Asia, including in Brunei Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Malaysia; the Phil- ippines; Singapore; and Taiwan Province of China. Prevalence estimates are not available, however. 217 MedSPAD 2016 in Egypt. 218 Jallal Toufiq, National Centre for Drug Abuse Prevention and Research of Morocco, presentation on \"Drug use among Moroccan youth: MedSPAD surveys\", Lisbon, October 2017. 219 UNODC and Pakistan, Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control, Drug Use in Pakistan 2013.the non-medical use of tranquilizers was higher among women than men. The non-medical use of tranquillizers and sedatives was also quite common among students aged 15 and 16 in Europe. In 2015, lifetime prevalence was reported to be 6 per cent, the highest rates being reported in Poland (17 per cent) and Czechia (16 per cent) and the lowest in Demark and Romania (between 1 and 2 per cent). Students who had used alcohol also reported the use of other substances, including cigarettes (54 per cent), cannabis (19 per cent), inhalants (9 per cent), tranquillizers or sedatives (7 per cent) and NPS or other controlled drugs (5 per cent or less). Since 2016, falsified Rivotril\u00ae, a benzodiazepine contain- ing clonazepam and classified as a narcotic substance in Finland, has been reported as having been traf- ficked from Central Europe to Finland, among other Nordic countries.215 The non-medical use of sedatives and tranquillizers was also reported in Africa, although survey data are limited in the region. In the 2018 drug use survey in Nigeria, the past-year prevalence of the non-med - ical use of tranquillizers was estimated at roughly 0.5 per cent of the adult population: 0.4 per cent among women and 0.5 per cent among men.216 The non-medical use of tranquillizers was also prevalent in North Africa: for example, in Algeria in 2010, 215 EMCDDA, \"Finland country report 2018\". 216 UNODC, Drug Use in Nigeria 2018.Fig. 46 Non-medical use of tranquillizers among the adult population aged 15-64 in Western and Central Europe Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.0510152025 Austria (2015) Cyprus (2016) Czechia (2015) Germany (2012) Hungary (2015) Ireland (2015) Italy (2013) Latvia (2011) Lithuania (2016) Netherlands (2016) Norway (2015) Poland (2016) Portugal (2017) Spain (2015) Sweden (2013)Annual prevalence (percentage)Overall Men Women67 Non-medical use of sedatives and tranquillizers 3available via the internet or sold on the illicit market.226 As the pharmacology and toxicology of NPS benzodiazepines is largely unknown, they may pose a high risk to users and in some cases have resulted in acute emergencies and deaths. NPS benzodiazepines and thienodiazepines were implicated in nine drug-related deaths in England and Wales in the period 2013-2014, as either the cause of death or having contributed to death.227 Methaqualone Methaqualone is a potent quinazoline within the class of sedatives, which has hypnotic, anticonvul- sant, antispasmodic and local anaesthetic properties. Formerly sold under the brand names Quaalude\u00ae and Mandrax\u00ae, methaqualone became popular as a club drug in the late 1960s and 1970s, but its use had waned in Western countries by the mid-1980s. Withdrawn from the pharmaceutical market around the same time in many countries as a result of prob - lems of abuse, methaqualone is controlled under Schedule II of the 1971 Convention.228 One of the few countries that currently reports the non-medical use of methaqualone is South Africa, where the mixed use of cannabis and methaqualone (also known as \"smoking white pipe\") is reported in some regions as being the primary or secondary substance of use among people in treatment for drug use dis- orders and is seen as serious public health problem.229, 230 gamma-Hydroxybutyrate GHB, another depressant, is used medically as an adjunct in anaesthesia and is also used to treat insomnia and clinical depression. The non-medical use of GHB is not common, with only a few coun- tries worldwide reporting such use among the general population. The past-year prevalence of GHB ranges from 0.1 per cent reported in Israel 226 Ibid. 227 Manchester and others, \"The emergence of new psychoactive substances (NPS) benzodiazepines\". 228 T erminology and Information on Drugs. 229 Siphokazi Dada and others, Monitoring Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Use Trends in South Africa: Phase 43 (Cape Town, South Africa, South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use, October 2018). 230 Greg McCarthy, Bronwyn Myers and Nandi Siegfried, \"T reatment for methaqualone dependence adults\", of Review (April 2005).NPS benzodiazepines The number of reported NPS with a sedative-hyp- notic effect remains low: they numbered 25 among the 492 NPS reported in 2017. Of the 79 NPS reported for the first time to the UNODC early warning advisory in 2017, only four were NPS with a sedative-hypnotic effect. Most such NPS are ben - zodiazepines, some of which have been patented, but many have never been marketed for medical use.

Yet, in 2016, GHB ranked fourth in the top 20 drugs recorded in emergency presentations in 19 sentinel hospitals in 13 European Union member countries.231 GHB acts on the central nervous system in a bipha - sic time profile, i.e. induces an initial stimulant-like effect with a disinhibiting action and a subsequent sedative effect. This makes GHB one of the most used substances in drug-facilitated sexual assaults and in settings in which men have sex with men, with an associated risk of sexually transmitted infec - tions, including HIV.232 The use of GHB, GBL and benzodiazepines such as flunitrazepam has been associated with drug-facil - itated sexual assault, which occurs when alcohol or drugs are used to compromise an individual's ability to consent to sexual activity. It has been reported across the regions.233, 234, 235 The use of GHB and 231 EMCCDA, European Drug Report 2018. 232 Giorgetti and others, \"When 'Chems' meet sex\". 233 United States, Department of Justice, Department Enforcement Administration, Community Outreach and Prevention Support Section, Victim Witness Assistance Program, \"Drug-facilitated sexual assault\" (April 2017).Fig. 47 GHB use among the general population in selected countries Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

In Saudi Arabia, 7 per cent of people in drug treat- ment were reportedly in treatment for disorders related to the non-medical use of pregabalin. In a 2015 study in the United Arab Emirates, more than 80 per cent of people in treatment were polydrug users, of whom the majority had used four or more substances either sequentially or concomitantly.257 While tramadol and heroin remained the main opi - oids used among this group, more than 60 per cent reported concurrent use of pregabalin.258 In Gaza, Palestine, in 2016, nearly all high-risk male drug users reported current use of tramadol, and more than half also reported the concurrent use of pregabalin.259 The concomitant use of gabapentin with opioids 253 EudraVigilance, the database of European Medicines Agency. 254 Chiappini and Fabrizio Schifano, \"A decade of Medicine Agency's 'Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions' database\", CNS Drugs, vol. 7 (July 2016), pp. 647-654. 255 Vikas Kapil gabapentin in the UK\", British Journal of Clinical Pharmacol- ogy, vol. 78, No. 1 (July 2014), pp. 190-191. 256 Ibid. 257 Hiba Alblooshi and others, \"The pattern of substance use disorder in the United Arab Emirates in 2015: results of a National Rehabilitation Centre cohort study\", Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy (May 2016), pp. 11-19. 258 See also Amneh Al-Husseini, Mayyada Wazaify and Claire Van Hout, \"Pregabalin misuse and abuse in Jordan: a qualitative study of user experiences\", International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, vol. 16, No. 3 (June 2018) pp. 642-654. 259 Ministry of Health of the State of Palestine and Palestinian National Institute of Public Health, Estimating the Extent of Illicit Drug Use in Palestine (Ramallah, 2017).identified by a number of studies.

Methaqualone The geographical scope of trafficking in methaqualone appears to be quite limited at present, except for ongoing trafficking flows from India to East and Southern Africa. Almost the entire quantity of methaqualone (99 per cent) seized over the period 2013-2017 was intercepted in just three countries: 75 per cent of it in India and the remainder in Mozambique and South Africa. This reflects the fact that the majority of the illicit manufacture of meth - aqualone worldwide takes place in India and its main illicit markets are located in Southern Africa. The lack of data on the use of methaqualone for non- medical purposes, however, makes it difficult to assess the overall extent of the market for the drug. Data indicate that a limited amount of very large shipments of methaqualone - that is, seizures weighing several kg to several tons \u2014 are intercepted in India, which are mainly destined for export. In addition, a large number of small seizures, destined for trafficking and distribution on the local market, are made in South Africa. The average methaqualone seizure in South Africa was 0.14 kg in both 2016 has been associated with a substantial increase in the risk of opioid overdose, probably reflecting both additive respiratory depression and increased gabapentin concentrations when used with opioids.260 In 13 countries in the European Union, pregabalin is listed among the top 20 drugs reported in 2016 among drug-related toxicity presentations in 19 sentinel hospitals, although not in the same numbers or proportions as drugs such a heroin, cocaine, cannabis and GHB.261 Supply of sedatives and tranquillizers In terms of quantity, methaqualone has been the substance most seized among sedatives and tranquillizers over the past two decades, other than during the period 2010- 2015 when benzodiazepines were dominant. Overall, 133 countries reported seizures of sedatives and tranquillizers to UNODC over the period 1998- 2017, including 91 countries over the period 2013-2017. The largest quantities of sedatives and tranquillizers seized in the period 2013-2017 were reported by countries in Asia (47 260 Tara Gomes and others, \"Gabapentin, opioids, and the risk death: a population-based nested case- control study\", PLoS Medicine, vol. 14, No. 10 (October 2017). 261 EMCCDA, European Drug Report 2018.Fig. 48 Emergency presentations in sentinel hospitals, by top 10 drugs recorded in Europe, 2016 Source: EMCDDA, European Drug Report, opioids Other medicinesNumber71 Supply of sedatives and tranquillizers 3that year, the third-largest annual quantity ever reported. Annual methaqualone seizures in 2017 fell back to 4.5 tons, although that was still above the average over the period 2007-2016 (3.4 tons). The licit manufacture of only very limited amounts and 2017, while in India it was 3 tons in 2016 and 5 kg in 2017. This may be an indication of a supply chain originating in India, from where methaqualone is exported at wholesale level to South Africa, where it is distributed on the retail market, although little is known about detailed trafficking patterns and routes. Seizures of methaqualone have also been reported by other countries in Southern Africa (Namibia) and in East Africa (Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania) in the past decade. However, given the limited capacity of some countries in Africa to undertake and report seizures, it is also possible that some trafficking goes undetected in that region. A few other countries also reported seizures of methaqualone over the period 2013- 2017, including countries in the Americas (notably the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Argentina), Europe (Spain, Italy and Belgium) and Oceania (Australia). While methaqualone used to have a global reach - 70 countries reported seizures over the period 1982-2017 across all regions - only 11 countries reported seizures of the drug in the past five years. The presence of methaqualone in international drug markets and in drug shipments intercepted appears to have declined since its widespread use as a recre- ational drug in the club scene in North America and Europe in the late 1960s and 1970s. The decline in the 1990s followed the rescheduling of methaqua- lone from a Schedule IV to a Schedule II substance in 1979, given reports of its limited medical useful - ness and of abuse potential.262, 263 The declining use was prompted by subsequent recommendations in 1989 to have its production and its international trade stopped.264 However, there has been a recent surge in the quantities of methaqualone seized, owing primarily to large quantities intercepted in India in 2016 (24 tons). This resulted in a global total of 28 tons seized 262 WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence: Twenty-fifth Report, WHO Technical Report Series, No. 775 (Geneva, World Health Organization, 1989). 263 Psychotropic Substances: Statistics for 2016-Assessments of Annual Medical and Scientific Requirements for Substances in Schedules II, III and IV of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 (E/INCB/2017/3), para. 27. 264 WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence: Twenty-fifth Report.Fig. 49 Global quantities of sedatives and tranquillisers seized, 1998-2017 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

The licit manufacture of benzodiazepines was reported by 21 countries in 2016;269 Italy, India, China and Brazil, in descending order of amounts manufactured, together accounted for more than 85 per cent of the total global manufacture of benzodiazepines in 2017.270 The largest licit manufacture of benzodiazepines in 2017 was of diazepam (47 tons), followed by chlor - diazepoxide (19 tons) and oxazepam (14 tons). Expressed in S-DDD, the largest production was of alprazolam (9.5 billion S-DDD in 2017), followed by diazepam (4.8 billion S-DDD) and lorazepam (3.7 billion S-DDD).271, 272 Those three substances are the most consumed benzodiazepines in the con - text of medical use,273 and alprazolam and diazepam are the benzodiazepines most frequently found on illicit markets. In 2017, the most traded benzodi - azepines worldwide, in terms of number of countries reporting their licit import, were diazepam, clonazepam, alprazolam and lorazepam 2017.274 of and trade in benzodi - azepines decreased significantly in 2017. Manufacture of bromazepam and midazolam, for example, decreased by more than 70 and 25 per cent, respectively, from the previous year. Global stocks of diazepam and alprazolam decreased by 50 per cent each, while stocks of midazolam and clon- azepam decreased by 18 and 30 per cent, respectively. As a result, the volume of imports and exports also decreased, with imports of diazepam decreasing by more than 40 per cent and midazolam by 50 per cent in 2017.275 In parallel to the reduction in the licit manufacture and trade in benzodiazepines, seizures of benzodi- azepines also declined by more than 90 per cent from the previous year, following marked 268 E/INCB/2018/3. 269 E/INCB/2017/3. 270 Ibid.of methaqualone has been reported in recent years:265 10 g in the United States, and 2 g in Japan in 2017; 20 g in Switzerland in 2016; and 30 g in Canada in 2014.266 As a result, it can be assumed that, in contrast to most other sedatives and tran - quillizers, practically all of the methaqualone trafficked and seized in recent years has been illicitly manufactured. While India appears to have been the main source of methaqualone destined for international illicit markets, a number of clandestine methaqualone laboratories have been dismantled in recent years in South Africa (eight in 2013 and eight in 2016). Authorities in Mozambique also reported the dis - mantling of a clandestine methaqualone laboratory in 2017.267 This is a contrast to the period 2006- 2009, when South Africa regularly reported that most of the methaqualone found on its market origi- nated in China and, to a lesser extent, in India. No mentions of China, either by South Africa or any other country, were reported in subsequent years. Pertaining to 2015, the latest detailed report received from India confirmed that most of the methaqua- lone seized in that country continued to be destined for markets in East and Southern Africa. The United Republic of Tanzania accounted for 35 per cent of the total, and Zambia for another 8 per cent of all known destination countries. Almost a third of it was reported as destined for markets in South-East Asia (Malaysia, 30 per cent). Benzodiazepines The use of benzodiazepines for non-medical pur - poses as well as trafficking in benzodiazepines appear to be far more widespread than for methaqualone at the global level, even though the overall reported quantity seized was smaller than that of methaqualone in both 2016 and 2017. A total of 36 benzodiazepines were under international control in 2018, of which 28 had a 265 Psychotropic Substances: Statistics for 2017-Assessments of Annual Medical and Scientific Requirements for Substances in Schedules II, III and IV of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 (E/INCB/2018/3), para. 177. 266 E/INCB/2017/3. 267 Country report submitted by Mozambique to the T wenty-eighth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Africa (UNODC/HONLAF/28/ CRP .7). 73 Supply of sedatives and tranquillizers 3persons and as a drug facilitating sexual assault. It was transferred from Schedule IV to Schedule III of the 1971 Convention in 1995,278 and remains the only benzodiazepine found in this schedule. In parallel, owing to its potential for abuse, several countries, including major manufacturers and importers of the substance, adopted strict control policies for it, in close cooperation with the phar - maceutical industry.279 Licit manufacture and diversions of the substance have declined markedly of late: global licit manu - facture of flunitrazepam amounted to 590 kg in 2016 and 205 kg in 2017, down from nearly 2 tons in 2015.280 Meanwhile, global flunitrazepam seizures fell from some 60 g in 2013 to just 0.2 g in 2017. Seizures of flunitrazepam were reported only by Canada, Taiwan Province of China and Kenya. France was the only country to report diversions of the substance over the period 2013-2017, suggest- ing that only small amounts of this benzodiazepine still enter global clandestine drug markets. 278 WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence: Twenty-ninth Report, WHO Technical Report Series, No. 856 (Geneva, World Health Organization, 1995). 279 E/INCB/2018/3 and previous years. 280 E/INCB/2017/3.fluctuations over the years. The regions where most quantities seized were reported have also shifted over time. In 2010 and 2015, most seizures (measured in kg equivalents) were reported in Asia; in 2016, most quantities seized were reported in Africa; and in 2011, 2013 and 2017, in the Americas. Record highs in quantities of specific benzodiaz - epines seized have been reported in recent years, including 4.8 tons of alprazolam (e.g. Xanax\u00ae) in 2014 and 6.3 tons of diazepam (e.g. Valium\u00ae) in 2016. For comparison, in 2016 the global licit man - ufacture of alprazolam and diazepam totalled 12.1 tons and 46.5 tons, respectively.276 Overall, the licit manufacture of benzodiazepines (some 150 tons in 2017)277 is substantially greater than global seizures of benzodiazepines (8 tons in 2016 and 0.7 tons in 2017). Since 2010, diazepam has been seized in larger quantities than any other benzodiazepine, although large quantities of alprazolam have also been intercepted in recent years. One of the key benzodiazepines on illicit drug mar - kets in the 1980s and the 1990s, flunitrazepam (e.g. Rohypnol\u00ae) is often used by heroin-dependent 276 E/INCB/2017/3. 277 E/INCB/2018/3.Fig. 51 Global quantities of benzodiazepines seized, 2010-2017 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. a Excluding benzodiazepines of a type was not identified.

Although most seizures of benzodiazepines result from the diversion from licit manufacture, a small number of clandestine laboratories illicitly manu - facturing benzodiazepines have been detected in recent years. In 2011 and 2015, Malaysia reported the dismantling of clandestine laboratories manu - facturing nimetazepam. Canada, India and Sweden reported the dismantling of a total of six clandestine laboratories involved in the manufacture of alpra - zolam in the period 2013- 2017. Sweden also reported the dismantling of a laboratory manufac- turing flunitrazolam (a NPS benzodizepine) in 2017. benzodiazepines seized over the period 2013- 2017 consisted of diazepam (in Africa), alprazolam (in the Americas and Asia) and clonaz- epam, followed by diazepam (in Europe). In total, five countries accounted for 92 per cent of the global quantity of benzodiazepines seized over that period: Nigeria and the United States, followed by Thailand, India and Canada. In contrast to most other drugs, no clear trafficking patterns emerge from seizures of benzodiazepines.

Over the period 2013- 2017, countries in the Americas accounted for more than two thirds of the total global quantity of GHB seized, followed by countries in Oceania (19 per cent) and Europe (13 per cent), while sei- zures in Asia were comparatively small (0.1 per cent). No GHB seizures were reported in Africa. A total of 32 countries reported seizures of GHB over the period 2013-2017, with the largest quan- tities seized reported in the Americas: the United States (also the leading licit manufacturer of GHB worldwide in 2016 and previous years), followed by Canada and Argentina. In Oceania, the largest quan - tity of GHB was intercepted in Australia, followed by New Zealand.

The non-medical use of GHB was reported mainly in the United States of America, Europe and Australia. 285 The licit manufacture of GHB, which is used in the pharmaceutical industry and in the production of a variety of industrial polymers, has been increasing for some time, in particular since 2012, and reached a record high of 72 tons in 2016 (68 tons in 2017).

According to INCB, China continued to be the leading licit manufacturer of barbiturates, accounting for 49 per cent of total manufacture of the entire group of barbiturates in 2017, followed by India (24 per cent) and the United States (10 per cent).290 290 E/INCB/2018/3, p. 43. Barbiturates Overall, 12 different barbiturates are under inter - national control, under schedules II, III and IV of the 1971 Convention.288 Quantities of barbiturates seized, although fluctuat- ing, have been substantially smaller than those of benzodiazepines, which reflects the fact that far more benzodiazepines than barbiturates are manufactured and traded at the global level. While an annual aver - age of 3.4 tons of benzodiazepines were seized over the period 2013-2017, seizures of barbiturates amounted to less than 600 kg per year. Over the period 2013-2017, most data on barbi - turates seized do not specify the substance involved, except in the case of phenobarbital. In the period 2010-2012, phenobarbital, barbital, pentobarbital, pentobarbitone and secobarbital were also explicitly mentioned among the substances seized. This seems to be in line with the licit manufacture of barbitu- rates: in 2017, phenobarbital accounted for 73 per cent of global manufacture of all barbiturates, fol- lowed by barbital (11 per cent) and pentobarbital (8 per cent).289 Global licit manufacture of the seven barbiturates most commonly seen on international markets amounted to 356 tons in 2017. Of the barbiturates seized over the period 2013- 2017, 47 per cent of the total quantity was reported in the Americas (mostly the United States, followed by Canada and Argentina), 22 per cent in Oceania (mostly Australia), 16 per cent in Europe (mostly Portugal and the Russian Federation), 15 per cent in Asia (mostly India, followed by Indonesia, Tajik- istan, Myanmar and Japan) and 1 per cent in Africa (mostly Zambia, followed by Senegal). 288 E/INCB/2017/3, para. 141. 289 E/INCB/2018/3, by region, 2010-2017 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. - 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Kilogram equivalents Americas Oceania Europe Asia Africa77ANNEX Table 3 Annual prevalence of the use of opioids, by region and globally, 2017 Source: UNODC estimates based on annual report questionnaire data and other official sources.Number of users annually (best estimate)Estimated number of users annually (lower)Estimated number of users annually (upper)Per cent of population aged 1564 years (best estimate)Per cent of population aged 1564 years (lower)Per cent of population aged 1564 years (upper) Africa 6,080,000 5,000,000 7,390,000 0.87 0.71 1.06 Eastern Africa - - - - - - Northern Africa 360,000 120,000 660,000 - 0.25 0.08 0.46- Southern and South-Eastern Africa - - - - - - West and Central Africa - - - - - - Americas 13,600,000 11,980,000 16,320,000 2.03 1.79 2.43 Caribbean - - - - - - Central America (excluding Mexico) - - - - - - Northern America (including Mexico) 12,830,000 11,640,000 13,720,000 3.96 4,910,000 8,550,000 2.28 1.61 2.81 Southern - 3,570,000 3,330,000 3,830,000 0.66 0.61 0.52 0.63 Oceania 650,000 570,000 730,000 2.48 2.18 2.79 Australia and New Zealand 630,000 570,000 680,000 3.28 2.98 3.58 Melanesia - - - - - - Micronesia - - - - - - Polynesia - - - - - - Global 53,350,000 47,160,000 60,180,000 1.08 0.96 1.2278 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2019DEPRESSANTS Table 4 Annual prevalence of the use of opiates, by region and globally, 2017 Source: UNODC estimates based on annual report questionnaire data and other official sources.Number of users annually (best estimate)Estimated number of users annually (lower)Estimated number of users annually (upper)Per cent of population aged 1564 years (best estimate)Per cent of population aged 1564 years (lower)Per cent of population aged 1564 years (upper) Africa 1,470,000 530,000 2,800,000 0.21 0.08 0.40 Eastern Africa - - - - - - Northern Africa 360,000 120,000 660,000 - 0.25 0.08 0.46- Southern and South-Eastern Africa - - - - - - West and Central Africa - - - - - - Americas 2,690,000 1,970,000 3,480,000 0.40 0.29 0.52 Caribbean - - - - - - Central America (excluding Mexico) - - - - - - Northern America (including Mexico) 2,400,000 1,790,000 2,970,000 0.74 0.55 0.92 South Asia 21,730,000 18,970,000 24,570,000 East/South-West 4,930,000 3,300,000 6,910,000 1.62 1.08 2.27 Southern Asia - - - Europe 3,220,000 3,010,000 3,600,000 0.59 0.55 1,490,000 1,410,000 0.63 0.70 and Central Europe 1,740,000 1,590,000 2,030,000 0.54 0.50 0.64 Oceania 40,000 40,000 70,000 0.16 0.14 0.28 Australia and New Zealand 35,000 35,000 41,000 0.18 0.18 0.22 Melanesia - - - - - - Micronesia - - - - - - Polynesia - - - - - - Global 29,160,000 24,510,000 34,520,000 0.59 0.50 0.7079 Annex32007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 SOUTH-WEST ASIA Afghanistan (best 163,000 182,000 301,000 242,000 221,000 355,000 ASIA Lao 710 1,100 1,900 2,500 3,100 1,900 3,500 3,900 upper bound a 1,860 2,700 2,700 4,000 6,000 11,500 5,800 9,000 7,600 Myanmar (best estimate)715 394 356 341 338 313 298 387 595 462 282 ..

Afghanistan and Myanmar are the only countries for which the proportion of potential opium production not converted into heroin within the country is estimated. For all other countries, for the purposes of this table, it is assumed that all opium produced is converted into heroin. The amount of heroin produced from Afghan opium is calculated using two parameters that may change: (a) the amounts of opium consumed as raw opium in the region; and (b) the conversion ratio into heroin. The first parameter's estimate is based on consumption data in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries. For the second parameter, from 2005 to 2013, a conversion ratio of opium to morphine/heroin of 7:1 was used, based on interviews conducted with Afghan morphine/heroin \"cooks\", on an actual heroin production exercise conducted by two (illiterate) Afghan heroin \"cooks\", documented by the German Bundeskriminalamt in Afghanistan in 2003 (published in Bulletin on Narcotics, vol. LVII, Nos. 1 and 2, 2005, pp. 11-31), and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) studies on the morphine content of Afghan opium (12.3 per cent over the period 2010-2012, down from 15 per cent over the period 2000-2003). Starting from 2014, a different approach to the conversion was adopted, reflecting updated information on morphine content and a different method for taking purity into account. The revised approach uses a ratio of 18.5 kg of opium for 1 kg of 100 per cent pure heroin base (see Afghanistan Opium Survey 2014, UNODC, November 2014). This translates into a ratio of 9.2-12.9 kg (range: 9-14 kg) of opium for 1 kg of export-quality heroin of 50 - 70 per cent purity. For more details, see \"Afghanistan Opium Survey 2017 - Challenges to sustainable development, peace and security\" (UNODC, May 2018). The amount of heroin produced in Myanmar in 2018 was calculated by subtracting the estimated unprocessed opium for consumption from the total opium production and using a conversion factor of 10:1. The unprocessed opium in Myanmar was estimated to be 125 tons in 2018, based on the total unprocessed opium in East Asia (TOCTA EAP report, 2013) and considering the relative cultivation levels of Lao PDR and Myanmar. For further information, please refer to the Methodology chapter (section 4.3) of the Myanmar Opium Survey 2018 (UNODC, January 2019). For countries other than Afghanistan, a \"traditional\" conversion ratio of opium to heroin of 10:1 is used. The ratios will be adjusted when improved information becomes available. Figures in italics are preliminary and may be revised when updated information becomes available. 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Total potential manufacture 686 600 427 383 467 377 555 542 327 388 692-1042 487-737 89GLOSSARY amphetamine-type stimulants \u2014 a group of substances composed of synthetic stimulants controlled under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 and from the group of substances called ampheta - mines, which includes amphetamine, methamphetamine, methcathinone and substances (3,4-methylenedioxym- ethamphetamine amphetamines \u2014 group of amphetamine-type stimulants that includes amphetamine and methamphetamine. annual prevalence \u2014 the total number of people of a given age range who have used a given drug at least once in the past year, divided by the number of people of the given age range, and expressed as a percentage. coca paste (or coca base) \u2014 an extract of the leaves of the coca bush.

Booklet 1 provides a summary of the four subsequent booklets by reviewing their key findings and highlighting policy implications based on their conclusions. Booklet 2 contains a global overview of the latest estimates of and trends in the supply, use and health consequences of drugs. Booklet 3 looks at recent trends in the market for depressants (including opioids, sedatives, tranquillizers and hypnotics), while Booklet 4 deals with recent trends in the market for stimulants (including cocaine, amphetamine-type stimulants and new psychoactive substances). Booklet 5 contains a review of recent trends in the market for cannabis and for hallucinogens. The section on cannabis also includes a review of the latest developments in the jurisdictions that have adopted measures allowing the non-medical use of cannabis.
