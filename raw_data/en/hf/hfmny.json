LEAVES OF ABSENCE July 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 - Sabbatical 8. TEACHING (a) Areas of Special Interest and Accomplishments I was a Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research Scholar and a Canadian Institutes for Health Research New Investigator during the first five years of my academic appointment at UBC. The intention of these peer -reviewed, competitive sa lary awards is to facilitate and promote my research career. As such, both awards stipulated limitations to the amount of time that can be committed to teaching so that I could focus on developing my research program. Page 3/56 Despite these restrictions on my teach ing, I continued to teach as much as these awards permit. In doing so, I developed two new courses in the faculty, and continue to teach at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. Relevant Education and Teaching Approach Over the course of my post -graduate career, I have been involved in numerous courses related to instructional and lecture skills and techniques. As a clinical faculty member in Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and mentor for PharmD students and hospital pharmacy residents, I have pa rticipated in a number of workshops designed for the development of preceptors directly involved in the mentorship of these students. During my post -graduate and post - doctoral training, I was also involved in seminars and symposia on instructional methods aimed at enhancing instructional skills and was mentored by two excellent teachers, Dr. Aslam Anis and Dr. Bernie O'Brien. My exposure to these mentors has helped me to develop my own personal approach to teaching and higher education that involves develop ing a connection with the students, identifying their needs and goals, and motivating them to strive to meet or exceed their own personal expectations. Outside of academia, I am a certified intermediate- level hockey coach, a program that involves instruction on teaching techniques, mentorship, communication skills, and conflict resolution methods. Having now coached hockey at many levels for many years, I have applied and developed many different instructional techniques (e.g. building on component s of certain skills over time) and motivational approaches that are also applicable to the university classroom or one -to-one mentorship of trainees. Context of University Teaching I have been involved in various facets of university teaching, including didactic instruction at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, one -to-one mentorship of undergraduate directed studies students, hospital pharmacy and medical residents, and Phar mD students. I have also been involved in the continuing education of pharmacy and medical professionals in workshops and conferences. In the undergraduate curriculum, I am involved in teaching courses within the Pharmaceutical Sciences curriculum in which I have taught in classes of approximately 160 students in the area of health outcomes assessment and pharmacoeconomics. I also developed, and am currently teaching a 4 th year undergraduate elective course in pharmacoeconomics which has now been offered since the winter term of 2006. At the graduate level, I lead the development of a new 6 credit course in the Doctor of Pharmacy Program (PHAR506). Since the inception of the PharmD program at UBC, PharmD students were enrolled in HCEP400 (Basic Biostatis tics) and HCEP 502 (Clinical Trials). Having taken both of the courses, I was aware that the content and objectives of these courses did not meet the learning needs of Doctor of Pharmacy Students. Therefore, in collaboration with Dr. Carlo Marra, I underto ok a review of the current courses, and an environmental scan of curricula from PharmD programs throughout North America, and developed a new 6 -credit course encompassing biostatistics, epidemiology, and health economics -PHAR506 Critical Appraisal of Phar macotherapy Literature. This course was run for two years as a directed studies course, after which we applied for, and received UBC Senate approval as an official course in the PharmD curriculum. Finally, I have led discussions in economic evaluation and quantitative benefit -risk analysis in the Department of Health Care and Epidemiology in the Faculty of Medicine (approximately 15 students). Outside of the core courses within the Faculty, the students enrolled in the course often come from health care backgrounds prior to entering pharmacy, and have specific interests in health economics, epidemiology, and outcomes research. Exposing students to these concepts has been a valuable approach to attracting directed studies and summer research program students as well. Approach to Teaching & Learning Philosophy of teaching I believe that any educational process must involve the participation of both the teacher and the student, and that the balance between a learner -centred and a teaching -centred teaching approach must be adopted, depending on the learning situation. In addition to teaching some larger classed, I have been fortunate to be involved in a lot of one -to-Page 4/56 one mentorships with hospital pharmacy residents, Pharm.D. students, and graduate students, as well as teaching in smaller classes (of 15 - 25 students) and thus, have always had the opportunity to actively engage the students in the learning process using a learning -centred approach. Thus, when mentoring one -to-one, my teaching philosophy entail s actively engaging the student in the learning progress rather than merely using didactic methods, and to involve students in active discussion and dialogue which facilitates the development and fostering of the students critical thinking skills. I also t ry to integrate this philosophy into the classroom environment as well. Beliefs Dedicated to being a life -long learner, my philosophy of teaching embraces the concept that learning is an active process that encompasses both the educator and the student. T he learning environment (whether in the classroom or in an experiential setting) that I try to create encourages students to pursue their goals and express their individual ideas through intellectual discussion. Students are encouraged to take responsibili ty for their education and to work with me to enrich their educational experiences. My goal is to work with students through interactions in and outside of class to explain the course materials, untangle the confusion, and guide students to meet their goals. My responsibility is to help my students learn - I do this by building on course materials and texts, integrating recent scientific findings into my teaching, encouraging the use of external resources, and trying to impart the skills of critical thinking in my students. As the scope of my professional and research interests has increased to include areas that are not traditionally part of the pharmacy curriculum, the challenge of presenting this material to both undergraduate and Doctor of Pharmacy s tudents has increased. However, I find that, with my clinical background, I have the ability to put the issues and concepts that I am teaching into perspective such that students with a health sciences background can easily comprehend. As a quantitative person with skills and training in this area, my overall teaching philosophy is firmly grounded within the philosophical domains of apprenticeship and development, with some components of nurturing. I find that my teaching mostly focuses on these aspects w ith little emphasis on trying to implement social reform through my teaching. This void is one area that I would like to fill as I move forward with my teaching within the university. Social reform is vital in the profession of pharmacy as the profession i s moving towards assuming more responsibility for the primary care of patients, and is particularly germane to one of my specific areas of research interest, specifically policy development for orphan drugs. Part of this process will be to educate and moti vate students to be the vehicle to implement change once they graduate. As young practitioners, many are filled with idealism and dreams that may not necessarily be feasible in practice. I feel that part of my role as an educator is to illustrate the current state of affairs with respect to the profession, establish feasible and realistic goals that students can hope to achieve within the short and long term, and to identify the challenges that the profession is faced with. Actions When lecturing to large classes in the undergraduate curriculum, I am often introducing new concepts and ideas that many students have not encountered. As such, these lectures are often teaching -centred such that a structured presentation is delivered. However, one of the goals of these lectures is to invigorate students and pique their interest in the content such that they will either further investigate on their own, enroll in elective courses in higher levels, or pursue directed studies or summer studentships. Therefore, I st rive to give practical examples (actual topical situations that exist in the Canadian and other countries' health care systems) and assign problems (i.e. evaluate an article from the lay media about \"health hype\") that help them realize the importance of t he material to the profession of pharmacy. Whether in a didactic setting or a situation of one -to-one mentorship, my general approach entails \"teaching through example\". More specifically, I use textbooks and course materials that I have developed to illus trate specific concepts, and then integrate scientific findings and specific real- world examples of where the concepts have been demonstrated. I strongly believe that students may have different objectives for taking the courses that they choose. Therefor e, when possible I engage the student to establish specific goals and objectives for their individual learning experience. Then, as a teacher, I strive to ensure that the student realizes his or her own specific goals. Specifically, for senior undergraduat e, Pharm.D, and other graduate students where I am more closely involved with the students, I adopt a discussion group approach where students are assigned one or two short pre -readings on the content area and instructed to come prepared to discuss the mat erial. Examples are given which illustrate the practical application of the content of the pre -readings and case- studies are completed during the session to help them develop critical thinking and problem -solving skills. As such, I try to keep these sessions as \"learner -centered\" as possible.
