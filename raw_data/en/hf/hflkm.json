ABSTRACT This study aimed at inve stigating effects of dan - delion/ probiotic on the testis histology and se - men characteristics of male lambs. Twelve pre- puberal Noemi male lambs (2 \u00b1 0.4-month -old and 20 \u00b1 3.5 kg B.W) were randomly allocated into four groups. Animals in group 1 were con- trolled, orally given normal saline as the same schedule of treated animals. In group 2 animals were given daily oral 50 ml of an aqueous extract of dandelion leaves. In group 3 animals were given a daily 50 ml of cow 's milk probiotics, and in group 4 animals were given 50 ml of a 1:1 mixture (dandelion extract: probiotic). Animals were treated for 8 consecutive weeks. At puberty, semen ejaculates were collected weekly for fu r- ther 10 weeks. Thereafter, animals were sacr i- ficed and testicles were obtained, weighed and a histopathological study was performed on the testis. Results revealed that oral administration of the dandelion aqueous extract to prepuberal lambs exhibited disturbances in the histological architecture of the testicular sem eniferous t u- bules. Additionally, dandelion resulted in ed e- matic interstitial tissues with evident vacul a- tions. These deteriorations were reflected in less spermatogenesis ( i.e. less sperm concentration and ejaculate volume by 10% and 20%, respec- tively than controlled group). Also, the percent- age of sperm progressive motility was lower (P < 0.05) and dead sperm was higher (P < 0.05) in rams given dandelion than control. Administr a- tion of probiotic change in seminiferous tubules architec ture, however, ver y little vaculation with rare edema was observed. Administration of the synbiotic mixture revealed intermediate histopathological appearances. The highest sperm concentration, testosterone con - centration and advanced motility were obtained when probiotic was administered. In conclusion, although dandelion cures some hepatic ma l- functions in human, caution must be taken into consideration of the frequent ingestion of da n- delion for its harmful effect on male fertility.

INTRODUCTION Dandelion ( Taraxacum officinale ) leaves and roots have been used for hundreds of years to treat liver, gal l- bladder, kidney, and joint problems. Dandelion is tradi-tionally considered as an alternative and is used for co n- ditions as varied as eczema and cancer [1]. In North America, the Iroquois people prepared infusions and decoctions of the root and whole herb to treat kidney disease, dropsy, and dermatological conditions. As is the case today, dandelion leaves have also been used histor i- cally as a diuretic. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is also acclaimed as Copyright \u00a9 20 14 SciRes. OPEN ACCESS M. Zeitoun et al. / Open Journal of Animal Sciences 4 (2014) 23-30 24 a nontoxic herb with exceptional values for its choleretic, diuretic, anti -rheumatic and anti -inflammatory properties. acid, chlorogenic acid, luteolin, and luteolin have been isolated from the dandelion [2]. Dandelion fresh leaves contain protein, fiber, calcium, phos phorus, iron, potassium, thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin C, an d are especially high in vitamin A. The dried leaf is high in potassium (about 4%). Dandelion was included as a diuretic in the US pharmacopeia from 1831 to 1926 [3]. Based on its di u- retic effects, dandelion is often included in herbal weight loss and prem enstrual syndrome remedies. Some herba l- ists also recommend dandelion as an herb useful to help prevent atherosclerosis [4]. Others suggest that it may be a useful spring and fall tonic for patients with chronic osteoarthritis and those with a tendency to f orm gall - stones [5]. In addition to its medicinal uses, dandelion serves as a green salad in the gourmet's garden and as an unwelcome weed in the well -manicured lawn. The leaves are an excellent source of vitamin A. The ground roots are sometimes used as a substitute for chicory roots or coffee beans. The flowers are sometimes fermented into wine. The root is the part most often medicinally used [6]. The German Commission E approves it for use as a diu- retic and to treat dyspepsia, liver and gallbladder c om- plaints and appetite loss [7, 8]. Recent data on rats re - vealed that dandelion may have a serious side effect on male fertility. According to an earlier fertility study con - ducted on mice, plant materials derived from Taraxacum mongolicum and other c ompositae family pose no risk to fertility [9]. Fertility data specific to Taraxacum offici - nale are not available. However, recently an aqueous extract of dandelion acts as an anti -fertility agent, as it decreases male rat fertility in vivo . Experimental groups received an orally aqueous extract of dandelion for 60 days in two different sub lethal doses; 1/10 LD 50 as high dose and 1/20 LD 50 as low dose, whereas the control group received distilled water. The administration of the aqueous extract of Taraxacum officinale resulted in a significant decrease in testis weight in the two experi - mental groups. Also, distortion of mor phology of the seminiferous tubules and arrest in spermatogenesis were observed in the experimental groups [10]. Due to the controve rsy in this issue, the current study was designed to investigate the effect of administering an aqueous ex - tract of dandelion leaves without/ or with cow 's fermen - ted milk probiotic, on the histopathological appearance of ram testes in relation to semen characteristics. The inclusion of probiotic was targeted to ameliorate the ad - verse consequences on testicular function. 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 2.1. Animals and Treatments Twenty four prepuberal Noeimi male lambs aging 2 \u00b1 0.2 months and weighing 20 \u00b1 3.5 kg were raised in the experimental station of Qassim University, central of Saudi Arabia. Animals were offered pelleted ration in addition to green fodder ( Trifolium alexandrinum ) ac- cording to the requirement of the AOAC [11] and have accessibility t o clean tap water. Animals were randomly allocated into four treatment groups (n = 6/group). Group 1 animals served as control and orally given 50 ml saline (0.9% NaCl) every other day throughout the experimen - tation period (8 weeks), group 2 animals were given 50 ml of an aqueous extract of dandelion (6%) as the same schedule in the control, group 3 animals were given 50 ml fermented cow milk probiotic in the same manner and group 4 animals were given 50 ml of the mixture (dande - lion: probiotic; 1:1) in the same schedule. Animals were observed for health status and attainment of puberty signs ( i.e. the first mount with complete erection). 2.2. Semen Collection and Evaluation At puberty semen was collected via an artificial vagina and estrous ewe. Ejaculates were collected once a week for ten consecutive weeks. Gross and physical evalua - tions were done on each ejaculate ( i.e. ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, gross motili ty, individual progres - sive motility, percent dead sperm, semen pH). 2.3. Blood Collection and Serum Harvesting Concomitant to the semen collection a venipuncture Jugular blood sample was collected in heparin- free Vacu - tainer\u00ae tube of three animals withi n a treatment ( i.e. total 12 animals) once per week throughout 10 consecutive weeks for the determination of testosterone. Blood sa m- ples were cooled for two hours prior to the centrifu gation (3000 rpm/30 min/5C). Serum was harvested and 20C) for testosterone dete r- Testosterone Determinations Testosterone was determined according to Moltz et al. [12] by a commercial ELISA kit (HUMAN Diagnostic Co., Germany). Testosterone determinations sensitivity ran ge was 0 .05 - 0.09 ng/ml and intra - and inter -assay coeffi - cient of variations were 2.9 % and 4.7%, respectively. 2.5. Proximate Analysis of Dandelion Dry Leaves The chemical composition of dandelion was performed in the biochemistry laboratory and the mean data of an a- lyzing 10 samples of various locations of the crushed powder of dandelion leaves are shown in Table 1. 2.6. Milk and Bacterial Culture Milk samples were obtained from healthy lactating Copyright \u00a9 20 14 SciRes. OPEN ACCESS M. Zeitoun et al. / Open Journal of Animal Sciences 4 (2014) 23-30 25 Table 1.

Copenhagen Preparation of Probiotic Fermented Milk Preparation of probiotic fermented milk was carried out according the methods of traditional fermented manufacturing, which carried out using the methods de - scribed by [13]. Fresh cow milk have been s tandardized to achieve about 12% total solid content, and then heated at 85 C for 15 min, cooled to 40C , inoculated with pro- biotic bacteria (2%) and then incubated for 4 - 8 h at 42C. After coagulation, the curd has been tested for p H, then stirred in an electric blender and stored refrigerated (5C). The fresh milk was analyzed according to AOAC method [14]. The analysis data of milk were as follow; 2.90 fat, 8.66% soli ds not fat, 3.24% protein, 4.73% lac - tose, 0.65 % ash, 1.0261 kg/m 3 density and 0.408 C freezing point. 2.8. Preparation of Aqueous weres purchased market. Aqueous ex - tract of dandelion (Taraxacum officinalis) containing prebiotic ingredients (prebi otic extract) has been carried out using a method described by Melendeza and Ca - prilesa [15]. The plant material was pulverized in a grinder. Sixty grams of the pulverized material have been dissolved and extracted with 1000 ml hot distilled water in an e lectric blender which left running for 15 min. Af - terwards, the suspension was left at room temperature for 1 hour, then filtered twice, first through cheese -cloth (50% cotton/ 50% polyester) and then through filter paper (Whatman No.2). The clear aqueous extract was pre- served in sterile dark bottles (500 ml) at 20C until fur - ther use. 2.9. Preparation of Synbiotic Synbiotic syrup was prepared by combining equal volumes (v:v) of protective fermented milk Taraxacum officinalis ). 2.10. Statistical Analysis Data for semen parameters were analyzed by the least square analysis of variances [16]. Differences of means among treatments were compared by the Duncan 's Mul - tiple Range Test (DMRT) [17]. Significance level was considered at P < 0.05. 2.11. Histopathological Examination Samples of testis were taken, and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 hours. Paraffin sections 6 m thick were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) for the examination of tissue and cellular changes by light microscopy [18, 19]. 3. RESULTS 3.1. Semen Characteristics Throughout the entire study we mean by the term \"Prebiotic\" dandelion leaves aqueous extract. Semen ejaculate volume ( Figure 1) decreased signifi - cantly (P < 0.01) in rams given prebiotic (0.92 ml) as compared to control (1.18 ml) rams. Percent of reduction in ejaculate volume was about 22%. However, there were no obvious differences in ejaculate volume among other treatments (1.14 and 1.12 ml for symbiotic and probiotic, respectively). Sperm concentration ( Figure 2) was highest in rams given fermented milk probiotic (3.65 \u00d7 10 9 other treatments. Taraxacum officinale aqueous solut ion slightly (P > 0.05) decreased the sperm count (2.57 \u00d7 109 sperm/ml) by about 28% of the control value (2.8 \u00d7 109 sperm/ml).Combining the fermented milk with the dandelion extract ( i.e. synbiotic) amelio - rated this effect (2.76 \u00d7 109 sperm/ml). Sperm individual progressive motility ( Figure 3) was reduced (P < 0.001) in rams administered Taraxacum officinale (47.2%) as compared to control (54.2%), this represent about 15% decrease. On the other hand, probi- otic significantly (P < 0.001) increased sperm motility than control and other treatments (63.0% and 50.3% for probiotic and synbiotic rams, respectively). The increase that has been gained by drinking the fermented milk on sperm motility reached 16% above the control rams. Combining fermented milk with the dandelion did not enhance its effect on sperm motility. Furthermore, prebiotic (22.4%) and synbiotic (26.4%) increased (P < 0.001) percentage of dead sperm ( Figure 4) as compared to control (17.1%), however rams given probiotic gave ejaculates with the lowest percent of dead sperm (14.7%). The difference due to probiotic treatment on percent dead sperm was not statistically significant. Copyright \u00a9 20 14 SciRes. OPEN ACCESS M.

DISCUSSION Dandelion is a biennial herbaceous plant native to temperate areas, and it contains large amounts of inulin (12% - 15%) and olig ofructans in its tap roots [20 ,21]. Dandelion was found to have several medicinal benefits [22-24]. Dandelion compounds increase bile production and flow. The increased bile flow might improve choles - terol metabolism [24]. The leaves are used to help diges - tion, and as diuretic. Dandelion is promoted as a blood purifier. Dandelion root has been used to detoxify the liver and gallbladder, while its leaves used to support Photo 1.

A cross section in a control lamb (#48- control) testis showing normal histo- architecture seminiferous tubules, and interstitial tissue (\u00d7200). kidney function [25]. There have been well established reports of the significance of dandelion on hepatic cell function to synthesize the bile salts which are of rele - vance to human suffering liver cirrhosis. Above its effect on liver and bile secretion there exist a belief among public that dandelion enhances the a phrodisiac properties in males. Due to the lack of studies on the effect of dan- delion on male reproductive performance in general and on farm animals male fertility in specific, this study was implemented to monitor these effects in ruminant ani - mals si nce some pastures contain scattered plants of this weed. The testicular structure damage due to receiving dandelion aqueous extract might be due to its richness in alkaloids which might deteriorated the spermatogenesis within seminiferous tubules ( Photo 1). Leydig cells in the interstitium of testis are the primary source of testosterone, which stimulates the differentia - tion of the male ph enotype and spermatogenesis in the testes [26,27]. Loss of Leydig cells significantly contrib - the age -related of serum testosterone [28-30]. Substantial losses in serum testosterone may result in the inactivation of spermatogenesis. In a recent study in rats [10] similar findings were obtained ( i.e. reduced sperm count, low testosterone). They attributed these adverse effects of dandelion extract on sperm count and quality to the significant decrease of androgen re- ceptors in seminiferous tubules. There fects when Echinops echinatus roots (compositae) was given to male rats and these adverse effects on sperm and male hormone was attributed to the terpenoid content in the aqueous extract which exists in dandelion [31]. The decrease in sperm motility might be caused by a decrease in AT Pase activity which migh t be linked to defects in the ultrastructure of sperm [32]. However, in a study in mice there found a beneficial effect of dandelion extract administration by up regulat - ing estrogen, progesterone and follicle stimulating hor - mone receptors in females [ 33]. Moreover, it is unknown the cause -result relationship of the significant decline in testosterone accompanied with the decline in sperm count and percentage of progressive motility. It is well known that androgens are essential for normal sperma- togenesis and male fertility, but how androgens exert this effect remains uncertain. Androgen receptors (ARs) are expressed in several testicular cell types, but continuing uncertainty exists over which cell type mediates andro - gen control of spermatogenesis. Androgen signaling via Sertoli cells (SCs) is essential for complete spermato - genesis [34]. The present results were parallel to those in rats, who found that the testis cellular and histology structure is affected by toxicity of administration of the aq ueous ex - tract of dandelion ( Taraxacum officinale ) [10]. In the present study, cellular and tissue changes were noticed in the dandelion -treated lambs, including generalized and localized edema interstitial tissue. Edema is a clear sign of the toxic effect of aqueous extract of dandelion or in- creased permeability of interstitial -ar- tubules which could to edema. These dandelion animals als o showed testicular cell death signs which might be due to apoptosis or arrest in spermatogenesis. In the lambs fed probiotic alone or in combination with dandelion, the histological picture was improved than in dandelion. The signs of improvements were de creases in the histo -ar- chitecture disturbance of seminiferous in - creased cellular density of seminiferous tubules. This useful effect could be due to antioxidative stress effects or the synergizing effects on the spermatogenesis due to probi otic components [2- 4,35]. It has been found that probiotic bacteria exert an antioxidant effect on sperm to protect against the surrounding free radicals [36]. This would explain the less deteriorative effect of dandelion extract when mixed with probiotic (i.e. synbiotic) in our study. The adverse effect of dandelion and the ameliora- tive effect of probiotic on spermatogenesis and testos - production wouldn 't vary between rats (monogas for curing constipation, hepatic and gall bladder mal - function or even for treating joints disor ders must be cautioned not over consumption to avoid the adverse e f- fects on their fertil ity.
