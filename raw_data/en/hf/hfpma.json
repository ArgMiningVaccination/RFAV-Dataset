Currently, there is no effective treatment to reverse the brain damage associated with VaD. In general the drugs available for the management of cognitive problems in VaD are expensive and outcomes are uncertain. It is, therefore, important to seek out alternative approach es, which may prove effective, cheaper and safer. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been used for the treatment of dementia-like disorders for centuries. Data from many precl inical studies and so me clinical studies have suggested the potential effectiveness of CHM for the treatment of VaD. Based on the literature review conducted as part of this thesis, however, most of the studies were published in Chinese literature and failed to demonstrate methodological rigour or to report sufficient methodological deta il. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using scientific methods of diagnosis and outcome measures are urgently needed. Wei Nao Kang (WNK) is a three-herb formula developed by Xi Yuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences . Preclinical experi ments of WNK have demonstrated significant improvement in learning and memory function in VaD animal models in rats and mice. Human cas e studies have also signalled the potential value of WNK in VaD. Although the results of these studies were encouraging, strong scientific evidence from a well-designed RCT is still required. xix A rigorous clinical trial me thodology, including scientific diagnostic criteria and outcome measures, was designed and applie d to the evaluation of WNK for VaD. The trial was successfully conducted over a two-year period. Cognitive functions, as evidenced by the ADAS-cog, were signifi cantly improved in the study group taking WNK herbal medication compared with the placebo group. The ADAS-cog was simultaneously validated as a measure of cognitive function in VaD. Blinding was verified and no major adverse effects were found related to WNK treatment. However, neither group demonstrated l ong-lasting effect on a 16 weeks follow-up after completion of treatment. WNK demonstrated a significant effect on quality of life (measured by SF-36) and some effect on activities of daily living (measured by ADCS-ADL) in VaD patients. The SF-36 was validated as a measure of general health status and the ADCS-ADL as a measure of activities of daily living in patients with VaD. Both scales were proven sensitive to the presence of VaD, and provided useful supplementary outcome measures for VaD. A cerebral perfusion study was conducted to identify changes in cerebral blood flow and its relationship with clinical sy mptoms. The study showed that WNK had marked increases in blood flow in the inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions, both of which are closely related to cognitive function in human brains. This study has provided scientif ic evidence in support of th e clinical e ffect of WNK on VaD. In addition, it validated seve ral outcome measures in assessing improvements in cognitive func tions, activities of daily liv ing and quality of life in xx VaD patients. One of the highlights of this study is the application of SPECT scans as an outcome measure. This provided an excellent objective parameter for assessing the effects of WNK. To th e best of our knowledge, SPECT scanning has never been used in VaD trials of herbal medicines. PART ONE CHINESE HERBAL MEDICINE AND VASCULAR DEMENTIA _________________________ CHAPTER I General Introduction to Vascular Dementia __________________ _______________ ____________ This chapter outlines the current definiti on of vascular dementia (VaD), its classification, relevant diagnostic and a ssessment approaches, epidemiology, social and economic impact, and conventional management. 1.1 Vascular dementia - a definition Dementia, derived from the Latin ' de mens' , 'without mind', is an acquired clinical syndrome of long duration and is usually progressive. VaD, caused by vascular lesions of the brain, is a common form of dementia in older persons. It is characterised by a stepwise deterioration from a series of small strokes and a patchy distribution of neurologic defi cits affecting some functions and not others. Symptoms can be classified into three categories : impairment of cognition, psychiatric and behavioural features, and dysf unction associated with activ ities of daily living. These include confusion, problems with recent memory, wandering and getting lost in familiar places, loss of bladder or bowel control (incontinence), emotional problem s such as laughing or crying inappropriatel y, difficulty following instructions, and problems with basic skills such as handling money. The disease is commonly caused by ischem ic, hypoperfusive or haemorrhagic brain lesions due to cerebrovascula r or cardiovascular diseases , which lead to impairment of memory and cognitive function. Dementia in these cases appears to develop from 2a narrowing of the arteries supplying the brain with blood. Th e lack of bl ood can lead to many small areas of damage to the brain; small stroke s, but collectively devastating in their effect. The damage by sm all strokes is typically so light that the change is noticeable only as a series of small steps. However, over time, as more small blood vessels in the brain are blocked, there is noticeable gradual mental decline. Therefore, VaD is usually thought to be caused by many small strokes over time, rather than one large stroke. However, this is sometimes referred to as 'multi- infarct dementia' (MID), which was first introduced by Hachinski in 1974 and mainly caused by large blood-vessel infarcts (Hachinski et al, 1974). Usually, VaD develops over a period of three months after the small stroke incidents. If the VaD is caused by one large stroke, or develops in le ss than three months, th en it is referred to as 'acute onset vascular dementia', howev er acute onset vascular dementia is rare. The risk factors for VaD are not fully underst ood. However, vascular risk factors that precipitate strokes and coronary artery disease, such as diabetes mellitus, are believed to play an important role. Other Va D risk factors have also been identified and may be significant. These include a dvanced age, gender, family history, education, high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, hyperhomocysteinaemia, atrial fibrillation and obesity. The pathophysiology of VaD in interac tions between vascular aetiologies (cerebrovascular disorders and vascular fact ors), changes in the brain (infarcts, white matter lesions, atrophy), host factors (a ge, education) and cognition (Chui, 1989; Skoog, 1998). The patho-anatomical classifica tion is based on the size of the vessel responsible (Brun, 1994). Large vessel deme ntia or cortical VaD and small vessel 3dementia or subcortical VaD are the two co mmon types. In addition, others such as hypoperfusion dementia are included (see Table 1. 1). Table 1.1 Classification of vascular dementia 1. Large vessel dementia: cortical VaD or 2. VaD 3. Hypoperfusive dementia 4. Haemorrhagic dementia 5. Hereditary and other VaDs 6. Alzheimer's disease with cerebral vascular disease VaD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are si milar in many ways (see Table 1. 2), and can be confused. The most significant differe nce between the two is that the cause of VaD is clear and VaD can be diagnos ed using physiological evidence of cerebrovascular disease. In terms of disease progression, AD generally occurs first as a slow loss of memory f unction, and then as a gradual decline into eventual dementia. VaD, however, generally occurs suddenly following a stroke. The patient often declines in a stepwise fashion, with e ach step occurring afte r a stroke or series of mini-strokes. 4Table 1.2 Differentiation between vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease Vascular dementia Alzheimer's disease Cause Pathological changes Brain imaging Onset Progress of disease Course Cerebrovascular disease Multiple blood-vessel infarct Single or multiple strokes, or white matter lacunes, or combinations Suddenly following a stroke Declines in a stepwise fashion, with each step occurring after a stroke or series of mini-strokes About 5 years Uncertain Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles Brain shrinkage, especially in the hippocampus; and/or larger ventricles of brain Slow onset Gradual decline into eventual dementia 8-10 years 1.2 Diagnosis of Vascular Dementia The two cardinal elements implemented in the clinical criteria for VaD are the definition of the cognitive syndrome of deme ntia and the definition of the vascular cause of the dementia (Erkinjuntti, 1994; Wetterling et al, 1996). Since the 1970s, several clinical criteria for VaD have been used. The most widely used criteria for VaD include the Hachinski Ischemic Scale (HIS), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, 4th Version (DSM-IV), the International Statistical Classification of Disease, 10th revision (ICD-10), the Calif ornia Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centres (ADDTC) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and St roke-Association Internationa l Pour LA Recherche Ischemic Scale (HIS) In 1974, Hachinski, who had a significant im pact in this field, introduced the term \"multi-infarct dementia\" (Hachinski et al, 1974) and developed the HIS (Hachinski, 1983) to differentiate multi-infarct demen tia from Alzheimer's disease (see Table 1.3). Although the HIS does not include a defi nition of vascular dementia, it has been used in conjunction with other dementia cr iteria, such as DSM-IV or ICD-10. Most studies have shown that HIS successfully di fferentiates VaD from AD when clinical diagnoses were compared to neuropatholog ical studies. Some st udies have reported that the traditional HIS has higher reli ability than the newer criteria for VaD. Table 1.3 Clinical features of th e Hachinski Ischemic Scale (HIS) Feature Score Abrupt onset Stepwise deterioration Fluctuating course Nocturnal confusion Relative preservation of personality Depression Somatic complaints Emotional incontinence History of hypertension History of strokes Evidence of associated atherosclerosis Focal neurologic symptoms Focal neurologic signs 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 *A total score of 4 or less indicates Alzheimer's di sease; a total of 7 or more indicates vascular dementia. 61.2.2 The DSM-IV Criteria The Diagnostic and Statistical Ma nual of Mental Disorder, 4th Version (DSM-IV) criteria (Table 1.4) define VaD from the appearance of focal neurological signs and symptoms or from the presence of laborat ory evidence such as neurological damage that is indicative of cerebrovascular dise ase and considered to be related to the dementia. It is specified by sudden cogniti ve and functional losses and no detailed brain imaging is required. However, the criteria are probably too broad and lack detailed clinical and radiol ogical guidelines to be used for this research proposal (American Psychiatric Association, 1992). Table 1.4 The DSM-IV definition for VaD Focal neurological signs and symptoms or laboratory evidence of focal neurological damage The cognitive deficits cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning and represent a si gnificant decline from a previously higher level of functioning The focal neurological signs, symptoms and laboratory evidence are judged to be aetiologically related to the disturbance The deficits do not occur exclusively during the course of delirium The course is characterised by sustai ned periods of clinical stability punctuated by sudden significant cognitive and functional losses 1.2.3 The ICD -10 criteria In 1992, the World Health Organisation de veloped the Internat ional Statistical Classification of Disease, 10th revision (ICD-10) criteria (WHO, 1992) for VaD. This set of criteria requires unequal distribution of cognitive deficits, focal signs as evidence of focal brain damage and signifi cant cerebrovascular disease judged to be 7aetiologically related to the dementia. The ICD-10 criteria for VaD have been shown to be highly selective and only a subset of those fulfilling the general criteria for ICD-10. VaD can be classified into de fined subtypes (see Table 1.5). The shortcomings of the criteria, however, are a lack of detailed guidelines (for example, unequal cognitive deficits and neuro-imaging), lack of aetiological cues and heterogeneity. Table 1.5 Subtypes of VaD in the ICD-10 classification onset Mixed cortical and subcortical Other 1.2.4 The ADDTC Criteria and th e NINDS-AIREN Criteria Both of the two newly developed criteria have improved the reliability of VaD diagnosis. The California Alzheimers' Di sease Diagnostic And Treatment Centres (ADDTC) criteria (Chiu et al, 1992) are exclusively for VaD and require for the diagnosis of probable VaD \"evidence of tw o or more ischemic strokes by history, neurologic signs, and/or neuroimaging study, and evidence of at least one infarct outside the cerebellum by CT or MRI\". The NINDS-AIREN (Roman et al., 1993) criteria, however, require dementia s yndrome, cerebrovascular disease and a relationship between them. Ce rebrovascular disease is de fined by the presence of focal neurological signs and de tailed brain imaging evidence of ischemic changes in the brain. A relationship between dementia a nd cerebrovascular disorder is based on the onset of dementia within three mont hs following a recognized stroke, or an 8abrupt deterioration in cogni tive functions, or fluctuati ng, stepwise progression of cognitive deficits. The criteria include a list of features consistent with the diagnosis, as well as a list of features that make th e diagnosis uncertain or unlikely. In addition different levels of certainty of the clini cal diagnosis (probable, possible, uncertain) are included. Although there are some si milar requirements for the diagnosis of probable VaD, the two systems differ in thei r definitions of the best way to quantify both dementia and stroke. As evaluated neuropathologically, the ADDTC criteria seem to be more sensitive and the NINDS -AIREN criteria more specific (see Table 1.6). Table 1.6 NINDS-AIREN criteria for probable VaD 1. Dementia symptoms 2. Cerebrovascular disease, defined by Focal signs on neurological examination; and Evidence of relevant CVD by brain imaging (CT or MRI) 3. A relationship between the above two diso rders, manifested by the presence of one or more of the following: Onset of dementia within 3 months following a recognized stroke; or Abrupt deterioration in cognitive f unctions; or fluctuating, stepwise progression of cognitive deficits 91.2.5 Summary The current diagnostic criteria for VaD are not interchangeable. The HIS criteria are more likely to be used together with othe r criteria to identify VaD from other types of dementias. The DSM-IV and the ICD- 10 do not require brain imaging. While the ADDTC criteria require at least one infa rct outside the cerebellum, the NINDS- AIREN criteria require brain imaging evidence of multiple large vessel or single strategically placed or multiple lacunes or extensive white matter lesions (WMLs) (see Table 1.7).

Compared to the ADDTC criteria, the NINDS-AIREN criteria are more specific and they better exclude combined cases of 10AD (54% vs 29%). The NINDS-AIREN criteria are currently most widely used in clinical drug trials on VaD, despite their limitations (G old et al, 1997). 1.3 Clinical Assessments of Patients with VaD Two important requirements for assessing therapeutic benefits in clinical tri als are 1) the inclusion of appropriate patients and 2) the use of appropriate outcome measures. Similar to diagnostic criteria, there are cu rrently no standardized outcome measures guidelines available for conducting clinical pharmacotherapy trials in VaD patients. However, there are currently several widely used outcome measures in VaD studies: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Hasegawa's Dementia Scale (HDS) Alzheimer's Disease Co-operative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) These five are the most widely used asse ssment criteria, details of which follow. 1.3.1 MMSE The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is an 11 question measure that tests five areas of cognitive function; orientat ion, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. It is a brief, quantitat ive measure of cognitive status in adults, and is one of the most widely used cl inical instruments for quickly detecting cognitive impairment and assessing its sever ity, as well as for monitoring cognitive 11changes over time. MMSE is the most comm only used rating scale in clinical VaD trials - almost two-thirds of clinical trials on VaD have adopted MMSE as an outcome measure. In a clinical trial conducted by Wang et al (2000), they used si ngle entry scoring of MMSE as an outcome measure to probe th e effect of the \"nourishing kidney to induce resuscitation\" on psychol ogical evaluation tables in patients with VaD. The study showed that the formula could increas e the total score of MMSE, and reverse the process of VaD in psychol ogical evaluation tabl e. In another study (Itoh et al, 1999) evaluating the effectiveness of trad itional Chinese medicine in VaD, the results showed that the scores of MMS E improved with treatment using the TCM formula. Several studies on Ginkgo biloba for cognitive impairment and VaD, such as Charter et al (1987) and Brautigam et al (1998) used MMSE al ong with other scales as outcome measures. 1.3.2 HDS The Hasegawa's Dementia Scale (HDS) has been used exclusively in East Asian countries for both screening and assessment of dementia. It consists of nine simple questions and evaluates the frontal functio n as well as orie ntation, memory, and attention. It is usually used in conj unction with MMSE or Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Examples of its use include the inves tigation of the clinical effect of Zhi Ling Tang for treatment of VaD, where Zheng et al .(2000) observed the changes of revised HDS scores before and after treatment, and found the revised HDS scores were 12improved significantly, as compared to befo re treatment (p<0.01). Chen et al (2000) adopted HDS and MMSE as outcome m easures to assess the efficacy of Yi Zhi capsule in treating VaD. After 2 months of a randomised, placebo controlled study, they found Yi Zhi capsule could increase MMSE a nd HDS scores of VaD patients. 1.3.3 ADCS-ADL As one of the three sets of symptoms of VaD, the changes of activities of daily living (ADL) should be always taken into account . The Alzheimer's Disease Co-operative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory (G alasko et al, 1997) is a caregiver rated questionnaire of 23 items, with possible scor es over a range of 0-78 where 78 implies full functioning with severity and is the primary tool for collecting ADL data. There is consensus that cognitive and global function measures, an d assessments of abilities to perform ADL must be included as part of the optimal assessment battery in VaD trials (Leys et al, 1999). Examples of its use include a study by Birks et al (2003) which showed that ADL are improved using Ginkgo biloba (dose less than 200 mg/day) compared with placebo over a period of 12 weeks (mean differ ence -1.10, 95%CI: -1.79 to -0.41, P<0.01). In another study, changes of ADL, MMSE, an d clinical symptoms were observed during a study on the effect of Bai Sui Fang Oral Liquid in treating VaD. The MMSE and ADL scores of patients in the TCM treatment group elevated significantly compared to those in the western medicine gr oup (Xia et al, 2002). Huang et al (2002) observed the therapeutic effect of Nao Huan Dan capsule in treating mild and moderate cases of VaD. Forty five patients w ith VaD, which were subjected to DSM-IV, were randomly allo cated to two groups for a three month 13treatment course. The therapeutic effect s were evaluated by scoring of MMSE and ADL, and results showed that scores of MMSE and ADL increased after treatment. 1.3.4 FAQ The Functional Activities Questionnaire (F AQ), a maximum of 30 points scale, is another commonly used scale to evaluate patients' daily functional activities. Examples of its use include Chang et al (1998) observed the clinical effect of electro- acupuncture and acupuncture on VaD. Assess ments of FAQ, HDS and neurological deficit scoring were done before and after treatment. They found the FAQ scores lowered and HDS elevated more in the el ectro-acupuncture group than those of the acupuncture group. Zhang et al (2002) used FAQ to detect patients' ADL, MMSE, and HDS. The FAQ increased rema rkably in the TCM treatment group, compared with the western medicine gr oup (p<0.01). They concluded that FAQ, MMSE and HDS were relatively higher than other rating scales in terms of sensitivity and specificity. 1.3.5 ADAS-cog The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment S cale-cognitive subscal e (ADAS-cog) is a sensitive psychometric scale for measuring cognitive function, and is routinely and most widely utilised in western medicine clinical trials conducted in patient s with VaD. It is a specifically designed measure fo r dementia patients, is well standardized and seems to be the most useful measure. It is more detailed than MMSE, takes more 14time to administer and needs more e quipment to conduct. The ADAS-cog, however, has not been widely adopted in TCM clinic al trials to date (Kolibas et al, 2000). Examples of the use of ADAS-cog include Memory Centres of America Inc, New York (Le Bar et al, 2000) conducted a 26 weeks double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial of Ginkgo biloba in Dementia. The primary outcome measures used included the ADAS-cog, GERRI and Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI). In the group receiving EGB-761 (an extraction of Gingko biloba ), 26 percent of the patients achieved at least a 4 point impr ovement on the ADAS-cog, compared to 17 percent with placebo ( P=0.04). Some other outcome measures such as Deme ntia Rating Scales (Paul et al, 2003) and Clinical Global Impression (Van Donden, 2000) are also often used in the clinical trials on VaD. 1.4 Epidemiology of VaD VaD is a major cause of mental and physical disability in the aging population in western countries (Leys et al, 1999). It is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and accounts for 20-30 percent of all cases of dementing disorders (Sachdev & Brodaty, 1999). In Asia and some developing countries, the prevalence of VaD may ev en equal or exceed that of AD. The prevalence rate of VaD is 1.5 percent in western countries and approximately 2.2 percent in Japan (Jorm et al, 1987). In Japan it accounts fo r 50 percent of all dementias that occur in individuals older than 65 years. In Europe, VaD and mixed dementia account for approximately 20 percent and 40 percent of cases, respectively. 15In Latin America, 15 percent of all de mentias are vascular. Although comparisons between regional and ethnic groups are made difficult due to the methodological differences between studies, it is generall y accepted that the ageing of the population will lead to a rapid increa se in the number of VaD cases (Edmond et al, 2000). In community based studies in Australia , the prevalence rate for VaD and mixed dementia is 13 percent and 28 percent, resp ectively. The prevalence rate of dementia is 9 times higher in patients who have had a stroke than in controls. One year after a stroke, 25 percent of patients develop ne w onset dementia, and within 4 years following a stroke the relative risk of in cidental dementia is 5.5 percent (Edmond et al, 2000). Although the incidence of VaD varies wide ly between studies, undoubtedly due to methodological differences, it seems clear th at the incidence of VaD increases less rapidly with age compared to AD (Jorm et al, 1987). VaD is more common in men than in women, which may be because men are more likely than women to suffer from strokes. VaD becomes increasing prev alent as people grow older. The number of people affected by VaD rises dramatica lly during and after the sixth decade. Men tend to have a higher incidence of VaD at younger ages and women tend to have a higher incidence of AD in very old age. A higher incidence of mortality has been reported for patients with VaD (30.4-63.6 percent) than patients with AD (22.6-33.8 percent), presumably because of the coexistence of other atherosc lerotic disease (Brodaty et al, 1993; Barclay et al, 1985). The average survival time in AD has been found to be 8-10 years, although the range can be quite variable. By comparison, th e mean survival time for VaD has been 16found to be around five years (Geldmacher et al, 1996). The 5-year survival rate is 39 percent for patients with VaD compared to 75 percent for age matched controls (Herbert & Brayne, 1995). In summary: The prevalence and incidence of VaD ri se with age, at least until age 90. Cerebrovascular disease is a relatively more important cause of dementia for males than for females and in Asia than in western countries. The survival time of VaD is less than AD. 1.5 Social and Economic Impact of VaD VaD significantly affects patient quality of life and imposes a huge financial burden on the family, community and healthcare syst em. It carries a huge inconvenience to patients, and living with a person with a mental disability is an unremitting burden due to decline in cognitive abilities, th e loss of functional capability, and the dwindling companionship. According to a disability survey conduc ted in 1999 by the Australian Bureau of Statistics more than 90 per cen t of people with dementia are classified as disabled or having restricted activity, cau sing a major impact on the Activities of Daily Living (ADL). This, together with the cognitive impairment and psychiatric and behavioural disorders associated with dementia, brings an enormous amount of inconvenience in their daily lives and seriously reduces pa tients' quality of life. Additionally, risk factors for VaD such as hypertension, car diovascular disease, cerebrovascular 17disease and diabetes mellitus have their own morbidity and may have independent effects on family members prior to the onset of stroke or VaD (Edmond et al, 2000). About half the people with dementia live in the community, with assistance from a range of sources. Support is provided by family members and in some cases friends, in conjunction with federal and state/te rritory funded home-based and community care programs. The impacts on families who care for a person with dementia can be far reaching. Many people with dementia live with their adult children and their family, which may include grandchildren, w ho are also affected by the stresses and frustrations of caring for a person with de mentia. The increasing demands of physical care impose escalating stresse s on family carers (Brodaty & Hadzi-Pavlovic, 1990). In 2002, there were 162,000 people with deme ntia in Australia and 1000 Australians are newly diagnosed with VaD every week. Th e total financial cost of dementia in Australia in 2002 was estimated at $ 6.6 billon - over $40,000 per annum per person with dementia. Australia has an aging population a nd age is one of the major risk factors for VaD, hence the prevalence of Va D is forecast to increase rapidly over the coming decade (Access Economics, 2003). The di rect cost associated with dementia to the health system includes running f acilities such as nursing homes, GPs and specialists' services, pharmaceutical and other medications, and the provision of community care programs. In 2002, the direct health costs alone of dementia were calculated at $3.2 billon and estimated to nearly double this decade. The indirect cost, including income lost, equipment and aids, and welfare and disability payments etc, was estimated at $2.2 bi llion. In addition to these, non-financial costs such as 'years of health life' lost due to dementia is another burden of the disease. In 2002 18over 5,000 Australians died from dementia, and dementia cost 117,000 years of healthy life for Australians (combined mortality and morbidity burden) (Access Economics, 2003). In summary, there are thr ee major impacts of VaD: On patients: pain, suffering, di sability and quality of life On families and carers: phys ical care and mental burden On the community and health system : financial and non-financial costs. 1.6 Conventional Therapy for VaD Treating VaD, and the cognitive impairments associated with it, is of primary importance. Unfortunately, there is scant information about the specific medical treatment for VaD. Medical management fo cuses on prevention of further cerebral damage, i.e. control of vascular risk f actors (Katzi, 1999; Roma n, 1999; Pantoni et al, 2000; Williams et al, 2000). The options for this include control of hypertension, antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant therapy, control of diabetes mellitus, stopping smoking, reducing hypercholesterolaemia. Currently there are only a limited number of studies that show VaD might be improved with donezepil (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor - ACHEL) (Wilkinson et al, 2003) and memantine (an uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor - NMDA-R) (Wilcock et al, 2002). Erkinjuntti et al (2002) also reported that galantamine (a reversible, competitive ACHE I and a positive allosteric modulator of nAChRs) demonstrated clinically important benefits in the symptomatic treatment of patients with probable VaD or AD with cerebrovascular diseas e. Parnetti et al (1996) 19looked at the usefulness of posatirelin (a syntheti c peptide having modulatory activity on the monoaminergic and cholinergi c systems and neurotr ophic effects) in the treatment of VaD. Their results showed a significant improvement in intellectual performance, orientation, motivation, a nd memory as compared to placebo. In a study of the effects of propentofylline (a xant hine derivative that blocks reuptake of adenosine by neurons and gila cells, and which purportedly reduced ischemic nerve cell deaths in the brain) on patients with Va D, Mielke et al (1996) found that visual information processing was improved in the treatment group, and that there was also a trend towards the slowing of the progression of cognitive deterioration as measured by the MMSE and digit symbol subtest. In addition, a number of studies have also suggested that control of risk factors for cerebrovascular disease may be useful as a preventive measure against VaD. Aspirin and ticlopidine (antip latelet agents) have been found to be useful in preventing strokes and improving cognition in patients with vascular dementia (McPherson et al, 1996; Jorm AF, 1994). Mulrow et al (1998) f ound antihypertensive agents such as nitrendipine or nimodipine were effectiv e in reducing the rate of stroke. Cessation of smoking and control of blood lipids may be associated with improved cognition in vascular dementia. The latter has been shown with heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL precipitation (HELP), in which cogniti on improved in these treated patients. A few systematic reviews have been conducted on western medicine for the treatment of VaD or AD with cerebrovascul ar disease. However, almost all of the studies concluded that there was limited or no evidence that showed that these medications might be used as an effectiv e and long term treatment for VaD, although 20some of them have shown some benefits on cognition or activities of daily living. Furthermore, these drugs are expensive and are not on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) listing for treatment of VaD in Australia. Key studies cover acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for VaD (Fisher M & Bowler JV, 2000), the overview of galantamine treatment for Va D by Kurz (2002), pentoxifylline (a hemorrheological agent) (Sha & Callaha n, 2003), pirecetam for dementia or cognitive impairment (Frampton et al, 2003) , lecithin for deme ntia and cognitive impairment (Higgins & Flicker, 2003), vinpocetine for cognitive impairment and dementia (Szatmari & Whitehouse , 2003), nim odipine (calcium channel blocker) for primary degenerative, mixed and vascular dementia (Lez-Arrieta,, 2003), and aspirin (antiplatelet agent) for VaD (Williams et al, 2003). In general, the drugs available for the management of cognitive problems in dementia are expensive and the treatmen t outcomes are uncertain. Elderly patients with cognitive problems also often have multiple comorbidities and are on polypharmacy. It is not unusual for other drugs to interact with the cholinesterase inhibiters or other agents for VaD. It is therefore important to seek out alternative approaches, which may prove cheaper and safer. 21________________ CHAPTER II Traditional Chinese Medicine for Vascular Dementia __________________ __________________ ___________ This chapter summarises hogenesis, and patholog ical character of VaD from a traditional Chin ese medicine (TCM) point of view, and introduces the current management of VaD using TC M and other complementary medicine therapies. 2.1 Vascular dementia - A Traditiona l Chinese Medicine Point of View What is referred to as VaD in modern Ch inese medical literature mainly corresponds to the traditional Ch inese disease catalogues of feeble-mindedness ( Chi Dai memory ( Jian Wang ), deranged speech ( Yan Yu Cuo Lan ), and withdrawal and mania ( Dian Kuang ) (Flaws & Lake, 2001). The earliest documented record regarding VaD (Dai Bing) is from the Qin Dynasty period. In one of the three main Han dynasty classics of medicine, Huang Di Nei Jing (the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic), Yellow Emperor for the first time described and discusse d the diagnosis and treatment of Dai Bing (Flaw & Lake, 2001). Also in late Han Dynasty, Zhang Zhong Jing described a number of mental-emotional diseases and classified dementia as \"heart confusion\". Zhu Dan Xi, one of th e four great medical masters of the Jin-Yuan Dynasty, initially mentioned the medica l terminology of \"impaired memory ( Jian Wang )\", which is one of the most important symptoms of VaD in western medicine. 22The majority of the descriptions of anci ent Chinese medicine on pathogenesis in VaD focused on internal causes, such as ageing and vital deficiency, the internal injury of the seven emotions, diet a nd fatigue. Although the pathogenesis of VaD includes deficiency, phlegm, blood stasis, the abnormal flow of qi and blood, injury of seven emotions etc, it can be genera lised into deficiency and excess: the deficiency mainly located at the kidney, while the excess mainly referred to phlegm, blood stasis and depression. Modern medical specialists further improve and complement the theory of pathogenesis according to the integration of their clinical experience and modern research achievement. Zhao et al (1997) t hought that the disease location of VaD is on the heart and brain, and closel y related to liver, spleen and kidney; its pathological character \"deficiency, phlegm and blood stas is\" is found to corres pond to its modern medicine pathology of high blood li pid and high blood agglutination. Xie et al (1999) defined \"D eficiency of kidney essence, coagulation of phlegm and blood stasis\" as the pathological basis of VaD. The generati on of fire and wind caused by phlegm stagnation is the aff ect factor of condition fluctuation 38. According to Xie, accumulation of evil, generation of turbid pathogens and destruction of brain collateral and marrow are the main causes of VaD. Zhang et al (2002) pointed out that VaD has the same phys ical constitutional factors and similar pathogenesis as stroke. It is located in the brain, and involves liver, kidney and spleen. The pathological character is deficiency in origin and excess in 23superficiality where origin refers to deficiency of essence- qi, and superficiality means wind, fire, and phlegm and blood stasis. Hu et al (1998) argued that VaD's clinical character of frequent recurrences, and persistent incurability corresponded to the basic pathological ch aracter of collateral disorder. Its basic pathological changes are asthenic obstru ction, blood block, speculated damage of vessel endothelium a nd the disorder of interaction of blood constituents, and is probably one of th e pathophysiological bases of collateral disorder. In conclusion, according to TCM philosophy, VaD is located within the Brain and involves Liver, Kidney, Heart and Spleen. It relates closel y to the ebb and flow of essence-qi in the Kidney. The disorder of visceral yin and yang, qi and blood caused by ageing and vital deficiency, internal injury of seven emotions, phlegm, blood stasis and turbid poison and obstruction with in the brain channel and collaterals lead to the occurrence of VaD (Yan, 1995). Its pathological character is deficiency in the root and excess in superficiality. The use of TCM therapies fo r treatment of ageing relate d disorders dates back 5000 years to ancient China, where herbal reme dies were used to boost memory function and increase longevity. Traditional Chinese medicine is a complete medical system, with principles of diagnosis and ther apy which differ from those of modern medicine. Treatment may consist of a single herb, or the prescription of a mixture of herbs which will both increase the efficacy of an individual herb and reduce its toxicity. In addition, different forms of prep arations have been adopted to facilitate 24their utilization. The follo wing section provides an overview of commonly used TCM therapies for the treatment of VaD and outlines the current scientific evide nce for their effectiveness. Current evidence is usually provided through results of clinical trials. However, accurate diagnosis is always an issue, making it difficult to ascertain what type of de mentia is being assessed. 2.2 Individualised Treatment by Pattern Identification Treatment based on pattern identification is the essence of the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Although in recent years, have been an increasing number of Chinese medicine preparations being developed for VaD, treatment based on pattern discrimination is st ill the most common method adopted by TCM clinicians. Pattern differentiation, mainly according to pathological changes of viscera and taking aetiology into consideration as well, are the generally used diagnostic and treatment principles in clinical studies . According to the different features accompanied by the patients' condition changes, Xie Ying Zhen et al (1999) divided VaD into three stages: platform stage, fl uctuation stage and deterioration stage. Platform stage is characterised by phlegm and blood stasis blocki ng in collaterals, while fluctuation stage is characterised by the stagnation of phlegm, turbid phlegm blocking mental or wild phlegm, blood stas is and interior disturbance of the phlegm heat, and in the final stage, turbid phleg m and blood stasis tangled with each other, which lead to the generation of wind and fire. Li (2002) classified VaD into two subgr oups: 1) pattern of deficiency of qi complicated with blood stasis, turbid phlegm blocking brain and the therapeutic principle to be applied: supplementing qi and activating blood circulation, using a 25modified Bu Yang Huan Wu decoction; 2) pattern of deficiency of kidney and marrow, the therapeutic principle to be applied: replenishes the kidney and strengthens the essence, promoting resu scitation and benefiting intelligence, the herbal treatment used m odified Di Huang Yin Zi. Hu (1992) classified VaD into four diffe rent types: 1) pattern of phlegm heat disturbing interior, therapeutic principle ap plied: clears heat and eliminates the phlegm; and treated by Wen Da n Tang; 2) pattern of hyp eractivity of liver-Yang; therapeutic principle: nourishing Yin and suppress hyperactive Yang, and treated by Zhen Gan Xi Feng Tang; 3) pattern of bl ood stasis disturbing heart; therapeutic principle applied: activate blood circulation and remove blood stasis, and treated by Tao Hai Cheng Qi Tang; and 4) pattern of deficiency of Marrow Sea (brain), therapeutic principle applied: replen ish and strengthen kidney-essence. According to their own clinical experien ce, Jiang & Xu (2000) generalised four therapeutic principles of TCM treatment on VaD: 1) activate the blood circulation and remove blood stasis to clear brain ch annels; 2) disperse phlegm and remove turbidity; 3) nourish the liver and kidney to tonify brain marrow; and 4) replenish heart and improve the function of th e spleen to benefit intelligence. Ma (2000) classified VaD into three differe ntial subtypes: 1) deficiency of kidney- essence pattern, therapeutic principle applied: activate the function of the spleen, nourish kidney, and strengthen essen ce and marrow; 2) deficiency of qi and blood stasis blocking collaterals pattern, therapeutic principle applied: nouris h qi to activate blood circulation, invigorate the sp leen and kidney; and 3) stagnation of 26phlegm and blood stasis patter n, therapeutic principle app lied: remove blood stasis, alleviate water retention and clear away toxic materials. Kong & Kong (1997) classified VaD into 5 su btypes: 1) pattern of heart and liver fire, and phlegm heat disturbance in the inte rior, therapeutic principle applied: clear away heart and liver fire, clear the hollow viscera and remove phlegm; 2) pattern of stagnation of liver qi, and blood stasis caused by deficiency of qi, therapeutic principle applied: relieve depression of the liver qi, activate blood circulation; 3) pattern of deficiency of water and excess of fire, turbid phlegm blocking mental, therapeutic principle applied: nourish Yin to clear fire, remove phlegm to open the aperture of the heart. 4) pa ttern of deficiency of the h eart and spleen, and blood stasis due to deficiency of qi, therapeutic principle applied: supplement qi and activate blood circulation, nourish spleen and kidne y; and 5) deficien cy of Marrow Sea, stagnation of phlegm and blood stasis patter n, therapeutic principl e applied: activate the function of spleen and tonify ki dney, remove phlegm and blood stasis. In summary, although there are many patterns and therapeutic principles applied or published, the most common applied pa tterns identified for VaD are: Qi deficiency with blood stasis , turbid phlegm blocking brain Deficiency of Kidney essence and brain-marrow Liver and heart fire, Phlegm heat disturbing Brain channel Hyperactivity of liver yang or stagnation of liver qi Deficiency of heart and spleen 272.3 Specialised Treatment Principles and Formulations Being an incurable disorder where patients can experience a variet y of of reccurring clinical symptoms such as deficiency a nd excess, it is very difficult to categorise VaD into clinical identification patterns. Therefore, many TCM clinicians would prefer to treat VaD based on specialised therapeutic principles and formulations. With these, they can treat the origin and the superficiality at the same time, by integrating reinforcement and eliminati on and thus achieve marked therapeutic effectiveness. Table 2.1 Specialised CHM t reatments and formulations Treatment principles Formulations Compositions Supplementing the kidney and strengthening the brain, activating blood circulation 1. Jiannao Yizhi Granule qi and activating blood circulation, invigorating mental activity and 1. Huishen and strengthening the brain, ac tivating blood circulation', is a most commonly applied treatment principle for VaD and increasingl y used by clinicians as a therapeutic principle to develop their specialised formul a. A few samples of this application are as follows: 29Zhang Boli et al (2002) conducted a random ised double blind multi centre clinical trial of VaD patients treated with Jian Nao Yi Zhi granule, which was developed according to the therapeutic principle of supplementing kidney, strengthening brain and activating blood stasis. 242 patients with mild or moderate VaD were included, of which 89 cases were allocated into the TCM group, 106 cases in the western medicine group and 47 cases in the pl acebo group. MMSE, BBS and TCM symptom classification evaluation were assessed befo re and after the treat ment. They found the total effective rate of Jian Nao Yi Zhi granule was 58.4 percent, showing a better effect than the placebo group and western medicine group. Liu et al (2002) observed the effect of Jian-Nao mixture for treating VaD patients. The DSM-IV and the NINDS-AIREN criteria were used as diagnostic criteria. The changes in clinical symptoms, the sc ore of HDS, MMSE, NFDS and ADL, and cerebral blood flow were assessed or obs erved before and after treatment and the results showed that Jian-Nao mixture could improve clin ical symptoms, activity of daily life and cerebral bl ood circulation as well. Zhi Ling decoction, a TCM prescription designed for replenishing kidney essence, supplementing marrow, removing blood stasis and phlegm, tonify ing the brain and invigorating mental activity, was used to treat 32 cases of VaD patients. After treatment, the levels of serum cholesterol and plasma lipid peroxides were lowered; the content of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and the activity of superoxide dismutase in red blood cell was significantl y elevated; the cereb ral blood flow was increased; latent period of P300 and P3 wa ves was shortened while the (P<0.01 or 30P<0.05) and clinical symptoms were im proved. The total effective rate was 81.3 percent, indicating that Zhi Ling Decoction exhibits rela tively good therapeutic effects for treating VaD (Yan et al, 2000). In summary, Jian Nao Yi Zhi granule, Jian-Nao mixture and Zhi Ling Decoction, as their names indicate, all have the functions of strengthening br ain and invigorating intelligence. 'Brain is the marrow sea', and kidney has the function of storing essence marrow, so all these formulae employed kidney tonifying herbs to address the root of kidney deficiency. Yiqi Huoxue Kaiqiao Yizhi refers to supplementing qi and activating blood circulation, invigorating mental activity and opening the brain. Chen et al (2002) observed the clinical effect of Chinese patent medicine Hui Shen Dan granule in treating VaD. Hui Shen Dan , a TCM prescription designed for nourishing essence- qi, activating blood circulation a nd removing phlegm was used to treat 18 cases of VaD, while 30 cases were given the western medicine hydergine as control group. MMSE, the ability of temporal orientation and space orientation was observed. After 6 months of treatment, they found the total effective rates were 89.83 percent for TCM treatment and 60 percent for hydegine treatment; the sustaining improving rate was 99.06 percen t and 88.33 percent re spectively, and the deteriorative rates were 0.94 percent a nd 16.67 percent respectively; showing a significant clinical effect from the Hui Shen Dan . 31Xiang et al (2002) explored the effect of \"supplementing qi, activating blood circulation and removing phlegm\" on the le vel of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) nts. The levels of ET-1 and CGRP were measured by radioimmunoassay. Results show ed that the ET-1 increased markedly and CGRP level decreased markedly (p<0.01), when the TCM group was compared with the placebo group. They concluded that \"supplementing qi, activating blood circulation and removing phlegm\" could balance the levels of ET-1 and CGRP, which is one of the mechanisms of treating VaD. Nao Huan Dan capsule is a TCM formula developed by Huang et al (1998) according to the therapeutic principle \"supplementing qi and blood, activating blood circulation to remove obstruction in the channels\". In order to investigate the therapeutic effect of Nao Huan Dan capsule in treating mild and moderate patients of VaD, they recruited 45 cases of VaD that coincided with DSM-IV criteria and randomly allocated to TCM group (n=22) a nd western medicine group (n=23) for a three month treatment course. The rating scales used were MMSE and ADL. They found serum levels of estradio l (E2) and testosterone (T) were increased. Scores of MMSE and ADL were increased, E2 and T le vels were elevated and the ratio of E2/T was decreased in TCM group (p<0.01), as compared with western medicine group. The total therapeutic effective rate was 72.7 percent and 56.5 percent respectively. However, the difference be tween them was insignificant (p>0.05) (Huang et al., 2002). Yan et al (2001) observed the effect of Tongmai Yizhi capsule (TMYZC) on learning capability in VaD patients. Thirty pati ents with VaD were treated by oral 32administration of TMYZC. The change of MMSE and ADL were observed before and after the treatment. The total eff ective rate in the TMYZC group was 70.67 percent, while that in th e control group was 70 percent. The difference between the two groups was insignificant (p>0.05). Th ey concluded that TMYZC's action of \"supplementing qi and activating blood circulation\" was similar to hydergine's active rationale of dilating blood vessels, increas ing cerebral blood flow, lowering the hyper coagulative status and improving the free radical scavenging capability of patients . According to TCM, long lasting chronic disease damages the vital qi. VaD, developed from long term cerebrovascular di sease or multi ministrokes, is a typical TCM condition of qi deficiency. Qi, in failing to promote the blood circulation, will lead to blood stasis. All the above formulas were designed for both tonifying qi to address the root, and removing blood stasis to treat the superficial symptoms. Fuzheng Ditan Huayu translates as 'strengthening the body resistance, removing phlegm and blood stasis'. According to the therapeutic principle \"assisting the vital- qi, removing phlegm and blood stasis\", Luo Kang (2000) developed Fu Zheng Di Tan Hua Yu Formula ( Dang Shen, Huang Jing ,Shu Di Huang, He Suou Wu, Dan Shen, Chi Shao, Yu Jin, Yuan Zhi, Shi Chang Pu, Di Long, Jiang Can ), and used it to treat 68 of cases VaD in patients. 38 cas es received western medicine hydergine treatment as a control group. Outcome measur es used were clinical symptoms and MMSE. After two months treatment, the clinical symptoms and score of MMSE improved remarkably (P<0.01) in the TC M group, as compared with the western medicine group. 33Liu et al (1999) argued that VaD could not be tr eated or improved with commonly used herbal medicine and suggested applyi ng some herbal medicine with the action of \"removing pertinacious phlegm\", such as Meng Shi, Dan Shen, Ban Xia, Gua Lou et al., and some other herbal medicines with the action of \"removing blood stasis, regulating qi and nourishing blood\". Examples for those are Shui Zhi, Mang Chong, Dan Pi, Chi Shao, Xiang Fu etc. In TCM theory, 'all diseases are caused by phlegm'. 'Wind-phlegm' or 'obstinate phlegm', as one of the most common causes of VaD, has been paid attention by more and more clinicians. According to TC M, people over 60 years old will have the symptoms of liver and kidney yin-deficien cy. Yin, which is failure in controlling yang, results in hyperactivity of liver-y ang. The movement of liver-yang is transformed into internal-wind. Wind, with the characteristic of moving, brings the original phlegm to move upw ards and block the brain channels. The above formulas, while focusing on removing obstinate-phlegm, still employ some tonifying herbs to strengthen the body resistance. Kai Qiao Xing Nao Yi Zhi translates as 'awaking brain and benefiting intelligence'. Following the therapeutic principle of resu scitation and benefiting intelligence, Guan & Wu (2000) developed the formula ' Xing Shen Dan ' and used it in treating 100 cases of patients suffering from VaD. After comparing the MMSE and HDS score before and after treatment, they found the score improved remarkably after treatment (P<0.01). 34Liu et al (2000) used Yi Zhi Decoction, which has the f unction of resu scitation and benefiting intelligence to treat patients with VaD, and found that MMSE scores were increased 6.1 points on average, and hemorrh eological feature was improved as well. For those patients without obvi ous pattern identifications , some clinicians have developed formulas based on the general treatment principle of opening channel, awaking brain and benefiting intelligence, which have al so produced relatively good therapeutic effects. In summary, the most commonly used treatment principles in TCM for treating VaD are: Supplementing the kidney and strengt hening the brain, activating blood circulation Supplementing qi and activating blood circul ation, invigorating mental activity Strengthening the body resistance, removing phlegm and blood stasis Opening brain, resuscitation and benefiting intelligence These principles have led to the cons truction of specific formulae which claim benefit in treating VaD. 2.4 Treatment by Chinese Medicine Preparations 2.4.1 Standard Formulas Standard formulas are derived from anci ent TCM literature or standard textbooks, and have been considered a primary princi ple for managing all ki nds of disorders. 35The following are some examples where e ffectiveness in trea ting VaD has been stated in classical textbooks or ancient literature, and clinical trials hav e also been conducted to investigate their effectiveness. Table 2.2 Standard CHM formulas Formulations Functions Composition Buyang HuanWu Decoction Tonifying blood circulation and nourishing blood, strengthening spleen and draining damp Ma et al (1998) observed the effect of BuYang Huan Wu Decoction treatment on 60 cases of VaD, and compared this to 40 cases of VaD treated by western medicine. Results showed that the TCM group im proved intelligence remarkably over the control group (p<0.05). Wen (2002) used a modified BuYang Huan Wu Decoction to treat 27 cases of VaD in patients, and set up 24 cases of VaD patie nts who received western medicine as a control group. After treatment, they found that the overall effective rate in TCM group and the western medicine gr oup was 88.89 percent and 62.50 percent, respectively. The difference betw een them was significant (p<0.05). Dang Gui Shao Yao San Ji (2000) adopted \" Dang Gui Shao Yao San \" (Dang Gui, Bai Shao, Chuan Xiong, Fu Ling, Bai Zhi, Zie Xie ) to treat 37 cases of VaD in patients, and 31 patients were treated with western medicine as the contro l group. They found that the effective rate in TCM group was 86.49 percent, while that in the western medicine group was 58.06 percent - again, the difference between groups was sign ificant (p<0.01). Huan et al (1998) used the same formula in treating 36 cases of patients for two months, and found the overall effective rate was 63.8 percent. They concluded that \"Dang Gui Shao Yao San \" was an effective method in treating VaD caused by \"deficiency of essence and blood, phleg m and blood stasis blocking brain\". 37Quan & Li (2000) from Japan reported that they treated one cas e of acute VaD with \"Dang Gui Shao Yao San \". After treatment, not only the patient's memory capability improved, but also enabled the patient to return to work. Di Huang Yin Zi Wang (1999) used modified \" Di Huang Yin Zi \" to treat 34 cases of VaD in patients. HDS and MMSE were adopted as measuring scales. The results showed that the overall effective rate was 61.75 percent. Wu et al (2001) observed the clinical therapeu tic effect of modified \" Di Huang Yin Zi\" capsule treatment on VaD. 104 cases were randomly allocated into a TCM group and a western medicine group. After three m onths treatment, they found the effective rate of the treatment group and contro l group was 98.53 percent and 66.67 percent, respectively. The difference between them was significant (p<0.01). Liu Wei Di Huang Wan Zhang et al (2001) explored the effect of \" Liu Wei Di Huang Wan \" (Shu Di, Shao Yao, Shan Zhu Yu, Fu Ling, Huang Qi, Chang Pu ) treatment on 36 cases of VaD in patients. They found the overall effective rate was 80.6 percent and concluded that Liu Wei Di Huang Wan was an effective formula in treating VaD. Gu Han Yang Sheng Jing Yu (1995) treated 42 cases of VaD in patients with \" Gu Han Yang Sheng Jing \" and compared this with a western medicine gr oup. Results showed that the effective rates 38were 76.1 percent and 60.8 percent, resp ectively. The difference was significant (p<0.05) and no side effects were reported. Choto-san Choto-san (also Sanjiasan decoction in Ch inese medicine), a kampo (the Japanese adaptation of TCM) medicine, has been used for learning impairment associated with VaD in Japan. An interesting study, utiliz ing 'Choto-san', showed very interesting results for reducing the transient induced learning impairment after an ischemic event. Itoh et al (1999) investigated the efficacy of C hoto-san on VaD. Two different multicentric studies on the efficacy of Choto-san on patients with VaD were performed, one a well-controlled but non- double blinded study (60 patients) and another double blinded cont rolled study (139 patients). In the well controlled study, Choto-san was superior in the global improvement rating, utility rating and improvement in subjective symptoms, psychi atric symptoms and disturbance in daily living activities. In the double blinded study, with more objective criteria than the well controlled study, Choto-san was also superior in global improvement rating, utility rating and in improve ment of subjective symptoms , psychiatric symptoms and disturbance in daily living activites. Thes e results suggested that Choto-san is effective in the treatment of VaD. All the formulas discussed above have b een documented in textbooks and used for various conditions for many years. It is wort h noting that all thes e formulas were not specifically designed and indicated for Va D. Although clinical trials have been 39conducted for these formulas in treating VaD, scientific evidence from both clinical studies with rigorous methodological design an d experimental research is needed to validate or support their application for VaD. 2.4.2 Single-herb Recipe Although formulas or herb mixtures ar e the most commonly used methods for managing VaD, there are still some single herbs which have solo effects on VaD. These include, for example Panax ginseng , Ginkgo biloba, and other compounds such as Huperzine A extracted from Qian Ceng Ta which are are outlined below. Panax ginseng Ginseng, the root of Panax ginseng (C. A. Mey) , is another widely used herb to treat VaD. In Asia, ginseng has been used for many years as a stimulant and a tonic for qi ('life energy flow') deficiency, to treat st ress and physical or mental impairment, and to improve stamina. Ginseng is widely used in the US to increase energy and vitality, enhance physical performance, increase re sistance to stress and improve immune function. Several studies have repor ted that ginseng can mode stly improve thinking and learning (Lun et al, 2003; Sorenson & Sonne, 1996). A 12 month randomised controlled trial, evaluating a ginseng com pound for the treatment of VaD in China, found that average memory function was significantly improved in the ginseng treated patients (n = 25) (Jinzhou et al, 2003). However, a systematic review of randomised controlled trials evaluating ginseng for a va riety of uses, including enhancement of longevity, strength and wi sdom, and stimulation of the immune 40system, failed to establish its clinical effi cacy for any of these indications (Vogler et al., 1999). Ginseng root varies in quality, depending on the origin, age, site of cultivation, time of harvest and processing, and significan t variation can occur between the actual ginseng content in a product and the content stated on the label. The product may be manufactured differently, with different bra nds or variable ingredients. Side effects are relatively rare, although interactions with pharmaceutical drugs have been reported (see Table 2.1). Ginkgo biloba Although Ginkgo biloba has been used in China as a traditional medicine for a range of conditions, including asthma, bronchitis, heart dysfunction, for at least 5000 years, it was not until 1965 when Dr Schwabe introduced Ginkgo biloba into Germany, where it is now prescribed extensively for cerebral insufficiency. The diagnosis could cover a range of conditions includ ing memory and concentration problems, confusion, depression, anxi ety, dizziness, tinnitus and headache. Since then, especially during the last decade, there ha s been an explosive growth of studies conducted on both clinical trials and basi c studies to investigate the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba on VaD and /or the cognitive impairment associated with it. In 2000, Memory Centres of America Inc, New York conducted a 26-week analysis of a double blinded, placebo controlled trial of the Ginkgo biloba extract Egb 761 in dementia. This intent-to-treat (ITT) analys is was performed to provide a realistic image of the efficacy that could be expect ed after 26 weeks treatment with a 120 mg 41dose (40 mg t.i.d) of Egb 761. The data was collected during a 52 week, double blinded, placebo controlled, fixed dose, parallel group, multicentric study. Patients were mildly to severely impaired and diagnosed with uncomplicated Alzheimer's disease or multi infarct dementia accordi ng to ICD-10 and DSM-III-R criteria. The primary outcome measures included the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), Geriat ric Relative's Rating Instrument (GERRI) and Clinical Impre ssion of Change (C IC). From the 309 patients included in the ITT analysis, 244 patients (76% for placebo and 73% for Egb761) actually reached the 26th week visit. In comparis on to the baseline values, the placebo group showed a statistically si gnificant worsening in all domains of assessment, while the group receiving E gb761 was considered slightly improved on the cognitive assessment and the daily living and social behaviour. Mean treatment differences favoured Egb761 with 1.3 and 0.12 points, respectiv ely, on the ADAS- cog (p=0.04) and the GERRI (p=0.007). In the group receiving Egb761, 26 percent of the patients achieved at least a 4-point improvement on the ADAS-cog, compared to 17 percent with placebo (p=0.04). On the GERRI, 30 percent of the Egb761 group improved and 17 percent worsened, while the placebo group showed an opposite trend with 37 percent of patients wors ening for 25 percent improvement (p=0.006). Regarding safety, no differences betw een Egb761 and placebo were observed (Le Bars et al, 2000). A review conducted in 2002 by Birks et al (2003) showed that overall there was no significant difference between Ginkgo and placebo in the propor tion of participants experiencing adverse events. Cognition, acti vities of daily living and measures of mood and emotional function showed improvement with Ginkgo biloba (dose less 42than 200mg/day) compared with placebo at 12 weeks. But many of the early trials used unsatisfactory methods, were small and cannot exclude publication bias. Most studies report the analyses of data from participants who completed the treatment ; there were few attempts at ITT analyses. Birks et al conclude d that although there was promising evidence of improvement in cognition and functi on associated with Ginkgo , several modern trials showed inconsiste nt results. They suggested that there was a need for a large trial using m odern methodology and permitting an ITT analysis to provide robust estimates of the size and mechanism of any treatment effect. The multifactorial principle of action of Ginkgo biloba is characterized by rheological and blood-flow-promoting pr operties, protective effects against ischaemia and hypoxia, effects on nerve ce ll energy metabolism, antioedematous and myelin-protective effects, radical-scav enge activity, effect s on various cerebral transmitter and receptor systems. These action principles constitute the rati onale for clinical trials in vascular dementia. In clinical trials of di fferent working groups, effects of Ginkgo biloba on the cognitive performance, global function, and activities of the daily living have been found. Due to the clinical efficac y the World Health Organisation accepted Ginkgo biloba as an antidementive drug and added it in January 2000 into the AT C-Classification Index. Until now, ginkgo is the only herb accepted by western countries for enhancing memory and cognitive function. Despite th e encouraging findings, some researchers speculate that more high qua lity research, involving larg er numbers of people, is 43needed before ginkgo can be recommended as a memory enhancer to otherwise healthy adults. Huperzine A Huperzine A, a natural cholinesterase inhibitor isolated club moss ( Huperzia serrata-Qian Ceng Ta ), has recently been used for tr eating dementia in China and as a food supplement in the US. A number of clinical trials have been published (mainly in China), one of which demonstrated supe rior effectiveness of Huperzine A to the pharmaceutical drug piracetam in improving minor memory loss and age-related cognitive decline (Wadie, 2002). Another double blinded, placebo controlled trial also indicated that Huperz ine A could improve memor y, cognition, behaviour and function, compared to placebo group (Xu et al, 1999). Well designed human trials with Huperzine A have yet to be publish ed in the western medical literature. Table 2.3 summarises putative mechanisms of actions, possible adverse effects and interactions for these th ree herbal components. 44Table 2.3 Vascular dementia herbarium Herb Possible mechanism of action Adverse effects Interactions Ginkgo biloba Increasing blood circulation Inhibiting platelet- activating factors Modifying neurotransmitter system Reducing the density of oxygen free radicals Increasing acetylcholine synthesis and binding capacity of central muscarinic receptors Infrequent side- effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, weakness, restlessness, and skin rash.

May cause additive effects when used with other anticholinesterase agents, such as donepezil 2.5 Treatment by Chinese He rbal Medicine Injection Recently, with fast developing science and technologies being applied in the pharmaceutical manufacturing area, more and more herbs or herbal mixtures have 45been extracted or made into medicinal injections. These have not only largely facilitated improved application to patient s, but also increased the therapeutic effectiveness and accordingly reduced the therapeutic courses. Following on Table 2.4 lists the most common Chinese herbal medi cine injections used for the treatment of VaD. Table 2.4 Chinese herbal medicine injections for VaD CHM injection Functions Compositions Xing Nao Jing Injection Clearing heat toxin and opening brain, removing phlegm Gallbaldder stone of Injection Clearing heat toxin and opening brain Gallbaldder stone of Bos taurus domesticus (Niu Huang), Bubalus bubalis (Shui Niu Jiao), Lonicera japonica (Jin Yin Hua), Scutellaria baicalensis (Huang Qin) Mai Luo Ning Injection Clearing heat toxin and promoting blood circulation Scutellaria baicalensis(Huang Qin), Salvia miltiorrhiza (Dan Shen) etc SheXiang Injection Opening mind and awaking brain, promoting blood circulation Moschus berezovskii (Shexiang) etc Huang Qi & Dan Shen Injection Tonifying qi and promoting blood circulation Astragalus membranaceus (Huangqi), Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) 46Xing Nao Jing Injection Based on the classic formula \" An Gong Niu Huang Wan \", Xing Nao Jing injection has been widely applied in China for stroke and vascular dementia. Wang et al (2000) observed the therapeutic effect of Xing Nao Jing Injection treatment on vascular dementia and the affect on HDL a nd LDL. 76 cases of VaD in patients were randomly allocated into two groups: Xing Nao Jing Injection treatment group (n=39) and western medicine control group (n= 37). MMSE and content of HDL and LDL were assessed or observed before and af ter treatment. After 1-month treatment intervention, they found the scores of MMSE in the treatment group increased remarkably, as compared with the control group (p<0.05). The HDL elevated and LDL decreased in the treatment group (Wang et al, 2000). Qing Kai Ling Injection Cui Ling et al (1992) used Qing Kai Ling Injection ( Niu Huang, Shui Niu Jiao, Jin Yin Hua, Huang Qin etc) 40 ml/day to treat VaD pa tients for 1 month and compared the changes of HDS scores before and af ter treatment. Results showed that HDS scores increased remarkably after treatment (p<0.01). Mai Luo Ning Injection Zhao et al (1994) treated 36 cases of VaD patients with MLNI ( Huang Qin, Dan Shen etc) and found it to be effective after comparing the MMSE scores before and after treatment. They concluded that MLNI is an effective therapeutic method for treating VaD. 47She Xiang Injection Li et al (2000) conducted a clinical randomised controlled study on acupoint- injection for the treatment of VaD. 90 cases of VaD in patients were randomly allocated into three groups: SXI acupoint -injection group, SXI muscle-injection group and placebo control group. After six w eeks of treatment, the difference in improvement of intelligence between them was significant (p<0.05). They concluded that SXI was another effectiv e therapeutic method for VaD. Huang Qi and Dan Shen Injection According to the therapeutic principle \"supplementing qi and activating blood circulation\", Liu & Liu (2002) observed the c linical effect of Huang Qi Injection (supplementing qi) and Dan Shen Injection (activating bloo d circulation) treatment on VaD, compared with a western medicine group. After eight weeks treatment, the total effective rate of treatment group wa s 90 percent; much bette r than the control group (p<0.05). While more and more herbal medicine inject ions have been used clinically, attention should be paid to their increasing side effect s, such as allergies, impairment on liver or renal functions. Researchers suggest that more research on both pharmaceutic effects and herb-drug interactions is needed before they are considered as mainstream therapeutic treatments for VaD. 2.6 Treatment by Integration of TCM and Western Medicine Since the introduction of western medicine by Zhang Xichun in his Yi Xue Zhong Zhong can Xi Lu (1918-1934) to Ch ina in early 20th century, prevention and 48treatment of diseases with integrated TCM and western medicine is the invariable national healthy policy in China. In recent years, there has been an increase in the integration of TCM and western medici ne for the treatment of VaD in TCM hospitals, western medicine hos pitals and private clinics. Zhang et al. (2000) explored the therapeutic effect and mechanism of integrating of Ge Gen extract and western medicine treatment on patients with mild and moderate VaD. 68 VaD patients were randomly a llocated into two gr oups: 36 cases in a treatment group (integrated TCM and west ern medicine) and 32 cases in western medicine group. After comparing the HDS scores, it was found the difference of HDS scores between the two groups was si gnificant (p<0.01). They concluded that the integration of Ge Gen extract and western medicine has a better therapeutic effect than western medicine only. Yan et al (1996) also observed the effect of integration of TCM and western medicine treatment on VaD. The Chinese herbal formula \" Bu Shen Huo Xue Tang \" (Gen Shen, Chuan Xiong, Yuan Zhi, Tu Si Zi, Yi n Yang Huo, Gou Qi Zi, Nu Zhen Zi, Shan Yao, Dan Shen, Shou Wu ) and western medicine were used as a treatment group, and western medicine only was used as the control group. After two months of treatment, the effective rate of the two groups wa s 100% and 75%, respectively and the difference between them was significant (p<0.01). Although the nature of the interactions between these medicines is unclear, some evidence exists to support the integrative approach. In general western medicine is effective in relieving patient's symptoms . Herbal medicine, on the other hand, could 49adjust body immune function, increa se body resistance and balance ' yin' and 'yang '. This follows the TCM principle of ' Biao Ben Jian Zhi' , namely, addressing the root while treating the superficial symptoms of th e disease. Further st udies are required to better understand the mechanisms underlying these interactions. 2.7 Treatment with External Therapy and Others External therapy is defined as applying herbs externally. It is seldom applied in VaD treatment but can provide choices especially to patients who are unable to take medications internally due to various reasons. According to the principle of TCM external therapy, Li et al. (1998) designed \" Yi Zhi Xing Nao \" Cap, which was a combination of Ch inese herbs with the function of benefiting cognitive function, activating bl ood circulation and resuscitation. 100 patients with VaD were randomly allocated in to an external ther apy group (treated by \"Yi Zhi Xing Nao \" Cap) and a control group (treat ed by western medicine). After 30 days of treatment, the HDS score elevat ed significantly in the external therapy group in comparison with the control group. Th e total effective rate in the treatment group was higher than that in control group (p<0.01), indicating that this may be an alternative for treating VaD. 2.8 Other Complementary Medicine Therapies for VaD As discussed above , Chinese herbal medicines have been widely used for VaD or memory disorders. In addition to these, there are other th erapies (e.g, herbal medicines from other countri es or culture) which have been used for enhancing memory. The followings are some examples. 502.8.1 Bacopa monniera Bacopa monniera, an Ayurvedic herbal also known as 'brahmi', has been used for mental illness and cognitive enhancement. Animal studies have found Bacopa can enhance several aspects of me ntal function and learning ability (Singh & Dhawan , 1997). However, data from clinical studie s are inconsistent and controversial. A double blind, 12 week study found brahmi by th e Keen Mind, Central Drug Research Institute of India improved learning, memo ry, and other mental functions in human (Singh & Dhawan, 1982), while another double blind study with the same extract found no effects on mental function in hum an (Roodenrys S et al, 2002). To date, no significant side effects have been reported in the literature (N athan et al, 2001). 2.8.2 Vinpocetine Vinpocetine is a vinca alkalo id derived from the leaves of the Lesser Periwinkle (Vinca minor ). It is used as a treatment for me mory loss and mental impairment, and sold in Europe as a drug under the name Cavinton (Gedeon Richter Ltd, Hungary). Several double blinded studies have been conducted to evaluate vinpocetine for the treatment of dementia and related conditions , some of which demonstrated a positive outcome. For example, a 16 week, double blin d, placebo controlled trial of over 200 people with mild to moderate dementia found significant benefit in the vinpocetine treated patients as measur ed by 'global improvement' and cognitive performance scales (Hindmarch et al, 1991). However, a Cochrane review by Szatmari & Whitehouse failed to draw a conclusion on its clinical effectiveness (Szamari & Whitehouse, 2003). 512.8.3 Acupuncture Acupuncture is used to promote the flow of Qi around the body, and unblock the meridians to restore the body function. It has been recognised as a safe and potentially effective therapy by the World Health Organization (WHO) in treating a variety of conditions such as pain, na usea, stroke and alcohol dependence. Data from animal studies indicate that acupuncture could increase the ability of learning and memory and improve the functi on of red cell immunity in VaD rats (Mo et al, 2000). A clinical st udy conducted in China showed a significant improvement in immediate effect on VaD, compared wi th control group (Gao et al, 2001). The American National Alzheimer's Association also funded a pilot randomised clinical trial that suggested acupuncture might be beneficial for people with VaD (Emerson et al, 2001). However, the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of VaD needs to be established via a large multi centre trial following rigorous methodologies. 2.8.4 Nutritional medicine 2.8.4.1 B-group vitamins Vitamin B6 is involved in the metabolism of hom ocysteine, high levels of which are considered a risk factor for VaD. Vita min therapy with folic acid, alone or in combination with vitamin B6 and B12, has been reported to reduce plasma homocysteine levels (Borek C, 2003). Si milar results were found in another study which suggested B group vitamin supplemen tation may be appropriate for most dementia patients. However, a Cochrane review on Vitamin B6 for cognition found no evidence for short term benefit from vitamin B6 in improving mood or cognitive functions (Malouf et al, 2005). 52It has been suggested that deficiency of Vitamin B12 and folic acid might contribute to cognitive impairment. To dementia patients, vitamin B12 or folic acid supplementation may be appropriate. A number of studies have raised the quest ion that B12 or folic-acid supplementation may be useful to improve cognitive function in dementia patients. However, evidence of any efficacy of vitamin B12 in improving the cognitive function in people with dementia and lower serum B12 le vels remains insufficient at this stage (Malouf, 2005). 2.8.4.2 Vitamin E or Vitamin C The antioxidants vitamin E and vitamin C have been found to have a protective effect for vascular and mixed dementia, a nd improving cognitive function in late life (Anonymous, 2005; Masaki et al, 2000). A double blind tr ial found that 2000 IU of vitamin E per day for two years significan tly reduced dependency in people with dementia compared with placebo (Sa no et al, 1997). Side effects include gastrointestinal disturban ces, blurred vision, headache and fatigue, and it may have an additive interaction with antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents. 2.8.4.3 Fish oil Fish oil, a rich source of omega-3 fatty ac ids, is important for cognitive development, brain function and mood stabilising, and there is mounting evidence supporting its use in treating VaD. A study from the Fr ench Academy of Medicine found dietary omega-3 fatty acid plays a role in the pr evention of dementia (Bourre, 2005), and a recent review concluded that total omega-3 fatty acid and docosahexaenoic acid 53consumption were associated with a si gnificant reduction in the incidence of Alzheimer's and VaD, resulting in a sma ll improvement in scores on a dementia rating scale. In some studies, preparations with omega-3 to omega-6 ratios ranging from 1:4 produced significant effects on learning performance (MacLean et al., 2005). 2.8.5 Homoeopathy Homeopathy is a popular form of complement ary treatment, based on the principle of \"like should be cured with like\" (Vickers & Zollman, 1999). To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of homeopathic medicine used in treating dementia, a systematic review on randomised controll ed trials was conducted and found there were no studies that fulfilled the criteria for inclusion and no data to present. Therefore, in view of the absence of ev idence it is not possible to comment on the use of homeopathy in treating de mentia (McCarney et al, 2005). 2.8.6 Aromatherapy Aromatherapy is the therapeutic use of pl ant derived essential oils and is often applied in combination with massage. Arom atherapy has been used for people with dementia to reduce disturbed behaviour, promote sleep, and stimulate motivational behaviour (Thorgrimsen et al, 2005), and ther e is some evidence to support its use in dementia in general. Diffused lavender essential oil was found to have modest efficacy, reducing agitated behaviour in de mentia in a small single blind, placebo controlled trial (n = 30) (Holmes et al, 2002). However, a systematic review concluded that there were several methodolog ical difficulties in the existing data and well designed RCTs are needed (Thorgrimsen et al, 2005). 542.8.7 Music therapy Music therapy is the use of musical intervention to restore, maintain, and improve emotional, physical, physiological, and sp iritual health (Alzheimer's Society, London). One study of music therapy for demen tia indicated that it might be beneficial in treating the associated symp toms and improving the quality of life of people with dementia and their carers. Ho wever, the available evidence and the methodological quality of the studies is ge nerally too slight to draw any useful conclusion (Vink et al, 2004). 2.8.8 Physical therapies Physical therapies such as physiotherapy, chiropractic, refle xology (foot massage), remedial massage and therapeutic touch are believed to produ ce relaxation and to reduce stress and agitation. A lthough only limited and conflicting evidence exists for these therapies, their role s in dementia care should not be discounted (Wiles 2004). Melatonin , the hormone releas ed by the pineal gland, is c onsidered useful to manage sleep disturbance associated with dementia. Bright light therapy was found to help restless behaviour (Alzheimer's Society, n.d.). 2.9 Summary Over the last decade, complementary therap ies have been gaining popularity for the management of VaD, partially due to the limited availability of effective conventional therapies. To date, many precl inical and clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the mechanisms of ac tion, clinical effectiveness and efficacy of these therapies, the majority of which reported positive outcomes. Many of these 55studies, however, are either small, open la bel trials or carry serious methodological flaws. The best evidence so far comes from a number of well desi gned clinical trials of Ginkgo biloba, which demonstrate promising improve ment in cognition associated with VaD. It is noted that very few ther apies have shown speci fic effects on VaD, it is, therefore, appropriate a nd necessary that these therap ies be evaluated for their effectiveness on VaD using rigorous met hodologies. Further preclinical studies are also needed - particularly for herbal me dicine - to identify active components of herbs, and to establish their safety, pha rmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. The basic finding in this chapter is that th ere is currently no effective treatment to reverse the brain damage associated with dementia. Treatment is still largely based on the recognition and control of vascular ri sk factors. VaD, however, presents with a variety of symptoms from one individual to another and within the one individual from time to time. It would seem impossibl e, therefore, that one chemical compound or modality of treatment will ever be able to consistently achieve a favourable outcome in any individual suffering VaD, let alone the board spectrum of patients that present with this condition. Modern medicine has been relatively unsu ccessful at developing new and suitable approaches to VaD treatment. The drugs for the control of vascular risk factors are not listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for treatment of VaD in Australi a. This is because in general the drugs available for the management of cognitive problems in dementia are expensive and the outcomes are uncertain. Alternative medicine, such as herbs, acupuncture, vi tamin supplements, aromatherapy and other complementary therapies may be helpful to relieve certain symptoms. It is, however, 56appropriate and necessary that these therapie s be evaluated for their effectiveness on VaD using rigorous methodologies. 57________________________ CHAPTER III A Systematic Review of Clinical Tr ials of Chinese Herbal Medicine for Vascular Dementia ____________________________________________________________________ This chapter summarises the clinical trial literature from several aspects i ncluding therapeutic methods, diagnostic criteria, out come measures and other methodological issues. Methodological details including study design, randomisation, blinding, sample size, diagnostic criter ia, outcome measure, and tria l length were evaluated for all trials identified. 3.1 Introduction In recent years, there have b een an increasing number of clinical trials conducted to examine the use of Chinese herbal medici ne (CHM) for the treatment of vascular dementia (VaD). The majority of clinical tr ials in this field ha ve been performed in China and published in the Chinese literatu re. CHM has been used for the treatment of dementia for centuries. Many studies have suggested the potential effectiveness of CHM and acupuncture for the treatment of VaD (Le Bars et al , 2000; Zheng et al, 2000; Hu et al, 1998). Most of the studies, however, have failed to demonstrate methodological rigour or to report sufficient methodological detail to allow to adequate evaluation of the trial. The wea knesses in the studies remain, including publication bias, poor randomisation, lack of attention to blinding, poorly defined 58outcome measures, and weak statistical an alysis. This chapter reviews clinical evidence on CHM. 3.2 Methodology We searched, without language restricti on, for all publications between January 1996 and January 2007 using electronic databa ses MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Heal th Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, the China Bio-Medical Database (CBM-DISC) and the China Traditional Chinese Medicine Database System (CMCC). The search terms used were as follows: \"Chinese herbal medicine, herbs, traditional Chinese medicine\" FOR \"vascular dementia, multi-infract dementia , dementia, memory impairment\", AND \"clinical trial, RCTs, c linical study\". The reference lists of each primary study were hand-searched for additi onal publications. Further searches were performed by reviewing abstract booklets a nd review articles. E xperimental design, blind level, subject numbers and duration of the study were evaluated for all trials identified. The following key features summarised from \"The Revised Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement\" (Douglas et al 2001) were considered for evaluation of the literature (Table 3.1). 59Table 3.1 Key features of randomised co ntrolled Trials (summarised from the CONSORT Statement, 2001) Topic Description Title and abstract How participants were allocated to interventions Background Scientific background and explanation of rationale Participants Specification of the st udy population including justification of inclusion and excl usion criteria Interventions Details of the interventions for ea ch group and how and when they were administered Objectives A clear statement of specific objectives and hypotheses Outcome measures Clearly defined primary and s econdary outcome measures and methods for reliability and validity tests Sample size Justification of the sample size Randomisation Randomised design with full specificati on of the methods employed including generation of the random allocation sequence and blocking, allocation concealment, and implementation Blinding Blinding is essential an d double blinding mandatory for a drug study; how the success of blinding was evaluated Statistical methods Statistical analysis should matc h the study design; Intention-to- treat analysis Results Participants flow and number analysed Baseline demographic and clinic al characteristics of each group A summary of each primary and secondary outcome, effect size and precision (95% CI) Follow up Adverse events Discussion Interpretation of the results, taken into account study hypotheses, consideration of possible mechanism and explanation Limitations of the study Comparison with relevant finding from other studies Implications of the work General applicability 603.3 Results A total of 91 clinical trials conducted on VaD were identifie d. Out of these, 63 trials mentioned randomisation (including inco mplete and improper randomisation), and 12 of them were double blinded studies. The duration of the studies varied from three weeks to 52 weeks, with the majority be ing of eight weeks duration. The number of subjects of the studies ranged from 10 to 244. In 21% (19 of 91), there were over 100 subjects; the rest had less than 100 subjects. To qualify for inclusion, tr ials had to be randomised, double blind and placebo controlled. Meta-analysis was considered for individual parameters. However, the number of studies assessing a particular individual parameter was quite small, so it was decided the meta-analysis would not have added value to the report. Thirty two trials were excluded becaus e they were non-RCTs or the randomisation was incomplete or improper; 29 trials were excluded as not double blind; and 25 excluded because of non placebo control or other medicine used as control group whose effectiveness had not been evaluated by RCTs. Consequently, five trials were included for analysis. Data were separated into two categories: Ginkgo biloba and CHM formulation Jiannao Yizhi granule for VaD (Figure 3.1). 61 91 potentially relevant references screened 59 Abstracts for evaluation 30 Studies for full text review Figure 3.1 Flowchart of identified, excluded and included studies 32 excluded because they were non-RCTs or incomplete/improper randomisation 29 trials excluded as not double blind 5 Studies included in analysis 4 studies on Ginkgo biloba and published in English 1 study on CHM formulation and published in Chinese 25 studies excluded as non placebo control or other medicine used as control group whose effectiveness had not been evaluated by RCTs 623.3.1 Ginkgo biloba for VaD Although Ginkgo biloba has been used in China as a traditional medicine for a range of conditions, including asthma, bronchitis and heart dysfunction for at least 5000 years, it was not until 1965 when Dr Schwabe introduced Ginkgo biloba into Germany, where it is prescribed extensivel y for cerebral insufficiency. The diagnosis could cover a range of conditions includ ing memory and concentration problems, confusion, depression, anxi ety, dizziness, tinnitus and headache. Since then, especially during the last decade, there ha s been a growth of studies conducted, both clinical trials and basic studies , to investigate the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba on VaD and /or the cognitive impairment asso ciated with it. Four trials of Ginkgo biloba in management of VaD were included. In 1996, Haase et al conducted a place bo controlled, randomised, double blind clinical trial. 40 patients with a mean age of 68 (+/-12.5) years suffering from moderate dementia (Alzheimer, vascular, or mixed type) according to DSM-III-R criteria were included. Severity of the dis ease had to correspond to stages 4 or 5 of Reisberg's Global Deterioration Scale. In fusions of either EGb 761 or placebo were administered four days per week for four weeks. The primary outcome measure was the activities of daily living as assessed by the N\u00fcrnberger-Alters-Beobachtungsskala (NAB). The Clinical Global Impressions of change (CGI, Item 2) and the actual intelligence as assessed by the Kurztest f\u00fcr Allgemeine Intelligenz (KAI) were further target variables. No relevant group differences could be detected at baseline. After therapy, patients of th e active substance group scored significantly better (p < 0.05) on each outcome measure than those who received placebo. Using a sequential testing procedure, a globa l significance level of p < 0.05 could be assured. 63Superiority of EGb 761 therapy was also found with respect to a self rating scale for instrumental activities of daily living (N \u00fcrnberger-Alters-Alltagsaktivit\u00e4tenskala), the improvement of the most prominent symptom of illness, and the decrease of depression. Thus clinical efficacy of EGb 761 could be shown on three planes of assessment: the behavioural, the psychopathologic and the psychometric plane. It could be confirmed that, in patients with moderate dementia, short term intravenous infusion therapy with EGb 761 resulted in an improvement of psychopathology and cognitive performance, which is reflected in an increased ability to cope with the demands of daily living. The second study was conducted by Kanowski and his colleges in 1996. The efficacy of the Ginkgo biloba special extract EGb 761 in outpati ents with presenile and senile primary degenerative dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and multi infarct dementia (MID) according to DSM-III-R was investigated in a prospective, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multi centre study. After a four week run-in period, 216 patients were include d in the randomised 24 week treatment period. These received either a daily oral dose of 240 mg EGb 761 or placebo. In accordance with the recommended multi dimensional evaluation approach, three primary variables were chosen: the Clinic al Global Impressions (CGI Item 2) for psychopathological assessment, the Syndrom -Kurztest (SKT) for the assessment of the patient's attention and memory, and the Nurnberger Alters-Beobachtungsskala (NAB) for behavioral assessment of activi ties of daily life. Clinical efficacy was assessed by means of a responder analysis, with therapy response being defined as response in at least two of the three primary variables. The data from the 156 patients who completed the study in accordance with the study protocol were taken into 64account in the confirmatory analysis of valid cases. The frequency of therapy responders in the two treatment groups di ffered significantly in favour of EGb 761, with p < 0.005 in Fisher's Exact Test. Thus, the clinical efficacy of the Ginkgo biloba special extract EGb 761 in dementia of the Alzheimer type and multi-infarct dementia was confirmed. The investigationa l drug was found to be well tolerated. An intent-to-treat analysis of 205 patient s conducted on the above study in 2003 led to similar efficacy results (Kanowski, 1996). In a 24 week, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicenter trial, Van Dongen et al ( 2000) evaluated the efficacy, the dose dependence, and the durability of the effect of the Ginkgo biloba special extract EGb 761 (ginkgo) in older people with dementia or age-associated memory impairment. 214 participants with dementia (either Alzheimer's dementia or vascular dementia; mild to moderate degree) or age asso ciated memory impairment (AAMI) were recruited from 39 homes for the elderly. The participants were allocated randomly to treatment with EGb 761 (2 tablets per day, total dosage either 240 (high dose) or 160 (usual dose) mg/day or placebo (0 mg/d ). The total intervention period was 24 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment, the initial ginkgo users we re randomised once again to either continued ginkgo treatmen t or placebo treatment. Initial placebo use was prolonged after 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed after 12 and 24 weeks of intervention. Outcome measures include d neuropsychological testing (trail-making speed (NAI-ZVT-G), digit memory span (NAI-ZN-G), and verb al learning (NAI- WL), clinical assessment (presence and severity of geriatric symptoms (SCAG), depressive mood (GDS), self perceived hea lth and memory status (report marks), and behavioral assessment (self reported level of instrumental daily life activities). An 65intention-to-treat analysis showed no e ffect on each of the outcome measures for participants who were assigned to ginkgo (n = 79) compared with placebo (n = 44) for the entire 24 week period. After 12 weeks of treatment, the combined high dose and usual dose ginkgo groups (n = 166) performed slightly be tter with regard to self reported activ ities of daily life but slightly worse with regard to self perceived health status compared with the placebo group (n = 48). No beneficial effects of a higher dose or a prolonged duration of ginkgo treatment were found. Th ey could not detect any subgroup that benefited from ginkgo. Ginkgo use was also not associated with the occurrence of (serious) adverse events. The results of their trial suggest that ginkgo is not effective as a treatment for older people with mild to moderate dementia or age-associated memory impairment. Their results contrast sharply with thos e of previous ginkgo trials. An intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis was perfor med by Le Bars et al (2000) to provide a realistic image of the efficacy that could be expected after 26 w eeks treatment with a 120 mg dose (40 mg t.i.d.) of EGb 761. The data were collected during a 52 week, double blind, placebo controlled, fixed dos e, parallel group, multicenter study. Patients were mildly to severely impa ired and diagnosed with uncomplicated Alzheimer's disease or multi-infarct de mentia according to ICD-10 and DSM-III-R criteria. The primary outcome measures included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), Geriatric Evaluation by Relative's Rating Instrument (GERRI) and GCI. From 309 patients included in the ITT analysis, 244 patients (76% for placebo and 73% for EGb761) actually reached 66the 26th week visit. In co mparison to the baseline valu es, the placebo group showed a statistically significant worsening in all domains of assessment, while the group receiving EGb was considered slightly improved on the cognitive assessment and the daily living and social behavior. Mean tr eatment differences favored EGb 761 with 1.3 and 0.12 points, respectiv ely, on the ADAS-cog (p = 0.04) and the GERRI (p = 0.007). In the group receiving EGb 761, 26 percent of the patients achieved at least a four point improvement on the ADAS-cog, compared to 17 percent with placebo (p = 0.04). On the GERRI, 30 percent of the EGb 761 group improved and 17 percent worsened, while the placebo group showed an opposite trend with 37 percent of patients worsening for 25 percent impr oved (p = 0.006). Regarding safety, no differences between EGb 761 and placebo were observed. 3.3.2 A CHM Formulation Jiannao Yizhi Granule for VaD For more than 80 trials of CHM on VaD, only one trial matched the criteria of randomised, double blind and placebo controlled trial, although a few methodological problems remain with that study. In 2002, Zhang et al conducted a multicenter, double blinded randomised controlled trial to observe the effect of CHM in treating VaD. Two hundred and forty two patients with VaD of mild or middle degr ee were recruited, with 89 cases in CHM group, 106 in the western medicine group and 47 in placebo group. Mini-mental Status Examination (MMSE) and blesse d dementia scoring on TCM symptom classified evaluation were used to evalua te the therapeutic effect after 60 days treatment. Results showed that the total e ffective rate of Jia nnao Yizhi Granule was 58.4%, a better effect than that of the placebo group and western medicine group 67respectively. The treatment was superior in holistic regulat ion and systemic functional state improvement. They concluded that the effect of treatment of VaD by Jiannao Yizhi Granule is certa in and is worth of use. 3.4 Evaluation of CHM Trials on VaD 3.4.1 Diagnostic Criteria Accepted international diagnostic criteria, such as those outlined in Diagnosis and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorder, 4th version (DSM-IV), the International Statistics Classification of Disease, 10th version (ICD-10) and Hachinski Ischemia Score (HIS) etc, were used by most of the studies after 2000. Various problems existed in the earlier studies. Some of st udies used rating scales, such as the MMSE and Hasegawa's Dementia Scale (HDS) as di agnostic criteria, which lack specificity in diagnosing VaD, some used criteria de veloped by their own country or research centre and a few studies diagnosed and assessed patients using TCM clinical symptoms, without modern medicine diagnosis. Although most of these studies included Va D specifically in their design, some of them included patients with all types of dementia, and some included cognitive impairments associated with other cerebral vascular disease. A few studies diagnosed and assessed patients' clinical symp toms using TCM, without conventional diagnosis. This method is unsatisfactory from several points of vi ew. First of all, uniform grading criteria were not used and/ or not described. Hence their rating scales are invalidated or unpublished; secondly, they failed to differentiate VaD from AD; thirdly, it is not clear ho w the data were analysed. 68Some of the studies, especially the early Chinese studies, did not have explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and include patients with other mental illnesses, such as delirium, AD etc that could cause cogniti ve impairment. Recent studies were more selective in terms of the di agnosis criteria and applied the appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria. Very few studies exclude d patients with a history of alcoholism, patients taking medications such as antipsychot ics, neuroleptic, antidepressants, and anti-Parkinson's medications. 3.4.2 Dosage forms The most commonly adopted dosage forms of TCM formulas in the studies were, in descending order, capsule > water decocti on > granule > injecti on > extract > oral liquid. One third of TCM formulas were made into capsules for use in the clinical trials. While water decoction is considered as the most effective form of herbal medicine, there are stil l a lot of he rbalists preferring capsule form, as it is convenient to use and easily accepted by the majority of the patients. 3.4.3 Outcome measures The outcome measures used in these studie s were inconsistent. The majority of the studies accepted international outcome m easures, such as MMSE, HDS, ADL, and FAQ. The most frequently used outcom e measures were HDS and MMSE. ADL and FAQ were also often used, while ADAS-cog, which is well standardised and most useful measure for VaD, was used least. Some early studies used TCM clinical symptoms as rating scales, but did not report the details of classification or clinical symptoms. 693.4.4 Controls Only twelve of these 91 studies used pl acebo as control group. Sixty seven studies used western medicine or another herbal medicine mixture as control group, whose effectiveness hadn't been ev aluated by randomised controlled trials. In the studies (12 out of 91) with no control groups, eff ectiveness was evaluated by comparing pre- and post-treatment symptoms, which is not considered valid in a well designed clinical trial. 3.4.5 Clinical outcomes and publication bias Except for a couple of studies conduc ted in Japan and several studies on Ginkgo biloba published in English journals, the remainders were published in Chinese journals. A quarter of them were publishe d in national journals, the others were published in university, provinc ial or specialist journals. It is noteworthy that all but one of the trials reported positive results; especiall y those trials that used TCM clinical symptoms as diagnostic or assessment criter ia. This may be explained by 1) improper randomisa tion method, 2) lacking of or incomplete blinding, and 3) the existen ce of bias from either doctors and/or publishers. 3.4.6 Randomisation Randomised allocation is regarded as essent ial for validity of a trial. Authors should provide sufficient information in order for the reader to assess the methods used to generate the random allocation sequence and the likelihood of bias in group assignment. The method of randomisation was often inappropriately described. Although most of the studies mentione d randomisation, no detailed scientific 70randomised allocation method was actually described. There were two main randomisation errors f ound in these trials: 1. Misunderstanding of the word 'randomised': Chen et al (2002) described their group allocation method, 'randomly (Sui ji ) selected patients were allocated into two groups: with 11 8 in observation group and 30 in control group'. From this description, we are aware that although the word ' sui ji ' which means 'randomised' in Chinese is mentioned, it actually means randomly recruiting patients without bias, it does not mean randomised allocating of patients to groups. The latter is the exact meaning of 'randomisation': allocation by chance only. 2. 'Randomly matching' and 'randomisation': Some studies, for instance Zhang et al (2000) described their randomisation as, 'according to the principle of randomly matching, allocated patients in to three groups, with 110 in active herb group, 110 in western medicine group, and 50 in placebo group'. Their randomisation method is: every patient, w ho is allocated into one group, will be followed by the next patient entering in to another group. Thus, the number of patients in each group is always matched and balanced. Randomisation has a precise technical meaning. With random allocation, each participant has a known probability of receiving each treatment before one is assigned, but the actu al treatment is determined by a chance process and cannot be predicted. In these clinical trials, techniques of randomis ation based on a centralised computer system and/or block size were very seldom used. Zhang (2000) was the only Chinese publication to detail the study's computer created randomisation 71number list. Trials wit hout randomisation increase the risk of bias which could either introduce a false positive result or conceal a real effect. 3.4.7 Blinding Blinding is an important component of preven ting bias in a valid RCTs. It refers to keeping study participants, health care pr oviders, and sometimes those collecting and analysing clinical data unaware of the assi gned intervention, so that they will not be influenced by that knowledge. The asse ssment of outcome should be double blind, except in unusual circumstances, and it may be necessary to go to great lengths to achieve this. It is highly desirable to test the effectiveness of blinding measures when this can be done. The reason is that not only will the observers have been deceived by their own biases, but also the patients sometimes attempt to break the randomisation code. Only 14 percent (13 of 91) trials were double blinded design with five using incomplete blinding; the rest were singl e blinded or open labelled. The lack of double blinding and/or an incomplete blindi ng is a serious defect in these TCM clinical trials. 3.4.8 Sample Size Sample size is a key aspect to ensure a cl inical trial will produce an accurate result. Ideally, a study should be la rge enough to detect a stat istically significant and a clinically important difference (of an identifi able size) if such a difference exists. The size of effect deemed important is inversel y related to the sample size necessary to detect it; that is large samples are necessary to detect small differences. For s cientific 72and ethical reasons, the sample size for a tr ial needs to be planned carefully, with a balance between clinical and statistical c onsiderations. For these reason, it is very important that the author should indicate how the samp le size was determined (Douglas et al, 2001). By far the most serious defect in these cl inical trials is that only 16 out of 91 indicated their methods of power calculations , the majority of them made no mention of this at all. Few studies (7 of 91) ha d a sample size of over 200 subjects; 2 studies more than 300 subjects, and total of 21% ( 19 of 91) studies had more than 100 subjects. The rest had less than 100 subjec ts, with some even lower sample sizes (less than 40). These have significantly increased the risk of failing to detect a statistical difference. 3.4.9 Length of intervention Treatment course, sometimes crucial for obser ving effectiveness of herbs, is another aspect requiring greater atte ntion. Inadequate length of treatment may result in concealing a real effect. Excep t for Karger & Basel (2000) and Le Bars (1997) conducting a duration of 52 week s observation, most trials focused on short term or intermediate term rather long term outco mes. Some studies, such as Van Dongen (2000) and Kanowski (1996) had a 24 week treatment course. All the others were undertaken over a 10 or less than 10 week period. The sh ortest treatment duration was three weeks. 733.4.10 Side-effects Most studies have unintended and often unde sirable effects in addition to intended effects. Readers need information about the side effects as well as the benefits of interventions to make rational and balanced decisions. RCTs offer the best approach for providing safety data. However, monito ring of side effects in these trials was rarely documented nor were patients provide d with adequate information (3 out of 91). The severity and nature of side effects and the action to be taken in the event of occurrence were never reported. 3.4.11 Analysis The number of participants in each group is an essential element of the results and failure to include all participants may bias trial results. Most studies reported t he analysis of data from part icipants who completed the treatment. Very few studies attempted an ITT analysis, and sel dom reported data on compliance and completeness of follow up. In summary, although the outcomes of clinical trials conducted using TCM on VaD have been positive, it is difficult to accep t these findings because no strong scientific evidence to support CH M use is available. Many problems, such as publication bias, poor randomisation, lack of attention to blinding, poorly defined outcome measures, and weak statistical analysis were note d. The quality of TCM trials must be improved urgently. There is a need fo r a large trial using rigorous methodology including appropriate diagnosis and outcome measures, adequate sample size, long term observation and follow up together with an ITT analysis to allow for adequate evaluation on the size and mechanism of TC M treatment effects. Establishing and 74applying stronger clinical trial methodol ogies in TCM is imperative for its integration with modern medicine. Only then may TCM be adopted by western medical practitioners and impr ove options for patient care. 3.5 Discussion and Conclusion Five RCTs were analysed. The quality of studies was mixed, but some RCTs were rigorous. The four studies of Ginkgo biloba for VaD were of high quality. They are all placebo controlled trials with adequate randomisati on and blinding. Except for the study conducted by Hasse (1996), the three studies (Kanowski 1996; Van Dongen, 2000; and Le Bars, 2000) all recruited more than 200 participants and with over 24 weeks treatment duration. DSM-III-R and /o r ICD-10 were used consistently as diagnostic criteria in the f our trials. CGI was adopted as outcome measure by all the four studies. Le Bars et al (2000) was th e only one to use ADAS-cog as an outcome measure, which is considered standard and widely used in western medicine clinical trials. ITT analysis was employed in three studies (Kanowski 1996; Van Dongen, 2000; and Le Bars, 2000). Although there was promising evidence of improvement in cognition and function associated with ginkgo, the results were inconsistent. Three studies (Hasse 1996; Kanowski 1996; and Le Bars, 2000) stated confirmed improvement of cognitive performance as measured by outcome meas ure. However, Van Dongen's results contrasted sharply with other studies a nd did not support the view that ginkgo is beneficial for patients with dementia or age-associated memory impairment. A Cochrane review conducted by Bi rks et al. (2002 and updated 2007) also showed that many of the early trials used unsatisfactory methods , were small with no ITT 75analysis, and cannot exclude publication bias . They concluded that the evidence that ginkgo has predictable and clinically signifi cant benefit for people with dementia or cognitive impairment is in consistent and unconvincing. The study conducted by Zhang et al (2002) was one of the few TCM trials using accepted methodology of RCTs. However, well standardised and widely used outcome measures, and scien tific statistical analytic al method permitting an ITT analysis are needed. Available evidence so far is neit her strong nor consistent that Ginkgo biloba or CHM causes systematic changes in cognitive function and activity of daily living associated with VaD. The current eviden ce for the use of CHM is limited and does not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn. There is a need for large rigorous trials to provide robust estimates of the size of any treatment effect. 76_________________________ CHAPTER IV Wei Nao Kang - a CHM Formulation for VaD 4.1 Background Wei Nao Kang (WNK) is a three herb formula (combining Ginkgo biloba L, Panax Ginseng C A Mey, and Crocus sativus L) developed through extractions, fractionation and screening processes by th e Pharmacology and Experimental Centre at Xi Yuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. A series of preclinical animal studies has been conducted by the research team at Xi Yuan Hospital to evaluate the ideal relativ e concentration of the three herbs, the dosage regimens, pharmacodynamics, and acute toxicity of the formula. The main findings are summarized as follows: 4.2 Indications, Rationale and Dosage 4.2.1 Indications Vascular dementia, recovery period of ischemic stroke 4.2.2 Rationale from TCM Viewpoint According to the TCM theory, VaD is clos ely related to Brain, Heart, Spleen and Kidney, and its main pathological feature is Qi deficiency with Blood stasis blocking Brain and Channels (Li, 2002). 77Ginseng, a commonly used Chinese herb for deficiency disorders in TCM, has the functions of tonifying essential Qi, stre ngthing Spleen and Lung, tranquillising Spirit and benefiting intelligence (WHO Geneva, 1999). Yinxingye, the leaf of Ginkgo biloba L ., has the functions of astringing Lung, soothing asthma, enhancing memory and re living pain and has been applied for a range of conditions, such as asthma, bronchitis, memory disorders and heart dysfunction for centuries (Zhang, 1992). The extracts of Ginkgo biloba have been used for symptomatic treatments of mild to moderate cerebrovascular insufficiency (dementia syndromes in primary degenera tive dementia, vascular dementia, and mixed form of both) with the following sy mptoms: memory deficit, disturbance in concentration, depression emotional condi tion, dizziness, tinnitus and headache (WHO Geneva, 1999). Xihonghua , the stigma of Crocus sativus L ., has the strong functions of promoting blood circlation, removing Blood stasis an d unblocking Channels. Its clinical indications include coronary disease, thrombotic disease, and menstrual disturbance (Zhang, 1992). Together, these three herbs in the formul a work in a complementary fashion in addressing the fundamental pathological abnormalities associated with VaD through tonifying essential Qi, promoting Bl ood circulation, removing Blood stasis, unblocking Channels, benefiting intellig ence and enhancing memory ability. 4.2.3 Dosage 60 mg of actives in each capsule; one capsule, three times daily 784.2.4 Manufacturer Tianjin Zhongxin Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd. No.330, Zhongshan Road, Herbei District, Tianjin, China (License No: D1903) 4.2.5 List of Ingredients Chinese Name Scientific Name Ren Shen Panax ginseng C.A. Mey, root Ying Xing Ye Ginkgo biloba L., leaf Xi Hong Hua Crocus sativus L., stigma 4.3 Chemical and Safety Profiles of the Herbs All herbs used in this trial are listed with the Federal Government's Therapeutic Goods Administration and have such been acknowledged as suitable for human consumption. All herbs are currently av ailable over the count to the public throughout Australia and are classified as food products and he rb starting products. They are all to be administered well within standard dosage levels . No herb used in this trial is a controlled substance, animal product or endangered species. 4.3.1 REN SHEN - Panax ginseng C.A. Mey, root Chemical profile : The root of Panax ginseng C.A. Mey contains Panaxosides (I-VI), essential oils (0.05%, and the main chemical constituents are panacene and panaxynol), amino acids, panose A-D, and Vitamin B 1, B2. 79Contraindications : Incompatible with Rhizoma et Radix Veratri. It should not be prescribed in cases of excess syndrome and heat syndrome without deficiency of the vital Qi. Adverse effects : Mild irritability and excitation were observed in persons who took 100 ml of 3% ginseng tincture. Two hunderd ml of the tincture or large doses of ginseng powder could result in intoxicat ion including pruritus, headache, vertigo, hyperpyrexia and bleeding. Over dosage of ginseng could result in breathlessness, chest discomfort and abdominal distention. Prolonged oral use of more than 0.3 g of ginseng powder might lead to insommia, depression, headache, palpitation, hypertension, diminished sexual function and we ight loss. Radish has been used as a folk remedy for treati ng ginseng intoxication. Toxicity : The LD50 of the oral administra tion of the powdered root of Panax ginseng in mouse was higher than 5g/kg. The acute LD50 of substaneous ginseng extract in mouse was 16.5ml/kg. After or al administration of 100, 250 and 500mg/kg of ginseng for a month, the subacute toxici ty tests showed no abnormality. The acute LD50 of the various fractions of ginseng or its ginsenosides by intraperitoneal injection in mouse showed that Rf and Rg1 which contained panaxatriol, and Rb1 which contained panaxadiol and glucose as it s sugar moiety are less toxic. (Chinese pharmacopoeia, 2005). 4.3.2. YIN XING YE - Ginkgo biloba L., leaf Chemical profile : The leaf of Ginkgo biloba L. J were also found. Adverse effects : ginkgo preparation has mild side effects. Occasional dizziness, headache lassitude, xerostomia, dry and red tongue, chest discomfort, gastric discomfort, loss of appetite, abdominal distension, constipation, or diarrhoea may occur. Howerver, in general these advers e effects do not affect the completion of treatment. Toxicity : Daily injection of ginkgo extracts to dogs at doses 10 or 40 times the human dose for one week produced gastroin testinal symptoms including salivation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and impaired appetite. Histological examination revealed hypersecretion of the small intestinal mucosa. Local injection of this a gent may cause vascular sclerosis, inflam mation and organised thrombosis, but no abnormalities were observed in the blood picture and liver function tests. The flavones of Ginkgo biloba L did not cause any morphologi cal changes in the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and arteries during subacute experiments on rabbits, guinea pig, rats, and mice. (Chinese pharmacopoeia, 2005) 4.3.3. XI HONG HUA - Crocus sativus L., Stigma Chemical profile : The stigma of Crocus sativus L. contains crocin 1- 4, trans - cis dimethyl 81Contraindications : this herb is contraindicated in pregnant woman. Furthermore, it should be used with caution in patients with peptic ulcer or haemorrhagic diseases. Adverse effects : In general, there are no significant adverse reactions associated with this herb, but a minority of patients may develop dizziness, skin eruptions and transient urticaria. In treatment of verruca plana, transient a ggravation of local lesions may occur in some patients, which usually disappears quite rapidly. Attention must be drawn to the incidence of a slight increase in menstrual flow in some woman after medication. Toxicity : the MLD of the herb decoction in mice by intraperitoneal injection was about 1.2 g/kg. The LD50 of the alcohol extracts by intravenous injection in mice was determined to be 5.3g/ kg. The LD50 of carthamin in mice by intravenous injection was 2.35 \u00b10.14g/kg, whereas its safety dose by mouth was >8g/kg. The 50% tinctorius flower injection inst illed into the eyes was not irritating to the conjunctiva. The drug had no haemolytic action in vitro . No toxic effect or death was observed in mice given the intraperitoneal injection at the dose of 12.5g/kg for two days. Young rats given feeds with carthamin, 0.015-1.5g/ kg every day by mouth for 3 months, did not show significant changes in the blood pi cture, liver and kidney functions, nor any morphological abnormalities in the heart, liver, kidneys, and gast rointestinal tract (Chinese pharmacopoeia, 2005). 824.4 Preparations of WNK and Placebo and Quality Assurance 4.4.1 WNK and Placebo Preparation The Research Centre, Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences developed the formula for WNK and the placebo. Tianjin Zhongxin Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd., a pharmaceuti cal manufacturer in China with an Australian GMP licence, prepared the tr ial medications. The placebo was prepared and designed to taste, smell and look as same as the CHM formulation. WNK : three raw herbs were cut into pieces an d then extracted with dilute ethanol solution respectively followed by a concentra tion process in a vacuum to a smaller volume. It was then purified with resin, and concentrated into dry powder. These three dry powders were then mixed together with starch to form the active medicine of WNK. Placebo : the composition of the placebo contains mix starch (as basic material), sunset yellow 85020, tartrazine 60, dry carro t powder, denatonium benzoate, powder flavour and burnt sugar colour. WNK and the placebo were in the form of capsules pre-packaged in blister packs each containing 60 mg of the actives. The dos age of the WNK was one capsule, three times daily by oral administration in the clinical trial. 4.4.2 Quality Assurance of WNK All herbs were made into dried powder form and encapsulated fully complying with the Australian Good Manufacturing Practice (G MP) conditions to ensure the quality 83of the herbal formula in terms of its hea vy metal content, pesticides and microbial contamination. The relevant biomarkers were chosen from WNK formula for the quality control purpose. They include total ginsenosides, total flavonoides, crocins, total flavonol glycosides, total internal gins enoside Rg1, ginsenoside Re and crocin-I). The quantities of these markers were monito red using HPCL and TLC methods during the manufacturing processes guided by the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (2005 edition). 4.5 Preclinical Studies of WNK 4.5.1 Extracts and Dosage Screening 4.5.1.1 Screening of Ginkgo biloba extracts The effectiveness of three different Ginkgo biloba extracts (extracts I, II, and III) was assessed in the study using water maze and de collation models in mice. Only Extract II treatment (20 mg/kg i.g. x 8 and 9 days) si gnificantly decreased th e latencies of the mice in the water maze study. In the decollation experiments, the respiration retention time was only prolonged significantly in the animals treated with Extract II (20 mg/kg i.g. x 3 days). Extract II was, therefore, chosen to be the ginkgo extract for the formula. 4.5.1.2 Screening of dosage regimens for the formula Different dosage regimens of the three herbal extracts were evaluated in the local cerebral ischemia and Morris water maze models in mice. The importance of the 84herbal extracts in the formula was found to be: Panax ginseng > Ginkgo biloba > Crocus sativus . The ideal ratio of the three herb al extracts for the formula is 5 (Ginseng extract): 5 (Ginkgo extract): 1 (S affron extract). The ideal dose of the formula is 22 mg/kg. 4.5.2 Pharmacodynamic study 4.5.2.1 can create dysmnesia via decreasing the acetylcholine (ACh) concentration in brain tissues. Afte r scopolamine treatment, the animals demonstrated an increase in 5 min error num bers and a decrease in latencies in the Jumping Stand Autocontrol Apparatus (JSAA). Weinaokang treatments (22 and 44 mg/kg, i.g. x 14 days) significantly reduc ed the error numbers and markedly prolonged the latencies in the mice with th e acquired dysmnesia. It was concluded that Weinaokang improved the acquired dysmnesia induced by scopolamine in mice. 4.5.2.2 Effect of Weinaokang on reserpine induced dysmnesia Reserpine can exhaust the monoamines and th erefore impair the function of learning and memory. In the animals receiving reserpine treatment, the error numbers were significantly increased and the latenc ies were decreased in the JSAA study. Weinaokang treatment (22 and 44 mg/kg, i .g. x 14 days) significantly reduced the error numbers. However, the latencies remained unaltered after the treatment. The results indicate that Weinaokang could impr ove the reserpine induced memory defect in mice. 854.5.2.3 Effects of Weinaokang on sodi um nitrite induced dysmnesia nitrite the haemogl obin resulting in hypoxia and ischemia in brain tissues, which in turn impair the le arning and memory function. Sodium nitrite treatment in mice significantly increased the error numbers and decreased the latencies in the JSAA study. In the animals receiving Weinaokang treatment (44 mg/kg, i.g. x 14 days), the error numbers were decreased significantly whereas the latencies were markedly prolonged. It wa s concluded that Weinaokang improved the impairment of learning and memory func tion induced by sodium nitrite in mice. 4.5.2.4 Effects of Weinaokang on ischemia induced by bilateral common carotid artery ligation Carotid artery ligation can create brain is chemia that leads to atrophy, degeneration and loss of the neurons responsible for lear ning and memory in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Compared with a sham operation group, the rats with carotid artery ligation demonstrated prolonged latencies to find the terminal platform in Morris water maze, decreased ACh concentrat ion in the brain tissues and increased plasma endorphin concentration. All We inaokang treatments (30 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg, i.g. x 60 days) significantly shortened the latencies in Morris water maze and increased ACh concentrations in brain tissues. The plasma endorphin concentration was also decreased signifi cantly in the animals receiving 30 mg/kg of Weinaokang. The results demonstrated that Weinaokang treatment reversed the biochemistry and behaviour changes induc ed by the brain ischemia in rats and therefore may be effective for the treatment of vascular dementia. 4.5.2.5 Effects of Weinaokang on brain inju reperfusion and D-galactose i.p. injection 86Ischemia reperfusion procedure (via clip ping the common carotid arteries for 20 mins) in conjunction with D-galactose i.p. injection produced cognitive handicap and dysfunction of learning and memory in mice evidenced by an increase in the latencies, the total length and the search strategy score (the higher the worse) in Morris water maze study and a decrease in su peroxide dismutase (SOD) activities. Weinaokang treatment (44 and 22 mg/kg, i.g. x 8 weeks) significantly decreased the latencies, the total length, and the search strategy score. The SOD activi ties were also markedly improved by these treatments. It was concluded that Weinaokang treatment improved the ischemic brain injuries in the mice model and therefore, could be beneficial for the treatment of vascular dementia. 87 PART TWO THE TREATMENT OF VASCULAR DEMENTIA WITH CHINESE HERBAL MEDI CINE: A RANDOMISED PLACEBO CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL 88_____________ CHAPTER V Chinese Herbal Medicine for Va scular Dementia: a Randomised Placebo Controlled Trial Methodology ______________________________ ____________________________ This chapter addresses all the methodological issues in terms of study design, recruitment, inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomisa tion, blinding, sample size calculation, data collection and analysis, relevant to a clinical trial undertaken as part of this study. The methodology not only fu lly complies with the International Committee of Harmonisation (IC H) guidelines on Good Clin ical Practice (GCP), but also accommodates lessons learnt from the review of the trials on VaD. 5.1 Introduction Currently, there is no effective treatment to reverse the brain damage associated with dementia. Treatment is still largely based on the recognition and control of vascular risk factors. However, currently used drugs are not on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) listing for treatment of VaD in Australia. In general the drugs available for the management of cognitive problems in dementia are expensive and the outcomes are uncertain. Only a limited nu mber of studies that showed VaD might be improved with donezepil (Wilkinson et al, 2003) and memantine (Wilcock et al, 2002). It is therefore important to seek out alternative approaches, which may prove cheaper and safer. 89Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been used for the treatment of dementia like disorders for centuries. Data from many pr eclinical studies and some preliminary clinical studies have suggested the potential effectiveness of CHM and acupuncture for treatment of VaD. However, most of the studies were published in the Chinese literature and failed to demonstrate met hodological rigour or to report sufficient methodological details. Weaknesses in th e studies include publication bias, poor randomization, lack of atten tion to blinding, poorly defi ned outcome measures, and weak statistics analysis. Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) using scientific methods of diagnosis and outcome measures are urgently needed. These trials require an adequate sample size, long term observation and follow up, together with an Intention-To-Treat (ITT) analysis to allow for adequate evaluation of the sample siz e and clinical effectiven ess (Tang et al, 2001). Wei Nao Kang (WNK) is a three herb formula developed by Xi Yuan Hospital, Beijing, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Preclinical experiments of WNK (combining Ginkgo biloba L, Panax Ginseng C A Mey, and Crocus sativus L) have demonstrated statistically signifi cant improvement in learning and memory function in dementia animal models in ra ts and mice. This se ries of preclinical animal studies also evaluated the ideal rela tive concentration of the three herbs, ideal dosage and acute toxicity of the formula. Ac ute toxicity tests have been performed in mice with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the formula of 1.71 g/kg. Human case studies have signalled the potential value of this herbal formula in early and moderate VaD, and it appears to offer a neuroprotective effect in general dementia. Although the results of these studies were encouraging, strong scientific evidence from well designed RCTs is still lacking. 90The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the Chinese herbal formula WNK for the treatment of Va D in a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial. It was hypothesised that: 1. patients treated with WNK will show greater improvement in cognitive functions 2. patients treated with WNK will show great er improvement in activities of daily living 3. patients treated with WNK will show greater improvement in health subscales of the SF-36 health survey 4. patients treated with WNK will show great er improvement in cerebral blood flow (CBF) To the best of our knowle dge, this is the first clinical trial of CHM for VaD conducted outside China following a well de signed clinical trial methodology, which addressed a number of the concerns raised by the review on VaD clinical trials (see Chapter 3) and by other authors. This RCT will contribute to the scientific evidence for WNK as an alternative treatment for Va D. If WNK is proven to be effective, it may provide a safe alternative for the ma nagement of VaD, support the evidence based practice of TCM, and help to relieve the substantial burden of the disorder to the Australian community. 915.2 Objectives of the trial Primary objective To evaluate the efficacy of WNK on cogni tive function in the management of VaD, as measured by ADAS-cog Secondary objectives : To investigate the efficacy of WNK on quality of life and activities of daily living in VaD patients To investigate the efficacy of WNK on the brain blood flow in VaD patients To monitor the safety of WNK in VaD patients 5.3 Study design This study was a 16 week randomised, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial. The trial was conducted in full compliance with the ICH guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the Australia Ther apeutic Goods Administration (TGA) guidelines for clinical trials. A Clinical Trial Notification (C TN) was lodged with the TGA. 5.4 Recruitment The clinical trial was approved by both th e University of Western Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (approval No: 04/061) and Sydney South Western Area Health Service Human Ethics Committee (approval No: 04/057). 92Potential participants were recruited from the Aged Care Outpatient Clinics and the Memory Disorder Clinics at Bankstown Hosp ital and selected specialist clinics. Specialists who agree to be involved in th e project were given an advertising poster to hang in their clinic. This poster advertis ed the trial and suggested that interested patients ask their doctor for more inform ation. The poster also provided the trial coordinator's contact details. Advertising of the study occurred by seve ral methods. It was circulated on the electronic notice boards of University of Western Sydney (UWS ) and South Western Sydney Area Health Service (SWSAHS), and local newspapers once every fortnight for the initial two months of the trial (see Appendix 1). 5.5 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria Age 60 and above A diagnosis of probable or possible VaD or mixed Va D and Alzheimer's disease of more than or equal to 3 months dur ation based on the NINDS-AIREN criteria (see Appendix 2) Hachinski Ischemic Score (HIS) 4 would be used to distinguish VaD from other types of dementia (see Appendix 3) Absence of severe depression (Geria tric Depression Rating Scale 15-item version, total score<11, s ee Appendix 4). Patients with mild depression who are stable on antidepressant medication Patients on cholinesterase inhibitors if there has been no significant cl inical improvement over the last 3 months 93 Patients who have hypertension, diabetes, car diac disease or stroke where these disorders have been stable or controll ed by medication for at least 3 months. Exclusion criteria Patients with other types of dementia, delirium, schizophrenia, acute illness or poorly controlled chronic diseases Administration of drugs that can affect cognitive function including Ginkgo biloba , psychotropic drugs, hypnosedatives. Administration of drugs such as warf arin that can have significant drug interactions with the herbs in the formula Significant liver or renal disease. Inability to understand informed consent or give consent Severe dysphasia Mental retardation Life expectancy of less than 6 months 5.6 Randomisation A statistician generated balanced randomis ation with no access to information on the patients and investigator. The randomisati on code was developed using a computer random number generator to select random permuted blocks. Blocking was used to ensure a close balance of the numbers in each group at any time during the trial. The blocking length was 4, 8, and 10 randomly. Th is code was given to a research program coordinator who assigned participan ts to the trial group. The code was also held by a third party in confid ence and was not revealed until completion of the trial. 94Once the patients had been recruited, they were randomly allocated to receive the active WNK or placebo treatment by means of a computer randomisation package. Randomisation occurred as close to the co mmencement of treatment as possible and the next treatment to be allocated was not identified before the patient was entered into the trial. Participants and investigati ng staff were blinded to treatment allocation until the end of the trial when the coding was unlocked. Only the study statisticians and the data monitoring committee saw unblinded data, but none had any contact with study participants. 5.7 Blinding All study participants and i nvestigating staff were blinded to treatment allocation until the end of the trial when the coding was unlocked (Timo E, 1996; Chiu, 2000; Khaled & Gordon, 1996). Independent pharmacists from the Bankstown Hospital Pharmacy Department dispensed either WNK or placebo according to a computer generated randomization list. The success of blinding was assessed on co mpletion of the trial. Each subject was asked what treatment they believed they had received (WNK , placebo, or don't know) and what lead them to that assumption. If blinding was successful, the ability of subjects to accurately guess their trea tment allocation should be no better than chance (Altman et al, 2001). 5.8 Treatment Procedure 5.8.1 Screening 95At the first appointment, poten tial participants were give n an Participant Information Statement and Consent Form. The Participant Information Statement explained the objective of the trial and its relevance a nd importance to them selves and to the medical community. The trial methodology, poten tial risks and what was expected of participants was also outlined. Participants were asked to read the Participan t Information Statement (Appendix 5) and si gn the Consent Form (Appendix 6) to indicate their intention to pa rticipate in the study. The pa rticipant retained a copy of the documents, and another was kept on file with the chief investigator. Once the consent form had been signed, the particip ant was registered into the trial (see Appendix 7) and an appointment was a rranged for additional screening and a medical check-up. The participants were also required to do a bl ood test to further check their eligibilities, and encouraged to do 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT scan for a cerebral perfusion study. 96Table 5.1 Procedure and data handling Week -4 (Screening)Week 0 (Baseline)Week 4 (First visit) Week 8 (Second visit) Week 12 (Third visit) Week 16 (End of treatment )Week 32 (Follow up) Due Date Information Statement Consent form Registration Form Inclusion/exclusion criteria NINDS-AIREN HIS GDS FBC+Biochemistry Panel ADCS-ADL MMSE SF-36 Safety monitor report Medical clinician review Research officer review 975.8.2 Assessments Assessments were conducted at baseline, at 2 months and 4 mont hs by geriatricians, neuropsychologists or the chie f investigating staff, who we re trained to standardise their assessment scales including Alzheme r's Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive sub-scale (ADAS-cog, see Appendix 8), Mini-Mental State Examination 9) and Alzheimer's Disease Co-operative Study-Ac tivities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL, see Appendix 10). The SF-36 health survey (see Appendix 11) was also completed by patients or investigator at baseline and Week 16. Assessments were done at the same time of day. Safety checks and blood tests were conducted on every participant visit, along with adverse events. After receiving treatments, participants were required to visit their doctors and investigators at the clinical trial centre at Bankstown Hospital. Overall t hree clinical assessments were scheduled during the f our month treatment period. Four months after the treatment has completed, participants were required to come back for followup. Follow up and assessment questionnaires were completed after each treatment period. 5.8.3 Missed Appointments A missed appointment was followed up on the day of scheduling. Another appointment was made within two days of the original time. If the participant was unable to make arrangements for the resche duled appointment, the chief investigator attempted to make a home visit. Participants were asked to give at least a day notice if they could not attend an appointment. 98Participants were asked to notify the chief inve stigator if they were to be away for an extended time. A consultation was scheduled to dispense sufficient medication for the remainder of the time until the next visit. A follow up phone call was made on their return to ensure no adverse effects had been noted and that he or she has complied with the trial protocol. Concom itant medication users were questioned about the use of new medications or change s in the use of current medications at each visit and these were recorded on the follow up form. Medications specifically listed in the exclusion criteria were not allowed during the trial. 5.8.4 Withdrawal Policy Participants were required to withdr aw if any of the following happened: Unacceptable adverse event Non compliance with therapy Consent withdraw Missed followup Participants who wished to withdraw during the initial course of treatment due to perceived lack of benefit were encouraged to complete the study. Participants who withdrew from the study were not replaced. 5.9 Safety Monitoring and Reporting All the adverse events suspected to be re lated to treatment, such as headache, dizziness, vomiting, allergy etc and any worsening of symptoms were closely monitored. Impaired liver or renal func tion and haematological changes (eg. haemoglobin (HB), white cell (WC), and platelets etc) were recorded in the safety 99monitoring report form (see Appendix 12). Reco rding of intensity of adverse events are as follows. None: Mild: did not interfere with the patient's daily activities Moderate: some interference with daily activities Severe: interfered significantly with da ily activities or abnormal laboratory result Death An assessment of the relationship between the adverse event and the treatment was made. An adverse event was followed up until it resolved or for up to a month after the study had concluded. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an adverse event occurring during any study phase and at any dose of the investigati onal product, comparator or placebo that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: Results in death; Is immediately life-threatening; Requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existin g hospitalisation; Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect; Is an important medical event that ma y jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 100The causality of SAEs (ie their relations hip to study treatment) was assessed by the investigator(s), who in completing the releva nt case report form must answer 'yes' or 'no' to the question 'Do you consider that th ere is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the treatment?'. SAEs were immedi ately reported to the SWSAHS and UWS Human Re search Ethics Committees. 5.10 Labelling and storage of trial medications 5.10.1 Labelling All study medications bore a label displaying the following information: Name of manufacturer Name of subject Randomisation number/trial reference code Dosage Instructions Expiry date The statement \" For clinical trial use only\" The statement \"Keep out of reach of children\" 5.10.2 Storage The medication was stored in the Pharmacy Department at Bankstown Hospital in a secure area. A sufficient supply of placebo and treatment was stored at each site for the initial consultation so that all subject s received the appropr iate medicine after randomisation. 1015.11 Sample Size and Power Calculations Due to the fact that no standard RCTs have been conducted previously to investigate the effect of CHM formulations in patients with VaD, there are no reliable data that could be used to accurately predict the anticipated sample size between placebo and WNK groups. We estimated that for ade quate power (80%) to detect a 20% difference on the ADAS-cog scores at the 5% significant level (two-tailed test), at least 30 patients were needed in each group. Allowing for 20% dropouts in the active arm, with full appliance in the placebo arm, 70 subjects were recruited, namel y, 35 subjects in each arm. 5.12 Data collection and Analysis of Efficacy Parameters Data was collected at various stages: base line, at 2 months, 4 months and 8 months during the course of the tria l. A SPSS database was estab lished to collect and keep data, in keeping with GCP guidelines. The Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method was used for the missing observations. Analysis of both observed cases at each scheduled visit and LOCF at Week 16 was con ducted. Week 16 LOCF using the ADAS-cog was defi ned as the primary endpoint evaluation for each patient. Analysis of safety was performed on the population that incl uded all patients who received at least one dose of study medi cation and who provide d any post-baseline follow up data. 102An independent (blinded) research assistan t was engaged to calculate all the scores and data entry. All data analysis was carried out using SPSS 14.0 software according to a pre-established analysis plan. Pearson product moment correlation and Cronbach alphas were used in the analysis of reliability and validity data, and factor analysis was used to determine construct valid ity. Independent-Sample T Test, one-way ANOVA, or ANCOVA (when necessary) was used to determine the differences among groups at baseline, end of treatmen t, and follow up. Outcome measures with categorical responses were analysed using X2 or Fisher's exact tests (when necessary). The main outcome included th e odds ratio and 95% confident intervals. All tests would be two-tailed and conducte d at the 5% signifi cance level. Data involved all patients who were randomly assigned. All data was monitored and double checked for anomalies and consistenc y by a blinded data entry assistant. 5.13 Data Handling Information on all participants was maintained in a locked filing cabinet within the Centre for Complementary Medicine Rese arch, along with other documents related to the clinical trial for a period of five years. All electronic data was stored on ha rd disc on the computer of the chief inves tigator with back up on floppy and compact discs. Files were accessible for review only to researchers directly involved in the project. Specific request needed to be ma de to the chief investigator for access by any other person. Confidentiality was maintain ed throughout the trial by al locating all pa rticipants identification codes from the start. All questionnaires, documentation and data only 103refer to participant ID codes. Participants may request access to their own data, an d may preview the results of the study. In compliance with the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, research records were made available to the TGA as required. All documentation relating to the study and raw data are retained for seven years, after which files will be destroyed and documents shredded. 5.14 Summary The methodological design of this trial was fully compliant with 'the revised CONSORT Statement for RCTs' and accommodat ed lessons learnt from the review of the clinical trials on VaD. The scientific characteristics of the trial include: A standardised RCT Specific objectives and hypotheses A standardised population with clear in clusion and exclusion criteria based on precise sample size calculation Blinded randomisation Blinding of participants, investigatin g staff, pharmacists and data analyst GMP standard intervention and place bo products and well established placebo control group An appropriate trial length with extended follow up Scientific treatment procedures in terms of screening, assessment, dosage administration, modification of treatment, missed appointments, and withdraw policy 104 Appropriate data handling and statistical analysis The methodology of this clinical trial sets a standard for other trials investigating the effects of complementary medicine for VaD. 105________________ CHAPTER VI Diagnostic Criteria, Outcome Measures and Forms ______________________________ ____________________________ This chapter introduces the diagnostic crit eria (including a newly developed NINDS- AIREN criterion for VaD), and all outcome measures applied in this clinical trial . 6.1 Diagnostic Criteria The diagnoses of probable and possible Va D was based on the Na tional Institute for Neurologic Disease and Stroke and the Asso ciation Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria (See Appendix 2), the most widely used and established standard for drug trials on VaD. It is also the strictest and with the highest specificity (Tallis & Fillit, 1992; Pohjasvaara et al., 2000; Gallo et al, 1995; et al, 1993). The NINDS-AIREN criteria for VaD incl ude three main domains: dementia syndrome, cerebrovascular disease, and a relationship between them. Cerebrovascular disease is defined by the presence of focal neurological signs and detailed brain imaging evidence of ischaem ic changes in the brain. A relationship between dementia and cerebrova scular disorder is based on the onset of dementia within three months following a recognised stroke, or an abrupt deterioration in cognitive functions or fluctuating, stepwi se progression of cognitive deficits. The criteria include a list of feat ures consistent with the diagnosis, as well as a list of 106features that make the diagnos is uncertain or unlikely. In addition different levels of certainty of the clinical diagnosis (probable or possi ble) are included. The NINDS- AIREN criteria recognise heterogeneity of the syndrome and variability of the clinical course in VaD, and highlight detection of ischaemic lesions and a relationship between lesion and cognition, as well as stroke and dementia onset (Emeriau et al, 2000). 6.1.1 The NINDS-AIREN Criteria for VaD The following is the original NINDS-AIREN criteria for the diagnosis of VaD (Roman et al, 1993): I. The criteria for the clinical diagnosis of probable vascular dementia include all of the following: Dementia defined by cognitive decline from a previously higher level of functioning and manifested by impairment of memory and of two or more cognitive domains (orientation, attention, langua ge, visuospatial functions , executive functions, motor control, and praxis), preferably establis hed by clinical examin ation and documented by neuropsychological testing; deficits should be severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living and not due to physical effects of stroke alone. Exclusion criteria : cases with disturbance of c onsciousness, delirium, psychosis, severe aphasia, or major sensorimotor impairment precluding neuropsychological testing. Also excluded are systemic disorder s or other brain diseases (such as AD) that in and of themselves could accoun t for deficits in memory and cognition. 1. Cerebrovascular disease , defined by the presence of focal signs on neurologic examination, such as hemiparesis, lower facial weakness, Babinski sign, sensory deficit, hemia nopia, and dysarthria consistent with 107stroke (with or w ithout history of stroke), an d evidence of relevant CVD by brain imaging (CT or MRI) including multiple large vessel infarcts or a single strategically placed infarct (angular gyrus, thalamus, basal forebrain, or PCA ries), as multiple basal ganglia and white matter lacunes , or extensive periventricular white matter lesions , or combinations thereof. 2. A relationship between the above two disorders manifested or inferred by the presence of one or more of the follo wing: (a) onset of dementia within 3 months following a recogni zed stroke; (b) abrupt de terioration in cognitive functions; or fluctuating, stepwise progression of cognitive deficits. II. Clinical features consistent with the diagnosis of probable vascular dementia include the following: (a) Early presence of gait disturbance (small-step gait or marche a petits pas, or magnetic, apraxic-at axic or parkinsonian (b) history uent, unprovoked falls; (c) early urinary frequency, urgency, and other not explained by urologic disease; (d ) pseudobulbar palsy; and (e) personality and mood changes, abulia, depression, emotional incontinence, or other subcortica l deficits including psychomotor retardation and abnormal executive function. III. Features that make the diagnosis of vascular dementia uncertain or unlikely include (a) early onset of memory deficit and progr essive worsening of memory deficit and progressive worsening of memo ry and other cognitive functions such as language (transcortical sensory aphasia), motor skills (aprax ia), and perception (agnosia), in the absence of correspondi ng focal lesions on brain imaging; (b) 108absence of focal neurological signs, other than cognitive disturbance; and (c) absence of cerebrovascular lesion s on brain CT or MRI. IV. Clinical diagnosis of possible vascular dementia may be made in the presence of dementia (section I-1) with focal neurologic signs in patients in whom brain imaging studies to confirm definite CVD are missing; or in the absence of clear temporal relationship between dementia and stroke; or in patients with subtle onset an d variable course (plateau or improvement) of cognitive deficits and evidence of relevant CVD. V. Criteria for diagnosis of definite vascular dementia are (a) clinical criteria for probable vascular dementia; (b) histopathol ogic evidence of CVD or autopsy; (c) abse nce of neurofibrillary tang les and neuritic plaques exceeding those expected for age; and (d) ab sence of other clinical or pathological disorder capable of producing dementia. VI. Classification of vascular dementia for research purposes may be made on the basis of clinical, radiologi c, and neuropathologic feat ures, for subcategories or defined such vascular dementia, subcortical vascular dementia, BD, and thalamic dementia. The term \"AD with CVD\" should be reserved to classify patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for possi ble AD and who also present clinical or brain imaging evidence of relevant CVD. Traditionally, these patients have been included with Va D 109in epidemiologic studies. The term \"mixed dementia,\" used hitherto, should be avoided. 6.1.2 The Creation of the Table Format of the NINDS-AIREN criteria for VaD The original NINDS-AIREN criteria for VaD is complicated, confusing and not convenient for the doctors to screen partic ipants. In order to make uniform these main diagnostic criteria and f acilitate the medical screenin g procedure, a table format of the NINDS-AIREN criteria has been crea ted and applied in the medical screening after discussion and consultation with se veral geriatricians, neurologists and neuropsychologists (see detail s in Table 6.1 and Appendix 2). 110Table 6.1 The NINDS-AIREN crit eria for patient inclusion I. Dementia (1 and/or 2) 1. Cognitive decline i. Impairment of memory ii. Impairment of cognitive domains ( two or more ) a. Orientation b. Attention c. Language d. Visuospatial functions e.

I-1 + II-2 6.2 Outcome Measures Two instruments were used in the present study to evaluate the cognitive function: ADAS-cog as the primary and MMSE as the secondary outcome measure. ADAS- cog and MMSE were likely to be the most useful measures to accurately judge the cognitive function since they are well standardized. The ADAS-cog is more detailed than the MMSE, although it also takes more time to administer and requires some equipment such as word lists and objects for naming (Mohs, 2004). MMSE, a validated outcome measure for cognitive impairment associated with dementia, w as explored along with ADAS-cog not only to measure the cognitive impairments associated with VaD, but also to be a concurrent validity measure for ADAS-cog. 6.2.1 Primary outcome measure The primary efficacy measure used in the c linical trial was the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) (see Appendix 8). ADAS-cog is a quantitative instrument designed to assess the severity of cognitive impairment over time in Alzheimer's disease patients (Mohs & Cohen, 1988), and has been used most widely in clinical investigations (Mohs, 2004). It consists of 11 items, which are referred to as the four core symptoms of dementia: memory, 112orientation, language, and pr axis. Structure of the ADAS-cog was detailed in Table 6.2. A score between 0 and 70 is possible on the cognitive part of the scale, where 0 means the patient made no errors at all an d 70 means the patient is profoundly demented (Mohs, 2004).

The word recall task is administered first and then the following c ognitive functions are assessed in an open ended conversation. The number of items, scores and content in each cognitive item are summarised on Table 6.3. 113Table 6.3 Cognitive functions, number of items and scores, and summary of content for the ADAS-cog (Summarised from Administration and Scoring Manual for the ADAS-cog scale, Richar d C.

Almost two thirds of all clinical trials on VaD have adopted MMSE as an outcome measure. It is one of the most widely used clinical instruments for quickly detecting cognitive impairment and assessing its severity, as well as for monitoring cognitive changes over time. It is a brief, quantitative measure of cognitive status in adults. It can be used to screen for cognitive impairment, to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment at a given point in time, to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time, and to document an i ndividual's response to treatment (Folstein et al, 1975). It is an 11-question measure that te sts five areas of cognitive function including orientation, regist ration, attention and calcula tion, recall and language. The maximum score is 30. A score of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment. Table 6.4 summarises the content, number of items, and range of scores. The MMSE takes only 5-10 minutes to administer and is therefore practical to use repeatedly and routinely (Kurlowicz & Wallace , 1999). The MMSE is attached as Appendix 14. 115Table 6.4 Summary of the MMSE Concepts No. of items Maximum score Summary of content Orientation 10 10 Determines how well oriented the patient is with regards to time and place Registration 3 3 Evaluates the ability of remembering words Attention and calculation 5 5 Assesses the capability of concentration and calculation Recall 3 3 Assesses patient's short term memory by recalling words Language 5 patient's praxis by drawing diagram Total Score 30 Notes: 24 to 30 = within normal limits 18 to 23 = mild to moderate dognitive impairment 0 to 17 = severe cognitive impairment 6.2.2.2 The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperati ve Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) Loss of independence is one of the most important and inevitable deficits a person with dementia experiences as the disease progresses. While cognitive loss is the core clinical symptom that defines VaD, functional disabilities and behavioural disinhibition are often considered by families and clinicians to be more importa nt in terms of impact on everyday life (Barbas & Wilde, 2001; Gauthier, 1998). Functional disability is defined as 'any rest riction or inability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range consider ed normal for a huma n being', and is an important element associated with deterior ation in cognitive func tions. It affects the quality of life of both patie nts and caregivers. It has been argued that the enhancement of independence and the maintenance of quality of life will be the primary goal of treating dementia (Woods, 1999). Measuring the level of functional 116disability to assess the bene fits of dementia drugs, therefore, is becoming a primary issue from a clinical as well as regulato ry perspective (Kurz et al, 2003). However, these have not been primary outcomes in mo st drug trials of treatment for dementia to date. There is consensus that cognitive and global function measures, and assessments of abilities to perform Ac tivities of Daily Living (ADL) must be included as part of the optimal assessment battery in VaD trials (Galasko et al, 1997). Several instruments have been developed to assess the level of functional disability in dementia patients. ADCS-ADL scale is r ecently increasingly used as a measure for assessing functional disabilities in clinical trials for dementia. Recently, Kurz et al. (2003) developed a new appr oach to the qualitative evaluation of functional disability in dementia, as evaluated by ADL scores. Functional disability was assessed using the Katz scale for basic ac tivities of daily living (B-ADL), and Lawton scale for the instrumental activit ies of daily living (I-ADL). A k-means derived clustering method allocat ed patients to di sability clusters according to their Katz and Lawton scores. The progression of the disease can be measured by the three different disability levels, rather than by differences in quantitative scores alone. According to classification method of Kurz et al (2003), Livington et al (2004) developed a new dependency model and valid ated the application of ADCS-ADL to patients with Alzheimer's disease. This new structure of ADCS-ADL has not been validated in patients with VaD. The ADCS-ADL scale (Galasko et al, 1997) is a caregiver rated que stionnaire of 23 items, with possible scores over a range of 0-78, where 78 implies full functioning with no impairment. ADCS-ADL scale is la rgely comprised of basic activities (B- 117ADL) and instrumental activities (I-ADL ) (Katz et al, 1963; Lawton & Brody, 1969). B-ADL are simple activities (eating, wa lking, toileting, bathing, dressing etc), whereas I-ADL are more complex activities (using the telephone, preparing beverage or meal, using household appliance etc). Th e 'basic' score was calculated as the sum of six B-ADL items and ranged from 0 to 22 (22 indicating complete independence of the patient for all specified activiti es). The second, a 'domestic' score, was calculated as the sum of the eleven 'domestic' items and ranged from 0 to 39 (39 indicating complete independence of the patient for all specified domestic ac tivities). The third, a 'communication' score, wa s calculated as the sum of the six communication related items and ranged from 0 to 17 (17 indicating complete independence of the patient for all specified communication activities) (Kurz et al., 2003; G Livingston et al., 2003). The three act ivities are summarised in Table 6.5. 118Table 6.5 Structure of the ADCS-ADL (Summarised from Li vingston et al, 2004) Functional activities Number of items Items included (poi nts) Total Number of points Basic activities 6 1.

The ADCS-ADL form is attached as Appendix 10. 6.2.2.3 The short form 36 health survey questionnaire (SF-36) The SF-36 is a multipurpose, short form health survey with only 36-item questionnaire developed from the Medica l Outcomes Study (War e et al, 1993). It consists of eight health scales and each he alth scale is compri sed of a number of items and levels. Two core dimensions of health, physical and mental, can be derived 119from the eight health scales of SF-36. VaD, with both physical and cognitive dysfunctions, is ideally suitable to test the SF-36 health measure. One separate item (Item 2) is used to assess any change in patient's health from 1 year before. The health scales are summarised in Table 6.6. Th e SF-36 Health Survey form is attached as Appendix 11.

An MMSE of greater than 20 was defined as 'mild', scores between 10 and 20 as 'moderate', and those below 10 as 'severe' de mentia (Folstein et al, 1975). 6.3 Forms These forms are used in the recruitment and assessment process .

In addition, the reliability and validity of the assessment scales, results of follow up assessment, the relevant adverse effect s of trial medication, and the success of the blinding of trial are reported. 7.1 Recruitment and Screening Subsequent to screening by ge riatricians or neurologists, participants were required to undertake pathology tests and/ or CT scan to confirm thei r eligibilitiy fo r the trial. Participants were then randomised by the chie f investigator into their treatment group according to the randomisation code developed by a computer random number generator. Over a two-year period, a total of 112 volunteers from urban, suburban and rural areas presented themselves for the trial. Upon the signi ng of the consent form, all participants had formal screening by geri atricians or neurologists according to the 122preset inclusion and exclusion criteria. A blood test for all participants and a CT scan for some participants was also required. Forty-eight volunteers were deemed inelig ible for various reasons including: Severe illnesses or not matching VaD Abnormalities in laboratory tests Diagnosis of AD without cer ebral vascular disease Withdrawal of consent and other reasons Others Sixty-four participants were eligible and recruited: 30 were randomised into the placebo group, and 34 into the WNK gr oup. However, two subjects from WNK group decided not to continue after a short term intervention as a result of adverse events. As they did not even complete th e first post treament review, they were considered as non-starters in the trial (F igure 7.1). 123 Figure 7.1 Patients progress through stages of the trial Screen failures N = 48 Reasons for failures: 1.

Participant groups were similar in terms of age (mean: 74.1 \u00b1 7.2 in placebo and 75.0 \u00b1 7.4 in WNK group), sex distributions, language spoken at hom e, and education level. Among the 62 participants, 22 were male, and 40 were female. There were 49 probable VaD participants and 13 possible VaD participants, based on the NINDS-AIREN criteria. The ratios of probable VaD versus possi ble VaD in placebo and WNK group were 25:5 and 24:8, respectively. There was no stat istical significance between two groups (P=0.42). In addition, no signi ficant differences were f ound between patients in the two groups in terms of total severity of symptoms as judged by MMSE (P=0.47). The ratios of mild versus moderate Va D in placebo and WNK group were 14:16 and 12:20, respectively. Twelve patients (38%) in WNK treatment gr oup had a family history of dementia and/or memory impairment, compared with seven patients (23 %) in placebo group (P = 0.38). The common coexisting diseases, which included hypertension, clinical identified stroke or transient ischemic a ttack, high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease, were similar in two groups (see Table 7.1). Compliance with study medication was high as measured by a questionnaire item and by random pill counts, and there was no difference between groups (95% for WNK group, and 96% for placebo). Non study medication consumption did not change significantly for any gr oup during the treatment period. 125Table 7.1 Participants' characteristics at baseline Characteristic Placebo group (N = 30) WNK group (N = 32) P value Diagnosis Probable v Possible VaD Mild v Moderate VaD Language spoken at home (English vs no English) Mean education level \u00b1 SD , y Mean age \u00b1 SD, y Sex ratio(male: female) Family history of dementia /memor y impairment, n (%) Coexisting diseases, n (%) Hypertension Clinical identified stroke/TIA High cholesterol Diabetes Heart disease 25 : 5 14 : 16 21 : 9 9.6 \u00b1 3.5 74.1 \u00b1 7.2 10 : 20 7 (23) 15 (50) 8 (27) 6 (20) 5 (17) 11 (34) 24 : 8 12 : 20 20 : 12 9.3 \u00b1 3.7 75.0 \u00b1 7.4 12 : 20 12 (38) 16 (50) 10 (31) 8 (25) 4 (13) 7 (22) .42 .47 .53 .79 .59 .73 .38 1.00 .77 .71 .69 .34 7.3 Primary Outcome Measure for C ognitive Function - the ADAS-cog 7.3.1 Reliability of the ADAS-cog The reliability of the ADA S-cog was determined by inter rater reliability and internal consistency reliability . Internal consistency was assessed using inter item correlations (Cronbach alphas calculated ) for the whole scale and individual subscales. 126Inter rater reliability Firstly, the investigating st affs were trained by a ne uropsychologist, who was a specialist in neuropsychologi cal measurements for cognitiv e functions, to standardise the ADAS-cog score. This training was conducte d face to face, and/or by video and cassette recordings until the raters fully understood and properly conducted the questions and ratings on specific items. Th en investigating staff were required to conduct the ADAS-cog assessment on actual Va D patients at the Memory Disorder Clinic of Bankstown Hospital under superv ision of the neuropsychologist. During this assessment, both the investigating st aff and the neuropsychol ogist were checking off which category each observation fell in and recording in a separate assessment form. A 'calibration meeting' was held after each assessment to discuss and esta blish rules for deciding the rating on each specific item. The perc ent of agreement between investigating staff and neur opsychologist was calculated. The percent of agreement between them for the last five assessm ents was 96 percent (see Table 7.2). Table 7.2 Inter rater reliability of ADAS-cog Time Total items Items rated same score by two raters Matching rate (%) 1 11 10 91 2 11 11 100 3 11 10 91 4 11 11 100 5 11 11 100 Total 55 53 96 Internal consistency The internal consistency of the ADAS-cog was assessed using inter item correlati ons that were found to be uniformly high. The Pearson correlation coefficient was in the 127range of 0.55 to 0.91 at the commencement (Table 7.3), and of 0.44 to 0.94 at the end of treatment (Table 7.4). The Cronbach's coefficient alpha (representing average inter item correlation) was 0.93 and 0.94 at the beginning and end of treatment respectively. The ADAS-cog, as a whole, demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency when applied to VaD patients, that is, the instrument is a valid cognitiv e function construct for VaD patients.

Note: WT: Word recall task NA: test instructions SA: Spoken language ability WF: Word finding difficulty CL: Comprehension of spoken language 7.3.2 Validity of the ADAS-cog The validity of the ADAS-cog was tested by face, content and concurrent validity . Pearson product moment co rrelation was employed in the concurrent validity to identify the correlation between the patient's ADAS-cog scores and another validated cognitive function scale - MMSE. MMSE WT NA CM CP validity While face validity is to see whether \"on its face\" it seems like a good translation of the construct, content validity essen tially checks if the ADAS-cog has a good detailed description of the content do main. The ADAS-cog had high face and good content validity. We sent the ADAS-cog to a carefully selected expert panel, which included two geriatricians, one neurologi st and two neuropsychologists working in the area of aged care and neurologiy. Thei r feedback judged the measure to be a good measure of cognitive function and in clude all the key domains of cognitive function: short term memory, orientation, registration, langu age, visuospatial, praxis and comprehension. Concurrent validity MMSE, a well-standardised and valid ated outcome measure for cognitive impairment associated with VaD, wa s conducted along with ADAS-cog for concurrent validity at the commencement and end of treatment. The results showed that the total ADAS-cog score inversely co rrelated with the total MMSE score. Pearson correlation co efficient was in the range of r = -0.914 to -0.968 (P < 0.001) (Table 7.5). This indicated that the severity of cognitive impairment demonstrated by ADAS-cog was similar to that shown by MMSE. 130Table 7.5 Correlations between MMSE and ADAS-cog at baseli ne and end for all participants ADAS-cog total at baseline (N=62) ADAS-cog total at week 16 (N=62) MMSE total at week 16 (N=62) MMSE total at baseline (N=62) ADAS-cog total at baseline 1 ADAS-cog total at week 16 .968(**) 1 MMSE total at week 16 -.924(**) -.932(**) 1 MMSE total at baseline -.923(**) -.914(**) .968(**) 1 **. Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed) In addition, a highly significant correlation was showed between each subscale of ADAS-cog and the total MMSE score. Ta ble 7.3 and 7.4 showed the correlation between each of the 11 subscales and MMSE at start and end of the treatment. That is, each scale of ADAS-cog cl early reflected the severity of cognitive dysfunction demonstrated by MMSE, indicating the ADA S-cog may be a valid measure of the severity of cognitive impairment associated with VaD. 7.3.3 Changes of the Total Mean of ADAS-cog For the primary outcome measure, AD AS-cog as assessed by investigators, demonstrated that patients receiving WNK formulation re sponded significantly better than patients receiving placebo. Baseline assessment Two participants who withdrew from WNK group within one week after involvement were considered as non starters in the trial. Hence, pe r protocol analysis is same as intention-to-tr eat analysis. Per protocol an alysis was undertaken on 30 participants in placebo group and 32 in active group. The baseline total means of ADAS-cog were 24.48 \u00b1 2.88 in WNK gr oup and 18.98 \u00b1 2.78 (mean \u00b1 SE) in 131placebo groups. There was no st atistical significant differe nce between two groups (P = 0.18). Week 8 Assessment At Week 8 of treatment, the means of ADAS-cog in both WN K and placebo group were reduced. By Week 8, the mean ADAS-cog decreased from 24.48 to 22.47 (mean reduction, 2.01) for those in W NK group, and from 18.98 to 17.39 (mean reduction, 1.59) for those in the placebo group (see details in Table 7.6). The difference in mean reduction between WN K group and placebo in ADAS-cog were - 0.43 (95% confidence interv al, -1.79 to 2.64; P = 0.70). Table 7.6 Changes of participants' mean total ADAS-cog scores at baseline and Week 8 of treatment Group N Mean Difference (between baseline and week 8) Mean \u00b1 SE Mean Difference (between groups) Mean \u00b1 SE 95% CI Lower Upper P value (2-tailed) Placebo WNK 30 32 - 1.59 0.43 \u00b1 1.11 -1.79 2.64 0.70 Week 16 Assessment After Week 8, the scores of ADAS-cog in WNK group continued to decline until the end of treatment, while that in placebo group slightly increased. The mean reduction in ADAS-cog from the baseline to Week 16 was significantly greater for those receiving WNK than those receiving pl acebo. By Week 16, the mean ADAS-cog went from 24.48 to 20.30 (mean reduction, 4.1 8) for those in the active treatment with WNK and from 18.98 to 17.81 (mean re duction, 1.18) for those in the placebo group. The difference in mean reduction be tween WNK treated a nd placebo group in ADAS-cog was -3.00 (95% CI, -4.91 to -1.10;) (Table 7.7). 132 Table 7.7 Difference of participants' me an total ADAS-cog score at start and end of treatment Group N Mean Difference (between baseline and end of treatment) Mean \u00b1 SE Mean Difference (between groups) Mean \u00b1 SE 95% CI Lower Upper P value (2-tailed) Placebo WNK 30 32 - 1.18 \u00b1 3.00 \u00b1 0.95 0.003 The mean differences of the total ADAS-c og from baseline to Week 8 and from baseline to the end of treatment are shown on Figure 7.2. 0123456 Week 8 Week 16mean difference Placebo WNK Figure 7.2 The mean difference of total ADAS -cog from baseline to Week 8, and to Week 16 It was noted there was a baseline diffe rence between the two groups, although the difference was not judged clinically signifi cant. To test whether WNK still had an effect on ADAS-cog score after removing the baseline differences, the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was performed w ith the baseline ADAS-cog score as a 133covariate. The ANCOVA also showed that the mean differen ce between groups was statistically significan t [F (df1, df2) = 9.00, p = 0.004]. At the end of the trial, the changes of symptoms improved, stayed the same, or worsened (Table 7.8; Figure 7.3) showed a significant association by treatment group (X2 = 6.24; P = 0.04; Fisher's exact = 0.049). Sevent y two percent (23 out of 32) of patients in the active herb group improved (according to scores of ADAS-cog), in contrast to 47 percent (14 out of 30) of patients in th e placebo group (Table 7.8). The patients in WNK compared with place bo group worsened by 12 percent (4 out of 32) and 40 percent (12 out of 40), respectively.

It wa s therefore of interest to see which subscale had been significantly change d and was most sensitive to detect improvement in the WNK group. A paired sample t-test was used to comp are mean ADAS-cog scores for each of the eleven subscales from the start to the e nd of treatment in the WNK group. While the scores of all subscales were reduced at the end of the treatment, scores for 'word recall', were reduced including 'c onstructional praxis', 'ideational did not ch ange significantly over the duration of the treatment. There is a trend towards an improvement of 'word recognition', but the change just failed to reach statistical si gnificance (p=0.053). 135Figure 7.4 shows that seven subscales out of 11 had significant changes at the end of the treatment in WNK group.

Re sults showed that the treatment effects discontinued and pa tients' symptoms in both groups were slightly worse. The mean total of ADAS-cog increased from 20.30 to 21.92 (mean increase 1.61 \u00b1 0.75) for those in WNK group, and from 17.80 to 19.52 (mean increase, 1.71 \u00b1 0.81) in placebo group. The difference in mean increase between WNK group and placebo in ADAS-cog were -0.1 (95% confidence interval, -2.11 to 2.31; P = 0.93). There was no significan t difference between WNK and placebo group (see Table 7.10). 137 Table 7.10 The changes of participants' mean total ADAS-cog Score at Week 16 and follow-up of treatment Group N Mean Difference (between week 16 and week 32) Mean \u00b1 SE Mean Difference (between groups) Mean \u00b1 SE 95% CI Lower Upper P value (2-tailed) Placebo Measure for asse ssing Cognitive Function - MMSE As one of the most commonly used and validated outcome measures for dementing disorders, MMSE has been widely employe d in both western medicine (Wilcock et al, 2002; Kurz, 2002) and Chinese herbal me dicine clinical trials (Zhang & Yang, 2002; Huang et al, 2002). The MMSE is effective as a screening instrument to differentiate patient s with cognitive impairment from those without it. In addition, when used repeatedly, the instrument is able to measure change in cognitive status that may benefit from intervention (Kurlowicz & Wallace, 1999). Si nce its first use in 1975, the MMSE has been validated and extensively used in both clinical practice and re search (Folstein et al, 1975; Crum et al, 1993). 138Changes in total score of MMSE The MMSE scores of patients improved after 16 week treatm ent in WNK group. The mean differences between the baseline a nd the end of treatment in WNK group and the placebo group were 1.2 and 0.3 respectively (Table 7.11). The inter group difference was 0.92 (95% CI, -1.88 to 0.45) which just failed to reach statistical significance ( P = 0.06).

One patient developed sleep disturbance , waking 4-5 times with difficu lty going back to sleep while taking the trial medication. A medical review wa s conducted by geriat ricians and chief investigator on the patient and decision was made to withdraw the patient from the trial. The second patient withdrew from the trial after gradually developing headache, although similar episodes o ccured previously on star ting any new medication. The symptom subsided on discontinuation of trea tment. Both patients were later found to be in WNK group. 141No other major adverse effects were noted on the monthly safety monitoring reports. No abnormal values were found on full bl ood count, liver and renal function tests conducted on each visit (see Table 7.14).

Each participant was asked to taste the WNK and placebo capsules. Result showed that 23 pa rticipants (92%) were unable to tell the difference between the WNK and placebo in te rms of taste, smell and look. Only one participant successfully identified the WNK, and another participant failed in identification. At the end of the trial, the participants we re asked to try to identify which treatment they had received. Forty four percent (14 out of 32) of the WNK recipients and 33 percent (10 out of 30) of th e placebo recipients correc tly identified their group assignment. There was no significa nt difference between two groups ( X2 = 1.06; P = 0.59) (Table 7.15, Figure 7.7).

However, these studies enrolled small numbers of participant s, employed various designs without uniform diagnostic criteria, poor randomisation, exhibited lack of attention to blinding, had poorly defined outcome measures, and weak statistical analysis. The present clinical study is of special interest because it is the first to evaluate the effects of a co mplex Chinese herb formulation in a well 143defined population with probable or possibl e, mild to moderate VaD based on the NINDS-AIREN criteria, and the first clinical trial of CHM for VaD following a rigorous clinical trial methodology, which addr essed the principal concerns raised by the systematic review. Participant screening was performed using validated diagnostic cr iteria (the NINDS- AIREN criteria) by qualified doctors an d trained investigat ors based on strict inclusion and exclusion crit eria. The particip ants were from urban, suburban and rural areas in State of New South Wales a nd therefore can largely represent a whole cohort of Australia. VaD is now recognised to consist of a numbe r of sub forms rather than constituting a uniform clinical entity (Pantoni et al, 2000). The NINDS-AIREN, adopts a multidimensional diagnostic approach combining clinical, radiological, and psychometric criteria. A lthough the standardisation of VaD diagnosis remains difficult, the NINDS-AIREN criteria are widely accepted by regulatory authorities for drug trials (Fisher & Bowler, 2003). In the present study, there were a greater number of probable rather than possibl e VaD patients recruited. The two patient cohorts were similar in terms of age, se x, language spoken at home, education level, family histories, common coexisting diseas es, and the severity of symptoms. The baseline demographic data showed elig ible and credible characteristics for conducting randomised controlled trial on VaD. Except in the studies of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 (Le Bars et al., 1997 & 2000), the cognitive rating sc ale ADAS-cog had never b een used to assess the 144cognitive effects of Chinese herbal medicine. The present study tested the reliability, validity and sensitiv ity of the ADAS-cog as a meas ure of change on cognitive function in patients with VaD. The ADAS-cog has been demonstrated to have adequate internal consis tency and inter rater relia bilitiy. The ADAS-cog had high face and content validity, and concurrent validity when comparing both the total ADAS-cog and each subscale of ADAS-cog with the MMSE, which is a well standardized and validated outcome meas ure for cognitive impairment associated with VaD. In addition, the subscale analys is indicated that th e cognitive function related subscales were sensitive to detect WNK induced cognitive function improvement. In summary, the ADAS-cog appear s to be a valid m easure of cognitive function and its change following intervention in VaD patients. The baseline reading of the mean ADAS-c og total score (24.48) in the WNK group in the present study is similar to those publ ished scores in similar patient cohorts by Erkinjuntti (2002) (24.1 \u00b1 9.9 in placebo group and 22.3 \u00b1 8.8 in treatment group) and by Wilcock et al (2002). Th e score of ADAS-cog in WNK group went down from 24.48 to 22.47 at Week 8, and continuously we nt down to 20.3 at Week16. Thus, the reduction of ADA-cog in the WNK group is unlikely due to regression to the mean. The baseline mean ADAS-cog total score in the placebo group, however, was lower than that in the herbal group, although the difference was not stat istically significant. The reason for this discrepancy may be multifactorial, with the main reason being due to the relatively small sample size. It was noted that there were more patients with mild cognitive impairment (defined by MMSE) than those with moderate impairment (mild: moderate = 14:16) in the placebo group, when compared to those in the active treatment group (mild: modera te = 12:20). This may partially explain 145the lower baseline ADAS-cog figure in the control group. Furthe rmore, even in studies with much larger sample sizes, such as the clinical tria l by Erkinjuntti (2002) where a total of 592 participants were involved, unbalanced inter group baseline ADAS-cog were still observed. To minimise impact of the different baseline characteristics in the current study, an analysis of cova riance (ANCOVA) test was employed to increase statistical power as th is method accounts fo r the variability of baseline. The significant improvement of cognitive function was further confirmed by this analysis (P = 0.004 by ANCOVA). It is worth noting that the mean ADAS-cog scores were both slightly decreased in WNK and the placebo groups in Week 8 of the interventions. However, this trend of cognitive function improvement disappeared in the placebo group in Week 16 while the improvement continued in the WNK group. This initial improvement in the placebo group may be largely e xplained by the placebo effect. In the present study, the improvements in cognitive functions induced by WNK discontinued following the cessation of the in tervention. This would suggest that the WNK formulation was more effective in re leasing symptoms associated with VaD during the treatment than in addressing the root causes of the disease. If the latter was the case, one would expect a longer lasting effect ev en after the treatment was stopped. It is also possible that if the fo llow ups were undertaken earlier, e.g., 8 weeks after the cessation of the treatment (as opposed to 16 weeks), some residual effects of WNK may have been observed. To addre ss this issue, further consideration should be given to improve the formulation to ensure a greater effect on the root causes of the disease. For example, the form ula may be tailored to individual patients 146according to his or her TCM disease patter n. A previous clinical study (Bensoussan et al, 1998) of Chinese herbal medicines for the management of irritable bowel syndrome demonstrated a longer lasting effect of the formula in patients receiving individualised treatment than thos e receiving standardised treatment. As a validated outcome measure for cogni tive function associat ed with dementia, MMSE was used for not only a criterion m easure for concurrent validity of ADAS- cog but also a secondary outcome measur e for cognitive function. Although a trend towards improvement of MMSE scores was noted in the WNK group, this change was not statistically significant. The s ubscale analysis has, however, shown a significant improvement in the 'orientation' score of the six subscales of MMSE. According to the data from previous st udies, the differences in MMSE between treatment groups (Zhang et al, 2000; Wang et al, 2000 for example) were relatively smaller than those in ADAS-cog (Le Bars et al, 2000; Wilcock et al, 2002). This may imply that MMSE may be less sensitive than ADAS-cog to detect changes in cognitive function improvement in dementia patients. Moreover, the smaller sample size of this study may have been insuffici ent to detect the differences of MMSE between groups. Minimal adverse effects were reporte d in the present study. The observed disturbance of sleep may be caused by gi nseng's general exci tation property in nervous system. Crocus sativus may produce slight vasodilatation which may account for the headache developed, alt hough headache frequently occur on commencement of many other medicati ons. Full blood count , liver and renal functions and other biochemistry indices, which are conducted in standard western 147medicine clinical trials, were closely m onitored on each visit from baseline to Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 16. No a bnormal values were observed during the treatment course. We are therefore convinced that WNK is safe when administered to VaD patients within the nominated do sage range by oral administration. All efforts have been made to keep the b linding as successful as possible. Except for the complete indistinguishablility of pl acebo and WNK in terms of taste, look and smell, the evaluation of blinding showed the 'guessability' of group assignment by participants was not better than chance. During the study, all participants (patients and researchers) were completely blinded until the treatment and data collection and analyses were completed. Based on these data, we conc lude here that CHM formul ation WNK may be effective in improving the cognitive function associated with VaD and that the formula is safe in VaD patients. 148______________________ CHAPTER VIII Quality of Life in Patients with Vascular Dementia: Initial Validation of the SF-36 and Validation as a Measure of Change ______________________________ ____________________________ This chapter reports the effect of WNK on quality of life in patients with VaD. 8.1 Introduction Measures of health status assess different areas of health, ranging from physical to psychological to social functioning. In both the clinical setting and general population, patients' perceptions of health have been recognised to be as important as clinical assessments and physiological meas ures of organ functi on (Lubetkin et al, 2003). The SF-36, one of the validated health outcome measures, has been described as a generic status measure, reporting on a range of health dimensions as opposed to one that targets a specific age, disease, or treatment group (Jenkinson et al, 1993). More recently, the SF-36 was judged to be the most widely evaluated patient assessed health outcome measure and gain ing in popularity (John & Ware, 2004). The use of the SF-36 in estimating diseas e burden and comparing disease specific benchmarks with general population norms is illustrated in articles describing more than 200 diseases and conditions. The most frequently studied diseases and conditions with 50 or more publications each are: arthritis, back pain, cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, de pression, diabetes, 149gastrointestinal disease, irritable bowel syndrome, stroke, and musculoskeletal conditions (John & Ware, 2004). However, no information is available on its performance in vascular dementia, exhibi ting both neurological and psychological aspects. Two core dimensions of health, physical and mental, can be derived from the eight health scales of SF-36. VaD, ma nifesting with both physical and cognitive dysfunctions may be well suited to the SF-36 health measure. We assessed whether the SF-36 is a valid measure of health status and health change in patients with VaD. 8.2 Methods Because a majority of VaD patients in the Memory Disorder Clinic were unable to self complete the questionnaire due to mi sunderstanding, confusion, visual problems, and physical disability, face-to-face interv iews were used as the standard method throughout the current study. Scores for th e SF-36 were calculate d by computing raw scale scores and transforming each scale scor e to a 0 to 100 scale, with high scores indicating a better health status (Ware et al, 1993). The SF-36 was tested for reliability and valid ity in its application to VaD patients. Internal consistency was assessed using inter item correlations (Cronbach alphas calculated) for the whole scale and individua l subscales. Factor analysis was used to determine the construct validity of the i ndividual health subscales of the SF-36. Concurrent validity was applied to determ ine which items in the SF-36 most closely reflected the reported cognitive dysfunction. Pearson product moment correlation 150was employed in the concurrent validity to identify the correlation between the patient's SF-36 scores and their cognition function score - ADAS-cog. The sensitivity of the SF-36 to change in health status of VaD patients was determined by examining changes in SF-36 subscale scores from beginning to end of the treatment period (paired sample t-test). Chi-squared was used to examine changes in categorical responses to the SF-36 Item 2 (compared to one year ago, how would you rate your health in gene ral now?) from start to end of treatment. P values were all 2-tailed unless otherwise indicated; level of significance was set at 0.05. 8.3 Reliability of SF-36 Internal consistency The internal consistency of the SF-36 scal e was assessed using inter item correlations for each individual subscale. The correlation of 6 subscales (out of 8) was found to be high (Pearson correlation rang from 0.27 to 0.62 at baseline, and from 0.23 to 0.64 at Week 16, P < 0.05 or 0.01). Cronbach's coefficient alpha (representing average inter item correlations) was 0.78 and 0.80 at the beginning and the end of treatment respectively. The SF-36 as a whole demonstrat ed adequate internal consistency when applied to VaD patients, that is, the instrument is a valid general health construct for VaD patients. Inter item correlations within the eight su bscales were also calculated. Internal consistency by Cronbach's alpha satisfied Nunnally's criterion of 0.7 (Nunnally, 1978) for all eight scales excep t vitality (Cronbach's alpha 0.63). This has also been reported previously in stroke patients (A nderson et al, 1996). In ter item correlations 151within each subscale were gene rally strong except for 3a ( vigorous activities ) which was poorly correlated with 3j ( bathing or dressing yourself ) on both pre- and post- treatment, 3i ( walking one block ) on pre treatment only, and 3e ( climbing one flight of stairs ) on pre treatment only with in 'Physical functioning' subscale (Table 8.1). Table 8.1 Mean scores for SF-36 health scal es and internal consistency measures (average intra-scale correlations) at the start and the end of the intervention period (all patients) Health scale At start (n=62) Mean score (SD) Cronbach's alphs At end (n=62) Mean score (SD) Cronbach's alphs Physical functioning 69.6 71.4 74.5 (14.5) 0.72 8.4 Validity of the SF-36 Construct validity Construct validity was demonstrated by co mparing the scores for each of the 8 subscales of SF-36 between patients w ith VaD and the general population. Mean scores for each of the SF-36 health scales were standardised by age and sex for the VaD patients in the current study. This was achieved by adjusting mean scores for each age group and sex in the VaD group to reflect the normal population distribution figures provided by the Australia Bureau of St atistics (1995). A student t-test comparison of th e standardised mean betw een the known VaD group and 152normative data for the Australian populati on showed significance at P < 0.01 physical functioning role physical bodily pain general health vitality social functioningrole emotion mental healthmean scoresnormal Australian VaD Figure 8.1 Comparison of age and sex standardised SF-36 scores for the VaD cohort against age and sex standardis ed normative population data for Australia (age > 55) A principal components factor analysis was also applied to each health scale of SF- 36 before and after treatment of the SF-36. Except for the 'physical functioning' scale which had two factors of 4.6 and 1.7, a ll the other scales demonstrated only one factor with an Eigen value greater than 1. That means that all it ems within each scale (with the exception of the 'phys ical functioning' scale) ha d high correla tion with the first factor, indicating that items within each scale are measuring the same construct. The items 'bathing or dressing yourself', 'walking one block' and 'climbing one 153flight of stairs' signify a substantial or der of difference to the principle factor 'vigorous activities' in 'physical functioning' scale (Table 8.2). Table 8.2 Principal components factor analys is on SF-36 scales at pre- and post- treatment with percentage variance a ccounted by principal factors (all participants) Health scales Pre- treatment Eigen value % of variance Post-treatment Eigen value % of variance Physical functioning 4.6 46.6 4.8 47.6 Role physical 3.2 81.0 2.8 70.0 Bodily pain 1.7 86.6 1.9 92.7 General health 3.0 59.5 2.8 56.2 Vitality 1.9 48.1 2.3 56.3 Social functioning 1.6 81.8 1.7 87.4 Role emotion 2.7 88.9 2.4 80.0 Mental health 2.5 49.4 2.4 48.0 Concurrent validity Concurrent validity of the SF-36 health sc ale was determined at the commencement and the end of treatment against severity of cognitive impairment measured by ADAS-cog. The Pearson correlation coefficient ranged from -0.49 to - 0.10 for each health scale against the total cognitive function scores as evidenced by ADAS-cog (Table 8.3). This indicated that all hea lth scales demonstrated correlation with severity of cognitive func tion, although some were neit her sufficiently strong nor consistent. Highly significant correlation was shown between the severity of cognitive impairment and several SF-36 scales, which 'role emotion'. These health scales are also the key domains of VaD (cognitive impairment caused by small strokes). That 154is, the SF-36 scales clearly reflected the difference for VaD patients across these four health scales, indicating the SF-36 may be a valid measure of the severity of cognitive dysfunction associated with VaD.

The cognitive function, as evidenced by ADAS-cog, improved significantly in patien ts in the WNK group compared with those in the placebo group, as reported in Chap ter VII. Hence, it was of interest to see if the SF-36 was sufficiently sensitive to detect these changes in the treat ment group. The subscale analysis was conducted to see which health scale ha d been significantly changed. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare mean patient SF-36 scores for each health scale from commen cement to end of the treatment for all 155patients in WNK group (Table 8.5). While all scales showed improvement, changes in scale scores were significant for 'role emotion', 'mental hea lth', 0.05). No significant differenc es were noted in any of the scales for patien ts in placebo group.

Whilst there were no significant differences for the SF- 36 Item 2 between WNK and the placebo treatment groups on commencemen t of the treatment, partic ipants in the active group reported significant improvement over t hose in the placebo group by the end of the treatment (Table 8.6). This is consistent w ith the principal outcom e measures used in this trial.

Th e present study confirms the psychometric validity of the SF-36 for patients with VaD. The SF-36 Health Status Survey has been de monstrated to have adequate internal consistency, and both construc t and concurrent validity when applied to patients with VaD. Given both the mental symptoms (cognitive impairments) and physical symptoms (caused by cerebral vascular di sease) of VaD, it appears the SF-36, which consists of Mental Com ponent Summary (MCS includ ing mental health, role- emotional, social functioni ng etc) and Physical Compone nt Summary (PCS including physical functioning etc) could be adequa tely sensitive to most VaD clinical symptoms. We found the SF-36 was able to effectively distinguish VaD patients from the healthy population. Compared with the healthy population, our st udy showed that VaD affects patients on selected health scales of the SF-36 and demonstrates a clear profile of this disorder (Figure 8.1). While the VaD has a significant impact on the measures such VaD, the impact on other health measures (more indirectly related to VaD, i.e. 'bodily pain', 'general health', 'role physical', and 'vitality') not significant. Evidence of the validity of the SF-36 to provide an assessment of both physical and mental health is revealed by a decline in scores in a predictable manner across these four subscales. The SF-36 was tested on mild or moderate cases of VaD. For severe clinical presentation with complex mental symptoms, the ability of the SF-36 to reflect changes in the health status remains to be established. Our study demonstrates that the SF-36 is adequately sensitive to change in four subscales of the SF-36 in VaD patients, re presenting cognitive function and physical disability. At the end of treatment, the subs the actively treated group were shown to be significantly improved statistically compared with the commencement of treatment. 'Role emotion', 'mental health and 'social functioning' directly reflect components of VaD; while 'role physical' re flects the physical sensitive or insensitive to change. The first three physical component scales were less sens itive to VaD symptom change, as physical changes are not necessarily the main sympto ms of VaD. Although 'v itality' is one of the mental component scales in SF-36, it was neither directly measured by the ADAS-cog, nor does it correlate closely with severity of the VaD symptoms. 'Social functioning' and 'role physical' represen t constructs not recorded by cognitive function scores. Moreover, 'bodily pa in' and 'physical functioning' also 159demonstrated some (although insignificant) improvement after active treatment. Improvement in cognitive function in VaD may be related to improvement in the other aspects of patient's health. The SF-36 is able to identify changes in health status not measured by conventional assessments of VaD dysfunction. In summary, this study showed that the SF-36, when used in an interview setting, is a valid measure for health status and heal th change following intervention in VaD patients. 160______________________ CHAPTER IX Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL): Initial Validation and Validation as a Measure of Change ______________________________ ____________________________ This chapter reports the effect of WNK on activities of daily living, its validation in the context of VaD and its app lication as a measure of change in patients with VaD. 9.1 Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative St udy Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) scale is increasingly being used as a measure for assessing functional disabilities in clinical trials for dementia. According to methods developed by Kurz et al (2003) and Livington et al (2004) , the ADCS-ADL has been validated in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This new classification method for ADCS-ADL has not been validated in patients with VaD. In this present study, the ADCS-ADL provides evidence to measure changes in f unctional activities following intervention. The present study sought to validate a new qualitativ e classification method for functional disability in patients with VaD. In addition, the study sought to determine whether the ADCS-ADL is a valid measure of the change in functional disability following intervention for VaD. 1619.2 Statistical Analysis Structure of the ADCS-ADL Sc ale (Construct validity) Factor analysis was applied to determine the construct validity of the ADCS-ADL and/or the individual functi onal activities for VaD. External validation (Concurrent validity) The consistency of the new structure of ADL was externally validated using statistical analysis of the associations between the three functional act ivities of ADL and data collected from cognitive func tion and quality of life. Pearson product moment correlation was employed to identif y the degree of correlation between the patient' ADCS-ADL scores and their scores of cognitive function (measured by ADAS-cog and MMSE) and quality of life (measured by SF-36). Internal consistency Internal consistency was assessed using inter item correlation (and Cronbach alphas calculated) for the ADCS-ADL scale and the individual subfunctional activiti es. Sensitivity to change The sensitivity of the ADCS-ADL to change in functional activities of VaD patients was tested by examining changes in ADCS- ADL scores from begi nning to end of the treatment period using paired sample t-test. 1629.3 Results The ADCS-ADL was conducted by interviewing the carer of the participant. All 64 patients who entered the trial completed the ADCS-ADL on commencement, 62 patients completed it on exit or completion of the trial. 9.3.1 Structure of the ADCS-ADL Scale (Construct validity) A principal components factor analysis wa s applied to each ac tivity scale of the ADCS-ADL for both at commencement and end of the treatment. Table 9.1 summarised Eigen values and the percen tage of variance accounted for by each principal factor. On each o ccasion, there was only one fact or in activity scales with an Eigen value greater than one, which mean s all items within each scale measured the same construct and had significant correlation with the first factor. Table 9.1 Principal components factor an alysis on ADCS-ADL scales at pre- and post-treatment with percentage variance accounted by principal factors (all participants) Health scales Pre- treatment Eigen value % of variance Post-treatment Eigen value % of variance Basic activities 5.7 81.8 5.4 77.7 Domestic activities 7.2 65.4 7.6 69.1 Communication activities 3.5 58.2 3.6 60.4 9.3.2 External Validation (concurrent validity) The ADCS-ADL scales were reversely corr elated with the severity of cognitive impairment as evidenced by ADAS-cog. The Pearson correlation coefficient was in the range of -0.89 to -0.70 for each activity scale (basic, domestic and communication activities) against the total cognitive impairment score (P < 0.01, see Table 9.2). Hence, adequate external validity was shown as tested at the 163commencement and end of treatment agai nst both patients' rating of cognitive function and quality of life.

The ADCS-ADL scales were also strongly co rrelated with the severity of cognitive function as evidenced by MMSE. The Pear son correlation coefficient was in the range of 0.67 to 0.85 for each activity scale against the total cognitive impairment score (P < 0.01, see Table 9.3).

Quality of life of patients (as measured by SF-36) showed a statistically significan t association with each daily activity scale of ADL. As Table 9.4 demonstrated, the Pearson correlation coefficient was in the range of 0.38 to 0.52 for each activity scale against the total c ognitive impairment score (P < 0.01). 164 Table 9.4 Pearson product moment correl ation coefficients between patient responses on ADCS-ADL and quality of life by SF-36 (all participants) Health scales Pre-treatment Correlations Communication activities .381(**) .453(**) ** Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed). * Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed). 9.3.3 Internal Consistency The internal consistency of the ADL scale was assessed using inter item correla tions that were found to be uniformly high (Pear son correlation range from 0.67 to 0.86 at baseline, and from 0.74 to 0.91 at Week 16, P < 0.01). Cronbach's coefficient alpha (representing average in ter item correlations) was 0.82 at both the beginning and end of treatment. As a whole, the ADCS-ADL demonstrated adequate internal consistency when applied to VaD patients. Inter item correlations within the thr ee subscales of ADCS-ADL were also calculated. Cronbach's alpha was in th e range of 0.85 to 0.96, which satisfied Nunnally's criterion of 0.7 [8] for all three scales (see Table 9.5). Each scale of the ADCS-ADL also had adequate internal cons istency, that is, the instrument is a valid activity of daily living construct for VaD patients. 165Table 9.5 Mean scores for ADCS-ADL s ubscales and internal consistency measures (average intrascale correlations) at start and end of intervention period (all participants) Health scale At start (n=62) Mean score (SD) Cronbach's alphs At end (n=62) Mean (SD) activities 19.9 (5.0) 0.96 20.0 (4.8) 0.95 Domestic activities 29.4 (12.2) 0.94 29.7(12.3) 0.95 Communication activities 10.4 (5.2) 0.85 11.8 (4.9) 0.87 ADCS-ADL 0.82 0.82 9.3.4 Sensitivity Change The ADCS-ADL has not previously been asse ssed as a measure of change in activity of daily living for VaD patients following intervention. As reported in Chapters VII and VIII, both the cognitive function and quality of life improved significantly for patients receiving WNK over plac ebo. This analysis, therefore, was designed to see if the ADCS-ADL and its subscales were adequately sensitive to detect these changes in the treatment group. 9.3.5 Total mean of ADCS-ADL Independent-Sample T Test was employed to determine the mean differences of ADL between treatment groups. Although the mean total scores from baseline to Week 16 in WNK group increased 2.13, compar ed with 0.73 in the placebo group, the mean difference has no statistical significance ( P = 0.24). However, sixty three percen t of patients in WNK formulation group improved their activities of daily living as assessed by carers using ADCS-ADL, compared with 33 percent of patients in the placebo group ( X2 = 7.224; P = 0.027; Fisher's exact = 0.026, Table 9.6 ). 166Table 9.6 Improvement by treatment group - ADL Compared with before trial WNK group n (%) Placebo group n (%) P value Improved 20 (63) 10 (33) Stayed the same 6(19) 5 (17) Worsened 6 (18) 15 (50) 0.026 9.3.6 Subscale analysis of ADCS-ADL The mean pre- and post-treatment ADCS-AD L subscores in patients receiving WNK were also compared using independent sample t-tests (Table 9.7). While no significant improvement had been shown in the 'basic activities' and 'domestic activities' categories, the change in 'c ommunication activities ' was statistically significant (P< 0.01). The six items within the 'communication strongly correlated with pati ent's cognitive function. No significant differences were noted in any of the subs cales between the baseline and Week 16 in the placebo group.

In their study, ADL evaluations were based on two scal es: the Katz scale (scoring from zero to 6 for basic functions), and the Lawt on IADL scale (scoring from 0 to 7 for instrumental functions). Li vingston et al (2004) furthe r developed this subgrouping method by deriving a new instrument which measures B-ADL and two forms of I- ADL (i.e. domestic activity and communi cation activity). Our study validates this newly developed subgrouping method for ADCS-ADL in patients with VaD. Unlike the method adopted by Kurz et al ( 2003) and Livingston et al (2004), which classified patients into one of the thr ee disability clusters ('dependent', 'non- dependent, and 'non-dependent but with inst rumental functional disability') based on 168their scores on the basic, domestic a nd communication ADL, our study assessed the internal consistency of the ADCS-ADL a nd of each of the three sub-ADLs. The external validity was also assessed by co mparing the three sub-ADLs against other clinical evaluations of patients. In additi on, the sensitivity of ADL was evaluated to reveal which of the three sub-ADLs is the most sensitive to the changes of cognitive function. The new subgrouping scheme of ADCS-ADL has been demonstrated to have adequate internal consistency and both construct and concurrent validity when applied to patients with VaD. The total ADL score has not shown a statistically significant improvement, although a time effect trend was noted in favour of active group. The percentage of patients who experienced improvement was higher in WNK group than those in the placebo gr oup. The ADCS-ADL appears adequately sensitive to cognitive change in VaD patie nts, although within the limitation of only one subscale - 'communication activitie s'. This improvement had also been confirmed by changes in cognitive score - ADAS-cog as reported in Chapter VII. The 'communication activities', game' and are associated closely with main domains of cognitive impairments in VaD patients. 'Basic activities' and 'domestic activities' were unders tandably less sensitive to cognitive change, as they measure more physical symptoms than mental symptoms. It appears the subgrouping scheme of AD L is a valid measure of assessment of activities of daily living for patients with vascular dementia. 169One reasonable explanation of why the 'bas ic activities' and 'domestic activities' have not been improved may be that th e WNK formulation was experimentally designed to treat the cognitive impairment associated with VaD but was not designed adequately to successfully address the root causes for most patients as viewed by Chinese medicine. Consequently, some symp toms or activities of daily living were not improved at the same time as the cognitive impairment. Larger sample size and longer treatment duration may be needed to produce comprehensive improvements of activities of daily living for patients with VaD. The present study was performed using validated instruments and trained investigators in a representative cohort of patients in Australia, from urban, suburban and rural areas. Thus, it may be possible to ge neralise the results to the whole of the Australian population. However, a number of possible limitations exist. The cohort of patients who volunteered to take part may be a part icularly motivated and, therefore, unrepresentative group. And also, the patients were generally at the mild and moderate end of clinical presentati on. The ability of the ADCS-ADL to reflect changes in the daily activities of severe cases of VaD remains to be established. In addition, bias may be introduced as thos e who did not speak English were not included in the study as they could not be interviewed. 170_____________________ CHAPTER X A SPECT Study: Changes of Cerebral Blood Flow ______________________________ ____________________________ This chapter reports on a cerebral perfusi on study, involving the application of Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (99mTc-HMPAO SPECT) to detect potential neurological changes in treatment wi th WNK as compared with placebo. 10.1 Introduction Single Photon Emission Computed Tomogr aphy (SPECT) is a nuclear medicine tomographic imaging technique using gamma ra ys. It is very similar to conventional nuclear medicine planar imaging using a gamma camera. However, it is able to provide true three dimensional (3D) information. This information is typically presented as cross sectional slices through the patient's brain, but the image can be freely reformatted or manipulated as required. SPECT scan can be used to complement any gamma imaging study, where a true 3D representation can be helpful, e.g. tumour imaging, infection (l eukocyte) imaging, thyroid imaging or bone imaging. Because SPECT scanning permits accurate loca lisation in 3D space, it can also be used to provide information about loca lised function in internal organs. e.g. functional cardiac or brain imaging. 171Brain Cerebral Blood Flow imaging Usually the gamma emitting tracer used in functional brain imaging is 99mTc- HMPAO (hexamethylpropylene which emits gamma rays which can be detected by a gamma camera. When it is attached to HMPAO, this allows 99mTc to be taken up by brain tissue in a manner proportional to brain blood flow, in turn allowing brain blood flow to be assessed with the nuclear gamma camera. 10.2 Why SPECT scan? Blood flow in the brain is tightly coupled to local brain metabolism and energy use. Hence, the 99mTc-HMPAO tracer is used to assess brain metabolism regionally, in an attempt to diagnose and differentiate the different causal pathologies of dementia. A meta analysis of many reported studies sugge sts that SPECT is superior to clinical examination and clinical criteria (91% vs 70%) in being able to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from vascular demen tia (Bonte et al, 2006) .This reflects the capacity of SPECT in imaging of local me tabolism of the brain, in which the patchy loss of cortical metabolism seen in multiple strokes differs clearly from the m ore even or 'smooth' loss of non occipital corti cal brain function t ypical of Alzheimer's disease. Although structural imaging is undoubtedly the investiga tion of first choice to perform in the assessment of patients w ith vascular lesions, both to exclude some other intracranial cause for the cognitive impairment and to confirm the presence of vascular change, SPECT can have a useful role in some cases (O'Brien et al, 1992). 172Read et al (1995) compared results from SPECT scanning against neuropathological diagnosis and found SPECT could demonstrat e abnormalities due to ischemic lesions not seen on structural imaging. So, at th e present time, it is probably sensible to reserve SPECT as an investigation to use when information from structural imaging is not definitive enough to confirm or refute a diagnosis of VaD. 10.3 Study design 10.3.1 Objective The objective of this study is to observe the changes of Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) after comparing the treatment of WNK and the placebo. 10.3.2 Study design During the course of the clinical trial, all participants in the present study were invited to participate after explaining the nature, risk and benefits of the study. CBF imaging with 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT was performed on participants at baseline assessment and after the 16 Week treatment. 10.3.3 Outcome measure The primary outcome measure is changes in CBF in various brain regions between WNK and the placebo groups at end of treatment. 17310.4 Statistical Analysis Patients enrolled in the study were offered brain perfusio n imaging before and after treatment to assess changes in CBF. Patie nts were assessed by a nuclear medicine physician then inj ected with 1000MBq Tc99m-exametazime (HMPAO, Ceretec\u00ae, Amersham Health, Sydney, Australi a) at rest in a quiet, darkened room. The patient remained recumbent for at least 30 minutes to allow for uptake of radiopharmaceutical and clearance of scal p blood-pool activity. Images were then obtained over 30 minutes using a Siemens MultiSPECT-3 triple-head gamma camera (Siemens Medical Systems, Hoffman Estate , Il. USA) with high resolution fan beam collimators, 128x128 matrix, 64 stops, 25 seconds/stop. Images were checked for motion by the technologist and then reconstr ucted using filtered back projection and attenuation corrected using Chang's Method (1978). The reconstructed images were aligned on the occipitofrontal line and displayed using MedView software (MedImage, Ann Arbor, Il. USA). Images were also normalised, mapped onto the Talairach stereotactic brain space, compar ed to normal, age-specific databases and overlayed onto a standard brain Magneti c Resonance Imaging (MRI) using the Neurostat software package (Dr Satoshi Minoshima, University of Washington Medical School, Seattle, Wa, USA). The normalised, co-registered pre- and post- treatment images were compared within ea ch of the treatment and control groups and a t-score of the change computed for each point within the brain for each group. Finally, the t-score changes we re compared between groups. 17410.5 Results Nineteen participants agreed to participate in this st udy. One participant withdrew from the study due to non completion of the post treatment SPECT scan. Among the 18 participants, eleven were in the pl acebo group and seven in the WNK group. The effort required in terms of additional visits and the actual scanning process itsel f were distincentives to other participants. Due to variablity in each SPECT sca n, we summed the 11 SPECT scans in the placebo group and 7 SPECT scans in th e WNK group respectively to reduce the noise and the variablility of different scans. The statistica l results (t-score data) of SPECT was displayed on Talairach stereota ctic brain space by deforming each point of change in SPECT scan onto standard brain MRIs using specialised software. Within the treatment group there appeared to be relatively increased blood flow in the inferior frontal and anteri or temporal regions bilaterall y, more marked on the left (see Figure 10.1). The difference was statis tically significant t > 4.5 (P < 0.000003). The apparent increase in the brainstem was seen in both the treatment and placeb o groups and may be an artefact. 175 Figure 10.1 Difference in the changes of cerebral blood flow between pre- and post-treatment in the WNK group (n = 7), t-scores > 4.5 (p<0.000003). The red colour repre sents the increases in CBF. The increase in blood perfusion, particularly on the left of brain is also seen in the difference in t-scores (t > 4.5, P < 0.000003) between the WNK and placebo group (Figure 10.2). The red colour re presents the increases in CBF.

The red colo ur represents the increases in CBF. 17610.6 Discussion and Conclusion Previous studies ha ve reported that 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT provides a valuable contribution to the clinical di agnosis of VaD and can be a us eful tool to differentiate VaD from other types of dementia (Neary et al, 1987; Burns et al, 1989; Waldemar, 1995). However, the degree of sensitivity and specificity provided by the use of 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT for detecting CBF change s after intervention in patients with VaD remains to be clarified. This is the first study to have tested the extent to which 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT contributes to the detection of change of VaD after intervention. Moreover, it has provided the pattern of CBF abnormality in VaD patients, which suggests that 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT may be a useful outcome measure for VaD. The study found that there appeared to be si gnificantly increased blood flow in the inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions bilaterally, more marked on the left in WNK group, compared with placebo group. Th e result of CBF increasing provided further evidence to support that the CHM fo rmulation WNK may be effective in the management of VaD. These findings are also largely consistent with the results of previous CBF SPECT studies (Neary et al, 1987; Burns et al, 1989; Waldemar, 1995) that have shown anterior, temporal \"patchy\" CBF changes in VaD. VaD is characterised by cognitive impairments, caused by cerebral vascular diseases. The cognitive impairments in VaD patients include memory, orientation, recognition, registration, attention and language. The frontal lobe of the human brai n is associated with behaviour, attention, 177intellect, emotions, planning, reasoning, and pa rts of speech; and the temporal lobe is associated with auditory, visual and ot her memories, recognition of stimuli, and speech. The CBF changes in the two br ain areas correspond to the cognitive dysfunction in VaD patients . This indicates that 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT has reflected the changes of CBF, which is correlated with cognitive func tion measured by the ADAS-cog. The ADAS-cog has been demonstrated as a valid outcome measure for cognitive function associated with VaD. Therefore, the significant changes and the specific pattern of CBF abnormality provide strong evidence that 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT has adequate sensitivity and specificity for measuring the changes of VaD after intervention. A potential limitation of this study is that th e diagnosis of 'probable' or 'possible' VaD was based on the clinical and ne uroimaging evidence - the NINDS-AIREN criteria rather than gold st andard neuropathological criteria , raising the possibility of diagnostic misclassification. However, th e NINDS-AIREN criteria are the most commonly used diagnostic criteria in clinical research with high sensitivity an d specificity and relatively cost effective to apply. An expert panel, consisting of geriatricians, neurologists a nd neuropsychologists were re sponsible for the diagnosis of VaD patients, and tried to recruit more 'p robable' rather than 'possible' patients. Out of the 18 participants, 16 were 'proba ble' VaD patients. These have made the diagnosis more accurate. Furthermore, th e patterns of CBF abnormality are in agreement with those of findings on patient s classified on neuropa thological criteria (Read et al, 1995). 178 Our study shows that 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT is a sensitive tool for detecting CBF change and provides a useful outcome measure for VaD. Moreover, the pattern of CBF abnormality is specific to VaD, and prov ides a guide to the clinical usage of CBF imaging in the differential diagnosis of dementia. WNK appears to be able to improve the CBF and metabolism in the br ain regions which are responsible for cognitive functions in VaD patients. 179__________________ CHAPTER XI General Discussion ________________________ ________________________ 11.1 Overview The first part of this study (Chapters I to IV) provides all necessary background information and rationale for the studies c onducted in this proj ect, and established that VaD is a common dementing disorder for which there is no reliable medical treatment. Chapters I and II describe VaD, its epidemiology, social and economic impact, and summarise its current management strategy. A review of the literature on the treatment of VaD was also undertaken wh ich concluded that there is currently no effective western medicine treatment for c ognitive impairment asso ciated with VaD. Effective, safe and cost effective alternat ive approaches are, therefore, urgently needed. CHM, which has been used for the treatment of ageing related disorders for centuries, may be an excellent source of such therapies. By reviewing the clinical trials of CHM fo r VaD conducted in the west as well as in China, Chapter III focused on the assessm ent of methodological issues including study design, randomisation, blinding, sample size, diagnostic criteria, outcome measure and trial length. Whilst a body of good, quantifiable clin ical evidence has 180been accumulating and the qua lity of clinical trials has been improving over the years, significant methodogical problems remain. These include: Poor or inappropriately described randomisation, Lack of attention to blinding, No placebo controlled or use of another Chinese medicine whose effectiveness has not been evaluated by RCTs, No data on compliance or completeness of follow up, No side effects reported, Poorly defined outcome measures, Weak statistical analysis, and Publication bias. Chapter IV summaries the data of the pr eclinical studies of WNK formulation, a three herb formula developed by the Pharm acology and Experimental Centre at Xi Yuan Hospital, China Academy of Chines e Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. A series of preclinical animal studies conducte d by the research team demonstrate that WNK improved learning and memory function associated with VaD, and appeared to offer a neuroprotective effect in general dementia. The safety of this formula has also been proven in the toxicity studies. These results indicated that further clinical studies are required to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the formula in VaD patients. The purpose therefore of Part Two of this thesis was to further gather the scientific clinical evidence of CHM formulation WNK in the management of VaD through a well designed RCT. In particular, it aimed to: 181 Evaluate the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine fromulation WNK in the treatment of VaD, Determine whether the widely used quality of life health survey SF-36 can be a valid outcome measure for CHM trials on VaD, Investigate the efficacy of WNK on qual ity of life and activities of daily living in VaD patients, Investigate the efficacy of WNK on the brain blood flow in VaD patients, and Monitor the safety of WNK in VaD patients. By addressing all the issues emerging from Part One, Chapters V and VI tried to produce a robust clinical trial protocol according to RCT principles and to assess its suitability for studying TCM and other co mplementary medicines. The methodology of this trial was designed to address the main issues identified in the review of clinical trials of Chinese medicine in VaD described in Part One. The trial fulfilled key requirements of randomisation, double blinding, and placebo control. Chapters VII - IX discussed the main fi ndings on cognitive functions measured by the ADAS-cog and MMSE, activities of dail y living by ACDS-ADL, and quality of life by SF-36 health survey. Whilst the MMSE was previously validated and widely used as an outcome measure for VaD clin ical trials, other parameters including ADAS-cog, ACDS-ADL and SF-36 health survey were, for the first time, validated as outcome measures in VaD clinical trial of CHM in the present study. 182It has been long argued that there had been no objective and quantifiable efficacy parameter for the measurement of cognitive functions in clinical trials of Chinese herbal medicine in VaD. Chapter X tr ied to fill this gap by employing the 99m Tc- HMPAO SPECT scanning to measure the ch anges in CBF in response to herbal medicine interventions in VaD. It is the fi rst time SPECT scan had been used in such a trial. The data collections in this study took approximately two years to complete due to several reasons. The treatment and follow up periods comprised eight months for any individual patient. Recruiting the full quota of patients took in excess of one year. This, in part, was because the inclusion and exclusion criteria fo r participants were very strict and required significant medi cal screening to exclude any potential confounding diagnosis and concurrent disord ers. All participants had to undergo neurological and neuropsychological examinations, blood tests, and confirmed diagnosis by medical specia lists. In addition, selecting herbal formulation, planning, research designing, obtaining ethics approva l, preparation of herbal products and placebo, and Clinical Trial No tification (CTN) to the Au stralian Therapeutic Goods Administration consumed many months of th e pre trial organisation. Data analyses also took longer than anticipat ed to complete especially the analyses of the SPECT scan data, which required specialised expertise and computer software . 11.2 Chinese Herbal Medicine and VaD 11.2.1 Does Chinese medicine have any effect on VaD? The cohort examined in this clinical trial re presented mild to moderate su fferers from the overall VaD population. All patients recr uited had suffered VaD for more than 183three months and were prepared to be subjected to significant medical testing, to participate in a relatively long clinical tria l and to contribute substantial time for the completion of the measurement instrument. The present study showed that the CHM formulation WNK is effective in the management of cognitive impairment and general health related to VaD. Patients receiving WNK formulation demonstrated significantly improvements of the ADAS- cog and the SF-36 Health Survey scores th an patients receiving the placebo. Thus, the first and third hypotheses (WNK shows greater improvement in cognitive function and general health of VaD patients respectively) are accepted. The patients' activities of daily li ving (as assessed by ADCS-ADL) were not significantly better in the WNK group when compared to the patients in the placebo group although a trend towards improve ment in WNK group was observed. Moreover, more patients in the WNK group experienced improvement than in the placebo group. The second hypothesis (WNK offers improvement in patients' activities of daily living) is, therefore, partially rejected. One of the possible reasons for this observation is that the sample si ze in the current study might be too small and/or the intervention period might be too short. It is also possible that ADCS-ADL may not be sentitive enough to detect the di fferences in activitie s of daily living in VaD patients. The fourth hypothesis (patie nts treated with WNK showed improvement in Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) detected by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT) is accepted. Brain SPECT scanning showed that the CBF significantl y increased in the inferior frontal and 184anterior temporal regions bilaterally, in patients receiving WNK when compared to those from the placebo group (P < 0.01). This observation has provided hard and solid evidence to support that WNK ma y improve cognitive function which is consistent with the ADAS-cog findings. Although the results of this study can not be extrapolated to all VaD patients in general clinical practice, our findings s upport further investigation of WNK as an alterative treatment for VaD. 11.2.2 Mechanisms of action underlying the observed effects of WNK on VaD Whilst the total scores of the ADAS-cog and the SF-36 have demonstrated positive effects in WNK, subscale analysis on bot h parameters was performed to further explore the specific domains which WNK interventions would act on. The data would help us to understand the mechanism of actio n underlying the e ffects of the formula. Of the ADAS-cog subscales, significant improvements were noticed when compared to the placebo group. The 'word recognition' scores failed to reach statistical significance, although a positive tr end was noticeable. On the other hand, after 16 weeks treatment of WNK, there was no improvement in the two subscales 'constructional praxis' and 'i deational praxis'. These results indicated that the formula may have more effects on memory and language related cognitive functions than movement or visual processing functions. 185Comparing the mean scores of the SF-36 s ubscales before and after the intervention, we found that three subscales including 'm ental health', 'role emotion', com ponent scores' were significantly improved in WNK group, while only the 'role physical ' in 'physical component scores' was significantly improved in the domain of physic al health. The results indicate that the CHM formula selectively improved mental heal th rather than physical health in the VaD patients. All these results of ADAS-cog and SF-36 are consistent with the findings from the SPECT scanning which demonstrated that there was significant increase of blood flow in the inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions bilaterally, more marked on the left in WNK group, compar ed with the placebo group. As we know, the brain is divided into regions that c ontrol specific functions. The frontal lobe of the human brain is associated with emotions, planni ng, reasoning, behaviour, at tention, intellect, and parts of speech; and the temporal lobe is associated with auditory memory, visual memory and other memories, recogni tion of stimuli, and some language and speech. In the current study, the improvements in brain function, as reflected by the increases in CBF, were limited to the frontal and temporal regions which mainly control the functions of in tellect, emotion, memory and language. We therefore conclude that WNK contribut es to the management of VaD mainly by improvements in the function of memory and language. As stated previously, WNK was devel oped based on the TCM principles of 'tonifying qi and promoting blood circulation, bene fiting intellect and strengthening brain'. VaD is characterised by cognitive impairments caused by strokes. Cognitive 186function refers to memory, recognition, or ientation, emotion, and intellect etc. Stroke, in modern medicine, is caused by anything that stops blood flowing into brain. This can be a blood cl ot in artery (ischemic str oke) or blood leaking out of artery walls (haemorrhagic stroke), which are all called blood stasis in TCM. Qi, vital energy of the human body, has a clos e correlation with blood. It can not only promote the blood circulation but also keep blood flowing in the blood vessels. WNK addresses the internal cause - cer ebral vascular disease by 'tonifying qi and promoting blood circulation', and at the sa me time treats the superficial symptoms - cognitive impairments by 'benefiting intell ect and strengthening brain'. Both the improvements of cognitive function (evide nced by the ADAS-cog) and the increase in brain blood flow (evidenced by SPECT scans) have confirmed these mechanisms. 11.2.3 Reflections on the Study It has been argued that there is no ade quate scientific evid ence to support the application of TCM. Becau se of the difference in theoretical rationales and administrative methods compared with m odern medicine, TCM practitioners and their clinical practices remain vulnerable in the western medical environment. In addition, this hurdle severely limits the in tegration of TCM with western medicine. Therefore finding the scientific evidence, fr om western medicine's point of view, is of primary importance. In the current study, capsulated herb extracts were used. This allows an application of conventional clinical tria l methodologies to evaluate it s effectiveness. The highly concentrated nature of the herbal extracts allowed a significantly reduced capsule size and quantity and thus increased comp liance with the trial. In addition, cutting 187edge nuclear medical technology, SPECT s canning, was employed in this trial, providing 'visible' , objective evidence. All this has helped to secure a successful RCT trial at a very high standard. The findings in the present study will greatly contribute to the evidence base for herbal medicines generally, and will help to clarify a way forward in herbal medicine research for the management of VaD. 11.2.4 Limitations of the Study A potential limitation of this study is that th e diagnosis of 'probable' or 'possible' VaD was based on clinical and neuroimagi ng evidence - the NINDS-AIREN criteria - rather than gold standard neuropathological criteria. This raises the possibility of diagnostic misclassification even though th e NINDS-AIREN crite ria are the most widely used diagnostic criteria in clin ical trials with highest sensitivity and specificity. Another limitation relates to how broadly the findings of th is clinical trial can be extrapolated to the general VaD populat ion. Although the patients came from relatively diverse locations in New South Wales, the representation of the VaD general patient's cohort may be limited due to the relatively small sample sizes. A s described in the inclusion and exclusion crit eria, patients with severe VaD, aged less than 60 or over 85, or with comorbid c onditions such as severe depression and mental retardation etc were excluded in the current trial. Consequently, the results of this study may not be able to address the occurrence of rare adverse events, nor should they be generalized to all patients seen in general clinical practice. To address this issue, an international multi centre RCT trial with a greater patient number, improved statistical power and possibly l onger interventions is still needed. 188At the time of completion of this thesis, a human bioavailability study was being undertaken to determine the availability of active constituents from the herb formulation in the plasma from patient s receiving WNK. This study will provide further evidence to support the use of WNK in VaD and help to explore the mechanisms of action underlying the observe d clinical effects in the present study. 11.3 Scientific Implicat ions of the Study This thesis demonstrates that it is feasible to evaluate TCM using a rigorous and scientific methodology identical to what is being used in western medicine trials, without compromising its practice prin ciples. In addition, some new medical diagnostic technologies can help to add value to the clinical trial. Findings of this thesis indicate that TCM may offer genuine benefits when integrated appropriately into a modern healthcare environment. Of importance, by exploring other traditional medical approaches this thesis high lights strengths and weaknesses of a complementary medical practice. This thesis addresses an important issue that CHM formulation may offer substantial benefits to some serious disorders with a polypathophysiological mechanism. As discussed before, WNK is a complex herbal formulation that is designed to address the internal causes as well as to trea t external symptoms The selection and combination of multiple herbs in the formula was guided by the principles of TCM and conventional pharmacology and phytoche mistry. The modern extraction and fractionation processes were employed in processing the herbs. The proximal dose ratio, dosage regimen and mechanism of acti on of the formula were determined in a series of preclinical studies using various pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 189animal models. Once the efficacy and safety of the formula were confirmed in the preclinical studies, clinical studies followed to further evaluate clinical effectiveness in VaD patients. Mixtures of multiple active constituents in an herbal formula could help to address various aspects of a disease. This multi target approach, which is part of the essence of traditional Chinese medicine, is obviously different from the modern western medicine which is in favour of the single target approach. The current study together with the preclinical studies surrounding the development of WNK formula have helped to construct a subs tantial body of evidence to support the use of herbal medicine in VaD and clarified a way forward for herbal medicine in the treatment of other major diseases. 190__________________ REFERENCES Access Economics.

We (ie the investig ators) hope to assess the effectiveness of this formula in a randomise d, control clinical trial. You were selected as a possible participant in this study becau se you are aged 60 years or above and have suffered from vascular dementia for at least 3 months. Vascular dementia (VaD) is a major cause of mental and physical disa bility in the aging populations of the western countries. It is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and accounts for 15-2 0% of all cases of dementing disorders. Treatment of vascular dementia is curren tly based on the recognition and control of vascular risk factors. Chinese herbal medicine has a documented history of use in the treatment of dementia-like disorders and could provide a safe and cost-effective treat ment. Outline of the procedures: You firstly will be screened by a medical prac titioner based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. If eligible, you will be re quired to sign a consent form to enter the study and be randomly assigned to receive the Chinese medicine herbal formula or placebo (an inactive substance) in capsule fo rm. You will take one capsule three times daily by mouth for 4 months. During this time, you will attend the trial cen tre at the Bankstown-Lidcome Hospital on a regular basis (at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months). At thes e visits, relevant clinical assessments will be conducted by participating geriatrician s or neuropsychologist s to check on your progress. A follow-up assessment will also be performed at 8 months. Benefits: The herbal medicine may help to relieve the symptoms associated with VaD. However, we cannot and do not guarantee or promise that yo u will receive any medi cal benefits from this study. As a participant, you will have the pleasure of knowing you are contributing significantly to the development of a safe and cost-effective treatment for the VaD. If, at the end of the study, there is shown to be a benefit from the Chinese herbal medicine then all those participants who were taking the placebo will be offered four months of Chinese herbal medicine free of charge. 216Risks and Discomfort All three herbs used in this formula are li sted with the governme nt regulatory body, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) as safe and suitable for human consumption. These herbs are currently available over the counter to the public throughout Australia. However, there is a remote possibility that some participants may develop an allergic reaction to these herbs such as skin rashes or liver or renal toxi city. Other minor side effects such as nausea and gastro-intestinal disc omfort may occur. During the entire trial, all participants will be closely monitored by the chief investigators and the partic ipating clinicians.

Mey, root Clinical indications: Prostration with impending coll apse marked by cold limbs and faint pulse, diminished function of the spleen with loss of appetite, cough and dyspnea due to diminished f unction of the lung, thirst due to impairment of body fluid, of diabetes caused by internal heat , general weakness with irritability and insomnia in chronic diseases, impotence or frigidity, heart failure, cardiogenic shock . The effects of Ginseng on the Central Nervous System include the followings: 1. Effect of the activity of the higher nervous centre: stim ulation and inhibition of the higher nervous activity, minimizing the rate of errors in code transmissions by telegraph operators and enhanced their decoding ability, improving the mental efficiency and concentration power of writers and aged persons. 2. Effect on brain electrical activity: the ginsenosides i nhibits behaviour and brain activity, inhabits electro en cephalic wakening reaction. 3. Sedative and tranquillising effects: GNS, isolated from the crude neutral saponins of ginseng (GN3) , produce not only sedati on and tranquilisation, but also analgesic, music relaxant, and antipyretic effects. 4. Influence on the monoamines: Low dosage of the dried aqueous extract of ginseng significantly increased dopami ne and norepinephine, but de creased 5-HT in the brain stem. It also increased cerebral 5-HT, ade nyl cyclase activity as well as the amount of inorganic phosphates. It promoted the penetration through the blood-brain barrier of 14C labelled phenylalanine, which is the precursor of biological amines in the brain and is essential for learning and me mory. However, high dosage of the extract lowered adenyl cyclase activity in the cereb ral cortex and brain stem, and markedly reduced the amount of camp in the brain stem. Contraindications: Incompatible with Rhizoma et Radix Veratri. It should not be prescribed in cases of excess syndrome and heat syndrome without deficiency of the vital qi. Adverse effects: Mild irritability and excitation were observed in persons who took 100 ml of 3% ginseng tincture ; 200 ml of the tincture or large doses of ginseng powder could result in intoxi cation giving rise to rise spots, pruritus, headache, vertigo, hyperpyrexia and bleeding, the last symptom being the characteristic manifestation of acute intoxication incl uded by ginseng. Over dosage of ginseng in persons of strong constitution could resu lt in breathlessness, chest discomfort and abdominal distention. Radish has b een used as a folk remedy for ginseng intoxication. Prolonged oral use of more than 0.3 g of ginseng powder might lead 239to insommia, depression, headache, palp itation, hypertension, diminished sexual function and weight loss. Dosage : 3-9g. Toxicity: The LD50 of the oral administra tion of the powdered root of P . ginseng in mouse was higher than 5g/kg. The acute LD 50 of substaneous ginseng extract in mouse was 16.5ml/kg. After oral ad ministration of 100,250, and 500mg/kg og ginseng for a month, the subacute toxicity tests showed no abnormality. The acute LD50 of the various fractions of ginseng or its ginsenosides by intraperitoneal injection in mouse showed that Rf and Rg1 which contained panaxatriol, and Rb1 which contained panaxadiol and glucose as its sugar moiety are less toxic. 2. YING XING YE - Ginkgo biloba L., leaf Clinical indications: Atherosclerosis of coronary arteries, hypercholesterolemia, chronic bronchitis, and Parkinson disease. Extracts of Ginkgo biloba have been used for symptomatic treatments of mild to moderate cerebrovascular insufficiency (dementia syndromes in primary degenerative dementia, vascular dementia , and mixed form of both) with the following symptoms: memory deficit, di sturbance in concentration, depression emotional condition, dizziness, tinnitus, and headache. 2 Contraindications: none noted. Adverse effects: its preparation has mild side effects. Occasional dizziness, headache lassitude, xerostomia, dry and red tongue, chest discomfort, gastric discomfort, loss of appetite, abdominal di stension, constipation, or diarrhoea may occur, but generally they don't affect the completion of treatment . Dosage: 3-5g. Toxicity: Daily injection of shuxue ning to dogs at doses 10 or 40 times the human dose for one week produced gastrointest inal symptoms in cluding salivation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and impaired appetite. Histological examination revealed hypersecretion of the small intestinal mucosa. Local injection of this agent may cause vascular sclerosis, in flammation and organised thrombosis, but no abnormalities were observed in the bl ood picture and liver function tests. The flavones of YINXINGYE did not cause a ny morphological change s in the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and arteries during subacute experiments on rabbits, guinea pig, rats, and mice. 3. XI HONG HUA - Crocus sativus L., Stigma Clinical indications: Coronary disease, thrombotic di sease, menstrual disturbance, wounds and decubitus ulcer, miscellaneous. Contraindications: it is contraindicated in pregnant woman. Furthermore, it should be used with caution in patients with pe ptic ulcer or haemorrhagic diseases. Adverse effects: Generally, there is no significant a dverse reaction, but a minority of patients may develop dizziness, skin erupti ons and transient urticaria. In treatment of verruca plana, transient aggravation of local lesions may occur in some patients, which usually disappears quite ra pidly. Attention must be drawn to the incidence of a slight increase in menstrua l flow in some woman after medication. Dosage: 9-10g . 240Toxicity: the MLD of the herb decoction in mice by intraperitoneal injection was about 1.2 g/kg. The LD50 of the alcohol extr act in mice by intravenous injection was determined to be 5. 3g/kg. The LD 50 of carthamin in mice by intravenous injection was 2.35 \u00b10.14g/kg, whereas its safety dose by mouth was >8g/kg. The 50% C. tinctorius flower injection instille d into the eyes was not irritating to the conjunctiva. The drug had no haemolytic actio n in vitro. No toxic effect or death was observed in mice given the intraper itoneal injection at the dose of 12.5g/kg for two days. Young rats given feeds with carthamin, 0.015-1.5g/kg every day by mouth for 3 months, did not show signifi cant changes in the blood picture, liver and kidney functions, nor any morphologica l abnormalities in the heart, liver, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract.
