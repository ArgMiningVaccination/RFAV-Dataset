The healing and prevention techniques used in naturopathic medicine can include clinical nutrition, physical manipulation, botanical medicine or supplements, hydrotherapy, acupuncture and homeopathy just to name a few, by integrating conventional, scientific and empirical methodology with the ancient laws of nature.
