As Erin mentioned last month, I will temporarily be stepping in to run the Wildlife Austin Program until we hire someone permanently. Erin has done an amazing job with the pro- gram and so I would like to continue offering the same ser- vices and resources to you all. The newsletter may be of a slightly different format but I hope you will all bear with me while I get into the swing of things. I would also like to send a special congratulations to our newest class of Habitat Stewards. We had a total of 16 graduates this semester complete the month long training. They are now certified through The National Wildlife Feder- ation and will be volunteer leaders in their own communi- ties. I am so excited and proud to have them added to our ever-growing group of Habitat Stewards. Finally I would like to wish you all a Happy Cinco de Mayo. I hope that you all can find some time to relax and enjoy your friends and family. Please check out the Fiestas Patri- as-Cinco de Mayo event found in this newsletter as well as the many training and lecture opportunities. 2 Saturday, May 18 8:30am -4:30pm - Na- tive Plant Walk at Doe- skin 4:00pm to 5:00pm - Watershed Walk at Tarrytown Park (Watershed Protection Dept.) - http:// www.austintexas.gov/ event/watershed -walk Tuesday, May 7, Library: May 15, 6:00pm, SFC at the Triangle: Thursday, May 16, Manchaca Road Library Saturday, May 25, 9:30am, SFC Farmer's Market Downtown- Wednesday, May 29, 6:30pm, City Hall Protecting Your Pets and Wildlife By Julie Webber As spring turns to summer here in Austin, breeding sea- son for many species of local wildlife is well underway. Fledgling birds and other young animals face many challenges on their road to adulthood, and are often more prone to predation than adult wildlife. We can help them mature safely by making sure our pets do not become those predators. Keeping your pets indoors is safer for both your pet, and for wildlife. Did you know?... -Outdoor pet and feral housecats kill hundreds of millions of birds, plus billions of small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians every year in the United States. -Well -fed outdoor cats still hunt. Cat feeding stations do not prevent wildlife predations. -Research involving surveys of cat owners, analysis of fecal samples, and \"KittyCam\" camera monitoring data has shown that while some outdoor cats do not hunt at all, most cat owners underestimate the number of animals killed by their outdoor cats. -Cats do not need to go outdoors to be happy - providing proper stimulation and play indoors can keep your cat active and healthy while satisfying its instinct to hunt. -Many people believe that allowing cats to hunt outdoors is an excellent way to control pest rodent species. In reality, outdoor cat colonies are associated with higher proportions of exot- ic invasive house mice and lower proportions of native rodent species than areas without out- door cats. -While exact numbers are unknown, estimates ranging from thousands to millions of outdoor cats are hit by cars every year. -Outdoor cats are prone to dangerous interactions with wildlife and with other outdoor pets or feral domestic animals. This can lead to injury and transmission of potentially fatal diseases like feline leukemia, feline immunodeficiency disorder, and rabies to your pet. -Most research on wildlife -pet interactions has focused on cats, but dogs can also be problem- atic for wildlife. Keep your dog safe from coyotes and cars (and keep wildlife safe from your dog!) by not allowing your dog to roam outdoors at home, and by respecting on -leash areas on public property.

Her garden features many unique solutions to providing shelter for wildlife as well as water and places to raise young. Su- sanne also incorporates many native plants, including Eastern Redbud, Texas Bluebonnet, Texas Lantana, and Yaupon. She also used the stump of an inva- sive tree species to create a birdbath stand. Susanne's garden is a great exam- ple of thinking outside the box when trying to incorporate all the habitat ele- ments in your yard. Thank you Susanne for some great ideas! 4 Nacho Party Cheesecake Prep: 25 min.

VOLUNTEER TRAINING IN- VASIVE PLANT SPECIES MONITORING Saturday, June 8, 2013 - 8:30am - 4:30pm The City of Austin and the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Cen- ter's Invaders of Texas Program have partnered to train local volunteers on invasive plant species identification and monitor- ing. Volunteers will work with city staff to develop a base map of where invasive plant species are located on City lands, and that information will be used to prioritize sites for treatment or re- moval of invasive plant species. This is the first of four workshops to be held during the spring and summer of 2013. The goal is to train 180 \"citizen scientists\" who are willing to dedicate at least 20 hours of service during the summer monitoring season.
