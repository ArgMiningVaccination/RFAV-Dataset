The [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/en-us/Pages/Default.aspx) (AAP)\u2014an organization of 66,000 pediatricians committed all children\u2014wholeheartedly endorses the recommended [vaccination schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/index.html) created by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Despite this, many believe that vaccinations are unnecessary, or even dangerous. [Micah Resnick, MD](http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/micah-resnick), a board certified pediatrician at [Mount Sinai Doctors Queens](http://www.mountsinai.org/locations/queens), explains why vaccines are safe and critically important. Misinformation about vaccination is prevalent. Poorly conducted, debunked studies claim vaccines cause autism, and well-meaning but ill-advised parents assert that too many vaccinations are administered. If you have concerns about vaccinations, I encourage you to talk to your child's health care provider. Get your questions answered. Feel comfortable. Then, get your child vaccinated. Here are the facts: overwhelming scientific evidence supports the safety of vaccines. Children who, for whatever reason, are not vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases are at risk for those diseases. Unvaccinated children also pose a significant risk for children who are medically exempt from receiving vaccines. Those medically exempt include immunosuppressed children who may be receiving chemotherapy, and children who have a severe allergy to a vaccine component or have another immunosuppressive condition. When almost all children receive vaccines for vaccine-preventable diseases, herd immunity\u2014a form of indirect protection from infectious disease\u2014is achieved. Essentially, when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, a measure of protection is provided for individuals who are not immune. What happens when we do not achieve herd immunity? Preventable outbreaks. In 2015, a measles outbreak started at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. As a result, more than 100 people contracted the extremely contagious disease. According to AAP's statistics, more than 3 percent of kindergartners in California claimed a non-medical exemption for vaccination at the time of the outbreak. Of those who came down with measles, 83 percent were either unvaccinated or of unknown vaccine status. Forty percent of the cases were in children too young to receive the vaccine, so without herd immunity, these children remain vulnerable. We must all do our part to protect our families, our neighbors, and our fellow citizens. There are some side effects to vaccines\u2014tenderness at the vaccination site, mild fever, fussiness, and even a high fever which may prompt a visit to your pediatrician. But the side effects are temporary. By contrast, contraction of a vaccine-preventable disease can result in permanent disability. For example, though rare, infection from mumps can cause deafness. A parent's best defense is vaccination. I may sound like a bit of a scold here, but it is a reflection of how strongly I feel about helping you protect your children. During visits, I encourage parents to follow the CDC vaccination schedule. I answer their questions and highlight resources like the CDC's \" [For Parents: Vaccines for Your Children](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/visit/index.html)\" and this [FAQ](http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4025.pdf).
