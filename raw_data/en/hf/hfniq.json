I was recently asked what crystals are not only [safe for children](https://www.therapy-directory.org.uk/blog/2018/08/02/safe-complementary-therapies-kids) but could also help them in their daily lives. The great thing is, there are many crystals that are suitable for children. The following guide is an introduction to some of the best healing crystals for children. Which are the best healing crystal for children? Amethyst Amethyst is a calming crystal that can really help children sleep better and prevent nightmares. It's often popular with children because of its purple colour. You can place a crystal underneath their pillow or by the bed, and make up a 'Magic Spray' for younger children. Simply fill a bottle with water and a few drops of [lavender essential oil](https://www.therapy-directory.org.uk/articles/aromatherapy.html), and add an Amethyst crystal in too. Spray this around the room just as they are going to bed. Moonstone Moonstone is really good for children who are dealing with emotional issues or are hyperactive. Your child can simply hold the crystal or rub it on their forehead - you will find that they will instinctively use the crystal where they need it. Rose quartz Rose Quartz is definitely a stone every child should have. It has such a gentle, loving energy that it helps children overcome hurt and soothe their emotions. It is also gentle enough for children to wear for longer periods of time in bracelets, as a pendant or to carry in their pockets. Tiger's eye Tiger's eye a great grounding stone that brings daydreamers back to reality and into the present moment. It is also a great stone for helping children with their self-esteem and can promote courage, too. Tiger's eye can be carried in their pocket, but I would recommend that they don't carry it all the time - daydreaming is important too! Green aventurine Green aventurine is known as the 'good luck' stone, so would be perfect for children sitting tests or exams or needing some encouragement. It is also a stone of leadership and, therefore, excellent for shy children and helps all children to show their leadership qualities. Sodalite This deep blue stone is a great calmer and can help children think more clearly. It is a useful stone for any student, and taking this to school or placing it where your children do their homework will help them to focus. Clear quartz Clear Quartz is known as the 'Master Healer' and really is a must for anyone's collection. It acts as an all-purpose healer and can, therefore, be useful in many situations. Children seem especially drawn to this crystal and can often spot small rainbows within its structure. If you're looking for more information on crystals to support children with specific behavioural challenges or for help with their emotional well-being, read our article, [Crystals for children's mental health](https://www.therapy-directory.org.uk/blog/2021/05/30/crystals-for-childrens-mental-health). Why are children drawn to crystals? Kids of all ages have a natural attraction to crystals - they can be drawn to their energies, their beauty, colour and form. Children experience the subtle energies of crystals quite easily and this can help them to understand and process the world from a grounded perspective. It's important to allow your child to choose the crystal/s that they feel are right for them. Make sure that any crystals your child chooses are tumbled, as this will help prevent pieces from breaking off. I would also advise that new crystals (and those that have been used for any length of time) are [cleansed](https://www.therapy-directory.org.uk/therapist-articles/using-the-full-moon-and-other-methods-to-cleanse-your-crystals) in clean water to recharge them. Get your kids involved in this part too - mine love 'washing day'!
