One of the first sustainable agriculture movements, it treats soil fertility, plant growth, and livestock care as ecologically interrelated tasks, emphasizing spiritual and mystical perspectives. Proponents of biodynamic agriculture, including Steiner, have characterized it as \"spiritual science\" as part of the larger anthroposophy movement. In spring 2104 the herb crib started a vegetable garden using biodynamic practices and principles. We created a diversified balanced farm ecosystem which now also includes the herb and woodland gardens. Biodynamics is a step above organics working with biodynamic preparations and indications for planting, cultivating and harvesting. These allow you to work with the life forces that increases the physical health of your soil, plants and animals. "}
