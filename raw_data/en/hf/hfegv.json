She knows that nature is healing, she's been ignoring the calls of her body because of the everyday pressures on her to keep the household going, to keep others happy, and she's beginning to see that she needs a little support to connect that little bit deeper to herself. She's on a journey into all things natural, and she wants to make sure she can get her fix of something a bit more Soul-rejuvenating, nurturing and medicinal - but at the moment she doesn't have much time. And so, she's looking for remedies she can use 'on the go' - quick fixes, if you like, which will help her to navigate her busy life (although, really, she knows there's no such thing as a quick fix - the holistic path and the journey to becoming a true Medicine Woman is deep work). Is that you? We've got you - in today's blog we want to share some blends and recipes for the medicinal ones who are feeling the stresses and strains of running around this December trying to create a Christmas that's going to be the best festive season ever - especially after the lack of Christmas last year. And, as the inner Medicine Woman's gifts are healing, wisdom, and wildness - and usually these are the gifts she ignores, which has her running around staying busy, we will cover on-the-go essential oils for healing (body, mind and soul), blends for dealing with being over-worked and under nurtured and not following your wisdom, and blends for cultivating your connection with your wild this season. On the go blends for healing your Medicine Woman Often, the medicine woman feels the stresses and strains of holding together a busy life - and usually, she first notices these in her mind, feeling anxiety, stress, low mood, irritability, or the like. This commonly is a sign she has been ignoring the dull aches and pains of her body for a long time, numbing their calls, and possibly even feeling quite exhausted. And, of course, all of this, is actually a deeper sign she has been ignoring the calls of her Soul, which actually wants her to slow down. So, whilst we share tips here for our quick fix options for December, the deeper invitation is to really begin to listen in to that urge to find a 'quick fix' and begin to listen to the deeper call of your medicine woman. The first step, though for now, is to embrace the medicine of the wild - i.e. essential oils, which come from plant extracts - to help you begin to tune in more deeply. Healing blend for the mind To begin healing a busy, stressed mind, which is feeling the anxiety, low mood, irritability and strain of modern-day life, create a pulse point rollette to take out and about with you so you can incorporate essential oils into your daily life: De-Stress Pulse Point Rollette: Add 1 drop [Bergamot](https://www.baseformula.com/bergamot-essential-oil) and 1 drop Valerian to 10ml Grapeseed oil in a [rollette bottle](https://www.baseformula.com/blue-glass-rollette-bottle) and use it on your pulse points throughout the day when your mind needs relaxing. Healing blend for the body To create healing for a tired body, with aches and pains, create a massage blend for after your shower in the morning and use it as a body oil: Body Reconnection Oil: Add 3 drops [Lavender](https://www.baseformula.com/lavender-french-essential-oil) (or Sweet Marjoram if you don't like the scent of Lavender), 2 drops Sweet Orange and 1 drop Basil to 15ml [carrier oil](https://www.baseformula.com/carrier-oils) and apply to your body in gentle, slow, massaging strokes in a direction towards the heart. Healing blend for the Soul If you're resonating with this blog, your Soul is likely calling you deeper into slowing down, which is why I suspect you're looking for quick fixes because you're rushing through life and feeling the pressure of that. To begin to tune in a bit deeper to what you really need, create a Soul Spritz: Soul Spritz: Mix 15 drops [Neroli](https://www.baseformula.com/neroli-essential-oil), 10 drops Frankincense and 5 drops Myrrh in 100ml [Orange Flower Hydrolat](https://www.baseformula.com/orange-flower-neroli-hydrolat) in a spray bottle and use this spritz throughout the day to just tune back into yourself. The medicine you need right now is to tune in a little deeper to why you are rushing; create a few minutes at a time through the day to just close your eyes, inhale the scent and listen into what your Soul really needs. On the go blend for nurturing your wisdom We've already addressed the stresses and strains of the mind, but let's go a bit deeper. The real reason you're likely here reading this is that you're feeling over-worked, spending a lot of time in your head and under-nurturing your wisdom. You've been so busy looking after everyone else that you're now feeling stressed and exhausted, and you're likely not even tuning into your deeper wisdom. So, the deeper invitation is to slow down and create some time to tune in to hear the whispers of your intuition. Your Medicine Woman is calling you to stop rushing with the Quick Fixes and allow yourself to grant you permission to slow down and tune into your wisdom. This blend will help you to do that: Blend for slowing down Diffuse 3 drops Patchouli, 2 drops [Cedarwood](https://www.baseformula.com/cedarwood-atlas-essential-oil) and 2 drops Sandalwood in an aromatherapy diffuser or candle burner wherever you are during the day - if you're out and about, pop one drop of each oil into an [aromatherapy inhalator](https://www.baseformula.com/aromatherapy-inhalators). Use it with the intention of granting yourself permission to hear your wisdom. On the go blend for rewilding your Medicine Woman Finally, much of our challenge in today's modern world is that we are human animals disconnected from the wild - and that's why aromatherapy can be so healing as it brings the wild back in. When we rush around, we deny ourselves our natural, medicinal state of being both in nature or in our wild natural state, and so essential oils can help us reconnect. It is good to use essential oils to remind our bodies of what they are meant to be doing - i.e, right now, we are in the winter phase of the wild cycles of the seasons, we are in the Christmas season of the year, we are in the dark phase of the year. And so, we can remind ourselves of this, with essential oils to rewild us back into life's natural cycles - which will help our bodies feel more reconnected. Blend for seasonal rewilding Create a massage blend of 3 drops [Cinnamon](https://www.baseformula.com/cinnamon-leaf-essential-oil), 2 drops Pine, and 1 drop Ginger (substitute with Sweet Orange if you don't like the scent of Ginger) mixed in 15ml [Grapeseed oil](https://www.baseformula.com/grapeseed-carrier-oil) and use it as a massage oil as and when needed - you could just pop it into a bottle and use it throughout the day on various parts of your body, massaging in a direction towards the heart. This will help rewild you into the natural cycles of the season, bringing nature to you, even if you can't go to it. The deeper invitation is always to slow down, of course - your inner Medicine Woman is calling you more deeply into that; but whilst you're in the rushed world, and especially the most busy season of the year, use our simple, quick fix blends to bring some rewilding to your self - body, mind and Soul.
