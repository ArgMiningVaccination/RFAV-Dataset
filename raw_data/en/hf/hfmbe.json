(U) The Computer Exploitation and Human Collaboration thrust is expl oring the fundamental science of interconnected systems to prov ide powerful mathematical tools for understanding the intrinsic proper ties and complexities of large-scale networks and other distr ibuted systems. This foundational research is imperative for the future design of robust systems that break away from the established tradition of piece-meal patching of current infrastructures. The security of the nation de pends on interconnected systems, such as data networks for t he warfighter, the power grid, telecommunications systems, social and organizati onal networks, economic and financial systems and command and cont rol structures. These networks can suffer dramatic failures. Such failures can potentially be prev ented or controlled through a f undamental, quantitative understanding of the intrinsic prope rties of networks and development of ma thematical tools. Additionally, deeper scientific foundations for what might be called \"netwo rk understanding\" will eventually generate dramatic new capabilities for the DoD whi le at the same time generating benefits for civ ilian applications. Overall, the research will provide vastly expanded power and improved inte raction for a wide range of military tasks and environments. Currently the research is focused on the development of an overarching \"Information Theory for Wireless Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks\" (ITMANET). If this revolutionary kind of information theory can be developed, it will yield n ew mathematical tools applicable to other in terconnected systems, offer practical guidan ce for developing the next generation of t he DoD's wireless networks, and moreover provide insight concerning the ac quisition and deployment of nearer-term systems. (U) Research on machine intelligence over the l ast two decades has revealed that many r easoning problems are inherently computation ally complex, and in many cases, intractable. Solutions to these probl ems typically require either enormous computer resources, or simplification of the problem resulting in major sacrifices to accuracy. The Real-W orld Reasoning Thrust (REAL) is developing foundational techn ologies, heuristic approaches, and tools necessary to enable effective, practical machine reasoning about increasingly complex and large -scale problems. These technologies will aid commanders and warfighters in assessing th e consequences of specific ac tions and strategies, and wi ll help in predicting future results. The key technologies under investiga tion are effective, practical inferential reasoning in real-wor ld situations with complexity and uncertainty; novel paradigms for learning while reasoning; integration of multip le reasoning paradigms; represen tation and reasoning with information that changes over time; reasoning about the goals of other agents; and appropriate metrics for measu ring cognitive behavior and performance. 14UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA1 Basic Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Defense Research Sciences PE 0601101E, Project CCS-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 2 Page 15 of 32 (U) Advanced research in innovative computer architectures is requi red to develop a new generation of unique processor designs and hardware architectures that exploit advances in ultra-high performance proces sing to support DoD applications. Mainstream commercial co mputer architectures are, by necessity, both incremental and constrained: incremental so that existing corporate investments are not t hreatened, and constrained so that legacy business applicati ons continue to run on the latest computer s. From a commercial perspective, this interactive design approach makes economic sense, but it has negative security rami fications. The DoD's increasing reliance on commercial hardwar e has had the unintended consequence of \"leveling the playing field\" with our adversaries. This effort will explore a new generation of proc essing architectures and critical functionality that could even tually provide revolutionary advances in processing capabilities, performance, and pr oductivity thereby ensuring the U.S. continues to lead in computer architecture comp onents that will form the foundations for the next wave of hig h performance embedded computing. (U) Another area of research will take a fresh look at the design and implementation of cognitive architectures modeled after human cognition, combining principles from neuroscience and cognitive psychology with traditional artificial intelligence-based symbolic processing and knowledge representation. These efforts will dr aw on advances in neurophysiology and co gnitive psychology to guide and augment traditional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to learning, reasoning, memory, knowledge acquisition and organization, and executive f unctions. Designing software inspired by the brain's processing schemes can o ffer leap-ahead advances in cogn itive systems. This work ha s the potential to revolutionize a broad range of military applications through breakthrough performance of intelligent machines. (U) Program Plans: Developed new machine learning algorithms that resulted in eff ectively doubling performance of personal cognitive assistants.

Nanoscaled lasers would be useful in a wide range of applicatio ns, from close integration with electronics, on chip light sources, to single photon sources. The program idea is b ased on recent developments in heterostructured semiconductor na nowires (the gain medium), which establish the feasibility of forming lasers with di ameters much smaller than the wavelength of light they produc e. Simultaneously, advances in plasmonic structures, which support op tical frequencies with x-ray like wavelength, make it possibl e to envision feedback structures (cavities) that are also shorter than th e wavelength of light emitted from the cavity.

These technologies will enable our critical system s to provide continuous correct operation even when they are attacked. The technologies will also lead to generations of stronger protecti on, higher performance, and more cost-effective security and sur vivability solutions scalable to several thousand sites. Technol ogies developed under this project will be exploited by all the projects within thi s program element, and those in the Command, Control, and Communications program elem ent (PE 0603760E), the Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element 0603764E), the Sensor Technology program element ( PE 0603767E), the Guidance Technology program element (PE 0603768 E), and other programs that satisfy defense requirement s for secure, survivable, and network centric systems.

Sophisticated computing capabilities currently available in desktop workstation and serve r systems are moving to mobile wireles s embedded systems that communicate over low bandwidth self-organizing tactical networks. As a result, the spectrum of devices the U.S. m ilitary must protect is increasing from wired and wireless tactical and garrison computers to include a wide array of small mobile devices. With foreign production of information technolog y components increasing and adversaries seeking to leverage cyber warfare as the Achilles' h eel of current and future U.S. military systems; the U.S. military must have the ability to withstand, operate through, and counter increasing ly effective cyber attacks while reducing the manpower required. Other distinct pr ograms within this project will be created to pursue promising technologies as they are identified for further focused deve lopment.

Narrative Title FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Spread Spectrum Networking 0.000 2.900 5.000 4.000 (U) Spread spectrum communication technology will significantly improve security against a variety of network attacks and identific ation profiles by spreading energy over a broad bandwidth, thereby provi ding an adversary with a signal which is both difficult to de tect, as well as difficult to jam without using significant resources. This pr ogram expands these same goals, by addressing not just the physic al layer but also the entire network stack. Similar to frequency-hopping spread spectrum, the approach of this program is to develop and demonstrate algorithms that provide hopping between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and then expanding to hopping between diffe rent permutations of layer 1-3 protocols. The utility is to provide significantly im proved security against a variety of netw ork attack and identification profiles.

MANETs are composed of interdepende nt nodes based on interdependent system layers. Each node exposes tens to hundreds of configurable parameters that must be continuously adapted due to variable tactical factors such as mission profile, phase, force structure, enemy activity, and environmental conditions. The comple xity of this high-dimensional, adaptive, constrained, distr ibuted network configuration problem is overwhelming to hum an operators and designers and has root causes in the historically wireline-oriente d networking paradigms. Today's commercial trends are not aimed at supporti ng the DoD's extreme deployments or unique applications. This p rogram will take on the ambitious goal of researching a novel protocol stack th at supports integrated optimiza tion and control of all netwo rk layers simultaneously. Key technical challenges include scalable desi gn, stability, and convergence. These challenges are particular ly difficult in a distributed setting with partial and uncertain information, hi gh communications overhead, and high probability of link failure. To address this problem, the CBMANET program will exploit recent optimization-theo retic breakthroughs, recent info rmation-theoretic breakthroug hs, and comprehensive cross-layer design to develop a network stack fro m first principles with specific attention to support for DoD ap plications such as multicast voice and situation awareness. (U) Program Plans: Design and develop novel protocol architecture from first pr inciples in information theory and optimization theory. Design and demonstrate protocols based on network coding that vastly improve performance in extreme conditions. Design and demonstrate cross-layer protocols and adaptive cont rol capabilities to drive resource allocation more efficiently. Design novel control interfaces to support DoD-relevant app lications such as multicast and situation awareness. Design appropriate interfaces between the nove l network stack and the physical radio platforms to support cross-layer optimizat ion. Perform quantitative analysis and trade st udies to understand the degree of performan ce offered by the novel network stack. Research the requirements for a radio hardware plat form to optimally support the novel network stacks.

Today's military software systems are brittle in the face of changing 47UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 16 of 26 requirements. They are vulnerable to skilled attackers who de velop creative and unpredictable strategies, and are increasingly dependent on software produced in and/or \"outsourced\" to potentially hostile nations. Misconfiguration accounts for most security failures in internet services and poses a serious risk to military systems. This program w ill develop security aware systems that will avoid brittleness and vulnerability, due to their ability to reason about their own security attributes, capabilities and functions with respect to specific mission needs. These systems will also dynamically adapt to provide desired levels of service while mi nimizing risk and providing cohere nt explanations of the relativ e safety of service level alternatives. These systems will bolster the reliability a nd security of critical open source software systems by reduci ng vulnerabilities and logic errors, and providing state-of-the-art software analysis techniques augmented with cognitive decision-making techniques w ith the ultimate goal of applying these systems on to the Global Information Grid. The Security-Aware Sy stems thrust consists of two programs, Applications Communities (AC) and Self Regenerative Systems (SRS). The Application Communities (AC) program is a major effort funde d within the Security-Aware Systems program. The program will develop technologies to protect DoD information systems that empl oy commercial software applications against cyber attack and s ystem failure by developing collaboration-based defenses that detect, respond to, and heal with little or no human assistance. The p rogram will leverage advances in information assurance research programs to create a new generation of self-defending software that automat ically responds to threats, and provides a comprehensive picture of secur ity properties, displayed at multiple levels of abstraction a nd formality. This capability will bring intelligent security adaptation to DoD systems and make secur ity properties and status more apparent to decision makers. AC technology will enable collections of similar syst ems to collaboratively generate a shared awareness of security vulnerabilities, vulnerability mitigation strategies, and early warn ings of attack. AC will revolutionize the security of mili tary information systems and reduce the threat from stealthy intrusion of critical systems and/or denial of service attacks. The Self-Regenerative Systems (SRS) program will design, develop, demonstrate and validate architectures, tools, and techniques for fielding systems capable of adapting to novel threats, unanticip ated workloads and evolving system configurations. The technol ogy development of this program will employ innovative techniques like biologically-inspire d diversity, cognitive immunity and heal ing, granular and scalable redundancy, and higher-level functions su ch as reasoning, reflection and learning. These technologies wi ll make critical future information systems more robust, survivable and trustworthy. The SRS program will also develop technologies to mitigate the insider threat. The program will combine the SRS technology foundations in an exemplar milita ry system that learns, regene rates itself, and automatically improves its ability to deliver critical services over time. SRS-enabled systems will be able to rec onstitute their full functional and performance capabilities after experiencing accident al component failure, software error, or even an intent ional cyber- 48UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 17 of 26 attack. These systems will also show a positive trend in re liability, actually exceeding in itial operation capability and appr oaching a theoretical optimal performance level over long periods while main taining robustness and trustwor thiness attributes. This prog ram was formerly funded under PE 0602304E, Project COG-01. This move re presents a consolidation of in formation assurance activities. (U) Research efforts within this thrust will explore two additi onal areas. The first is research that addresses vulnerabilities, m issions and threats in computer abstract-model reasoning. Resulting technol ogy will enable current systems to generate vulnerability repor ts ranked by probable impact of a failure/attack on the mission. This would include developing a cognitive agent that understands the struc ture of a defending system and its mission, hypothesizes goals of attackers, and gene rates plans on-the-fly to maintain mission success. A second area will explore practical advanced software engineering technology for building fl exible systems that allow new features to be added via \"inter position\" between existing features, with guaranteed levels of reliability and security. (U) Program Plans: Developed an Application Community (AC) system archit ecture and demonstrated an initial working prototype. Demonstrated community-enabled learning of program behavioral c onstraints which can be used to protect and repair software systems. Develop techniques to collaboratively dia gnose and respond to problems (e.g., attacks or failures that threaten a mission) in g roups of military systems. Develop techniques to summarize security policy and status so the descriptions produced by AC can be understood without omittin g critical details. Develop static and dynamic source code analysis techniques (e.g ., data- and control-flow-based techniques, model-checking, stro ng typing) to relate software module structures and runtime stat e with the representation of security properties/configurations. Demonstrate self-explanation techniques in which systems explain their critical security properties and status in a manner that is understandable to a variety of managing so ftware components and human operators. Develop test and validation regimes to assess the protection mech anisms of security products a nd certify protection to quantifi able levels based on a scientific rationale. 49UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 18 of 26 Develop measures to quantitatively characteriz e various dimensions of security (availa bility, integrity, c authe ntication, and non-repudiation), and intr usion tolerance and demonstrate the theory's relevance by applying it to a reali stic exemplar system.

Narrative Title FY 2006 3.000 5.000 (U) Multiple Access Control (MAC) protocols drive the performance of wi reless ad hoc networks by allocating radio frequency (RF) ch annel access among competing users. Traditional MAC approaches, however, provide limited RF bandwidth efficiency and network scalabi lity resulting from a lack of knowledge of the RF environment or dynamic low-le vel network parameters. Existi ng MAC algorithms attempt to acc ount for the information gap by making worst-case assumptions of RF channel, transceiver, modem, and network parameters rather than adapting to the actual situation, leading to network inefficiencies. (U) The objective of the SuperMAC program is to design MAC algorithms that use \"right-case\" instead of worst-case assumptions to ac hieve greater than an order magnitude improvement in wireless ad hoc ne twork performance. Many of the unknown RF environment paramet ers actually can be measured directly and derived from higher-level ne twork parameters. SuperMAC algorithms will attempt to exploi t this by dynamically measuring observable parameters , such as RF propagation delay, link margin , modem state change time, and number of network neighbors, of the radio transceiver and the environment.

This program will also reduce peak network loads by timing downloads to occur at low network use periods. This program will use devel oped protocols and equipment to know the network's condition at any time and only tran sfer files when network traffic is low. In addition, this program will allow th e network to provide files before the users need them, shorteni ng their wait for data. It will also allow users with periodic access to attach to the network and receive all the files the system expects them to nee d based on past activities, reducing the network's communications load. (U) Program Plans: Develop a scalable architecture for efficiently publishing metadata on a world-wide distributed content network. Develop network and routing discove ry software that pinpoints routi ng and communications' bottlenecks.

The technologies and systems developed in this pro ject will enable our military to automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a varie ty of means. (U) Current U.S. military operations involve close contact with a wi de range of cultures and peoples. The warfighter on the ground needs hand-held, speech-to-speech translation systems that enable co mmunication with the local population during tactical missions. Thus tactical applications imply the need for two-way (foreign-language -to-English and English-to-fo reign-language) translation. (U) Because oadcasts, web-posted content, an d captured foreign-language hard-c opy documents can provide ins ights regarding local and regional events, attitudes and activities, la nguage translation systems also contribute to the development of good strategic intelligence. Such applications require one-way (foreign-language-to-English) transl ation. Exploitation of the resulting tran slated content requires the capability to automatically collate, filte r, synthesize, distill, and present relevant information in timely and relevant f orms.

For example, the program will add a two-way translation capability a nd will include Arabic dialects spoken in Iraq (the current Ph raselator uses only Modern Standard Arabic). (U) Program plans: Performed mission needs analysis and aggr essive initial language data collection. Developed two-way translation systems (English and Iraqi Ar abic) based on recent military tactical language needs. Developed and evaluated a two-way spoken English-Iraqi Arab ic communication device for Stability and Support Operations. Develop new two-way translation software technologies for inser tion into, and enhancement of, the two-way Iraqi systems. Develop and evaluate two-way tran slation technologies for Farsi. Develop tools for rapid deployment of new languages and dialects. Develop two-way translation systems in other languages (other than Iraqi Arabic) to enable the user to not only translate words but to communicate and carry on limited conversation.

The Global Autonomous Language Exploitation (GALE) program will develop and integrate technology to enable automated transcrip tion and translation of foreign speech and text along with content distillation. The Multilingual Automatic Docu ment Classification, Analysis and Translation (MADCAT) program will develop and integrate technology to enable exploitation of captured, foreign language, hard-copy documents. At present the exploitation of foreign language speech and text is slow and labor intensive. GALE will provide, in an integrat ed product, automated transcription and translation of foreign speech and te xt along with content distillation. When applied to foreign la nguage broadcast media and web-posted content, GALE will enhance open-source intelligence and local/regional situational awareness and eliminate the need for translation and subject matter experts at every military site where such information is obtained. Thus, GALE will also reduce the military manpower requirements for translators a nd mitigate the escalating need for trained support personnel. GALE will 54UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-04 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 23 of 26 tightly integrate multidisciplinary research and produce prototype systems. Earlier DARPA work in foreign language processing yielded an initial integrated architecture concep t for speech transcription, text transla tion and information distillation resulting in near edit-worthy text. Continuing work under GALE will produce a fully mature in tegrated architecture and dramatically improve transcription an d translation accuracy by exploiting context and other clues. GA LE will address unstructured speech such as talk show conversati ons and chat room communications, and develop timely, succinct reports and alerts for commanders and warfighters. Hard-copy documents, including notebooks, letters, ledgers, annotated ma ps, newspapers, newsletters, leaflets, pictures of graf fiti, and document images (e.g., PDF files, JPEG files, scanned TIFF images, etc.) resident on magnetic and optical media captured in the field, may contain important but perishable information of great poten tial value to the warfighter. Th ese documents often contain mac hine printed and handwritten text in various combin ations and orientations in one or more languages. Unfortunately, due to limited human resources and the immature state of applicable technology, our military does not currently have the ability to exploit, in a ti mely fashion, ideographic and script documents that are either machine printe d or handwritten in Arabic or Chinese. MADCAT will address this need by producing devices that would enable soldie rs to convert such captured documents to r eadable English in the field. MADCAT wi ll substantially improve the applicable technol ogies, in particular document analysis a nd OCR/OHR (optical character recognition/o ptical handwriting recognition), tightly integrate these with translati on technology, and create technology demonstration prototypes f or field trials. (U) Program Plans: Global Autonomous Language Exploitation -- Designed and documented a GALE architecture based on the i ndustry standard Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA). -- Created architectural components that combine the output of multiple machine translation engines. -- Identified workflows of all processing engines and provided integr ation of these workflows on top of the architectural foundati on. -- Developed an integrated approach where the problem is viewed mathematically as a single system, with foreign speech/text as input, and English text and distilled information as output. -- Evaluated GALE translation engines on the Arabic and Chin ese languages for structured and unstructured speech and text. -- Improved translation capabilities, reducing the translati on errors by a factor of 2 in the first year. -- Evaluated distillation technologies, reaching the first year targets by exceeding 50% of human performance. 55UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-04 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 24 of 26 -- Developed a plan for a utility study to ev aluate the effectiveness of the end-to-end system relative to a baseline search engin e, and performed a preliminary study of the evaluation methods. -- Develop methods to optimize the parameters of speech-to-text acoustic models such th at transcription errors are minimized on th e training data. -- Develop discriminative training algorithms to op timize word alignment and translation quality. -- Develop methods for porting t echnology into new languages. -- Implement an integrated search of speech-to -text transcription and machine translation. -- Perform design and feasibility experiments for extraction-empow ered machine translation, wh ere the system extracts the meaningful phrases (e.g., names and descriptions) from foreign la nguage text for highly accurate translation into English. -- Integrate metadata extraction into the speech-to-text components. -- Develop the architecture for a distillation system that incor porates adaptive filtering, focused summarization, information extraction, contradiction det ection, and user modeling. -- Evaluate translation and distillation technologies a nd meet the high quality goals set by the program. -- Transition technologies developed by the GALE program into hi gh-impact military systems and intelligence operations centers.

The technol ogy will allow computational systems to have reasoning and lear ning capabilities and levels of autonomy far beyond those of today's systems. With the ability to reason, learn and adapt, and with facilities f or self-awareness, these systems will know what they are doing, enabling new levels of capability and powe rful new applications. (U) Military operations since the end of the Cold War illustrate th at current theater-level command, control, communications, and intelligence/information systems lack the ab ility to fully support operations in comple x, time-critical environments. Warfight ers must be prepared for operations ranging from conflic t and peacekeeping in urban centers to heavy ba ttle actions in remote areas. Current capabi lities do not provide the commander with real-time, secure, si tuational awareness or the ability to orchest rate high-tempo planning, rehearsal, and e xecution. The programs in this project are developing and testing innovative, secure architectures and tools to enhance information processin g, dissemination, and presentation capabilities. The programs provide the commander in sight into the disposition of enemy and friendly forces, a joint situational awareness picture that will improve planning, decision-making, and execution support capability, as well as secure multimedia i nformation interfaces and software assurance to the warfighter \"on the move.\" Integration of collection ma nagement, planning, and battlef ield awareness are essential elements for achieving battlefield domin ance through assured information systems.

The next generation of comp uter systems will rely upon reasoning, learning, and self-m onitoring to handle increasingly complex tasks. These systems will be advisable, adap table and able to cope with surprise. As a result, these novel forms of computa tion will revolutionize future military systems. The Cognitive S ystems Foundations project will develop the necessary foundational hardware architect ures and software methods to facilitate learning and inferenc e capabilities that are crucial to intelligent computing. These new computing founda tions will help us move far be yond today's standard Von Neuman n computing model. (U) Cognitive systems for military applications must be robust and resi stant to both attacks and system failures. The military fac es aggressive and agile threats that have sufficient technical resources to mount sophisticated attacks using easily accessible commercial in formation systems. The pervasive nature of both the threat and its means drives th e need for systems to dynamically adapt, collect and assimilate large quantities of systems operation data, and remain robust ev en under aggressive attacks or failure c onditions. Cognitive Systems Foundations w ill enable future computer systems to be more responsible for their own configur ation, monitoring, protection and restoration to full functional and performance capabilities after an attack or failure. (U) Overall, this project seeks to make fundamental scientific im provements in our understanding of, and ability to, create more in telligent information and computing systems. Transition goals include ne xt-generation network-centric systems and platform-specific info rmation collection and processing systems in space, air, sea and land.

Current intelligent processing implemen tations depend on the use of existing numerically-based archi tectures and/or standard software architectures, and are therefore built on algo rithms and processing foundations that are potentially ill-suit ed to cognitive tasks. Architectures that more directly mirror the symbolic reasoning, learning, and perception functions of a cognitive system are ne eded to enable major advances in this area. The ACIP program will establis h core-processing capabilities that si gnificantly advance the state of the art at all implementation processing levels - modules, systems, and un derlying cognitive processing approaches, algorithms and architectur es. In order to focus and establish context for the ACIP program, ACIP will pursu e in-context DoD focused mission areas for the development of new data processing concepts. ACIP will develop implementations that sp an the areas of perception, reasoning and representation, learni ng, communication and interaction. The ACIP program will enable new classes of cognitive information processing applications that move the U.S. dramatically toward the overall goal of creating computer systems that know what they are doing. (U) Program Plans: Developed initial cognitively-based processing techniques and arch itectural approaches in Phase I and demonstrated, with initia l simulations, over two orders of magn itude improvement in performance. Evaluated initial common benchmarks, mini-a pplications, and metrics for the evaluation and comparative development of cognitive architectures.

The technol ogy developed under this program will employ innovative techniques like biologi cally-inspired diversity, cognitive immunity and healing, gran ular and scalable redundancy, and higher-level functions such as reasoning, reflec tion and learning. These technologies will make critical futur e information systems more robust, survivable and trustw orthy. The SRS program will also develop technologies to mitigate the insider threat . The program will combine the SRS technology foundations in an exemplar military system that learns , regenerates itself, and automatically i mproves its ability to deliver critical services over time. (U) SRS-enabled systems will be able to reconstitute their full functional and performance capabilities after experiencing an accid ental component failure, software error, or even an intentional c yber-attack. SRS systems will show a positive trend in reliability, actually exceeding initial operating capability and approaching a theoretical optimal pe rformance level over long time intervals. They will also maintain robustness and trustworthiness attributes even with gr owth and evolution in func tionality and performance. Th e program will explore a sel f-regenerative operating system that will automatically recover after failure or attack on its configuration files, underlying devices or appl ications; and provide core survivability functionality, programming interfaces and system services that support rapid prototyping, construction, and deployment of survivable applications.

These capabilities will make the difference be tween mission success and mission degradation or failure, e ven in the event of cyber-attack or component attrition resulting from kinetic warfare or accidental faults and errors. Systems that learn and rea son will reduce the requirement for skilled system administrators and dramatically reduce the overall cost of system maintenance. As the military moves towards a dynamic expeditionary force, it is critical fo r systems to become more self sufficient. (U) The Cognitive Computing project will develop core technologies that enable computi ng systems to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience, and to respon d intelligently to new and unforeseen events . These technologies will lead to systems with increased self reliance, cooperative behavior, the capacity to reconfigure them selves, and survivability with reduced programmer intervention. In cognitive architectures, there are three primary types of processes: reac tive, deliberative and reflective. Reactive processes respond q uickly and directly to known stimuli; deliberative processes embody what is usually known as \"thinking;\" and reflective (higher-order) processes allow a system to \"step back\" and evaluate the environment and its own capabilities to deci de the next appropriate course of action. Each of these pro cesses will be improved through learning. Individual t echnical capabilities developed in this proj ect include novel representations for knowl edge, skill learning, algorithms for automated reasoning (deductive, abductive, planning , strategic inference, and hybrid approaches), pattern detect ion capabilities, and language learning. Overall, the project will extend fundamental computing capabilities to deal with real-world information com plexity and uncertainty. (U) The machine learning, reasoning, and human-machine dialogue techni ques developed in this project, in particular, in the Integra ted Cognitive Systems program, have great applicability to command a nd control systems and are budgete d to begin transition to batt lefield systems in FY 2008. Candidate systems include the Army 's Command Post of the Future (CPOF), th e Navy's Composeable FORCENet and the Air F orce's Air Tasking Order Programs.

Due to DoD/ military reductions in manpower levels, and in spite of the integration of advanced information technologies and automa tion throughout defense systems, the work load on the war fighter steadily increases . Modern computing systems, though powerful, are woefully lacking in th e capability to self-configure, adapt, and learn, i.e., they lack even rudimentary intelligence. This deficiency places a heav y burden on the warfighter to operate and maintain the very information technology on which modern warfare depends. The Integrated Cognitive Systems thrust will develop advanced technol ogy to enable a new class of cognitive s ystems capable of assisting military commanders and decision makers. This thru st will build upon prior DARPA programs that developed improved human- computer interaction capabilities and highly-responsive computing syst ems. Integrated cognitive systems will be able to plan a head and understand the world well enough to plausibly anticipate future events. Most importa ntly, these systems will have embedded lea rning capabilities that will allow them to retain prior learned knowledge, apply this knowledge to new scenarios and ultimately provide faster and more effective assistance. Overall, the ability to learn will enable the performance of a cognitive sy stem to improve over time. The Integra ted Cognitive Systems technologies will be developed in the Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) program. Cognitive Systems technologies develop ed in this program will be applied and demonstrated in the Incr eased Command and Control Effectiveness (ICE) program (PE 0603760E, Project CCC-01) prior to transition into Command Operations. The PAL program is creating a revolutionary technology for comma nders and warfighters - the first comprehensive system that wil l dramatically empower commanders to understa nd at a glance all aspects of the current military situation, radically reduce manpo wer and labor required in command posts and in the field, and automate th e massive number of administrative and analytical tasks charac teristic of today's command centers. The PAL program is creating a new gene ration of machine learning technology that will enable informat ion systems to automatically adjust to new environments and new user s, helping commanders adapt to new enemy tactics, evolving situ ations and priorities, accelerating the incorporation of new personnel in to command operations, and making more effective, focused use of resources. Applications developed in PAL w ill be adapted and hardened in order to be integrated into existing military systems . 68UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 11 of 28 Ultimately, future capabilities to be inserte d will enable: turning diverse, multi-sour ce data into actionable information for commanders and warfighters; dramatic manpower reductions; corporate memory retention of both the larger conflict history and the history o f each specific command center; and intelligent information presentation.

The Foundational Learning Technology thrust includes thre e programs: Real-World Learning, Integrated Learning, and Bio-Inspired Cognition. The Real-World Learning program will explore the integration a nd application of advanced machine learning techniques to further enable cognitive computing systems to learn from experience and adapt to changing situations. The program will emphasize Transfer Lea rning Techniques providing the ability to transfer knowledge and skills learned for specific situations to novel, unanticipated situa tions and perform appropriately and effectively the first time a novel situation is encountered. This is essential because most military operations occur in ever-changing environments, and U.S. forces and systems mu st be able to act appropriately and effectively the first ti me each novel situation is encountered. The program will drive the desi gn and implementation of new hybrid learning technologies, such as large- scale transfer learning, multi-purpose extensible knowledge learni ng, learning with minimal direction, learning adaptable and e fficient network structures, strategy learning, learning from text, learni ng intent of information, and learning generalized task models . The program will stress technologies that combine statistical learning techniques with knowledge tec hniques that take into account background knowledge and a priori experience. The resulting technologies will a) learn and re present vast amounts of knowledge in forms that can be applied to unknown situations and domains; b) generalize lear ned knowledge and apply it to dynam ic and unpredictable situations ; and c) reason about a situation or environment. The Integrated Learning program will create a new computer lear ning paradigm in which systems learn complex workflows from warfighters while the warfighters perform their regular duties. Current machine learning technologies cannot learn these compl ex workflows. The program is focused on military planning tasks such as air operations center (AOC) planning and military medical logistics. With this learning technology, it will be possible to create many different types of military decision support syst ems that learn by watching experts rather than relying on hand-encoded knowledge (which is expensive and error prone to produce). The new lea rning paradigm differs from conventional machine learning in that it does not rely on large amounts of carefully crafted training dat a. Rather, in the new paradigm the learner works to \"figure things out\" by co mbining many different types of learning, reasoning, and knowled ge. For instance to learn AOC tasks, the computer learner combines what it observed the warfighters doing with the knowledge it has abo ut aircraft, and reasons about airspace de-confliction to create a gene ralized model that can then be used to perform the entire A OC task, or provide intelligent instruction to other warfighters performing the same task. 70UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 13 of 28 The Bio-Inspired Cognition program has taken a fresh look at th e design and implementation of bio-inspired cognitive architectu res modeled after human cognition that combine principles from neuroscience and cognitive psyc hology with traditional artificial intelligence- based symbol processing and knowledge representation. The progra m draws on continuing advances in neurophysiology and cognitiv e psychology to guide and augment traditi onal artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to learning, reasoning, memory, knowledge a cquisition and organization, and executive functions. The work has focused on new capabilities in memory, categorization, pattern recogni tion and fusion of perceptual/sensory information to emulate human perfo rmance by exploiting past experience in novel situations, learni ng in multiple ways, fusing multiple perceptual inputs in real-time, extracting concepts from specific experiences, forming hierarchi es of associated memories and concepts, and directing attention throug h a complex executive process. Success is being measured by th e ability of the systems developed to deal effectively with novel situ ations and respond a ppropriately in reasonable timeframes.

These capabilities will enable robotic vehicles to support warfighter s in a variety of situations and terrains, including trans portation, logistics, reconnaissance, and active battle. A key obj ective is robust navigation and locomotion, since this underlies the ability to mo ve through the difficult and unpredictable terrain of theater operations, which ma y include highly irregular and mountainous areas, partially- destroyed roads, rubble-filled urban terrain, and other vehicles and personnel. This program also supports the DARPA Urban Challenge. (U) Within the thrust area, efforts are being made to develop l earning and reasoning technologies to address specific concerns in b oth wheeled and legged robotic systems. Current systems for autonomous grou nd robot navigation typically rely on hand-crafted, hand-tuned algorithms. While these systems may work well in open terra in or on roads with no traffic, performance falls far short in obstacle-rich and highly-irregular environments. In contrast, the approach ta ken here is to develop systems that automa tically learn to interpret sensor data and apply this knowledge to actuator control to improve locomotion and navigation in comp lex environments. Learning techniques will include (but not be limited to) reinforcement learning and learning from examples. These advan cements will open new horizons for unmanned military operations, surveillance and reconnaissance, and dramatically advance the capabilities of au tonomous vehicles. Tasks requiring higher-level computation , such as perception-based navigation and a high degree of freedom articulati on will greatly benefit as well. (U) Although current approaches to autonomous na vigation of unmanned vehicles have achieved notable success in recent years, they s uffer from limitations due to having been develope d for static environments and not for dynamic real-world environments. Examples of the challenges posed by a complex dynamic real-world environment include: (1) robotic vision outdoors, under windy conditions that result in t he movement of vegetation, trees, and leaves and, when a body of water is present, waves; and (2 ) path-planning in the presence of moving \"obs tacles\" such as people and other (manned or unm anned) vehicles. Improvements in robotic vi sion and scene understanding, including the capabili ty to predict the future location and even the intent of moving objects, need to be integrated with more sophisti cated approaches to path plannin g. This would set the stage for autonomous interacting robots that share informati on and collaborate in performing tasks. For example, interacti ng robots could collaborate in planning/traversing a diversity of routes and ther eby enhance their likelihood of quickly finding a viable and/o r (nearly) optimal path. 73UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 16 of 28 (U) Program Plans: Learning Locomotion and Navigation -- Explored various learning technologies that enabled rapid adapta tion by robots to new physical environments and improved autonomous vehicle speed over rough terrain. -- Developed several learning methods that a llowed learned navigation algorithms to su rpass the performance of a baseline system which was demonstrated thr ough several experiments. -- Explored \"learning from example\" and \"reinforcement learning\" applications to develop technology for autonomous vehicle systems to learn and gather experience without relying on a pr ogrammer to anticipate all eventualities.

The Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Technology thrust (f ormerly Knowledge-Based and R easoning Technology) will develop enabling technologies to acquire, integrate, and use high perform ance reasoning strategies in knowledge-rich domains.

Significant reasoning challenges arise from the fa ct that critical knowledge involves context, temporal informat ion, complex belief structures, and uncertainty. To a ddress these challenges new capa bilities are needed to extract key information and met adata, and to exploit these via context-capable search and inference (both dedu ctive and inductive). DoD systems sense, capture, and store i nformation in the form of text, audio, imagery, and video. Therefor e, advanced machine reasoning capabilities must extract knowledge from and reason about all types of multimedia data. Visual-spatial reasoni ng, which is perhaps the most powerful form of human reasonin g, yet the one least covered by machine cognitio n, is of special interest. This research w ill explore new computational models to enable command and control systems to use conceptual representations to perfo rm visual-spatial reasoning and to assist the commander in unders tanding and analyzing complex battlefield scenarios. (U) People are able to learn complex concepts, but they require a cu stomized curriculum designed to t each a hierarchy of concepts a t different levels of representation where each level depends on having learned the previous leve l. Bootstrapped Learning (BL) will provid e computers with the same capability, enabling rapid learning of complex high-level concepts. At each level, a rich set of knowledge sources (s uch as training manuals, examples, expert behaviors, simula tors, and references and specifications that are typically used by people learning t o perform complex tasks) will be combined and used to generate concepts and a si milar set of knowledge sources for the next level. Key to this p rocess is the ability to automatically re-represent these combined sources into a common representation as needed for learning and reasoning. The ab ility to perform BL is essential for autonomous military systems because they will need to understand not only what to do but why they are doing it, and when what they are doing may no longer be appropriate. To be usef ul, a military system must not only carry out the specific task/mi ssion for which it is programmed but also be able to reflect on its own ability to do so, and do this in the context of its operator/controller's int ent. (U) Program Plans: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Technology -- Developed and implemented initial di gital repository architecture. -- Develop integrated knowledge representation and learning technolo gy that enables effective representation of essential forms of knowledge. -- Develop representations of events and me thods for separating and tracking their association to merge multiple scenarios, assimilate one event within the context of the other, and identify where events deviate from the norm. -- Develop a general inference engine based on spatial representations, transformations, and reasoning techniques, in order to provide a more intuitive, common sense, human-like and efficient visual reasoner. 75UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 18 of 28 -- Create learning mechanisms for the discovery of novel object cate gories and then design, develop, and demonstrate an artificial system that is capable of context-sensitive vi sual scene interpretation and understanding.

Battles, engagements, and even peace keeping missions are won by teams of warfighte rs working in concert with each other and the automated system s that support them. These warfighters are operating in hard settin gs where action, information, and decision making are distributed and the situa tion is constantly changing. In these settings, communications, information sharing, and tools that support warfighter coordination are critical. (U) The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces Project will dr amatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable fast er, better informed, and more hi ghly coordinated actions than those of our enemies. This will be accomplished by developing revoluti onary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more c ohesive group action by our forces. Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated coordinated decision support, information sh aring, and ensured communications. Cogn itive decision support tools reason about t asks, timings, and interactions so that when plans change or the enemy does not respond as anticipated, U.S. forces can quickly adapt. The qualit y of such decisions and the effectiveness of our actions depend cr itically on our ability to take full adva ntage of all available information in a rapid and flexible manner. This requires the capability to sh are information and to automatically inte grate distributed information bases for bro ad tactical battlespace awareness. Finally, team cohesion requir es effective and reliable communication in difficult environments such as the urban se tting where radio signal propagation is complex. Here the a pproach is to develop cognitive communicati ons management and control algorithms that reason about channel conditions, higher-level application connectivity requirements and related factors, and decide (often as a group) what parameters (e.g., frequency) each radio will use. The suite of programs under th is project will significantly ad vance the military's ability to address and deal with complex situations in operational environments.

Such situations typically require multiple coord inated tasks that involve information sharing and cooperative efforts. The Colla borative Cognition thrust will foster the design and implementat ion of collaborative software agents that operate in dynamic environments that incl ude both software agents and people. Applications include collab orative surveillance and reconnaissance, logistics re-planning and decisi on support for unanticipated opera tional changes, situational analysis, prediction tools, and warfighter/commander decision aids. The technology will also allow software agents to cope with limited and/or nois y sensor information, limited communication capabilities, changing and unforeseen environments, other agents, and limited a priori knowledge of each other's capabilities. The Collaborative Cognition technology thru st consists of two programs: Coordination Decision-Support As sistants (COORDINATORs), and Advanced Soldier Sensor Information System and Technology (ASSIST). The Coordination Decision-Support Assistants (COORDINATORs) program will develop cognitive software coordination managers that provide support to fielded tactical teams. The coordination ma nagers will help fielded units adapt their mission plans in resp onse to inevitable, unanticipated changes in the mission by tracking pers onnel, resources, situational ch anges, and proposing and evalu ating options (adjustments to task timings, changes to task assignme nts and selection from pre-planned contingencies). This will ena ble fielded units to respond faster and more accurately to the dynamica lly changing battlefield situation, requiring far fewer personnel in the re-planning process. COORDINATORs is a distributed technology. A single COORDINATOR will be partnered with each tactical unit or team, and will be able to collaborate and coordinate with other tactical units to optimize needed mission changes. A key lesson learned from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) is the importance of accurate observationa l reporting by ground soldier s. The Advanced Soldier Sensor Information System and Technology (ASSIST) program will develop an integrated information system that exploits soldier-worn sensors to augment the soldier's ability to capture, report, and share information in the field.

While a range of standardized reporting mechanisms are in use today, the confusion of the battlefield/urban operations combined with ph ysical and psychological stresses on the warfighters can make the task of reportin g very difficult. Furthermore, existing verbal and text-format reports limit the soldier's ability to capture and convey the full pic ture, particularly annotated visual information. The ASSIST program will develop an integrated system using advanced technologies for processing, digitizing and analyzing information captured and collected by so ldier-worn sensors. It will draw heavily on the experiences a nd lessons learned from previous OIF missions and other surveillance and reconnaissance missions. A baseline system will demonstrate the capture of video/still images together with voice a nnotations and location-stamping. The adva nced system will demonstrate automatic identification and extraction of key objects, events, activities and scenes from soldier-collected data. The system will creat e knowledge representations that will serve as an input to an array of warfi ghter products including augmente d maps, situational analysis t ools, and query and answer capabilities.

(U) The Cognitive Networking research thrust will develop technologies that provide information systems and communication networks with the ability to maintain their own functionality, reliability and survivability. These technologies will allow the military to focus its critical manpower resources on the mission rather than on the maintenance of its information systems and network infrastructure. Resear ch in this area will create a radical new design for distributed computers, device networks, and the software to manage these systems. It will also attempt to create a \"cognitive radio\" capability, which uses cognitive information processing to op timize communications based on current conditions, past Narrative Title FY 2006 FY 2007 FY February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 23 of 28 experience and high-level user guidance. The Cognitive Networ king thrust comprises three programs: Situation-Aware Protocols i n Edge Network Technologies, Adaptive Cognition-Enhanced Radio Teams, and Brood of Spectrum Supremacy. The Situation-Aware Protocols in Edge Network Technologies (SAPIENT) program will develop a new gene ration of cognitive protocol architectures to replace conventional protocols that fare poorly in extreme network conditions a nd do not provide adequate serv ice for key applications. Technology developed in th e SAPIENT program will have military utility wherever tactical communications are depl oyed. SAPIENT architectures will represent awareness with a knowledge base that is updated based on specification and observation. T his technology enables the automatic adaptation of protocols to the operational environment. SAPIENT will exploit attributes of hu man cognition, such as learning and self-improveme nt, and apply them to the automated cons truction of network protocols. Key resea rch challenges for the SAPIENT program are the use of these cognitive a ttributes to dramatically reduce the effect of network impai rments on applications while demonstrating a positive trend in this capability as new situations are encountered and learned. Desired ca pabilities include interoperable knowledge representati ons and rapid incorporation of new knowle dge about applications, network conditions and building blocks from which new pr otocols can be constructed. The Adaptive Cognition-Enhanced Radio Teams (ACERT) program is enabling distributed radio teams that are able to use capabiliti es inherent in aggregating nodes thereby le veraging advantages that are unique to a distributed system. ACERT focuses on techniqu es to enhance basic radio capabilities by combining the information ava ilable to the individual radios and making it available to the team. Of particular interest is sharing individual measurements of the ra dio channel to derive a shared common map of the local propagat ion conditions. Such a radio frequency prop agation mapping capability can serve as the basis for improved message routing resultin g in more reliable communications for small unit operations in urban environments. The Brood of Spectrum Supremacy (BOSS) program will provide acti onable situational awareness to the warfighter in complex radio frequency (RF) environments. BOSS adds co llaborative processing capabilities to tactical software-defined radios to achieve sp ecific military goals. BOSS exploits cooperative u se of computational, communication and sen sory capabilities in a software radio, in aggregate, to generate breakthrough capab ilities in the warfighter knowledge of their surroundings, with a particular focus on RF-rich urban operations. The BOSS program will initially focus on modeli ng and simulation, resulting in hardware-independent executab le specifications of waveforms in an interoperable format. Once the modeling and simulation is verified, the BOSS program will de velop a prototype demonstration for a performer-sel ected RF platform, 81UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 24 of 28 the waveforms.

It will create software technologies that ena ble future warfighters to share information and to automatically integrate distributed information bases for broad tac tical battlespace awareness. Ul timately, the selection, generation, sharing, integration and display of information will be handle d by cognitive software systems coupled wi th each warfighter, and as information is shared the network of individual systems w ill form a collective. Information integration is one of the m ost critical and challenging problems facing the DoD and continually tops the list of critical defense needs. Th e inability to share and integr ate data and information results in a fragmented picture of the battlespace wh ere only a fraction of the available information is actually u sed. For example, it has been reported that in many instances it was easier to re-task an asset to collect ne w information than it was to retrieve c ritical information from data already collected and analyzed. Integration of multimedia (text, video, digital photographs) is of particular interest as it may contain valuable intelligence \"tidbits\" with different degrees of subtlety that can be extremely time-consuming to manually analyze (this is the case today). Once analyzed, such data needs to be indexed and stored so it can be queried and retrieved. Automatic analysis, querying and correl ation algorithms need to be developed to minimize manual intervention. (U) Current practices in the area of digital storage and information management generally optimize file storage and retrieval for t he individual but are poorly suited to the sharing of large volumes of digita l information across workgroups and enterprises. The DARPA Netw ork Archive (DNA) project is pursuing a network-based a pproach to information storage and manageme nt that will enable a network-based repos itory to hold all digital information. Because it resides on the network, th e DNA repository will provide a mechanism for the virtual (i.e., logical, not physical) centralization of all enterprise information. DNA technology will enable and facilitate controlled access to information by ap proved and authenticated users across administrative dom ains, and in this fashion it will enable a collective view of enterprise informati on. Repositories built on DNA technology will, in addition, provide a single distributed platform/framework for addi tional document/content/informatio n services including indexing, metadata creation, search, versioning, and records management, resulting in the warfighter's ability to tak e full advantage of all available pertinent information in a rapid and flexible manner. 83UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 26 of 28 (U) Program Plans: Develop a comprehensive digital repositor y architecture to enable ubiquitous access from multiple devices while providing secur e, effective, document sharing.

Not only will these approaches be more eff ective against known pathogens, they also promise to offer sub stantial protection against unknown pathogens including engineer ed pathogens and emerging pathogens from th ird-world environments. An emphasis is on the discovery and development of technologies that will allow a rapid response (within weeks) to unan ticipated threats, whether the y are naturally encountered emerging diseases or agents from intentional attack. A variety of approaches will be developed to accelerate the c apability to rapidly produce needed therapeutics for our warfighters in weeks rather than years. This pr ogram has a goal of radically transforming the protein design process by researching and developing new mathematical and biochemi cal approaches to the in silico design of proteins with spec ific functions. By determining the structure of a specific protein that binds with a specific pathogen, the manufacturing process for therapeut ics will be greatly reduced. This program is also developing an interactive and f unctional in vitro human immune system using tissue engineering. This \"immune system\" will be able to test the efficacy of vaccines against th reat agents that, at the present time, can only be tested in an imal models, thus significantly decreasing the time needed and increasing the probab ility of success for biological warfare vaccine development. An additional focus is the development of entirely new technologies that will allow the rapid, cost-effective manufacture of complex therapeu tic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccine antigens. (U) Program Plans: Developed in vitro fabrication of three-dimensional tissue constructs, bioscaffolds and bioreactors. Develop technologies for nano-imprinting viruses that racapitu late the antigenic structures of the native virus. Develop approaches for on-site battlefield synthesis of small molecule therapeutics, including antibiotics. Develop technologies to allow rapid, inexpensiv e assessment of radiation exposure in humans. Develop and demonstrate an integrated in-vitro immune system th at will emulate the human immune response in order to provide a means of evaluating new BW vaccines and therapeutics. Demonstrate the ability to predict known vaccine immunogenicity in humans solely by testing in the artificial immune system. Develop and validate new in vitro systems to predic t toxicology of vaccines and immune modifiers. Develop a technical framework for the synthesis of milli ons of doses of a protein therapeutic within 12 weeks.

(U) The overall goal of DARPA's Handheld Isothermal Silver Standard Sensor (HISSS) program is to develop a sensor that is capable o f detecting the entire biological warfare threat spectrum (bacteria , DNA viruses, RNA viruses and protein toxins) with the same \" silver standard\" specificity as current laboratory techniques, but in a fast, relia ble, handheld unit. Today, this standard is achieved for DNA and RNA threats using polymerase chain reaction, which is slow because of the associated temperature cycling. For proteins, the standard is met usin g Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), which requires skilled laboratory t echnicians to complete. The equipment required for these tests is bulky and difficult to use under field conditions. Under HISSS, DARPA will de velop fundamentally new ways to exploit previously develope d identification mechanisms (DNA and RNA primers, protein an tibodies) in an integrated, isothermal sy stem that will allow a single, handheld sen sor to detect the full range of BW threats. (U) The Spectral Sensing of Bio-Aerosols (SSBA) program involves th e active probing of bioaerosols with electromagnetic (EM) energy , which holds the promise of extremely fast, and potentially long-ra nge, detection and identification of bio agents. Only a smal l portion of the EM spectrum is exploited in today's trigger sensors (e.g., optically based particle sizers, sometimes enhanced with fluorescence m easurements). 90UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Biological Warfare Defense PE 0602383E UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 5 of 12 However, anecdotal evidence suggests that other portions of the spectrum may offer substantial improvement in trigger sensors, as well as potentially agent-specific discrimination capability. Various types of spectra in the visible, infrared, and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths are being measured for prototype systems development. Additional spect ral information such as UV fluorescence lifetime and single partic le mass spectroscopy is also being evaluated. DARPA is investing in these approaches, beginning with cross-spectrum data collection an d performance models, followed by prototype sensor developmen t. An aerosol testbed has been devel oped to provide calibrated exposures of thr eat agent simulants and complex clutter mixtures for sensor performance evaluation.

This program will investigate identification methodologies inclu ding: bead-based assays for biological molecules, fluorescent assays re tro-reflector assays for chemical and biological agents; a ll of which can be interrogated with stand-off optical detectors. To accomplish th e removal of the threat, technologies that mimic the seeding of rain clouds will be developed for particulate bio-agents, and technologies that react with chemical agent vapor will be investigated. Upon success ful demonstration of the identification and removal technologies, a system will be developed to demonstrate the removal of chemical and biological s imulant clouds from the battlefield.

This effort will develop a sensor, based upon rotational spectroscopy of gases that will h ave superior capability in all categories; it will achieve the highest possible sensitivit y (parts-per-trillion) for unambiguous detection of all chemi cal species. A preliminary blind test showed complete and unambiguous identifi cation with a sampling time of one second and a false alarm prob ability below 0.001%. At present, the program has investigated the nature of the atmospheric background \"clu tter\" at the parts per billion ( ppb) level and below to enable the identification of target signatures at highest sensitivity. The program will focus on reduction of size and simp licity of function to achieve portability and simultaneous detection of a large numbe r (hundreds) of species.

S. military platforms to increase survivability, deployability, and maintain ability. Current lighting systems use electrical dist ribution and the generation of light at the point-of-use. HEDLight remote sour ce lighting uses centralized light generation and optically trans ports the light to the point-of-use. This allows the lighting system electrical circu itry and wiring to be concentrated, protected, and removed to th e interior of the warship, thereby removing a source of vul nerability from the outer-envelope. Critical metrics that are necessary for the succe ssful implementation of HEDLight are system efficiency, weight, and control of the illumination pattern. The technical areas key to the success of the HEDLight program include the development of compact, high-efficiency, fu ll-spectrum sources; high-efficiency and integrated illuminator e ngines that effectively combine the light source, the optical coupler, and fiber- luminaire.

The propulsion mechanism of the elec tric eel may hold the key to this enabling technology. Electric eels using ribbon fi n propulsion may be generating tr aveling chains of ring vort ices, which give more momentum transfer than simply pushing the same quantity of fluid with no structure. The objective of the program is to develop a ribbon fin propulsion system and demonstrate the increased low velocity pow er efficiency and maneuverability of an actual underwater platf orm. The fundamental technical challenges include 1) determining if the trav eling wave is structured to ma ximize thrust, 2) determining the structure of the fluid flow imparted by the ribbon fin, 3) determining how to implement a flexible ribbon structure with sufficient power and co ntrollability to be useful, and 4) determining how to attach such a structure to a rigid body and integrate it with other control surfaces to gain additional degrees of freedom.

The Novel Sensors program cons ists of the Unique Signature Detection program (formerly know n as the Odortype Detection program) and the Urban Vision program. (U) The objective of the Unique Signature Detection program is to determine, by means of a well-de veloped scientific methodology, w hether there are unique signatures in emanations that can be used to identify and distinguish specific high-level-of-interest individu als within groups of enemy troops or combatants, and if so, to develop enabling tech nology for detecting and identi fying those specific signatures. The program consists of an interdisciplinary team of performers using state- of-the-art techniques to evaluate the statistical, biological a nd chemical nature of individual emanations. Once the nature of the chemosignal has been characterized, performers w ill determine the impact of non- genetic factors (e.g., diet, stress, health, age) on the signal in order to de termine whether the signal can be robustly extracted from a compl ex and varied chemical background. If an exploitable robust signature is identif ied, the program will then pursue detector development.

The HELLADS program is al so funding a novel turbulence control effort, the Aero Adaptive Bea m Control program, in order to optimize aft laser operations in flight. (U) The HELLADS program has completed the design and demonstration of a revolutionary subscale high energy laser that supports the goal of a lightweight and compact high energy laser weapon system. An objective unit cell laser module with integrated power and th ermal management is being designed and will be fa bricated and demonstrated at an output power of 17 kW. Based on the results of this demonstration, additional laser modules will be fabricated to produce a 150 kW laser that will be demonstrated in a laboratory environment. T he 150 kW laser will then be integrated with an existing beam control capability to produce a laser weapon system demonstrator. The capability to shoot down tactical targets such as surface-to-air mi ssiles and rockets will be demonstrated. (U) The goal of the Aero Adaptive Beam Control (ABC) program is to improve the performance of high energy lasers on tactical aircra ft against targets in the aft field of regard. In order to ac hieve high off-boresight targeting capability, current optical turre t designs protrude into the flow. This causes severe aero-optic distortions in the aft field of regard due to turbulence in the wake and the unsteady shoc k movement over the aperture. These distortions decrease the power flux on target (the measure of lethality for a directed energy system) and limi t the directed energy system to targets in the forward field of regard. This progr am will optimize flow control strategies for pointing angles in th e aft field of regard. The program will also explore the ability of the flow control syst em to be synchronized with the adaptive optics. This effort will initially focus on wind tunnel testing to prove the feasibility of steady and period ic flow control techniques to reduce or regularize the large s cale turbulent structures surrounding an optical turret. Th ese tests will culminate in a hardware-in-th e-loop demonstration with an adaptive optics system. Following successful wind tunnel demonstrations, a preliminary desi gn of a flight test turret incorporating flow control on the turret and compatible with the HELLADS laser system will be undertaken.

At least two diode-based laser approaches will be explored in this program, both involving antimonide-based compound semiconductor (ABCS) materials. These include intersubband-based quantum cas cade lasers (QCLs) and type-II antimonide lasers, including so-called \"W-configuration\" approaches, the name taken from the shape of the conduction band profile.

Current technology uses natural stars or an artificial star (called a \"guide star\") to provide a reference image from which the effects of th e atmosphere can be computed and cancelled. Natural stars limi t the pointing of the telescope. Artificial guide star technology currently makes use of either stratospheric Rayleigh backscatter or mesospheric so dium resonance scattering. These techniques have been utili zed to successfully demonstrate strategi es for wavefront compensation, but suffer from practical restrictions limiting operational utility. Rayleigh guide stars can be effectively generated to altitudes of 15 - 20 km, beyon d which decreasing air densities reduce the backscatter to the poin t where unrealistic laser powers are required for useful return signal. The altitu de is insufficient to provide full atmospheric sampling and suffers from sensor/target signal cancellation. S odium resonance scattering is available to 90 km, which is an essentially complete atmosphere sample, but the return is mo nochromatic and cannot provide in formation about turbulence-indu ced absolute tilt.

Integration of compact inlets and nozzles that are light weight and survivable continue to be a challenge. Traditional nozzles are cantilevered off the engine face and the airframe, with an overlap region to account for thermal growth. This approach to nozz le integration results in heavy, high maintenance nozzles and is structurally ineffici ent. It also poses a significant engine integration challenge a nd can drive vehicle sizing. A fully integrated nozzle, designed to take airframe loads through the nozzle, and built of a high temperature ceramic , would address the weight and structural integration problems directly.

Mission applications include signal processing, de tection, tracking, identification, situation understanding, p lanning, and control functions. These applications will integrat e: (1) external sensors and processors th at provide data on targets and mission con texts; (2) external platforms, both air and surface, that deliver sensors and m unitions to designated areas; (3 ) intelligence processing systems at all levels of command; and (4) external communications ne tworks that provide connectivity between computing nodes located on the platforms, a t field command centers, and headquarters. The mission applications shar e data to form consistent battlespace understanding tailored t o the needs of commanders at each node. The types of tailoring include common operational pictures, timelines, and resource usage description s. The mission applications also negotiate plans for futu re operations based on mission needs presented at each node. To maintain focus on op erationally relevant problems, the project's technical goals are posed and ev aluated in the context of mixed manned/unmanned forces. (U) Technologies developed in this project enable localized and distributed collaborative pr ocessing. This allows networks of sens ors to rapidly adapt to changing force mixes, communications connectiv ity, and mission objectives.

NEST is the key software building block needed to enab le ad-hoc or structured wireless sensor networks to function to gether. Applications of these systems include: localization of snipers by collaborative sensor fusion in real time (i.e., within two se conds), sensor network- based tripwires and chokepoints for detection and discrimination of personnel and vehicles, and wide-area, 24/7 surveillance of long linear structures, (i.e., pipelines and borders). These applications requi re from tens to tens of thousands of nodes. NEST produces reusable software libraries and design tools that simplify the developm ent of wireless sensor network applications. (U) In particular, this technology is being combined with an active exciter to develop a radar-like sensor system to measure human activity inside buildings. The approach exploits existing wiring networks (power) to provide persistent surveillance of buildings and b elow grade areas. The concept is to insert radar pulses into a building's main power feed and read pul se returns from a wireless network of senso rs placed around the building. The building's own wiring network serves as a tran smission line to conduct these pulses throughout a structure, and every outlet or switch serves as an antenna to couple these radar waves to and from free-space. (U) Program Plans: Develop tools for the automatic composition and verification of application-specific coordination service packages; demonstrate the utility of these tools in a fully integrated system c onsisting of a large network of heterogeneous sensors. Develop tools for remotely reprogramming large scale sensor networ ks and services for authentication and data encryption in tho se networks.

Narrative Title FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 FY See (CZTS) 7.436 5.000 6.000 8.000 (U) The Combat Zones That See (CZTS) program improves the situationa l awareness, effectiveness, and safety of U.S. military forces in foreign urban environments (e.g., Mozul). CZTS provides cl ose-in sensing and extended reconnaissance capabilities using a netw ork of video sensors. The system tracks vehicles over urban areas using sparse arrays of video cameras, automatically detecting vehicles th at may be involved in hostile activities based on the observed tracks. This networ k produces an extreme amount of raw data, precluding human anal ysis, so advanced video understanding algorithms embedded in commercial-off-the-shelf hardware systems monitor the video feeds automatically. As processing requirements become well-understood, novel image-processing chips w ill be integrated and interleaved with focal plane arrays wi thin a conventional camera architecture, and a fully-compatible communi cations link developed to support a video-based system for peri meter defense. CZTS will enable vehicle identification with a 10,000-fold reduc tion in the bandwidth required to transmit key data across the camera network and will provide the capability to track vehicles non-continuously acro ss extended distances. The CZTS goal is to demonstrate tech nology packaged into a flexible ground-deployed system. (U) Program Plans: Developed, installed overseas, and evaluated a force protec tion prototype that employs approximately 30 cameras. Demonstrated sustained tracking of individual vehicl es using sensors whose fields-of-view do not overlap. Use vehicle track data to calibrate cameras, learn patterns of activity, and retrieve similar or related events from a track da tabase.

Narrative Title FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Automated Battle Management 13.723 17.400 20.418 18.328 (U) The pace of battle will continue to increase as more-capable platforms and higher-bandwidth communication networks become operational. While experienced commanders are required to fo rmulate strategy and select tactics, the increased operational tem po will demand more automation of low-level decision processes, such as route-find ing, weapon/target pairing, and sensor scheduling. Some ele ments of these processes, such as collision avoidance and na vigation, will be embedded in each platform . However, groups of platforms will be able to execute cooperative tactics to achieve coordinated effects. This cross-platform coordina tion and synchronization requires new technolo gies that can carry out aggregate maneuvers and tasks, while le veraging the functions embedded in each plat form. This program is developing novel technologies for multi-platform, automated battle management at the tactical level, in the air, on the ground, and within mobile sensor networks . The Collaborative Networked Autonomous Vehicles (CNAV) program de velops autonomous control methods to cause a distributed set o f unmanned undersea vehicles to self-organize and distribute tasks th rough judicious transactions conveyed over a shared communic ations network. CNAV illustrates these capabilities through development of a capability for submerged target detection, localization, and tracking in restrictive littoral waters. CNAV provides this capab ility by creating a field of dozens or hundreds of vehicles, networked through acoustic wireless communications. The vehicles work colla boratively and autonomously to detect, classify, localize and track target submarines transiting the field. The field self-organizes to adapt to changes in target locations, environmental condit ions, and operational factors. A reach-back capability allows reporting of field health and enables high-le vel orders and control functi ons to be provided to the field. CNAV will also result in a significant reduc tion in the cost per square m ile for submerged target detec tion in littoral waters. 162UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Tactical Technology PE 0602702E, Project TT-13 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 16 Page 65 of 74 The Organic Sensor Exploitation Network (OSEN ) program goal is to provide truly persis tent, all-weather, day/night surveillance of a large ground area from the air using multiple radars providing imag ery and target detection data at a high revisit rate. The o bjective is to move processing closer to the sensor to reduce the need for expe nsive communications back to a central site and provide robustn ess to unexpected loss of platforms, communications disruptions, and unpred ictable target behavior. OSEN is developing technology to: (1) permit on-board exploitation of sensor data from remotely deployed sensor nodes; (2) support correlation of information develop ed across different platforms; (3) detect, track, and identify targets in the field-of-view of a platform; (4) cue other sensors to acqui re a target; (5) develop effective low-cost, light-weight ra dars and (6) transition targets to other platforms as different targets move through sensor fields- of-view. OSEN system-level studies evaluate the relative valu e of different sensor mixes against low-flying aircraft, ground v ehicles, dismounted infantry, and irregular forces.

High fidelity baselin es will be created to support change detection to cue searches for targets and anticip ate changes due to current or impending meteorological events. The program will supply real-time context information to sensor managers, maneuve r controllers, weapons operators , and commanders. Furthermore, the program will filter natural change from artificial ch ange indicative of human (threat) activity and permit operation of military forces in hostile terrain normally deemed favorable to opponents because of their historical familiarity with hide points, sight lines, and mobility char acteristics.

Implicit in this thrust is the fact that there are unique, warfighter-specific challenges in acute and chronic treatment that are not addressed by civilian research and development. Tod ay, more than half of American battlefield fatalities are due to hemorrhage, particul arly due to improvised explosive devices (IEDs). To prevent these deaths, there is an urgent need for technologies that enable relatively unskille d personnel (battlefield medics) to diagnose and treat injuries, including the ability to locate and coagulate non-compressible deep bleed ers in the thorax or abdomen. Ultimate ly, this thrust will develop and demonst rate tele-robotic, semi-autonomous trauma pods that will bring life-saving surgical car e directly to the front lines. Other critical needs stem f rom the fact that warfighters are frequently victims of blasts, causing patterns of brain, burn, and orthopedic injuries not seen in civilian med ical practice. As such, there is a unique military need to develop systems for pain cont rol that are safe even in medically unmonitored environments, l ike an active battlefield. And once lives are saved, there is an unmet need for new methods to restore function, for example, by restoring l ong segments of bone that were lost due to blast fragmentation. Overall, this th rust recognizes the unique medical and surgical needs of warfighter s, and will develop innovative technologies to save warfighters lives and restore their function to normal. (U) Program Plans: Develop a lightweight version of the Life Support for Trauma and Transport (LSTAT) portable intensive care platform with innovative technologies to make the system available in the far forward battlefield for combat casualty care of wounded soldier s. Define and demonstrate new operating room technologies for th e battlefield that reduce the need for operating personnel. Develop and demonstrate devices to locate and co agulate bleeding using focused acoustic energy.

Develop novel biochemical feedback mechan isms and nanotechnology-based delivery sy stems to create a feedback regulated battlefield drug delivery system.

Significant improvements in the performance, affordability, and deployability of imaging sensor systems will be obtained through rational co-design and joint o ptimization of the imaging optics, the photo sensor array and the post-processing al gorithms. By reaching well beyond conventional designs, MONTA GE sensors will realize optimal distribution of information handling func tions between analog optics and digital post-detection processing . (U) Specific demonstrations include reduction of the depth/thickness of an imaging sensor by an order of magnitude without compromi sing its light gathering ability or resolution. This dramatic reduction in thickness will then allow the imaging sensors to be deployed conformally around a curved surface of a platform (e.g., UAV, tank, or helmet). Furthermore, the flexibilit y generated by the incorporation of post -processing in the image formation will allow variable resolution image formation, wh ich in turn reduces the data lo ad for subsequent image exploi tation and communication systems.

This revolutionary app roach will reduce payload adaptation, optimization and veri fication processes from years to minutes. The program breaks the current development approach of hardware first and software last by moving beyond conventional silicon to flexible polymorphous computing systems. The key eff orts of this revolutionary step forward in embedded computing systems are: (1) define critical reactive computing requirements and critical micro- architectural features; (2) explore, develop and prototype reac tive polymorphous computing concepts; (3) explore, develop and p rototype multi- dimensional verification and validation tec hniques for dynamic reactive missions; (4) provide early experimental testbeds and p rototype polymorphous computing systems; and (5) extend PCA to enable early commercial product development and transition to the DoD and intelligence communities.

In addition, th is technique would allow 'system on a wafer' development to support low volume system s while providing low cost production and quick turnaround. (U) Additionally, as more and more chip fabrica tion is outsourced and the U.S. becomes more susceptible to faults and malicious har dware components, the need for autonomously adaptiv e mechanisms has become apparent as anothe r extension of the PCA program.

This self-aware trusted computing technology will en able the delivery of a more robust, self correcting trustable co mputing system. (U) The resulting PCA technology will mark a new generation of on-b oard, embedded computing processing capabilities that will be mi ssion and technology agnostic yet highly optimizable for each new mission scenario. This processing capability will provide tactical and strategic mission tempo opportunities as well as technical upgradeability over th e life of the computing system.

I n the future, heavy fuel (diesel or JP-8) may be the only logistic fu el for the battlefield. Conventional heavy fuel engines are too heavy for air vehicles and, at the desired size, not efficient enough. Innovative and advanced diesel engine designs ar e being developed to achieve b oth efficiency and a significant reduction in weight. Such engines will enable air vehicles increased maximum range and endurance while operating o n diesel fuel. Novel approaches to achieving challenging performance goals include an opposed piston, opposed cylinder (OPOC) concept and a ve ry low friction in-line opposed piston configuration. The OPOC engine is designed to achieve sustained high power at high altitude an d to minimize the impact of lapse rate. The Low Friction Engine (LFE) is designe d to operate without conventional piston rings which are a princ ipal cause of internal combustion engine friction and dimi nish the amount of useful work that is available from an engine. Detailed design, fabrication, and testing is being conducted to assess engine performance and reliability. Initial engi ne technology transition planning identif ied the A160 air vehicle as a promising platform for a heavy fuel engine. Integr ation of a heavy fuel engine could potentially double endurance for a given weight of fuel. Potential customers include the Army, Special Operations Command (SOCOM), and Marines.

The vehicle will demonstrate persisten t, sustained gunship and strike mission capabilities with troops on the ground di rectly commanding the aircraft's weapons and sensors. The gunship will give the ground warfighter particular advantage in urban environments where it will operate with high availability, fast response, p recision strike and low collateral damage. The ability to have a pilot on-board will allow for easy deploy ment to theater and safe operation over populated areas by allowing the pilot to interface with the air traffic control infr astructure rather than the current, cumbersome method of deplo ying large UAVs. The plan to \"unman\" an existing aircraft also minimizes development co sts.

Today such aircraf t rely on stealth technology to avoid detec tion and engagement by long range surface to air mi ssile threats. In the future, the unique advantage enjoyed by the United States may be eroded by technological advances, and stealth y aircraft often give up thei r advantage in detectibility whe n they utilize active radar and laser sensors in the conduct of their mission. An active aircraft self-defense system could relax the design constra ints imposed by signature control, allowing a greater range of platform cap abilities. Because lasers provide \"speed-of-light\" response and a d eep magazine, we will examine their suitability relative to the more conventional missile based solutions.

Current large space systems used for national security purposes are constrained due to their monolithic architectur e. They can be launched only on a small number of large launc h vehicles, cannot readily be upgraded and/ or reconfigured with new hardware on-o rbit, and are risk-intensive, since the unforgiving launch and space environments can result in a total loss of investment with one mistake. The System F6 will partition the tasks performed by monolithic spacecraft (power, r eceivers, control modules, etc.) and assign each task to a dedi cated small or micro satellite. This fractionated space system offers the potential for reduced risk, gr eater flexibility (e.g. simplified on-orbit servicing, reconfigurability to meet changing mission needs), payload isol ation, faster deployment of initial capability, and potential fo r improved survivability. This program will develop, design, and test new space system architectures and technologies required to success fully decompose a spacecraft into fundamental elements.

Narrative Title FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 4.000 8.500 (U) The goal of the NanoPayload Delivery (NPD) program is to validat e the technical feasibility of ultralightweight, rapid-response spacecraft delivery from land, sea, or air-based platforms. Such nanopayloads (1-10 kilograms) could be boosted to low earth orbit (200 k m altitude) in a matter of hours following call-up. Multiple sorties are envisioned, enabling a number of small spacecraft to be placed in an o rbit \"box\" and aggregated together to perform a mission. The NPD program will develop and test a lightweight rocket platform similar in size to existing small missile systems such as the High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HAR M), AIM-7, or AIM-120. Current technology does not permit su ch small systems to reach orbit, owing to disproportionately high drag an d low thrust-to-weight rocket engines. NPD will leverage ongoi ng technology development efforts, which permit the fabrica tion of microscale pumps, thrust chambers, and valves. Such rocket engines, which are theoretically capable of thrust-to-weight ratios of 100:1 or greater, would allow for significant reductions in overall engine mass and permi t nanosatellites to be placed in low orbits for several weeks to months. The delivery system would rely on one of several methods for launch, includi ng: (1) a stock aircraft, such as the F-15E or F-16, (2) a truck-mounted erector , or (3) the deck of a small naval vessel. The goal for per-so rtie cost is $100,000. Fielding NPD will permit U.S. forces to rapidly emplace short-term capabilities in low orbit, when they are needed, without res orting to legacy domestic launch systems that are sized and costed for much larger payloads. NPD will also allow many non-traditional users (e. g. laboratories, operational commanders, and small commercial firms) the capability to \"use space\" by lowe ring the significant barrier to entry into space.

Partial plans are represen ted in hierarchical task networks and visuali zed through synchronization matrices, icon overlays, or tactical sketch anim ations. Commanders and staff modify, refine, and extend a plan through voice, sketching, and semi-structured input. The system links fragmen ts constructed at different sit es, transfers information among r elated parts, and discovers and recommends solutions for inc onsistencies. The system continuously compiles a set of plan cases and employs analo gical matching to propose extensions to current plans suggested by past experi ence. Plan elements are communi cated through an integrated set of protocols from the unit commander down to dismount commanders equipped with advanced heads-up displays and helmet-worn sensors. Finally, the program continuously assesses progress against the operational pl an and alerts users to significant deviations. The Multi-spectral Adaptive Networked Tactical Imaging System (M ANTIS) program develops, integrates, and demonstrates a soldier - worn visualization system. Both helmet-mounted and handheld ve rsions will be built during Phase 3 of the program. The system consists of five elements: 1) multi-spectral sensor suite; 2) high reso lution measurement unit (IMU); 4) h igh-speed processor; and 5) power supply. MANTIS provides the warfighter with digitally-fused imagery in real time from the multi-spectr al sensor suite, exploiting three distinct spectral bands: 1) the Visible/Ne ar Infrared (VNIR, .4 - .9 mi crons); 2) the Short Wave Infra red (SWIR, 1 - 2 microns); and 3) the Long Wave Infrared (LWIR, 8 - 12 microns). The fused imagery is shown on two displays; one has a wide f ield-of view and the other a narrow field-of-view. When viewed together the system furnishes a larger field-of-view image with simulta neous high resolution and stereo capability. The system also allows the warfighters to record and \"p lay back\" the video while on the battlefield. The record/playback feature includes: electronic zoom, scroll, pan and panoramic image stitching. MANTIS provides a vision-ai ded inertial navigation system (INS) and will interface with the futu re soldier's global positioning system (GPS). When combined w ith precise pose estimation from the helmet-mounted IMU, MANTIS allows battlefield information to be overlaid on the display to pro vide increased situational awareness. MANTIS in terfaces with the future soldier's advanced communications and networking systems, allowing the warfighter to send/receive video images and position in formation with fellow soldiers and commanders in real time. The coupling of the imaging system with INS/GPS will provide the individual warfighter a \"point-click-kill\" capability for real-tim e target hand-off capability to networked smart weapons fired from remote locations, thereby significantly increasing the lethality of t he individual 324UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Command, Control and Communications Systems PE 0603760E, Project CCC-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 51 Page 9 of 34 warfighter. There is a Memorandum of Agreement in place with the Program Executive Officer Soldier, and Night Vision & Electro nics Sensor Directorate for transition at the conclusion of Phase III anticipated to be co mpleted early in FY 2008. The ULTRA-VIS program will develop an integrated system to provide Army and Marine small unit leaders with the ability to condu ct daytime operations in an urban environment. Key technologies will be developed to significantly improve the awareness, lethali ty and survivability for small units in urban combat. The system will include a conformal, see-through, optical waveguide visor that displays intra-squad commands, alerts, and even icons that are attached to the urban landscape. Network protocols will be developed for information management that allows the squad leader to hand-off actionable information and direct alerts to the squad /fire tea ms for real- time collaboration without overload. ULTRA-VIS will relay standa rd phrases and visual annotations that can be issued covertly, avoiding hand signals or shouting that may be recognized by the enemy. A robust, optically-assisted navigation technique will provide c ontinuous geo-location and head tracking for each squad member while opera ting in GPS-denied environments. The ULTRA-VIS system will synthesize weapon fire observables across a networked moving squad to detect and locate hostile w eapon fire using a helmet moun ted IR sensor and small acoustic array for precise sniper location and r eal time designation within the warfighter's visor. ULTRA-VIS will empower the small unit leader with a clear tactical advantage th rough inter/intra squad collabora tion, heightened awareness and the ability to take decisive action while on-the-move. The ULTRA- VIS technology is planned for transition to the Army. An urban warfare environment presents the warfighter with lim ited sightlines and mobility with insufficient knowledge of the di sposition of enemy combatants, civilians, and occupied structures. As a result, the warfighter requires situational awareness informatio n, presented in a manner that accounts for current operational context and pe rsonal strengths, limitations, and preferences. The Urban Comm ander program develops planning and control tools to support dism ounted troops equipped with MANT IS and ULTRA-VIS sensors and displays. \"On-the-ground\" warfighters do not have time to constan tly check an information rich visual display. Cognitive Impe dance Matching (CIM) technology will deve lop a prototype system for presenting the inform ation at the correct time and format to the affected individual. The system will ensure that situational awarenes s will be obtained and maintained across a range of echelons and b attlefield conditions. Urban Commander forms a command and control substrat e that enables ground forces, including vehicles and dismounts , to rapidly coordinate actions as the situation and commanders knowledge of the situation ch ange. The program includes: 1) spatia l analysis to determine lines of sight and fields of fire; 2) planning ai ds to assist in sensor placement and route planning; 3) visualiza tion tools to allow commanders and soldiers to rapidly a pprehend and address a situation; and 4) anal ysis tools to suggest locations and type s of 325UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Command, Control and Communications Systems PE 0603760E, Project CCC-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 51 Page 10 of 34 potential threats.

HURT employs a model-based control archit ecture with dynamic teaming and platform-independent comma nd and control. The system registers ne w platforms with the battle manager (kine matics, maneuverability, endurance, payloa ds, and communications links) to facilitate plat form-independent tasking. HURT provides a co mmander's interface that allows collaborative tasking of the platforms in the form of operational missions, such as search, track, identi fy, or engage, rather than routes and events. Additionally, it supplies computationall y intensive decision aids, such as advanced 4D airspace and gr oundspace deconfliction tools, route planners, and t ask/platform assignments algorithms. The technology presents mission status and futu re courses of action to commanders for collaborative adjudication. HURT enables augmentation of low-footpr int, rapidly deployable, easily sustainab le human command structures with teams of machines operating together.

DAR PA's Cognitive Systems programs have been developing the machine learning, reasoning, and huma n-machine dialogue technologies necessary to create cognitive assistants. This new te chnology promises to enable information systems to adapt - during deployme nt, in real time - to the changing conditions that military co mmanders confront. Information systems will automatically adjust to new en vironments and new users, helping commanders adapt to evolvin g situations and priorities, and accelerating the incorporation of new personnel into command operations. This program will fund the portions o f the technologies developed in the Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) progr am (funded in PE 0602304E, Project COG-02) that are ready for ap plication to command and control systems. (U) From an operational perspective, cognitive approaches to information processing offer three major enhancements to current comma nd and control systems. First, it will efficiently sort, segregate, sep arate and identify relevant data based on priority hierarchies established by the command structure. For example, image data could be selected ba sed on target priority, historical context or anomalous changes .

Finally, cognitive systems will make relevant data generally available to all users both during collabor ative planning processes and individual ta ctical analysis. In short, cognitive technology is introducing th e equivalent of \"just in time\" inventory management to information management for command decision-making. (U) The Army's Command Post of the Future (C POF), the Navy's Composeable FORCENet (CFn) and the USAF's Air Tasking Order (ATO) information systems with the Air Operations Center (AOC), have been identified as target systems for the application of this ne w cognitive systems technology. These systems support complex situation asse ssment and decision making, process massive data streams and r equire users to integrate uncertain and dynamically changing information. They represent a spectrum of potential needs and constraints and tak en together will assure that cognitive systems technology is of general appli cability and utility throughout the military. Cognitive assistants will enable users to handle additional tasks as well as tasks of greater complexity. This will ultimately reduce the staffing footprint of command centers.

The PZRM communications program will investiga te the use of polarization, including orthogonal signal spectrum overlay, modula tion and the ability for conventional radios to carry all inf ormation over the transmitted signal amplitude, phase and frequency. Polarization modulation introduces an additional dimension. A radio with f our polarization possibilities would transmit four times the information with all othe r aspects of the waveform held constant. Use of the anten na as part of the information processing architecture of a radio has not been prev iously performed. This technology will greatly increase the ca pability of existing channels without increasing spectrum or modem complexity. The progr am will be demonstrated as an enhancement to an otherwise s tate of the art networking system. The Polarization Modulation technology w ill begin transition to Service applications in FY 2008.

The Connectionl ess Networking (CN) program will develop technology to allow networks (such as UGS) to send and receive messages without initial link acquis ition or previous sharing of routing information. This w ill improve energy usage per bit of delivered information by as much as 100 to 1,000 times compared to conventional and near-term deployable commu nications systems. Conventional radio link and netw ork designs expend most of the energy on link establishment and maintenance, as well as packet and network overhead. This energy requirement not only limits th e lifetime of energy-limited systems, it unnecessarily fills the r adio spectrum, limiting available bandwidth, creates unnecessary risks of detection, and increases thermal loads. These impacts are especiall y severe for communications with proliferated sensors, or remotely operated we apons. Eliminating the requirement to maintain a continuous n etwork link would enable these platforms to provide con tinuous connectivity without consumption of power, or compromising emanations. The CN program will exploit existing and available signal processing components, intelligent (processing and memory intensive) routing, and av ailability of situational information to demonstrate a total energy savings of at least 100 times typical conn ection oriented network applica tions. The Connectionless Networking technology is planned for transition to the Special Operations Command, Army, Navy, and Air Force for unattended ground sensors and low duty cycle applications beginning in FY 2009. (U) Program Plans: Translated CN technology design and simula tions into actual hardware and software. Designed and fabricated prototype CN network node devices, and performed la boratory demonstrations. Develop and evaluate candidate appro aches for implementation complexity, on-boa rd processor and memory capability/power, overhead, scalability and performance. Design and fabricate prototype Connectionless Networking node devi ces with hardware and form factor suitable for military applications. Conduct 30 node field demonstrati ons using CN devices in a form factor suitable for transition. 335UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Command, Control and Communications Systems PE 0603760E, Project CCC-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 51 Page 20 of 34 Narrative Title FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 5.000 5.000 (U) The Next Generation (XG) program goals are to develop both the enabling technologies and system concepts to provide dramatic improvements in assured military communications in support of a full range of worldwide deployments through dynamic spectrum ac cess. U.S. Forces face unique spectrum access issues in each country in which they operate due to competing civilian or government users o f national spectrum. These constraints must be reflected in all force pl anning and may preclude operation of critical systems. Coalition and allied operations are even more complex to manage, and may severely limit the U.S. ability to fully exploit its superiority and investment in inf ormation technology. The XG program approach is to develop the theore tical underpinnings for dynamic access to the spectrum, the techno logies and subsystems that enable dynamic access, and the system prototyp es to demonstrate applicability to legacy and future DoD radio fr equency emitters. The program is investigating methods to le verage the technology base in microelectronics with new waveform and medium access an d control protocol technologies to construct an integrated system. The pr ogram goals are to develop, inte grate, and evaluate the technol ogy to enable equipment to automatically select spectrum and operating modes to both minimize disruption of existing users, and to ensure ope ration of U.S. systems. The result of the XG program will be to develop and demonstrate a set of standard dynamic spectrum adaptation technol ogies for legacy and future emitter systems for joint service utility. The XG Communi cations technology is planned to transition to the Army fo r implementation in a range of current and future communication systems incl uding the Joint Tactical Radio Systems clusters in FY 2009.

Such a reduction will significantly decrease the probability of detection of transmitted signals and will also decrease the requi red transmit energy, thereby increasing battery lifetime. The program will pursue two novel approaches toward achieving its goal. One approach builds upon multiple noise-im mune sensors that have been combined with traditional coding algorithms to achieve significant improvements in intelligibility and quality in harsh noisy environments at 2,400 bits per second (bps). This approach will be extended to nontraditional ultra-low-bit-rate coding algorithms in order to achieve 300 bps codin g capability in harsh military environments. Alternative approaches will also be e xplored, such as the communication without acoustic information ac hieved by extracting laryngeal and sublingual muscle signals that are produced when a person generates sub vo cal speech. This approach w ill yield a revolutionary capability in situations where stealth is of the ut most importance, or in situations where acoustic signals canno t be used, such as under water. The Advanced Speech Encoding technology is planned for transition to the Communications and Electronics Command o f the U.S. Army after a prototype demonstration scheduled for FY 2009. (U) Program Plans: Demonstrated a voice communication system (sensors plus coder) operating at 1,000 bps that is at least as good as today's DoD standard in harsh military noisy environments.

This effort created a system control me thodology allowing intuitive control over complex communications sy stems while still preserving the flexibility of the emerging ad-hoc networks. In addition to creating a method for an operator to understand the state of the network, PBNM allows the network to implement the commander's intent fo r the operation by dynamically changing function and allocation t hroughout the duration of a mission. PBNM controls traffic at the application level by making the system aware of what is currently possible , what is currently allowed, and how communications are expected to change over the duration of a mission.

Mechanisms and protocols that reduce band width consumption, reduce latency, and improve re liability of information delivered to tacti cal deployments will be explored. The pr ogram is also exploring a new security model which protects information held in portable devices. To maximize the applicability and commerci al viability of these protocols, and develop the basic software in an open sour ce mode, the military, commercial and Internet communities have been engaged.

Netw ork centricity, among other benefits, fac ilitates the sharing of situation information and access to resources. Shar ed situation awareness enables collaboration and self synchroniz ation at all operational levels thereby greatly increasi ng mission effectiveness. Military campaigns in the future will not necessarily be focused solely on major military operations. These campaigns will involve attempts at conflict avoidance, and if this fails, possibly major comb at operations with periods of various security, stability, reconstruction, transforma tion and transition operations. Future campaigns will be cha racterized by an increased demand for the commander to employ the most appropria te actions (diplomatic, information operations, military, econom ic, etc.) against the adversary's various political, military (air, land and sea; re gular or irregular), economic, social, information distributi on, infrastructure, etc. systems. Commanders in the future will use network centricity to access a larger base of knowledge sources and a greater range of resources and actions. Concurrently, the commander will be challenged to ex ploit these capabilities to achieve a mixture of appropriate effe cts. (U) Until recently, the primary technological emphasis for network centric operations has been on improving command, control, communications and computing, intellig ence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems to enable better sensor-decider-shooter linkages. While appropriate, there must also be more emphasis on tec hnologies to assist commanders in understanding the complex operation al environment, developing and ma naging intervention campaigns using an effects b ased approach to operations that employ all optio ns available to the commander, and synchronizing combat operations, security, stab ility, reconstruction, transfor mation and transition operatio ns over the entire time of the campaign.

Originally, the program focused on specific technol ogies for application on the Navy's EA-6B Prowler aircraft, how ever, the program has been broadened to focus on technologies that will provide advanced capabilities to a multitude of military aircraft, shipbo ard and aerospace platforms. These new capabilities include: scalability in bandwidth and number of connected devices; immunity to electromagnet ic interference (EMI) and cable cross-talk; reduced cable and overall system wei ght and volume; increased reliab ility without an associated wei ght or volume penalty; ease of integration and future upg radeability; and the ability to carry mixed analog and digital signal formats. This will be accomplished by taking full advantage of fiber-optical wavelength-divisi on-multiplexing (WDM) technology and leveraging optoelectronic and p hotonic integration techniques developed in DARPA photonics components progr am. To reduce size, weight and power requirements and to i ncrease the reliability and the flexibility of interconn ecting arbitrarily placed client devices with various signal formats, use will be m ade of passive, transparent, wavelength-routing technology at the core of the network, and tunable optical transmitters and receivers (transcei vers) to inter-connect the client devices at the edge of the network.

Currently SOF teams rely on satellite communications (Satco m) for long range connectivity. However, Satcom requires line of site acces s, and channel availability. Th e Advanced HF Communications wi ll develop antenna and radio technology to provide high -rate communications at long ranges using gr ound wave and near vertical incidence s kywave (NVIS) propagation. A fundamental challenge is re ducing the size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements for SOF applicability. Novel miniature HF antenna technologies and channel adaptive ra dio technologies will be devel oped and demonstrated in man portable form factors. The technologies developed under this program are planned for transition to Special Forces in FY 2010.

Current network routing methodologies use IP address numbers that are distributed i n no defined pattern or methodology. As a result, current routing system s spend large amounts of time and computing power updating and main taining tables that 'point' to where different IP addresses are located geogra phically. The self-forming networks will reduce the load on rou ters as well as greatly simplify router configuration. These networks will be a paradigm shift in that numbered IP addresses will no longer ex ist, and changes to the Domain Naming Server (DNS) system will allow for services to m obile users to be incorporated. This program is planned for transition to the Services in FY 2011. (U) Program Plans: Develop machine naming schema for data packets that are geographi cally based and that allow for fine grained control of precede nce and improved quality of service capabilities. Develop tactical router replacements that work with existing co mputers/routers and require no new configuration and enable self - forming networks that will result in at least an order-of-magn itude reduction in training, conf iguration, and installation time .

In particular, the current performance of Silicon Germanium a nd Indium Phosphide bipolar device technol ogy is now fast enough, with cut-off freque ncies of > 350 GHz, that error correction technique such as predistortion and feed forward correction can be considered for application to rad io frequency (RF) components. The effort will develop new circuit topologies and algorithms along with cross technology integration schemes. Th is combination will increase the maximum signal data rate (increase the bits/sec/ Hz) for DoD RF links.

Key capabilities that will be enabled by this program include: (1) the elimination of powe r needs in the core of the network through the design and fabri cation of passive wavelength-routing nodes that will allow the switching functions t o be done via tunable optical transmitters and receivers (transceivers) at the edge of the network; (2) enha nced network survivability throug h a suitable highly connected network topology leveraging a fast -restoration protocol capable of rapid r ecovery from multiple network node and link failures; and (3) extended geographical coverage of the network to hundreds of kilometers, without requiring additional power at the core. In ad dition, protocols will be developed to enable the connection of this network to tactical wireless netw orks as well as to existing fixed networks allowing the efficient transmission of a combination of internet protocol (IP), dig ital video streams as well as analog and digital radar, electronic warfare (EW) and RF signals. The program will also include the development of tec hniques to realize ruggedized netw ork nodes and interconnecting f iber cables, which are strung along the ground, buried in the ground and/or in riverbed s or other waterways.

Narrative Title program will develop a proof of concept system th at will enable multiple users' access to 100 kilobits per second (kbps) satcom channels using the existing C- band satellite architecture. This new capability becomes possible, in part, by mov ing away from the existing paradigm regarding usage of these satellites. This new SATCOM CX paradigm envisions satellites as merely a node or re lay for a single user. In communications terminology, the satellite is part of a single-input/single-out put (SISO) channel. Instead, this prog ram will consider the multiple satellites simultaneously. Using this approach, a multit ude of co-channel users sends signals that illuminate a multi tude of satellites. Powerful processing algorithms then isolate the individual commun ication links. Using the cons tellation in this manner provide s signal gain and interference rejection. (U) The most important advantage for military missions is the abilit y to use the existing C-band uplink infrastructure with antenna aperture areas several orders of magnitude smaller than are currently n eeded. The large size of current C-band ground station antennas is driven by the need to limit adjacent satellite interference ra ther than the need for additional link margin.

The FCS program embraces an evolutionary acquisition, spiral development process. The program allows for continuous capability upgrad es through the introduction of new, enabling technologies througho ut the development phase. This Joint DARPA/Army activity supports the FCS spiral process through the development of critical technolo gy improvements for FCS BCT platform variants and the Network. Th e resulting network-centric SoS will continue to provide the Uni t of Action overwhelming lethality, strategic deployability, self-sustainme nt, and high survivability over other conventional ground forces .

(U) The Future Combat Systems MultiCell and Dismounted Command a nd Control program enabled expe rimentation with advanced command and control information technology. MultiCell emulates the functionality of an entire tactical combined arms force. T he program incorporates both unmanned air and ground robotic platforms, hea dquarters working at the operational level, and human dismounts . MultiCell also provides commanders with recommended interface functions a nd workload allocations. MultiCell validates the understanding of the dynamics of complex warfighting organizations thus defining comm ander interface layouts, functions and displays for maximum fle xibility and effectiveness. This program recommends capability enhancements supporting technol ogy for the nomination of information sources and supports visualization of current and future operational states. Mu ltiCell enables commanders to successf ully prosecute future command and control operations with significantly reduced staff. DARPA established an MOA with the Army for this program in August 2003. The Mult iCell Command and Control technology transitioned to the Army at the conclusion of Phase II, completed in FY 2006. (U) The Maneuver C3 program will develop robust, assured and po tentially high data rate connectivity for the Future Combat Systems Brigade Combat Team (FCS BCT) elements along with a command and control architecture to reduce the number of forward deployed Command a nd Control (C2) operators. The communications component will develop an integrated architecture th at provides for a seamless transition from line- of-sight to non-line-of-sight communications. To enable this functionality, development of new secure waveforms, directional a ntennas and mobile ad hoc networks will be initiated. The C2 component will directly leverage the Army's investment in the automation of the Battlefield Functional Areas within the Army Battle Command System (ABCS). Because of the multitude of single aspect systems that feed inf ormation in ABCS, large amounts of data are made available to the commander, thus requiring a much larger st aff of operators and workstatio n analysts to complete the fusion function of battlefield data into informa tion for the commander to make decisions. Future operations invol ving FCS technologies and operational capabilities cannot be restricted by a less responsive C2 architecture and large support staffs.

While efforts under the current phase have been successful, the Army has notifie d OAV contractors that it does not plan t o pursue further development of this vehicle. (U) The MAV ACTD program developed and integrated MAV technologies into militarily useful and affo rdable backpackable systems suitable for dismounted soldier, Marine, and Special Forces missi ons. The ACTD focused on the development of lift augmented du cted fan MAVs to accomplish unique military missions, particularly the hove r and stare capability in restricted environments. The syste m provides the small unit with militarily useful real-time combat information of difficult to observe and/or distant areas or objects. The sy stem will also be employable in a variety of war fighting environments (for exam ple: in complex topologies such as mountainous terrain, urban are as, and confined spaces). The MAV ACTD program sought to get DARPA-developed sma ll, Vertical Take - Off and Landing (VTOL) UAVs rapidly into th e hands of the users for evaluation and evolution of the technologi es; to develop tactics, techniques and procedures; and to prov ide a residual operational capability to active duty forces. The FCS MAV technolog y will transfer to the Army during FY 2007, at the conclusi on of the ACTD user experimentation. (U) The FCS laser radar (LADAR) Support (JIGSAW Phase III) program is developing advanced LADAR sensor systems and technologies for foliage penetration.

FORE STER is a UHF-band FOPEN GMTI ra dar designed to operate on rotary wing platforms such as the A-160 unmanned he licopter. For GMTI operation, the helicopter flies into the w ind to maintain near-zero ground speed. The goal is to detect dismounted troops under foliage at 30 km range under calm to low surface wind sp eeds. The program employs adaptive processing and innovative radar waveform s to overcome radio frequency in terference and electronic coun termeasures in hostile electromagnetic environments. The FORESTER technology is planned for transition to the Army at the conclusion of Ph ase III anticipated to be completed by FY 2008. (U) The goal of the Affordable Adaptive Conformal ESA Radar (A ACER) Program is to devel op a high performance radar and communication system for Class IV unmanned helicopters such as the A-160. The Ka-band radar will provide airborne, all-weather , day-night Synthetic Aperture Radar reconnaissance, wi de area Ground Moving Target Indication (GMT I) surveillance, dismount detection, and target acquisition and designation for precision fires. It will provide this information directly to the Unit of Action commander via an interleaved data link through the same antenna. The program will develop Electroni cally Scanned Array (ESA) technol ogy in a small Ka-band anten na. The combination of platform and radar characteristics will provide fo r persistent surveillance including that in urban areas, with a minimum discernable velocity of 1 mph. The technologies being develope d include: (1) affordable radar devices such as phase shifting e lements and power amplifiers/combiners which opera te at Ka band; (2) miniature receiver/exciter modules generating very broadband waveforms; (3) signal processing algorithms to support multiple functions simultaneously a nd detect and track dismounts. Use of existing signal and data processing hardware and software will allow an early flight demonstration of the entire system on an A-160 or surrogate aircraft. If succ essful, this program will provide a vastly improved intelligence and targeting capabilit y for local commanders by providing a dedicated, rapidly tas kable asset with surveillance of most of their battlespace, including areas inaccessible or obscured to larger airborne assets. DARPA negotiate d an MOA with the Army for this program in August 2005, and the AACER technology is planned for trans ition to the Program Executive Office - Inte lligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO-IEW&S) at the conclusion of Phase III in FY 2008.

The Network-Centric Situation Assessment pr ogram develops and deploys technologies to assess military situations at levels of i nterest above individual targets. The program uses all-source data to reconstruct unit organizations , mission relationships, logistics connections, and communications connectivity and analyzes data over time to infer movement, communicat ion, and supply patterns. Within this context, capability analyses are provided and future courses of action are hypothesized. The objective is to understand potent ial capabilities and intentions of opposing forces. This effort provides greater understanding of opponents' force structures, cap abilities, and operational practices, and then enables comma nders to sustain effects-based targeting rather than simple attrition strategies. The program provides a context for discovering vulnerabilities in opposing fo rces and provides cues for intellig ence, surveillance, and rec onnaissance planning, as it suggests areas of future enemy activity that mer it intense scrutiny. Technologies are planned to transition to the U.S. Army Distributed Common Ground Station. The Joint Mission Rehearsal program integrates high-fidelity; ma inframe-based combat simulations with situation assessment and planning tools. The objective is to allow rehearsal of joint mi ssions, while participants are en route to operations or remain at their home stations. The program uses current situa tion data to: (1) provide initial conditions for the simulations, and (2) plan data to steer the dynamics of the simulations along the selected courses of action. The technology streams data from the simulations for display , then visualization systems are available to the prospective participan ts. The visualization permits the warfighter to interact with the simulation in a manner consistent with their anticip ated role in the mission being rehearsed. The program delivers the capability to prac tice and fine- tune mission plans for joint military operations and enables co mmanders and staff to participate from their current location in stead of a training facility, thereby reducing deployment needs while im proving mission planning and effectiveness.

The program in cludes detection and tracking of potential enemy targets, discrimination and identification of friendl y versus enemy units, sorting of enemy from neutral and non-combatant personnel, co ordination of sensing, maneuver, and fires, and contin uous assessment of results. PUCS will utilize technologies including: smart networks o f distributed imaging and non-imaging sensors; sensors with the capability to de tect hidden human targets; improved 3D visualization systems, and multi- spectral discrimination systems that survey the battlefield for weapon activity and detect primary signatures. These capabilit ies will be developed within the framework of both legacy forces and expected future forces. The program will provide a set of prototype demonstrati ons of the capabilities in surrogate urban combat environments. Technologies ar e planned to transition to the U.S. Special Operations Com mand. The Smart Dust Sensor Networks Applied to Urban Area Operations program will provide persistent staring reconnaissance, surveil lance, and target acquisition of the three-dimensional urban battlespace using a dense network of ground sensors. The system concept consists of ubiquitous and inconspicuous low-power, sma ll and easily concealed ground sensors dist ributed throughout the urban landscape. The program includes the development of ultra small sensor nodes for e asy deployment and concealment in a crowded urban environment and data fusion algorithms to exploit the abundance of new informati on provided by a dense urban spatial network. The program will create a self organizing system that will integrate and exploit reliable ne tworks of low-cost, small, a nd long-lifetime sensor nodes pro viding the capability for monitoring secured areas (e.g., buildings) and provi ding situational awareness to warfighters (e.g., checkpoints and sniper fire), and intelligence applications such as wide-area persistent surveillance of road ways and major arteries (e.g., for Improv ised Explosive Devices (IED) emplacement), perimeters, and even city wide areas. The program technologies will transition to the Army. The Networked Acoustic-Visual Imaging System (NAVIS) (formerly Head Mounted Alerting for Urban Operations) program will develop a networked weapon fire detection system using infrared sensor imagery fused with acoustic senso r information for precise local ization of the source of weapon fire. The NAVIS system is a soldier-borne sensor array that moves with the dismounted unit, continually a dapting to the dynamic threat situation in urban operations.

The challenge of this initiative is to provide a moving networked sensor array, borne by dismounted warfighter s, with near real-time visualization of the fused firing event data for immediate response and accurate pointing. The Exploiting Vibrations to Monitor Activities in Buildings pr ogram will develop procedures and sensors to characterize activi ty inside structures based on acoustic/seismic information. The types of information sought include numbe r and location of personnel, fo ot traffic, operation of building mechanicals (ventilation, cooling, and hea ting; plumbing; etc.) as an indicator of human activity, operat ion of other machinery, door openings and closings, and speech. Algorithms th at infer internal layout of the building from the pattern and location of these activities will be investigated along w ith the fusing of the information from othe r surveillance information gained by ot her sensing modalities. The Total RF Detection and Ranging (TORDAR) program will address radar deficiencies due to discontinuous bandwidth: reduced ran ge coverage, denial in certain geographic regi ons, interoperability issues, and reduced ra nge resolution. This will involve a sys tem-wide redesign of radar optimized over the full RF spectrum, not indivi dual stove-piped tasks. It will include the integration of sp arse bandwidth returns (including passive signals of opportunity), adaptive tran smitter and waveform diversity, and agile frequency diverse ha rdware. It will also use all RF and radar resources more intelligently to f ill gaps in knowledge as opposed to re-deriving situational awa reness with every new radar processing interval. This capability will fac ilitate both manned and unmanned ai rborne Intelligence, Surveilla nce and Reconnaissance (ISR). The Urban Ops Hopper program will develop a semi-autonomous hybrid hopping/articulated wh eeled robotic platform that could adap t to the urban environment in real-time and provide both surgical leth ality and/or ISR to any point of the urban jungle while remain ing lightweight, small and expendable to minimize the burden on the soldier. In general, small robots or unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) are severely limited by obstacle negotiation capability. The de monstrated hopping capability allows small UGVs to overcome obs tacles 40-60 times their own size. Hopping will extend robot navigati on to six degree-of-freedom situa tional location and mapping. H opping mobility can be shown to be 5 times more efficient than hovering for obstacles at heights less than or equal to 10 meters. The proposed hopping robot would be truly multi-functional in that it will negotiate all aspects of the urban battlefield to deliver ISR and /or lethal payloads to non-line-of-sight targets with precision. The artic ulated wheel design allows the robot to negotiate short range o bstacles for precision placement in difficult terrain. 379UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Network-Centric Warfare Technology PE 0603766E, Project NET-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 54 Page 10 of 26 (U) Program Plans: Smart Dust Sensor Networks A pplied to Urban Area Operations -- Develop miniaturized sensors based on Networ k Embedded Systems Technology (NEST) concept. -- Develop and demonstrate technologies to separate targets from background. -- Develop battlefield activity alert logic. -- Conduct demonstration at a representative MOUT site.

These techniques use all-source info rmation to continuously update models of urban networks. U sing the models, operational objectives for urban interventions, expressed in terms of desired and undesire d effects will be generated. The technology will then use these objectives to find vulnerabilities in the networks, nominating targets for prosecution to maximize desired effec ts while minimizing undesired effects. Further, the program will develop techniqu es for predicting those observables that will rapidly identify an opponent's response when several courses of action are available. In particular , the program will focus on radio frequency networks: identifying transmitters, receivers, and links between them. The pr ogram will apply advanced beam forming t echnologies to provide co-channel interferenc e cancellation for densely deployed cellular telephone or WiFI services in an ur ban environment. From this understanding of the network topol ogy, courses of action for precision jamming or flooding attacks can be assessed, including determination of effects on downstream components ( subscribers to the network).

While technology for detection, tracking, and destruction of these platforms exists, the destruction step is problematic sinc e the process can inadvertently di sperse the toxic agent over t he intended (or other) targets. A means for safely, effectively, and inexpensively se questering chemical payloads, a nd transporting these payloads to the ground, is a critical need. This program focuses on the development of a system, which integrates the tracking and detection capabilities w ith gentle methods of entombment (i.e., quarantine) of the active agent. Such met hods include use of rapidly expanding polymer foams or rheology- changing fluids, which form a rugged, impermeable cocoon that effectively isolates the agent (or the entire vehicle) from the environment. Alte rnative methods, including collecting the agent into a trap , are also possible. Significant technical obstacles include achieving rapid and com plete encapsulation (or entrapment), robustness toward countermeasur es (including on-board explosives), and th e gentle transport of the encapsulated pa ckage to the ground. Potential transition targets include SOCOM, Army, and Marines. (U) Program Plans: Develop strategies and system architecture for entombme nt of UAV-borne chemical and biological agents.

Improvements in communications between and amo ng submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to opera te seamlessly with each other and with other Service's netwo rk centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their uniqu e capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea a nd their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and pr oject-sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on th ese attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.

Pe rsistent Ocean Surveillance-Station Keeping technology is planned for transition to the Navy. (U) The Aluminum Combustor program seeks to develop an energy-den se air-independent underwater power source as a potential propulsi on system for underwater vehicles. This program will optimize the design for a small combustor and develop the auxiliary power sy stem components needed to control and sustain operations. In addition to the combustor, the aluminum fuel feed subsystem, aluminum-steam separ ator subsystem; and closed loop control subsystem will be d esigned, built, and tested and integrated with a turbine in order to successfully de monstrate a power system in a laboratory environment. The Aluminum Combus tor technology is anticipated to transition to the Navy. (U) Early entry maritime forces need maps of morphology, water dept hs, and currents in complex riveri ne/estuarine environments for mission planning and execution. This information is critical for rout e planning, sensor placement, rendezvous determination, vulnerabi lity assessments, and for determining objective assault engagement/disengagement stra tegies. For uncharted and/or denied areas, present methods are inadequate for obtaining the necessary information. Reliable remote sensing methods do not exist that produ ce bathymetry and water curren t data in waters that are sediment laden (bottom is not visible) and/or shelte red (swell and significant wind waves are not likely). The River Eye effort will provide a new capability to predict or assess, in real time, river and estuary conditions to enable special operations mission planning and execution. New techniques will be developed to indirectly determine current sp eed and direction by remotely sensing advection of scene feature s. Using advanced modeling techniques, indirectly sensed current data will be used to extract bathymetry data. Forward circulation models will u se the bathymetry data to predict future currents and water heights in a mission planning decision support tool.

These models enable the evaluation of multiple sensor/targeting concepts, and drive requirements for highly sens itive, advanced sensors, which ope rate at very low frequencies in order to reach deeply buried structures. The CUGF Unattended Ground Sensor Syst em (CUGSS), demonstrated the u se of multiple, networked ground nodes of multi-phenomenological sensors (EM, acoustic, seismic) for UGF monito ring and target characterization. Another element, Efflue nts for Vent Hunting, has evaluated the feasibility of finding vents from sta nd-off locations by exploiting th e spatial, spectral, and tempo ral characteristics of the exhaust plumes. The Low-Altitude Airbor ne Sensor System (LAASS) is demonstrati ng the use of airborne EM, acoustic, and gra vity sensors to rapidly find UGFs and map out their backbone structure. Techniques are also being developed for finding and mapping traces and portals of small tunnels used for movement among large facilities or build ings, and for surreptitiously crossing borders and security boun daries. The Cross- Border Tunnel (CBT) program is using seismic and electromagnetic tomography to detect and localize small tunnels. The Remote I nterconnected Tunnel Assessment (RITA) program demonstrated stand-off hyperspectral sensing to dete rmine portals and vents that are connected by tunnels underground. Other potential technologies to be included are precision thermal imaging and active surface seismic and electrom agnetic approaches. These are particularly useful for small, relatively shallow, unimproved tunnels.

Its products are installed on platforms that operate on the ground (HUMVEE, convoy elements) and near the ground (helicopters). They employ technologies that defeat or compensate for the unusual atmospheri c conditions near the surface (t urbulence, dust, strong propag ation losses) in order to provide timely and accurate detection and classification of dismounts, small vehicles, and terrain obstacles. Program s in this thrust include: The SandBlaster program is developing a passive pilot enhancemen t system that fuses visible, infrared (IR) and millimeter wave radiation to enable multiple helicopters to land safely in conditions of severe brown- and white-out. SandBlaster will exploit the low a ttenuation property of dust (fog and snow) on millimeter wave radiation.

Program efforts focus on expl oiting emergent and novel radar sensing technology and phenomenology. Key elements are advancements in ultra-wide band, bistatics, UHF/VHF, polari metric change detection, tomographic imaging, space-time adaptive pr ocessing and other advanced signal processing, advanced Ground Mov ing Target Indication techniques, and foliage, building- penetrating, and ground-penetrating radar phenomenology.

Programs in this thrust include: The Augmented Aerial Sentry (AAS) program develops a rapidly-deployable airborne sy stem to provide assured protection of perman ent or temporary U.S. base camps in hostile territory. AAS includ es ground-based, wide area sensors in conjunction with air platfo rms to maintain continuous surveillance of the area around the camp, dete cting potential intruders or weapon launches. The suite of a irborne sensor platforms can be tasked locally to investigate potential th reats; lock on to personnel or weapons involved in an attack; allow commanders to confirm threats; or authorize precision weapons to engage them. Technologies are planned for transition to the A ir Force and Army. The Sensing and Exploitation of Urban Movers (SE-UM) (formerly Bipedal Detection) progr am develops technology for the detection of dismounted troops in combat situations usi ng airborne radars. SE-UM develops the cap ability to detect, classify, track and rec ognize the behavior of human beings using radar data. Existing radars that have been shown to allow this capability under ideal circumsta nces; those under development will, either fortuitously or by design, more c onsistently obtain detections from individuals. SE-UM will exp loit these data by detecting each individual, classify ing the individual as human and according to their speed and gait, tracking many ind ividuals (forward and backwards in time) and automatically recognizing co mmon, anomalous and significant actions/behaviors. Challenges include detection of motion below the minimum discernable veloc ity of the radar system, and discernment of multiple moving obje cts within a single beam width. Using SE-UM on data from appropriate ly designed airborne radar the system could observe human moti on over an entire urban region. SE-UM technologies will transition to the airborne systems deployed by the Air Force and Navy. The NetTrack program will extend capabilities for persistent track ing and targeting of moving vehi cles from airborne radars. N etTrack will improve capabilities in two ways: the system will network radars together and use advanced radar techniques to gather \"sig natures\" of vehicles. The signatures, which are collections of radar featur es, will be stored and passed over the radar network. The syst em will compare vehicle signatures taken before and after confusing events to maintain the tr ack of the target vehicles. Extended long -term airborne radar tracking will be an important long-range, all-weather, capability. It will extend the kill chain to enable vehi cle engagement hours after target designation, enable behavioral analysis of ve hicle movements to gauge enemy operational structure, force com position, and intentions, and provide a higher level of situational awareness at every level. Technologies are planned for transition to the Navy, Army and Air Force. 418UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 55 Page 23 of 34 The Dual Beam Lynx program will enhance the capabilities of the Lynx radar system to track slow-moving vehicles more accurately . The program modifies a Lynx I radar to create two beams with diffe rent phase centers and uses space time adaptive processing to det ect moving targets in the main beam clutter. The goals of this pr ogram include demonstrating improve ment in minimal detectable vel ocity, improving geolocation accuracy, and achieving a low manufacturing co st. The radar performance will be demonstrated from flight data collected from the radar flying on a UAV surrogate.

Narrative Title FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Target Identification Technology 16.998 17.000 17.000 20.000 (U) The Target Identification Technology thrust develops semiautoma tic methods to identify targets from sensors operating in all sp ectral bands. Its objective is to detect, characterize, and identif y military threats, and to assess the environment around them. Da ta sources include national, theater, and organic sensors. Critical performance metr ics are timeliness, accuracy, error rates, and interpretation workload. The thrust addresses the challenges of target identification, acquisition an d tracking under restrictive rules of engagement. The technol ogies will apply advanced signal processing and machine vision to leverage adva nces in sensor capabilities. Progr ams in this thrust include: The Tactical Sensor Network Technologies (TSNT) program develops detection, tracking, identification, and pattern analysis capa bilities that operate in all nodes (fixed or mobile) within a networked, distributed multi-sens or system. The processing to be performe d at each network node depends on the sensors reporting to that node, the subscribing commanders, and resource management decisions. TSN T exploits locality of sensing, but will leve rage the advantages of a self-forming adaptive network for signal processing. Algor ithms are designed to be aware of the sensor network and adapt their pr ocessing algorithms based on self-discovered network topology. Th e algorithms also take into account power ma nagement constraints, communications bandwid th limitations, and constraints found in the local environment. TSNT is resilient to the failure of any node while maintaining sufficient consistency to support commanders ' collaborative tactical planning. Technologies are planne d to be transitioned to the U.S. Army (PEO IEWD). The Exploitation of 3-D Data (E3D) program has developed tec hniques for rapidly exploiting 3-D sensor data. The initial progra m effort consisted of three distinct processes: Target Acquisition, Targ et Recognition, and Modeling. The resulting software tools were integrated into operational ground stations processing 3-D sensor data. The E3D technology was transitioned to SOCOM in FY 2006. The 3D 420UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 55 Page 25 of 34 Reasoning (3DR) initiative is a follow-on program to E3D which will develop techniques to automatically generate large, fully a nnotated 3D urban models from the rich sources of high-resolution laser ra dar data available from ground-based and airborne platforms. 3DR extends vehicle-centric automated target recognition methods to support the much broader class of objects accessible in urban a nd complex terrain - particularly side-looking sensors mounted on patr ol vehicles. The program consists of four distinct componen ts: (1) new methods to rapidly and precisely co-regist er 3D and 2D data from disparate ground a nd airborne sources; (2) new 3D recognition approaches that identify objects within a class based on limited initial training; (3) a flexible and expandable 3D database st ructure to support the highly detailed and evol ving urban models and provide the basis for ge ometry-based queries; and (4) a user interfac e that provides rapid and flexible access to the data. The resulting software tools and modeling capabilities will be integrated into future command posts and operational SOCOM and Army units in the field at the conclusion of the program anticipated to be completed in FY 2011. The All-Source Target Characterization program develops a colle ction and measurement capability to characterize new targets as they emerge on the battlefield. This effort develops tools to perm it rapid user interaction with imagery, sensor data, and processi ng results and provides real-time feedback to operators indicating target key features and other discriminates. The technology provides tools to process and disseminate target signatures to the field in usable form ats for direct insertion into operational systems and enhances ope rator interfaces with extant analysis workstations to allow on-the-fl y collection of signature data with little/no intervention for t he operator. Technologies are planned for transition to the Air Force Distributed Common Ground Station in FY 2009. The Detect UAV program develops techniques to detect, track, a nd characterize small UAVs that are easily built, inexpensive, ea sy to operate, and offer the asymmetric adversary an ability to reach into well-defended locations causing potentially large amounts of damage. It includes signal processing techniques to detect small air targ ets in radar, video, acoustic, and passive radio-frequency int ercepts; to correlate those data with known objects (e.g ., civilian aircraft); to analyze the moti on of any uncorrelated data; and to rapid ly task narrow- field-of-view sensors to collect more-detailed data. It will tran sition to the Army in FY 2010 to meet both static force prote ction needs and tactical air defense operations.

Narrative Title FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Pattern Analysis Technology 15.000 13.000 9.000 8.000 (U) The Pattern Analysis Technology thrust develops exploitation tool s to form and analyze tracks of vehicle movement, and distingu ish hostile behavior from benign civilian activities. It develops tools for movement patte rn analysis, algorithms to predict targe t motions, and dynamic control methods for sensor tasking and observation sch eduling. Programs in this thrust include: The Video Verification and Identification (VIV ID) program develops technology to automa te moving target strike operations for r emotely piloted aircraft (RPA). Program products support both precision strike operations and military surveillance. VIVID enables th e handoff of targets between wide area coverage Intelligence, Surveillan ce, and Reconnaissance systems and local video surveillance platf orms. The technology provides techniques for precision target identification in video including fingerprinting techniques and related tec hnology to permit reacquiring previously observed vehicles. The program al so features techniques enabling video sensors to autonomously a nd simultaneously track multiple vehicular target s through dense traffic, temporary occlusion or exit from sensor field of view, i n military surveillance and strike operations, and suppor ts target detection of moving vehicles a nd/or dismounts in very low resolutions. VIVID significantly advances the capabilities of vide o surveillance and moving target strike for numerous military missions, includin g military operations in foreign urban areas. DARPA has established a MOA with the Air Force to transition the VIVID technology to the Pr edator. The VIVID technology is planned for transiti on at the conclusion of Phase II which is an ticipated to be completed by the end FY 2008. The Dynamic Tactical Targeting (DTT) program develops sensor control and data fusion t echnologies to enable warfighters to mana ge a process to find, identify, track, target, a nd destroy mobile, time sensitive targets. Current targeting tec hnology is too slow to maintain target track and support prosecution of these fleeting targets. DTT is designing and demonstrating a system that: 1) leverages existing 423UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 55 Page 28 of 34 National/Theater Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) processes for timely extraction of critical data; 2) fuse s organic sensor data with ISR data from all sources to continuously estimat e target location, identity, and activity; 3) dynamically tas ks standoff, organic, and embedded sensors to fill ISR c overage gaps and provide relevant sensor observation in areas of tactical interest; and 4) processes and manages the voluminous data produced by various sen sors in time to provide the warfighter information required to prosecute time-sensitive targets. The DTT technology is planned for transition to the Air Force in FY 2008 after a series of t ests conducted with the Air Force Transformation Center. The Forensic Target Motion Analysis program develops and demonstrates exploitation tools to analyze Ground Moving Target Indica tor Radar tracks of multiple targets to separate militarily-interesti ng target movement (infiltrators, envelopments, defensive site preparation, logistics support) from nominal background traffic (e.g. civilians, coalition operations). It develops libraries of movement p atterns, logic to generate hypotheses about which patterns are being observed, algorithms to correlate sensor data to those patterns, and mech anisms to quantitatively score the consistency of the da ta with each hypothesis. It also includes tools to provide short-term (5-10 minu te) predictions of target motions, thereby supporting some forms of predictive thr eat analysis. The tools will be integrated into Distributed Common Ground Stations in FY 2010.

Narrative Title FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Network Centric Sensing and Engagement 20.683 19.662 13.000 12.361 (U) The Network Centric Sensing and Engagement thrust develops technology and tools to s upport precise situational awareness, rapid targeting, and precision engagement in hi ghly-networked environments. Network-centr ic sensing acknowledges a group of sensors as a system and leverages networked inte rcommunication to enable system performance superi or to that of uncoordinated individual sensors. Applications include advanced target detection, acquisition, tracking, and comb at identification. The technology is suited to both ground-b ased sensors and airborne multi-ship sensor systems. Exploiting the potential of network-centric sensing requires a number of approaches. Requ ired technology advances include: sensor-to-sensor manage ment, sensor system georegistration, real-time data fusio n, advanced tracking, and network-centric sensor operational modes. Programs in this thrust include: 425UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 55 Page 30 of 34 The Camouflaged Long Endurance Nano-Sensors (C LENS) program develops low-cost, lightwei ght micro-sensors to detect, geolocate, track, and classify targets in difficult environments. The syst em leverages ultra-wideband radio technologies developed for ad vanced communications. The combination of active, coherent, distri buted-network sensing offers unique capabilities not possible from stand- alone, single-point systems. CLENS enables reduced force protec tion and supports monitoring of borders and critical CONUS site s, and long-duration covert monitoring of target sites such as terrorist camps. CLENS has broad application in support of comprehensi ve intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissan ce for situational awareness and enables pe rsistent sensing of dismounted combatant s in forested areas and other tough environments. The CLENS technology is planned for transition to the SOCOM at the conclusion of Phase III anticipated to be completed by FY 2007. The Quint Networking Technology (QNT) is a modular, multi-band, network data link program focused on providing capabilities tha t close the seams between five nodes - aircraft, unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV), weapons, tactical unmanned air vehicles (UA V's) and air control ground units. The program designs, develops, ev aluates and demonstrates robust, affordable data link technolog ies suitable for use by weapons, tactical UAV's, and air control units. This includes shrinking the package size of data link capabilities from the current 1000 in3 to 10 in3, the size of a cell phone. These data links enable precisi on strike and efficient machine-to-machine targeting against time critical and mobile targets, support combat identifi cation of targets, disseminate tactical UAV and ground sensor data, and provide bomb impact assessment (BIA). The data links allow secu re weapon handoff from the launch platform to any of several co ntrol platforms in the combat area, both air and surface. The QNT units provide two modes: a low rate bi-directional mode and a high data rate mode capable of either continuous or a bu rst imagery/video transmission. Dynamic net resource management technology will scale to support hundreds of vehicles in flight. Advanced information security techniques provide secure weapon data links and controll er handovers. QNT technology transitions via insertion into DoD's ex isting and emerging weapons, tacti cal UAV's, and tactical han dheld units after the program is completed in FY 2008. The Target Geolocation from a UAV (GeoLoc) program uses novel photogrammetric techniques to provide accurate geolocation of ground targets (<10 meters CEP) from small and mid-size UAVs. Th is represents an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy compared to instrumentation used on high-end UAVs. Further it requires no new hardware on-board the aircraft and does not rely upon prepared reference imagery. This photog rammetric technology will permit UAVs to not only observe targets for the first time, b ut also to direct fire from coordinate-seeking weapons. Furthermore, the technology will be extended to provide real-time geolocation on moving vehicles as well, enabling engagement of moving targets without us e of laser designators, and without any human operators in ha rms way. 426UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 55 Page 31 of 34 The thrusts and future capabilities of the GeoLoc Program are: de tection, precision identification, tracking, and destruction o f elusive surface targets from networked manned and unmanned systems. Technologies are planned for transition to the Air Force. The Wide Area Video Exploitation program w ill develop technology to enable wide fiel d-of-view visible and infrared imagery (EO/ IR) framing cameras in airborne platforms to detect and track, in real time, multiple moving objects under a wide range of conditio ns and topography. Current systems are able to collect data and provid e an ability to backtrack individual targets post-facto. The S onoma-Plus program aims to provide a real-time ability to track in forward time multiple poten tial targets from high-altitude video imager y. On-board processing will be crucial since imagery data volumes will amount to gigabytes per second. Multi-hypothesis tracking of dozens and eventually hundreds of entities will also be developed, and imagery stabilization b ased on prior digital elevation models will also facilitate tracking and track analysis. Technologies are planned for transition to the Army.

Narrative Title FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Persistent Exploitation 19.591 20.262 20.632 23.178 (U) The new Persistent Exploitation program integrates a wide variet y of sensors, data links, exploitation tools, correlators, and pattern analyzers into an end-to-end capability, focusing on counter-insurgency missions. These missions must be supported at all hour s of the day, over large areas, and against a diverse set of targets, characteris tics that no homogeneous sensor architecture can address. It tie s separate hardware and software components together so that interactions among them can be defined, assessed, evaluated, and refined. It emphasizes r eal-time testing in realistic environments (e.g., the National Training Centers) so that subtle dependencies and inte ractions can be discovered. (U) The Persistent Operational Surface Surveillan ce and Engagement (POSSE) program creates a system of systems framework in which a mix of surveillance assets, both operational and developmental can be c oordinated and exploited to yield persistent surveillanc e of insurgent activities. The program focus is on the Iraqi theatre, using a sp iral approach designed to insert enhanced counter-insurgency capabilities into operational use as soon as possible, followed by improvements and e nhancements as they become integrated through a domestic tes tbed. The efficacy and timeliness of surveillance affo rded by the program's systems-level appr oach will significantly exceed that afforde d by individual ISR components, and will result in substantially enhanced force pr otection for fixed sites, convoys , and military operations. The framework includes data exploitation at both forw ard-deployed and national sites to support both qu ick-reaction cuing to engage insurgents, and de eper forensic 428UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 55 Page 33 of 34 analysis to identify their support structures. The POSSE program is jointly funded with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Task Force. POSSE technologies are planned for transition to th e U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command.

(U) The Guidance Technology project will increase the ability of Global Positioning System (GPS) users to operate effectively in th e presence of enemy jamming; to increase the versatility of navigation systems applications by de veloping microelectromechanical sensor in ertial navigation system technologies; and to apply the geolocation technologies /techniques to precision threat geolocation of short-dwell emitte rs or passive air defense systems. Fire-and-forget standoff weapons need precise targeting information if critical fixed and mobile targets are to be eliminated effectively with minimal collateral damage and minimum cost-pe r-kill. This requires that: (1) military surveillance and targe ting systems geolocate targets accurately in the same coordinate system in wh ich the weapon system navigates; (2) the surveillance, targetin g and weapon systems have precision navigation and guidance systems on-board; and (3) navigation and target location systems robustly operat e day/night and in adverse weather.

This requires that: (1) military surveillance and targeting systems geolocate targets accurately in the same coordinate system in which the weapon syst em navigates; (2) the surveillan ce, targeting and weapon syste ms have precision navigation and guidance systems on-board; and (3) navigation and ta rget location systems robustly operate day/night and in adve rse weather. In addition, future systems designed to accomplish precision strike mi ssions must be significantly more affordable. Thrusts are i ncluded in this project to improve our ability to navigate when the Global Pos itioning System (GPS) is jammed or otherwise unavailable; to incr ease the versatility of navigation systems applicati ons by developing microelectromechanical sensor inertial navigation system technolog ies; and to apply to precision threat geolo cation of short-dwell emitters or passive air defense systems.

The RSN/SSN program will use signals of opportunity and specia lized signals from a variety of ground-, air-, and space-based so urces and judiciously placed low frequency RF beacons ; these will be received on the Warfighter's forthcoming software defined radios, an d will use specially tailored algorithms to determine position. Other signals such as the Earth' s magnetic field (micro deviations), cycl ic variations in the Earth's gravitational field due to tidal motion, will also be ev aluated. The greater strength and diversity of these signals w ill provide coverage when GPS is denied due to lack of penetr ation into buildings and unde rground, and when severe multipath is a problem. This is a two part program: (1) cataloging and assessing of potential exploitable signals followed by analysis and pe rformance modeling and hardwa re-based concept validation and (2) designing, testing, and demonstrating of a (non-form-fit) prototype receiver(s) and algorithms for geolocati on using the signals 435UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2007 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Guidance Technology PE 0603768E, Project GT-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 56 Page 6 of 8 of opportunity.

This same system will make real-time estimates of range and relative pos ition of objects in the scene, and will provide real-time positio n estimates outside under GPS-denied conditions in urban, m ountainous and foliated areas given access to a high-resolution terrain map of the area. This system would match small-scale features, such as shrubs, trees and sma ll buildings, to features in the map and provide real-time estim ates of the soldier's location within that map. The capability will be transitioned to the U.S. Army via PEO Soldier and USSOCOM starting in FY 2010 .
