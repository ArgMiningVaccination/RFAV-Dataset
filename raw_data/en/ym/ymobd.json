In her book on the nursing process, Alfaro- LeFevre (2006) describes the shift fromDiagnose and Treat (DT) to Predict, Prevent,Manage, and Promote (PPMP). The latterapproach focuses on early evidence-basedintervention to prevent and manage problemsand their potential complications.

In eachone, underline the cues that form a data clus-ter indicating a nursing diagnosis, and writethe appropriate nursing diagnosis as a three-part statement. a.Mr. Klinetob, age 86, has been seriouslydepressed since the death 6 months ago ofhis wife of 52 years. Although he suffersfrom degenerative joint disease and hastalked for years about having \"just a touchof arthritis,\" this never kept him frombeing up and about. Recently, however, hespends all day sitting in a chair and seemsto have no desire to engage in self-careactivities. He tells the visiting nurse that hedoesn't get washed up anymore becausehe's \"too stiff\" in the morning to bathe and\"I just don't seem to have the energy.\" Thevisiting nurse notices that his hair is mattedand uncombed, his face has traces of previ-ous meals, and he has a strong body odor.His children have complained that theirnormally fastidious father seems not to careabout personal hygiene any longer. Nursing Diagnosis: b.Miss Adams sustained a right-sided cerebral infarct that resulted in left hemiparesis(paralysis on the left side of the body) andleft \"neglect.\" She ignores the left side ofher body and actually denies its existence.When asked about her left leg, she statedthat it belonged to the woman in the nextbed\u2014this while she was in a private room.This patient was previously quite active:she walked for 45 to 60 minutes four or vetimes a week and was an avid swimmer. Atpresent, she cannot move either her leftarm or leg. Nursing Diagnosis: c.After trying to conceive a child for 11 years, Ted and Rosemary Hines sought the assistance of a fertility specialist whowas highly recommended by a friend. Itwas determined that Ted's sperm was inad- equate, and Rosemary was inseminatedwith sperm from an anonymous donor. Thecouple was told that the donor was healthyand that he was selected because he resem-bled Ted. Rosemary became pregnant afterthe second in-vitro fertilization attempt anddelivered a healthy baby girl named Sarah. Sarah is now 7 years old, and Ted and Rosemary have learned from blood teststhat their fertility specialist is the biologicLWBK696-C13_p66-71.qxd 9/2/10 9:25 AM Page 70 Aptara IncCHAPTER 13 Copyright \u00a9 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

It seems that he lied to some couples about using sperm fromanonymous donors and deceived othersinto thinking the wives had becomepregnant when he had simply injectedthem with hormones. Ted and Rosemaryhave joined other couples in pressingcharges against this physician. Rosemary tells the nurse in her pediatri- cian's ofce that she is concerned abouthow all this is affecting her family. \"Ted andI both love Sarah and would do nothing tohurt her, but I'm so angry about this wholesituation I'm afraid I may be taking it outon her,\" she says. Questioning reveals thatRosemary has found herself yelling at Sarahfor minor disobedience and spanking her,something she rarely did before. Both Tedand Rosemary had commented beforeabout Sarah's striking physical resemblanceto the fertility specialist but attributed thisto coincidence. Rosemary says, \"WheneverI see her now, I can't help but see Dr.Clowser, and everything inside me clenchesup and I want to scream.\" Both Ted andRosemary express great remorse that Sarah,who is innocent, is bearing the brunt ofsomething that is in no way her fault.

Scenario: Mrs. Chijioke, an 88-year-old woman who has lived alone for years, wasbrought to the hospital after neighbors foundher lying at the bottom of her cellar steps. Shehad broken her hip and underwent hip repairsurgery 3 days ago. The nurse assigned to carefor Mrs. Chijioke noticed during the patient'sbath that the skin of her coccyx, heels, andelbows was reddened. The skin returned to a normal color when pressure was relieved in these areas. There was no edema, nor wasthere induration or blistering. Although Mrs. Chijioke can be lifted out of bed into a chair, she spends most of the day in bed,lying on her back with an abductor pillowbetween her legs. At 5 feet tall and 89 pounds,Mrs. Chijioke looks lost in the big hospitalbed. Her eyes are bright, and she usuallyattempts a warm smile, but she has little phys-ical strength and lies seemingly motionless for hours. Her skin is wrinkled and paper thin, and her arms are bruised from unsuccess-ful attempts at intravenous therapy. She was dehydrated on admission because she had spent almost 48 hours crumpled at thebottom of her steps before being found by her neighbors, and she was clearly in need ofnutritional, fluid, and electrolyte support. A long-time diabetic, Mrs. Chijioke is nowspiking a fever (39.0/H11034C, or 102.2/H11034F), whichconcerns her nurse. 1.Identify pertinent patient data by placing asingle underline beneath the objective data inthe patient care study and a double underlinebeneath the subjective data. 2.Complete the Nursing Process Worksheet onpage 203 to develop a three-part diagnosticstatement and related plan of care for thispatient. 3.Write down the patient and personal nursingstrengths you hope to draw upon as you assistthis patient to better health.

Interview severalpatients to nd out how the lack of mobilityhas affected their lives. See if you can helpwith some of the exercise routines, and trysome of the exercises yourself. Develop a nurs-ing care plan to incorporate what you learnedabout mobility and exercise into your ownpatient care routine. 2.Using a partner, practice putting each otherinto the following positions: Fowler's, supine,prone, lateral side-lying, and Sims'. What didthis teach you about the experience of beingpositioned that will be helpful in yourpractice? Assess each position for health risksthat may arise from the following factors:comfort level, body alignment, and pressurepoints. Write down the advantages and disad-vantages of each position. 3.Try maneuvering on a busy street on crutchesor in a wheelchair. How does impaired mobil-ity affect your ability to perform everydaychores? How did the public react to yourimpaired mobility? What effects might apermanent disability have on patients, andhow can you promote their coping?

Scenario: Leroy Cobbs, age 56, was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. He is takingacetaminophen (Tylenol) with codeine forpain and is hospitalized for fecal impaction.During the physical examination, Mr. Cobbssays, \"Nobody told me I would get soconstipated. It's been almost a week and I'mstill not moving my bowels normally. I didn'tknow anything could hurt so bad!\" Mr. Cobbsreports that he had regular, pain-free bowelmovements, once daily, before taking the painmedication. He appears frustrated and says,\"I'll take my chances with the cancer pain inthe future rather than take more painmedicine and have this happen again.\"CHAPTER 38 BOWEL ELIMINATION 259 Copyright \u00a9 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

PATIENT CARE STUDY Read the following patient care study and use your nursing process skills to answer thequestions below. Scenario: Ms. Elgaresta, age 54, a single Hispanic woman, is being followed by a cardi-ologist who monitors her arrhythmia. Lastmonth, she started taking a new heart medica-tion. At this visit, she says to the nurse practi-tioner who works with the cardiologist: \"Rightafter I started taking that medication, I got terribly constipated, and nothing seems tohelp. I'm desperate and about ready to trydynamite unless you can think of somethingelse!\" She reports a change in her bowel move-ments from one soft stool daily to one or two hard stools weekly, stools that cause muchstraining. The nurse practitioner realizes thatregulating Ms. Elgaresta's heart is difcult andthat her best cardiac response to date has beenwith the medication that is now causing con-stipation. Reluctant to suggest substitutinganother medication too quickly, she asks morequestions and Ms. Elgaresta responds, \"I'venever been much of a drinker, 2 cups of coffeein the morning and maybe a glass of wine atnight. Water? Almost never. And I don't drinkjuices or soft drinks.\" Analysis of her dietreveals a diet low in ber: \"I never was onemuch for vegetables, and they can just keep allthis bran stuff that's out on the market! Coffeeand a cigarette. That's for me!\" Ms. Elgaresta is a workaholic computer programmer andspends what little spare time she has watchingTV. She reports tiring after walking one flightof stairs and says she avoids all forms of vigor-ous exercise. 1.Identify pertinent patient data by placing asingle underline beneath the objective data inthe case study and a double underline beneaththe subjective data. 2.Complete the Nursing Process Worksheet onpage 261 to develop a three-part diagnosticstatement and related plan of care for thispatient. 3.Write down the patient and personal nursingstrengths you hope to draw upon as you assistthis patient to better health.

The body responds to acid-base imbalances by activating compensatory mechanisms that minimize pH changes; a metabolic disturbance is compensated by the lungs, and a respiratory system disturbance is compensated by the kidneys. Any pH less than 7.35 /H11005 state of acidosis. Any pH greater than 7.45 /H11005 state of alkalosis. C O 2is an acid; HCO 3is a base. Any change in CO 2reflects a respiratory change. Any change in HCO 3reflects a metabolic change. If the pH has returned to normal, compensation has taken place. If the primary event is a fall in pH, whether respiratory or metabolic in origin, the arterial pH stays on the acidside after compensation. If the primary event is an increase in pH, whether respiratory or metabolic in origin, the arterial pH stays on the base side after compensation.LWBK696-C40_p272-282.qxd 9/3/10 12:35 PM Page 275 Aptara Inc1.Mr. W. is a 90-year-old man who had a successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation a fewhours 55-year-old woman is admitted with 4.Mrs. S. is a 55-year-old woman with heart fail-ure 21-year-old woman who was found by her friends on the floor of her room.

Theseitems could include things such as a key, acotton ball, a toothpick, a tongue depressor,and so on. Have your friends take turns feel-ing the objects in the bag and guessing whatthey are without looking at them. As anitem is identied, remove it from the bag.Discuss the importance of tactile experiencesto the vision-impaired patient. b.Gather several foods for your friends totaste and identify. You could use pudding,gelatin, mints, chocolate, and so on. Blind-fold your friends and give them a taste ofeach food. See how many they can identifycorrectly. c.Gather items with a pungent odor for yourfriends to smell and identify. You could usealcohol, lemon juice, pickle juice, cinnamon,mint, and so on.

Mr. Klinetob, aged 86, has been seriouslydepressed since the death of his wife of 52 years,6 months ago. Although he suffers from degener - ative joint disease and has talked for years about having \"just a touch of arthritis,\" this never kepthim from being up and about. Recently, however,he spends all day sitting in a chair and seems tohave no desire to engage in self-care activities.He tells the visiting nurse that he doesn' t get washed up anymore because he' s \"too stiff\" in the morning to bathe and \"I just don' t seem to have the energy .\" The visiting nurse notices that his hair is matted and uncombed, his face has traces of previous meals, and he has a strong body odor . His adult children have complained that their normally fastidious father seems not to care about personal hygiene any longer. Nursing Diagnosis: Bathing/Hygiene Self- Care Decit, related to decreased strength andendurance, discomfort, and depression, as evidence by matted and uncombed hair, newbeard, food particles on face, and strong bodyodor b.Miss Adams sustained a right-sided cerebralinfarct that resulted in left hemiparesis (paralysis on left side of body) and left \"neglect.\" She ignores the left side of her body and actually denies its existence. When asked about her left leg, she stated that it belonged to the woman in the next bed \u2014this while she was in a private room. This patient was previously quite active: she walked for 45 to 60 minutes four or ve times a week and was an avid swimmer . At pres- ent, she cannot move either her left arm or leg . Nursing Diagnosis: Body Image Disturbance, related to left hemiparesis (paralysis), as evidencedby her ignoring the left side of her body follow-ing her inability to move it c.After trying to conceive a child for 11 years, Tedand Rosemary Hines sought the assistance of afertility specialist who was highly recommendedby a friend. It was determined that Ted's spermwas inadequate, and Rosemary was inseminatedwith sperm from an anonymous donor. The cou-ple was told that the donor was healthy and thathe was selected because he resembled Ted. Rose-mary became pregnant after the second in-vitrofertilization attempt and delivered a healthybaby girl named Sarah. Sarah is now 7 years old, and Ted and Rosemary have learned from blood tests that their fertilityspecialist is the biologic father of their child. Itseems that he lied to some couples about usingsperm from anonymous donors and deceivedothers into thinking the wives had becomepregnant when he had simply injected themwith hormones. Ted and Rosemary have joined other couples in pressing charges against thisphysician. Rosemary tells the nurse in her pediatrician's ofce that she is concerned abouthow all this is affecting her family. \"T ed and I both love Sarah and would do nothing to hurt her, but I'm so angry about this whole situation that I'm afraid I may be taking it out on her,\"she says. Questioning reveals that Rosemary has found herself yelling at Sarah for minor disobedi - ences and spanking her , something she rarely did before . Both Ted and Rosemary had commented before about Sarah's striking physical resemblanceto the fertility specialist but attributed this tocoincidence. Rosemary says, \"Whenever I see her now I can' t help but see Dr . Clowser and ever y- thing inside me clenches up and I want to scream.\" Both Ted and Rosemary express great remorse that Sarah, who is innocent, is bearing thebrunt of something that is in no way her fault. Nursing Diagnosis: Parental Role Conflict related to unexpected discovery about theirdaughter's biologic father, as evidenced byparental concern about increased incidence ofparental yelling and spanking and the anger the child evokes in her parents because of herphysical resemblance to the fertility specialistwho deceived them.

Study Guide for Fundamentals of Nursing: The Art and Science of Nursing Care, 7th Edition.ANSWER KEY 351 Documentation Method Description/Advantages/Disadvantages SOURCE-ORIENTED RECORD Each healthcare group keeps data on its own separate form. Notations are entered chronologically, with most recent entry being nearest the front of the record. Advantages: Each discipline can easily nd and chart pertinent data. Disadvantages: Data are fragmented, making it difcult to track problems chronologically with input from different groups of professionals. PROBLEM-ORIENTED MEDICAL Organized around a patient's problems; contributes collaboratively to plan RECORDS of care. SOAP is used to organize data entries in the progress notes. Advantages: Entire healthcare team works together in identifying a master list of patient problems and contributes collaboratively to plan of care.Disadvantages: Some nurses believe that SOAP method focuses too narrowly on problems and advocates a return to the traditional narrative format. PIE\u2014PROBLEM, INTERVENTION, Unique in that it does not develop a plan of care; the plan of care is incorporated EVALUATION into the progress notes in which problems are identied by a number. A complete assessment is performed and documented at the beginning of each shift. Advantages: It promotes continuity of care and saves time since there is no separate plan of care.Disadvantages: Nurses need to read all the nursing notes to determine problems and planned interventions before initiating care. FOCUS CHARTING Its purpose is to bring the focus of care back to the patient and the patient's concerns. A focus column is used that incorporates many aspects of a patient andpatient care. The focus may be a patient strength, problem, or need. Advantages: Holistic emphasis on the patient and patient's priorities; ease of charting.Disadvantages: Some nurses report that DAR categories (Data, Action, Response), are articial and not helpful when documenting care. CHARTING BY EXCEPTION Shorthand documentation method that makes use of well-dened standards of practice; only signicant ndings or \"exceptions\" to these standards aredocumented in the narrative notes. Advantages: Decreased charting time, greater emphasis on signicant data, easy retrieval of signicant data, timely bedside charting, standardized assessment, greater communication, better tracking of important responses and lower costs. Disadvantages: None noted. CASE MANAGEMENT MODEL Interdisciplinary documentation tools clearly identify those outcomes that selectgroups of patients are expected to achieve on each day of care. Collaborativepathway is part of a computerized system that integrates the collaborative pathwayand documentation flowsheets designed to match each day's expected outcomes. Advantages: Reduced charting time by 40% and increased staff satisfaction with the amount of paperwork from 0-85%. Disadvantages: Works best for \"typical\" patients with few individualized needs. VARIANCE CHARTING Variances from the plan are documented; for example, when a patient fails to meet an expected outcome or a planned intervention is not implemented in thecase management model. Advantages: Decreased charting time; only variances are charted. Disadvantages: Loss of individualized care. COMPUTERIZED RECORDS Comprehensive computer systems have revolutionized nursing documentation inthe patient record. Advantages: The nurse can call up the admission assessment tool and key in the patient data, develop the plan of care using computerized care plans, add new data to the patient data base, receive a work list showing treatments, proceduresand medications, and document care immediately. Disadvantages: Policies should specify what type of patient information can be retrieved, by whom, and for what purpose (privacy).6.See table below.

Written words, patient records, spokenwords, and observational skills are employed. b.Diagnosing: Once a nurse formulates a diagno-sis, it must be communicated through the spo-ken and written word to other nurses as well asto the patient. c.Planning: The patient, nurse, and other health-care team members must communicate witheach other as patient goals and outcomes aredeveloped and interventions selected. d.Implementing: Verbal and nonverbal commu-nication allows nurses to enhance basic caregiv-ing measures and to teach, counsel, andsupport patients and their families.e.Evaluating: Nurses often rely on the verbal andnonverbal clues they receive from their patientsto determine whether patient objectives orgoals have been achieved. f.Documenting: The documentation of data pro-motes the continuity of care given by nursesand other healthcare providers. 5. a. Having specic objectives: Having a purposefor an interaction guides the nurse towardachieving a meaningful encounter with thepatient. b.Providing a comfortable environment: A com-fortable environment in which the patient andnurse are at ease helps to promote meaningfulinteractions. Relationships are enhanced whenthe atmosphere is relaxed and unhurried. c.Providing privacy: Every effort should be madeto provide privacy during nurse-patient conver-sations. d.Maintaining condentiality: The patient shouldknow his/her right to specify who may haveaccess to clinical or personal information. e.Maintaining patient focus: Communication inthe nurse-patient relationship should focus onthe patient and the patient's needs, not on thenurse or an activity in which the nurse isengaged. f.Using nursing observations: Observation isespecially valuable in validating informationand helping the nurse become aware of thepatient's nonverbal communication. It alsodemonstrates the nurse's caring and patient. g.Using optimal pacing: The nurse must considerthe pace of any conversation or encounter witha patient and let the patient set the pace. h.Providing personal space: Nurses must try todetermine each patient's perception of personalspace; invasion of this zone can evoke uncom-fortable feelings. i.Developing therapeutic communication skills:Nurses must train and practice using therapeuticskills by controlling the tone of their voices,being knowledgeable about the topic, beingflexible, being clear and concise, avoiding wordsthat may be interpreted differently, being truth-ful and open minded, and taking advantage ofopportunities for communicating. j.Developing listening skills: Nurses should sitwhen communicating with a patient, be alertand relaxed, keep the conversation natural,maintain eye contact if culturally correct, indi-cate they are paying attention, think beforeresponding to the patient, and listen for themes in the patient's comments. k.Using silence as a tool: The nurse can usesilence appropriately by taking the time to waitfor the patient to initiate or continue speaking.Nurses should be aware of the different possiblemeanings of silence (the patient is comfortable Copyright \u00a9 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Hemostasis: Hemostasis occurs immediatelyafter the initial injury. Involved blood vesselsconstrict and blood clotting begins throughplatelet activation and clustering. After only abrief period of constriction, these same bloodvessels dilate and capillary permeabilityincreases, allowing plasma and bloodcomponents to leak out into the area that isinjured, forming a liquid called exudate. b.Inflammatory phase: The inflammatory phasefollows hemostasis and lasts about 4 to 6 days.White blood cells, predominantly leukocytesand macrophages, move to the wound. About24 hours after the injury, macrophages enterthe wound area and remain for an extendedperiod. Macrophages are essential to the heal-ing process. They not only ingest debris, butalso release growth factors that are necessaryfor the growth of epithelial cells and newblood vessels. These growth factors also attractbroblasts that help to ll in the wound,which is necessary for the next stage of heal-ing. Acute inflammation is characterized by pain, heat, redness, and swelling at the site ofthe injury. c.Proliferative phase: Begins about day 2 or 3 upto 2 to 3 weeks. New tissue is built to ll thewound space (action of broblasts). Capillariesgrow across the wound, broblasts form brinthat stretches through the clot, a thin layer ofepithelial cells forms across the wound, andblood flow is reinstituted. Granulation tissueforms the foundation for scar tissue. d.Maturation phase: Begins about 3 weeks afterinjury, up to 6 months if wound is large. Colla-gen is remodeled, new collagen is deposited,and avascular collagen tissue becomes a flat,thin white line. 6.Sample answers:a.The patient will participate in the prescribedtreatment regimen to promote wound healing. b.The patient will remain free of infection at thesite of the pressure ulcer.c.The patient will demonstrate self-care measuresnecessary to prevent the development of a pres-sure ulcer. 7.Sample answers:a.Overall appearance of skin: Are there any areason your body where your skin feels paper thin?How does your skin feel in relation tomoisture\u2014dry, clammy, oily? b.Recent changes in skin condition: Have younoticed any sores anywhere on your body?

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE REFLECTIVE PRACTICE USING CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS Sample Answers 1.What nursing intervention would be appropriate to prevent skin irritation and the development of pres-sure ulcers for Mr. Bentz?The nurse should review the patient chart to deter-mine the cause and extent of previous wounds andinstitute measures to minimize these risks in thefuture. The nurse should be aware that larger thannormal amounts of subcutaneous and tissue fat(which has fewer blood vessels) in people who areobese may slow wound healing because fatty tissueis more difcult to suture, is more prone toinfection, and takes longer to heal. To protect Mr. Bentz, the nurse should implement turning and positioning schedules, as well as theuse of appropriate support surfaces (tissue loadmanagement surfaces) and reposition him at leastevery 2 hours. In the event of a reoccurrence of pressure ulcers, nursing interventions should focus on preventinginfection, promoting wound healing, preventingfurther injury or alteration in skin integrity,promoting physical and emotional comfort, andfacilitating coping. 2.What would be a successful outcome for this patient?Following discharge instructions, Mrs. Bentz willvocalize proper measures to assist her husband withhygiene, diet, positioning, and turning in bed. At fol-low-up appointment, Mr. Bentz will manifest intactskin free of skin irritations, infections, and wounds. 3.What intellectual, technical, interpersonal, and/orethical/legal competencies are most likely to bringabout the desired outcome?Intellectual: knowledge of the phases of woundhealing and factors that affect wound healingTechnical: ability to correctly use the products, pro-tocols, and equipment necessary to prevent andtreat pressure ulcers and other skin alterationsInterpersonal: ability to establish trustingprofessional relationships that enlist patients andtheir caregivers in a plan to prevent or treatpressure ulcers and other skin alterations 4.What resources might be helpful for Mr. Bentz andhis wife?Home healthcare visits, printed and/or AV materialson prevention of pressure ulcers PATIENT CARE STUDY 1.Objective data are underlined; subjective data are inboldface.Mrs. Chijioke, an 88-year-old woman who lived alone for years, was brought to the hospital afterneighbors found her lying at the bottom of her cel-lar steps.

DEVELOPING YOUR Developmental considerations: Infants are born with no urinary control. Most children developurinary control between the ages of 2 and 5 years.LWBK696-Ans_p327-424.qxd 9/4/10 3:09 AM Page 398 Aptara Inc.Physiologic changes that accompany normal aging may affect urination in the older adult. b.Food and fluid: The kidneys should preserve acareful balance of fluid intake and output.Caffeine-containing beverages have a diureticeffect and increase urine production. Alcoholproduces the same effect by inhibiting therelease of antidiuretic hormone. Foods high inwater may increase urine production. High-sodium foods and beverages cause sodium andwater reabsorption and variables: Individuals experiencingstress often voiding smalleramounts of urine at more frequent intervals.Stress can also interfere with the ability to relaxperineal muscles and the external urethralsphincter. d.Activity and muscle tone: Exercise increasesmetabolism and optimal urine production andelimination. With prolonged periods of immobil-ity, decreased bladder and sphincter tone canresult in poor urinary and urinary stasis. e.Pathologic conditions: Certain renal or urologicproblems can affect both the quantity and qual-ity of urine produced. f.Medications: Medications have numerous effectson urine production and elimination.Nephrotoxic drugs are a serious concern. Abuseof analgesics can result in nephrotoxicity.Certain drugs cause urine to change color. 2. a. The child should be able to hold urine for 2hours. b.The child should recognize bladder fullness. c.The child should be able to express the need tovoid and control urination until reaching thetoilet. 3. a. Infants and young children: It is important toassess whether the child has achieved bladdercontrol and whether a toileting schedule hasbeen established for the child. It is alsoimportant to identify the words the child uses toindicate the need to void. b.Older adults: Decreased bladder tone may be aproblem. The nursing history should note howthe person handles these problems and the ade-quacy of the solution. c.Patients with limited or no bladder control orurinary diversions: The procedures andequipment used should be assessed to make surethey follow accepted guidelines and are not pre-disposing the person to infection or other risk. 4. a. Kidneys: The right kidney may at times bepalpated by the nurse by pushing down on thediaphragm as the patient inhales. The left kidneyis palpated similarly. The contour and size of thekidneys are noted, as are any tenderness orlumps. A check for costovertebral tendernessshould be performed.b.Bladder: The bladder cannot be assessed by thenurse when it is empty. When it is distended, thenurse observes the lower abdominal wall, notingany swelling, and palpates the area for tenderness,noting the smoothness and roundness of thebladder. c.Urethral orice: This is inspected for any signs ofinflammation or discharge. Foul odors should benoted. d.Skin integrity and hydration: The skin should becarefully assessed for color, texture, turgor, andthe excretion of wastes. The integrity of the skinin the perineal area should also be assessed. e.Urine: Each time a patient's urine is handled, itshould be assessed for color, odor, clarity, andthe presence of sediment. Abnormalities shouldbe noted. 5.Urine is placed in a cylindrical container, and theurinometer is inserted in a circular motion withouttouching the bottom or side of the container. Thereading should be made at eye level at the bottomof the meniscus formed by the urine. The density of the urine supports the urinometer. If urine isconcentrated, the urinometer will be buoyed high;if urine is dilute, the urinometer will be supportedlow in the urine. 6.Sample answers:a.The patient will produce urine output aboutequal to fluid intake. b.The patient will maintain fluid and electrolytebalance. c.The patient will report ease of voiding. d.The patient will maintain skin integrity. 7. a. Schedule: Some patients report voiding ondemand in no apparent pattern; others haveinflexible patterns that have developed over theyears and become anxious if these are interrupted. b.Privacy: Many adults and children cannot void inthe presence of another person; privacy shouldbe offered in the healthcare and home setting. c.Position: Helping patients assume normal void-ing positions may be all that is necessary toresolve an inability to void. d.Hygiene: Patients conned to bed will nd it dif-cult to perform their usual genital hygiene. Thenurse should place these patients on a bedpanand pour warm soapy water over the perinealarea, followed by clear water. 8.Sample answers:a.To relieve urinary retention b.To obtain a sterile specimen from a woman c.To empty the bladder before, during, and aftersurgery 9.Sample answers:a.The patient will explain the cause for the urinarydiversion and the rationale for treatment. b.The patient will demonstrate self-care behaviorsand manage the diversion effectively.

Thechest wall is so thin that the ribs, sternum, andxiphoid process are easily identied. b.Preschool and school-aged child: Some subcuta-neous fat is deposited on the chest wall, solandmarks are less prominent than in an infant;preschool child's eustachian tubes, bronchi,and bronchioles are elongated and in an infant, so the number of routinecolds and infections decreases until the childenters school. c.Older adult: Bony landmarks are more senile emphysema may be present; powerof respiratory and abdominal muscles is reduced. 7. a. Thoracic excursion: This is measured by placingone's hands on the patient's posterior thorax atthe level of the 10th rib, with both thumbsalmost touching the vertebrae. While patienttakes a few deep breaths, the nurse's thumbsshould move 5 to 8 cm symmetrically at maxi-mal inspiration. b.Tactile fremitus: The nurse should place thepalm's surface on each side of the patient'schest wall, avoiding bony areas; the nurseshould detect equal vibrations as the patientsays a multisyllable word. 8.Before: Collect baseline data; instruct patient to remain still. During: Observe patient for reactions; report any deviation from normal color, pulse, and respira-tory rates to physician.After: Observe patient for changes in respirations; chest x-ray. 9.The inhalation of cigarette smoke increases airwayresistance, reduces ciliary action, increases mucusproduction, causes thickening of the alveolar-cap-illary membrane, and causes bronchial walls tothicken and lose their elasticity. 10. a. Deep breathing: The nurse instructs the patientto make each breath deep enough to move thebottom ribs. The patient should start slowly,inspiring deeply through the nose and expiringslowly through the mouth. b.Incentive spirometry: The patient takes a deepbreath and observes the results of his/her effortsas they register on the spirometer as the patientsustains maximal inspiration. c.Abdominal breathing: The patient places onehand on the stomach and the other on themiddle of the chest. He/she then breathesslowly in through the nose, letting theabdomen protrude, then out through pursedlips while contracting the abdominal muscles.One hand should be pressing inward andupward on the abdomen.

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE REFLECTIVE PRACTICE USING CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS 1.What interventions might the nurse employ to try to resolve Mr. Santorini's self-image disturbance?The nurse would need to assess self-expectations, and self-evaluation foreach component of self-concept to determine if hewill still be able to fulll his role expectation to func-tion as a complete, intact man. The nurse shouldkeep in mind that major stressors place anyone atrelative risk for maladaptive responses, such as with-drawal, isolation, depression, extreme anxiety, sub-stance abuse, or exacerbation of physical illness.How Mr. Santorini perceives the amputation andhis ability to mobilize personal strengths and otherresources are determined largely by his self-concept,which, in turn, is influenced by the response hechooses.

Julie is attractive, but at 5 foot 3 and 150 pounds, she is over weight . Julie is initially reluctant to talk, but she breaks down at one pointand condes that for the rst time in her life shefeels \"absolutely awful\" about herself. \"I've always concentrated on getting good grades andachieved this easily. But now, this doesn't seemso important. I don't have any friends. All I hear the girls talking about is boys, and I was never even asked out by a boy , which I guess isn't surprising. Look at me.\" After a few questions, it becomes clearthat Julie has new expectations for herself based onwhat she observes in her peers, and she nds herselffalling far short of her new, ideal self. Julie admitsthat in the past, once she set a goal for herself,she was always able to achieve it because she isstrongly self-motivated . Although she has withdrawn from her parents and teachers, sheadmits that she does know adults she can trust whohave been a big support to her in the past.

Although both LeRoyand Michael \"did the bathhouse scene\" in the early1980s and had multiple unprotected sexual encoun-ters, they have been in a monogamous relationshipfor the past 14 years. Michael has been in and outof the hospital during the past 3 years and is nowdying of end-stage AIDS at home. He is enrolled ina hospice program. LeRoy has been very supportiveof Michael throughout the different phases of his ill-ness but at present seems to be \"losing it.\" Michael noticed that LeRoy is sleeping at odd times and seems to be losing weight . He suspects that LeRoy may be drinking more than usual and usingrecreational drugs. He also says that he is \"acting strangely;\" he seems emotionally withdrawn andunusually uncommunicative. \"I don't think he'sable to deal with the fact that I am dying,\"Michael tells you. \"He won't let me talk about it atall.\" The hospice nurse notes that LeRoy is now rarely home when he comes to visit .
