STUDENT SUCCESS a. Implement policies established by the institution's management board to achieve cohort graduation rate and graduation productivity goals that are consistent with institutional peers. LSU Health Sciences Cente r at New Orleans (LSUHSC -NO) utilizes the LSU System Performance Metrics Process (implemented in Jan uary 2010) , which provide s campus leadership and the Board of S upervisors a mechanism for evaluating annual institutional performance. Metrics data allow institutions to discuss descriptive metrics and performance measures within the context of their missi on, including, amongst others, measures related to retention, graduation, licensure, and pass rates, degrees, and credentialing. These metrics are collected and reported on an annual basis, and they represent a significant analysis and measuring tool for t he Louisiana State University System and its institutions. a.i. 1st to 2nd Year Retention R ate: LSUHSC -NO School Baseline (2008 -09) 2009 -10 2010 -11 2011 -12 2012 -13 2013 -14 School of Allied Health Professions 97% 95% Act Years 4 -6, School of Dentistry metrics will be assessed using combined program benchmarks . a.iv. Same I nstitution Graduation Rate: LSUHSC -NO School Baseline (2008 -09) 2009 -10 2010 -11 2011 -12 2012 -13 2013 -14 School of Allied Health Professions 93% 92% (35/41 ) * Due to small class sizes and various acceptable lengths of study, graduation rates for the School s of Graduate Studies and Nursing cannot be calculated. During the 201 3-2014 academic year, nearly all Schools met or exceeded performance benchmarks . The School of Graduate Studies saw a sharp percentage decline in 1st to 2nd year retention in Year 5 (due to small cohort numbers \u20143 students withdrew for personal/academic reasons, and 1 transferred with his mentor to a university out of state ); however, using the alternative scoring method (most recent two - year average compared with prior three -year average) the School passes with a rate of 83.24% for the LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER \u2014NEW ORLEANS: 201 5 GRAD ACT ANNUAL REPORT 2 most recent two years, compared with 83.03% for the prior three -year period . The School of Medicine experienced a small decline in on -time graduation in Year 5 due to students who were delayed due to Step exam retakes or other scheduling delays related to academic issues. a.x. Median Professional School Entrance Exam : Each school within LSUHSC -NO establi shes its own requirements for professional school entrance exams. All applicants to the School of Dentistry must take the Dental Admissions Test (DAT) sponsored by the American Dental Association, with a minimum acceptable score of 16. Applicants to the Sc hool of Nursing's BSN program are required to take the HESI Admissions Assessment Exam A from Evolve Testing & Remediation; a minimum score is not published. The School of Public Health utilizes the GRE, which changed its format and scoring in the spring o f 2011; the School currently accepts students based on ranking, not raw scores . LSUHSC -NO School Baseline (2008 -2009) 2009 -2010 2010 -2011 2011 -2012 2012 -2013 2013 -2014 School of Dentistry \u2014Dentistry 18.9 18.9 18.9 18.9 18 18 School of Nursing * 80.25 80.25 297 305 303 * SoN Baseline & Year 1 scores reflect the TEAS entrance exam ; the entrance exam changed in Fall 2010 to HESI A2 . ** NOTE: ETS changed its GRE scoring scale from 160 0 maximum in the old test to 346 maximum in new test . b. Increase the percentage of program completers at all levels each year. Percent change in completers by award level, from baseline year LSUHSC -NO School 2008 -2009 2009 -2010 2010 -2011 2011 -2012 2012 -2013 2013 -2014 School of Allied Health Professions * BACHELOR'S MASTER'S PROFESSIONAL Baseline: 30 Baseline: (40) (48) (67) (47) of \u2014Dentistry Baseline: +2% (60) -10% (53) -2% (58) (43) -2% (40) -2% (38) of ) (8) of Graduate Studies ** MASTER'S DOCTORAL 2 Baseline: 31 (4) -32% (21) +50% (3) -61% (12) School of Medicine PROFESSIONAL Baseline: 187 +2% (190) -2% (184) -4% (179) +1% -100% (0) +49% (263) +71% (87) +450% (11) School of Public Health *** MASTER'S DOCTORAL Baseline: 29 Baseline: 3 -3% (3 5) +/-0% (3) +38% (40) -100% (0) * The School of Allied Health Professions has two Doctoral -level programs, AuD and DPT, which are both listed as Professional degrees within the GRAD Act report . At present, the AuD is listed as a Doctoral program on BoR CRIN reports, while the DPT is listed as a Professional program on CRIN reports. LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER \u2014NEW ORLEANS: 201 5 GRAD ACT ANNUAL REPORT 3 ** In 2011, the Biostatistics and Epidemiology programs (form erly housed in the School of Graduate Studies) were moved to the School of Public Health; additionally, all other existing Graduate School MS programs were terminated by the Board of Regents (and thus MS performance benchmarks were eliminated) . A single MS/ Biomedical Sciences program has since been established in the School of Graduate Studies to fill th is gap. *** Completer data for 2013 -14 was sent to BoR incorrectly. Completer totals should equal 37 Master's and 3 Doctoral for this reporti ng period . An updated completer file will be sent to BoR in May 2015. Though completer numbers have primarily grown over baseline figures, i n the 201 3-2014 academic year the following Schools/Programs fell short of GRAD Act completer goals: Master's compl eters in the School of Professions; Dental Hygiene Bachelor's completers ; Doctoral completers in the School s of Graduate Studies and Public Health ; and Professional completers in the School of Medicine . Though Master's completers in the School of Allied Health Professions are 43% above baseline data (67/47), the overall completer rate falls short of its Year 5 goal (67/75) due to these professional -level students facing unforseen personal, academic, and m edical issues. Graduates of the Dental Hygiene program declined 7% from baseline levels ( 38/41) and fall short of Year 5 goals ( 38/43) ; this can be attributed to the Board of Regents' discontinuation of the Baton Rouge DHY program in 2010, which led to a d ecline in overall program acceptances from 42 to 36 annually. Due to this discontinuation (and the resulting diminished annual cohorts) completer numbers will fall short of goals for Year 6 as well. Doctoral completers in the School of Graduate Studies dec lined 61% from baseline levels ( 12/31 ) and fall short of Year 5 goals ( 12/15 ). Persistent completion rate decreases in the School of Graduate Studies are attributable to budget cuts that have reduced the amount of funding available for student stipend supp ort and tuition waivers; with less support funding, fewer students are able to enroll in Graduate School in the current economy. The School of Public Health likewise fell short of its Doctoral completer target as the School just began admitting Ph.D. candi dates in 2008, thus cohort and completer numbers are growing slowly. The School of Medicine experienced a small decline in completers in 2013 -14 due to students becoming off-track /delayed due to Step exam retakes or other scheduling delays related to acade mic problems. c. Develop partnerships with high schools to prepare students for postsecondary education. N/A d. Increase passage rates on licensure and certification exams and workforce foundational skills. Each LSUHSC -NO School sets its own standards for state and national licensure/certification exams . The School of Allied Health Professions requires passage of national certification exams for state licensure. The School of Dentistry requires all students to challenge the National Board Dental Examination, Part II prior to graduation. A certification/licensure exam does not exist for students in the School of Graduate Studies. The School of Medicine requires passage of the USMLE prior to graduation. Students of the Scho ol of Nursing 's undergraduate program must have graduated prior to sitting for their licensure exams. Certification is not mandatory for graduates of the School of Public Health, as it is not available to non-CEPH -accredited school graduates and is not req uired by U.S. Governmental Agencies. In 2013 -2014 a ll Schools met or exceeded GRAD Act passage rate benchmarks for Year 5 , as outlined on the following pages .

N/A LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER \u2014NEW ORLEANS: 201 5 GRAD ACT ANNUAL REPORT 7 3. WORKFORCE AND ECO NOMIC DEVELOPMENT a. Eliminate academic programs offerings that have low student completion rates as identified by the Board of Regents or are not aligned with current or strategic workforce needs of the state, region, o r both as identified by the Louisiana Workforce Commission and Louisiana Economic Development. LSUHSC -NO's review process for identification of low completer programs is similar in each of its six schools. A curriculum committee monitors content and comple tion rates in each program. The committee, in turn, reports its findings to the Associate Dean of Academic/Student Affairs, who in turn reports findings to the Dean. Any action proposed by the Dean (program initiation, modification, or termination) is brou ght to the School's Administrative Council for discussion. Following action by the Council and the Dean, the recommendation is forwarded to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, who in turn recommends action to the Chancellor. Programs Modified/Elimin ated in the 2013-2014 Academic Year Programs Added/ Modified [ 1] MSD, Master of Science Post -Professional Certificate programs were eliminated in Fall 2014. A Master of Science in Dentistry (MSD) program was established in Spring 2014 , which now captures post -professional dental students. This is in accordance with national trends. Activities Conducted to Identify/ Modify/I nitiate Programs Aligned with Strategic W orkforce Needs , as defined by Regents utilizing Louisiana Workforce Commission and Louisiana Economic Development published forecasts : LSUHSC modifies or initiates new pro grams in response to need and national requirements for accreditation. These efforts help to propel Louisiana's Health Care industry \u2014one of the predominate economic development industries in the state. All new programs require a needs assessment as part of the application process and must be approved by both the LSU Board of Supervisors and Board of Regents. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACS COC ) must also approve all new programs; new and ongoing programs producin g health care providers must be approved by the appropriate accrediting body for that discipline; and these accrediting bodies must also approve changes in class size to ensure that national and regional manpower needs are met. Additionally, the Dean of the School of Allied Health Professions and LSUHSC -NO's Director of External Relations regular ly attend the Louisiana Health W orks Commission m eetings to ensure involvement in and receipt of information relative to workforce issues addressed by the statewi de council. The Medical Education Commission, chaired by LSUHSC -NO's Dr. Perry Rigby and overseen by Chancellor Dr. Larry Hollier, not only provides a comprehensive view of Graduate Medical Education in Louisiana, but also tracks and plans for the interrel ated workload and workforce production needs for health care providers in Louisiana. This group brings together medical education entities including LSU, Tulane, and Ochsner, among others. Fall enrollment (2, 828) for this reporting period was the largest historical enrollment at LSUHSC -NO. All Schools within the HSC -NO demonstrated an increase i n overall enrollment this reporting period , with the exception of the School of Graduate Studies. This decline is due to fewer students enrolling because of persist ent decrease s in funding available for tuition and stipend support .

The exceptions are Dental Hygiene classroom courses (a total of 30 course sections in AY 13-14), which w ere \"beamed\" to DHYI and DHYII students (11 total) in Lafayette, and one elective course in the School of Nursing \u2014NURS 4367 -Ethical and Legal Issues in Nursing (37 students in AY 13-14). Outside of distance learning modules, it should be noted that LSUHSC -NO utilizes multiple avenues of online student assessment. Students in the School of Dentistry are required to have a laptop preloaded with textbooks required for their current year of study. Exams and self -assessment guides are also administered via these laptops. In the School of Medicine, virtually all examinations in the first and second year a re taken on student laptops over a secure network. Further, DXR, a diagnostic reasoning program , is used in the first two years and is available to students over the same network. This program assesses student performance in the evaluation of individual ca se studies. Lastly, technology plays a vital role in LSUHSC's Learning Center, where computer -controlled patient simulators are used to monitor student skills in a simulated clinical setting. Students from virtually all clinical programs are exposed to LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER \u2014NEW ORLEANS: 201 5 GRAD ACT ANNUAL REPORT 9 this technology in an interdisciplinary learning environment. These labs rank among the top three centers nationally in terms of this technology. More information about the Learning Center can be found at: http://www.medschool.LSUHSC.edu/learning_center . c. Increase research productivity especially in key economic development industries and technology transfer at institutions to levels consistent with the institution's peers.

LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER \u2014NEW ORLEANS: 201 5 GRAD ACT ANNUAL REPORT 10 Louisiana's key economic development industries include but are not limited to key industry sectors identified in the Fostering Innovation through Research in Science and Technology in Louisiana (FIRST Louisiana) plan, as well as LED's Blue Ocean targeted industry sectors. One of the primary industry sectors identified in these plans is Health Care, with a focus on specialty research hospital s/medical districts ; obesity/diabetes research and treatment; pharmaceutical manufacturing; digital media/ software development; and health care IT. Health Care is one of Louisiana's primary economic development industries. Virtually all academic programs at LSUHSC -NO are aligned with the production of Health Care providers and researchers. A majority of the research at LSUHSC -NO is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Other sources of r esearch funding include the Department of Defense, Center s for Disease Control and Prevention, National Science Foundation, American Heart Association, and the like. FY14 research expenditures at the HSC -NO were $45,486,000 as measured by NSF's Higher Educ ation Research and Development Survey. These externally funded outlays include salaries for numerous technicians and other employees that have a large multiplying effect in stimulating the local economy. The opening of the new Louisiana Cancer Research Cen ter and eventually the new Academic Medical Center will have positive impacts on clinical research and clinical trials. The number of publications produced by students and faculty is a further measure of research and scholarly productivity. In 2014, there were 898 publications from the HSC. Using the formulation provided by the Board of Regents { [(B + 0.5E)/n] * 100 = percentile rank, where B = number of peers below x, E = number of peers equal to x, and n = number of peers }, LSUHSC - NO currently ranks in t he 21st percentile in its peer group for direct research grants and contracts (recorded). Direct Federal Research Grants and Contracts 1 Louisville $ 38,776,391 2 Arkansas $ 37,167,623 3 Oklahoma $ 36,149,199 4 GRU MC Georgia $ 26,604,681 5 Eastern Virginia $ 25,322,533 6 Tennessee $ 21,968,684 7 Mississippi $ 19,317,062 8 Missouri -Columbia $ 13,749,090 9 Texas A&M $ 12,756,668 10 LSUHSC New Orleans $ 10,784,659 11 West Virginia $ 9,981,267 12 South Carolina $ 8,991,881 LSUHSC -NO's percentile ranking for direct research grants and contracts among its peers has declined. There is a general trend of declining grant support for research both state - and nation - wide . The direct research grant and contract expenditures declined an average of 5 % percent for LSUHSC -NO's 11 peers from 2012 to 2013; during that same period, LSUHSC -New Orleans declined 18% . Contributing factors to this decline i nclude losses of faculty with funded research and the institution's inability to provide competitive recruitment packages to bring in faculty with research grants due to budget reductions .

Prior year data was previously reported incorrect ly due to incomplete files at the time the current director t ransition into this office. The Office of Technology Management at LSUHSC -NO facilitates the institution's research enterprise and brings significant novel intellectual property to the marketplace. Major steps in technology transfer include disclosure of inventions, evaluation, patent prosecution, marketing, and licensing. In addition to the actual technology transfer process, this Office is also charged with negotiating material transfer agreements, confidential disclosure agreements, intellectual propert y language in sponsored research agreements, and inter -institutional agreements. In 2014, adjusted gross licensing income was $97,755 from 10 licenses and options. Academic technology transfer serves to: Facilitate the commercialization of research results for the public good; Reward, retain, and recruit faculty; Induce closer ties to industry; and Generate income and promote economic growth. In fiscal year 2014, the disclosure rate continued its upward trend and set a new record for the most disclosures received by th e LSUHSC -NO campus at 52. Faculty engage ment with the Office of Technology Management likewise continues to grow . Increased m arketing efforts have proven successful, with five license s or options executed during FY14 . Also of note, the Office of Technology Management was able to secure nearly 50% reimbursement of the legal fees it expended this period . LSUHSC -NO further collaborates with two major economic development engines in the city. The first is the New Orleans BioInnovation Center (NOBIC), a technology business incubator that aims to stimulate bioscience entrepreneurship in Greater New Orleans , funded in part by the Louisiana Department of Economic Development . The primary purp ose of this facility is to translate research into therapeutic agents, technology, and devices that can be patented an d foster economic growth. NOBIC opened in May 2011 at 1441 Canal Street, housing 65,000 square feet of wet -lab space, stand -alone offices, and meeting/conference spaces. Biotechnology companies developing from LSUHSC -NO and other area institutions are able to lease lab and office in this facility, which is in close proximity to the HSC's campus. More information about NOBIC can be found at: http://www.neworleansbio.com . LSUHSC -NO's participation in the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium (LCRC) represents a second area of collaborative participation in economic development. The LCRC brings together outstanding basic and clinical researchers to develop a cancer center that features successful prevention and control programs, state -of-the-art basic research and treatment options, and the creation of cancer educational programs for the citizens of Louisiana. The new home and research building o f the LCRC opened in June 2012. More information about the LCRC can be found at: http://www.lcrc.info . LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER \u2014NEW ORLEANS: 201 5 GRAD ACT ANNUAL REPORT 12 d. To the extent that information can be obtained, demonstrate progress in increasing the number of students placed in jobs and in increasing the perfor mance of associate degree recipients who transfer to institutions that offer academic undergraduate degrees at the baccalaureate level or higher. LSUHSC has a very high placement rate of graduates into professional employment and/or post - graduate training. Nearly 100% of graduates from most HSC Schools/programs gain employment or achieve acceptance into post -graduate training programs within 12 months of graduation. Job Placement Rates (w/in 12 months of graduation) 2009 -10 2010 -11 2011 -12 2012 -13 2013 -14 School of Allied Health Professions 95% 94% Training (w/in 12 months of graduation) 2009 -10 2010 -11 2011 -12 2012 -13 2013 -14 School of Allied Health Professions N/A N/A (8/40 ) * Because students from the Schools of Graduate Studies and Medicine move on to post -doctoral placements and residency, respectively, these figures are counted as both job placement and post -graduate training simultaneously. This duplication of tracking is consistent with targets established in GRAD Act Appendix D. In the 201 3-2014 academic year all Schools met or exceeded benchmark goals for job/post -graduate placement , with two exception s (job placement for Dental [DDS] graduates and post -graduate training for School of Public Health graduates) . All (100%) of DDS graduates found jobs or post -graduate train ing following graduation; however, a larger number than usual sought immediate post -graduate professional training as opposed to immediately entering the job market. The School of Public Health fell short of its goal for postgraduate training placement due to students deferring continued studies for personal or financial reasons, or electing to enter the job market instead of seeking further training. LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER \u2014NEW ORLEANS: 201 5 GRAD ACT ANNUAL REPORT 13 4. INSTITUTIONAL EFF ICIENCY AND ACCOUNTA BILITY a. Eliminate remedial education course offerings and deve lopmental study programs unless such courses or programs cannot be offered at a community college in the same geographical area. N/A b. Eliminate associate degree program offerings unless such programs cannot be offered at a community college in the same geographic area or when the Board of Regents has certified educational or workforce needs. N/A\u2014The only associate degree program at LSUHSC -NO is the school's Dental Lab Techn ology program, which is housed in the School of Dentistry and is currently the only facility in the state with the required equipment to maintain such a program . c. Upon entering the initial performance agreement, adhere to a schedule established by the institution's managem ent board to increase nonresident tuition amounts that are not less than the average tuition amount charged to Louisiana residents attending peer institutions in other Southern Regional Education Board states and monitor the impact of such increases on the institution. However, for each public historically black college or university, the nonresident tuition amounts shall not be less than the average tuition amount charged to Louisiana residents attending public historically black colleges and universities in other Southern Regional Education Board states.

Similarly, a tuition increase for Louisiana residents is not anticipated to negatively impact enrollment in the schools of LSUHSC -NO. However, additional revenues that would be realized from such an in -state tuition inc rease are not expected to offset the anticipated budget reduction for Louisiana higher education. Effective with the Fall 2010 semester, the LSU Board of Supervisors passed a resolution authorizing the President (pursuant to LA R.S. 17:3351) to increase t otal non -resident tuition and mandatory fees of each campus by up to 15% of the initial year and by such additional amounts in subsequent years as to assure, within no more than a five -year period, that the total non -resident tuition and mandatory fees are not less than the average total tuition and mandatory fee amount charged to Louisiana residents attending peer institutions (as non -residents) in other Southern Regional Education Board states. Most, but not all, non -resident students at LSUHSC -NO (Graduate Studies, MD -PhD, MS , and PhD in Public Health and a few Advanced Dental Education) receive tuition exemptions, which mitigate the impact of non -resident tuition increases and considerably limit s the net revenue the institution realizes from non -residen t tuition increases . With a relatively small overall enrollment, the resident tuition increases help to mitigate the impact of state general fund reductions \u2014though they do not come close to offsetting cuts. Effective with the fall 2014 semester, LS UHSC -NO increased total non -resident tuition by 15%. Resident tuition was increased by 10% under the GRAD Act for all students and an additional 5% under Act 297 of 2011 for MD and DDS students. It is LSUHSC -NO's intent to increase total non -resident tuiti on (with the exception of M.D. and D.D.S. students) another 15% effective with the fall 2015 semester, in accordance with the board resolution cited above. It is anticipated that the increase needed to bring M.D. and D.D.S. non-resident tuition up to peer levels will be less than 15%. LSUHSC -NO also intends to use its authority under the GRAD Act to increase resident tuition by 10% for all students and another 5% under Act 297 of 2011 for MD and DDS students, effective with the fall 2015 semester. d. Desig nate centers of excellence as defined by the Board of Regents which have received a favorable academic assessment from the Board of Regents and have demonstrated substantial progress toward meeting the following goals: Offering a specialized program that i nvolves partnerships between the institution and business and industry, national laboratories, research centers, and other institutions.

Having a high number of graduates or completers who ente r productive careers or continue their education in advanced degree programs, whether at the same or other institution. Having a high level of research productivity and technology transfer. N/A\u2014The Board of Regents shall continue to develop a policy for this element.
