Petitioner also filed the rejoinder to objection of the respondent which is similar to his petition. A brief resume of objection filed by respondent in court is as under. : \u2014 That on the basis of disobedience, misbehavior, insubordination etc. number of complains with organization of respondent were received against the claimant and behaviour of claimant was watched over the period and his act of insubordination were found detrimental to good working of respondent organization. That no clarification was furnished to various show cause issued. That a domestic enquiry was proposed and initiated against claimant. Accordingly, as many as 7 charges/allegations were framed against the claimant, like threatening superior colleagues, threatening to damage assets of company, absenteeism, creating uncongenial atmosphere and illegal unionism. That N. Kumar, Advocate was appointed as enquiry officer on 7th June, 2008 to enquire the matter thoroughly and transparently and on 27.11.2008 enquiry report was submitted by enquiry officer. That taking objective view of the report of enquiry officer and after due deliberation the claimant/petitioner was terminated on 14th Feb., 2009 and requisite amount by way of final settlement amounting to Rs. 3704/- was released in favour of claimant. Therefore reference is before court is unwarranted and liable to be answered in negative that nothing is outstanding toward the claimant as all dues have been paid by respondent. That prayer be dismissed and reference be answered in negative. Evidence adduced by petitioner is as under : \u2014 Petitioner examined himself and his witness and one Nem Kumar through affidavit.6 The J&K Shamsher Singh petitioner stated that he joined service in respondent company on 12 March, 2006 as fitter and during the course of employment he along with many other workers felt aggrieved by absence of any trade union to espouse the collective grievance of workers as such on 29.07.2007 first meeting of 95 workers was held wherein trade union name Sudhir Gen Set Workers Union was formed and he was elected as president and respondent was intimated. That thereafter respondent started unfair trade practice of curbing any move to recognize any trade union as contrary to its policy it threatened the workers of termination of their job as it appear from the letter of opposite party dated 22nd and 24th Oct., 2007 and the respondent started on official move to deter elected office bearers and started to misuse through the police by filing complaint to police dated 20-11-2007. Nevertheless, the union proceeds to seek its registration and deposited Rs. 500/- registration fee by receipt No. 94/0230 dated 08-12-2007 and opposite party objected and frustrated the same. However, Industrial Estate Workers Union which is registered one organized a delegate session in which he was elected as president to look after the problems of Sudhir Gen Set respondent as it appears from union complaint dated 04-06-2008 addressed to Dy. Labour Commissioner and respondents letter dated 06.06.2008 (reply to Mr. Nirdosh Uppal opposite party specially declared its policy not to entertain any right of workers to voice its grievance by any trade union, and thereafter on 7th June, 2008 issued suspension-cum-show cause-cum intimation of enquiry. The witness further stated that he along with other worker objected the venue of enquiry being Hotel and suggested the venue inside or near the factory but respondent denied as it appear from the letter dated 24-06-2008 also claim the increment for its workers. That on 25th of July, 2009 he received a telephone call from DGM HR. Wherein he said that there will be no further proceedings of enquiry tomorrow because of Jammu Bandh. However later they were informed that enquiry officer held the ex parte proceeding in enquiry in their absence at changed venue Hotel Samrat instead of Hotel Asia. That enquiry officer was biased one in favour of company. That there were sufficient evidence regarding unfair labour practice of deprivation of Trade Unionism but enquiry officer avoided to take into consideration and deliberately avoided to make any observation to this effect.No. 26-5] The J&K Govt. Gazette, 30th Sept., 2020/8th Asv., 1942. 7 --------------------------------------------------------------\u2014\u2014 In cross-examination he deposed that enquiry was conducted against him through enquiry officer who submitted the report. He was permanent employee in company. Before enquiry he was turned out and later on enquiry was conducted. He had not received the salary/wages of that month. Nor any amount was given to him by respondent. During his employment in respondent 's company a union was framed and information was given to respondent and can produce information letter before court. He filed the petition for reinstatement. P. W. Nem Kumar, he deposed that he joined the service in respondent Paint Shop on 02.01.2007. He along with many workers felt aggrieved by absence of any Trade Union to espouse the collective grievance of workers as such on 29.07.2007 a meeting of about 95 workers was held wherein a Trade Union in the name and style of Sudhir Gen Set Workers Union was formed and Mr. Shamsher Singh and Ganesh Kumar were elected as President and General Secretary. Thereafter during course of strengthening the union respondent appointed a DGM HR Shamim Hyder and in last week of January, 2008 he called on assemblage that ( \"I am called Shamim Hyder I shall not allow the formation of any union in this company at any cost \"). That after few days he and other workers noticed introduction of some villains in the name of private contractors who used their authority to distract the workers from the movement for their trade union. That on 29-04-2008 Industrial Estate Workers Union Reg. No. 125 of 13-05-1965 organized delegate session and elected Shamsher Singh and Ganesh Kumar as President and General Secretary to look after day to day problems. The dismissal of Shamsher Singh, Ganesh Kumar, Subash V erma and Vicky Kumar was motivated by animosity and in furtherance of determination and policy declared by DGM (HR) Shamim Hyder. In cross-examination stated that he knows that there were allegations of misconduct against petitioner and enquiry was conducted and after report of enquiry he was terminated. They did not informed the respondent regarding formation of union. Petitioner moved the application for reappointment. He does not know whether petitioner appeared before enquiry officer or not and whether petitioner explained his position before enquiry officer or not.8 The J&K Govt. Gazette, 30th Sept., 2020/8th Asv., 1942. [No. 26-5 --------------------------------------------------------------\u2014 Evidence of respondent is as under : \u2014 Respondent examined Shami Sharma and N. Kumar, Advocate, the enquiry officer. R.W. Shami Sharma deposed that applicant was engaged with respondent as workman and on account of his acts of misconduct, disobedience, insubordination etc. He was proceeded against in departmental enquiry wherein Sh. N. Kumar, Advocate was appointed as enquiry officer vide Communication dated 7th June, 2008. That after calling applicant to participate in proceedings and after affording reasonable opportunity of hearing EO. Submitted report on 27-11-2008 EO found charges proved against applicant and some of the allegation were not proved against petitioner on 14-02-2009 respondent terminated the service of applicant and paid all dues amounting to Rs. 3704 to applicant. That claim raised by applicant is not maintainable nor amount is payable. That it is denied that due to union activities applicant was victimized. That respondent proceeded against applicant in accordance with law. The petitioner first appeared before EO and later on absented himself as such allegation that he was not heard by EO is not true. As such plea of applicant be rejected. In cross-examination stated that whether charge sheet was give to petitioner is not known and as per this letter no room of the hotel was mentioned. He further stated that earlier enquiry was conducted in Hotel Asia and then in Hotel Samrat. He can't say what happened during enquiry proceeding. RW Mr. N. Kumar deposed that respondent management vide communication dated 7th of June, 2008 appointed him as enquiry officer to conduct domestic enquiry into allegation/charges leveled against applicant charge sheet/documents were handed over to him. Notice for appearance in enquiry was served. Workman appeared along with some fellow workmen. AR of management also appeared. After conducting enquiry report was submitted on 27th of Nov., 2008. On the basis of enquiry charges except one were proved against applicant. Applicant initially appeared and later on absented himself. He was provided ample opportunity but applicant failed to avail and later on he proceeded ex parte.No. 26-5] The J&K Govt. Gazette, 30th Sept., 2020/8th Asv., 1942. 9 --------------------------------------------------------------\u2014\u2014 In cross-examination stated that enquiry was earlier held in Hotel Asia and then in Hotel Samrat with regard to a question put by counsel for applicant that charge sheet was given to workman the witness responded that report is self-explanatory. Again with regard to a question by counsel whether charge was in detail he again stated that the report is self- explanatory. With regard to another question that how service of workman was affected, the witness again replied the report is self-explanatory. Through whom the workman was informed the witness stated that he doesn't remember the name. With regard to another question that whether any affidavit from the management was taken on record that workman was informed for 14th Sept., 2008, the witness replied that statement of AR of management in this regard was taken during the course of proceedings. The witness deposed that next date from Hotel Asia to Hotel Samrat was fixed in presence of party. But notice was given to workman. He further deposed in cross-examination that he don 't know how educated the workman was nor is knowing that whether the workman is from proper Jammu or from periphery. It is apt to state here that both the parties argued the matter and also submitted the written arguments, as that of in case Ganesh Kumar V/s. Management Sudhir Gen Set Ltd. The evidence of the petitioner and that of respondent is also similar except the petitioner in the instant petition joined the respondent company in March, 2006 and the amount claimed in the claim petition by the petitioner amounting to Rs. 686787.00 which is less than the amount claimed by petitioner in above stated case i. e. Ganesh Kumar V/s. Sudhir Gen Set as such appreciation of evidence is also the similar that of in the above stated case. I have heard the counsel for parties and have gone through record meticulously. Ld. Counsel for petitioner submitted that petitioner was working in the company of respondent on the post of fitter from March, 2006 till the year 2009 after enquiry report he was terminated in the year 2009 and was getting/drawing Rs. 7100 PM as wages. After dispute reference was sent to this court for adjudication. Counsel for the petitioner further submitted that workers of respondent formed a union under the name and style of Sudhir Gen Set Worker Union in April, 2007 and petitioner was selected as President. That respondent got stayed the registration of10 The J&K Govt. Gazette, 30th Sept., 2020/8th 26-5 --------------------------------------------------------------\u2014 the said union thereafter petitioner joined Industrial Estate Workers Union which was duly registered and the petitioner was again elected as President and information was given to respondant company. Ld. Counsel further stated after the formation of the union respondant company started harassing the office bearers of the union verbally and through notices, but the notices so addressed to petitioner were duly replied from time to time. That petitioner was suspended in 2008 and a purported domestic enquiry was held by respondent by appointing Sh. N. Kumar from Delhi and enquiry report was submitted by enquiry officer on 27-11-2008 and on the basis of that alleged enquiry report petitioner was terminated. Ld. Counsel again submitted that elementary principle of natural justice that no one should be condoned unheard without being given the opportunity to explain the circumstances obtaining against him. Whereas in the present case show cause-cum-notice for intimation of enquiry dated 7th of June, 2008 was sent to petitioner vide registered post wherein he was asked to appear in Hotel Asia on 11th of June, 2008 at 3.00 PM. No room number is mentioned that employee should be issued a charge sheet clearly and precisely setting forth particular of misconduct. But in the present case nothing has been stated regarding incident, time and place. Counsel has further argued that the witness of respondent Shami Sharma stated that no charge sheet was ever served to the petitioner. Ld. Counsel further submitted that no complaint was ever received against petitioner but as soon as worker union of respondent company was formed and petitioner was elected as President. Respondent started harassing the petitioner and false complaint were made out against petitioner. Ld. Counsel further submitted no notice was displayed on the notice board. That enquiry in the present case was earlier held at Hotel Asia and from 20th of June, 2008 proceeding were held at Hotel Samrat and from 19th of July, 2008 due to internal disturbance proceeding could not be conducted on 19th of July, 2008. He received a call from DGM Shamim Hyder that proceeding would not be held on 25-07-2008. Whereas the proceeding was further posted on 15th of September, 2008 and on this date all the witnesses were recorded by enquiry officer. Ld. Counsel argued that witness N. Kumar stated that worker was sent notice through post and informed through representative of management but does not remember the name of representative. No affidavit was taken on record nor was notice pasted onNo. 26-5] The J&K Govt. Gazette, 30th Sept., 2020/8th Asv., 1942. 11 --------------------------------------------------------------\u2014\u2014 notice board. Neither he knows the address nor place of residence of worker. All this reflects that due process has not been followed by enquiry officer. That petitioner was not having knowledge of place and date. That enquiry officer in response to many question stated that report is self-explanatory then what is the fun and purpose of cross-examination. That enquiry officer has never visited the company of respondent. Ld. Counsel further submitted that enquiry officer does not know the address and place of residence and qualification of workman. All this reflects that enquiry has been conducted in mechanical manner without following due process of law and principle of natural justice. That no second notice was served by respondent before terminating the workman. That on these grounds submitted that dismissal be set aside. Petitioner joined and workers trade union on this respondent started harassing him and using unfair labour practice terminated him. On the other hand counsel for respondent submitted petitioner raised an industrial dispute with respondent after a thorough enquiry by N. Kumar, Advocate form Delhi. The charges against the petitioner were threatening superiors, threatening to damage the property of respondent and insubordination. Petitioner caused his appearance before enquiry officer in an adamant attitude. That EO showed all fairness and despite remaining absent he was informed through registered post about next proceedings. That in the light of statement of the witnesses of petitioner the charge stood proved against petitioner. That on the basis of report petitioner was terminated on 14.02.2009. That petitioner and his witness both stated that petitioner was harassed because of trade union activities but no document was placed before enquiry officer or before this court that he was harassed due to formation of trade union. That termination order is based on enquiry report and on objective assessment. Counsel for respondant further submitted that report of EO with stood the test of cross-examination and had to be accepted. It is submitted that petitioner is not entitled to any relief. He further submitted that section 2 of IDA defines the retrenchment as retrenchment means termination of workman by whatsoever, otherwise than as punishment by way of disciplinary action which is not retrenchment that petitioner cannot challenge the report of enquiry officer and is stopped at this stage. Finally prayed that claim petition be dismissed. The following issues were framed by this court : \u2014 1. Whether the termination of the services of petitioner is legally justified ?12 The J&K 2020/8th Asv., 1942. [No. 26-5 --------------------------------------------------------------\u2014 2. If the issue is decided in favour of petitioner what relief he is entitled. The first issue is hereby taken up in order to return its finding on the merits and law. Issue No.1 is as under: \u2014 \"Whether the termination of the services of petitioner is legally justified ? \" Ld. Counsel for petitioner submitted that petitioner was working in the company of respondent as fitter from March, 2006 till 2009 after enquiry report he was terminated. Ld. Counsel submitted that workers of the respondent company formed the union in April, 2007 and petitioner was elected as President of the union in the name and style of Sudhir Gen Set Workers Union which respondent got stayed. Thereafter petitioner joined Industrial Estates Workers Union which was duly registered and petitioner was again elected as President of the union. That after the formation of the union respondent started harassing the petitioner, verbally and through notices which the petitioner replied properly. But the petitioner was suspended and respondent constituted a domestic enquiry. The counsel for petitioner also submitted that after the enquiry report was submitted on 27-11-2008. The petitioner was terminated in the year 2009. Counsel again submitted that principles of natural justice were not observed during the enquiry proceeding and were blatantly violated, as notice was sent to petitioner through post that enquiry is to be conducted in Hotel Asia at 3.00 PM without mentioning the room and without precise charge sheet. That witness of respondent stated that no charge sheet was ever served and no complain was ever received against petitioner. Responding to these arguments Ld. Counsel for respondent submits that charge sheet against the petitioner was framed and N. Kumar Advocate, from Delhi was appointed as enquiry officer, who conducted the enquiry fairly. Petitioner appeared and was having adamant attitude turned absent and despite remaining absent was informed through registered post. In the light of statement of charges were proved against the petitioner and was terminated on 14.02.2009 after receiving enquiry report. From the perusal of statement of petitioner and his witnesses it reflects that he was victimized for joining union. The perusal of the statement ofNo. 26-5] The J&K --------------------------------------------------------------\u2014\u2014 RW Shami Kumar in response to question put by counsel for petitioner, the witness replied that he does not know which charge sheet was served to petitioner. The witness also stated that no room number of Hotel was specified. He further stated that enquiry was earlier conducted in Hotel Asia and thereafter in Hotel Samrat, Jammu. N. Kumar advocate enquiry officer when asked whether charge sheet was given to workman he replied in his statement that every detail of the proceeding is mentioned in his enquiry report which means he stated nothing whether charge sheet was given to petitioner (Workman). Perusal of the enquiry report page 3 last para enquiry officer stated that petitioner have received the charge sheet. But none of the witnesses of respondent have stated that charge sheet has been served by him or his presence. As such it appears that it has not been proved by the respondent that charge sheet was served upon the petitioner. With regard to the argument of petitioner that petitioner along with workers of respondent formed the union under style of Sudhir Gen Set Workers Union in April, 2007 and the petitioner was elected as President of the Union which the respondent got stayed. Thereafter petitioner joined the Industrial Estates Workers Union which was duly registered and petitioner was again elected as President of the union and information was given to Respondent Company. Thereafter respondent started harassing the petitioner through oral and written complaints. Respondent controverted this argument stated that various complaints against petitioner were received regarding misbehaviour, disobedience and insubordination and illegal absenteeism and on this enquiry was initiated and N. Kumar was assigned to conduct the enquiry after enquiry report, petitioner was terminated on 14-02-2009, stated nothing regarding formation of union. Record file at page 49, there is letter of DGM dated nil and does not reflect whom it has been addressed and whether received regarding absenteeism calling explanation within 24 hours. The record reflects that all the complaints were stated after the formation of the union under the name and style Sudhir Gen Set Workers Union in April, 2007 and after the petitioner joined the Industrial Estates Workers Union domestic enquiry was constituted. Perusal of the record of ALC page 51 reflects that letter dated 07-06-2008 written by respondent 's DGM to petitioner reflects that with regard to insubordination, misbehaviour, indiscipline and absenteeism of petitioner domestic enquiry has been14 26-5 --------------------------------------------------------------\u2014 constituted wherein N. Kumar, Advocate has been appointed as enquiry officer. Which has to be conducted in Hotel Asia on 11-06-2008 at 3.00 PM. Again letter dated 18-06-2008 written by DGM Shamim Hyder to petitioner also reflect that respondent was aware of the petitioner 's joining of Industrial Estates Workers Union affiliated with Centre of Indian Trade Union relevant para of the letter is reproduced \u2014 \"We do not recognize/know any union by the name of Industrial Estates Workers Union affiliation with Centre of Indian Trade Unions whose letter head issued by you for writing letter dated 16.06.2008 which was received in our office on 16-06-2008. \" From the perusal of enquiry report in the first para the enquiry officer stated that he was appointed to conduct the enquiry against the petitioner into allegation of charges of misbehavior, disobedience, insubordination, deliberate absenteeism and illegal unionism. Similarly in last para he stated that during enquiry other charges have been confirmed against petitioner Shamshar Singh but as regards the charge relating to spreading objectionable views among co-workers against management and superior and to cause uncongenial atmosphere at work place could not be proved as management could not give any cogent evidence. Record reflects as is stated in the enquiry report para I(a) to (i) that all the complaint have been made after the formation of worker union of Sudhir Gen Set in April, 2007 and joining of Industrial Estate Union. This reflects there was no complaint against the petitioner from joining the service in 2006 to 2007 but when he along with others formed the union Sudhir Gen Set Worker Union and in 2008 after joining of petitioner to Industrial Estates Workers Union, domestic enquiry was started against the petitioner. Section 2(ra) of IDA, 1947 defines unfair labour practice in schedule 5 and some of the relevant unfair labour practice activities are stated as under : \u2014 On the part of employers and trade unions of employers \u2014 1.

State of West Bengal 2010 AIR SC 142 Para (13). \"It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard-audi alteram partem, i. e. hear the other side and it is often considered that it is broad enough to include the rule against bias since a fair hearing must be unbiased hearing. One of the essential ingredients of fair hearing is that a person should be served with a proper notice, i. e. a person has a right to notice. Notice should be clear and precise so as to give the other party adequate information of the case he has to meet and make an effective defence. Denial of notice and opportunity to respond result in making the administrative decision as vitiated. The adequacy of notice is a relative term and must be decided with16 The J&K Govt. Gazette, 30th Sept., 2020/8th Asv., 1942. [No. 26-5 --------------------------------------------------------------\u2014 reference to each case. But generally a notice to be adequate must contain the following, [a] time, place and nature of hearing ; (b) legal authority under which hearing is to be held ; (c) statement of specific charges which a person has to meet. However in the State of Karnataka & Anr. Vs. Mangalore University Non-Teaching Employees Association and or, 2002 3 SCC 302 the requirement of notice will not be insisted upon as a mere technical formality when the party concerned clearly knows the case against him and is not thereby prejudiced in any manner in putting up an effective defence, then violation of the principle of natural justice cannot be insisted upon. In the present case, the materials on record show that the respondent had been furnished with proper notices intimating him the date, time and place of hearing well before time and the respondent has also received notices as indicated from the postal acknowledgements made by him in his own letters addressed to the management. \" In Vinod Pralhadrao Farkade Vs. M/s Ceekay Daikin Limited 2017, 322 Bom (HC) held that enquiry officer instead of proceeding ex parte should have fixed next date if the workman boycotted the enquiry and also held that enquiry officer must act patiently on the principles of natural justice. Again in DEM Engineering Products V/s. Presiding Officer, lndustrlal Tribunal, held that non-granting of an opportunity to the workman by way of second show cause notice for making his comments in violative of principle of natural justice. In Anil Kumar Garg Vs. State of UP through Vibhag, Lucknow 2017 LLR 439 (Allahabad HC). It has been observed that for a valid enquiry, generally the following principles would emerge: \u2014 (1) The enquiries must be conducted bona fide and case must be taken to be that enquiries do not become empty formalities. (2) On receipt of enquiry report before proceeding further, it is incumbent on the part of the disciplinary/punishing authority to supply a copy of the enquiry report.No. 26-5] The J&K Govt. Gazette, 30th Sept., 2020/8th Twari 2017 LLR 113 (SC) it has been held that an enquiry violative of principles of natural justice is liable to be violated. In view of above stated position and keeping in view the statement of petitioner and the arguments of the counsel for petitioner and also the perusal of record and relevant law state above it reflect that petitioner joined the service with respondent in 2006 and till the formation of workers union of Sudhir Gen Set and then joining of Industrial Estates Workers Union in 2008 which is registered one there was no complaint against petitioner till 2007. All the complaints started from 2007 as discussed above. Moreover enquiry officer in his report in last para stated that nothing has been proved against unionism and spreading of objectionable material. But only misconduct and insubordination, absenteeism etc. has been proved. Again there was no complaint till 2007 against the petitioner more so his past record has not been taken into account. It also reflect that earlier enquiry was conducted in Hotel Asia and then in Hotel Samrat of which petitioner stated that he was not having the knowledge of change of venue and date which later on was conducted in ex parte. All this reflect that there is unfair labour practice on the part of respondent. Enquiry Officer during his cross-examination also has not replied and responded to question put by counsel for petitioner rather stated that report is self-explanatory. As in a question whether charge sheet was given to workman he replied the enquiry report is self-explanatory. Again in response to a question in show cause notice for intimation of enquiry given to petitioner does it mention in detail any act, incident regarding insubordination. Enquiry officer replied again that report is self-explanatory. Again responding to a question by counsel for petitioner that how was the service of workman affected. RW Enquiry Officer again replied that report is self-explanatory. Again RW in cross-examination replied to the question put by counsel that whether evidence of respondent was taken on a single day. He again replied that his report is self-explanatory. Keeping all the above stated response of the enquiry officer it appears that he was not in a mode to reply properly as if report submitted by him was so explanatory then what was the fun and function of examining him18 The J&K Govt. Gazette, in cross-examination which is the important and essentlal right of the petitioner. The behaviour of the respondent witness in the court reflects that how much he is aware of the right to cross-examination and if witness is responding in the court like above-mentioned how he would have conducted the domestic enquiry which he stated that independent enquiry has been conducted. The above stated facts and discussion makes it clear that domestic enquiry was not a fair enquiry. Regarding the argument of the counsel for petitioner that no second notice was issued and given to petitioner after enquiry report to explain that why his services may not be terminated. Respondent counsel in this regard submitted nothing except that on enquiry report petitioner was terminated. The perusal of record placed on file with objection of respondent there is letter dated Feb. 19, 2009 addressed to petitioner Shamsher Singh wherein it is stated that \"this is with reference to the termination letter dated 14th of Feb., 2009 based up the domestic enquiry report dated 27.11.2009 we are sending cheque of Rs. 3704/- toward full and final settlement of all your dues. \" In his statement petitioner stated that respondent threatened the workers of termination of their job. That he was later on informed that instead of Hotel Asia next proceeding were held at Hotel Samrat in ex parte. There is nothing on the record which reflects that 2nd notice after enquiry was given to petitioner before termination. In view of the discussion made hereinabove and the law stated. It has been established and proved that domestic enquiry was a empty formality. Petitioner was victimized due to formation of the Sudhir Gen Set Workers Union and joining of Industrial Estates Workers Union. It has also been proved that no charge sheet was served to petitioner. Moreover notice regarding change of venue of enquiry proceeding from Hotel Asia to Hotel Samrat has not been served to petitioner and ex parte proceeding were initiated against the petitioner. Again no show cause notice was issued/ served to petitioner before termination for his comments. As such issue No.1 is decided in favour of petitioner and against the respondent. Once the issue No.1 has been decided in favour of petitioner. Issue No. 2 is taken up to return the finding on the merits and law.No. 26-5] The J&K Govt. Gazette, 30th Sept., 2020/8th Asv., 1942. 19 --------------------------------------------------------------\u2014\u2014 Issued No. 2 : If not, to what relief he is entitled to. Once the issue No. 1 has been decided in favour of petitioner that his termination on basis of enquiry report was not proper. To what relief petitioner is entitled to. Petitioner submitted his claim petition in the shape of money from respondent for illegal termination from the service. The petitioner claimed that he joined the service in Respondent Company in 2006 and he was getting monthly wages as Rs. 2500.00 per month at the time of termination in Feb., 2009. A. Petitioners total claim is stated as under and the wages for the period from July, 2008 to Feb., 2014 \u2014Rs. 413350/- i. Notice pay (one month wages) Rs. 8750.00/- ii. Retrenchment compensation Rs. 30625.00/- (15 days for each year of Service) iii. Gratuity (15 days wages drawn on Rs. 18812.00/- each Y ear of service) iv. Bonus for 2 years Rs. 19000.00/- v. Leave encashment (90 days wages) Rs. 26250.00/- Total Amount Rs. 273437.00/- Grand Total (A+B) Rs. 413350+273437=Rs. 686787.00 (Six Lac eighty six thousand, seven hundred eighty seven only). From the perusal of record it reflects that though it has been proved that petitioner has been terminated from the service illegally. On the other hand he has not proved that during the period of his termination he remained without work. Neither the petitioner nor his witness stated that during termination period he was without work or job. It also reflects from the record that the relation between the petitioner and the respondent is not good and congenial and order of reinstatement again in the company of respondent would not be proper for good atmosphere between them as there is total loss of confidence in the respondent and it would not be20 The J&K Govt. Gazette, 30th Sept., 2020/8th Asv., 26-5 --------------------------------------------------------------\u2014 possible to work for the petitioner as well in the company of respondent. It is also clear from the record that petitioner is contesting the petition since 2009 till today which is long period and service of petitioner with respondent is not denied. In 2016 LLR 899 Hon 'ble Delhi High Court observed in para 11 \u2014 \"Para 11. On a specific query by the Court. whether the reply of the petitioner at page 121 and 122 of the paper book, has been proved before the Industrial Adjudicator, the answer was in the negative. The Learned Counsel would submit, even though, reply was produced before the Industrial Adjudicator, but the same was not exhibited. If that be so, it is as good as, the said document has not proved. Even otherwise, it is to be noted, no such offer was given hy the petitioner during the pendency of the proceedings before the Industrial Adjudicator. Rather, the management witness has deposed that the petitioner does not want to take the respondent back on duty as the respondent was involved the criminal matter pending in Kullu Court, Himachal Pradesh. The reliance placed by the Learned Counsel for the petitioner on the reply dated January 29, 2009 even though not proved, would not help the case of the petitioner that the petitioner had offered the respondent to join back his duties. The factum of the respondent being in the employment of the petitioner, is not denied/disproved. It is also proved that the petitioner could not prove abandonment of duties by the respondent. The Industrial Adjudicator has rightly drawn a presumption that the services of the respondent were illegally terminated. On a finding of loss of confidence in the respondent, the Industrial Adjudicator having awarded an amount of Rs. I lakh to the respondent, it is not a fit case where this Court, in exercise of its power under Article 226 of the Constitution need to be interfere with the impugned Award. \" \"in another case of Delhi Transport Corporation Vs. Krishan Lal Mason 2018 LLR Del HC Hon 'ble Delhi High Court held that termination of service of a workman daily wager who was in continuous service for about 10 years by an oralNo. 26-5] The J&K Govt. Gazette, 30th Sept., 2020/8th Asv., 1942. 21 --------------------------------------------------------------\u2014\u2014 order without making compliance of provision of section 25-F of ID Act, 1947 would attract reinstatement with consequential benefits and full back wages illegal termination of service of a workman who have put unblemished service for 10 years is unfair labour practice and directing the respondent to regularize the service of workman is justified. \" \"Section 25-F of Industrial Dispute Act provides makes it clear that requirement prescribed by it is a condition precedent for the retrenchment of the workman and non-compliance of the said condition renders the impugned retrenchment invalid and inoperative. \" From the discussion and law cited above, I am of the opinion that petitioner deserves to be awarded a lump-sum compensation amount of Rs. 3.50 lac without the reinstatement of service would suffice the ends of justice. As such termination of the petitioner is hereby set aside with a direction to respondent to pay petitioner a total lump-sum compensation amount of Rs 3.50 lacs (Rupees three lacs and fifty thousands) along with an interest @ 7% p. a. from the date of institution till realization of the awarded amount. Accordingly an award is passed in favour of the petitioner and against the respondent Management.
