The Agency's mission is to promote good health, prevent disease s, and protect against health threats , and t he childhood im- munization programme is an important part of preventive health work in Sweden. The Public Health Agency of Sweden is responsible for surveillance of the vac- cination programme , which requires continuous assessment of the attitudes and be- haviours towards vaccination among both the public and health care professionals. The Agency works with dissemination of knowledge about vaccines and vaccine - preventable diseases directed primarily to wards health professionals. The work is done in close collaboration with the National Board of Health and Welfare and the Medical Products Agency as well as with other stakeholders responsible for imple- menting the vaccination programme. As part of efforts to eliminate measles and rubella, the World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe (WHO /Europe) developed the Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP) method to raise awareness and overcome barriers to vaccina- tions in grou ps that are difficult to reach. In 2013, the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (currently called the Public Health Agency of Sweden) carried out a pilot study with the TIP method among three identified groups at risk for outbreaks of measles and rubella: 1) the anthroposophic comm unity in J\u00e4rna located south of Stockholm , 2) the Somali community in Rinkeby and Tensta , northern Stockholm and 3) undocumented mi- grants in Stockholm and Gothenburg. This report presents the results from the three sub -studies and describes experi- ences and lessons learned from the work with the TIP method . The report also sug- gests targeted communication and education interventions that were identified based on the study results and with the aim of increasing vaccination coverage in the studied communiti es. The English version of th is report is mainly intended for n on-governmental organi- sations and public health authorities in Europe who are interested in using TIP. The report was written by Karina Godoy Ramirez, Emma Bystr\u00f6m , and Mona Ali of the Department of Monitoring and Evaluation at the Public Health Agency of Sweden and by Asha Jama and Asli Kulane of the Department of Public Health Sciences at Karolinska Institute.

The method is also designed to identify potential targeted inter- ventions to impr ove vaccination coverage. This report presents the results of stud ies performed using the TIP method focusing on three identified populations with low or suspected low vaccination coverage: the anthroposophic community in J\u00e4rna, southern Stockholm the S omali community in Rinkeby and Tensta, northern Stockholm the undocumented migrant communities in Stockholm and Gothenburg The aim was to better understand the populations , identify barriers and motivating factors for receiving the MMR (measles, mumps an d rubella) vaccination, and to identify targeted interventions in order to limit the spread of measles and rubella in Sweden. Parents who postpone MMR vaccinations in J\u00e4rna do so either because they be- lieve children are too young to be vaccinated at the recommended 18 months or be- cause they believe in prioritiz ing natural immunity . Somali parents who decline MMR vaccination generally have a notion that the MMR vaccine can cause side ef- fects such as autism. The undocumented migrant parents consistently exp ressed that they want to vaccinate their children to keep them healthy , but that l ack of ac- cess to health care is a key barrier. The study showed that there are different needs for targeted communication efforts and interventions in these three hard-to-reach populations. The importance of health care professionals' attitudes towards vaccinations was highlighted in all pop- ulations. Parents from the anthroposophic and Somali communities requested bal- anced information about vaccin es and an objective dialogue with health care pro- fessionals using evidence -based information. The Somali parents do not use the tra- ditional channels offered through the Child Welfar e Centre ( CWC ) and School Healthcare, so innovative methods are needed for dissemination of knowledge, preferably through existing local networks and in the Somali language. Health pro- fessionals also need assistance with targeted information, methods , and support to reach out to this population with information about immunizations . Newly arrived migrants need to be better informed about their legal entitlements to health care and health screening services. The health professionals at the CWC and primary health care services need to receive additional information about the new law on health care f or undocumented persons as well as education, training, and support on how to approach the undocumented migrants in a health care context. 10 As a result of this study, t he Public Health Agency of Sweden proposes several tar- geted communication and education initiatives, including a \"peer -to-peer\" project, in-depth educational interventions in vaccinology for health care professionals , and targeted information about the importance of being vaccinated with MMR before travelling abroad . A common feature of the s tudied populations is the need for in- terventions to strengthen the trust between parents and health care professionals. Additional efforts are needed in the anthroposophic and Somali communities to ad- dress the hesitancy against the MMR vaccine by providing objective and evidence - based targeted information. Targeted initiatives spanning diverse areas require the participation and involve- ment of a variety of stakeholders. Efforts should be performed in close collabora- tion between the Public Health Agency of Sweden and the Department of Com- municable Disease Control and Prevention and Child Health services at the County Councils as well as non -governmental and community organizations. 11 Background Introduction The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that approximately 145 700 people died from measles in 2013 - mostly children under the age of 5 (1). The WHO estimates that each year approximately 110,000 children are born with con- genital rubella syndrome (CRS) (2). There are effective vaccin es and thus the con- ditions exist to eradicate the diseas es through vaccination. Vaccination against measles is us ed throughout the world and as a result the child mortality has dramat- ically reduced . Nevertheless , vaccination programmes are still far from reach ing all children. In WHO's European region, there were an estimated 5 million children in the age group of 2 -12 years who were not immunized against measles and rubella in the period 2000 commi tted to eliminat ing measles and rubella in Europe by 2015. Intensive work is currently going on in Member States to achieve this, but Europe is still far from the goal, and close to 100,000 cases of measles (4) and over 80,000 cases of rubella (5) have been reported in EU countries in the last four years. Sweden supports the WHO 's efforts to stop the circulation of these two diseases. A Scandinavian verification committee has been establi shed, and The National Board of Health and Welfare has developed a national action plan (6) to prevent the spread of measles and rubella. As a supportive effort for the health care system, The National Board of Health and Welfare has also developed a strategy for com- munication about the national immunization programme (7), which includes, among other things, targeted interventions to hard -to-reach groups. Diseases and MMR vaccine in Sweden Measles - risk for complications Measles (morbilli) is a highly contagious viral disease that can cause serious com- plications. In a non -vaccinated populati on, it is estimated that about 90 per cent be- come infected before the age of 10 years (8) and almost all will have been infected before they reach adulthood (9). The disease is characterised by high fever, con- junctivitis, rhinitis , cough , and rash, and about 15 -20 per cent of those affected suf- fer fro m complications such as otitis , pneumonia , and diarrhoea (10). In more rare cases, measles leads to encephalitis (approximately 1 case per 1,000) and can also cause a fatal form known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (about 1 case per 100,000). In Europe, estimated mortality from measles is 1 case per 1,000 -5,000 who become ill. The deaths occur primarily among children under 5 years and adults over 20 years (11). Sweden introduced universal vaccination again st measles in 1971 , and in 1982 a combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR vaccine) was intro- duced with two doses. This has helped to greatly reduce the incidence of measles in 12 Sweden to the point that, since the late 1980s, there is no lo nger endemic circula- tion of the disease. Despite high vaccination coverage at a national level, there are still local import - related measles outbreaks. During the last 10 years (2004 -2013), a total of 179 cases of measles were reported in Sweden, of which 75 cases (42 per cent ) were ac- quired abroad and 104 cases (58 per cent ) were related to imported cases. Rubella - risk for severe birth defects Rubella is caused by the rubella virus and usually results in a mild illness with fe- ver and rash that primarily affects children. Infection during pregnancy, however, can cause congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) that involves a high risk of severe birth defects such as heart malformation , deafness, blindness, brain damage , and foetal death. In 1974, a universal vaccination against rubella for 12 -year-old girls was intro- duced , and since 1982 both boys and girls have been offered the combin ed MMR vaccine. The last endemic case of CRS due to rubella occurred in Sweden in 1985. Since then, two import -associated cases of CRS have occurred. In 2011, an un-vac- cinated woman \u2014who immigrated to Sweden in her teens \u2014was infected with ru- bella during a trip abroad during her early pregnancy. The second case occurred in 2014 when a woman who had recently immigrated to Sweden gave birth to a child with severe birth defects. In Sweden, 0 -5 cases of rubella were reported annually during the period 1998 - 2007. In 2012, 50 individuals were infected by rubella, which was the highest num- ber since 1989. All cases in the outbreak were linked to J\u00e4rna, an area where many residents follow an anthroposophic lifestyle and where vaccination coverage is low. The MMR vaccine The combin ed MMR vaccine protects up to 98 per cent of those who receive the vaccine against all three diseases (measles, mumps and rubella) with a two dose regimen . The vaccinations are offered to all children at 18 months and again at 6-8 years of age. Sweden has a high vaccination coverage for MMR at more than 95 per cent for both dose 1 and dose 2. Sweden has thus achieved one of the goals of eliminating measles according to WHO 's criteria, and no endemic circulation of measles has been reported since the late 1980s. The population also has a good immunity level according to regular seroimmunity studies that have explore d antibody levels in randomly selected people from a population -based sample . (12, 13). In the late 1990s, the coverage level for the MMR vaccine declined considerably in Sweden ( Figure 1). A major reason for this was an article by Wakefield et al. , pub- lished in 1998 in the medical journal The Lancet, which suggested a link between MMR vaccine and autism (14). The study, however, was withdrawn by the journal 13 in 2010 due to fraud . The causal link between measles vaccination and autism has been rejected in several large epidemiological studies (15-17) as well as in a re- cently published meta -analysis (18), but nevertheless there remains a vaccination scepticism in some groups. The lowest vaccination rate was reported in 2001 when the coverage among two year olds was 88.5 per c ent, but since then the vaccination rates have gradually in- creased to the previously high levels of more than 95 per cent . There are excep- tions, however, and the coverage is still low in some specific areas and specific populations ( Table 1). This is worry ing because it might mean that immunity is low and major outbreaks might occur in the future . It is important to maintain the vac- cination coverage at more than 95 per cent in order to achieve herd immunity against measles in the population, which means that so few individuals are suscep- tible to the disease that it can no longer spread . Even unvaccinated people are then protected. Limited outbreaks have occurred in areas wit h low vaccination coverage after spreading from people infected abroad (so -called import ed cases). T his indicates that the immunization programme either does not reach all individuals or that some individuals choose to not follow the programme. The outbrea ks have, however, been limited, suggest ing that immunity in some of these areas is good, probably due to the fact that many individuals have already had the disease or been vac- cinated according to the programme.

Among them there are factors such as lack of knowledge, poor education, lack of opportunities, marginalisation, past experiences, concerns about vaccine safety is- sues, priorities , culture , lifestyle, and faith. The European Disease Control Authority (ECDC) has define d categories of popu- lations with low vaccination coverage (19): Hard -to-Reach . At the present time there is no universal definition of hard - to- reach populations (19). Hard -to-reach groups, however, have generally been de- fined within the context of the health care system . The term refers to people who do not seek or are not reached by the vaccination services because they have lim- ited or no ac cess to public health care. Hard -to-reach groups include individuals from different minority groups in terms of religion, ethnicity , and origin, and the se can be difficult to reach or unknown to local vaccinators and public health agen- cies. Individuals in these groups are often less integrate d in society , and t he size of the hard-to-reach groups is , therefore , difficult to estimate. Hard -to-Convince . Vaccine -sceptical groups include people who are generally very similar to the general population in terms of socio -economic status, culture, lan- guage , and literacy. Group members also often have the same access to health care and social services as the general population , yet they have a cautious attitude to vaccinations . They might, for various reasons, either wait to vaccinate their chil- dren or refrain from vaccinating their children (19). More recently, the concept has been reformulated from hard -to-reach to under- served or poorly served regarding groups that are hard to reach because of socio - economic factors or marginalisation. Therefore, vaccination programmes need to be viewed in a larger context and need to include aspects of education, transporta- tion, registration, and health care policy for vulnerable groups (20). Reasons for low vaccination coverage Scepticism and critical voices against vaccinations ha ve always existed, but the un- certainty about vaccination and vaccines m ight increase as we see less of the seri- ous and contagious diseases we vaccinate against. Lately there have been several publications that highlight vaccination resistance or scepticism (21, 22), the reasons that parents decline vaccination (23), and the barriers they face in access ing vac- cines (24). Several studies have highlighted the issue of the determinants of individuals ' atti- tudes and final decisions regarding vaccinations (21-25). There are also several models of vaccine acceptance and vaccine hesitancy , most of which focus on par- ents' decision -making processes (23). Common for these models is that attitudes to vaccination are seen as a continuum ranging from an active demand for vaccine s to a complete refraining from all vaccines. 15 During measles outbreaks in Europe, Muscat et al. ha ve identified three main rea- sons f or low vaccination coverage against measles (26): Lack of access to health care. This is one of the main reasons for low vaccina- tion coverage among vulnerable groups. Such groups include individuals be- longing to the populations of Roma, Sinti, Traveller and migrants who have been hit disproportionately hard by measles during outbreaks in several coun- tries in Europe. Unequal access to regular health care has been documented in these groups and m ight partially explain the low vaccination coverage. Vaccinat ion hesitancy . Such an attitude can be based on the group 's religion or way of life. The decision to forgo vaccination can be interpreted as an expres- sion of the group 's own definition of health where individuals assert their right to their own decisions b ased on religious, philosophical , or medical beliefs. Lack of or insufficient information . In these cases, inaccurate or misleading in- formation, fear, distrust, competing priorities , etc. lead to hesitancy and par- ents to postpon ing vaccination or complete refrain ing from vaccination. Within Europe, there is a growing need to address vaccination resistance or scepti- cism combined with a better understanding of areas with low vaccination coverage. This has led to the development of different strategies and tools designed to in- crease vaccine acceptability and to ultimately increas e coverage . One of these tools is the TIP methodology , which is the basis of this report. 16 The current situation Two groups have previously been identified as hard -to-reach based on documented low vaccination coverage of MMR : the anthroposophic community in J\u00e4rna and the Somali community in Rinkeby and Tensta in northern Stockholm. A third group , with suspected low vaccination coverage is migrants who have not receive d compl ementary vaccination in Sweden . Undocumented migrants are an especially vulnerable group among migrants because they have limited access to health care. Statistics for local vaccination coverage in 2012 reveal a low vaccination coverage for MMR in the studied areas ( Table 1). Table 1. Vaccination coverage (%) among 2 year olds , 2012 (children born in 2009) . Child Welfare Centre Number of registered Anthroposophic CWC in J\u00e4rna , closed during fall 2014. Anthroposophic community in J\u00e4rna J\u00e4rna is a suburb in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje municipality in Stockholm County with a population of about 7,000 people and about 140-150 births per year. A portion of the popula- tion follows a so -called anthroposophic lifestyle with particular views r egarding food, health , and education. The lifestyle involves following the philosophies of 17 founder Rudolf Steiner who advocates a holistic view of health (27, 28). It is al- ready known that some people who follow the anthroposophic way of life are hesi- tant towards MMR vaccinations because t hey believe that a measles infection is good for the child 's physical and mental health development. The population, how- ever, is heterogeneous and cannot be judged as a unified group. A report from the ECDC estimated that vaccination coverage for MMR in an throposophic areas in Europe was 0.6 per cent to 65.4 per cent (19). Vaccination coverage for MMR among two -year-old children in J\u00e4rna is lower than in the rest of Sweden and varies from 4.9 per cent at the anthro posophi c CWC to 93.7 per cent at the regular , county -driven CWC . Vaccination data from the Pub- lic Health Agency of Sweden shows that it is not just the MMR vaccine that some parents in J\u00e4rna decline . Other child hood vaccin es have as well lower coverage levels compared to the rest of the country (Table 1). For instance, v accination cov- erage for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (DTP) and polio is 26.8 per cent , which means that only one in four children are fully -protected against polio. Several outbreaks of measles and rubella have occurred in J\u00e4rna and in nearby ar- eas in recent years. In 2012, 23 cases of measles and 50 cases of rubella were re- ported as originating from J\u00e4rna. Somali community in Rinkeby and Tensta Rinkeby and Tensta are districts located in the northwest part of Stockhol m with a high percentage of residents with foreign backgrounds. In 2013, the population in the Rinkeby district was 16,047 people, including 1,638 children under five years (8.9 per cent ), and in Tensta the population was 18, 866 people, including 1,673 children under five years (10.2 per cent ). The population with Somali origin is esti- mated at 30 per cent (29). In Rinkeby and Tensta, there is concern about the MMR vaccination among groups of Somali origin, and a qualitative study conducted in 2007 among Somali women in the area showed that they do not want to vaccinate their children because they believe that the vaccine can cause autism (29). A report from The National Board of Health and Welfare confirmed these results (30). This is due to the study by Wakefield et al. (14), which claimed a link between the measles vaccine and men- tal retardation and autism. This causal relationship has been disproved in several subseque nt studies \u2014and this is included in information distributed to the Somali population in Rinkeby and Tensta \u2014yet there are still some groups hesitant to ac- cept the MMR vaccination. This is reflected in the area having had a low vaccina- tion coverage since the late 1990s ( Figure 2). Many parents choose to postpone the MMR vaccination . Data from child health care in Rinkeby show that 59 per cent of two year olds registered at the CWC were vaccinated while 76 per cent of the or four year olds were vaccinated. I n Tensta 72 per cent of two year olds were vac- cinated and 82 per cent of the four year olds had catched -up vaccination (31). In 2012, the MMR vaccination coverage in Tensta and Rinkeby was around 70 per cent among two year olds (children born in 2009), which is significantly lower than 18 the average in Stockholm County and throughout Sweden ( Table 2). In 2013, nine cases of measles were reported in Stockholm County. Two of the cases were ac- quired in Somalia, of which one child was aged 18 months and had not been vac- cinated before departure (32). However, no outbreak occurred in association with these two cases. In 2013, a large outbreak of polio occurred in Somalia suggesting that the va ccina- tion programme is not functioning optimally (33). During the summer months, many Swedish -Somalis travel to Somalia without adequate protection and thus risk contracting vaccine -preventable diseases. The risk of a local outbreak increases when vaccination coverage has been low for a number of years. Figure 2.

Source : Public Health Agency of Sweden . Migrants Approximately 20 per cent of the population in Sweden has a foreign background, in other words they were either born in a country other than Sweden (15 per cent ) or have two foreign -born parents (5 per cent ). Asylum seekers and other migrants without a residence permit are not inc luded in the population statistics. Migrants are a very heterogeneous group in terms of reasons for and timing of migration, so- cial situations , and countr ies of origin, and they include groups such as asylum seekers, family members of Swedish residents , migrant workers, students, re- searchers , and unaccompanied minors. The migration can vary significantly from year to year. During 2006 -2013, 86,000 to 116,500 people a year received a resi- dence permit in Sweden. In 2013, 54,259 people applied for asylum and t he most common countries of origin were Syria, Somalia, Afghanistan , and Eritrea. 5060708090100 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Sweden SLL Rinkeby Tensta 19 From the individual 's and society 's point of view, it is important to gain knowledge about newly arrived migrants ' vaccination status. Many come from war -torn areas where the vaccination programme s ceased to operate because of conflicts, and this is evident , for example, in the outbreak of polio among children in Somalia in the spring of 2013 and in Syria in the autumn of 2013. Many new arrivals are likely to have good immunity either via a past infection or vaccination, but there is limited access to reliable data. In 2007, the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control carried out a seroimmunity study among foreign -born adolescents aged 14-16 years and compared the results with Swedish -born adolescents (34). The study showed that immunity levels against diseases included in the childhood vac- cination p rogramme were equally as good in both groups. The study, however , was limited and cannot be deemed to be representative of the foreign -born population in Sweden because there was a large number of dropout s and the study focused only on adolescents. Undocu mented migrants in Sweden. Irregular migrants or people staying in Sweden without permission are often re- ferred to as \"undocumented \". A report from the National Board of Health and Wel- fare show ed that individuals in th is group have limited options for care and are syn- onymous with the informal labour market. They live outside of society, often in crowded and unsafe conditions, and until recently they had limited rights to educa- tion and health care (35). The NGO Stockholm City Mission confirm ed the vulner- ability of undocumented children in their recently published report about children and adolescents (36). This population has limited access to education and health care even though they have the right to it by law. In Sweden , undocumented migrants amount to 10,000 to 50,000 individuals, of which approximately 2,000 -3,000 are children. Most undocumented migrants are likely to be asylum seekers who have been refused asylum, including unaccompa- nied minors, which is a growing and vulnerable group. Thus, there is a substantial need for studies on undocumented migrants and their living conditions (37). Health check -up According to the law regarding health care for asylum seekers (2008: 344) , Swe- den's county councils are to offer free health assessment s for those seeking asylum in Sweden . The right to a health check -up also applies to family members of immi- grants where the relative h as had a residence permit in Sweden for a maximum of two years as well as to hidden and undocumented migrants. Health assessments, which are optional for the individual, are primarily geared towards assessing the in- dividual 's state of health, but they are also important for society as a whole from an infection -control perspective. According to guidelines by The Natio nal Board of Health and Welfare , the vaccination status is assessed during the health assessment and a plan for additional vaccinations is draw n up. Children are entitled to free ad- ditional vaccinations , which is not valid for adults, and this is a barrier for this group. 20 The statistics on completed health check -ups indicate that there are flaws in the system. For 2011, the Swedish Association of Municipalities and County Councils reported that only 56 per cent of asylum seekers underwent a health control. In 2012, the health status was assessed for 46 per cent of all newly -arrived asylum seekers , and preliminary figures for 2013 pointed to even lower levels (43 per cent ) (38). One possible explanation for the decline in 2013 m ight be the unusually large influx of asylum seekers from, among other countries, Syria, which caused an overload at the Migration B oard and/or the health clinics that perform health as- sessments. A study by Stockholm County Council in 2008 showed that the corre- sponding figure for asylum -seeking children under the age of 6 was 20%. Right to health care As of July 1, 2013, a new law (201 3: 407) in Sweden was passed that gives all chil- dren under 18 years of age , regardless of legal status, access to health care , includ- ing vaccinations according to the national immunization programme . Even undocu- mented migrants of adult age have been extend ed the right to health care to the same extent that adult asylum seekers previously had. A recently published study shows that the new law with the extended right to health care for undocumented migrants does not work optimally in practice because one in f ive undocumented migrants is still denied subsidised care (39). 21 Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP) The principle of TIP As part of efforts to eliminate measles and rubella, the WHO/Europe has recently developed a method called Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP). The aim is to identify and increase knowledge about groups with low vaccination coverage (40). The TIP method is based on behavioural theories and planning models for health programmes, including social marketing and communicat ions, with focus on be- havioural change. The models have since been adapted to the area of vaccines by the WHO. TIP contains specific analysis tools for the following sub -steps: identify and stratify groups with low vaccination coverage map barriers and mo tivators for vaccination in these groups propose evidence -based interventions based on specific needs The analysis method includes research studies linking traditional public health in- vestigations and target group identification with refined stratification and profiling of the group s. This helps to understand the interests, characteristics , and needs of different population groups and individuals in a society. The TIP guide provides methods and tools that support the work of the national im- munization programme with a goal of design ing targeted strategies that increase compliance with the programme. The methods described in this guide can be ap- plied at any time in the work to maintain high vaccination coverage, but they can be esp ecially valuable when one has identified groups with low vaccination cover- age or at-risk groups with increased susceptibility to vaccine -preventable diseases. TIP: step by step The TIP process consists of several steps, including two main phases ( formativ e and planning), which in t urn are divided into sub -steps. The f ormative phase (Figure 3) aims to identify and analyse the problem via three sub-steps: 1. define the research problem 2. stratify and prioritise target groups 3. analy se behaviour patterns 22 Figure 3. Overview of the formative phase of the TIP. Adapted from the TIP guide (40) Part 1 involves identify ing the research problem and focus ing on research ques- tions by identifying knowledge gaps. Part 2 involves stratifying and prioritising target groups using quantitative data, lit- erature searches , and discussions with key informants . Data are then collected mainly through qualitative studies that are analysed , in this case , with content anal- ysis. The results are then structured using conceptual maps ( Figure 4). A concep- tual map describes the most important determinants at the community, group , or in- dividual level when it comes to decisions about vaccinating or having access to vaccination. A factor that hinders the individual or target group is illustrated by a red bubble , while a promoting or motivating factor is presented as a green bubble (see conceptual maps for each sub -study). In Part 3 , behaviour patterns are analysed based on the conceptual map s, and b arri- ers to vaccination are identified and analysed in detail. Great emphasis is also Profile target groups of un-/un- der-vaccinated Prioritize target groups Understand the situation Infant and child vaccination Analyse risk for vaccine -prevent- able diseases Define the vaccination status of the child Full & timely vac- cinated Partially vaccinated Not vac- cinated Part 1: Define the problem statement - Use available data - Interviews - SWOT -analysis - Identify knowledge gaps - Broad description of the target groups Refine problem statement Analyse vaccination behaviours of caregivers, providers, influ- encers Part 2: Stratify and prioritize target groups - Analys is - Coverage - Demographic data - Conceptual maps Del 3: Behaviour al analysis - Identify barriers and motivators - Differences in behav- iours -assess importance and opportunities for change The formative phase Identify susceptible populations and diagnose barriers to vaccination 23 placed on understanding the reasoning of the sub -groups that do vaccinate their children . In the dynamics of the responses and arguments between those who vac- cinate and those who do not vaccinate, one can discern patterns and better under- stand behaviours. Figure 4.

During this phase, the aim and purpose m ight be modified based on the knowledge gener- ated throughout the project . It is important that these discussions gather a broad and multi disciplinary group that includes people with local knowledge about the target groups as well as the organizations that are responsible for the vaccination cover- age in th e area being studied.

Adapted from the TIP guide (40) Set or modif y purpose and objectives Identify strategies to increase vaccination coverage Part 4 & 5: Define strategic priorities Use strategies for behaviour change Design activites Create indicators to measure change Part 6: Design inter- ventions Promising prac- tices Design activities Budgets Final report Define interventions Monitor and evaluate Planning phase Design evidence -based responses 25 Purpose The overall purpose of this project is to support the elimination of measles and rubella in Europe by increasing vaccination coverage to at least 95 per cent in areas with suboptimal coverage in Sweden. Specific aims Pilot the TIP method in Sweden for increased knowledge about groups with low vaccination coverage and increased risk of outbreaks Map barriers and motivating factors for MMR vaccination in the groups stud- ied Design proposals for possi ble interventions to prevent the spread of diseases in Sweden by developing targeted interventions in groups with low MMR vac- cination coverage The experiences gained from the project will be used for planning both information and educatio n interventions aimed at health care workers and parents as well as other people with influence over the decision to vaccinate. 26 Method The TIP methodolog y has been used throughout this pilot study in Sweden . TIP step 1 - formative phase Part 1: Define the problem statement To define the research statement , a workshop was held with key informants , stake- holders , and the research group (appendix 1). The principle s behind the TIP method w ere presented , and a status report of the situation was developed. Partici- pants a lso performed a preliminary Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats ( SWOT ) analysis of the national immunization programme . An initial anal- ysis of which groups to include in the project as well as an initial progress report about the groups was a n important starting point for the future work and helped to specify the research questions for the qualitative studies. The project has focused on three identified groups at risk for outbreaks of measles and rubella. The groups ha d been identified in adva nce and were described in the current situation section earlier in this report : the anthroposophic community in J\u00e4rna, southern Stockholm the Somali community in Rinkeby and Tensta, northern Stockholm undocumented migrant s in Stockholm and Gothenburg Part 2: Stratify and prioritise target groups The second part of the mapping phase involved three qualitative sub -studies con- sisting of in-depth interviews with parents of preschool children as well as in -depth interviews with child health clinic staff, he alth professionals , and other informants such as interpreters and staff at clinics for undocumented migrants. A qualitative research methodology was used in the study , and the material was analysed with content analysis (table 2). This part also included q uestions about the information and media channels as well as information search patterns within the field of vac- cine preventable diseases and vaccinations . Content analysis is an empirical scientific method that is used to draw conclusions about the conten t of various types of communication such as in -depth interviews (41). Within qualitative research, the latent content of an interview text is analysed meaning that the researcher makes an interpretation of the meaning of the text. The analysis process has a specific approach , and the process is explained in detail in each sub -study, in particular how the ca tegorisation was set out. After the qualitative analysis, the results were structured according to the TIP model and preliminary conceptual maps were produced for each sub -study. 27 Table 2.

In the third part, the qualitative results were analy sed together with the dynamics that are evident in the conceptual maps. Results for the sub -study in J\u00e4rna are described in a recent scientific publica- tion (42), the results for the sub -study in Rinkeby and Tensta are currently being prepared for publication (43), and the results for the undocumented migrants are in- cluded in a master's thesis (44). TIP step 2 - planning phase In step 2 of the TIP model, the planning phase, the entire project team was gathered for a two -day workshop to discuss the results of the formative phase and to identify strategic priorities for designing feasible and relevant interventions . It was particu- larly important that representatives of the Department of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention and the Regional Preventive Child Health Services within the Stockholm County Council participated to identify appropriate interventions with those who carried out the studies at the Public Health Agency of Sweden and the Karolinska Institute. Representatives of the ECDC and WHO Europe also at- tended the workshop . In this interdisciplinary project group, there was broad knowled ge represented by vaccine experts, health communicators, responsible stakeholders on the county councils, and researchers. Potential interventions were identified that were primarily based on the results of the studies, the group 's collec-28 tive knowledge , and the visual instruments that the TIP offers as coloured concep- tual maps. Both the preliminary SWOT analysis and the conceptual maps were up- dated jointly during the workshop. During the spring of 2014, several follow -up meetings were held with smaller pro- ject groups, and through them the interventions were planned in detail. Table s 3A- D describe the proposed goals , the activity plan s, the target groups , and the project managers. Method for planning and evaluati on of interventions The Pu blic Health Agency of Sweden continuously monitor s vaccination coverage , and this allows the effect of potential interventions to be evaluated. Immunization statistics are compiled at a national and local level each year . Additionally, the Public Health Ag ency of Sweden is responsible for the new national vaccination registry that started on January 1, 2013, and allow s for continuous monitoring of vaccination coverage at the local level. Interventions will be planned and evaluated according to the RE-AIM evaluation model (45). RE-AIM includes five aspects ; Reach, Efficacy (effectiveness ), Adop- tion, Implementati on, and Maintenance. Together, these form the overall effect or outcome of a public health intervention . The model is flexible and can be based on different methods, and this allows it to be adapted to the various planned interven- tions that may lead to beh avioural changes of a specific target group. The model can also be used during the planning phase of interventions by the use of a specific toolkit (36). Systematic planning of interventions with the various tools can lead to reliable results (46) as well as to better evaluations (47, 48). Communication interventions for newly arrived and undocumented migrants can be difficult to evaluate due to the difficult ies to estimate the actual size of the target group denominator. The RE-AIM evaluation model will be used for interventions in J\u00e4rna as well as Rinkeby and Tensta and, to the greatest extent possible, to plan and evaluate communication interventions direct ed to undocumented migrants. 29 Result s The results are presented according to the TIP strategy . An analysis of the immun- ization programme is followed by the results of the three sub -studies ( the anthropo- sophic community in J\u00e4rna, the Somali community in Rinkeby and Tensta , and the undocumented migrants in Stockholm and Gothenburg), which is then followed by a presentation of the strategic priorities for designing relevant interventions . Analysis of the national immunization programme The first formativ e step in the TIP project was to analyse the national immuniza- tion programme according to the SWOT approach , which is a well -used tool when developing relevant strategies ( Figure 6). Strengths and weaknesses provide an overview of the internal environment and the current situation, while the opportuni- ties, risks , and threats reflect the external environment and provide a more future - orientated view of the situation. Figure 6. SWOT analys is of the national immunization programme in Sweden Strengths High and stable vaccination coverage for MMR. Well-established vaccination programme , includ- ing CWC services and School Health Care s er- vices. Focus on relation s and trust among parents and health care providers. The website of the Public Health Agency of Swe- den is well used by health care provider s. Weaknesses Distrust of the health care system among some social groups. Lack of knowledge regarding attitudes among child health care providers. Child health care providers are often ov erworked and lack time. Reduced resources for School Health Care Ser- vices. Lack of communication channels about vaccines from reliable sources . Opportunities Government engaged in questions regarding vac- cinations with a new law for the national immun- ization programme in 2012. A new national vaccination registry . A new Public Health Agency of Sweden in 2014 that is responsible for public health. Use of social media/IT, literate population. Parental consent required for vaccination (oral and written) - good opportunity to shar e infor- mation. Threats Increasing vaccine hesitance among certain groups . Outbreaks due to imported cases of measles and rubella . Groups who actively refuse vaccination . Increased segmentation and marginalization of certain groups in society. The Swedish child hood immunization programme is generally a well -functioning programme with many strengths and opportunities. However, there are a couple of weaknesses and risks identified in the SWOT analysis that are interesting to high- light. Among the se is a lack of knowledge when it comes to care providers ' percep- tions and attitudes towards vaccination, and these must be addressed as part of the quality assessment of health care work, particularly in areas with low vaccination coverage. In addition, the CWC staff have a heavy workload with little time left for 30 dialogue with parents . Furthermore, the vaccine hesitance is increasing in certain groups as seen in social media. It is important , therefore, to use a variety of com- munication channels to convey factu al knowledge about vaccines both to the public and to health care professionals. Study among the anthroposophic community in J\u00e4rna Result of the qualitative study and the TIP analysis The result of the study revealed that there were large differences in the interviewed parents ' reasoning about the MMR vaccination and their attitudes towards vaccina- tion in general . Three different parent groups could be distinguished: those who vaccinate on time those who postpone the MMR vaccination a few years those who avoid vaccination in childhood Parents who vaccinate and those who avoid vaccinations for their children have a different approach to health that can be summed up as either an allopathic ap- proach to health or a holistic approach to health. The parent s who vaccinated on time s aw measles as a serious disease and fe lt that they c ould trust CWC staff and vaccine experts. The parents felt safe with the MMR vaccine because it has been used for a long time. Another parent group postponed vaccination for a few years because they felt that their children were too young to be vaccinated with MMR at 18 months ( Figure 7). Parents prefer red natural immunity but d id not refrain entirely from vaccination ; instead, they would rather wait a few years to give the ch ild time to grow, develop , and let the immune system mature prior to vacc ination. While the child is un -vac- cinated, parents are careful not to expose them to anyone with a disease . The par- ents considered themselves to be responsible for both their own and other 's chil- dren in the community , and a ll parents who vaccinated their children before the age of 5 viewed herd immunity as an important concept. Parents who d id not vaccinate their children prioritized natural immunity for chil- dren up until the teen age y ears. When the children bec ame adolescents, however, the parents were planning on vaccinating them when travel ling abroad if the child had not acquired natural immunity via infection ( Figure 7). Concerns about long- term side effects were described as a reason to postpone or avoid vaccination , and parents also expressed distrust and questioned the commercial interests of the phar- maceutical industry and the societal motives for vaccination . They felt that deci- sions are made from an economic point of view . Parents felt they have the knowledge and ability to care for children having measles and consider that this only involve d taking care of the children in a proper way to decrease the risks for compli cations due to measles . They also felt safe with the know ledge and availabil- 31 ity of the anthroposophic health care in J\u00e4rna with its knowledgeable and experi- enced staff. Before taking a final decision on vaccination , they discussed the matter with the anthroposophic care professionals and sought information on th e Internet. Parents from all groups requested more balanced information about vaccinations and an objective dialogue with health care providers using evidence -based infor- mation. Results for the sub-study in J \u00e4rna are described in a recent article in Vaccine (42). Figure 7.

The following suggestions for furthe r work in J\u00e4rna should be carried out in close collaboration between the Public Health Agency of Sweden, Child Health services , and the Department of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention of Stock- holm County Council. For overall and detailed objectives and activity plans, see Tables 3A and 3 B.

In addition, there are two sub-themes: Reasons to vaccinate and Reasons not to vaccinate. The study shows that several factors infl uence parents ' choices about the MMR vaccination ( Figure 8). Newly arrived parents were generally more positive about the MMR vaccina- tion, but when they become well rooted and have established social contacts in the area they wanted to postpone the MMR vaccination until the child had begun to talk. In conclusion, this study in Rinkeby and Tensta suggests that parents who do not vaccinate their children generally believe that the MMR vaccine can cause side ef- fects such as autism. Both parents and CW C staff expressed how non -vaccinating parents tried to influ- ence other parents not to vaccinat e children against measles. Non -vaccinating par- ents spread rumours that the MMR vaccine is associated with autism, and some parents became frightened and refrain ed from vaccination. A new trend that has caught the attention of CWC nurses over the past year is the fear that the MMR vaccine also affects decisions regarding other vaccinations. CWC staff also confirmed that some parents decline vaccination at both one and five years of age due to the fear that it could be the MMR vaccine that was being offered. The population has asked for more information about the pros and cons of vac- cines, but they do not use traditional channels offered through the CWC and S chool Health Care. Many come from a culture where the word -of-mouth tradition is strong and where information and knowledge is passed through personal relation- ships. It is , therefore , difficult for health care staff to communicate knowledge about vaccines. Parents ' confidence in CWC staff was another key factor in choosing vaccination . Parents who trusted the CWC staff were more motivated to vaccinate on time. These p arents also asked for advice about children 's health and development , asked more questions and were more accepting of answers. The attitude of health care staff is also very important for the choice to vaccinate, and the study subjects called for a dialogue with CWC staff. Some of the results of this sub -study will be prese nted in an upcoming scientific publication (43). 34 Figure 8. Conceptual map indicating barriers (red) and motivators (green) for parents in the Somali community in Tensta and Rinkeby who postpone or avoid MMR vaccination for their children. Interventions in Rinkeby and Tensta Future interventions in Rinkeby and Tensta should contain several parallel commu- nication interventions aimed at both parents of young children as well as other community members and health care staff in the area. Interventions should particu- larly focus on the key Swedish -Somali informants in the area since the results of this study show that parents ' socia l networks influence their decision about whether or not to vaccinate their children. The report from The National Board of Health and Welfare in 2009 (30) show ed that the preventive child health services made several interventions in Tensta and Rinkeby during the 2007 -2009 period to answer questions from the public and to provide information about the MMR vaccine. Despite this, the fear of autism re- mains among Swedish -Somalis . This suggests a need for innovative interventions and thinking outside the box when it comes to education and information interven- tions . Peer pressure from others in their social network Peer pressure from rel- atives Friends who vaccinate their children and are positive to MMR Fear of autism Fear for MMR spills over to other vaccines Fear of MMR vaccine side ef- fects Positive attitude to immun- ization in general and to the MMR vaccine Vaccinate because they want to protect their chil- dren Perception of negative atti- tudes from some CWC nurses Vaccines are available and free of charge Recommended MMR immun- ization at 18 months Newcomer to the area of Rinkeby and Tensta Trust in the CWC nurses and have positive encoun- ters Swedish immunization and health system offers good care Residing a long time in the neighborhood Pare nts of So- mali origin in Rinkeby and Tensta who de- lay or avoid vaccination Opportunity Societal level Support Social and group level Personal motivators Individual level 35 Below is a proposal for continued work in Rinkeby and Tensta to be performed in close collaboration between the Public Health Agency of Sweden, Child Health services , health clinic s and School Health services in the area, the Department of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention of Stockholm County Council, Re- gional Preventive Child Health Services, health communicators in counties and municipalities , and Somali NGOs . For overall and detaile d objectives and activity plans, see Tables 3A and 3 C. Interventions to improve competence among health care professionals Strengthened education in vaccinology for increased ability to respond to vac- cine-related questions Educational interventions for local health care staff to facilitate a constructive dialogue with Somali groups regarding vaccination and the non-existent link between the MMR vaccine and autism Increased support for respond ing to vaccine -hesitant Somali parents Health communications interventions targeted at parents Culture and target -group tailored communications Balanced and factual information about MMR vaccinations Conditions to discuss autism within existing networks Information about the non -existent link between the MMR vaccine and autism A contact person \u2014a vaccine expert \u2014who can provide a balanced view and in- formation about vaccinations A \"vaccine champion \" project, i.e. innovative channels to reach key Somali in- formants who c an forward information about vaccinations to Swedish -Somalis in Rinkeby and Tensta An educational project following peer-to-peer methodology (49-51) based on educators from the Somali community . An advantage of the peer -to-peer method is that the local trainer can provide information in the target group 's own language and can consider cultura l aspects. Information about the importance of being vaccinated against MMR before travelling abroad. Other targeted interventions Ensuring that vaccination status is always assessed as part of the medical check -ups of newly -arrived Somalis A targeted seroimmunity study in Rinkeby and Tensta in order to investigate the immunity levels of the population as a whole against measles and rubella. This is to better assess the risk of an outbreak and the need for tailored inter- ventions . 36 Study of undocumented migrants in Stockholm and Gothenburg Result of the qualitative study and the TIP analysis The findings of the qualitative study among undocumented migrants can be sum- marised in two overall themes: parental acceptability of childhood vaccines and parental fear of being questioned . In summary, th is study show ed that undocu- mented migrant parents tend to have a positive attitude toward child hood vaccina- tion and want to vaccinate their children to keep them healthy ( Figure 9). However, there are struct ural obstacles at different levels and a consistent level of fear that re- duce their access to health care and to vaccinations. Undocumented migrant fami- lies move around, often at short notice, which limits access to vaccination services . Despite knowing th at every child is entitled to health services in Sweden, undocu- mented parents expressed mistrust toward the health care providers, thus they avoid ed the health care facilities. Many were afraid that they w ould be deported or be required to show ID or provi de a permanent address when seeking care . The laws are complex and difficult to interpret for both migrants and health care staff since access to health care depends on the individual's legal status and regional regulations . The main challenge that the CWC staff face is strengthen ing parents ' confidence in child health services and motivate them to come for regular follow -ups and vac- cination s. CWC staff also struggle with administrative and financial barriers such as the reimburs ement system that impedes th e nurses ' work and limits the time they can spend with patients. One of the objective s of this project was to find out how undocumented migrant parents gain access to child health care and the health care system (so -called en- try/exit points). The health care sector finds it difficult to deal with people with no Swedish personal ID number or LMA card ( the LMA is the Act on the reception of asylum seekers), and misunderstandings about rights arise when medical staff is not familiar with the law. This result s in families feeling scared and rejected and choos ing to forgo health care. NGOs take on an essential support function for un- documented migrants ' contact with health care , and t he clinics for undocumented migrants (Red Cross, Doctors of the World , and Ros engrenska) mediate and facili- tate contact with health care for both adults and children. In this context, it is im- portant to remember that a person can change legal status several times during the asylum process \u2014from asylum seeker, to \"in hiding \", and back to asylum seeker \u2014 and the rights to health care are different depending on their legal status. Part of the results have been presented in a master 's thesis (44). 37 Figure 9. Conceptual map indicating barriers (red) and motivators (green) for undocu- mented migrant parents who want to vaccinate their children in Stockholm and Gothenburg . Interventions involving undocumented migrants Interventions should include parallel and innovative communications interventions that are targeted to both the different migrant groups as well as health care staff. Special focus should be given to key infor mants and NGOs because the TIP results show that they are important entry points and the y form a link to regular health care for both children and adults who are undocumented migrants. The Public Health Agency of Sweden has prepared guidelines for health care per- sonnel on medical check -ups (52) within the framework of the project \"Structural improvement and coordination regarding health assessments of asylum seekers \". The overall objective of the project was to improve health assessments for asylum seekers. In the guidelines, there are also important themes on the work with mi- grants in a health care context with particular emphasis placed on health assess- ments. The se guidelines can be valuable in future work with newly arrived mi- grants. Individual parental de- cision NGOs important as fa- cilitators for contact with primary care Knowledge of good ef- fect of vaccines CWC not a priority for older children Difficult to focus on the needs of the children Vaccinate to keep children healthy - avoid future need for health care Intention to vaccinate ac- cording to recommenda- tions Law on right to health care unclear Compl imentary vaccination available up to 18 years of age No ID, no address, lack of money Good vaccination services Parental trust in CWC per- sonnel Vaccines are available and free of charge Possibility to choose CWC Undocumented migrant parents who want to vaccinate Distrust the regular health care system Norm to be vaccinated Opportunity Societal level Support Social and group level Personal motivators Individual level 38 Below are suggestions for further work that should be carried out in close collabo- ration between various stakeholders such as the Public Health Agency of Sweden, Child Health services, the Department of Communicable Disease Control and Pre- vention and NGOs activ e in each geographic area and in different fields of exper- tise. The purpose of the interventions is to increase access to compl imentary vac- cinations for vulnerable migrant groups, especially undocumented migrants, asy- lum seekers , and new arrivals. The undo cumented migrants' situation regarding vaccination and health care issues involve structural problems at different levels that need to be addressed by authori- ties at a societal level. This might involve disseminating information about new laws concerning the right to health care for new arrivals and increasing the imple- mentation rate of health assessments. For overall and detailed objectives and activity plans, see Tables 3A and 3 D. Interventions to improve competence among health care professionals Information interventions with the goal that vaccination status against vaccine - preventable diseases is always evaluated as part of the health assessment Educational interventions about compl ementary vaccination for staff who per- form health assessments. Other targeted interventions A seroimmunity study among new arrivals to gain knowledge about the im- munity status against measles, rubella and polio in order to be able to assess the need for special interventions and to gain guidance regarding recommenda- tions for compl imentary vaccinations for children and adults A targeted seroimmunity study in migrant -dense areas with low vaccination coverage Inform ing about the importance of being vaccinated with MMR before travel- ling abroad 39 Discussion The Public Health Agency of Sweden is responsible for surveillance of the national immunization programme , and it works in collaboration with relevant authorities and stakeholders to proactively maintain high vaccination coverage at a national and local le vel. At the national level, in addition to the continuous monitoring of vaccination coverage analysis of the trends and changes in attitudes to vaccinations is needed . There should be a clear objective so that prevent ive interventions meet the needs of those groups who are difficult to reach with information and knowledge . This includes the most vulnerable groups such as children and certain migrant groups, especially undocumented migrants. The results of this project and its sub-studies have provided insi ghts into how par- ents in the studied populations reason when it comes to vaccination issues . In addi- tion, knowledge h as been gained regarding how the work with vaccine -related is- sues among hard -to-reach groups could be conducted . The results reveal that tar- geted interventions such as communications strategies need to be strengthened at the local and individual level in areas with low vaccination coverage and that these interventions should be carried out for an extended period of time . Furthermore , health care staff need relevant and evidence -based informati on about vaccines and the people's attitudes toward them . Issues related to health care providers ' interac- tions with vaccine -hesitant parents also need to be addressed. To our knowledge there are n o scientific evaluations of interventions within the field of vaccination. Thus there are no evidence -based interventions aimed at in- creasing vaccination coverage through behavioural change among hard -to-reach groups. Evaluation of interventions is often c omplex, expensive, and time -consum- ing, and in the face of a lack of scientific evidence, one often has to rely on best practices . However, evaluation s of the interventions are necessary regardless of the strategy used. It would also be beneficial if severa l European countries could cooperate and ex- change knowledge and experience regarding vaccinations in anthroposophic com- munities since several neighbouring countries have similar communities. Several European countries (Germany, Austria, the UK, and the Net herlands) have had out- breaks in anthroposophic communities in recent years (53-56), but interventions have been focused on controlling and limiting outbreaks rather than preventing them. Thus, there is limited infor mation about interventi ons to increase vaccination coverage in anthroposophic communities . In addition, to our knowledge, there are so far no scientific publications on evidence -based interventions for the work with the Somali community or with undocumented migrants in Europe. This project has contributed with new knowledge and interesting findings that are specifically related to the different target ed groups. We have gained a better under- standing of parents ' attitudes to vaccination and barriers in deciding to vaccinate childr en. We have also gained a major insight into care providers ' challenges and 40 the need for additional training and support in their daily work with hard -to-reach groups. The project has provide d a foundation and guidance for the continued work in dis- semina ting knowledge and communicat ing messages and information about vac- cination. This report also includes proposals for targeted interventions for each tar- get group, communication strategies , and materials that will be developed in the fu- ture. The h ealth care field has the responsibility to implement the vaccination pro- gramme and will also take the lead in developing interventions . Interventions will be tested and evaluated so that municipalities and counties will later be able to use them as a complemen t to current work on vaccination coverage. 41 Reflections on the TIP method Our overall experience with the TIP method is that it is a valuable tool for structur- ing the research statement . The method is flexible in terms of data collection , which is done using both qualitative and quantitative methods , as well as so -called grey literature. The grey literature consists of reports, summaries , and research publications that have not been published as peer-reviewed articles or monographs, and thi s literature search also includes such conference papers and reports . One strength of the method is that it allows for an overall perspective o f the research question and for the identification of possible solutions and interventions . Formative studies should be included in the p roject to develop and adapt the TIP method. Also, these studies should be carried out while the project is ongoing in or- der to refine and improve the project activities. Below are some brief comments about our experiences and lessons learned on the impleme ntation of the TIP method. Work process By using the TIP, i t is easier to focus on the content rather than the format of the methodology . There is a structure \u2014a toolkit \u2014that provides support on how to focus on the problem statement through formative research . Technical support from the WHO consultants and possibly from local TIP ex- perts is ver y important to get started and to analyse and structure the data gath- ered at an early stage of the project . Seminars and workshops with interdisciplinary expert ise and key informants are essential. TIP provides a good start for planning and designing targeted evidence -based interventions . Data are collec ted in several different ways with focus on qualitative studies. TIP benefits The systematic approach of th e TIP method and its structured way of present- ing qualitative findings facilitates the understand ing of the problem and possi- ble solutions from different perspectives . One of the cornerstones of the TIP m ethod is stratification of the target group into doers and non-doers. In a vaccine context, doers are the parents who choose to vaccinate, and non-doers are those who do not vaccinate. The types of interventions that are most suitable emerge from the dynamics between the two groups . Our experience is that the TIP method is flexible because all steps do not need be included during the formative phase . TIP can be applied even if the study population does not allow for stratification, as in the case of the undocumented migrants in the pr esent study . 42 TIP disadvantages A general limitation is that the TIP method focus es too much on individual be- haviour al patterns. There are often structural barriers at the societal level that cannot be addressed at the individual level . The implementation part of the TIP method needs to be further developed and supplemented with a toolbox containing suggestions for evidence -based strate- gies for communica ting with and providing information about vaccination s to the specific target groups. It is also necessary to propose models and tools for systematically plan ning and evaluat ion of the targeted interventions . The usefulness of TIP in Sweden TIP has directly contributed to the design of the national action plan to prevent the spread of measles and rubella (6) as well as to a national communication plan for vaccines and the immunization programmes in Sweden (7). TIP was useful for identify ing structural , administrative , and financial obsta- cles outside the influence of health care provider s. Experiences and lessons learned in testing and implementing the TIP method for immunizations will be utilised in other areas of public health. For example, the TIP method has been adapted in order to reach target groups for an antibi- otic programme calle d Tailoring Antimicrobial Resistance Programmes (TAP). The Public Health Agency of Sweden has been assigned to pilot and implement the TAP method in 2014. In summary, the TIP project has contributed to new knowledge and important in- sights regarding vaccin ation among hard-to-reach groups. 43 Activity Plans - The Public Health Agency of Sweden in cooperation with county councils Table 3A.
