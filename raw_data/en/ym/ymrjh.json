See Attachment N for Recommendations for Portable Vaccine Refrige rators and Portable Vaccine Freezers. To ensure that the vaccine \"cold-chain\" is maintained, Contractor will of Work Page 9 of 12 1. Monitor and document vaccine temperat ures as required throughout the day; 2.

Ensure that hand hygiene is being perfo rmed before vaccine preparation, between patients, and any time hands become soiled. If gloves are worn, they should be changed, and hand hygiene should be performed between patients; 8. Ensure that vaccinators are following manu facturer instructions and federal vaccine administration guidance related to dose, site, and route. Resources can be found at these sites: a. Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases; and b. of Work Page 10 of 12 9.
