Normal healthy cells can remove hydrogen peroxide so it does not cause damage. Compromised or unhealthy cells have difficulty removing the hydrogen peroxide, resulting in oxidative damage that will ultimately destroy the cell. This makes intravenous administered vitamin C a unique and targeted treatment. The National Cancer Institute has seen that based on laboratory studies, vitamin C can help slow the growth of cancer cells as well improve quality of life. Both animal and human studies have also shown that IV Vitamin C therapy can help block tumor growth, while improving one's quality of life. "}
