It's a mighty impressive slate of litigation wins you all wracked up over the past two weeks, so let's get straight to them. A team at Latham & Watkins led by partners David Callahan and Bert Reiser gets our first runner-up spot this week for landing a $1.8 billion settlement for electric vehicle battery maker LG Energy Solution in its trade secret showdown with SK Innovation. The settlement comes just two months after the full U.S. International Trade Commission adopted the holdings of an earlier ruling from an administrative law judge who entered a default judgment against SK based on a \"document deletion campaign\" mounted in anticipation of the ITC investigation, a win that also landed the Latham team runner-up honors. The White House issued a statement praising the settlement calling it \"a win for American workers and the American auto industry\" given its impact on the country's ability to ramp up electric vehicle battery production. Hogan Lovells and government relations firm Peck Madigan Jones also played leading roles in securing the settlement for LGES. The Hogan Lovells team was led by senior counsel Ted Essex and partner Joe Raffetto, Ivan Zapien, and Kelly Ann Shaw. A team at Latham gets a shout out for scoring a big win for Starkist at the Ninth Circuit. On April 4, a divided three-judge panel agreed with arguments from Latham and vacated and reversed class certification in three antitrust class actions where Starkist is the last remaining defendant. The panel majority found that the district court abused its discretion by not resolving factual disputes necessary to decide predominance before certifying the classes. The Latham team was led by Greg Garre, Belinda Lee, and Chris Yates and included partners Al Pfeiffer, Niall Lynch, and Ashley Bauer; and associates Meaghan Thomas-Kennedy, Tyler Young, Samir Deger-Sen, Libby Yandell, Corey Attaway, Beth Get - tinger, Keith Williams, Alex Epstein and Shannon Grammel.By Ross Todd April 16, 2021 Reprinted with permission from the AMLA W DAILY featured on April 16, 2021 \u00a9 2021 ALM Media Properties, LLC.
