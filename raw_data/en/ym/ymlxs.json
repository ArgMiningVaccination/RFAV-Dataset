Their use dates back to the ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia, as well as ancient Greece and Egypt. But they have recently seen a resurgence in popularity\u2014and they have made their way into the spa scene, too. Table of contents You may have seen celebrities, from Katy Perry to Gwyneth Paltrow, endorsing the powers of crystals, and you have probably seen a growing number of crystal-infused products, crystal jewelry and even crystal shops. It's not uncommon to see people carrying crystals in their pockets and purses. Some crystal-lovers say the stones have specific energetic and vibrational healing properties. Different stones can serve different purposes, they believe. Some believe crystals can help [shift energy](https://goop.com/wellness/spirituality/the-8-essential-crystals/) or focus energy. Others use crystals for more intangible purposes: as a touchstone, to help remind them to breathe, center, feel grounded or whatever they want to feel at that time. For those people, the touch or presence of crystals is a reminder to shift their energy, a tool to tap into their own strength. Crystals in the Spa As more and more people believe in (or remember) the power and importance of crystals, more spas are weaving the use of crystals into their spa menus. Crystals are a way to elevate a treatment to a new level; add them to a massage or facial, and you add in another layer of experience. Incorporating crystals instantly makes the treatment personalized. Spas do this by using products infused with crystals or using crystal rollers. Jade rollers are popular to use during a facial. Another way to bring crystals into a treatment is to have the client hold onto crystals or place certain crystals on parts of the body. Even just decorating the treatment room with crystals or intentionally placing them underneath the massage table or in specific areas of the room can have an impact, some say. For example, selenite is said to clear and cleanse, which makes it an ideal stone to bring into a refreshing spa treatment room. Other spas are taking it further, with more specific treatments, like the Saxon Spa's crystal therapy. This South African Spa offers south therapy with crystal therapy, designed to re-energize your \"chakra center\" with clear quartz, amethyst, rose quartz and aventurine, whose vibration is said to be enhanced by Tibetan singing bowls. This treatment is supposed to help you relax, reduce stress and stimulate the immune system. Crystal Healing Specific Treatments The Soak Spa and Foot Sanctuary in Fort Collins, Colorado, offers a variety of different crystal-specific treatments, starting with Crystal Reflexology. This hour-long treatment uses crystal \"healing wands\" on the feet, hands and ears. Crystal Reflexology is designed to balance your being. Or ask about Crystal Chakra Balancing, an intuitive-based session that combines crystal therapy and energy healing to heal the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual body. The Soak Spa also offers Integrative Massage and Crystal Healing for an hour or an hour and a half. This brings crystal healing to massage therapy, to balance the chakras, clear blocked energy and more. To do this, the therapist places crystals on the body's different chakra centers. The treatment is personalized, based on what the client needs. The Hotel Corona in the Dolomites offers a full menu of gemstone and crystal treatments, such as the Corona Crystal Massage. It uses the stones' energy and different colors with your chakras while you get a massage, with the purpose of \"activating the energy flow in the body\" and creating a balance between the mind and body. Matching Healing Crystals to Your Needs The Hotel Corona's spa also has special gemstone oils that are heated and then used in combo with actual gemstones during your massage. - For relaxation: blue quartz, magnesites or dumortierite. - For stress reduction: smoky quartz. - To improve your energy flow: sodalite or amber. - For feelings of self-confidence and security: agate, greenstone or ophite. - For regeneration (as well as resilience in stressful situations), there's epidote, ocean chalcedony or ruby zoisite. - To boost feelings of youthfulness: green fluorite. As the Hotel Corona's website says, \"Gemstones were hidden on the inside of the Earth for many thousands of years, and today their healing energy can help us find relaxation and better health.\" In the past, you could find other crystal-centric treatments at the Ritz-Carlton Spa, Las Angeles, which worked with a metaphysical shop to offer limited-time treatments. Clients picked out crystals that were incorporated into a massage, and then they got to take the crystals home with them. Other spas have incorporated crystal healing therapies in manicures and pedicures by infusing pieces of raw rose quartz or other crystals in the foot and hand soak and exfoliating feet with crystal scrubs. In spa shops, look for other ways to bring the healing power of crystals home with you. You might find special water bottles with places to seal crystals, to infuse the water with the crystal's powers. You can also buy crystal face rollers to use on your face at home after you do your skincare routine. Whether or not you believe in the healing powers of crystals, or you just think they're a useful touchstone to help you stay mindful, they can add another layer of fun and intentionality into your [spa getaway](https://vacayou.com/experiences/wellness/spa-vacations) treatments and everyday wellness routine.
