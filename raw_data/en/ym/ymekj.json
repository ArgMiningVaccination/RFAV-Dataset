The objectives of the study, sponsored by [Gustave Roussy](https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en), are to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of the CD40HVac oncogenic HPV vaccine candidate in combination with the Poly-ICLC adjuvant (Hiltonol\u00ae) in patients with head and neck cancer and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose based on the safety profile of the vaccine candidate and its ability to induce immune responses. Several exploratory objectives are also planned to estimate progression-free survival and overall survival. [LinKinVax](https://linkinvax.com/) is developing CD40HVac, a therapeutic vaccine against HPV-associated malignancies, based on a novel technology that directly targets dendritic cells (DCs), which play a crucial role in immunity by stimulating and regulating immune responses.
