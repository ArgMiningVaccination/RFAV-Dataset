[Read article](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/nutrition/healthy-eating/28-days-meal-plan-lean-muscle/) With the right plan and the right discipline, you can get seriously shredded in just 28 days. Talented stars, killer physiques. At age 62, \"Big Bill\" shares his wisdom to dominate one of the ultimate strength marks. Follow these fit women we're crushing on for inspiration, workout ideas, and motivation. What does it really mean to [eat clean](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/muscle-fitness-hers/hers-nutrition/eat-clean-get-lean-meal-plan/)? In a nutshell, clean eating is about following a diet of [wholesome foods](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/nutrition/gain-mass/build-muscle-whole-food-plant-based-diet/) that don't contain a laundry list of ingredients, additives, or preservatives and are, at most, minimally processed. (Note that many foods that do undergo processing, like milk and whole-grain crackers, still contain good-for-you nutrients. The processed foods you should minimize are either those you can easily make on your own, like breadcrumbs, or those refined to the point of losing most of their nutritional value.) Unlike many [fad diets](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/nutrition/lose-fat/9-top-nutrition-myths-debunked/) that restrict whole nutrient groups or manipulate timing and type of foods, a clean-eating plan features food that is good for you while helping you perform at your best. That means having a variety of choices: [whole grains](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/nutrition/healthy-recipes/4-ancient-grains-enhanced-gains/), fruits, vegetables, lean protein, dairy, and [healthy fats](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/nutrition/lose-fat/6-best-fats-losing-fat/). To help you get started, we've created a two-week plan that allows you to mix and match your meals. Choose fresh whenever possible, but if it's not available or too expensive, use canned or frozen foods with minimal added ingredients (read: no extra sugar or other additives). Jump-start your healthy eating habits with this game-changing two-week plan and get ready to start feeling great about how you feel, look, and perform! 1 of 8 2 of 8 3 of 8 4 of 8 5 of 8 6 of 8 7 of 8 8 of 8 "}
