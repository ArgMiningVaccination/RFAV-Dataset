Spirit Day is Thursday, Oct. 17, a day of remembrance and support of bullied LGBT Youth. Spirit Day was created in 2010 by a fellow Canadian as a reaction to the many LGBT bully-related suicides in the media that year. On Spirit Day, purple is worn and displayed in social media to show support of those affected. The OVC's Student Chapter of the Lesbian and Gay Veterinary Medical Association (SCLGVMA) invites members of the OVC community to join in this show of support by wearing purple on Thursday. \"Bullying is a universal issue that affects everyone, at all ages,\" said Andrew McGlinchey OVC 2015. \"By standing with your LGBT friends, family, and colleagues, you're standing for all.\" For more information see "}
