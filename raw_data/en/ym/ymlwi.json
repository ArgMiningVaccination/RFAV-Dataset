But you also know that it's treatable. And beatable. And most importantly, it is preventable. A number of factors determine how healthy we are, and at the same time, can put our health at risk. In particular, cancer patients in the North face many challenges when it comes to their health and cancer care. That's why cancer prevention is so important. Cancer Healthy Eating and Active Living (CANHEAL) was created to help reduce cancer risk in the North. The goal of CANHEAL is to provide patients and their families with useful information to prevent the occurrence and recurrence of cancer.CANHEAL has put together this booklet to offer ways for you to live a healthy lifestyle to prevent cancer from striking again for you and your loved ones.By developing healthy habits where we live, work and play, we have a much better chance of staying healthy and cancer-free. Please read this booklet and try out the suggestions. Then try another. And another. Soon you will be living a healthy lifestyle!2 CanHeal 3the northern way of caring CONGRATULATIONSOn behalf of the BC Cancer Agency, it gives me great pleasure to extend sincere congratulations to the team responsible for the development and implementation of this vitally important resource for Northern British Columbia. The historically lower survival rates for cancer patients in the North have been attributed to a number of factors, including lifestyle, geography, and access when compared with other regions in the province. A partnership between Northern Health and the BC Cancer Agency (BCCA) was forged to address these issues through the opening of the BCCA Centre for the North, enhanced support for Communities Oncology Clinics and innovative collaborative eorts with care providers and populations throughout the region. This manual is illustrative of this partnership and the joint commitment to enhance and promote healthy living for those at risk of cancer.Fiona WalksVice President, Safety, Quality and Supportive Care, BC Cancer Agency Did you know that more than 50% of cancers are preventable? What you eat, whether you smoke, your level of activity, and how you spend time in the sun are all lifestyle choices that can affect your chances of getting cancer\u2014and your chances of preventing it.BC Cancer Agency WELCOME CANHEAL is a collaborative project between Northern Health, the BC Cancer Agency, the Canadian Cancer Society and community stakeholders. It provides information, recommendations and ideas for patients to address risk factors that influence cancer risk including healthy eating, body weight, physical activity, tobacco use, alcohol use and sun safety.CANHEAL can be used by survivors with treatment summaries, tumor specic information and surveillance plans from the BC Cancer Agency. We encourage you to share this resource and its information with those you care about. We also hope you will be an ambassador for creating a healthy environment in your community. It is important to remember that it is easier for us, and those we love, to live a healthy life when our home, work and community environments support health and wellbeing.It is our hope that CANHEAL will help equip you with the knowledge and inspiration to live in a way that makes you feel healthy and strong and in doing so, reduce your risk of cancer and the likelihood of other chronic illnesses.

ESSENTIAL FACTS There is no safe level of secondhand smoke exposure. T obacco shortens your life and makes it less enjoyable. You have a role in a tobacco-free community.6 CanHeal 7the northern way of caringTOBACCO USE IS A COMPLEX ADDICTION. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT TOBACCO SHORTENS YOUR LIFE. IT IS RELATED TO 22 CHRONIC ILLNESSES OR DISEASES, AND SMOKING INCREASES CANCER RISK. If you smoke, you've probably thought about quitting. It can be a challenge to quit and stay smoke-free, but there are resources to help. To learn about your options and tips for quitting, visit www.quitnow.ca. Services include counselling by phone, text or email. For free nicotine patches or gum, call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1, or check with your pharmacist about coverage for medications to help you quit.HOW IS SMOKING RELATED TO CANCER?Smoking can cause cancer and block your body from ghting it. Poisons in cigarette smoke can weaken the body's immune system, making it harder to kill cancer cells. Poisons in tobacco smoke can damage or change a cell's DNA. DNA is the cell's \"instruction manual\" that controls a cell's normal growth and function. When DNA is damaged, a cell can begin growing out of control and create a cancer tumour.DOES QUITTING REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE?Quitting smoking greatly lowers the risks for cancers of the lung, mouth, throat, esophagus and larynx. Within ve years of quitting, your chance of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder is cut in half. Ten years after you quit smoking, your risk of dying from lung cancer drops by half.Quitting smoking is one of the most important things you can do to improve your own health as well as those around you (through second- and third-hand smoke).SMOKING AFFECTS NON-SMOKERS, TOOIf you are around people who smoke, you are exposed to second- and third-hand smoke, and you are at an increased risk for suering from the health impacts of smoking. People recognize second-hand smoke because they can see it in the air or smell it. Third-hand smoke refers to the chemicals that are in smoke that stay on all the surfaces that are exposed to tobacco smoke including floors, walls, tables and so forth. It also becomes embedded in fabrics and carpeting, and remains on hair, skin and clothing. T obacco is used by some First Nations for ceremony, for appreciation and in spiritual practices. The tobacco traditionally used for spiritual and cultural purposes is not the same as tobacco bought in stores (cigarettes, pipe tobacco, snuff or chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarillos, etc.)KEEP TOBACCO USE TRADITIONAL.This is DNA!

Second-hand smoke lingers long after you finish a cigarette, and is absorbed into furniture, carpets and other materials. This third-hand smoke has the same toxic chemicals as second-hand smoke. Third-hand smoke is especially harmful to babies as they crawl on the floor and put things in their mouths. It is especially important to keep babies' environments smoke-free during pregnancy and after birth as their health is more vulnerable. Opening a window or turning on a fan does not clear out the smoke from a room or car. Studies have shown that there is no level of ventilation that will eliminate the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke spreads from one room to another even if the door of the smoking area is closed. In addition, toxic chemicals can cling to rugs, curtains and furniture and can remain in a room long after someone has smoked there. Explain to family or friends who smoke that second- and third-hand smoke are reasons why you have a smoke-free car, home and outdoor spaces, especially where children play. 10 CanHeal 11the northern way of caring Benefits of quitting tobaccoIF YOU DO SMOKE, YOU ALREADY KNOW YOU SHOULD QUIT. HERE'S WHY: Regardless of how long you have smoked, there are immediate and long-term benets to quitting. Most negative health impacts can be minimized and possible reversed by quitting. 8 hours Carbon monoxide levels drop and oxygen levels increase. 2-3 days The risk of heart attack drops and the sense of smell and taste improve. Lung capacity increases.1 year The risk of heart attack is cut in half.10 years The risk of dying from cancer is cut in half. 15 years The risk of dying from a heart attack is equal to someone who has never used tobacco.WHAT KEEPS SMOKERS SMOKING?Alcohol, caeine and even chocolate can produce changes in our mood, so what's the dierence with nicotine? Perhaps most important, nicotine passes into our brains much quicker than other substances. Nicotine enters your brain within 10 seconds of taking a pu on a cigarette. The nicotine in chewing tobacco and snu is quickly absorbed because your mouth is lled with tiny blood vessels near the surface of your inner cheek and gums.Nicotine is highly addictive because it causes changes in your brain. Fortunately, some of these changes will be reversed right after you quit smoking and more will recover over time. The withdrawal of nicotine is hard. While quitting, nicotine replacement therapy is oered to ease withdrawal.While changes in the brain and body chemistry are a big part of addiction, they don't tell the whole story. Smoking is a learned behaviour. We begin to learn or associate things such as the way we hold or light a cigarette or take it out of the package with the pleasant feeling or sense of relief that it may bring.We also associate tobacco with other things we enjoy, such as drinking coee, alcohol, eating a good meal or having fun with friends. Because smoking often requires us to take a break from our daily duties, we may also associate smoking with the temporary relief of worry, tension, boredom or fatigue. Many people who use tobacco believe that it helps them or does something for them such as stress management or relaxation. As such, the addiction is also related to psychological, emotional and social cues.Many people say they smoke more when they are under stress even though nicotine actually increases the signs of stress like heart rate, blood pressure and muscle tension. But, with practice and preparation we can break old habits and learn new ways of getting the benets we associate with smoking. QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF ABOUT TOBACCO USE: What got you started in the first place? What purpose does tobacco serve in your life now? What does it cost you in terms of your health? Your social life ? Your finances? In how you feel about yourself? What's happening when you feel like you need a smoke ? How does your smoking affect those around you? How does other people 's smoking affect you? What will it take to get rid of the problems this habit brings with it ? 12 CanHeal 13the northern way of caring NOT READY TO QUIT?There are a number of things you can do to help reduce the impact of tobacco use if you are not yet ready to quit.Protect your family, friends and loved ones from the second and third-hand smoke you create by using these strategies: Only smoke outside, with the door closed (ban smoking in your home). Keep a smoking jacket at your door to reduce the levels of third-hand smoke. Don't smoke when driving. Pull over and get out of your car if you need a smoke break.TRYING TO QUIT AND STAY TOBACCO-FREE? Whatever your reason for quitting, there are many strategies and resources available to help you.Try the following: Reduce your use of tobacco products a little bit each day or week. Switch to using nicotine products such as the patch or gum. (Nicotine is not a cancer-causing agent; it is the many additives in tobacco products that lead to the majority of health risks including cancer.) Have support by quitting with a friend, or set a quit date and ask family and friends to help support you to achieve that goal.INFORMATION IN THIS SECTION GARNERED FROM THE FOLLOWING SOURCES:Northern Health Position on Tobacco Reduction (2012) www.northernhealth.ca/AboutUs/PositionStatementsAddressingRiskFactors.aspxU.S. Department of Health and Human Services A Report of the Surgeon General.

Cabbage Lettuce Carrots Broccoli Eggplant Cauliflower Okra Spinach Celery Tomato Radishes Beets TIPS FOR ADDING FRUITS & VEGETABLES TO YOUR DIET: Have chopped-up vegetables and fruits as part of your snack (e.g., veggie sticks and low fat cheese, apple slices and natural peanut butter). Or, try dried fruit with nuts as a snack. Use lots of vegetables such as spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers, and frozen peas in your soups, stews, lasagna, chili, pasta sauce, stir fry, etc. Enjoy veggie platters at parties, or make one for your family as an appetizer. Add fruit to your breakfast. Challenge yourself to try a new fruit or vegetable every month. Pick something at the grocery store; it can be fresh, frozen or canned, and try it out.FRUITS AND VEGETABLESChoose a mixture of fruits and vegetables every day. Variety is important for good health, so change up your choices as much as you can. Vegetables and fruits are: High in bre (to keep your digestive system healthy) Low in fat and calories Excellent sources of vitamins, minerals and phytochemicalsNON-STARCHY VEGETABLES AND CANCER RISKResearch shows that a diet high in non-starchy vegetables may reduce your risk of some cancers such as stomach, mouth and throat. Starchy vegetables include corn, potato and peas. Examples of non-starchy vegetables include: Other non-starchy vegetables, such as garlic, onions and leeks (allium vegetables), may also reduce the risk of stomach cancer. Garlic may protect against colorectal cancer. Research also shows that a diet high in fruit may reduce your risk of some cancers such as lung, stomach, mouth and throat.

As part of a plant-based diet, phytochemicals may help to prevent cancer. Fruit, vegetables, whole grains and legumes (beans), for example, broccoli, brussel sprouts, garlic, onions and citrus fruits are rich sources of phytochemicals. T o lower your risk of cancer, eat the recommended number of servings for vegetables and fruit, and whole grains. BC Cancer Agency Breast Cancer Guide 20 CanHeal 21the northern way of caringCHOOSE WHOLE GRAINS There are many types of grains, such as wheat, rice, oats, barley, corn, rye, quinoa and buckwheat. All of these can be either whole or rened depending on how the grain is processed after harvesting. If the whole seed is left intact, it is referred to as a whole grain. If it is processed where part of the seed is removed, it is a rened grain. Whole grains are higher in bre and have more vitamins, minerals and nutrients.Choose naturally occurring whole grains or foods made from whole grains as part of your daily diet. Look for: Cereals made with whole grains such as oats Many types of rice such as brown rice or wild rice Breads, bagels, English muns and tortillas made with whole grains or with whole-wheat flour (Not all brown bread is made with whole grains; always check the ingredients.) Pastas made with whole grains Corn and popcornLIMIT RED MEAT AND PROCESSED MEATS Beef, pork, lamb, and goat are red meat. Red meat is a valuable source of protein, iron, zinc and vitamin B12. However, many of us eat much more of it than our bodies need, which can increase our risk of cancer. If you eat red meat, choose the leanest meat, and trim any visible fat before cooking. Remember a serving is 3 ounces of cooked meat\u2014smaller than a deck of cards. Choose poultry or sh more often and make up the rest of your meal with vegetables and whole grains.Processed meats are those meats preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or by the addition of preservatives. Examples include ham, bacon, salami, hot dogs and sausages.When meat is processed, cancer-causing substances can be formed. These substances damage cells in the body and research shows that eating processed meat increases the risk of colorectal cancer. When sh or meat is smoked, it is exposed to the smoke of a wood or charcoal re. The foods absorb large amounts of the tar that comes o the smoke. These tars may contain cancer-causing compounds. Substitute sliced chicken or canned sh for processed lunch meats in your sandwiches. Try sh in tacos, ground turkey burgers or a chicken stir fry rather than beef. Try eating a meat-free meal at least once a week or challenge your family to try a meatless day (check out the Meatless Monday movement at www.meatlessmonday.com).TRY MEAT ALTERNATIVESBeans, lentils and dried peas come from a type of plant called legumes. Common types include kidney beans, black beans, navy beans, and green, brown, yellow and orange lentils. Soybean, which is used to make tofu, is another type of legume. Chickpeas (or garbanzo beans) and split peas are commonly used dried peas. BEANS, LENTILS AND DRIED PEAS ARE A NUTRITIOUS AND VERSATILE ALTERNATIVE TO MEAT. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING A LOW-FAT SOURCE OF PROTEIN, THEY PROVIDE FIBRE AS WELL AS B VITAMINS, IRON AND CANCER-FIGHTING PHYTOCHEMICALS. Most legumes are sold dried, canned and sometimes frozen. Dried beans need to soak before cooking so make sure you build in that prep time. Canned beans are easy and quick, but should be rinsed to remove excess sodium, or purchase \"no sodium added\" varieties. Lentils don't require soaking and cook faster than most beans. Moose meat and other wild game meats are lower in fat than domestic meats such as beef, pork and chicken.- BC Cancer Agency, First Nations Survivorship Care Plan TRY BEANS, PEAS AND LENTILS: In a breakfast burrito or wrap To to p a salad such as w ith kidney beans or chickpeas As a dip such as hummus; use hummus as a sandwich filling To make a vegetarian chili using kidney beans, black beans and chickpeas To replace part of the meat in a spaghetti sauce with lentils or tofu In soups. Lentils make a great soup! Try to limit the amount of red meat you eat to 3 servings a week. 22 CanHeal 23the northern way of caringFATS Certain fats like omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids are important to your diet because your body cannot make them, but they have many health benets. Omega 3 fatty acids are essential, but you only need 1-2 g daily. You should be getting enough if you eat foods like fatty sh twice weekly and use canola oil for cooking. Eating large amounts of foods high in omega 3 fatty acids will not provide added benet; it will only increase the total fat in your diet. NOTE: Omega 6 fatty acids should ONLY be consumed in small quantities. In large quantities, they have been shown to be carcinogenic.Omega 3 fatty acids are highest in: Flaxseeds and walnuts Flaxseed, canola and soybean oils Wheat germ Fatty sh such as salmon, trout, mackerel, herring, sardines and char Omega 6 fatty acids are highest in: Corn, sunflower and soybean oils Sunflower, sesame, poppy and pumpkin seeds Wheat germTHE SCOOP ON BUTTERS AND OILSMARGARINE VS. BUTTER; WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? Both butter and margarine can be included in a healthy diet when used in small quantities. They are both high in fat and calories. The dierence is that butter and margarine contain dierent types of fat. Butter contains cholesterol and saturated fat. Hard margarines (the kinds sold in a brick) contain trans fatty acids. Soft margarines however contain mainly unsaturated fats and very little or no trans fatty acids. Therefore, a soft-tub margarine labelled as \"non-hydrogenated\" is a better choice than a hard margarine. Overall, whether you choose butter or soft-tub margarine, the most important thing is to limit how much you use.WHAT KIND OF FAT SHOULD I USE FOR COOKING AND IN SALADS?Vegetable oils are a better choice than hard fats such as butter, lard or shortening. Even in baking, oil is a better choice. See cookbooks and books on healthy eating for recipes for muns, pizza crusts and breads that use small amounts of vegetable oil. WHICH OIL IS BEST?Olive oil is a good choice because it is high in monounsaturated fats with several health benets and an appealing flavour. The flavour is richest in the \"extra virgin\" oil and is particularly tasty with salads. Canola oil is another good choice that is high in monounsaturated fats. It also has the lowest amount of saturated fat and a good balance of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids. Canola oil is less expensive than olive oil so you may want to mix canola and olive oils for your cooking oil to get the advantages of both. Flaxseed (linseed) oil and walnut oil are also good sources of omega 3 fatty acids. If you use one of these oils, buy a small quantity and store it in the refrigerator. It should keep for up to two months. OILS FOR COOKINGSome oils can handle the heat, and some can't. An oil's smoke point is the temperature at which it will start to smoke and break down. When cooking oil starts to smoke, it can lose some of its nutritional value and give food an unpleasant taste. HIGH-HEA T COOKING Use corn, soybean, peanut and sesame oils. They are good for frying and stir-frying.MEDIUM-HEA T COOKING Use olive, canola and grapeseed oils. They have moderately high smoke points, making them good for saut\u00e9ing.FOR SALAD DRESSINGS AND DIPS Use oils with low smoke points, such as flaxseed walnut, olive and canola oil.. Go for ground flaxseed over whole because the ground form is easier for your body to digest, which means you're more likely to get all the benefits. Try adding ground flaxseed to yogurt and fruit or into you muffin or pancake batter. 24 CanHeal 25the northern way of caringSALT AND SUGAR Our bodies need some salt to help maintain a balance of water (hydration). Also, table salt is fortied with iodine, which is important for good thyroid health..But in general, Canadians eat more salt then they need. Too much salt is linked to high blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. Additionally, eating too much salt and salty food may increase your risk of stomach cancer.Much of the salt we eat comes from processed food such as snack foods, bread, sauces, soups and cereal. We also often add salt to our food at the table or in cooking.REMEMBER A FOOD LABELED WITH 15% OR MORE OF YOUR % DAILY VALUE OF SODIUM IS CONSIDERED HIGH IN SALT!Most Canadians also eat too much sugar. Sugars occur naturally in foods such as fruit, milk, honey and syrup. However, most of the sugar we eat has been added to food and drinks to make them taste sweet. Check the ingredients list to see if a food product is high in added sugar. If words like sugar, glucose, honey, corn syrup, fructose, maltose or dextrose are listed, sugar has been added. If you see one of these near the top of the list of ingredients, the product is high in sugar.Foods and drinks with added sugar have lots of calories, but usually contain few nutrients. Eating a lot of these sugary foods makes it easy to eat more than you need and replace other more nutritious food choices which means, which means you are likely to put on weight.Replacing sugar in foods such as cake, candies and soft drinks with articial sweeteners may reduce calories, but it does NOT make them healthy foods.SNACK HEALTHYDid you know that one snack-sized bag of corn chips (1 ounce) has the same number of calories as a small apple, 1 cup of whole strawberries, AND 1 cup of carrots with 1/4 cup of low-calorie dip? Try substituting these healthy snacks for a bag of chips, and you will have a satisfying snack with higher nutrition quality. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.))CALORIC DENSITY The number of calories in a particular amount of food is called \"calorie density\" or \"energy density.\" Look for low-calorie dense foods that do not pack a lot of calories into each bite, but that still keep you full.BREAKFASTLUNCHDINNERCook oatmeal, oat bran, cornmeal or other hot cereal in milk instead of water.Choose a whole grain bread, bun, or tortilla for your sandwich.Wash and slice sweet potatoes, cauliflower, and onions tossed with canola oil and dried herbs. Bake until crisp.Add sliced banana, chopped dried apricots and/or frozen berries to your cereal.Add veggies to your sandwich; try romaine lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, or roasted veggies.Add a dark green leafy salad to your meal \u2014 experiment with spinach, romaine and kale.Try natural peanut butter on your whole grain toast or bagel for protein.Slice leftover chicken or turkey, or mash leftover salmon or hard boiled eggs with a mixture of light mayo and plain yogurt.Try quinoa, bulgur, brown rice, whole wheat pasta or another grain as a side or added to your green salad.Add a couple tablespoons of wheat bran or ground flax and blueberries or sliced banana to your pancake batter.Try a natural nut butter (peanut, almond, cashew, etc.) for a tasty sandwich filling.Mix lean ground beef with ground turkey or ground moose when making hamburgers, meat balls or meatloaf.Try back bacon or turkey bacon rather than side bacon or sausages.To satisfy a sweet tooth, consider fruit salad or a baked fruit crisp.INSTEAD OF...TRY...Fried chicken low-fat dressing2 cups lettuce, grilled tbsp. light balsamic vinaigrette soup1 cup minestrone= 112 calories GROCER Y SHOPPING TIPS T o prepare healthy menus, you need to have healthy ingredients on hand. When grocery shopping, focus on fresh and unprocessed foods. That means spending your time in the produce section, where you can stock up on fruits and vegetables. Look for whole grains and low-fat dairy products. And, don't linger in the snack food and candy aisles; avoid them if you can. Check out farmers' markets during the growing season to see what fresh local produce is available. - Mayo Clinic 26 CanHeal 27the northern way of caringGROCERY SHOPPING TIPSBEVERAGESMany symptoms of fatigue, lightheadedness, bad taste, dryness in the mouth, and nausea can be due to dehydration. It is therefore important to drink enough fluids to remain hydrated. WHAT'S IN A DRINK? Calories from drinks can really add up (not to mention the toll it can have on our wallets!). But there are plenty of ways to reduce the number of calories in what you drink.HEALTHY BEVERAGE CHOICES At the coee shop: At the coee shop, request fat-free or low-fat milk instead of whole milk Forgo the extra flavouring; the flavour syrups used in coee shops, like vanilla or hazelnut, are sugar-sweetened and add calories. Skip the whip. Whipped cream on top of coee drinks adds calories and fat. Order a plain cup of coee with fat-free milk and articial sweetener, or drink it black.FOR STORE-BOUGHT SMOOTHIES: Order a small size. Ask for skim milk or low-fat yogurt. Hold the sugar. Ask that your smoothie be prepared without added sugar; fruit is already naturally sweet.HEALTHY EATING YEAR ROUNDIn the North, we have lucky to have summers that provide lots of tasty and healthy foods from the land, river and sea. If we plan ahead, we can preserve this abundance for healthy and aordable eating all year. Additionally, foraging can provide an amazing connection to our environment and is an aordable way to help us eat nutritious food. Freeze raspberries, blueberries, and other picked fruit in the summer months for smoothies. Make a vegetable soup with summer produce and freeze it for cold winter evenings. Try freezing soup in a mun pan, then popping the soup ''discs\" into a freezer bag for individual portions and minimized space in your freezer. Freeze fresh herbs in some canola oil in ice cube trays. Store them in a freezer bag, and use for flavourful cooking in the fall and winter.

Don't confuse planned snacking with mindless grazing. Sit Down to EatSit, even if only for a cup of tea or an apple. Concentrate on the food in front of you, and enjoy every mouthful. Don't Upsize Your PortionOpt for smaller meals. Eating more often is a great way to keep your metabolism revving high. Don't let yourself get to starving mode: eat regular snacks instead. Try a healthy appetizer like a salad or raw veggies before a meal to help take the edge o your hunger, and help you feel satised with a healthy-sized portion for your main meal. Don't RushEat slowly, chew well, savouring each mouthful. Between bites, put your fork and knife down. Be the last person (not the rst) to nish. Stretch out you meal by 15 minutes to allow your stomach to signal your brain's appetite centre that it's full. Listen to Your StomachPractice stopping eating when you're comfortably full, but not \"stued.\" Try to leave the table feeling satised but not too full or bloated. Remember you can use leftovers for a snack or another meal. Avoid Mindless EatingSeparate your eating from other activities. Most overeating is thoughtless (nibbling on chips at a party, grazing on leftovers after a meal, eating treats and snacks left out at the oce, etc.). Be conscious of where and what you're eating. Use the 90/10 Rule Don't give up all treats; keep them small and occasional. If 90 percent of your intake is healthy, use the remaining 10 percent for an occasional treat. The secret to changing your eating habits for the better is to plan ahead (a day or week in advance). Always shop with a list and remember to eat before you shop. Prepare your snacks for the following day in the evening and have them packed in containers ready to go. 30 CanHeal 31the northern way of caringKEEP TRACK OF WHEN YOU EAT UNHEALTHY FOODSLook at your weekly eating, then think about what leads you to unhealthy foods. Pinpoint the times and situations that lead to unhealthy eating, so you can make a plan for healthier eating. If you regularly make these plans and follow though, they will become habits!COMMON TOPICS OF INTERESTANTIOXIDANTS Some studies suggest that people who eat more vegetables and fruits, which are rich sources of antioxidants (including vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and many other antioxidant phytochemicals), may have a lower risk of some types of cancer. The current advice is to get your antioxidants through food and beverages rather than dietary supplements.ORGANIC FOODS Although people may choose organic foods because they believe them to be healthier and safer, there is not enough evidence to show this is true. Whether you choose organic or non-organic, the important thing is to eat the recommended number of fruits and vegetables servings each day. Additionally, pollutants may be found on both organic and non-organic foods so all vegetables and fruits should be washed thoroughly.AN UNHEALTHY MEAL/SNACK HAPPENS WHENA PLANNED ALTERNATIVEI'm rushed on a weeknight because of post-work commitments or my kids' activities.Cook and freeze chili, stew, lasagna etc. on a weekend afternoon to heat up on a busy weeknight.I resort to the drive-thru on mornings when I'm running late.Prepare yogurt, fruit and granola in a container the night before to eat a healthy breakfast at work.I have a night out with my friends.Plan an activity with your friends such as going on a hike, playing soccer or basketball, cooking a new dish together or taking a dance class.I'm on the road.Pack a cooler with lots of water, fruit, chopped veggies, and a sandwich or two (you'll feel better and save money when travelling). Remember you can stop at a grocery store instead of a restaurant and pick up fresh healthy foods!I'm eating at a friend or family member's house.Suggest a potluck where everyone brings a dish, and you can bring a healthy dish. Or suggest cooking together with a new healthy recipe. Offer to bring a veggie tray for appetizers and/or fruit for dessert.I indulge in ice cream, chips, or treats while watching TV after dinner.Do something to keep you busy and moving in the evening such as going for a walk with a friend, your kids or your pet. If you have a sweet tooth, try making your own popsicles with fruit juice. Don't buy any chips or other treats so there will be less temptation at home. Also try knitting or another activity to keep your hands busy.I'm too tired and hungry to cook a healthy dinner after a long day.Have a few 10-minute options ready like a scrambled egg dinner burrito or a tuna melt that you can make on nights when you need something quick and easy. FRESH, FROZEN AND CANNED \u2014 ARE THERE NUTRITIONAL DIFFERENCES? Yes, but they can all be good choices depending on availability, economics and ability to prepare food. Fresh foods are often considered to have the most nutritional value. However, frozen foods can often be more nutritious as they are picked ripe and frozen quickly, minimizing the nutrients lost between harvest and consumption. Canning is more likely to reduce some of the nutrients because of the high temperatures needed in the canning process. When using canned foods, opt for canned goods without syrup and low in sodium. Choose a variety of forms of fruits and vegetables that fit your nutrition, finances, and taste preferences to ensure you have a healthy and balanced diet. 33the northern way of caringSOY Soy foods such as tofu, soy milk, soybeans, and soy nuts are an excellent source of protein. They are a lower-fat, healthy alternative to meat. Soy contains estrogen-like phytochemicals, which may help reduce the risk of osteoporosis and heart disease. Studies on soy and the risk of cancer are inconclusive. If you're being treated for cancer, talk to your doctor before adding soy to your diet. SUPPLEMENTS\"Evidence from both observational studies and clinical trials suggests that dietary supplements are unlikely to improve prognosis or overall survival after the diagnosis of cancer, and may actually increase mortality.\" (Rock et al, 2012, p. 253) Before taking a supplement, you should try to get the nutrients through dietary sources. Supplements should only be considered if a nutrient deciency is demonstrated.FOOD SAFETY It's not just what you eat that keeps you healthy but also how you cook and prepare it. For general good health, it is important to prepare, cook, and store food with care to kill harmful bacteria that can cause food-borne illnesses. Also, how you prepare your food can aect your cancer risk.AFLATOXIN AND CANCER RISK Aflatoxin increases the risk of liver cancer. Aflatoxin is produced by a certain fungus that can grow on a wide range of foods including cereals, oilseeds, spices, and tree nuts as well as milk, meat, and dried fruit. Nuts such as peanuts, pistachios, and brazil nuts are of most concern. To stop this fungus from developing, store peanuts and natural peanut butter in the refrigerator. Never eat nuts that smell musty, look mouldy or are shriveled, discoloured, or damaged. 32 CanHeal \"I'M NOT A VEGETARIAN. HOW DOES THIS INFORMATION APPLY TO ME?\"The addition of more plant foods to your diet is a healthy choice whether or not you choose to follow a vegetarian diet. Diets that include lean white meats, fish, and red meat in small amounts, can also be healthy. IMPORTANT SAFETY TIPS: Keep foods refrigerated to stop micro-organisms from growing. Thaw meat, poultry, and seafood in the microwave or refrigerator, not on the kitchen counter. Wash your hands before you start handling foods. When handling foods, wash your hands often. Always wash raw vegetables and fruit in clean running water (even if the package says pre-washed). Wash all plates, utensils, and cutting boards that touch raw meat or poultry with hot soapy water before using them again. Use separate cutting boards for raw foods and cooked foods. Foods that need to be kept in the fridge or freezer should be stored as soon as you return home from grocery shopping. If you live far from a grocery store, bring a cooler bag for the cold and frozen items for the drive home. Do not use plastic storage containers to heat up food in the microwave, unless they are labeled microwave safe. Do not eat foods showing signs of mould. 34 CanHeal 35the northern way of caringCOOKING TEMPERATURE AND CANCER RISK For food safety, it is important to cook meat, poultry, and seafood to thoroughly destroy any germs that could cause disease. However, research shows that cooking meat, poultry and sh at high temperatures such as by frying, broiling or barbecuing may increase your risk of cancer. Cooking meats at very high temperatures creates chemicals (heterocyclic amines or HAs) that may increase cancer risk. Regularly cook proteins at lower temperatures by braising, stewing, steaming or roasting. Use high-temperature cooking methods such as barbecuing, broiling or pan frying less often. Marinate meat, poultry, and sh before cooking. Marinating these foods can prevent the formation of cancer-causing chemicals. Use an oil-free marinade that contains a strong acid like lemon juice or balsamic vinegar. IN YOUR COMMUNITY , YOU CAN: Create a healthy cooking club or group. Promote healthy eating in meetings at your workplace. Advocate for cooking, nutrition, meal-planning demonstrations at your local community centre. Join an existing community garden or if your community doesn't have one, advocate for one. Ask community leaders about planting food rather than flowers in communal spaces (raspberry and blackberry bushes in public parks, for example). Advocate for nutrition education for different groups. Support local markets, stores, and restaurants that offer healthy food. Encourage healthy food donations to your local food bank including canned fish, low sodium soups and vegetables. Help friends and family with meal planning and navigating the grocery store. Educate young people in your community about why and how to eat healthy. Share your ideas for healthy eating with your friends and family, and ask them for theirs!INFORMATION GARNERED FROM THE FOLLOWING SOURCES:BC Cancer Agency.

Ease into any new routines to allow your body to adjust. This will also ensure that the changes become a part of your life and not just a phase.\" \u2014 BC Cancer Agency ESSENTIAL FACTS Reduce overall sedentary behaviours. Increase incidental activity such as standing and taking the stairs; E VE R Y MOVE COUNTS! Any form of regular physical activity is important and beneficial. Use a graduated and individualized approach to increase activity levels. Physical activity provides great health benefits for all ages. The more, the better. 38 CanHeal 39the northern way of caringREDUCE SITTING TIMEThe amount of time we spend sedentary, or not moving, can have serious implications for our health. Long periods of inactivity is not only unhealthy, but dangerous to our health. Sitting for more than six hours daily can cause chronic disease, just like smoking, an unhealthy diet, and problematic substance use can.WHAT CAN YOU DO? Decrease your recreational sitting to less than two hours a day; this can lower your risk for colon and breast cancer by up to 30 percent. Watch TV while standing or doing an activity like cooking or on a treadmill/stationary bike. Go for a walk or add a recreational activity to your evening (a workout class, dance lessons, intramural sports team, etc.). Put your computer on a high table so you can stand while you email. Take the stairs to a bathroom on a dierent floor, walk to a colleague's desk instead of sending an email, park your car further from entrances, etc. Swap a sitting activity for an active one.Include a range of activity in your day AS A CANCER SURVIVOR, WHY EXERCISE? Speeds up recovery and lowers the chance of recurrence Improves sense of well-being, mood and self esteem Helps with memory and reduces \"chemo brain\" Improves strength, endurance, muscle and bone strength Increases life expectancy Decreases depression, anxiety and fatigue Decreases symptoms of menopause and arthritis Can reduce risk and severity of comorbid conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and dementia, which cancer survivors are at an increased risk of developing. What are the risks of being sedentary? Increased blood pressure Cancer and cardiovascular disease Decreased quality of life Premature death Break up your sitting time. Even standing for five minutes every hour can reduce your risks. (Try a smartphone app like StandApp and WorkSafe Sam for reminders to stand at work or home.) 40 CanHeal 41the northern way of caring Being active for at least 150 minutes per week can help reduce the risk of: Chronic disease ( such as high blood pressure and heart disease) Premature death It can also help to: Maintain functional independence and mobility Improve fitness Improve or maintain body weight Maintain bone health Maintain mental healthWHAT IS MODERATE AND VIGOROUS ACTIVITY? Moderate activity will cause adults to sweat a little and breathe harder than resting. Examples of moderate activity include walking briskly (approximately 5-8km/hr), leisure cycling, playing golf (walking), general cleaning at home and mowing the lawn.Vigorous activity will cause adults to sweat a lot and be \"out of breath\" . Examples of vigorous activity include running, cross-country skiing, jumping rope, and using an elliptical trainer at a high speed.AEROBICAerobic exercise strengthens our heart and lungs and makes them work more eciently. Any activity that raises the heart rate to an elevated but safe level for a period of time is an aerobic activity.STRENGTHENINGExercises that work our muscles against weight or resistance are called strength exercises. From the age of 30, our muscle strength starts to decrease by a small amount every year. That's why strengthening exercises are important for everyone, especially older adults.Strength exercises can: Improve blood sugar control for people with diabetes Build bone density to reduce the risk of osteoporosis Strengthen core muscles to reduce back painStrength exercises can be done using inexpensive free weights (e.g., dumbbells), weight machines, resistance bands, cans of food or your own body weight. FLEXIBILITYA regular series of flexibility and balance exercises that works our joints through their full range of motion can help us to keep moving and stay active as we age. By staying mobile and improving our balance, we can prevent falls and injuries.HOW TO START GETTING ACTIVE Over time, increase how often you're active and how long you do an activity. Start with short periods of exercise (5-10 minute sessions) and rest after each session. Gradually build up to 20-30 minutes of continuous activity. Work up to being active three-to-ve days a week. PACE YOURSELF Be active when you have energy. Your energy level may change from day to day or throughout the day. Listen to your body. Take breaks or change activities when you need to. Adjust how hard you're working and how long you're active, based on how you're feeling. You may prefer being active every second day so you have time to recover. Do activities that are safe and reasonable for you. Exercise should make you feel better, not more tired or stressed. Always check with your healthcare team before changing your physical activity routine. Start slow! Begin with light activity, then gradually move to moderate and more vigorous activities. BUILD PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTO YOUR LIFEYake note of how you are already active and increase those frequencies. For example, are you active when you babysit your nieces/nephews or your grandkids? Can you play with them more often or take them to the park or play outside with them one day a week after school and work ? Do you take the bus? T ry getting off a stop earlier, or walking to a stop further away before you board. Do you own a dog? Get them out for longer walks each day.42 CanHeal 43the northern way of caring HIGHER INTENSITY ACTIVITY Jogging (5mph) 300 calories burned in 30 minsCycling (leisurely) 300 calories burned in 30 minsRunning (7mph) 430 calories burned in 30 minsSwimming (leisurely) 225 calories burned in 30 minsTe nnis 260 calories burned in 30 minsClimbing stairs 260 calories burned in 30 minsDancing (Disco) 170 calories burned in 30 minsAerobics (low impact) 190 calories burned in 30 minsHiking (cross-country) 225 calories burned in 30 minsVacuuming 130 calories burned in 30 minsWalking (3.5 mph) 140 calories burned in 30 minsGardening (general) 150 calories burned in 30 minsLOWER INTENSITY ACTIVITY CANADIAN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES 65+ YEARS: To achieve health benefits, adults aged 18-64 years should accumulate at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity per week, in bouts of 10 minutes or more.

Consider a stationary reclining bicycle, for example, rather than walking on a treadmill. IF YOU HAVE AN INDWELLING CATHETER OR FEEDING TUBE... avoid pool, lake or ocean water or other microbial exposures that may result in infections. Also, be careful of resistance training of muscles in the area of your catheter to avoid dislodgement. PRECAUTIONSThe effects of cancer treatment may increase the risk of exercise-related injuries and adverse effects. Depending on your situation, specific precautions may be advisable.For example, if you are living with severe anemia, you should delay exercise (other than the activities of daily living) until your anemia has improved. If you are experiencing severe fatigue from therapy, you may not feel up to an exercise program. In this case, try doing just 10 minutes of light activity daily. Survivors undergoing radiation should avoid chorine exposure to irradiated skin (e.g., swimming pools and hot tubs).As always, if you have multiple or uncontrolled comorbidities such as previous heart attacks, heart disease and asthma, it's important to consult with your physician before modifying your exercise levels. IF YOU HAVE COMPROMISED IMMUNE FUNC TION... avoid public gyms and pools until your white blood cell levels return to safe levels.

Remember that physical activity doesn't have to take a lot of time. Even ve minutes a day is a good start. You may be able to combine activities. For example, arrange a \"walking meeting\" to discuss business or family matters, or meet friends for a bike ride rather than a coee. \"I'm too sick.\"You may be too sick for a vigorous or strenuous exercise program (check with your healthcare team), but you can usually nd some ways to be more active throughout your day. Remember you can exercise for one minute several times a day. Enhanced physical tness can help you better cope with your illness and prevent further problems. \"I'm too old.\"You're never too old for some type of physical activity. No matter what your level of tness or age, you can always nd some way to increase you activity, energy and sense of well-being. In fact, tness is especially important as we age to stay mobile and strong. Work with your healthcare team to nd an activity that is right for you. \"I get enough exercise.\"You may meet physical activity guidelines (of at least 150 min/week including two days for strengthening activities), but for most people, their daily jobs and activities do not provide enough sustained exercise to keep them t and energetic. Be sure to add incidental activity to your day and avoid sitting for more than six hours/day. Identifying barriers to physical activityIt is important to identify our exercise barriers in order to overcome them. Here are some common excuses, concerns and worries with possible solutions. What are your barriers? What will be your plan to overcome them? \"It's too cold, hot, dark, etc.\"Weather can be a challenge for physical activity in the North, but it is also an opportunity to have activities and sports for each season! Be flexible and to have the right clothing/gear to stay comfortable. For example, try walking on your lunch break while it is light outside, or try indoor activities such as using a stationary bicycle or a workout DVD. \"Exercise is boring.\"Choose activities that you enjoy to make it easier to sustain regular physical activity. Try doing activities with your friends, kids or grandkids; or try a new sport, activity or class. Add variety to your activities and your routines. For example, vary your walking routes, or choose dierent topics to think or talk about on your walks. \"I'm too tired.\"When we are out of shape, we tend to tire easily, then we don't have energy to exercise because we're too tired. It's a vicious cycle! Break out of the \"too tired\" cycle. Regular activity increases our energy to do the things we like. Build up slowly and adjust your activity as your energy levels grow. \"Exercise is painful.\"The old saying \"no pain, no gain\" is simply wrong. Recent evidence shows that signicant health benets come from gentle, low-intensity, enjoyable physical activity. You may sweat or feel a bit short of breath, but if you feel pain you may be exercising improperly or overdoing it for your body. Check with your instructor or healthcare team; you may need to adjust the level or type of activity you're doing.50 CanHeal 51the northern way of caring IN THE NORTH, WE ARE CREATIVE! Use what you've got. You may not have a gym or a pool in your community, but do you have a skating rink or a pond that freezes over in the winter? What about hiking/walking trails or a lake for canoeing? When you drive into a nearby town for groceries, could you use the pool or tness facilities there before you shop? Can you bike to work or to the store? If not, just park farther away from the store and walk, or use the stairs at lunch time to build incidental activity into your routine. Weather may make activities dicult, but nd activities you like to do both inside and outside (e.g., cross-country skiing when it's nice out; a workout video and an exercise ball when it's not.) If you're returning to work in a camp or isolated setting where physical activity may be more limited, try exercising with your colleagues. Play a pick-up game outside, talk to the camp operators to arrange for tness equipment/space, bring resistance bands and do activities in your room.IN YOUR COMMUNITY , YOU CAN: Work to build or restore physical activity spaces such as a baseball field, walking paths or a communal fitness place. Apply for grant money to support a local physical activity project. Start a snowshoeing, hiking or walking group.

Good health is the product of healthy lifestyle practices including not using tobacco, eating well and being active. Reducing excess body fat lowers your risk of cancer recurrence, occurrence and reduces the risk for many other diseases including heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure, arthritis and dementia. 54 CanHeal 55the northern way of caringPEOPLE WHO HAVE EXCESS BODY FAT\u2014PARTICULARLY IF THEY ARE CARRYING THEIR WEIGHT AROUND THE MID-SECTION\u2014HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF SUBSTANCES THAT STIMULATE CELL DIVISION CIRCULATING IN THEIR BLOOD.HOW IS BODY FAT ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER RISK?The fat we store on our bodies is not simply extra weight. Fat cells produce estrogen, which promotes cell growth. They also produce a variety of proteins that cause inflammation and insulin resistance, which in turn also promote cell growth and cell reproduction. The more often cells grow, reproduce or divide, the more opportunity there is for cancer to develop.Fat stored at the waist is more active in producing these growth stimulants. So people who are overweight\u2014particularly if they are carrying their weight around the mid-section\u2014have high levels of substances that stimulate cell division circulating in their bloodGaining weight can be very easy in our daily lives. Things like inexpensive processed foods, modern conveniences that make physical exertion unnecessary, and TV and computers that keep us sedentary for long periods of time, all work against us to maintain a healthy weight. It's important to remember that being at a healthy body weight does not mean being skinny. Skinny does not equal healthy. HOW DO WE GAIN WEIGHT?Weight is gained when we consume more calories than we burn. Weight gain can sneak up on us quickly. In fact, if we consume just 100 calories more than we burn each day, we'll put on a pound in a little more than a month, and almost 30 pounds in three years. Almost half of Canadians are overweight and 15% are obese. This puts us at increased risk for breast, colorectal, esophagus, kidney, pancreas and uterine cancer. - Canadian Cancer Society Determining Your Body Mass Index (BMI) HEIGHT WEIGHT100 130 160 190 220 250 5'2 5'5 5'7 5'9 6'1 BMI is an assessment tool for helping to determine your health.

Make sure the tape is straight and snug but doesn't compress your skin and measure after breathing out. In general, the risk of developing health problems, including cancer, increases as waist circumference increases above 102 cm (40 inches) in men and 88 cm (35 inches) in women. Even though a person's BMI may be in the normal weight range, a high waist circumference indicates some health risk.Waist circumference is another indicator of health risk associated with excess abdominal fat (fat around the belly). Excess fat around the waist and upper body (an \"apple\" body shape) is associated with a greater health risk than having more fat in the hip and thigh areas (a \"pear\" body shape). 1.

Check your skin regularly and talk to your doctor about any abnormalities like moles, scaly patches or lumps. SUN SAFETY62 CanHeal 63the northern way of caringWhile being outside in the sun can feel good, we have to protect our skin from the sunlight at the same time. In Canada, sunlight is strong enough to cause skin cancer and premature aging of the skin. And in British Columbia, we have the highest rates of melanoma [the most serious type of skin cancer] in the country. The risk of skin cancer today is greater than it was 20 years ago and continues to increase. WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT SKIN CANCER? T he chance of developing skin cancer in BC is about 1 in 7 . Skin cancer can kill you. All skin cancers need to be treated and that involves surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Skin cancer can leave you scarred for life. Sun exposure also causes wrinkling, sagging skin, freckles, moles and cataracts.HOW DOES THE SUN CAUSE SKIN CANCER?The sun's rays enter the skin and harm the DNA within skin. The body naturally works to repair the damage, but it may not be able to x everything. This can result in uncontrolled cell growth, leading to the development of skin cancer. Sunburns and suntans are both signs of skin damage. Repeated sun exposure over the years may result in wrinkles, mottling of skin colour, and skin cancer.
