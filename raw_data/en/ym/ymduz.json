Homeopathy was developed in the 1700's and was created based on the principle that we can stimulate healing responses to diseases by administering substances that mimic the symptoms of those diseases in healthy people. Clinical homeopath, Lyn Farrugia, explains the evolution of homeopathy, how she uses homeopathic remedies in her practice, as well as the safety and efficacy of remedies and some ways to use them right away for common issues like insect bites or injuries.

Homeopathy is a system of medicine developed in the 1700s by a pharmacist named Samuel Hahnemann. He experimented on himself by taking quinine (a material dose) it that was used at the time to treat malaria. He was interested in seeing how medicines work. He began to develop symptoms of malaria after taking the quinine for a while. So, it showed that the substance causes the same symptoms in a healthy person that it was curing in a sick person. 2. He diluted the quinine thousands of times so there was nothing left of the material substance other than the energetic imprint (molecular structure was imprinted on the water molecule). He gave the deleted version to all nine of his healthy children who after taking it for a while began to develop symptoms of malaria. He discovered that you can give a material substance in the form of its energetic blueprint without the toxic effects that the material dose has (Example mercury, arsenic). 3. In most of the world, homeopathy is revered and widely used. Some hospitals are homeopathic and many doctors use it because there's no conflict like here in the US where a Dr. has to choose homeopathy or allopathic (pharmaceuticals). The Queen of England has her own personal homeopath and the monarchy for many years has had a personal homeopath on staff. 4. Homeopathy is a form of energy medicine. There are no side effects. (Don't ever take a medicine when you're healthy if you don't need it because if you take it for a long time it can create symptoms). 5. We develop symptoms when we are out of ease. 6. When people tell their story they begin to heal because they become aware of where they are stuck, their stressors and vulnerabilities. In the vulnerability is where we find the strength: our humanity, individuality and uniqueness. 7. Homeopathy is holistic medicine that incorporates body, mind, and spirit. Physical symptoms will correlate with emotions and mental symptoms. A remedy is selected that fits that particular picture. 8. You get your power back when you realize you can heal yourself and trust your body. 9. Healing is a slow unwinding of patterns, practices, ways of being and thinking. 10. Symptoms are a body 's way of releasing where the stress as held. The symptoms are information and a way to assess if someone is getting better. 11. Homeopathy works well for acute injuries and illnesses. Remedies are sold on Amazon and in health food stores by Boiron. It tells you exactly which remedy you need for the symptoms that you are experiencing. For example: Arnica is for bruising, accident, concussion, shock to the body, falls and injuries. Apis and Ledum are used for insect bites, stings, red raised bumps, and itchiness. 12. Remedies are very inexpensive, easily accessible, last forever, have no side effects, provide tremendous healing.

You are born with an innate intelligence. Your body knows what to do. You know how to heal. 2. When you feel sick, worried, or feel out of sorts, tap in to the understanding that you know how to heal. Knowing that you have the capacity to heal will lead you on a path to wellness. Lyn graduated from the Pacific Academy of Homeopathic Medicine, Berkeley, Ca in 1994. I have been a practicing homeopath and health educator for more than 30 years, working with individual clients and in community settings both in the Bay Area of California and in New Jersey (since 2010). She works with clients in person, on the phone or via face-time. She enjoy the art and science of homeopathy and complementary modalities because it weaves the story of the person into what will eventually lead them to finding their way back to wellness: with remedies, herbs, and/or supplements. Her job is a source of continued inspiration and hope for helping people and the planet to heal. Her goal is always to promote Happiness, Healing and Health.
