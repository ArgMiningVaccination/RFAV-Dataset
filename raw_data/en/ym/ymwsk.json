Have patient remove themselves from the mold infested environment and/or have the mold remediated . Healing cannot begin to occur until this happens. 2. Have patient begin antifungal treatment such as Nystatin or natural botanicals that are effective against mold. The botanicals that seem to be the most effective so far include: Grapefruit Seed Extract , Caprylic Acid or combination products containing these such as Candida Formula for adults and Candida Yeast Formula for children. These should be given 2 -3x daily away from probiotics and binders . Antifungal treatment is recommended for 3 months before retesting. 3. Begin dosing Tri-Fortify Liposomal Glutathione with a measured \u00bd (2.5 ml) - 1 tsp (5 ml) 2x dose daily based on age and weight. It may be necessary to start low and slow with some very sick and sensitive patients. 4. Add a binder to eliminate mycotoxins such as Activated Char coal or G.I. Detox (dose 1 or more caps 2x daily ) or MycoPul (1 cap, 1x daily) . Another binder option is chlorella and can be found in NDF Plus and Primary Detox (which is good for children and also le ss constipating ). Binders must be given on an empty stomach 1 hour before or 2 hours after food or administration of any supplements or medications because they will bind these as well . (Suggestions : Immediately upon waking, prior to going to bed or when waking during the night) . With some patients, this may be difficult and getting a bind er in once daily may be all that is possible and will still be helpful. If constipation occurs, add enough Magnesium Citrate or Buffered Vitamin C to keep the bowels moving, which is very important while detoxifying. 5. A daily, high quality containing multivitamin /mineral formulation with sufficient B - complex such as Daily Resource can be beneficial. Dosing antioxidants such as Buffered Vitamin C , Liposomal Vitamin , Vitamin E , or Antioxidant Formula given 2x daily is also needed to reduce le vels of oxidative stress. 6.
