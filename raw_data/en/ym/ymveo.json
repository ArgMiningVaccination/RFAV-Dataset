Yet The Journal of the American Medical Association tells us that 70 per cent of some European populations now use complementary therapies. In Australia such usage is estimated at 50 per cent. Our favourite appears to be acupuncture, although herbalism, homeopathy and chiropractic are popular, too. In the United States, the paradigm has shifted altogether: more patients visit complementary therapists than GPs. Survey after survey tells us that around the Western world, alternative care clients tend to be younger, better educated, and more often female and employed. Eight years ago David Blaine was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis - an arthritic condition which, his rheumatologist told him, would leave him with a fused spine and joints and endless pain. \"So I started reading up on diet and exercise,\" Blaine says. \"I soon dropped wheat and dairy - they're major allergens - and started running and stretching. I cut out cigarettes and most alcohol. First, I got my mobility back and then the pain went. \"Later, a homeopath reduced my sensitivity to wheat. A network chiropractor - they're the 'energy medicine' end of the chiropractic spectrum - got my back mobile again. Finally, a nutritionally aware GP got me on to various supplements such as fish oils and counselled me on the emotional components to my illness - to make sure it stayed away. \"Since 1994 my ESR - which is a blood test for inflammation - has gone down from 43, which is very inflamed, to three, which is at the bottom end of the normal range.\" Which did Blaine find the most useful of the holistic therapies? \"The first one - reading. Knowledge is power. I use experts, but it's crucial to develop your own discrimination.\" Monash University's Dr Marc Cohen, organiser of the Byron Bay conference, sees the shift to holism as inevitable, because \"we're living in a time when the wisdom of many different cultures and philosophies is available to us\". Governments are beginning to respond. The Victorian Government is the first outside China to regulate traditional Chinese medicine. Australia has 16 university degree courses in \"unorthodox\" practices. Alison Verhoeven, manager of medical school accreditation at the Australian Medical Council, says: \"The AMC recommends that medical schools incorporate some teachings on alternative/unorthodox medicine within their curricula.\" It's a big change from attitudes towards medical training of the recent past. Medicare, it seems, is not convinced. One of the conference speakers, Dr Karel Hromek from Mullumbimby, says: \"The Health Insurance Commission [which administers Medicare] has not been favourable to holistic medicine, because doctors who do that sort of medicine spend a long time with their patients. The lights flash up in Canberra and they get hassled to come back within the norm of shorter consultations.\" In addition to his science and medical degrees, Hromek has trained in hypnotherapy, acupuncture, massage, homeopathy, herbalism, naturopathy and allergy. \"I get a lot more difficult cases, which suits my training,\" he says. \"If it doesn't get fixed by my colleagues, who are great at what they do, it usually means it's outside their square. The best patient for me is someone who's been thoroughly investigated by a specialist who has thrown their hands in the air. I like that patient, because I know I don't have to delve too much into the orthodox. I can look outside the square, and usually find the answer.\" Where might that answer typically lie? \"Generally food things, or lifestyle and environment things. For instance, doctors know there are things called heavy metals which are poisonous, but they don't really do much about them, because they weren't pushed in their undergraduate training. And yet we've all probably got heavy metals in us.\" For more difficult physical problems, Dr Hromek employs the \"mind-body route\". \"The process involves cognitive therapy - trying to realign the patient's attention to their thinking. But I link it also with subconscious work - for example guided imagery, the relaxation response or hypnosis. The synergy is very strong when the subconscious and the conscious work together.\" A study in Minnesota, US, found that among 4000 holistic care patients, the \"perceived efficacy\" of therapies ranged from 76 per cent for hypnosis to a startling 98 per cent for \"energy medicine\" - until now seen as one of the least scientific modalities. Popular in such forms as reflexology, reiki and cranio-sacral rebalancing, energy medicine is based on a \"primal force\" - which modern physics says does not exist. Dr Cohen, who has honours degrees in medicine and medical science and a second PhD in electrical engineering, has written a paper for the conference suggesting that the \"force\" described by these approaches - it's called chi in China, and prana in India - is less like electricity than what biologists call \"information\". \"There are lots of good parallels there,\" Cohen says. \"Chi is made up of yin and yang, which are polar opposites, and information is made up of the polar opposites of zero and one - the binary digits. And if you think about how information flows through your body, it flows through many different informational substances - proteins, peptides and neuropeptides - as well as flowing through nervous conduction, through mechanical forces and through direct current electrical pathways. It's more about flow and process than about structure.\" Other speakers at what promises to be a very eclectic gathering include Dr Sandra Cabot of \"liver-cleansing diet\" fame, Professor Steven Aung of Canada, a medical consultant for the World Health Organisation and traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, and Dr Brenda Davies, a British psychiatrist and spiritual healer. \"There are some quacks out there,\" says ex-arthritic David Blaine. \"But generally holistic medicine "}
