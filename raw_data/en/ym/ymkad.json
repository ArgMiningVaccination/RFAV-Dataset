Plain language summary A woman's health prior to conception is critical to the outcome of h er pregnancy and may have a lifelong impact on her child's health. There is a lot that women can do pri or to pregnancy to optimise their health including lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet and appropriate supplementat ion. Pre-pregnancy care helps find issues that may affect a woman's pregnancy, so that steps can be taken to manage potential problems prior to pregnancy. 2. Summary of recommendations Recommendation 1 Grade Medical history An assessment of any medical problems and a discussion of how they may affe ct, or be affected by, a pregnancy should be undertaken. Stabilisation of pre -existing medical conditions and assessment of mental health status prior to a pregnancy is necessary to optimise pregnancy outcomes. Consensus -based recommendation Recommendation 2 Grade Reproductive carrier screening All women and couples planning pregnancy should be offered reproductive car rier screening. If there is an increased risk of a heritable disor der, based on the family history or ethnic background, then pre -pregnancy genetic counselling should be offered t o assist in determining the couple's risk of an affected child and to pro vide information about options for carrier screening, preimplanta tion genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis and postnatal management. Consensus -based recommendation Recommendation 3 Grade Vaccinations Vaccination history for SARSCoV -2, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis should be checked and maintained as per recommendations published by the relevant Australian and New Z ealand Government bodies. Hepatitis B, rubella and varicella immunisation s hould be considered for women with incomplete immunity. Consensus -based recommendation Recommendation 4 Grade Lifestyle recommendations Healthy weight Active steps to correct high BMI (dietary, exercise and where appropriate consideration of bariatric surgery) prior to a pregnancy sh ould be recommended. Supplementation Folic acid should be taken for a minimum of one month before conception and for the first 3 months of pregnancy. The r ecommended dose is at least 0.4mg daily. Where there is an increased risk of NTD (anti -convulsant medication, pre -pregnancy diabetes mellitus, previous child or family history of NT D, BMI >30), a 5mg daily dose should be used. Consensus -based recommendation Pre pregnancy counselling (C -Obs 3a) Page 4 of 12 Substance use Counselling and pharmacotherapy should be considered for either or bo th parents when relevant. Advice to women that there is no known safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is appropriate. 3. Introduction All women planning a pregnancy are advised to consult their General Practitioner with a view to: 1. Detecting and assessing any specific health problems in the woma n or her partner that may be relevant, so that these can be appropriately managed prior to the pre gnancy. 2. Obtaining advice about optimising personal health care and lif estyle with pregnancy in mind. Other health care professionals (such as obstetricians, infer tility specialists, and midwives), may also be presented with a valuable opportunity to assess and counsel a woman prior to a planned pregnancy. 4. Discussion and recommendations 4.1 Clinical assessment Most important is a detailed medical history and clinical examina tion. The clinical examination should include blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), auscultation of heart sounds, and where relevant breast exami nation and cervical screening test. 4.2 Medical history An assessment of any medical problems and a discussion of how they may affe ct, or be affected by, a pregnancy should be undertaken. Stabilisation of pre -existing medical conditions and assessment of mental health s tatus prior to a pregnancy is necessary to optimise pregnancy outcomes. Where serious medical cond itions are known to exist, multidisciplinary pre -pregnancy planning should be undertaken. Women at increased risk for specific medical conditions (eg. thyroid disease, nutritional or vitamin D deficiency, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, thromboembolism) should be teste d and managed appropriately before conception. 4.3 Genetic/Family history Pre-pregnancy screening for inheritable genetic conditions is preferabl e to antenatal screening as this provides mor e options for carrier couples. All women and couples contemplating pregnancy should be offered reproductive carrier screening (RCS) if this has not already been undertaken. If there is an increased risk of a heritable condition based on the family histor y or ethnic background then pre -pregnancy genetic counselling should be offered to determine the couple's risk of an affected child and to provide information about option s for specific carrier screening, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis and po stnatal management. Refer to College Statement Prenatal screening and diagnosis of c hromosomal and genetic conditions in the fetus in pregnancy (C -Obs 59) Pre pregnancy counselling (C -Obs 3a) Page 5 of 12 4.4 Medication use It is important to review all current medications including over the counter medicines, with regard to their appropriateness and teratogenic potential. Consideration may need to be given to changing medication prior to a pregnancy with a view to achieving the dual objectives of optim ising disease control while minimising terat ogenic risk. 4.5 Vaccinations All women considering a pregnancy should be aware of their va ccination status and, if uncertain, liaise with their general practitioner. Vaccination history for SARSCov -2, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, diphtheria, te tanus and pertussis should be checked and maintained as per recommendations p ublished by the relevant Australian and New Zealand Government bodies . Hepatitis B, rubella and varicella immunisation should be considered for women with incomplete immunity. Pre gnant women should be immunised against influenza. dTpa vaccine for Pertussis is recommended as a s ingle dose during the third trimester of each pregnancy. The optimal time for vaccination is early in the third trimester between 28 and 32 weeks but the vaccine can be administered from 20 weeks onwards.1 4.6 Lifestyle recommendations 4.6.1 Healthy weight/nutrition/exercise A healthy, well balanced diet is strongly recommended before, during a nd after pregnancy.1, 2 Discussion regarding weight management is appropriate with coun selling against being over or underweight. High BMI (>30) is now one of the commonest and most i mportant risk factors for infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Such risks can manifest even before conception and implantation. High BMI has been shown to affect the health of the human oocyte and the quality of the ea rly embryo. 3, 4 High BMI has an adverse impact on the rates of miscarriage, stillbirth and fetal abnormality. Further, a high BMI exposes the mother to an increased risk of many pregnancy and anaesthetic c ompl ications. There is also increasing recognition of the intergenerational effects of maternal obe sity that may manifest during childhood with obesity and/or later on in adult life with increased risk of metab olic disease. Active steps to correct obesity (dietary, exercise and where appropriate consideration of bariatri c surgery) prior to a pregnancy are worthwhile. A recommendation for moderate intensity exercise and asses sment of any nutritional deficiencies is appropriate. Excessive caffeine consumption (> 300mg/day; equivalent to 3 -4 cups of brewed coffee/day) should be avoided. 5 Refer to RANZCOG statement on Obesity in Pregnancy (C -Obs 49) 4.6.2 Folic acid and iodine supplementation It is recommended that folic acid should be taken for a minimum of one month bef ore conception and for the first 3 months of pregnancy. The recommended dose of fol ic acid is at least 0.4mg daily to aid the prevention of neural tube defects (NTD). Where there is an increased risk of NTD (anti -convulsant medication, pre - pregnancy diabetes mellitus, previous child or family h istory of NTD, BMI >30), a 5mg daily dose should be used. Pre pregnancy counselling (C -Obs 3a) Page 6 of 12 The NHMRC recommends women should start a dietary supplementation of 150mcg of iodin e prior to a planned pregnancy or as soon as possible after finding out they are pregnant.6 The NZ Ministry of Health recommends women should start dieta ry supplementation of folic acid when planning a pregnancy (ideally for at least four weeks before conce ption and 12 weeks after conception). The dose of folic acid should either be a low dose of 800 mcg per day, or a high dose of 5 mg per day, depending on the perce ived risk of having a NTD affected pregnancy.7 4.6.3 Smoking, alcohol and substance use Cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and substance use dur ing pregnancy can have serious fetal and neonatal consequences and should be stopped before conception. Paterna l tobacco smoking pre -conception has been associated with sperm DNA damage and increased risk o f malignancy in their children. 8-12 Counselling and pharmacotherapy should be considered for either or bo th parents when relevant. Advice to women that ther e is no known safe level of alcohol consumption during pregn ancy is appropriate. 4.6.4 Travel and environmental risks Couples planning pregnancy should consider any environmental risks when travelling. Steps should be taken to reduce the chance of infection at the time of conc eption and during the remainder of the pregnancy by: i. Avoiding travel to affected areas while attempting conception ii. For advice on considerations while traveling overseas plea se refer to DFAT website 4.7 Healthy environment Assessment of the risk of exposure to toxins or radiation in the h ousehold, work place or at recreational activity and discussion to minimise the exposure is worthwhile. 4.8 Investigations Further assessment should be guided by the findings on history and exa mination. Patients should receive advice with respect to where and when to attend i n early pregnancy and may wish to have their options of antenatal care discussed.
