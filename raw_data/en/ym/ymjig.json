Getting a medical diagnosis can be really scary. It often requires huge changes to your entire life. You may not want to live a life around medications and doctor appointments. How do you get the information to heal yourself and limit or avoid medication and chronic pain? Many therapists and doctors don't have training in mind-body tools that can enhance or replace medication and talk therapy. You may feel confused, isolated, or overwhelmed trying to build a healthy lifestyle or process trauma. Sometimes it even feels like you've lost hope and nothing is left. We can support you and fight beside you to get back on your feet, get your mind clear and resilient, and build habits to set healthy boundaries and release trauma and anxiety after a big life event, transition, illness, or injury. Our services work by themselves or alongside your current team of therapists and physicians. Each session can take place in a variety of locations chosen by you and your therapist when you make your appointment. You are in control of your experience and we are here to support a full transformative recovery on your terms. What is Mind Body Therapy? Mind Body Therapy is a whole body form of health care. The roots of this therapeutic practice date back over 5000 years. Our center supports mind body therapists who have the highest level of evidence informed training and clinical experience in this quickly growinghealthcare field. Our evidence based practices in meditation, resilience training, yoga, and breath awareness are as effective as physical therapy and medication as treatment for depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. Mind body therapy is used all over the country by hospitals, physicians, and therapists. The VA is one of the largest organizations to adopt mind-body therapies as treatment options for PTSD, chronic pain, and supporting research to further this healthcare field. Mind body therapy sessions focus on all things that are currently possible in your body that give you control, power, and wisdom to move through even the darkest challenges.
