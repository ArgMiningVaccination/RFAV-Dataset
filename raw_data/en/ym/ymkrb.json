History On March 21, 1906 the Kentucky General Assembly approved legislation to establish two teacher training institutions, or \"normal schools,\" in the state. A locating commission chose Bowling Green to be the site of one, and the Western Kentucky State Normal School was created. The new state -supported school took over the building and student body of the privately owned Southern Norma l School. The owner of the Southern Normal School, Henry Hardin Cherry, had been actively involved in the campaign to establish teacher training schools and became the institution's first president. Classes began on January 22, 1907. On February 4, 1911 th e school moved to its present site on \"the Hill,\" approximately 125 feet above downtown Bowling Green and formerly the site of the Pleasant J. Potter College. Over the next decade, the curriculum focused on teacher training and certification. In 1922, the state renamed the institution Western Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College and authorized it to grant four -year degrees. The first such degrees were awarded in 1924. The campus expanded in 1927, when it merged with Ogden College, a private sch ool for young men located on the east side of the Hill. The name was shortened to Western Kentucky State Teachers College in 1930, and the following year the first graduate degree was offered. In the 1950s and 1960s, both the curriculum and campus underwent major reorganization and expansion. In 1963, the institution merged with the Bowling Green C ollege of Commerce. Along with The G raduate S chool, the Bowling Green College of Commerce became a separate college within the academic structure. In 1965 , the Board of Regents approved the formation of three more colleges: the Potter College of Liberal Arts, the College of Education, and the Ogden College of Science and Technology. On June 16, 1966, Western Kentucky State College became Western Kentucky Un iversity. More colleges and reorganization followed throughout the years as WKU continued to expand. The Bowling Green Community College was established in 1986. The College of Health and Human Services was established in 2002, and the Division of Extend ed Learning and Outreach launched in 2003. An administrative unit since 1994, University College was reorganized in 2009 as an academic unit; it now houses those units and programs formerly part of the Bowling Green Community College . In 2008, the WKU Boar d of Regents approved creation and development of a fully-independent Honors College at WKU. In 2011, the first doctoral degrees were awarded through the College of Education and Behavioral Sciences. In 2011 and 2013 two new professional practice doctoral degrees, the Doctor of The University THE UNIVERSITY Western Kentucky University | 2017-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 5 Nursing Practice and the Doctor of Physical Therapy, were established, and in 2015 the Doctor of Psychology was added. WKU's six academic colleges are: College of Education and Behavioral Sciences College of Health and Human Serv ices Gordon Ford College of Business Ogden College of Science and Engineering Potter College of Arts & Letters University College In addition, the Dixie and Pete r Mahurin Honors College offers high -achieving students the environment of a small, highly selective college within the framework of the larger university.

The opening and closing dates are given in the Academic Calendar, which is published yearly. S pecific information about the summer and winter terms is available at www.wku.edu/delo . Unit of University Credit \u2014The unit of credit is a semester hour. Classification of Students \u2014Beginning students are classified a s freshmen; students with a minimum of 30 semester hours earned, as sophomores; 60 hours earned, as juniors; and 90 hours earned, as seniors. Course Load \u2014To be considered a full -time undergraduate student, one must carry a minimum of 12 hours each semester . Students who wish to enroll for 20 -21 semester hours must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or above. Registration and Student Schedule Changes \u2014 After classes begin, registration for a full -time course load and / or changes in schedules may be made only within the first six class days of a semester or the first three days of a bi - term. Courses that do not meet at least twice during the first six class days may be added through, but not past, the day of the second class meeting. During a semeste r, a student may withdraw from a course with a grade of \"W\" or \"F\" under the following con ditions. It is recommended faculty members inform students of this \"W\" period deadline. A student is permitted to withdraw from any course with a grade of \"W\" through the midpoint of the semester. See the Academic Dishonesty section for exception information. After the midpoint of the semester, any student dropping a course receives an automatic \"F.\" However, when there are extenuating circumstances, and at the discret ion of the faculty member and the department head, the student may be permitted to withdraw with a \"W\" instead of \"F.\" During a bi -term, a student may drop a course with a grade of \"W\" or \"F\" under the following conditions: A student is permitted to withdr aw from any course with a grade of \"W\" through the midpoint of the bi -term. After the midpoint of the bi -term, any student dropping a course receives an automatic \"F.\" However, when there are extenuating circumstances, and at the discretion of the faculty member and the department head, the student may be permitted to withdraw with a \"W\" instead of \"F.\" Students should refer to the Registration Guide ea ch term for specific dates affect ing schedule changes. Attendance Policy \u2014Registration in a course obligates the student to be regular and punctual in class attendance. Students should make certain their names are on the class roll. If an error has been made in registration, it is the stude nt's responsibility to see the error is corrected in the Office of the Registrar. It is the individual instructor's responsibility to inform students of the guidelines for implementing the instructor's attendance policy, in writing within one week of the start of the pertinent semester/term/summer session. Students who cease attending class are expected to report to the Office of the Registrar to initiate withdrawal procedures. Withdrawal deadlines are published each term in the Registration Guide. Excessive absenteeism frequently contributes to poor academic achievemen t. An instructor who determines a student's absenteeism is inconsistent with the instructor's stated policy should either counsel w ith the student or request the Academic Advising & Retention Center arrange a counseling session with the student. Excessive absenteeism may result in the instructor's dismissing the student from the class and recording a failing grade, unless the student officially withdraws from the class before the withdrawal deadline. If the student withdraws from the university after the en d of the official withdrawal period, excessive absenteeism may be one of the considerations in the instructor's deciding whether circumstances justify a \"W\" or an \"F\" in the course. The normal appeal process is available to the student who wants to appeal the decision of the instructor. When a student is absent from class because of illness, death in the family, or other justifiable reasons, it is the student's responsibility to consult the instructor at the earliest possible time. Contact AARC for guidanc e (270) 745 - 5065. The AARC provides class attendance notification services as requested by students and faculty. When requested by students, notifications of absences resulting from personal emergencies are relayed to faculty. In addition to this official n otification, it is the student's responsibility to contact each professor to make arrangements to complete missed assignments and tests. The AARC also notifies students of excessive absences reported by faculty. ACADEMIC INFORMATION 30 Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog Students who, without previous arrangement w ith the instructor or department, fail to attend the first two class meetings of a course meeting multiple times per week or the first meeting of a class that meets one time per week MAY be dropped from the course. Nonattendance for a web -based course shal l be defined as failure to perform meaningful academically -related activity (including, but not limited to, the following: submitting an academic assignment, taking an exam, participating in an online discussion about academic matters) within one week of t he course start date without previous arrangements with the instructor or department. Attendance Notification The AARC provides class attendance notification services as requested by students and faculty. When requested by students, notifications of absen ces resulting from personal emergencies are relayed to faculty. In addition to this official notification, it is the student's responsibility to contact each professor to make arrangements to complete missed assignments and tests. The AARC also notifies st udents of excessive absences reported by faculty. Military Absence P olicy for Official Military D uties and Veteran Administration Medical Appointments Instructors are expected to show flexibility to Military and Veteran students who have required absences due to military duties or Veteran Administration medical appointments. These absences are mandated and beyond the students' control. Instructors should not penalize absences of this type in any way. Accommodations and specific timeframes to make u p all missed assignments , quizzes, and tests will be given and mutually agreed upon by the instructor and student. Students are responsible for notifying faculty members of absences as far in advance as possible, when possible, and for ensuring that their absence is documented. Absences can be verified by official orders, appointment notifications, or through the Office of Military Student Services. Students called to duty for an extended amount of time should be referred to the Military Withdrawal policy. Auditing of Courses \u2014An auditor enrolls and participates in a course without expecting to receive academic credit. The same registration procedure is followed , and the same fees are charged as for courses taken for credit. An audited course is not applicable to any degree or certificate program. Regular class attendance is expected of an auditor. Other course requirements, which may be obtained in writing from t he instructor, will vary depending on the nature of the course. Students interested in auditing a course should secure permission from the instructor and discuss course requirements prior to enrolling. Failure to meet course requirements may result in the auditor being withdrawn from the course at the request of the instructor. A successful audit will be recorded on the transcript with the designation AU. Any change from audit to credit must be done by the last day to add a class. Changes from credit to au dit must be done by the last day to drop a class with a grade of \"W.\" Refunds for withdrawals from audited courses will be prorated on the same basis as refunds for withdrawals from courses taken for credit. Global Studies Designation \u2014As part of its commit ment to be \"a leading American university with international reach,\" WKU offers all students the opportunity to earn a Global Studies Designation as part of their undergraduate education. This designation may be combined with any major. Students who comple te the requirements outlined below will receive the \"Emphasis in Global Studies\" designation on their official transcript. Requirements include: 1. Completion of a minimum of twenty -four (24) credit hours of coursework with substantial internation al content.

Undergraduate Student Enrollment in Graduate Courses \u2014Undergraduate students at Western Kentucky University may request to enroll in graduate courses by submitting an \"Undergraduate Taking Graduate Courses\" form to the Graduate School. Conditions for approval include: at least 75 undergraduate credit hours earned; and ACADEMIC INFORMATION Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 31 a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 Undergraduate students m ay accumulate a maximum of 12 graduate credits. In addition, undergraduate students are restricted to a maximum of 15 hours enrollment per term, including graduate and undergraduate credits. All graduate coursework will be on the graduate transcript. To mo ve the coursework to the undergraduate transcript students should contact the Office of the Registrar. Schedule Changes by the University \u2014The institution reserves the privilege at all times of canceling any course for which the enrollment is not sufficient to justify its continuation and to make any other adjustments in the schedule that seem necessary. Changes in Offerings and Policies \u2014The University reserves the right to make changes as required in course offerings, academic policies and other rules and r egulations affecting students to be effective whenever determined by the University. Academic Freedom \u2014The University desires every student experience freedom in academic pursuits. Academic freedom, however, is not irresponsibility \u2014it is the opportunity to pursue truth. Grade -Related Information Grade Point Average \u2014The overall grade point average is defined as the ratio of the total number (including transfer work) of quality points to the total number of GPA hours attempted. The WKU grade point average is d efined as the ratio of the total number of quality points to the total number of GPA hours attempted for courses taken only through Western Kentucky University. Grade Recording \u2014Grades are recorded by the Office of the Registrar as reported by the faculty a t the end of each term. No grade filed in that office may be changed except via a written statement from the instructor certifying that an error has been made. All conditions must be removed before the student will be recommended for any certificate or degree. Grade Reports \u2014It is recommended that some graded evaluation be accomplished by the end of the first six weeks equal to at least 20% of the student's final grade. Final grades are accessible online through TopNet. Developmental Course Grading \u2014Courses numbered 050 -099 are developmental courses; grades earned in these courses will not count toward the student's GPA, but shall be considered in determining eligibility for financial aid and academic probation status. Credit hours earned in developmental co urses are not degree applicable. Grading and the Quality Point System \u2014Within one week of the start of the pertinent semester / term / summer session, the instructor will provide students a written statement of the factors to be considered in determining gr ades and the specific weight to be assigned to each of these factors. The letters A, B, C, D, F, P and X are used by the University to indicate the student's academic proficiency. These letters have the following significance: A\u2014Excellent, valued at four q uality points per semester hour. B\u2014Good, valued at three quality points per semester hour. C\u2014Average, valued at two quality points per semester hour. D\u2014Below average, unsatisfactory, valued at one quality point per semester hour. (A \"D\" gives credit toward a degree. The student's overall grade point average, however, must be a 2.0 or better to meet the requirements for graduation.) F\u2014Failure, valued at no semester hours earned and no quality points. FN\u2014 Failure due to nonattendance, or ceasing to attend, up to and including the 60% point of a term, valued at no semester hours earned and no quality points. Nonattendance shall be defined as failure to perform meaningful academically -related activity includ ing, but not limited to, the following: submitting an academic assignment, taking an exam, participating in an online discussion about academic matters. P\u2014Pass, credit is awarded toward a degree, but no quality points are assigned. The \"P\" designation is r estricted to specific courses approved for its use. X\u2014Incomplete. A grade of \"X\" is given only when a relatively small amount of work is not completed because of illness or other reason satisfactory to the instructor. A grade of \"X \" will automatically beco me an \"F\" unless removed within twelve (12) weeks of the next full term (summer term excluded.) An incomplete must be removed within this twelve -week period regardless of whether the student is registered for additional work in the next term. A student sh ould work with the instructor who assigned the incomplete on an independent basis in order to complete the necessary assignments. A grade of incomplete is not used under any circumstances as a substitute for \"F\" or \"W.\" The designations AU, W, NR, ER and N G are not included in the determination of grade point average and are used in the following cases: AU\u2014Auditor of a course (See \"Auditing of Courses\" for additional information.) W\u2014Officially Withdrew. ACADEMIC INFORMATION 32 Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog NR\u2014No report. Grades for an entire class were not rece ived by the Office of the Registrar in time for processing. The designation \"NR\" is not to be used as a grade for individual students. ER\u2014Error in reporting. This designation is used by the Office of the Registrar when a grade is not reported for an indivi dual student. NG\u2014No grade. A grade is not appropriate to the course. The \"NG\" designation is restricted to specific courses approved for its use. IP\u2014In Progress. The IP designation is restricted to specific courses designed to span more than one term. Unless approved otherwise, an IP designation unresolved at the end of one year after its assignment will be converted to an \"F.\" Transfer work submitted will be equated to our internal scale and denoted as such on your record. Repeating Courses \u2014An undergraduate student is permitted to re peat a maximum of six courses. Only two courses in which a grade of \"C\" or above has been earned may be repeated. Credit for a course in which a grade of \"F\" has been received can be earned only by repeating the cou rse in residence unless prior approval is given by the head of the department in which the course was taken. A course in which a grade of \"D\" has been received may be repeated at another accredited institution. A course that has been failed cannot be repe ated by WKU On Demand (independent learning) without special permis sion from the department head. A student may not repeat by proficiency testing a course that has been previously taken or failed at WKU or another accredited institution. If a course is re peated, the higher of the two grades will be counted in computing the grade point average; if the course is repeated a second time, the two higher grades combined will be used in computing the grade point average. The grade received for each attempt will c ontinue to appear on the student's academic record. A student may attempt a single course no more than three times. WKU does not guarantee the right to repeat any course. Courses may be deactivated, discontinued, or offered on a different schedule. The Com mittee on Credits and Graduation has the responsibility for hearing appeals from students regarding the application of these regulations. An appeal for special permission to repeat a course in the major or minor beyond the third attempt will be considered only upon the recommendation of the head of the department involved, and then only if special consideration is needed to raise the average in that subject to the minimum required. Students seeking special consideration to repeat a course beyond the third attempt in the general education requirements and in free electives must first consult with the University Registrar. If, after this conference, an appeal is deemed appropriate, the Committee on Credits and Graduation will consider the student's request. Transcripts \u2014Transcripts will be released at the written request of the student and in conformity with university policy and existing state and federal statutes pertaining to the release of student academic records. The official academic record is the proper ty of the University. Consequently, the University reserves the right to withhold the release of a transcript of that record if the student has an obligation to the University. Transcript request information is available on the Office of the Registrar webs ite at www.wku.edu/registrar/transcript_request.php . Academic Standing, Probation, and Appeal Academic Standing \u2014To be eligible for continuous enrollment without being placed on academic probation, a student must maintain the following scholastic standards in both the overall grade point average and the total institution grade point average (i.e., courses taken at WKU): A. A 1.7 overall and total institution grade point average if the student has 17 or fewer GPA hours. B. A 1.8 overall and total institution grade point average if the student has more than 1 8 but fewer than 34 GPA hours. C. A 1.9 overall and total institution grade point average if the student has 34 or more but fewer than 51 GPA hours . D. A 2.0 overall and total institution grade point average if the student has 51 or more GPA hours. Note: At the end of each academic term, students may access their grade report via TopNet which reflects grades for the term, the overall grade point av erage, and the total institution grade point average. Academic Warning \u2014 If the previous academic standing was Good Standing (GS), and the student does not satisfy the term GPA requirement but satisfies the WKU GPA requirement and Overall Higher education GPA requirement, the new academic standing is Academic Warning (AW). Students whose academic standing falls to Academic Warning will be asked to attend an Academic Warning Workshop during the first week of classes. In this workshop, students will learn wha t it means to be on Academic Warning, what the implications are for not raising their GPA, and what resources are available on campus to help them succeed in their coursework . ACADEMIC INFORMATION Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 33 Academic Probation \u2014 Students failing to meet the scholastic standards listed above are placed on academic probation. A student on academic probation is allowed continued enrollment on a semester -by-semester probationary status as long as a 2.0 grade point average is maintained each term. The academic probation and dismissal process es for Western Kentucky University are administered by the AARC . The AARC utilizes two of its programs to provide students with resources to reach academic good standing: The Best Expectation Programs (BEP) and The Learning Center (TLC ). Please see Academi c Standing, Probation, and Appeal under the Academic Information section of this catalog for more information . Students on academic probation are required to participate in the Best Expectation Programs (BEP) through the Academic Advising & Retention Cente r (AARC). Academic Dismissal \u2014 Any student placed on academic probation who fails to earn a current (term) grade point average of 2.0 or higher is academically dismissed and is not eligible to enroll in WKU classes for one calendar year. Academic status for all students who complete a term is shown on TopNet. It is the student's responsibility to stay informed of his / her academic status and to improve academic performance until he / she is returned to good standing status. Academic Dismissal Appeal Procedure \u2014 Students who are academically dismissed may file an appeal with Academic Appeal Committee through the AARC . The Academic Dismissal Appeal Committee may dismiss the student from the University or allow the student continued enrol lment under academic probation status with stated restrictions for one additional term. A student dismissed from the University by the Academic Dismissal Appeal Committee may appeal the decision to the Executive Appeals Committee. If the Executive Appeals Committee approves an appeal, the student will be permitted to register for an additional semester on academic p robation with conditions determined by the Executive Committee at the time of approval. Detailed operational procedures followed by the Universi ty Academic Dismissal Appeal Committee may be obtained from the AARC located in the Dero Downing Student Union 2141 . Students who are either dismissed or who voluntarily withdraw due to academic deficiencies are eligible to reapply for readmission after on e calendar year of absence from WKU. Readmission will be determined according to WKU admission standards at the time of application for readmission. Applications for readmission are to be filed with the Office of Admissions by published deadlines. Academic Offenses \u2014The maintenance of academic integrity is of fundamental importance to the University. Thus, it should be clearly understood that acts of plagiarism or any other form of cheating will not be tolerated and that anyone committing such acts risks punishment of a serious nature. A student who believes a faculty member has dealt unfairly with him / her in a course involving academic offenses such as plagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty, may seek relief through the Student Complaint Proc edure. Questions about the complaint procedure should be directed to the Student Ombuds Officer at (270) 745 -6169 or student.ombudsman@wku.edu . Academic Dishonesty \u2014Students who commit any act of academic dis honesty may receive from the instructor a failing grade in that portion of the coursework in which the act is detected, or a failing grade in the course without possibility of withdrawal. The faculty member may also present the case to the Office of Studen t Conduct for disciplinary sanctions . Cheating \u2014No student shall receive or give assistance not authorized by the instructor in taking an examination or in the preparation of an essay, laboratory report, problem assignment, or other project that is submitt ed for purposes of grade determination. Plagiarism \u2014To represent written work taken from another source as one's own is plagiarism. Plagiarism is a serious offense. The academic work of a student must be his / her own. One must give any author credit for source material borrowed from him / her. To lift content directly from a source without giving credit is a flagrant act. To present a borrowed passage without reference to the source after having changed a few words is also plagiarism. Other Types of Academi c Dishonesty \u2014 Other types of academic offenses, such as the theft or sale of tests, should be reported to the Office of Student Conduct at (270) 745 -5429 for further action . http://www.wku.edu/studentconduct/process -for-academic -dishonesty.php. Academic Renewal \u2014 An academic renewal program is available to qualified undergraduate students. Academic renewal prevents the voided coursework from counting toward graduation and the computation of the grade point average; however, the voided coursework will remain a part of the transcript. Qualified undergraduate students must not have attended any accredited college or university for at least two previous years and must have a cumulative grade point average, since readmission, of at least 2.0 (with no grade below \"D\"), computed at the end of the term in which the student completes a minimum of 12 s emester hours of courses numbered 100 or above. WKU accepts transfer credit retained through academic renewal at other institutions but will use grades from those courses for the computation of the overall GPA. The student must file a petition to request a cademic renewal, indicating whether one semester or all previous coursework is to be voided. No student may declare academic renewal more than once. The petition to apply for ACADEMIC INFORMATION 34 Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog academic renewal is available on the Office of the Registrar website at http://www.wku.edu/registrar/documents/form_academic_renewal.pdf . Withdrawal from the University \u2014For various reasons it is occasionally necessary for a student to withdraw from the Un iversity. Prior to the midpoint of the semester, students may use TopNet to withdraw. After the midpoint of the semester, the student should report to the Office of the Registrar to initiate withdrawal procedures. Students leaving the institution without a n official withdrawal will receive failing grades in all courses in which they are enrolled and endanger their future status in the institution. Students withdrawing after the midpoint of the semester, a bi -term or comparable period during a summer session must consult with their instructors as to the withdrawal grade. The official date of the withdrawal is the date the withdrawal is processed on TopNet or the written notice is received in the Office of the Registrar. Students wishing to return to WKU at a later date must submit an application for readmission prior to the deadline for submitting applications. In special circumstances, as described below, a complete withdrawal from the University after the mid -point of a term will be considered. Request form s are available on the Office of the Registrar website at www.wku.edu/registrar/withdrawal.php . Administrative Withdrawal \u2014 A request for an administrative withdrawal is initiated by the University because of a disciplinary situation or when, in the professional judgment of a health care provider, psychologist and/or university administrator, there is reason to believe a studen t is a substantial threat to him/herself or interferes with the welfare of other members of the University, the education process, or the orderly operation of the University. The Vice President for Student Affairs or the Associate Vice President for Academ ic Affairs, or their respective designees, will notify the student of the involuntary withdrawal, and the University Registrar will be directed to withdraw the student from all classes in which the student is currently enrolled and cancel registration that has occurred for any future terms. The Office of the Registrar will notify the student's instructors of the withdrawal, and \"W\" grades will be recorded for the term in progress. A student who is administratively withdrawn will have a registration hold pla ced by the Vice President for Student Affairs or the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs to prevent the student from being readmitted or re -enrolled unless cleared by the appropriate administrator or the respective designee. A student may file a written appeal of an involuntary withdrawal through the office that administered the withdrawal. Tuition refund appeals for administrative withdrawals are handled in a separate procedure, and instructions may be obtained from the Bursar's Office. Medical Withdrawal \u2014 A student may request and be considered for a medical withdrawal from all courses in a term when extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious physical or mental illness or injury, prevent the student from continuing his or her classes after the mid -point of a term, and incompletes or other arrangements with the instructors are not feasible or possible. A medical withdrawal must be substantiated with appropriate documentation from the attending health care provider. Once the rationale for a m edical withdrawal has been validated by the Office of the Registrar, the student's instructors will be sent notification of the withdrawal, and \"W\" grades wil l be recorded for each course. A student who requests a medical withdrawal, or an individual requ esting a withdrawal on behalf of the student who is physically or mentally unable to request the withdrawal, should contact the Office of the Registrar to obtain medical withdrawal procedures. Tuition refund appeals for medical withdrawals are handled in a separate procedure, and instructions may be obtained from the Bursar's Office. Military Withdrawal \u2014 Students who are members of any branch of the United States Armed Services, including the National Guard, who are called to active duty while enrolled at WKU are entitled to the following options. 1. Students may work with each individual instructor to determine if an incomplete grade is appropriate, or 2. If an incomplete grade is not a viable option, the student will be permitted to withdraw either from individual courses or from t he entire schedule of classes. A full refund of tuition and fees will be issued for those courses from which the student has withdrawn. Students who are called to active duty while enrolled should contact the Office of the Registrar to initiate the withdrawal process. An official copy of the military orders must be presented to invoke this special withdrawal and refund process. Retroactive Withdrawal \u2014 A student who leaves the University for extenuating circumstances without an official withdrawal during the term of departure may apply for a retroactive withdrawal. The student must present supporting documentation that demonstrates serious and compelling reasons justifying the withdrawal and extenuating circumstances justifying i ts retroactive nature; poor academic performance that is not attributed to non -academic extenuating circumstances is not a consideration for retroactive withdrawal. A student may appeal for a retroactive withdrawal within two calendar years following the e nd of the term for which withdrawal is requested. A student need not be enrolled at WKU at the time the application for retroactive withdrawal is submitted. ACADEMIC INFORMATION Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 35 An appellate board will review the reques t for a retroactive withdrawal. The board will consider the following factors, including, but not limited to: 1. Documentation of extenuating circumstances 2. Written letter of support from an academic administrator, faculty member, advisor or other university professional who is familiar with the student's situation. If a retroactive withdrawal is approved, the Office of the Registrar will notify the student's instructors and department heads of the request for a retroactive withdrawal, and they will be given 14 calendar days to raise objections if the stude nt's classroom performance was such that a withdrawal (W) would n ot be appropriate. If objections are raised by the instructor or department head, the Office of the Registrar will be informed of the objection, and the student will not receive a \"W\" in the class. A tuition refund is not grante d for a retroactive withdrawal. Student Complaint Procedure \u2014 The student complaint procedure for resolving a complaint concerning a faculty member is outlined below in four steps. Step 1 (Faculty Member) The first step is for the student to discuss the complaint with the faculty member involved. If the faculty member is no longer employed by the University, the student should go directly to the department head who will contact and represent the former faculty member. If the complaint involves a grade, the student must take the complaint to the faculty member within the first two weeks of the first regular semester (fall; spring) following the assignment of the grade. It is hoped that the complaint may be satisfactorily d ealt with at this level. Step 2 (Department Level) If the student and the faculty member are unable to resolve the complaint, the student may take the complaint to the faculty member's department head. Written notification of the complaint must be given to the department head within two weeks after the meeting with the faculty member. It is the responsibility of the department head to arrange for a conference where the student, faculty member and the department head will be present for discussion. Neither t he faculty member nor the student will be allowed representation at the conference. The department head shall hear both sides of the complaint and shall attempt to mediate a settlement. The department head shall keep a written record of the proceedings, in cluding the recommended solution. The department head's recommended solution is to be considered by both the faculty member and the student as a recommendation and not as a decision that is binding. Step 3 (College Level) Should the student be unable to re ceive the satisfaction desired at the departmental level, the complaint may be taken to the college level. Written notification of the complaint must be submitted to the college dean or his designated representative within two weeks after the conference wi th the department head (Step 2). Upon receipt of the notification, the college dean or his/her representative shall provide the student a copy of the procedural guidelines to be followed by the College Complaint Committee. The procedural guidelines shall provide for a conference with both the student and the faculty member present for joint discussion of the complaint with the committee. The College Complaint Committee will be responsible for scheduling the conference within two weeks following the submissi on of a written complaint to the chair of the College Complaint Committee, including as much detail as the student cares to include. The written complaint should clearly state what is considered to be unreasonable and/or unfair practices or procedures. Nei ther the faculty member nor the student will be allowed representation at the conference. The College Complaint Committee shall hear both sides of the complaint and render a decision. The decision shall be sent in writing to the Provost and Vice -President for Academic Affairs, with a copy being sent as a matter of record to the student, faculty member, faculty member's department head and the faculty member's college dean. The Office of the Provost and Vice -President for Academic Affairs shall be responsibl e for enforcing the decision of the college committee. The Office of the Provost and Vice-President for Academic Affairs shall not enforce the decision until two weeks after the decision is made by the college committee. The purpose of the two week delay i s to provide either the student or the faculty member an opportunity to submit a formal written notice of appeal to the University Complaint Committee. Step 4 (University Level) Should the student or the faculty member desire to appeal the decision of the College Complaint Committee, a formal written notice of appeal may be submitted to the University Complaint Committee chair, with a copy to the Provost and Vice -President for Academic Affairs, within two weeks of the decision of the College Complaint Commi ttee. The chair of the University Complaint Committee will provide the student and the faculty member involved with a copy of the University Complaint Committee's Procedural Guidelines. The University Complaint Committee will secure copies of the written p roceedings from the department head and the College Complaint Committee. The University Complaint Committee will schedule a conference where the faculty member and the student jointly discuss the issue. Neither the faculty member nor the student will be al lowed ACADEMIC INFORMATION 36 Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog representation at the conference. The committee's decision will be sent to the Provost and Vice -President for Academic Affairs, with a copy being sent as a matter of record to the student, faculty member, faculty member's department head and the facu lty member's college dean. The Office of the Provost and Vice - President for Academic Affairs will see that decisions of the University Complaint Committee are carried out.

A student may take a departmental comprehensive proficiency assessment in any course listed as satisfying a requirement in any of the categories of general education. Departments may offer departmental comprehensive proficiency assessments in other cours es at their discretion. To assess student proficiency, a department may adopt either a standardized examination available from outside the University or develop an appropriate comprehensive proficiency examination within the department by means of a facult y committee. Departmental comprehensive proficiency assessments may be written, oral or both. To be eligible to take a departmental comprehensive proficiency assessment , a student must be fully matriculated, in good standing, and regularly enrolled at WKU. Credits earned in this manner will be recorded on the student's official transcript as non -residence credit but will not be considered as a part of the normal semester load in the term in which the examination is taken. A student may not register for a de partmental comprehensive proficiency assessment for a course while he or she is enrolled in that course. A student may not take a departmental comprehensive proficiency assessment in a course which has been previously taken at WKU or at another accredited institution. A student desiring to take a departmental comprehensive proficiency assessment must complete an appropriate request form in the Office of the Registrar. A fee of $25 per credit hour must be paid at the time the form is submitted. The form must be submitted to the Registrar prior to the end of the third week of classes in either the fall or spring semesters. The Registrar will notify the appropriate department of the student's request. The department will administer the comprehensive proficiency assessment during the seventh week of classes. The student must obtain the specific time and place for testing from the department head. ACADEMIC INFORMATION Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 53 After the assessment has been completed, the department head will notify the Registrar in writing as to whether or not the student demonstrated acceptable proficiency. If the department recommends credit be granted, the semester hours earned will be recorded on the official transcript. However, the credit will not be used in computing the grade point average since letter grades will not be assigned. Military Service Credit WKU strives to be a military friendly institution that will provide military personnel the ability to attend WKU and receive college credit for formal courses and primary occupations offered while in the military. WKU awards college credit based on the Ame rican Council on Education (ACE) Guide recommendation, and the credit will count as non - residence credit. Active duty soldiers or military veterans are required to submit official military transcripts prior to admission. Any soldier who is retired or disch arged from the military will be required to submit their official military transcripts and a copy of the DD form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty of Service) member copy 4. The DD 214 must have characterization of service listed on the form. The DD 214 Form may be requested at http://www.archives.gov/veterans/military -service -records/ . Official military transcripts may be requested at https://jst.doded.mil/. Prior Learning Assessment Students who h ave acquired extensive college-level knowl edge and skills in academic areas including but not limit ed to employment, milit ary experience, civic activities, volunt eer service, organizational training or workshops, or other non-tradition al means m ay be granted credit for the knowl edge and skills they have gained through nationally standardized exams (AP, CLEP, IB, ACE, etc.), departmental assessments , or portfolio d evelopm ent and evaluation. This poli cy focuses on po rtfolio d evelopm ent and evaluation, while referencing national and departmental assessments when appropriate. Prior learning by portfolio evaluation is consid ered an oppo rtunity for students to d emonst rate their knowl edge and is not a guarantee of credit for experience. Students will compl ete a portfolio of their prior learning as a part of a portfolio d evelopm ent course, IDST 250, t aught by an inst ructor who h as undergone training by the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL). Please note : the three credits earned in IDST 250 will count toward residence, while the prior learning credit awarded will be treated as nonresidence credit. The portfolio, with v arying forms of documents, will tie content learning outcomes to the knowl edge and skills students h ave acquired through experiential learning. Credit earned will d epend upon the student's ability to produce a portfolio th at communi cates learning outcomes consist ent with the WKU mission on the level expected for the credit sou ght. Before registering for this course, stud ents will consult with the instructor to evaluate the feasibility of seeking credit in a particular area. The student will id entify a maximum of two content areas for which credit is being sought, and his or her portfolio will be submitt ed to two full-time WKU faculty members, at least one from each area for which the student is seeking credit, upon su ccessful compl etion of the course. These faculty experts will review the portfolio and determine if and how mu ch academic credit is to be granted, as well as whether the credit should be given for a specific course, or for non- course-specific credit. The consensus recomm endation of the reviewers must be approved by the department head(s) and dean(s) of the college(s) concerned, and th en will be forwarded to the Office of the Registrar to transcript recomm ended credit. The portfolio development course, IDST 250, may be repeated for a maximum of three credits. The total number of Prior Learning credits applied toward a WKU credential cannot exceed a quarter of the total hours in the credential. For additional information, please contact: Adult Learner Services at (270) 745-3575 or visit www.wku.edu/pla . Transfer of Credits Undergraduate Transfer Policies Students transferring to WKU are required, as a part of the admission process, to provide the Office of Admissions with official transcripts from all previously attended institutions. Credits earned at other accredited American institutions of higher educ ation may be transferred to WKU and applied toward a degree. The \"Transfer Credit Practices\" report published by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers will be the reference used for the evaluation of such credits. Stude nts who previously earned course credit from a non -regionally accredited institution may petition for recognition of that credit. Consideration will be given to courses whose content suggests competencies at least equivalent to courses offered by WKU. For more information see: http://www.wku.edu/admissions/transfer/transfercredit.php . Courses completed at a baccalaureate degree granting institution will be accepted for transfer credit at the level of the equivalent WKU course. Courses completed at a community or junior college will transfer to WKU as lower division credit only, even if WKU offers a comparable course at the upper division. ACADEMIC INFORMATION 54 Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog Acceptance of transfer credits for a particular major, minor or certificate is subject to approval by the appropriate academic department. WKU accepts transfer grades, and those grades will be recorded onto the WKU transcript and computed into the student's overall GPA. Transfer work submitted will be equated to our internal scale and denoted as such on your record. Some academic departments require a minimum grade of \"C\" in each course applicable toward a major. Refer to the departmental descriptions in this catalog or contact the department head to de termine the specific requirements for each major. Credit for a course in which a failing grade has been received can be earned only by repeating the course in residence unless prior written approval is granted by the head of the department in which the course is offered. When a transcript from an accredited institution records credit granted for educational experiences; such as, credit by exam, advanced placement, prior learning credit, dual credit high school work, the credit will generally be accepted in transfer, except for developmental coursework, which WKU does not accept for degree credit. The student's academic department will decide how and whether the credit applies to degree requirements for a particular major, minor, or certificate. WKU supports the CPE policy w hich outlines acceptable AP and CLEP scores; for the complete policy see: http://cpe.ky.gov/policies/ , of WKU AP/CLEP http://www.wku.edu/registrar/documents/form_creditbyexam.pdf . Graduation honors (e.g., cum laude ) are based upon students earning a minimum of 45 hours in residence for baccalaureate degrees and a minimum of 27 hours in residence for associate degrees. The minimum residence requirement for the baccalaureate degree and associate degree is 25% of the minimum number of semester hours required in the student's degree program must be earned through instruction at WKU . At least one -third of the hours in the major and minor must be earned at WKU. Kentucky General Education Transfer Policy The Kentucky General Education Transfer Policy (2012) provides guidelines for the transfer of general education coursework between Kentucky public postsecondary insti tutions. The policy guarantees that if a student completes an associate (AA or AS) degree or some general education coursework at a KCTCS college, any Kentucky public university will accept their general education credits as meeting lower -division general education requirements. The transfer of general education credits is predicated on the acquisition of competencies in broad academic areas, rather than a comparison of individual courses taken at one institutions or another. The five broad categories are : 1) Arts and Humanities (AH), 2) Communications: Written Communication (WC) and Oral Communication (OC), 3) Natural Sciences: (NS), plus Science Lab (SL), 4) Quantitative Reasoning (QR), and 5) Social and Behavioral Sciences (SB). The sending institution will indicate, either on the transcript or as an attachment to the transcript, whether the student is Fully Certified, Core Certified, or Category Certified in general education, or if they have completed any of the coded general education courses (i.e., A H, NS, OC, QR, SB, SL, and WC) at their institution. Fully Certified - All general education requirements are completed (AA and AS degrees guarantee full certification). Core Certified - The 30 hours of core general education is completed, and remaining general education requirements of the receiving institution are still required. Category Certified - One or more of the above categories is complete (e.g., AH Category Certified is interpreted as no additional courses are required in the AH category). Course Certified - The category is not complete, but a course in that category applies to that category. Questions pertaining to the Kentucky General Education Transfer Policy should be di rected to the Transfer Center, 2135 Downing Student Union, (270) 745 -2177 or email Transfer@wku.edu . The full CPE General Education Transfer policy can be viewed: http://cpe.ky.gov/policies. General Education Transfer Policy from States other than Kentucky Students who complete an associate degree containing 30 unduplicated semester credit hours of General Education (typically an Associate of Arts [AA] or an Associa te of Science [AS] from a regionally accredited institution outside Kentucky are considered to have fulfilled all WKU Colonnade General Education requirements. These credit hours are to be drawn from and include at least one course from each of the followi ng areas: humanities/fine arts, social/behavioral sciences, and natural science/mathematics. General Education Transfer Policy for Institutions That Close Students who complete all General Education requirements containing 30 unduplicated semester credit hours toward a Bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution that is closing or has closed are considered to have fulfilled all WKU Colonnade G eneral Education requirements. These credit hours are to be drawn from and include at ACADEMIC INFORMATION Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 55 least one course from each of the following area: humanities /fine arts, social/behavioral sciences, and natural science/mathematics. Transfer Student Services Upon admis sion and receipt of all transcripts, the student's transfer credit will be recorded into the university's student information system and will be available online at www.topnet.wku.edu and in iCAP, WKU's automated d egree audit system . Students and academic advisors may view course articulation (or equivalency) on iCAP prior to the student's participation in the Topper Orientation Program . The iCAP report serves as official assignment of credits to WKU Colonnade Gener al Education Requirements; however, acceptance of transfer credits for a particular major, minor or certificate is subject to approval by the appropriate academic department. Students may petition WKU departments to determine if a course should be equivale nt to a WKU course. The petition form may be obtained online at http://www.wku.edu/transfer/transfer_petition.pdf . Transfer Academic Plans To assist associate degree recipients in understanding the courses needed to complete a baccalaureate degree at WKU, a variety of Transfer Academic Pathway Plans have been established. A list of the specific degree programs and pathway plans are available at http://www.wku.edu/academicaffairs/pd/transfer_students.php . In addition, there are statewide transfer plans on the KnowHow2Transfer site: www.knowhow2transfer.org/ Formal Articulation Agreements Formal articulation agreements are mutually beneficial partnerships with colleges and universities developed to match coursework between institutions to help students make a smooth transition from other institutions. These agreements specify how transfer c redit will be applied toward general education or other degree requirements. WKU's formal articulation agreements are available at: http://www.wku.edu/academicaffairs/pd/articulation.ph p. International Transfer Credit Transfer credit from foreign educational institutions may be granted after a determination of the type of institution involved, its recognition by the educational authorities of the foreign country, and an evaluation of the content and level of the courses. Extensive use is made of professional references which describe the educational systems and programs of individual countries. Students who have attended an educational institution located outside of the United States will need to request all schools attended to send the official transcript(s) directly to Western Kentucky University. Some educational institutions do not issue transcripts to other schools; instead they issue transcripts or the original certificate / mark sheet to students. In this case, students must make a photocopy of the original transcript / certificate / mark sheet and have the school attended (or a certified translation service firm) certify / attest that the photocopy is a true copy of the original doc ument. Consulates and embassies often serve as a resource for the attestation of educational documents. Students on WKU's campus may bring the original transcript(s) or document(s) to the International Admissions O ffice for review and verification. For more information, contact iem@wku.edu . WKU Students who Study Abroad Transfer credit is awarded upon receipt of an official transcript from an international institution, only if the study abroad experience was pre -approved by the Office of Study Abroad and Global Learning. Transfer credit will be converted to semester hours, and all cours es and grades are transferred. Additional information is available at http://www.wku.edu/studyabroad/new/academy_credit.php . WKU Students who Enroll Elsewhere WKU students occasionally enroll in courses at other institutions, usually during the summer term or through the \"Study Away\" program. Prior to such enrollment, students should access the online transfer equivalency guide available through the Transfer Cen ter website (see View Transfer Credit Equivalencies on: http://www.wku.edu/transfer/transferhow.php .) This site provides the exact equivalency by course between institutions, if the course has bee n articulated. Approval for credits to be applied to WKU Colonnade General Education Requirements is provided by the Coordinator of Transfer Articulation, Transfer Center, and will appear on TopNet and the iCAP reports. Approval for transfer courses to be applied to a major, minor, or other programs should be obtained from the appropriate academic department. Questions pertaining to transfer policies, services or procedures should be directed to the Transfer Center, 2135 Downi ng Student Union, (270) 745 post the question(s) electronically: http://www.wku.edu/admissions/forms/inforequest.php .

Williams The programs and coursework of the Department of Folk Studies and Anthropology have the goal of providing WKU students and the University constituency with the training, intellectual tools, and resources to understand the cultural and biological dimensions of humankind in terms of the myriad shaping factors addressed in our respective discip lines. Although the disciplines of anthropology and folk studies are distinct, they share the University's POTTER COLLEGE OF AR TS & LETTERS Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 83 commitment to excellence in teaching, research, and public service, recognizing that this mission continues to evolve in response to regional, nation al, and global change. Both undergraduate and graduate programs in folk studies stress the examination of traditional expressive culture as a key to understanding human experience. The discipline of folklore has close affinities with literature, anthropolo gy, sociology, history, geography, linguistics, philosophy, ethnomusicology, and psychology. The folk studies program integrates humanistic and social scientific perspectives on culture with pragmatic skills needed for professional involvement in research or for a variety of fields of employment such as public and applied folklore, historic preservation, cultural resource management and museum work. In response to the growing importance of cross -cultural studies, the department offers an undergraduate minor in folklore in order to provide students with opportunities to enrich their general knowledge of the folk traditions and customs of specific societies and culture areas and to develop greater understanding of related forms of human thought and expression. The anthropology program at Western Kentucky University offers students a coherent program of study that enriches their knowledge of human culture, develops their cross -disciplinary perspectives, and prepares them for a variety of careers. In particular, the program provides opportunities for students to study the interaction of culture and biology, both in contemporary societies as well as in the archaeological and evolutionary past. The curriculum prepares students for graduate studies and employment in cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, archaeology, linguistic anthropology, or cultural resource management. Anthropology enriches the study of history, religion, languages, biological and physical sciences, and other social sciences. The anthrop ology program maintains extensive archaeological, biological, and cultural collections at the Anthropology Laboratory. The anthropology program also houses a state -of-the-art Ethnographic Video Production lab with digital cameras and editing stations.

It provides perspective and knowledge which helps us understand the present and it provides hope that we may avoid past mistakes. As the broadest of all academic disciplines, history appeals to the curious mind which is not content only with understanding the present. History equips students with the skills to collect, analyze, and use data and the ability to apply those skills to construct arguments and use evidence to support them. Because of its breadth, the study of history prepares students for numerous occupations and professions. Many of our majors pursue careers in education from the elementary through college level. There are, however, a variety of other areas open to the student of his tory: local, state, and federal government, the Foreign Service, law, professional library work, the nation al park service, banking, journalism, politics, and a host of others.

The Department of History offers a variety of courses to students in any major , as wel l as courses meeting Colonnade r equirements for all students.

B oth the American Bar Association and the American Association of Law Schools recommend a broad liberal arts program of courses for potential law students. Pre -law students will best prepare for law school by pursuing a rigorous course of study during their undergraduate years. No specific major is required for admission to law school, but students should select major and minor fields which they find both interesting and promising for superior academic performance. Admission to law school is on a competitiv e basis, and the number of openings at each school is limited. The main criteria for admission to most recognized schools are a high grade point average (GPA) in undergraduate work and a high score on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). A Bachelor of Art s or Bachelor of Science degree from an accredited four -year college or university is required for admission to law schools accredited by the American Bar Association. Law school admission directors and independent studies of the factors which contribute t o success in the study of law conclude that undergraduates should develop a core group of skills during their programs of study. It is important that students select courses that develop strong vocabulary and reading comprehension skills, effective writing ability, analytical/logical reasoning, and an understanding of societal institutions and values. Students should pursue a challenging course of study that emphasizes reading, writing, and analytical ability. Courses which can develop the requisite skills and abilities for legal study include: ENG 100, ENG 200, ENG 300, ENG 301, and English electives; PS 110, PS 220, PS 326, PS 327, and PS 328; HIST 101, HIST 102, HIST 445, HIST 446, and history electives; PHIL 215, PHIL 350, PHIL 415 and philosophy electives. Based on individual interests, students may also pursue elective courses in a ccounting, econom ics, sociology / criminology , foreign language, and speech communication. The following courses, while not mandatory for pre -legal study, offer undergraduate students a useful introduction to various aspects of public law and legal history: PS 326, PS 327, and PS 328; HIST 445 200; Please note: Recommended courses are based on WKU's assessment of specific pro fessional school requirements. Students should, in consultation with their advisor, review the requir ements at the professional school of their choice. Each student who intends to study law after graduation should make initial contact with the Pre -Law Advising program. Afterwards, students are encouraged to meet with a pre -law advisor in addition to his/h er major advisor during their tenure at WKU. Pre -law advisors will provide assistance in obtaining information about law schools, the Law School Admission Test and other pertinent information. Aspiring pre -law students should plan to take the LSAT POTTER COLLEGE OF AR TS & LETTERS 88 Western Kentucky University | 2017 -2018 Undergraduate Catalog in June following their junior year. During the senior year, the pre -law advisor will also be available to assist students in the preparation and submission of applications to law schools of their choice. Applications are usually accompanied by letters of recommen dation from faculty members who can comment on the student's ability and promise for the study of law. Aspiring candidates should conduct their undergraduate studies that they can , with confidence , ask at least three faculty members to serve as references.

Martin The Department of Music promotes the study and experience of music in its broadest sense: preparing artist teachers and performers, enhancing creativity and the human spirit, and enriching the quality of life on campus, in the region, and in our global community. Western Kentucky University has be en a fully accredited member of the National Association of Schools of Music since 1948. A large part of the department's mission is the preparation of music teachers and professional musicians. Students with broad musical interests may select a music majo r or minor within a diversified liberal arts program. Music degree programs provide for the development of basic musicianship through conceptual understanding of musical properties and their interrelationships, relevant opportunities for listening, perform ing, composing, and scholarship, and the acquisition of a repertory representative of various cultures and historical periods. Competencies in various areas and at varying levels appropriate to each program of music concentration are developed through a se quence of studies and assessments. General University students may elect certain music courses through the Colonnade Program Requirements . All students from all disciplines may participate in various instrumental and choral ensembles. Students wishing to pursue a music degree (including double majors) should have pre -college training in their principal or major performing instrument or voice and be able to read music fluently. Basic keyboard ability is helpful but not mandatory. Enterin g students must audition for admission to the music program to major or minor in music , including diagnostic examinations in theory rudiments (scales, keys, intervals, triads, general notation), music reading, and performance (principal instrument/voice). Deficiencies may be removed through remedial placement except in the case of auditions for the Bachelor of Music in Performance. When planning a program of study in this department, each student should be aware of the University's academic requirements an d regulations contained in this catalog in the chapter \"Academic Information.\" Pay particular attention to the subsections entitled (a) Academic Programs, (b) Colonnade Requirements , and (c) Academic Requirements and Regulations.

Department of Philosophy and Religion Dr. Jeffrey Samuels , Interim Head Email : Jeffrey.Samuels@wku.edu Cherry Hall , Office 300 Phone: (270) Snyder Associate Professors: A. Anton, P. Fischer, Assistant Professors: S. Arjana, J. Barker, G. Hunt , B. Lennertz Retiree : C. Pinnick , J. Trafton Professors Emeriti: A. Anderson, M. Curtis, J. Long, E. Schoen, D. Tuck, R. Veenker , A. Vos Philosophy The mission of the philosophy program is to use its faculty's collective expertise and experience in the various philosophical disciplines to teach philosophy with the intention of enabling its students to become effective, self - critical leaders able to em power others, to solve problems in diverse social and professional settings, and to experience satisfactions that can only come from living the examined life. To serve this mission, the philosophy program is committed to providing courses that: foster eth ical understanding, analytical reading, logical thinking , and clear expression in our students; illuminate the assumptions, methods , and foundations of other disciplines for students who also major or minor in philosophy; acquaint students with paradigms and perspectives from past philosophies that provide recurring thought patterns whose strengths and weaknesses an autonomous individual should know; prepare students to deal with problems for which there are neither simple nor obvious solutions; equip s tudents for graduate and professional study in fields such as law, government service, management, medicine, the ministry, and philosophy. The philosophy program is to aid students to draw out from within themselves the assumptions and beliefs \u2014 often unconsciously but nonetheless deeply felt and held \u2014 governing their thoughts and actions, to express these inner convictions fully and clearly, and to subject them to critical analysis. This is the birth into the examined life. It is also the first step t oward awakening in the students the spirit of critical inquiry, encouraging them to question readily accepted ideas, to probe for and to expose all assumptions, and to subject all claims and all issues \u2014personal or public, local or international \u2014 to close examination. Philosophy lays bare fundamental questions and instructs students in the methods for grappling with them. As students develop, they see how ideas drive the phenomena of daily life. Philosophy calls students to the responsibility of putting all ideas to the test to know their value. Religious Studies The mission of the religious studies program is to promote the academic study of religion at Western Kentucky University and in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. POTTER COLLEGE OF AR TS & LETTERS Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 107 The academic study of religion provides the student with the methodological orientation necessary to comprehend the central beliefs, ethical practices, ritual systems, symbols, and social institutions of diverse religious traditions in their historic, thei r contemporary and their global contexts. Study in this field is multicultural and comparative, examining the life, ways, and moral worlds of societies past and present, our own as well as others. The student learns to probe for the structure, function and meaning of religion through those rites of passage, sacred narratives, faith communities, and codes of behavior that give meaning to human existence. The department offers a major and a minor in philosophy and a major and a minor in religious studies. Th ese majors prepare students for graduate work in philosophy and religious studies. Majors and minors in these fields also contribute to preparation for a variety of professional and vocational fields. In each case, the number of semester hours required is modest in order to encourage second majors and minors. The requirements are flexible enough to permit students to select courses which develop and extend their interest. Asian Religions and Cultures The continent of Asia is home to some of the most ancient and formative civilizations in history. All of the world's largest religious traditions have their origins on the continent, and Asian peoples have shaped and reshaped how humanity understands the world and it self for centuries. The Asian Religions and C ultures major facilitates the understanding of the continent and its peoples, allowing students to understand not only the Asian past but to put current issues and problems into a broader historical, religious, and cultural context.

Students with lower than a 2.5 grade point average that includes 12 hours of upper -division business courses will be allowed to take only those upper -division courses in the G ordon Ford College of Business they are repeating. Repeating a course will not be considered to violate the enrollment policy restricting upper -division courses to 12 hours prior to admission. All students desiring to major in accounting must complete the following courses: ACCOUNTING: ACCT 2 00, ACCT 312, ACCT 430, ACCT 450, ACCT 499, and six hours of accounting electives from the following list: MGT 220, MGT 314, FIN 330 and MGT 498. Three hours of professional or accounting electives should be selected from: COMM 345, ENG 306, and all upp er-division courses offered in the Gordon Ford College of Business except ACCT 330, BA 490, CIS 369, ECON 490, ENT 490 , FIN 449, MGT 490, and MKT 490. Any students seeking to enroll in ACCT 300 must have completed ACCT 200 with a grade of \"B\" or better. A student seeking to enroll in ACCT 301 and/or ACCT 310 must have completed ACCT 200 and ACCT 201 with grades of \"B\" or better. Except for ACCT 300 , ACCT 301, and ACCT 310, students must be admitt ed to the Accounting Program to enroll in upper -level accounting courses. Accounting majors must earn a grade of \"C\" or better in ACCT 300, ACCT 301, ACCT 303, ACCT 310, and ACCT 312 and other courses when used as prerequisites for succeeding courses.

In addition, accounting majors are allowed to repeat an upper -division accounting course only once, even if they received a \"W\" on the first attempt. Exceptions to this policy will be considered only in extenuating circumstances. All students must take two accounting electives and one approved accounting or business elective. Pursuing a Second Degree in Accounting Individuals who have already received a college degree have the opportunity of enrolling in WKU to pursue a degree in accounting. Students with a first degree in the area of business should be able to complete the Bachelor of Science degree in accounting with approximately 30 additional hours. Those individuals without previous courses in business tend to need a higher number of hours to complete the second degree. Admission requires the completion of certain pre -professional courses and the attainment of a grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.5 in those courses. Second baccalaureate degree candidates are exempt from the Western Kentucky University Colonnade requirements. Accounting students must, however, complete the math requirement and an approved speech course, either in previous colleg e work or as a part of the proposed course of study. Only those accounting and professional business courses completed within five years of the time that the student enrolls for the second degree in accounting will be accepted. The business environment is ever changing and coursework taken many years ago likely has either been forgotten or is not currently relevant . The decision on acceptability of any previously taken professional business course on the second degree rests with the Chair of Accounting. The prospective candidate for the degree should contact the Chair of Accounting to schedule a meeting to evaluate the individual's situation, to develop a program of study, and to obtain an estimate of the time necessary to complete the Accounting degree. Accounting JUMP Program The Accounting Joint Undergraduate and Master Program (JUMP) allows students to take both undergraduate and GORDON FORD COLLEGE OF BUSINESS Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 129 graduate courses concurrently.

S. Leguizamon, S. Locke , C. Biolsi Professors Emeriti: B. Davis, C. Roberts Transitional Retirees: D. Myers, R. Pulsinelli Mission Statement The primary mission of the economics program is to offer educational opportunities to students in order to prepare them to become accomplished citizens and professionals capable of critical thinking and independent analysis. The economics faculty places an emphasis on excellence in teaching and continuous professional development in applied, instructional and basic research. The department also r ecognizes the importance of conducting professionally relevant service activities for the university, the public, and private constituents at the local, state and national levels. Economics is an integral part of a well -rounded liberal arts education becau se the study of economics provides an antecedent to ethical judgments, to the assessment of the full range of both past and present public policies, and to an understanding of other economies and cultures. Economics is a versatile, multifaceted subject that includes global dimensions that are of increasing importance in today's diverse society. The program also recognizes the importance of economic science in the preparation of a wide variety of professionals including those in business, law, journalism, ba nking, government, and academia. The faculty acknowledges the importance of communication and technical skills in the development of well -rounded students. Economics courses require the application of the appropriate verbal and writing skills that are cruc ial complements to analytical skills. The economics curriculum and course offerings are designed to highlight and illustrate the practical importance of a knowledge of economics in understanding today's local, national and global issues. Economics Economic s is a discipline concerned with how society chooses to allocate scarce resources among alternative uses in order to produce and distribute private and public goods. The programs and course offerings are designed to provide a basic understanding of economic concepts, institutions, processes, and problems; to foster critical and analytical methods of thinking; and to lay the foundation for further study of economics. The economics department offers three program options: AB in Economics, BS in Busines s Economics, and BS in Mathematical Economics. The AB in Economics (reference number 638) provides a variety of courses and programs to fit students' needs and interests. Students combine their work in economics with study in other fields such as business, communication, and computer science. Many other combinations are also available. These options allow a high degree of flexibility in choosing alternative areas of study. The BS in Business Economics (reference number 7 24) is a major in specialized busines s economics. The business economics major combines courses in economics with those in accounting, finance, information systems, management, marketing, and quantitative business analysis. This unique array of courses provides the student with both the gener al and specific skill s desired by employers. GORDON FORD COLLEGE OF BUSINESS 130 Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog The BS in Mathematical Economics (reference number 731) is designed for students wishing to pursue a graduate degree in economics, a highly applied, analytical occupation or a career as an actuary. The general track in the BS in Mathematical Economics strongly recommended for students considering e ither a PhD in Economics or highly applied, analytical occupations. Students should note that economic doctoral pro grams are highly mathematical. An alternative path would be a math minor in conjunction with either the AB in Economics or the BS in Business Economics . A WKU minor in mathematics (reference number 417) requires a minimum of 17 semester hours. To obtain a math minor, the student must ta ke the foundational sequence (MATH 136, MATH 137, MATH 307). The student is also required to select two additional math classes. The two classes that would best prepare a student for graduate studies in economics are MATH 237 and MATH 331. The actuarial science track in the BS in Mathemat ical Economics is strongly recommended for students pursuing careers as actuaries. Actuaries use a combination of strong analytical skills, business knowledge and an understanding of human behavior to manage risk. To beco me an actuary, you must pass a series of exams to earn actuarial designation by either the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) or the Society of Actuaries (SOA). With the track in actuarial science as part of a mathematical economics major, you will take cour ses that provide you the best chance of success on the first two actuarial exams. In addition, you can apply to receive Validation by Educational Experience (VEE) credit from either the CAS or SOA in the areas of Applied Statistics, Economics, and Corporat e Finance, obtained through approved course sequences. Each year, the economics program awards the C. Keith Davis Memorial , N.O. Taff, Kenneth T. & Maria Cann and Steve and Donna Lile Scholarships. The recipients must be in one of the majors offered by th e Economics Department and selection is made on the b asis of academic performance. Faculty also select a junior and a graduating senior economics, business economics, or mathematical economics major whose outstanding performances merit their selection as t he Outstanding Junior and Outstanding Senior in Economics. Additionally, economics majors participate in the \"Best Papers in Economics\" competition for annual awards.

Marketing Mission Statement \"To offer high quality undergraduate and graduate education for our varied constituencies.\" Our goal is to graduate students with the knowledge and skills necessary for success and leadership in the business community. To accomplish this mission, we will use progressive teaching techniques as well as seek and apply knowledge through research. We also provide service to the university and the community using our expertise. Ultimately, we insure that students are prepared to excel in an ever changing, increasingly competitive, glob al environment by engaging them in the classroom and the business community.

This allows a student to develop an education program which most closely fits their career aspirations and increases their placement opportunities. Marketing is a people -oriented, dynamic business function that leads to goal -oriented exchanges between individuals and organizations. Important marketing activities include developing an idea, good or service intended to satisfy consumer wants and needs, promoting / advertising it to likely customers, selling it at a mutually agreeabl e price, and distributing it in acceptable locations. GORDON FORD COLLEGE OF BUSINESS Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 141 The objectives of the marketing program are to teach students (1) the importance of marketing in an economy characterized by free consumer choice, (2) the knowledge and skills required to perform marke ting activities, and (3) the interaction between marketing and diverse environmental forces which impact marketing decisions.

Entry -level business positions serve as a step into professional selling and sales force management, pricing, product or brand management, social media marketing, advertising, market research, physical distribution, retail management an d merchandising, sports and event marketing or purchasing. Marketing also provides a solid foundation for those who hope to own their own business in the future. Careers in marketing often lead to high -level management positions. Non -business and not -for-profit organizations (hospitals, educational institutions and charitable groups) also seek well -trained marketing graduates. When planning a program of study in this department, each student should be aware of the University's academic requirements and re gulations contained in this catalog in the chapter \"Academic Information.\" Specific attention should be given to the subsections in the chapter entitled (a) Academic Programs, (b) Colonnade Requirements, and (c) Academic Requirements and Regulations.

Ogden College is located on the campus of an earlier ed ucation al institution established in Bowling Green in 1877 as a provision in the will of Major Robert W. Ogden. The original Ogden College closed, and its properties were leased to WKU in 1928. The name Ogden reappeared when the Ogden College of Science an d Technology was established within Western Kentucky University in 196 5. Students and faculty at WKU have benefited from its membership in Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU). ORAU is a consortium of 114 colleges and universities and a contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. ORAU works with its member institutions to help their students and faculty gain access to federal research facilities throughout the country; to keep its members informed about opportuni ties for fellowships, scholarships, and research appointments; and to organize research alliances among it s members. Programs cover a wide variety of disciplines including earth sciences, epidemiology, engineering, physics, geological sciences, pharmacolog y, ocean sciences, biomedical sciences, nuclear chemistry, and mathematics. Many of these programs are especially designed to increase the numbers of underrepresented minority students pursuing degrees in science and engineering related disciplines. For m ore information about ORAU and its programs, contact: Dr. Cathleen Webb , Associate Dean of OCSE and the ORAU counselor for WKU. Ogden College is home to the Health Professions Advisement Center (HPAC). WKU has an outstanding track record of students gaining entry to the health professions. At HPAC, students interested in attending a school or college of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, optometry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic medicine, podiatry or physician assistant, will receive information, advice and guidance on their preparati on for admission to professional school. In collaboration with the College of Education, Ogden College offers the SKyTeach Program for those interested in teaching science and math at middle or high school levels.

Netthisinghe The complexity of the technological and financial structure of modern agriculture has made education increasingly important. It has also brought about a need for personnel to fill positions in various businesses and professions which support agriculture. Processing and marketin g of agricultural products and supplying of agricultural chemicals, machinery, seed, feed and other products require research, sales and service personnel who have met specific educational requirements. OGDEN COLLEGE OF SCI ENCE AND ENGINEERING Western Kentucky University | 2017 -2018 Undergraduate Catalog 161 Governmental agencies which conduct research, extensi on, advisory and regulatory activities are staffed by highly trained agricultural personnel. The Department of Agriculture strives to fill the needs of both the student who requires general technical knowledge for production agriculture and the student who needs more specialized training to pursue one of many careers. This is accomplished by offering specific curricula with enough flexibility to allow specialization within the curriculum. Many students studying agriculture have urban backgrounds and lack fa rm experiences. The Department of Agriculture uses the University Farm and the Agricultural Exposition Center as integral parts of its laboratory and classroom instructional program to provide practical experiences. Internships and cooperative work experie nces are encouraged for all students. To complete the 12 0 semester hours required for a Bachelor of Science degree in agriculture, students must complete the basic curriculum and one of the concentrations .

Dobrokhotov, E. Kintzel, I. Novikov, W. Van der Meer Department of Biology: K. Crawford, S. Jacobshagen Department of Chemistry: K. Williams Biophysics studies the physics of life processes and explores the application of physics to biology and medicine. It combines a working knowledge of physic s theory with an appreciation of the complexities of biological processes. Although only recently established as a separate discipline, it has rapidly taken position alongside those fields that are advancing the frontiers of scientific knowledge. The minor in biophysics serves students of the life sciences: agriculture, biology, environmental engineering, environmental health, medical technology, pre -dentistry, pre -medicine, pre -optometry, pre -pharmacy, pre -veterinary medicine and psychological sci ence . Goals of the Biophysics minor: The purpose of the biophysics minor is to prepare students to meet the career goals listed below. It is expected that a student completing this minor will be proficient in the use of biological and medical instrument ation and will understand the underlying physical theory that make it work . In addition, the student will be exposed to two fundamental ways of looking at biology; first, from the point of view of the biologist who understands the complexity of life processes and second, from the point of view of the physicist who appreciates the basic simplicity of all the laws of nature. Career Opportunities: The applicability of biophysics is so widespread that we can only outline some of the career opportunities. Medical d octors, dentists, pharmacists, optometrists, veterinarians, many researchers in the life sciences, physical therapists and nurses require an understanding of the principles and techniques involved in the use of modern instruments. Radiation treatment, medi cal imaging , genetic engineering, nanodevices, laminar flow rooms, cryosurgery and artificial organs have all been made possible due to rapid advances in biophysics. Biophysics provides a helpful background for students interested in professional training in health related fields. It is also a valuable area for students interested in teaching biology or health at any level. Industrial, government or university laboratory work requires a thorough knowledge of both the theory and application of modern instrum entation. The federal government is currently funding training programs that combine biology and physics. Job opportunities are available for students with such a background and these openings are expected to increase over the next few decades.

Students participate in and lead discussions on various aspects of the broad topic, and select specific issues on which to base analytical writing projects. Honors Augmented Credit \u2014Students enrolled in non -Honors upper -division courses may develop a contract with the faculty member, academic department, and Mahurin Honors College to receive Honors credit. This allows students to more fully pursue subjects of particular interest or importance to their career goals. Honors Capstone Experience/Thesis \u2014The Honors Capstone Experie nce/Thesis (CE/T) is a sustained original research or creative activity in a student's major or minor discipline. The nature and form of the CE/T is open, to be determined based on the interests and background of the student and CE/T advisor. Past CE/T pro jects have included library and laboratory research projects, short story and poetry collections, computer programs, and original musical compositions. Upon completion, the title of the CE/T appears on the student's official transcript. Honors Self -Design ed Studies \u2014The Honors self -designed studies major and minor permit Honors students with specific goals or interdisciplinary interests to design unique programs of study when WKU's existing programs do not adequately fit the student's needs. The self-design ed major requires at least 48 hours when used as a major that does not require a 2nd major or minor, 36 hours when used as a first major, and 30 hours when used as a second major; the area study minor requires 24 hours. Honors Priority Registration \u2014Returning Honors students in good standing may enroll during the Priority Registration period . Honors students must attend an Honors Advising appointment each academic year to be eligible for priority registration. Priority registration allows students gre ater flexibility and choice in planning their schedule. Incoming students register as part of the Topper Orientation Program (TOP ) process. Honors Housing \u2014Honors students may choose to live (space permitting) in an Honors co -educational residence hall. A request for Honors housing must be indicated on a student 's housing application. Honors Development Grants \u2014Students may apply to the Mahurin Honors College for grants to defray costs associated with Honors Capstone Experience / Thesis or other undergraduate research, or to permit travel that will advance their career training or educational experience. Grants may be used to defer costs associated with attendance at professional meetings. Travel Abroad Grants \u2014Students may apply to the Mahurin Honors College for grants to defray costs associated with study abroad programs. Funding is determined partially by the length of the program.

OIP provides opportunities for faculty, staff, and students to incorporate global perspectives into all aspects of aca demic life. Mission: The Office of International Programs at Western Kentucky University will provide leadership in the development of a strong international profile that is recognized both nationally and globally for its excellence. The office will advoc ate for the strengthening of the international dimensions of the curriculum; development of innovative ways to provide globally educative experiences both at home and abroad; development of active and sustainable international agreements; pursuit of innova tive grants; and the creation of community partnerships that center on quality of life issues and economic development for the community, region, and state. The office will support the internationalization agenda of all university departments by providing high-quality student, scholar, and faculty support services. In all of our work we will be guided by the core values of professionalism and ethical behavior. OIP develops and coordinates programming and events that foster WK U's international aspirations. OIP sponsors the International Year Of... program, a unique, annual initiative designed to internationalize the WKU campus and surrounding community through a yearlong exploration of a single world region or country. For the International Year Of... (IYO) program , OIP partners with academic and non -academic units to create opportunities for students, faculty, staff and the larger community to engage with and explore a country's diverse cultural, historical, political, and geographical landscapes \u2014all withou t a passport .

Study Abroad & Global Learning Mr. Gordon Johnson , Interim Chief International Officer HCIC Building Phone: (270) 745 -5334 Email: study.abroad@wku.edu Website: www.wku.edu/studyabroad / The Office of Study Abroad & Global Learning (SAGL) serves the WKU community by engaging students, faculty, and staff in diverse educational and cultural experiences through faculty -led, exchange, consortia, and other study abroad opportunities. Study abroad programs at WKU offer students the opportunity to incorporate international academic, professional, and cross -cultural experiences into their education. WKU offers a wide variety of international education opportunities for a range of academic disciplines and budget needs. Students can choose to study, intern, volunteer, student teach, or conduct research a broad during any academic term. Students who wish to study abroad should start planning early in their academic career to ensure the most affordable and academically enriching experience. When planning a study abroad experience, each student should be aware of the university's academic r equirements and regulations contained in this catalog in the chapter \"Academic Information.\" It is recommended that students work closely with their academic departments and the SAGL office to carefully select a program that meets their academic needs, ful filling specific degree requirements through courses offered on the program. SPECIAL PROGRAMS & D IVISIONS 360 Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog WKU students who participate in a study abroad program may choose to earn an \"Emphasis in Global Studies\" designation, which can be combined with any major, as part of their under graduate education. For details regarding the requirements, refer to the section about \"Global Studies Designation\" in this catalog or on the SAGL website. Types of Study Abroad Programs WKU students wishing to study in another country have a variety of o ptions from which to choose. These options can be divided into five major categories: short -term faculty -led programs, international student teaching, exchange programs, WKU partner programs, and provider programs. More detailed information on all study ab road options can be found on the SAGL website, but a brief overview of each type of program follows. WKU Faculty Led Study Abroad Programs Many WKU students who study abroad do so by taking a course in another country on a program personally led by a WKU f aculty member. These courses are typically 1 -7 weeks in length and carry 3 -6 credit hours, and they generally occur during the winter or summer terms. WKU International Student Teaching Education majors at WKU have the opportunity to spend the final month of their student teaching semester in another country, teaching classes in English at a partner school. This cross -cultural teaching experience fosters global awareness and helps prepare future teachers for working with diverse student populations. WKU Exc hange Programs WKU has formal agreements with more than a dozen institutions of higher education outside the United States . Exchange programs are typically for a semester or an academic year, and they offer students the opportunity to become fully integrat ed into a foreign university. Shorter -term opportunities exist with some exchange partners. Students are often surprised to learn that studying abroad for a semester on an exchange program costs the same tuition as a semester at WKU at the in -state tuition rate. WKU Partner Programs WKU has close partnerships with several programs and study abroad consortia including Harlaxton College, Semester at Sea, the Kentucky Institute for International Studies (KIIS), and the Cooperative Center for Study Abroad (CCSA). The two on -campus consortia partners (KIIS and CCSA) offer affordable program options for which students receive WKU cre dit. Several of the courses offered on WKU partner programs are taught by WKU faculty members. Provider Programs WKU has affiliation agreements with a variety of study abroad program providers which offer a plethora of short -term, semester, and academic y ear programs in numerous countries around the world. Students who are unable to find a program that meets their academic needs through faculty -led, international student teaching, exchange programs, or WKU partner programs can certainly find good options t hrough affiliate providers. Financing Study Abroad Scholarships and financial aid are available for most study abroad programs . Even the most expensive program can be affordable when students use all of the resources available to them. Students who are eli gible for financial aid and/or are receiving scholarships can typically use those awards towards the cost of a study abroad program. The Office of Study Abroad and Global Learning, the Student Financial Assistance Office, and the Office of Scholar Develop ment can help students plan financially for this important investment in their college education. WKU has created several significant study abroad scholarships to support WKU students who pursue international opportunities. These scholarships include the World Topper Scholarship and the Diversity Abroad Grant (DAG) . While the World Topper Scholarship is intended to support any WKU student planning to study abroad, the DAG is intended to provide significant financial support for diverse students. For more i nformation about these and other scholarship opportunities available through WKU and external organizations , visit the SAGL webpage (www.wku.edu/studyabroad ). Safety & Code of Conduct The safety of our students is of paramount importance. Students are provided with information pertaining to insurance requirements, emergency procedures, and health and safety abroad during the pre -departure process , both in writing through SAGL's online application and enr ollment tracking system , and in person at the mandatory pre -departure orientation session. Additional on -site orientation is provided upon arrival in the destination country. Students are also required to register with the U.S. State Department's Smart Tra veler Enrollment Program (STEP) prior to departure, which enables the State Department to reach students directly when security -related information is issued or updated. While abroad, WKU students are held to the standards set forth in the univer sity's Stu dent Code of Conduct. The Office of Student Conduct will be notified of any alleged violations of the Student Code of Conduct that occur during an education abroad experience.

A citizen's rights and liberties under the Constitution must always be applied in light of the special characteristics of the environment in which the rights are to be exercised. Central to the special characteristics of the environment of a state support ed university campus is the special authority of University officials designated by the Board of Regents to control, preserve, and manage University property and affairs and to maintain order and discipline. Therefore, the WKU Student Code of Conduct was e stablished to ensure that disruptions to the University community are handled in an education al, fair, and dignified manner. The University expects students, parents, and the greater community to respect its rules and procedures governing the WKU community and will resist any unwarranted attempts to influence University policies and procedures. The University demands high standards of personal conduct and encourages each student to maintain int egrity through self -discipline. The University adopts rules and regulations that are necessary for the orderly, harmonious, and beneficial functioning of the University community. Accordingly, each student must respect the rights of others and should abide by the spirit as well as the letter of regulations of the Unive rsity and laws of the community, state, and nation. Any question of interpretation regarding the WKU Student Code of Conduct shall be referred to The Office of Student Conduct . The WKU Student Code of Conduct shall be reviewed every two years under the dir ection of the Director of Student Conduct . Maintenance of Student Records The Office of Student Conduct maintains disciplinary records on students of Western Kentucky University. All student records maintained by the Office of Student Conduct are held in compliance with the Family Educational R ights and Privacy Act (FERPA). These records are kept under lock and in confidence in said office with access to these records being available only to the ap propriate University officials. Non-Current re cords, more than five years old, shall be destroyed or expunged. Current disciplinary records which are pending or resulted in a suspension or expulsion shall be retained. Purpose of the Student Code of Conduct Western Kentucky University developed a Stude nt Code of Conduct in order to fulfill its mission and promote a positive environment for all membe rs of the University community. As a member of the University community, a student is granted rights and responsibilities, which are defined within the Stude nt Handbook. It is the responsibility of every student to become familiar with the WKU Student Code of Conduct and the rights an d responsibilities of students. Ignorance of the WKU Student Code of Conduct is not acceptable justification for violation of an y campus policies or procedures. The regulations within the Student Code of Conduct are intended to govern the student conduct at Western Kentucky University. The University will take disciplinary action against a student for an off -campus offense only whe n the nature of the offense is such that, in the judgment of the Director of Student Conduct , the continued presence of the student on campus is likely to interfere with the educational process and the orderly operation of the University. Students who viol ate the law may incur penalties prescribed by civil and criminal authorities. However, the University reserves the right to review student incidents independent of action by civil and criminal authorities and apply the University 's disciplinary process as it serves the educational mission of WKU, a function separate and distinct from civil and criminal proceedings.

Process for Academic Offenses Dishonesty Such as cheating, plagiarism, misrepresenting oneself or an organization, knowingly furnishing false information to the University, or omitting relevant or necessary information to gain a benefit, to injure, or to defraud is prohibited. Academic Integrity The maintenance of academic in tegrity is of fundamental importance to the University. Thus it should be clearly understood that acts of plagiarism or any other form of cheating will not be tolerated and that anyone committing such acts risks punishment of a serious nature. Academic Dis honesty \u2014Students who commit any act of academic dishonesty may receive from the instructor a failing grade in that portion of the course work in which the act is de tected or a failing grade in a course without possibility of withdrawal. The faculty member may also present the case to the Office o f Student Conduct for disciplinary sanctions. A student who believes a faculty member has dealt unfairly with him/her in a course involving academic dishonesty may seek relief through the Student Complaint Procedure . Plagiarism \u2014To represent written work taken from another source as one's own is plagiarism. Plagiarism is a serious offense. The academic work of a student must be his/her own. One must give any author credit for source material borrowed from him/her. To lift content directly from a source without giving credit is a flagrant act. To present a borrowed passage without reference to the source after having changed a few words is also plagiarism. Cheating \u2014No student shall receive or give assistance not authori zed by the instructor in taking an examination or in the preparation of an essay, laboratory report, problem assignment, or other project which is submitted for purposes of grade determination. Other Type s of Academic Dishonesty \u2014Other types of academic offenses, such as the theft or sale of tests, electronic transmission of test, test sharing, etc. wil l be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for disciplinary outcome . What if a student plagiarizes or in some other way is academically dishonest? The Faculty Syllabus or Handbook may permit a faculty member to fail a student on the assignment or the entire STUDENT CONDUCT POLI CIES Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 375 class. Cases of academic dishonesty may be referred to The Office of Student Conduct for review and additional action. It isn't obligatory for fa culty to contact the student that they have referred to the Office of Student Conduct to start conduct proceedings. If a student appeals the outcome of the conduct proceedings, the Vice President of Student Affairs of his/her designee will review the appea l. If the violation could result in removing the student from the University (the typical term is 1 year), then the University Disciplinary Committee meets with the student in a conference setting. This committee will hear the more serious academic dishone sty cases. Off-Campus Jurisdiction While the institution does not desire to act as a policing authority for the activities of the student off University property, and while it cannot serve as a sentencing authority for a student's violation of federal, st ate or local law, the University may take appropriate action in situations involving misconduct that violates the WKU Student Code of Conduct. The university has a vested interest in student behavior as it pertains to alcohol use and other drug use which threatens the health, welfare and safety of self and others. The university has deemed off -campus violations of the alcohol and drug code of conduct to be actionable by the university disciplinary process. When actions or incidents occur outside of the residence halls or off campus, such conduct may call into question the student's continued membership in the educational community either because the s tudent grossly violated elementary standards of behavior required for the maintenance of the educational community or because the student's continued presence would adversely affect the pursuit of educational goals of others. It is also the position of the Office of Student Conduct that among the violations of misconduct considered to be of an especially serious nature are those that represent a threat to the safety and health of members of the University Community. These include involvement with narcotics, dangerous drugs, and/or controlled substances, violence or threat of violence, non -consensual sexual contact, and the possession of firearms or the brandishing of any object in threatening manner. A student found in possession of a firearm or any other we apon or the brandishing of any object in a menacing or threatening manner will be referred to the Director of Student Conduct for the sole purpose of determining either suspension or expulsion. Notwithstanding the above, the President of the University is authorized and has empowered the Vice President for Student Affairs and the Director of Student Conduct to suspend (interim suspension) any student if it is indicated that under the circumstances the accused student's continued presence on campus during th e three day interim period awaiting a conference before the University Disciplinary Committee is inimical to the best interests of the University. Any such suspension (interim suspension) shall be for a period of not more than five days. The student shall be furnished written notice of the actions and the reasons therefore. The notice shall also advise the student that the accusation of misconduct shall be referred to the University Disciplinary Committee. Procedures Followed: Student Conduct Conference Flo wchart Notification of student code violation Notification by letter, or phone to s tudent regarding code violation Staff member to schedule an appointment with student Meet with Director of Student Conduct to discuss alleged student code violations Implement outcome or case dismissal Follow -up letter of outcome and actions taken Student to Complete Outcome File record of incident and outcome In enforcing student conduct regulations, the University follows fair procedures in keeping with democratic practices and due process requirements. Action will not be taken without providing the student with notice of the charges in STUDENT CONDUCT POLI CIES 376 Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog advance to allow a reas onable period of t ime to prepare for the conference. Preliminary conferences with the student on any alleged violation or misconduct may occur immediately for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and extent of the problem. Because the focus is on the edu cation of students, conferences are conducted as informal inquiries and do not follow formalized courtroom procedures. Decisions at such conferences will be based solely upon the information produced therein. Based on the preponderance of the evidence, the level of student responsibility and/or involvement shall be determined by the institution. In any case where the violation of University policy involves conduct that would constitute a public criminal offense upon prosecution and conviction, the burden will be satisfied by either: (a) The accused student's admission of responsibility to the committee, or (b) Information in the record, if the student denies responsibility that a preponderance of evid ence indicates responsibility. A university committee for student disciplinary matters has been established by action of the Board of Regents of Western Kentucky University in accordance with the Kentucky Revised Statutes which authorize the Board of Regents to invest the faculty/staff or a committee of the faculty/staff with the power to suspend or expel any student for egregious violations of the WKU Student Code of Conduct or a gross disregard for the rights of o thers in the campus community. Therefore, this Committee will consider all cases involving outcome of suspension or expulsion . The Committee is comprised of thirteen members, six faculty, five staff, and two students, who are appointed by the President of the University. Faculty terms are three years and are staggered so that the term of one third o f the membership expires each year. At least seven members of the Committee will be present before any official action is taken. Any decision will be made by a majority of th ose Committee members present. The Committee is to be notified of a meeting by the Office of Student Conduct immediately upon determination of the necessity for such a meeting. Committee meetings are conducted in two parts. In the first part, only information that bears on whether or not the student has engaged in specified violations o r misconduct may be presented. If the Committee finds no violation or misconduct, the finding is recorded and the proceeding is concluded. If the finding is that the student has, in fact, engaged in a violation or misconduct, the Committee shall, in the se cond part of the proceeding, hear and consider any information bearing upon circumstances of extenuation or mitigation. After this part is concluded, the Committee shall determine the appropriate outcome. The Committee will function in accordance with the following procedures: Preliminary Procedures 1. Director of Student Conduct or his/her designee shall have notified the student or students in writing as to the time and place of the conference to be held by the university committee for student disciplinary matters and of the nature of the problem or charge and the information ag ainst the student or students. 2. Notification to the student (s) shall be made at least three days before the conference is to be held. The student will meet the Director of Student Conduct or his/her designee to discuss the conference process and sign a ju dicial conference checklist form. In the student's absence, a written report of the facts of the case and all related documents will be presented and reviewed by the University Disciplinary Committee and a decision will be made as to whether or not a viol ation of misconduct occurred and an appropriate outcome will be levied at that time. 3. The Director of Student Conduct and other persons on the staff shall provide the committee with a written report of the facts of the case. 4. If so desired, the student(s) ma y be accompanied at the conference by a member of the faculty, staff, fellow student or any third party approved by the University. Written approval must be secured two wor king days prior to the conference. 5. Persons accompanying the student may advise but not represent and may not address the Committee in any fashion without permission from the Chairperson. 6. Due to the delicate nature of the conference and because of the need to protect confidential records and the alleged victim, these meetings shall be oth erwise closed. Conference Procedures 1. The Chairperson will begin the meeting by citing reasons for the call. Information bearing on whether or not a violation or misconduct has occurred will be given by the Director of Student Conduct or an appointed repre sentative of the Director of Student Conduct . STUDENT CONDUCT POLI CIES Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 377 2. The student will be given an opportunity to state the case and to present pertinent information for defense. 3. The Chairperson will call for discussion in a question and answer exchange on whether or not a viola tion or misconduct has occurred. 4. The Committee will make a decision in an executive session on whether or not a violation or misconduct has occurred. 5. The decision of the Committee will be reported to the student and the student's representative in a private session. If the decision is that a violation or misconduct has occurred, the Committee will then hear and consider information bearing upon the circ umstances of extenuation or mitigation. 6. The Committee will then apply the appropriate outcome in closed session. If the Committee finds that a violation or misconduct did not occur, the Committee will state as such and the meeting will conclude . 7. A recor d of the session proceedings will be retained by the University. Conditions for Appeal The University understands the need to have a corrective process in place to address ci rcumstances should the Conduct Officer. One or all of the follow conditions must be met in order for an appeal to be considered. An appeal should be set forth by the accused: 1. To determine whether the original conference was conducted fairly and in accordance with the Office of Student Conduc t sanction determination and procedures. 2. To determine whether the decision reached regarding the accused student was based on substantial information to determine the preponderance of evidence and/ or the level of responsibility. This is not information you chose not to share or obtain prior to the conference. 3. To determine whether any sanctions imposed (suspension, expulsion or denial of housing/network access) were appropriate and not unduly harsh for the violation(s) set forth in the Student Code o f Conduct. 4. If you are the complaining student in a sexual harassment and/or sexual misconduct case. For sexual misconduct and/or sexual harassment cases both the complainant and the charged student can file an appeal regardless of the outcome. Both stu dents have the same grounds to appeal and the same time frame in which to submit an appeal. *An appeal cannot be filed simply because you are unhappy with the decision. *If one of the aforementioned conditions is proven, the appeal will be forwarded to the appropriate reviewer. A student who files an appeal must do so in writing to the appropriate reviewer: 1. Students who wish to appeal the conference outcome of the Residence Life Staff must submit a written appeal to the Assistant Director of Residence Life within five business days following the decision. 2.

If the Vice President for Student Affairs , or his/her designee, upholds the outcome of suspension, expulsion or separation, an appeal may be made to the President of the University. In the event the President considers the outcome to be inconsistent with the ethical principles and standard of conduct of the University community, the President may request that the case be reopened and reheard by the University Disciplinary Committee. If the President upholds the conference outcome of suspension or expulsion, an appeal may be made to the Board of Regents. The decision of the Board of Regents is final. *If none of the three conditions for appeal is met, the decision of the original conference will be upheld and the responsible student is expected to comply immediately. Procedures for Appeal through the President to the Board of Regents 1.

Applications from the student for full Board en banc review are not entertained. Appropriate written notice to that effect shall be furnished the student at the time the student receives a copy of the Committee's determination, which shall constitute the final decisio n. Policies and Procedures for Dealing with Students Displaying Behavior Due to Emotional Disturbance Demonstration of Physical Harm - Any student who demonstrates intent to seriously harm himself/herself or otherwise poses a danger causing psychological or physical harm to self will be referred to the Chair of the Campus Partners Team or his/her designee for referral to the Counseling and Testing Center. The intent of the following policies and procedures is to support an appropriate living and learning e nvironment at Western Kentucky University for faculty, staff, and students. Incidents of disruptive behavior brought on by emotional disturbances will be assessed and treated with care for their effects upon the student displaying the behavior and the total University community. Western Kentucky University recognizes the fact that emergencies may arise due to what appears to be a student displaying disruptive behavior due to emotional disturbances. Such emergencies may create a threat to the student or others, and must be evaluated by c ompetent medical professionals. When emergencies of this nature occur, they are reported to the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs or his/her designee and The Office of Student Conduct . Demonstration of psychol ogical or physical harm, or disruptive behavior caused by manifestations of a serious psychological problem include, but are not limited to: STUDENT CONDUCT POLI CIES Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 379 - instances where a student engages in, or threatens to engage in, inappropriate behavior that poses a danger of causing physical harm to self or others, or inappropriate behavior that demonstrates a student's inability to care for self, and/or - instances of inappropriate behavior that would cause significant property damage, or would directly and substantially imped e the lawful activities of others, or that substantially interferes with or impedes the educational experiences of others, or would interfere with the educational process and the orderly operation of the University; and/or - instances where a student enga ges in inappropriate behavior where a contributing factor is failure to follow a prescribed medical or psychological treatment plan; and/or - instances of inappropriate behavior that causes a chronic, inordinate use of university resources including, but not limited to, staff time, psychological services, medical services, and/or emergency services, thereby resulting in an undue burden to the University. When it has been reported or it is determined by the Vice President for Student Affairs or his/her desi gnee that a student has allegedly participated in one or more of these behaviors, the student will be required to present himself or herself within one business day, to the Director of Counseling and Testing or his/her designee. If the circumstances indica te that an evaluation is in the best interest of the student and the University, the Vice President for Student Affairs or his/her designee or the Director of Student Conduct shall coordinate this evaluation with the Director of Counseling Services. Based on the request made by the Vice President for Student Affairs or his/her designee , the student may be admitted to one of the local hospitals for treatment. The Counseling Di rector will coordinate with the hospital for future treatment. After consultation with the Counseling Director and the review of past behavior of the student, the Vice President for Student Affairs or his/her designee will determine if withdrawal procedure s should be initiated if the student present s a danger to others. The purpose of these procedures would be to remove the student from campus housing and/or from the University for the care of the student and the University. The student will be notified in writing by the Vice President for Student Affairs or his/her designee to appear for a meeting. The Office of Student Conduct is responsible for the University disciplinary process. This policy does not preclude a student's removal from the University, or a ny unit, class, or program, for disciplinary reasons in accordance with WKU's Student Code of Conduct. The Office of Student Conduct or the Vice President for Student Affairs or his/her designee and the Counseling and Testing Service and Health Services, w ith appropriate releases, may consult to determine whether a student accused of violating the University's Student Code of Conduct should be diverted from the disciplinary process to these procedures. Conversely, these departments, with appropriate release s, may consult to determine whether a student referred for consideration for a medical withdrawal might be more appropriately handled through the student disciplinary process. A student who is withdrawn from the university, under the provisions of this pol icy, has the opportunity for one appeal. Medical Withdrawal should not be imposed when disciplinary , academic, or other responses are readily available and the student's situation can be addressed through those avenues. Furthermore, when possible and appropriate, efforts will be made to persuade the student to voluntarily withdraw and to follow a course of treatment needed to resume student status. Forced medical withdrawals are reserved for students who present a danger to others A. Behavioral Evaluat ion Requirements When a student's behavior is sufficiently disruptive due to emotional disturbances to cause University staff members to question whether or not the student can benefit from the educational programs at WKU, or if the student poses a potenti al danger to himself/herself or others, the Univers ity will require an evaluation. The evaluation will be conducted by the Counseling and Testing Center or an appropriate professional outside the University who shall serve in an advis ory capacity to the Un iversity. When necessary, the cost of this required evaluation shall be the responsibility of the University. Should a student desire a second evaluation or an evaluation by a professional of his/her choice other than that provided by the University, then the student shall bear the cost of the evaluation. A student choosing to leave the University prior to receiving the evaluation will be withdrawn from the University under the Universit y policy governing withdrawals. In accordance with the University Stude nt Record Policy, the VPSA or his/her designee, may inform the student's parents, spouse, or some other member of the family regarding concerns of the student's safety or the safety of others. Should the student choose not to meet for an evaluation, a conf erence of appropriate staff shall be convened to determi ne what action should be taken. If a dependent student refuses an evaluation, his/her parents or immediate family may be informed, when appropriate, of the refusal to meet wit h the appropriate profess ional. When appropriate and on a \"need to know\" basis, certain University officials and staff, such as residence hall staff, the student's STUDENT CONDUCT POLI CIES 380 Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog academic dean, or other University personnel, shall be notified of the concern about the student and the student's refusal to withdraw or to be evaluated by an appropriate person. In the event that the student complies with the request for evaluation, then one of six actions will follow based upon the results of the evaluation: 1. The student will remain enrolled at the U niversity with no treatment; 2. The student will remain enrolled at the University with treatment and be allowed to remain in on -campus living; 3. The student will remain enrolled at the University with treatment but not be allowed to live in a residence h all or other University owned or controlled property; and/or he or she may be restricted from other areas of campus as appropriate; 4. The student may withdraw from the University voluntarily; 5. Administrative withdrawal; or 6. Medical withdrawal B. Enrollment Options I. Remaining Enrolled at the University with no Treatment Based upon the results of the evaluation and solely at the discretion of the University, the student may be allowed to remain enrolled at th e University with no treatment. Any behavior problems will be corrected by the student immediately. A period of time may be designated during which the student's behavior is under review by the Office of Student Conduct . II. Remaining Enrolled at the University with Treatment and Remain ing in On -Campus Living Based upon the results of the evaluation, the University has the right to require the student to meet certain conditions of treatment. The cost of any treatment (such as counseling/therapy) required of the student shall be the student's/parents' responsibility. A Behavioral Agreement or a probation period may be established with the student. Solely at the discretion of the University, a student may have his or her behavior under review for a period of ti me while undergoing treatment . The University will require that any behavior problem be corrected and/or terminated and/or that corrective medical or therapeutic action be taken. III. Remaining Enrolled at the University with a Facilities Restriction At times, the students who remain enrolled at the University and in treatment may be required to leave University residence hall and/or be restricted from usi ng other University facilities. Requiring a student to leave the environment of a university residence hall and to live at home or i n a more appropriate place while seeking treatment and, (in some cases, carrying reduced course loads) as a commut ing student may be appropriate. Furthermore, the behavior of the student may be sufficiently disturbed and disturbing in a residence hall envi ronment to make it essential that the family or others assume responsibility for the student's care; yet, the student's classroom behavior is sufficiently controlled and that he/she can be permitted to continue clas s work at a reduced load level. The stude nt's behavior will be under review by the Office of Student Conduct during this time to insure appropriate conduct. The intention of this policy is to provide another option for the student so that the student can receive treatment and still maintain an appropriate level of coursework. If the student agrees to engage in counseling as required and to leave the University residence hall voluntarily, the Director of Housing and Residence Life, or his/her designee, is informed and will implement the with drawal from the residence hall. If the student is required to engage in counseling and/or to leave the residence hall and is unwilling to do so, the VPSA or his/her designee will implement involuntary withdrawal from the residence hall or the University as provided in the Administrative Withdrawal section. IV. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University for Disruptive Emotional Health Reasons A voluntary withdrawal is defined as one in which the recommendation to withdraw a student for disruptive behavior related to emotional disturbance has been made by the Director of Counseling and Testing or his/her designee, or an off-campus evaluator, and the student concurs with the withdrawal recommendation. The professional staff is concerned with attempting to insure c ontinued therapeutic help for the student outside the University community; therefore, the student's parents, spouse, or some other member of the family may be informed of the withdrawal and the need for arrangements for additional therapeutic care. STUDENT CONDUCT POLI CIES Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog 381 Normally, the VPSA or his/her designee will reach a decision about withdrawal in discussions with the st udent and the student's family. The decision is then conveyed to the Office of Student Conduct to authorize preparation of the University withdrawal for m. V. Administrative Withdrawal A request for an administrative withdrawal is initiated by the university because of a disciplinary situation or when, in the professional judgment of a health care provider, psychologist and/or university administrator, the re is reason to believe a student is a substantial threat to him/herself or interferes with the welfare of other members of the university, the education process, or the orderly operation of the university. The Vice President for Student Affairs or his / her designee , or the Vice President for Academic Affairs, or their respective designees, will notify the student of the involuntary withdrawal, and the Registrar will be directed to withdraw the student from all classes in which the student is currently en rolled and cancel registration that has occurred for any future terms. The Office of the Registrar will notify the student's instructors of the withdrawal, and \"W\" grades will be recorded for the term in progress. A student who is administratively withdra wn will have a registration hold placed by the Office of Student Conduct or the Vice President for Academic Affairs to prevent the student from being readmitted or re -enrolled unless cleared by the appropriate administrator or the respective designee. A st udent may file a written appeal of an involuntary withdrawal through the office that administered the withdrawal. Tuition refund appeals for administrative withdrawals are handled in a separate procedure, and instructions may be obtained from the Bursar's Office. VI. Medical Withdrawal A student may request and be considered for a medical withdrawal from all courses in a term when extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious physical or mental illness or injury, prevent the student from continuing his or her classes after the midpoint of a term, and incompletes or other arrangements with the instructors are not feasible or possible. A medical withdrawal must be substantiated with appropriate documentation from the attending health care provider. Once the r ationale for a medical withdrawal has been validated by the Office of the Registrar, the student's instructors will be sent notification of the withdrawal, and \"W\" grades will be recorded for each course. A student who requests a medical withdrawal, or an individual requesting a withdrawal on behalf of the student who is physically or mentally unable to request the withdrawal, should contact the Office of the Registrar to obtain medical withdrawal procedures. Tuition refund appeals for medical withdrawals are handled in a separate procedure, and instructions may be obtained from the Bursar's Office. C. Emergency Removal of a Student from the University Exceptional situations may occur in which a student is judged to be out of contact with reality and unaware of the consequences of his/her actions, or where the student is potentially harmful to himself/herself or others at that time. Action to remove the student from the university is taken by one of the following: VPSA, the Director of Student Conduct , Housing and Residence Life staff, University Counseling and Testing Center staff, or Health Services staff, in cooperation with the student's family if pos sible. Hospitalization may be required. Involving the student in these actions may not be possible because of the nature and degree of the student's illness. These situations are considered emergencies and one of the following offices will coordinate the e fforts of the University: the Vice President for Student Affairs, the Office of Housing and Residence Life, the University Counseling and Testing Center, Health Services, outside medical or psychiatric resources. The VPSA will be involved in special emerg ency procedures and is immediately notified of the actions taken. As emergency situations, these cases fall outside the procedures stated above for voluntary withdrawals except that the student will be informed in writing of the rationale for the withdraw al recommendation and of his/her right to present any pertinent information in rebuttal to the withdrawal recommendation for consideration by the aforementioned. Sexual Misconduct/Harassment: Title IX Compliance The Office of Student Conduct ensures compli ance with all Title IX requirements. The following can be expected for all cases/investigations that are designated as a Title IX incident: The Office of Student Conduct will provide a timely and thorough investigation, and will treat the complainant and respondent with respect before, during, and after the student conduct process. Barring exigent circumstances, cases of sexual misconduct or sexual harassment shall be resolved within a 60 day period once the incident has been reported. Once a decision has been rendered by either a student conduct officer or a University Disciplinary Committee, all of the involved parties will be informed of the decision in writing. STUDENT CONDUCT POLI CIES 382 Western Kentucky University | 201 7-2018 Undergraduate Catalog All involved parties have five business days to appeal the decision rendered by either the student conduct officer or a University Disciplinary Committee. If any involved party appeals, all other parties will be informed and will have the opportunity to review the appeal materials. The other involved parties, if they choose to do so, can submit a statement of response within 5 business days of receiving notice of the appeal. WKU reserves the right to take whatever measures it deems necessary to respond to an allegation of sexual misconduct/violence in order to protect student's rights and perso nal safety. Measures include, but are not limited to, modification of living arrangements, interim suspension, and reporting to university police. Sanctions imposed range from Disciplinary Agreement to Expulsion, depending on the severity of the offense. The Office will consider the concerns and rights of both the complainant and respondent of sexual misconduct.
