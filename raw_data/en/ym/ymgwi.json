In addition to social distancing and masking up to avoid possible exposure to the virus, there has been a frenzy of detox cleanses and stocking up on herbal remedies in attempt to boost immune system function. However, not all natural remedies are considered equal. Being able to identify the top preventative measures you can take from a trusted source is crucial to optimizing your health in a safe and effective manner. Let's delve into these preventative tools to protect your immune health before infection strikes. 1. Bioresonance Therapy When our systems are bogged down with toxins, our body cannot operate optimally. This leaves us continually trying to fight off those toxins while trying to maintain other key functions in the body. Over time, system imbalances develop, and our ability to properly fight off infection becomes impaired. Toxins such as parasites, fungus, mold, bacteria, virus and more can resonate within our cells and wreak havoc on our immune system. Worst yet, they can block our body's own detoxification pathways, inhibiting that process and lengthening the amount of time those toxins resonate with us. Add a poor diet in the mix, say sugar, alcohol and/or gluten, and now the body is fighting inflammation on top of toxins. [Bioresonance Therapy](https://ariaintegrativehealth.com/bioresonance-therapy/), also known as bioenergetic medicine, is a holistic diagnostic tool used to identify and resolve imbalances throughout the body. It is specialized at identifying toxins and other system stressors in the body, and developing customized remedies tailored to the patient's specific needs to detoxify the body safely and efficiently and clear congested pathways that may impair your immune system. 2. Barlow LDM Once a virus enters the body, it releases an enzyme called 3CL (3-chymotrypsin-like protease). This enzyme attacks the cells' defense mechanism against our body's virus inhibitors. LDM contains a powerful antiviral, antibiotic extract derived from the root of a plant called lomatium dissectum. LDM has a viro-static effect, meaning it stops the growth of viruses, bacteria, molds and fungi in the body and eliminates the pathogenic micro-organisms without harming the ones necessary to good health. This extract has been shown to destroy 3CL and protect cells against viruses. LDM comes in an easy to use tincture that is added to water several times a day as a preventative or taken during high-risk periods to eradicate viruses and bacteria from the body. Aria offers three sizes of LDM that can be purchased [from our office](https://ariaintegrativehealth.com/contact/) and shipped directly to your home. 3. Vitamin D Although vitamin D is most recognized for its role in bone health, research has discovered it plays a crucial role in a wide range of health benefits, including immune system regulation. One of the largest misconceptions of vitamin D relates to its name. Vitamin D is actually a prohormone, not a vitamin. This means that once undergoing a couple activation processes in the body, it acts as a steroid hormone. In its activated state, vitamin D has the capacity to turn genes on and off, and affect the way a cell functions. Vitamin D is involved in the functioning of every system in our body, including the immune system. In fact, it directly regulates both the innate (nonspecific defense) and adaptive (specific defense) immunity. In addition, research has shown that vitamin D upregulates cathelicidin, an antimicrobial peptide. This offers a plausible mechanism of how it helps protect against upper respiratory tract infections. The team at Aria recommends adults take between 5,000 - 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day in order to ensure you reach optimal vitamin D status (40 - 80 ng/ml). This cannot be accomplished through your diet, so supplementation is key. Not all supplements are considered equal, so [contact us](https://ariaintegrativehealth.com/contact/) for brand recommendations. 4. Wellness Formula This unique formula contains a powerful combination of herbs, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals formulated to boost your immune system. But what makes this supplement so special from the thousands of options on the market today is it's inclusion of adaptogenic herbs. Why is this important? When we are chronically stressed, our body's ability to fight off pathogens becomes impaired, leading to an increased risk of infection. By taking a supplement containing herbs with adaptogenic properties, it may help improve our body's response to stressful events out of our control, such as a global viral pandemic. Reducing stress, combined with increasing antioxidant and key micronutrient intake ultimately enables us to more efficiently identify and destroy an infection before it takes root. Aria has Wellness Formula currently in stock at our office, so [give us a call](https://ariaintegrativehealth.com/contact/) to place your order to be shipped to your home. 5. Immune Boosting Foods In addition to the therapeutic tools and supplements mentioned above, we cannot understate the importance of eating an anti-inflammatory diet rich in immune boosting foods. Inflammation isn't always bad. In fact, it's our body's natural protective mechanism in response to foreign invaders or injury. Under normal circumstances, the body stops producing an inflammatory response after it has healed properly. Unfortunately, there are a variety of factors that can lead to chronic low grade inflammation, including eating processed foods that are difficult to digest, excessive alcohol intake and consuming too many sugars. This ultimately compromises your immune system over time and increases your risk of developing chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. In addition to removing pro-inflammatory foods and beverages from your diet, Jaci Salley, Holistic Nutritionist at Aria Integrative Health, has provided a list of anti-inflammatory foods rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to boost your immune system: - Flax seed - Citrus peel - Lemons & Limes - Oranges - Berries - Shiitake mushrooms - Dark leafy greens - Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, cabbage) - Sweet potatoes Here are some helpful herbs and spices to incorporate with your foods as well: - Oregano - Garlic - Ginger - Elderberry - Turmeric We are here for you The team at Aria understands the gravity of the situation our community is facing, and we want you to know that we are here for you.
