This often results in shortness of breath, fatigue, and difficulty performing daily activities due to pressure and fluid backup into the lungs. Many patients with heart failure experience repeated hos - pitalizations, poor quality of life, and a reduced life expectancy.PI: John Gurley, MD V-Wave Interatrial Shunt System V-Wave is a global medical device companydedicated to the treatment of heart failure. Thecompany has developed a minimally invasive,implanted device called the V-Wave InteratrialShunt for treating patients with HF. The V-Wave Shunt is an hourglass shaped device that is delivered through a catheter (a flexible plastic tube)inserted in a vein in the groin and implanted perma - nently across the wall dividing the left and right atria also known as the upper chambers of the heart. The procedure is performed in a hospital under sedation or anesthesia and typically takes less than ninety minutes. How the Device Works The V-Wave Interatrial Shunt is designed to reduce excess left atrial and left ventricular pressure. In HF, as pressure builds up, a small volume of blood is 'shunted' from the left to the right atrium through the device, thus relieving the elevated pressure and reduc - ing fluid backup in the lungs. About the RELIEVE-HF Clinical Trial V-Wave has approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) to conduct a large clinical study called the RELIEVE-HF Clinical Trial. The study will determine the effects of the Interatrial Shunt device, in comparison to optimal conventional therapies,on clinical outcomes that are important to HF paients. These include reducing hospitalizations or emergency room visits due to worsening HF, as well as improving symptoms, exercise capacity, and quality of life. The study is being performed at many centers around the world. Approximately 500 patients will be en - rolled. Your doctor can discuss with you the criteria for inclusion into the study as well as important in - formation about the testing and study procedures and the follow-up visits required. Are You a Candidate? You may be eligible for the RELIEVE-HFstudy if you have: Heart failure that causes noticeable symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, or difficulty performing daily activities (defined as New York Heart Class III or ambulatory Class IV HF) A hospital admission for HF within the past12 months, or an elevation in a certain blood test for HF, called BNP or NT-pro-BNP.For More informatio contact: Stephanie Phone: 859-323-5366 3 | Gill Quarterly, Winter 20204 | UK Gill Heart & Vascular Institute BIO LIBRA - AnaLysIs of Both Sex and Device Specific FactoRs on Outcomes in PAtients with Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy PI: Aaron Hesselson, MD Coordinator: Ben Rushing 323-5259 Brief Summary: This study is designed to evaluate the combined risk of all-cause mortality and treated ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) events by subject sex and by implanted device type. All-cause mortality, VT or VF alone, risk of cardiac death, and sudden car - diac death will be analyzed for the total cohort, as well as by subject sex and by the implanted device type OPTIMIZER SMART POST - APPROVAL STUDY PI: Aaron Hesselson, MD Coordinator: Ben Rushing 323-5259 Brief Summary: Post-approval study that evaluates data such as cardi - ac outcomes, quality of life, mortality, and function - ality. Long-term data needed to assess complication rates and potential interactions with other implant - able devices in the intended patient population.

The PRECISE Protocol: Prospective Random - ized Trial of the Optimal Evaluation of Cardiac Symptoms and Revascularization (PRECISE) PI: Vincent Sorrell, MD Coordinator: Ben Rushing 323-5259 Brief Summary: The study will be a prospective, pragmatic, random - ized clinical trial of the comparative effectiveness of diagnostic evaluation strategies for stable CAD, to be performed in outpatient settings, including primary care and cardiology practices. Women's IschemiA TRial to Reduce Events In Non-ObstRuctive CAD (WARRIOR) PI: Wells, The Ischemia-IMT (Ischemia-Intensive Non-Obstruc - tive CAD), subtitle: Women's Ischemia Trial to Reduce Events in Non-Obstructive CAD (WARRIOR) trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, blinded out - come evaluation (PROBE design) evaluating intensive statin/ACE-I (or ARB)/aspirin treatment (IMT) vs. usual care (UC) in 4,422 symptomatic women pa - tients with symptoms and/or signs of ischemia but no obstructive CAD. The hypothesis is that IMT will reduce major adverse coronary events (MACE) 20% vs. UC. This study is being conducted to determine whether intensive medication treatment to modify risk factors and vascular function in women patients with coronary arteries showing no flow limit obstruction but with cardiac symptoms (i.e., chest pain, shortness of breath) will reduce the patient's likelihood of dying, having a heart attack, stroke/TIA or being hospitalized for cardiac reasons. The esults will provide evidence data necessary to inform future guidelines regarding how best to treat this growing population of patients, and ultimately improve the patient's cardiac health and quality of life and reduce health-care costs.CURRENTLY ENROLLING CLINICAL TRIALSCURRENTLY ENROLLING CLINICAL TRIALSCLINICAL TRIALS CONTINUED RELIEVE - HF - REducing Lung congestIon symptoms using the v-wavE shunt in ad - VancEd Heart Failure PI: John Gurley, MD Coordinator: Stephanie Morris 323-5366 Brief Summary: The objective of this study is to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the V-Wave Interatrial Shunt System to improve clinical outcomes in a certain high-risk subset of symptomatic patients suffering from HF.

The study will be conducted by Mary Sheppard, an assistant professor of family medicine and surgery in the UK College of Medicine, and Mi - chael Samaan, an assistant professor of biomechanics in the UK College of Education Department of Kinesiolo - gy and Health Promotion. Marfan syndrome is a genetic condition that impacts the body's connective tissue. It most frequently affects the heart, blood vessels, eyes and bones. Diagnostic features can include a dilated aorta; dislocated lens; long arms, legs and fingers; a curved spine; a chest that sinks in or sticks out; flat feet; and an abnormally shaped hip joint, among others. The cardiovascular impacts of hav - ing Marfan syndrome can be signifi - cant, and have been the focus of the majority of prior research. The \"This combination of potentially weak hip joint musculature and ab - normal joint shape can lead to high amounts of hip joint loading during walking, which may cause hip pain and cartilage breakdown,\" Sheppard said. study at UK will be a first-look at the mechanisms involved in the onset of hip joint pain and cartilage degen - eration in patients with Marfan syndrome. Nearly half of patients with Mar - fan syndrome self-report hip joint pain yet it is highly unrecognized by clinicians. \"This combination of potentially weak hip joint musculature and ab - normal joint shape can lead to high amounts of hip joint loading during walking, which may cause hip pain and cartilage breakdown,\" Sheppard said. The research team will take a closer look at how the muscle weakness associated with Marfan syndrome leads to problems with hip joint muscle function, muscle morphol - ogy and gait mechanics. The exact association of these factors with the onset of hip joint pain and cartilage degeneration is unknown and of par - ticular interest to the researchers. \"A mechanistic assessment of the effects of Marfan syndrome on the muscles and hip is needed because, although patients with this syn - drome have weak quadriceps and hamstring muscles, we do not know whether or not the muscles around the hip joint are affected by the syn - drome. Our project will determine how hip joint muscle weakness, size, and amount of fat within the mus -Patients from Sheppard's clinic who volunteer for the study will have an MRI taken and have their gait analyzed in the UK Biodynamics Laboratory. The strength, size and amount of fat within their hip abduc - tors will be measured, as well as the corresponding effects on their hip joint movement patterns, hip joint pain and cartilage health. \"We will provide an understanding of how the hip joint functions during walking in patients with Marfan syndrome,\" Samaan said. \"We will provide an understanding of how the hip joint functions during walking in patients with Marfan syndrome,\" Samaan said. \"Our hope is that this will allow clinicians to develop treatments that can improve hip muscle function, reduce hip joint pain and reduce the risk of develop - ing hip osteoarthritis in people with Marfan syndrome.\" The researchers expect future studies will help create targeted muscle-based therapies to reduce hip pain in people with Marfan syn - drome and related conditions .2 | UK Gill Heart & Vascular Institute The Marfan Foundation is a non - profit organization that works to save lives and improve the quality of life for individuals and fam - ilies with Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, VEDS and other genetic aortic and vascular conditions through research, education and support.

Because of the expense of obtaining a U.S. medical license and lack of interest in repeat - ing another required residency, she pursued her passion for research. After completing a second master's in computer and information science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Li began working in medical research at the UAB. Three years later, she was recruited by the Alabama Quality Improvement Organization, a contractor for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services seeking to improve quality of care in a variety of service set - tings. Since then, Li has become an expert in quality improvement. During a stint at Northwestern University in Chicago, she worked with Mark Williams, MD, MHM, FACP, UK HealthCare's current chief qual - ity and transformation officer. Together, they worked to expand three quality improvement projects to more than 60 hospitals across Illinois. When Williams was recruit-ed by UK HealthCare to direct the Center for Health Services Research, he asked Li to help him develop Jing Li, MD, DrPH, MS, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine/Car - diovascular Medicine and co-direc - tor of the Center for Health Services Research the program. Since coming to UK HealthCare in January 2014, she has overseen many quality-improvement research projects and received major funding from several prestigious organizations, including the National Institutes of Health, Patient-Cen - tered Outcomes Research Institute, and the CMS. VS: If you could go back five or 10 years in your career, what would you say to your younger self?JL: People think having a mentor during their education and training is important. I would say if it is not more, it will be equally important to find a mentor at your work, espe - cially for people just starting. A lot of times, for people coming out of school, the education they receive is quite broad. [You need] to have somebody work with you to figure out what you're really passionate about, and also help you to develop a plan for yourself. VS: What is one work or life expe - rience that you appreciate for the lessons you learned?JL: The first project I did at Alabama QIO under CMS contract, I was told [that] we were required to reduce pressure ulcers at nursing homes. I did my homework and I pulled the data to see what worked at other places, but after three facilities told me \"No, that won't work,\" I went to my manager at that time. My man - ager told me, \"You told them, '[You] need to do better; this is what you should do.' You need to spend the time, understand their situation, andthen work with them together.\" So I gradually learned this skill, and I would say that's the lifetime lesson for me. VS: How do you foster self-growth outside of work?JL: I do a lot of self-reflection. If I cannot do it on a daily basis, I at least use the weekend to think about what happened in the past week and anything I really did well and should continue to do, and anything I feel like I could do better or do a different way. Sometimes I will talk with my friends and my mentors at UK and outside of UK to ask their opinion and share some thoughts with them. And I like having a new project where I can push myself to learn new knowledge and skills. VS: What is the most courageous thing you have done?JL: It's a pretty bold decision to move to another country. At that time, I had no idea how my career would be. I came alone and did not know anyone. I usually go back [to China] every year [to visit family]. This year the pandemic stopped everything. The good part right now is that with technology you can see family and so that helps.Also, I would say changing the job from UAB to Alabama QIO. I made a decision considering my interests and my future career, and it was not an easy decision. As a foreign person, we have this Visa limitation, so changing jobs is not easy and reduces the time for you to apply for permanent residency status.2 | UK Gill Heart & Vascular Institute VS: What was the hardest part about moving to the United States?JL: We started to learn English in my generation when I was in elementary school. We have six years in elementary school, so starting in year five, we start - ed learning English, and then through middle school, high school and college. But I got here and I still didn't know how to talk to people. It's a little scary. Can people understand me, or am I saying the right words? When you talk with people, what topics are appropriate and what are not? Af - ter a little bit, you start knowing people, and people are really nice, and they know you come from an - other country; a lot of times they help you. VS: What was most exciting about moving to the United States?JL: It's a different learning style regarding the overall educa - tion. You are told those are the required courses and then the others you feel free to choose whatever you want. In the edu- cation system back in China, all the courses are prescribed and all planned. Even when I was in medical school, there were not many optional classes. In the U.S., suddenly you have freedom to choose what you learn; I would say that's amazing. VS: What inspires you most in life?JL: When I started my internship and residency back in China, I worked at the largest hospital in my hometown. Even back then it had over 1,000 beds, and a lot of outstanding professionals worked there. I heard amazing stories about those people, [how] they built up the program with a very poor infrastructure, and how hard they worked and what type of research they did. You feel like you'll never be able to reach them, and then when you got an opportunity to be on rounds withthem, you saw how they interact - ed with patients, how they inter - acted with colleagues and how they mentored trainees. They are human beings, and they do notconsider themselves as heroes. That made me feel like I wanted to be one of those people; I want - ed to be able to achieve the same level of accomplishments and always try to be helpful to others.\"If you are lucky, you enjoy what you are doing. But there may be 80% of your job you enjoy and then there is 20% you don't. I just think about why I'm doing it, and I think about the people I work with, and most importantly about the difference we can make through what we do.\" VS: Who is your role model? JL: My older sister. I am amazed about her perseverance and re - silience. She suffered severe burn damage at work soon after high school, so she didn't go to college. This required her to tolerate se - vere pain during the recovery,and she never complained. Amaz - ingly she completed an associate degree during her recovery time. She is always a hard worker and always cares about family. Unfor - tunately, she was diagnosed with lymphoma last year and under - went intensive chemotherapy. But she maintains her optimism and focuses on what she can doand the good parts about life. VS: What are your strategies for dealing with stress anddifficult experiences at work?JL: If you are lucky, you enjoy what you are doing. But there may be 80% of your job you enjoy and then there is 20% you don't. On a trip to China, Jing Li visited a tea-leaf farm owned by a friend in Su - zhou, where she learned the process of picking and preparing the leaves to be used in making tea.14 | Gill Quarterly, Winter 2020 JING LI CONTINUED VS: What do you enjoy doing outside of work?JL: I'm more like an introverted person, and I'm OK establishing partnerships, relationships and leading projects, but I need my downtime. Most of the time I drink tea. I collect teapots, and so my kind of tea ceremony time, that's my downtime to regain energy. [My favorite tea] depends on on the different seasons and on the day. There is one type of clay, and it's only available in a small town in China and it can help make the tea flavor better.Over time that teapot also ab - sorbs the tea flavor. [It] needs to be one type of tea for one teapot; you can't mix them together. When I do all these types of things, it requires me to slow down and be in focus on what I'm doing, and I purely immerse myself in the moment. I also talk with my friends, and then I like cooking. [My favorite dish is] a stir fry. I do not use a recipe, so I just kind of see what type of meat or seafood and what type of vegetables I have in my fridge. Then I will just be cre - ative and do the combination by myself. VS: What do the Living DIReCT (diversity, innovation, respect, compassion, teamwork) values mean to you in your own words?JL: How I connect those together: diverse and innovative [people] can accomplish the most when they demonstrate the respect and the compassion for each other and their colleagues. A lot of times this respect and compas - sion is part of the requirement to be a team and to conduct teamwork and be innovative and generate good results. ______ During a tour of Suzhou, China, Jing Li visited a teapot store owned by a friend, who taught her the basics of making the clay teapots that she enjoys collecting.just think about why I'm doing it,and I think about the people I work with, and most importantly about the difference we can make through what we do. Other times I will talk with my mentors for I guidance. Sometimes I will pur - posely jump out of the box: I do not want to talk about it; I do not want to think about it. Just leave it maybe for several days and then later come back and try to look at it more from a thirdper - son perspective and reassess the situation to see if there is any - thing I can do.NEW FACULTY Gbolahan O.

(Oct. 27, 2020) \u2014 Dr. Emma Birks, UK HealthCare's heart failure section chief, is working on a new treatment therapy that recovers the hearts of some patients with advanced-stage chronic heart failure and ultimately cut down the number of heart transplants needed. Birks' study, \"REmission from Stage D Heart Failure: RESTAGE-HF,\" is featured in the publication Circula - tion. The multicenter study, involving 40 patients from six high-profile medi - cal centers across the United States, tested myocardial recovery using a cardiovascular treatment tool called ventricular assist devices (LVADs). LVADs are typically used in end- stage heart failure patients as a therapy of last resort, most often as a bridge to transplant or destina - tion therapy in patients considered to have failed medical therapy for advanced chronic heart failure. Birks' team has found that instead of using LVADs as a temporary solution, of sorts, it can be used in combination with aggressive medical therapy and regular testing of under - lying myocardial function, to pro - mote recovery of the patient's own heart, which ultimately can result in the patient recovering and the LVAD being removed. \"This could be a game-changer with very positive implications,\" Birks said. \"Not only can patients resume a normal quality of life and avoid the need for immunosuppressant drugs associated with transplant surgery, it also frees up a donor heart that can be used for patients with greater needs.\" Previously, the rate at which this occurs is reported as only 1-2% in the national LVAD registry, but Birks said that's only because few medical centers prospectively test or look for evidence of recovery, and often heart failure medications are not contin - ued or optimized after LVAD im - plantation. \"We have come up with a way to more effectively use a devicethat is already widely used and avail - able, by using it as a platform to add a drug regime designed to improve their heart function.\" Of the 40 patients receiving the pump as a bridge to transplant or as destination therapy, 40% of them achieved the highest end goal - to live free from mechanical support and heart transplantation one year after an LVAD explant (device removed). More than 50% of the patients were explanted overall. \"This is significant because the RE - STAGE-HF protocol was reproduc - ible with explants partici - pating sites,\" Birks said. \"We hope this will result in implementation of this strategy in other LVAD centers with broader application.\" Birks plans to focus on using the LVAD as a platform to induce myo - cardial recovery using this protocol as a \"Stage 1\" base that centers could more broadly adopt. \"We have come up with a way to more effectively use a device that is already widely used and available, by using it as a platform to add a drug regime designed to improve their heart function.\" Emma Birks, MDEmma Jane Birks, MD Section Chief Heart Failure, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine Visit : https://www.research.uky.edu/research-priorities-initiative-cardiovascu- lar-diseases/cardiovascular-diseases for more information.

RESEARCH FEATURE DISRUPTION OF THE CIRCADIAN SYSTEM Circadian disruption with constant light ex - posure exacerbates atherosclerosis 18;10(1):9920. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-66834-9. Disruption of the circadian system caused by disordered exposure to light is pervasive in modern society and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms by which this happens are largely unknown. What they did: In this study, we deter - mined the effects of light-induced circadian disruption on atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice. We induced severe disruption of circa - dian rhythms by exposing ApoE-/- mice to constant light for 12 weeks.What they found: Constant light exposure exacerbated atherosclerosis in male, but not female, ApoE-/- mice. Male ApoE-/- mice exposed to constant light had increased serum cholesterol concentrations due to increased VLDL/LDL fractions. Why it matters: Taken together, these data suggest that exacerbated dyslipidemia may mediate atherosclerotic lesion forma - light Lysophosphatidic Acid Mediates Cardiac Inflammation After Acute InfarctionNational Heart Lung and Blood Institute08/01/17-07/31/22 Doug Andres RIT1-Mediated Protection Fol -
