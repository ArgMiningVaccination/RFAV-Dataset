No consideration will be paid to either Sanof i or EUROAPI for the distribution of EU ROAPI shares in the Distribution in Kind. This Information Statement consists of (i) an unofficial English language translation of the prospectus for the purpose of listing EUROAPI shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (Compartment A) (\" Euronext Paris \") in connection with the Distribution in Kind (the \" Listing Prospectus \") in Annex A attached hereto and (ii) certain additional information for Sanofi shareholders in the specified Jurisdictions (collectively, the \" Information Statement \"). The Listing Prospectus received approval no. 22-076 from the French Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers (the \" AMF \") on March 31, 2022. On March 17, 2022, the Boar d of Directors of Sanofi unanimously approved the Distribution in Kind, subject to the approval by Sanofi's shareholders at Sanofi's comb ined general meeting to be held on May 3, 2022 (the \" General Meeting \"). At the General Meeting, Sano fi's shareholders will vote on the Distribution in Kind, including amendments to Sanofi's Articles of Association ( statuts ) to permit the Distribution in Kind. If approved, the Distribution in Kind will occur on May 10, 2022 (the \" Distribution Date \"). Sanofi shareholders as of May 9, 2022 (the \" Distribution Record Date \") will receive one share of EUROAPI for every 23 Sanofi shares that they hold as of the Distribution Record Date. Sanofi shareholders will not receive any fractional EUROAPI shares. In lieu of any such fractional shares, Sanofi shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive fractional share interests will receive a cash payment, as described in this Information Statement and in the List ing Prospectus incorporated herein by reference. In addition to the information contained in this Inform ation Statement, holders of American Depositary Shares, represented by American Depositary Receipts (\" ADRs \") representing Sanofi shares s hould refer to the information provided to them by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\" JP Morgan \"), as depositary for t he Sanofi ADR program (the \"Depositary \"). The Distribution in Kind will be taxable to shareholders of Sanofi under French law and will be subject to French withholding tax. For U.S. Federal income tax purposes , the Distribution in Kind will be treated as a taxable distribution by Sanofi to each Sanofi shareholder in an amount equal to the fair market value of the EUROAPI shares received by such shar eholder. For Australian income tax purposes , the Distribution in Kind will be subject to tax as a dividend and the value of the Distribution in Kind should be included in the assessable income of Sanofi shareholders who are Australian residents for tax purposes. See \"Taxation\" for further details. The shares of EUROAPI have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). This Information Statement is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer by Sanofi or EUROAPI to sell, or the solicitation of any offer to purchase or subscribe for or otherwise acquire, shares of EUROAPI. Sanofi is not requesting a proxy pursuant to this Information Statement. Beginning on or about May 6, 2022, the shares of EUROAPI are expected to be listed on Euronext Paris. Admission to listing and trading is subject to approval by Euronext Paris.

This Information Statement does not constitute or form a part of any offer to sell, or solicitation of any offer to purchase or subscribe for or otherwise acquire, securities of EUROAPI in any circumstances. The contents of this Information Statement do not constitute legal, tax or investment advice.

Neither Sanofi nor EUROAPI, nor their respective affiliates, nor any of their respective representatives, are making any representation to you regarding the legality of the receipt of the Distribution in Kind by any person under applicable investment or similar laws in any jurisdiction.

Sanofi reserves the right, to the extent permitted under French law, in its sole discretion and at any time, to modify or withdraw the shareholders' resolution to amend its Articles of Association ( statuts ) or approve the Distribution in Kind, including to distribute less than approximately 58% of the outstanding EUROAPI shares.

NOTICE TO PROS PECTIVE SHAREHOLDERS OF EUROAPI This Information Statement does not constitute or form a part of any offer to s ell, or solicitation of any offer to purchas e or subscribe for or otherwise acquire, securities of EUROAPI in any circumstances. France This Information Statement has not been and will not be s ubmitted to the clearance procedures of the AMF and accordingly may not be distributed to the public in France or used in c onnection with the distribution of the EUROAPI shares in France. For the purposes of the Distribution in Kind in France and the listing of the EUROAPI s hares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, a prospectus in the Frenc h language has been prepared and approved by the AMF under number 22-076 on March 31, 2022. Such prospectus is the only document pursuant to which the distribution of EUROAPI shares may be made in France. United States of America The Distribution in Kind is being conducted in accordance with and in reliance on the position taken by the Division of Corporation Finance of the SEC set forth in Staff Legal Bulletin No. 4 is sued on September 16, 1997 (\"SLB No. 4 \") that the shares distributed in a spin-off do not require registration under the Securities Act if, as is the cas e with respect to the Distribution in Kind, certain c onditions specified in SLB No. 4 are satisfie d. Consequently, the Distribution in Kind has not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United States. NEITHER THE SEC NOR ANY U.S. STATE SE CURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THE SHAR ES OF EUROAPI NOR DETERMIN ED WHETHE R THIS INFORMATION STATEMENT IS A CCURATE OR COMPLETE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRI MINAL OFFENSE. EUROAPI intends to c omply with the provisions of Rule 12g3-2(b) under the U.S. Sec urities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act \"). As a result, the EUROAPI shares will also be exempt from regis tration under the Exchange Act, and EUROAPI will not be required to file periodic or current reports with the SEC. Pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), an English translation of certain financial and business information that EUROAPI publicly files or that it makes available to its shareholders in Franc e will be published by EUROAPI on its website (www.euroapi.com). For the avoidance of doubt, information contained on EUROAPI's website is not incorpor ated into this Information Statement. The shares of EUROAPI will not be listed on any U.S. national securiti es exchange or interdealer quotation system in connection with the Distribution in Kind. Since the EUROAPI shares will not be listed on any U.S. securities exchange nor quoted on any inter-dealer quotation sy stem in the United States, it is unlikely that an active trading market will develop in the United States for the EUROAPI shares. Furthermore, EUROAPI will not issue any ADRs in the United States in c onnection with the Distribution in Kind and does not intend to cons ent to the creation of any ADR program in connection with the Distribution in Kind. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom this Information Statement is only being distributed to and direc ted at shareholders of Sanofi in c ircumstances whic h do not constitute an \"offer to the public\" under Article 2(d) of the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union 2 3 (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and communicated to them in circumstances which are exempt from the financial promotion restriction set out in section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of the United Kingdom (as amended) pursuant to Article 43 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended) of the United Kingdom. No part of the Information Statement should be published, reproduced, distributed or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person. Australia No placement document, prospectus, product disclosure statement or other disclosure document (including as defined in the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (\" Corporations Act\")) has been or will be lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASX Limited or any other governmental agency, in relation to the proposed pro rata distribution of shares of EUROAPI by Sanofi to its shareholders.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of future or conditional tense and prospective language, including the in each case, the negative form of these terms, or other variations or other com parable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Information Statement and include (i) statements r egarding Sanofi's intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, the comp letion, terms and timing of the Distribution in Kind and (ii) statements regarding EUROAPI's intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, its results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industries in which EUROAPI operates. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. The consummation and ultimate terms and timing of the Distribution in Kind and EUROAPI's actual financial condition, actual results of operations and cash flows, and the development of the industry in which it operates may, in each case, differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Information Statement. In addition, even if EUROAPI's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the development of the industry in which it operates, ar e consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Information Statement, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important factors that could cause actual events to differ from forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those described under the caption \" Risk Factors \" in this Information Statement and in Section 3 \" Risk Factors Relating to the Issuer \" and Section 22.2 \" Risks related to the Company's shares \" of the Listing Prospectus. Should one or more of these risks materialize, or should any underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, the Distribution in Kind and EUROAPI's actual financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could differ materially from what is described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. All forward-looking statements should be evaluated in light of their inherent uncertainty. In particular, this Information Statement includes forward-looking statements relating to EUROAPI's financial objectives, notably with respect to its medium-term outlook. These financial objectives are based upon a number of general and specific assumptions, including expectations as to the macroeconomic and regulatory environment and the cont inued implementation of EUROAPI's strategy, among others, which are subject to significant bu siness, operational, economic, regulatory and other risks, including the materialization of one or more of the risk factors described under the caption \" Risk Factors \" in this Information Statement and in Section 3 \" Risk Factors Relating to the Issuer \" and Section 22.2 \" Risks related to the Company's shares \" of the Listing Prospectus, many of which are outside of EUROAPI's control. EUROAPI may be unable to anticipat e all the risks, uncertainties or other factors likely to affect its business and to appraise their potential consequences, or to evaluate the extent to which the occurrence of a risk or a combination of risks could cause actual results to differ materially from EUROAPI's objectives. Although EUROAPI believes that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, these forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including matters not yet known to it or its management or not currently considered material, and there can be no assurance that anticipated events will occur or that the objectives set out will actually be achieved. Accordingly, recipients of this Information Statement should not rely on such 7 forward-looking statements as forecasts or estimates by EUROAPI and should carefully consider the risks described in this Information Statement. The forward-looking statements included in this Informat ion Statement speak only as of the date of this Information Statement. Market conditions are constantly changing and EUROAPI operates in a competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks, uncertainties and other factors may emerge that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Except as required by law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which their respective securities are listed, Sanofi and EUROAPI expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this Information Statement or the Listing Prospectus to reflect any change in their respective expectations or any change in events, conditions (including market conditions) or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement contained in this Information Statement or the Listing Prospectus is based. 8 PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION Financial information included in this Information Statement (including the audited consolidated financial statements of EUROAPI as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, an English translation of which is included in the Listing Prospectus) has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\" IFRS \") issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, as adopted by the European Union (\" EU\"). The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were audited by Ernst & Young Audit, independent statutory auditor of EUROAPI, as set forth in its audit report, an unofficial English translation of which is included in the Listing Prospectus. This is an unofficial English translation of the report that was originally issued in French, which has been provided solely for the benefit of English speakers. This Information Statement contains certain foreca sts, projections and other prospective financial information. Such prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward compliance with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The prospective financial information included in this Information Statement has been prepared by EUROAP I's management and is their sole responsibility. Ernst & Young Audit has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to such prospective financial information for the purpose of its inclusion herein, and, accordingly, do not provide any form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this Information Statement. The report of Ernst & Young Audit included in this Information Statement relates solely to EUROAPI's historical consolidated financial statements. It does not extend to the prospective financial information, and should not be read to so extend. Use of non-GAAP financial and operational measures This Information Statement contains information regarding EBITDA, Core EBITDA, and Core Free Cash Flow, or Core FCF, conversion, which are not re cognized measurements under IFRS. For descriptions of these measures and reconciliations to IFRS, see the Listing Prospectus under Section 8.1.4 \" Main performance indicators \" of the Listing Prospectus. The historical organization of EUROAPI's activities deviates from the target organizational and reporting structure decided upon during the implementation of t he Prior Reorganization Transactions (see Section 7.1 \"Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" in the Listing Prospectus). Consequently, in addition to the historical data and in order to provide comparable data that takes into account the impacts of the contractual and organizational provisions related to the implementation of EUROAPI's new business model resulting from the Prior Reorgani zation Transactions, as if it had been implemented as of January 1, 2019, EUROAPI is voluntarily providing restated financial information for the following indicators for the financial years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: restated revenue, restated gross profit, restated EBITDA, restated Core EBITDA and restated Core FCF conversion. This restated information, which takes the form of restated alternative performance indicators, is included in the Listing Prospectus. You should not consider items which are not recogni zed measurements under IFRS as alternatives to the applicable measurements under IFRS. These measur es have limitations as analytical tools and should not be treated as substitutes for IFRS measures. In particular, you should not consider such measurements of EUROAPI's financial performance or liquidity as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from (used in) operating ac tivities as a measurement of EUROAPI's liquidity. Other issuers with an activity similar to or different from that of EUROAPI could calculate EBITDA, Core 9 EBITDA, and Core FCF conversion and other such measures differently compared to the definitions adopted by EUROAPI. These measures are included in this Information St atement because we believe they are important indicators of the underlying historical performance of EUROAPI. They are used by EUROAPI as a main performance indicators and are regularly tracke d by EUROAPI's management to analyze and evaluate EUROAPI's businesses and trends, measure performance, prepare earnings forecasts and make strategic decisions. Rounding Certain numerical figures set out in this Information Statement, including financial data presented in millions or thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this Information Statement may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. 10 ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES Sanofi is a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme and EUROAPI is a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions simplifi\u00e9e (as of the date of this Information Statement), each incorporated in the Republic of France. The majority of the boards of directors and senior management of each of E UROAPI and Sanofi are citizens and residents of countries other than the United States, and a substantial portion of the assets of each of EUROAPI and Sanofi and the assets of such persons are located outside of the United States. Accordingly, U.S. persons may find it difficult and may be unable: to effect service of process upon or obtain jurisdiction over EUROAPI, Sanofi or their respective non-U.S. resident officers and directors in U.S. courts, or, pursuant to the French law of July 26, 1968, as amended by the law of July 16, 1980, to obtain evidence in France or from any French citizen or any individual being resident in France or any officer, representative, agent or employee of a legal person having its registered office or an establishment in a territory of France, in connec tion with actions predicated on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws; to enforce, either inside or outside the United States, judgments obtained in U.S. or non- U.S. courts in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against EUROAPI, Sanofi or their respective non-U.S. resident officers and directors; to bring an original action in a French court to enforce liabilities based upon the U.S. federal securities laws against EUROAPI, Sanofi or their respective non-U.S. resident officers and directors; and/or to enforce against EUROAPI, Sanofi, or their respective directors in non-U.S. courts, including French courts, judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Nevertheless, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would be recognized and enforced in France provided that a French judge considers that this judgment meets the French legal requirement concerning the recognition and the enforcement of foreign judgments and is capable of being immediately enforced in the United States. A French court is therefore likely to grant the enforcement of a foreign judgment without a review of the merits of the underlying claim, only if (1) the judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter as the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court, the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter, (2) the judgment does not contravene any international public policy rule applied by French courts, whether such rule pertains to the merits or pertains to the procedure of the case, including any defense right(s), (3) the U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud, and (4) the judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment (or an arbitral award) which has become effective in France. In addition, French law guarantees full compensation for the harm suffered but is limited to the actual damages, so the victim does not suffer or benefit from the situation, it being specified that under French law, the principle of awarding punitive damages is not, per se , contrary to public order, provided the amount awarded is not disproportionate to the harm suffered and the defendant's breach. 11 As a result, the enforcement, by U.S. shareholders, of any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the U.S. federal securities law against EUROAPI, Sanofi, or their respective members of their Board of Directors, officers or certain experts who are residents of France or countries other than the United States would be subject to the above conditions. In addition, the enforcement of any such judgments obtained in U.S. courts (or in any other court) against EUROAPI or Sanofi would be subject to lim itations arising from applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. Finally, there may be doubt as to whether a French court would impose civil liability on EUROAPI or Sanofi, the members of their respective Board of Directors, officers or certain experts named herein in an original action predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in France against EUROAPI or Sanofi or such members, officers or experts, respectively. 12 RISK FACTORS Recipients of this Information Statement should carefully consider the risks described in this section as well as those described in Section 3 \"Risk Factors Relating to the Issuer\" and Section 22.2 \"Risks related to the Company's shares\" in the Listing Prospectus that is incorporated by reference in this Information Statement, as well as the other information included and incorporated by reference in this Information Statement. These risks are not the only ones of relevance to the Distribution in Kind, the holding of EUROAPI securities, or the businesses of EUROAPI. Additional risks and uncertainties not known at present or that are deemed immaterial may also impair the Distribution in Kind and/or the business, operating results, financial condition, liquidity and prospects of EUROAPI. Risk Factors Relating to the Distribution in Kind It may be difficult to enforce civil liabilities against EUROAPI, Sanofi, and their respective directors and senior management. Sanofi is a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme and EUROAPI is a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions simplifi\u00e9e (as of the date of this Information Statement), each organized under the laws of France. A majority of the members of the boards of directors and senior management of Sanofi and EUROAPI reside and are citizens of countries that are outside of the United States, and a substantial portion of the assets of EUROAPI and Sanofi and the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the United States upon EUROAPI, Sanofi or such persons or to enforce against EUROAPI, Sanofi or such persons judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. We have been advised by our counsel that if an original action is brought in France predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite jurisdiction to grant the remedies sought. In addition, actions in the United States under the U.S. federal securities laws could be affected under certain circumstances by the French law of July 26, 1968, as amended by the law of July 16, 1980, which may preclude or restrict the obtaining of evidence in France or from French persons in connection with such actions. Because preemptive rights may not be available for persons in certain jurisdictions, the ownership percentages of such shareholders may be diluted in the event of future capital increases of EUROAPI. Under French law, shareholders have preemptive rights ( droits pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiels de souscription ) to subscribe, on a pro rata basis, for cash issuances of new shares or other securities giving rights to acquire additional shares. Holders of shares of EUROAPI outside of France may not be able to exercise preemptive rights unless certain regulatory actions are ta ken in such holder's jurisdictions. For example, U.S. holders may not be able to exercise such rights unless a registration statement under the Securities Act is effective with respect to the offer of new shares underlying those rights or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. EUROAPI will not be required to take regulatory actions (such a filing registration statements) in such jurisdictions in connection with issues of new shares or other securities giving rights to acquire shares to its shareholders, and does not expect to do so. As a result, EUROAPI may from time to time issue new shares or other securities giving rights to acquire additional shares at a time when the exercise of such rights is unavailable to holders in jurisdictions that require special regulatory action in connection therewith. If EUROAPI were to undertake future capi tal increases in such circumstances, holders of its 13 shares in such jurisdictions may be subject to dilution, which may not be fully compensated by the proceeds from the sale of rights. EUROAPI will not file periodic reports with the SEC. Pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, EUROAPI will be required to make available on its website English language versions of its annual repor ts, press releases and certain other information made public in France. However, unlike Sanofi, EUROAPI will not be required to file annual reports on Form 20-F with, or furnish current reports on Form 6-K to, the SEC. As a result, the level of disclosure and the type of information provided by EUROAPI to its shareholders in the United States may not be as extensive and detailed as those U.S. shareholders of Sanofi are accustomed to receiving. The Distribution in Kind may not be consummated. Sanofi is not obligated to consummate the Distribution in Kind and may, to the extent permitted under French law, in its sole discretion and at any time, modify or withdraw the shareholders' resolution to amend its Articles of Association ( statuts ) or approve the Distribution in Kind, including to distribute less than approximately 58% of the outstanding EUROAPI shares. In addition, the Distribution in Kind is conditioned upon approval of Sanofi's shareholders at Sanofi's General Meeting and the listing of the shares is conditioned on the admission by Euronext Paris of the shares to trading. If Sanofi's shareholders do not approve the Distribution in Kind or if Sanofi elects not to proceed with the Distribution in Kind for any reason, this could be negatively perceived by investors and could adversely affecting the price of Sanofi's shares. EUROAPI shares will not be listed in any other jurisdiction outside of France. EUROAPI's shares will not be listed on any other securities exchange or quoted in any automated interdealer quotation system in any jurisdiction other than France. EUROAPI will not issue any ADRs in the United States in connection with the Distribution in Kind and does not intend to consent to the creation of any unsponsored ADR program in connection with the Distribution in Kind. Accordingly, although EUROAPI has applied for the listing of its shares on Euronext Paris, it may be difficult for shareholders in other jurisdictions to execute transactions as quickly or efficiently as would be possible if a public market existed in such shareholders' jurisdictions. Shareholders in such other jurisdictions may be required to incur additional administrative fees in connection with the execution of transactions on Euronext Paris. A liquid trading market for EUROAPI shares may not develop. There is currently no public market for the shares of EUROAPI. Although shares of EUROAPI are expected to be listed on Euronext Paris beginning on or about May 6, 2022, admission to listing and trading is subject to approval by Euronext Paris and there is no assurance that such listing will become effective or that a liquid trading market for EUROAPI shares will develop. The liquidity and market for EUROAPI shares may be affected by a number of factors, including changes in exchange rates and interest rates, volatility of markets for similar securities, and changes in EUROAPI's liquidity, financial conditions, earnings and profitability. As a result, the initial trading price of EUROAPI shares may not be indicative of their future trading value. The Distribution in Kind will be a taxable transaction for U.S. and Australian holders of Sanofi's ordinary shares or ADRs, and may be for other holders as well . The Distribution in Kind will be treated as a dividend to shareholders of Sanofi under French law and will be subject to French withholding tax. For U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the Distribution in 14 Kind will be treated as a taxable distribution by Sanofi to each Sanofi shareholder in an amount equal to the fair market value of the EUROAPI shares (calculated in U.S. dollars) received by such shareholder. This distribution should be a \"Qualified Dividend\" for U.S. Federal purposes, and thus be taxable at a maximum rate of 20%, In addition, a U.S. Medicare tax of 3.8% and U.S. state taxes may apply. For Australian tax purposes, the Distribution in Kind should be treated as a dividend subject to tax at normal tax rates (plus the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge, if relevant). Australian Holders should include the Australian-dollar value of the Distribution in Kind they receive (including any cash received in respect of the Distribution in Kind) in their assessable income for the income year in which they receive the Distribution in Kind. See \"Taxation\" for further details. The Distribution in Kind may be a taxable transaction for holders in other jurisdictions as well. All holders should consult their tax advisers. ADR holders that receive the net cash proceeds from the Depositary's sale of their shares of EUROAPI will have no control over the timing or manner of such sale. As the record holder for all Sanofi shares represented by ADRs, the Depositary will receive shares of EUROAPI in the Distribution in Kind on behalf of Sanofi's ADR holders. Pursuant to the terms of the deposit agreement between the Depositary, Sanofi, and the owners and beneficial owners of ADRs, the Depositary has deemed the distribution of EUROAPI shares to ADR holders not to be feasible, and will sell the EUROAPI shares that it receives in the Distribution in Kind and distribute the net cash proceeds of such sale to holders of ADRs as of the relevant record date. Depending on market conditions, the sale of those EUROAPI shares may occur over an extended period of time and through multiple transactions. ADR holders will have no control over the timing of such transactions, the timing of the conversion of the proceeds of such sales into U.S. Dollars or the timing of the distribution of such proceeds to ADR holders, which will be at the sole discretion of the Depositary. Further, the Depositary has no obligation to minimize any adverse impact on the amount of U.S. Dollar proceeds distributed to ADR Holders that may result from fluctuations in the trading price of the EUROAPI shares or the exchange rate at which euro proceeds are converted into U.S. Dollars. In addition, the efforts of the Depositary to sell a substantial number of shares of EUROAPI, may have an adverse effect on the price of such shares. The Depositary will not have to make any interim payments to ADR holders before all sales of the EUROAPI shares are completed. Because shares of EUROAPI are traded in euro, any proceeds from the sale of shares in EUROAPI will be denominated in euro; holders in non-eurozone jurisdictions will be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations when converting such proceeds into their functional currency, whether U.S. dollars or otherwise. Because EUROAPI's shares trade in euro, the net proceeds of any sale of the shares will also be denominated in euro. Any significant foreign exchange fluctuations in the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate or in any the exchange rate between the euro and any other currency could have an adverse impact on the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of EUROAPI being distributed. Future exchange rate fluctuations cannot be predicted. 15 EUROAPI and Sanofi may incur unanticipated costs. EUROAPI and Sanofi will incur costs in connection with the Distribution in Kind, including those related to accounting, tax, legal and other prof essional services, costs associated with operating EUROAPI as an independent company, and costs of separating employees, assets and information systems, among others. These costs could be greater than expected and could adversely affect EUROAPI's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that EUROAPI will achieve the operational and financial objectives of the Distribution in Kind. There can be no assurance that EUROAPI will achieve the strategic, operational and financial objectives of the Distribution in Kind or the listing of its shares on Euronext Paris, or that Sanofi will receive the contemplated benefits of the transaction. Sanofi believes that the Distribution in Kind is justified by the contemplated benefits, which include, in addition to the benefits of the Distribution in Kind itself: (1) simplified focus and operational flexibility that will enable each of Sanofi and EUROAPI to be better able to dedicate resources to pursue unique growth opportunities and execute strategic plans best suited to their respective businesses, (2) a business-appropriate capital structure for EUROAPI, (3) dedicated management, (4) the creation of the conditions for EUROAPI to enhance its status as a partner of choice for all pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and (5) the achievement of greater independence and visibility so that EUROAPI can become a global leader in the production of APIs. However, the expected benefits may not materialize and the assumptions under which Sanofi determined to undertake the Distribution in Kind may prove to be incorrect. If EUROAPI fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Distribution in Kind, or if these benefits are delayed, EUROAPI's business and results of operations could be adversely affected. The combined value of EUROAPI shares and Sanofi shares post-Distribution in Kind may not equal or exceed the value of Sanofi shares pre-Distribution in Kind. There can be no assurance that the combined trading prices of Sanofi shares and EUROAPI shares following the Distribution in Kind, as adjusted for any changes in the combined capitalization of the two companies, will be equal to or greater than the trading price of Sanofi shares prior to the Distribution in Kind. Until the market has fully evaluated the business of Sanofi without the EUROAPI business, the price at which shares of Sanofi shares trade may fluctuate. Similarly, until the market has fully evaluated the EUROAPI business, the price at which EUROAPI shares trade may fluctuate more than what might otherwise be expected. 16 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION IN KIND The following discussion addresses certain questions regarding the Distribution in Kind. You are encouraged to carefully read the Listing Prospectus, which includes additional details. Q: Is the Distribution in Kind subject to shareholder approval? A: Yes. Sanofi's Board of Directors approved the Distribution in Kind, subject to the approval of Sanofi's shareholders at the General Meeting to be held on May 3, 2022. At the General Meeting, Sanofi's shareholders will vote on the Distribution in Kind, including amendments to Sanofi's Articles of Association ( statuts ) to permit the Distribution in Kind. Q: What vote is required in order for the Distribution in Kind to be approved by the Sanofi shareholders' General Meeting? A: The Distribution in Kind will be approved if: the resolution to make the requisite amendments to Sanofi's Articles of Association ( statuts ) are approved by a vote of Sanofi shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the shares present or represented at the meeting; and the resolution relating to the Distribution in Kind is approved by a vote of Sanofi shareholders representing a simple majority of the shares present or represented at the meeting. If the resolution relating to the Distribution in Kind is approved but the resolution to make the requisite amendments to Sanofi's Articles of Association ( statuts ) is not approved, then Sanofi will not proceed with the Distribution in Kind. Q: How do I vote at the General Meeting? A: This Information Statement is provided for informational purposes only, and Sanofi is not requesting a proxy pursuant to this Information Statement. Holders of Sanofi shares or ADRs as of the applicable record date for the General Meeting will receive notice of the General Meeting and separate voting instructions. Depending on the format in which you hold your Sanofi shares or ADRs, this information may be provided to you by your financial intermediary or, in the case of ADRs registered in your name on the books of the Depositary, by the Depositary. Please carefully read those materials and promptly act in accordance with the instructions in such materials. Q: Is Sanofi obligated to consummate the Distribution in Kind? A: No. Sanofi is not obligated to consummate the Distribution in Kind and may, to the extent permitted under French law, in its sole discretion and at any time, modify or withdraw the shareholders' resolution to amend its Articles of Association ( statuts ) or approve the Distribution in Kind, including to distribute less than approximately 58% of the outstanding EUROAPI shares. 17 Q: If the Distribution in Kind is approved, what will Sanofi distribute to its shareholders? A: If the Distribution in Kind is approved, Sanofi shareholders as of the record date for the Distribution in Kind will receive one share of EUROAPI for every 23 Sanofi shares that they hold. Sanofi shareholders that do not hold an even multiple of 23 Sanofi shares will (i) receive a number of EUROAPI shares equal to the immediat ely lower whole number of shares obtained by multiplying their number of Sanofi shares by 1/23 and rounding down to the nearest whole number and (ii) a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares that such shareholder would otherwise be entitled to receive (see \" Will fractional EUROAPI shares be delivered as part of the Distribution in Kind? \" below). In addition, a Sanofi shareholder's financial intermediary may be required to sell some of the shares of EUROAPI, and/or as the case may be to retain amounts of the cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares, that such Sanofi shareholder would otherwise receive pursuant to the Distribution of Kind, in order to fulfill a Sanof i shareholder's financial intermediary's contractual and/or regulatory rights and obligations, such as withholding tax (see \" What will be the tax treatment of the Distribution in Kind? \"). As a result, the amount of shares of EUROAPI and/or the cash payment in lieu of fractional shares that a Sanofi shareholder will receive may vary depending on the shareholder's financial intermediary and individual circumstances. Q: Will Sanofi retain any EUROAPI shares? A: Yes. Upon completion of the Distribution in Kind, Sanofi will hold approximately 42% of all outstanding shares of EUROAPI. The French State, through the fund EPIC Bpifrance, has agreed to acquire 12% of EUROAPI's share capital from Sanofi for a maximum of \u20ac150.0 million (the \" French State Placement \"), following completion of the Distribution in Kind. Following the Distribution in Kind and the French State Placement, Sanofi will retain approximately 30% of EUROAPI. Sanofi and the French State have both agr eed, subject to customary exceptions, to hold their EUROAPI shares for 24 months from, re spectively, the Distribution Date and the date of settlement and delivery of the EUROAPI shares purchased by the French State, i.e., on June 17, 2022. After that period, both Sanofi and the French State would be free to sell their shares, subject to applicable securities laws. Q: Will fractional EUROAPI shares be delivered as part of the Distribution in Kind? A: No. Sanofi shareholders will not receive any fractional EUROAPI shares. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each Sanofi shareholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share interest shall receive a cash payment, as described below. If a Sanofi shareholder would otherwise be entitled to receive fractional EUROAPI shares, such fractional EUROAPI shares will be aggregated by the relevant intermediary and sold into the market on Euronext Paris. Following completion of such sale, each such Sanofi shareholder will receive from the relevant intermediary on a pro rata basis (based on the fractional shares such holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive), a cash payment of the net proceeds of such sale subject to, as the case may be, tax withholding and/or other adjustments as may be imposed by regulation or contract, by the S anofi shareholder's financial intermediary (see \" If the Distribution in Kind is approved, what will Sanofi distribute to its shareholders? \"). 18 It is expected that such cash payment in lieu of fractional EUROAPI shares will be credited by the relevant intermediary to the accounts of such Sanofi shareholders as soon as practicable after the Distribution Record Date. Recipients of cash in lieu of fractional EUROAPI shares will not be entitled to any interest on the amounts of payment made in lieu of fractional shares. Q: When is the Distribution in Kind expected to occur? A: If approved, the Distribution in Kind is expected to occur on the Distribution Date, with the ex- dividend date for Sanofi's Distribution in Kind (the \" Ex-Dividend Date \") expected to occur on May 6, 2022. For more information see Section 22.1.1 \" Provisional calendar for the Distribution in Kind\" of the Listing Prospectus, incorporated by reference herein. Q: As of what date do I need to be a Sanofi shareholder in order to receive shares of EUROAPI? A: Persons who have Sanofi shares recorded in their name for bookkeeping purposes (enregistrement comptable ) at 5:00 p.m. (Paris time) on the Distribution Record Date= will be entitled to participate in the Distribution in Kind. In the case of a trade entered into before, but settled after, the Ex-Dividend Date, shares of EUROAPI will be credited to the purchaser, and the seller who sold prior to the Ex-Dividend Date will not receive the Distribution in Kind. In order to receive any shares of EUROAPI in the Distribution in Kind, a Sanofi shareholder must hold at least 23 Sanofi shares as of the Distribution Record Date (i.e., including any trades entered during the trading day in Paris on May 5, 2022, for which settlement and delivery will occur on May 9, 2022). For holders of Sanofi ADRs, the Depositary will set the ADR record date for the distribution of net proceeds relating to the EUROAPI shares after the sale of the EUROAPI shares has been completed and the amount to be received per ADR has been determined. The ADR record date will be used to determine ADR holders entitled to receive the net proceeds from the Depositary's sale of EUROAPI shares that it receives on behalf of ADR holders and who shall be responsible for any fee assessed to ADR holders by the Depositary pursuant to this Deposit Agreement. Q: Are ADR holders able to participate in the Distribution in Kind? A: As the record holder for all Sanofi shares represented by ADRs, the Depositary will receive shares of EUROAPI in the Distribution in Kind on behalf of Sanofi's ADR holders. The Depositary has informed Sanofi that it deems the distribution of EUROAPI shares to Sanofi's ADR holders not to be feasible. Accordingly, pursuant to the terms of the deposit agreement between the Depositary, Sanofi and the owners and beneficial owners of ADRs, the Depositary has determined that it will sell the EUROAPI shares in one or more transactions and distribute the net cash proceeds of the sale to ADR holders on the relevant record date established by the Depositary. Q: Are there steps an ADR holder can take to be able to receive EUROAPI shares in the Distribution in Kind? A: Yes. ADR holders may, in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement for the ADR program, present ADRs to the Depositary for cancellation and receive the corresponding number of underlying ordinary shares. In order to receive EUROAPI shares in the Distribution in Kind, such Sanofi ordinary shares must be held as of the Distribution Record Date. 19 Q: Will ADR holders be required to pay any fees and expenses to the Depositary? A: Yes. ADR holders as of the ADR record date will be responsible for certain fees and expenses of the Depositary, as provided in the Deposit Agreement. Q: What should I do if I hold Sanofi ADRs? A: ADR holders need not take any action in order to be entitled to their proportionate interest in the net cash proceeds from the Depositary's sale of the EUROAPI shares. ADR holders are cautioned that certain additional record dates and deadlines may be applicable to holders of ADRs. If you are a registered holder of ADRs on the books of the Depositary, you can contact the Depositary at +1-877- 272-9475 with any questions. Holders of ADRs that hold their ADRs through a bank, broker or other nominee should contact that entity with any questions they might have. Q: What will be the tax treatment of the Distribution in Kind? A: The Distribution in Kind will be treated as a dividend to shareholders of Sanofi under French law and will be subject to French withholding tax. For U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the Distribution in Kind will be treated as a taxable distribution by Sanofi to each Sanofi shareholder (including ADR holders) in an amount equal to the fair market value of the EUROAPI shares (calculated in U.S. dollars) received by such shareholder. This distribution should be a \"Qualified Dividend\" for U.S. Federal purposes, and thus be taxable at a maximum rate of 20%. In addition, a U.S. Medicare tax of 3.8% and U.S. state taxes may apply. For Australian tax purposes, the Distribution in Kind should be treated as a dividend subject to tax at normal tax rates (plus the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge, if relevant). Australian Holders should include the Australian-dollar value of the Distribution in Kind they receive (including any cash received in respect of the Distribution in Kind) in their assessable income for the income year in which they receive the Distribution in Kind. See \"Taxation\" for further details. The Distribution in Kind may be a taxable transaction for holders in other jurisdictions as well. All holders should consult their tax advisers. Q: Whom can I contact if I have further questions? Shareholder Hotline Sanofi Telephone: +33 9 86 87 80 65 20 TAXATION The following summary describes certain French, U.S. federal and Australian income tax consequences relating to the acquisition, ownership and dispositi on of the EUROAPI shares as of the date hereof. If you are considering the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the EUROAPI shares, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the French and U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to you in light of your particular situation as well as any consequences arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction. Certain French tax considerations The following is a general summary of certain French tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposal by holders of the EUROAPI shares to be acquired in the Distribution in Kind (i) who are domiciled or resident for tax purposes outside France and (ii) who do not own their shares of EUROAPI in connection with a fixed base or permanent establishment in France. The following general summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to acquire, own or dispose of the EUROAPI shares. This summary is based on the tax laws and regulations of France, the practice of the French tax authorities and the applicable double taxation conventions or treaties with France, all as currently in force, and all subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Investors should consult their own tax advisors in determining the tax consequences to them of acquiring, holding and disposing shares of EUROAPI to their particular situation. French law has enacted specific rules relating to trusts, in particular specific tax and filing requirements as well as modifications to wealth, estate and gift taxes as they apply to trusts. Given the complex nature of these rules and the fact that their application varies depending on the status of the trust, the grantor, the beneficiary and the assets held in the trust, the following summary does not address the tax treatment of the EUROAPI shares held in a trust. If the EUROAPI shares are held in trust, the grantor, trustee and beneficiary are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of the EUROAPI shares. Non-residents of France for tax purposes will have to comply with applicable tax laws of their state of residence and, as the case may be, the applicable tax treaty entered into between France and such state. Dividends Withholding tax In France, dividends are paid out of after-tax income. Subject to provisions of tax treaties that may apply and subject to the exceptions listed below, the dividends distributed by the Company will, in principle, be subject to a withholding tax, deducted by the paying agent of the dividends, where the tax domicile or seat of the effective beneficiary is located outside France. 21 Subject to what is stated below and more favorable provisions of international tax treaties, the rate of this withholding tax is set at: (i) 12.8% when the dividend derives from a regular distribution decided by the competent body of the Company and when the beneficial owner is an individual (additional taxes such as contribution on high incomes are not included), (ii) 15% where the beneficiary is a non-profit organization ( organismes sans but lucratif ) that has its registered office in a Member State of the European Union or in another Member State of the European Economic Area Agreement that has concluded with France a tax treaty providing for administrative assistance against tax fraud and evasion, that would be taxed according to the treatment referred to in Article 206, 5 of the French Tax Code if it had its seat in France and as construed by paragraphs 580 et seq. of the tax guidelines issued by the French tax authorities (BOI-IS-CHAMP-10-50-10-40-20130325) and relevant case law, and (iii) the standard corporate income tax rate set out in Article 219 of the French Tax Code, i.e., 25% for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2022 (additional taxes such as the 3.3% surtax on CIT are not included). However, subject to the provisions of international tax treaties, regardless of the place of residence, the registered office, or status of the beneficiary, dividends paid by the Company outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (a \" Non- Cooperative State \") (other than those mentioned in 2\u00b0 of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the same Code), will be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 75% unless the Company proves that neither the purpose nor the effect of the distribution of such dividends is to situate them in such State or territory for purposes of facilitating tax fraud, pursuant to the provisions of Articles 119 bis and 187 of the French Tax Code. The list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial decree and may be updated at any time and in principle once a year. The provisions of the French Tax Code referring to Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code shall apply to Non-Cooperative States added on this list as from the first day of the third month following the publication of the ministerial decree. Shareholders that are legal persons may benefit from a withholding tax reduction or exemption, notably: - Under Article 119 ter of the French Tax Code which applies under certain conditions to persons having their effective place of management in a State of the European Union or in another Member State of the European Economic Area Agr eement that has concluded with France a tax treaty providing for administrative assistance against tax fraud and evasion, if they hold at least 10% of the Company distributing the dividends during two years and otherwise meet all the conditions of such article as construed by the guidelines issued by the French Tax Authorities (BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-30-20-10-20190703), this being spec ified that this threshold is reduced to 5% of the capital of French distributing company where the legal person who is the beneficial owner of the dividends holds a participation satisfying the conditions laid down in Article 145 of the French Tax Code and is deprived of any opportunity to offset the withholding tax incurred against any profit in their State of residence (the detention rates taking into account full or bare ownership); or - Under Article 119 quinquies of the French Tax Code which applies to persons having their effective place of management in a Member State of the European Union or in another State or territory that has concluded with France a tax treaty providing for administrative assistance against tax fraud and evasion, and which are subject to a liquidation procedure that is comparable to the one mentioned in Article L. 640-1 of the French Commercial Code (or, where there is no such procedure available, in a situation in which payments are suspended and in a 22 situation where the recovery is being manifestly impossible) and fulfilling all the conditions laid down in Article 119 quinquies of the French Tax Code as construed by the guidelines issued by the French Tax Authorities (BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-30-20-80-20160406); or - Pursuant to the provisions of applicable tax treaties. In particular, under the Convention Between the United States of America and the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital of August 31, 1994, as amended (the \" Treaty \"), the rate of French withholding tax on dividends paid to a U.S. Holder that is a U.S. tax resident under the Treaty fully eligible for the benefits of the Treaty pursuant to the \"Limitation on Benefits\" provision of such Treaty (hereinafter a \" U.S. Resident Holder \") and whose ownership of the EUROAPI shares is not effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base that such U.S. Resident Holder has in France is reduced to 15% and such U.S. Resident Holder may claim a refund from the French tax authorities of the amount withheld in excess of the Treaty rate of 15%, if any. For U.S. Resident Holders that are not individuals, the requirements for eligibility for Treaty benefits, contained in the \"Limitation on Benefits\" provision of the Treaty are complex, and U.S. Resident Holders are advised to consult their own tax advisors regarding their eligibility for Treaty benefits, in light of their own particular circumstances. The shareholders concerned should consult their tax advisors to determine whether and under which conditions they may qualify for one of these exemptions. Moreover, dividend income distributed to collective investment undertakings incorporated under foreign law, which (i) are located in a Member State of the European Union or in another State that has concluded with France a tax treaty providing for administrative assistance against tax fraud and evasion which meets the conditions specified in Article 119 bis, 2 of the French Tax Code, (ii) raise capital from a certain number of investors with the purpose of investing it in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of such investors, pursuant to a defined investment policy and ( iii) have characteristics similar to those required of collective undertakings fulfilling the conditions set forth in Article 119 bis, 2-2 of the French Tax Code as construed by the guidelines issued by the French Tax Authorities (BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-30-20-70- 20211006), may also benefit from a withholding tax exemption. The investors concerned should consult their usual tax advisors to determine the ways in which these provisions apply to their own specific circumstances. In addition, Article 235 quater of the French Tax Code provides for a mechanism enabling to obtain a refund of the withholding tax along with a tax deferral applicable to shareholders who are legal entities or organizations (i) whose result of the fiscal year during which the dividends distribution is received generates tax losses, (ii) whose registered office or permanent establishment in the result of which the income and profits are included is located (x) in a Member State of the European Union, (y) in another Member State of the European Economic Area Agreement that is not a Non-Cooperative State and that has concluded with France a tax treaty providing for administrative assistance against tax fraud and evasion and a mutual assistance agreement on recovery with a scope similar to that provided for in Council Directive 2010/24/EU of March 16, 2010 or (z) in a State outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, that is not a Non-Cooperative State and that has concluded with France the above-mentioned conventions, provided that the sharehol ding held in the distributing company does not allow the beneficiary to participate effectively in the management or control of this company or organization and (iii) complying with the reporting obligations set forth in Article 235 quater of the French Tax Code. The tax deferral would terminate with respect to the fiscal year in which the concerned shareholder would become profitable as well as in cases set out in Article 235 quater of the French Tax Code. 23 It is the responsibility of the Company's shareholders to consult their usual tax advisors (i) to determine whether they are likely to fall within the scope of the legislation relative to Non-Cooperative States, and/or to qualify for a reduction to or exemption from the withholding tax by virtue of the preceding principles or provisions of tax treaties, and (ii), as the case may be, to determine the practical formalities to be complied with to benefit from such reduction or exemption, including those provided for by BOI- INT-DG-20-20-20-20-20120912 relating to the so-called \"standard\" or \"simplified\" procedure for the reduction of or exemption from the withholding tax (see below \"\u2014 Procedures for Claiming Treaty Benefits \"). Since July 1, 2019, Article 119 bis A of the French Tax Code provides, for an anti-abuse measure, whereby the paying agent is required to withhold the withholding tax applicable to dividends in the case of temporary sales of securities or similar trans actions around the payment of dividends, allowing non- resident shareholders of French companies to avoid the withholding tax normally applicable. In this case, the withholding tax would apply without the beneficiary being able to use the so-called simplified procedure in order to benefit from the more favorable provisions of the tax treaty that may be applicable. However, the text provides, subject to certain conditions, for a safe harbor measure to obtain the refund of all or part of the withholding tax levied if it proves that the payment corresponds to a transaction that has a main purpose and effect other than to avoid t he application of a withholding tax or to obtain the benefit of a tax advantage. Shareholders who may be affected are advised to consult their tax adviser to determine the consequences of this measure for their particular situation. Lastly, non-French tax residents must also comply with the tax laws in force in their State of residence, as may be modified by the tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation signed between France and such jurisdiction. Procedures for claiming treaty benefits Pursuant to the guidelines issued by the French tax authorities (BOI-INT-DG-20-20-20-20-20120912), shareholders who are entitled to treaty benefits under an applicable tax treaty with France (including the Treaty) can claim such benefits under a simplified procedure (provided that it is possible under the provisions of the tax treaty) or under the standard procedure. Specific requirements apply to certain investors, such as UCITS, pension funds, U.S. persons, etc. The procedure to be followed generally depends upon whether the application for treaty benefits is filed before or after the dividend payment. Under the simplified procedure, in order to benefit from the lower rate of withholding tax applicable under the relevant tax treaty on the dividend payment date, the shareholder must complete and deliver to the bank or financial institution managing its account or to the paying agent, before the dividend payment, a certificate of residence (Form 5000) stamped by the tax authorities of the jurisdiction of residence of such shareholder stating in particular that the recipient of the dividend: is beneficially entitled to the income for which the treaty benefits are being claimed; is a resident of the other contracting State for the purposes of the relevant tax treaty; does not have any establishment or permanent base in France to which the dividend income is attached; and has reported or will report this dividend to the tax authorities of the shareholder's country of residence; 24 The simplified procedure is applicable to collective investment schemes, subject to filing an additional form establishing the percentage of shares held by residents of the relevant jurisdiction. If the Form 5000 is not filed prior to the dividend payment, the normal procedure is applicable. In such a case, a withholding tax is levied at the ordinary French withholding tax rate, and the shareholder has to claim a refund for the excess withholding tax by filing both Form 5000 and Form 5001, with the French tax authorities, no later than December 31 of the second year following the year during which the dividend is paid or no later than the date provided by the applicable tax treaty. Copies of Form 5000 and Form 5001 are available on www.impots.gouv.fr. It is the responsibility of the Company's shareholder s to consult their usual tax advisors to determine whether they are likely to fall within the legislation relative to Non-Cooperative States, or to qualify for a reduction to or exemption from the withholding tax by virtue of the preceding principles or provisions of the Treaty, and to determine the practical formalities to be complied with to benefit from these provisions. Sale or other disposition Subject to provisions of applicable tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation, under Article 244 bis B and C of the French Tax Code, capital gains on the sale of the EUROAPI shares are not subject to tax in France when they are realized by persons who are not domiciled in France within the meaning of Article 4 B of the French Tax Code or whose registered office is located outside France (and who do not own their shares of EUROAPI in connection with a fixed base or a permanent establishment subject to tax in France and on the balance sheet of which the EUROAPI shares are recorded), provided that the seller has not held, directly or indirectly, alone or with family members, in the case of individuals, a stake representing more than 25% of the rights in the Company's earnings ( droits aux b\u00e9n\u00e9fices sociaux ) at one point in time during the five-year period preceding the sale. Moreover, regardless of the percentage of rights held in the earnings of the Company, when such gains are made by persons or organizations domiciled, established or incorporated outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those mentioned in 2\u00b0 of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code, the capital gains are taxed at 75%. The list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial decree and may be updated at any time and in principle once a year. The provisions of the French Tax Code referring to Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code shall apply to Non-Cooperative States added on this list as from the first day of the third month following the publication of the ministerial decree. Under the Treaty, a U.S. Resident Holder that is eligible for the benefits of the Treaty will not be subject to French tax on any capital gain from the sale or exchange of shares of EUROAPI unless the EUROAPI shares form part of the business property of a permanent establishment or fixed base that the U.S. Resident Holder has in France. Persons who do not meet the conditions of this exem ption should consult their usual tax advisors and to what extent recent case law and Article 2 of the Amended Finance Act of July 19, 2021, can provide a basis for avoiding the taxation in France. Shareholders who are not French tax residents are urged to consult with their usual tax advisor in order to determine the tax regime applicable to their own situation both in France and in the jurisdiction where they reside for tax purposes. Registration tax and financial transaction tax Pursuant to Article 726 of the French Tax Code no registration tax ( droits d'enregistrement ) is payable in France on the sale of shares in a listed company that has its registered office in France, unless the sale 25 is recorded in a deed signed in France or abroad. In the latter case, unless the transaction is subject to the French Financial Transaction Tax (\" French FTT\") described below, the sale of shares is subject to a transfer tax at the proportional rate of 0.1% based on the higher of sale price or fair market value of the shares, subject to certain exceptions provided for by II of Article 726 of the French Tax Code. Pursuant to Article 1712 of the French Tax Code, the registration tax that would be due if the sale were recorded in a deed (and not subject to the French FTT) will be borne by the transferee (unless otherwise contractually stipulated). However, by virtue of Articles 1705 et seq. of the French Tax Code, all parties to the deed will be jointly and severally liable to the tax authorities for the payment of this tax. Pursuant to Article 235 ter ZD of the French Tax Code, subject to certain exceptions, the French FTT applies at a rate of 0.3% to any acquisition for consideration of an equity security or similar security, if (i) this security is listed on a regulated market, (ii) its acquisition gives rise to a transfer of ownership, and (iii) this security is issued by a French company whose market capitalization exceeds one billion euros as of December 1, of the year preceding the taxation year. The French FTT is collected by the financial services provider, except where the acquisition took place without the assistance of a financial services provider, in which case the tax is liquidated and due by the establishment acting as custodian ( teneur de comptes-conservateur ), within the meaning of 1 of Article L. 321-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code. Acquisitions of equity or similar securities subject to the French FTT are exempt from registration tax provided for by Article 726 of the French Tax Code. Any application of the French FTT will depend on whether the Company's market capitalization exceeds \u20ac1 billion as of December 1, 2022. A list of the companies falling within the scope of the French FTT is published every year. The Company will be included within the scope of such a list if its market capitalization exceeds \u20ac1 billion. Prospective holders of the EUROAPI shares should consult their own tax advisors as to the potential consequences of such French FTT. Estate and gift tax Shares issued by French companies acquired through inheritance or gift by a person who is not a resident of France fall within the scope of French inheritance tax and gift taxes and, where applicable, are subject thereto. The tax applies without regard to the tax residence of the transferor. France has signed with a certain number of jurisdictions agreements aimed at avoiding double taxation in respect of inheritance and gifts. Under the terms of such treaties, persons residing in jurisdictions parties thereto may, subject to certain conditions, be exempt from inheritance and gift taxes or obtain a tax credit. Under the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Estates, Inheritances and Gifts, dated November 24, 1978, as amended a transfer of shares by gift or by reason of the death of an individual who is domiciled in, or a citizen of, the United States will not be subject to French gift or inheritance tax, so long as the donor or decedent was not domiciled in France at the time of making the gift or at the time of his or her death, and the shares were not used or held for use in the conduct of a business or profession through a permanent establishment or fixed base in France. U.S. Holders should consult their own advisors concerning their liability for inheritance and gift taxes on shares of EUROAPI they may own, and the conditions under which they may be entitled to tax exemptions or a tax credit as a result of tax treaties concluded with France. 26 Real estate wealth tax (imp\u00f4t sur la fortune immobili\u00e8re or IFI) Real estate wealth tax applies to individuals owning real estate assets (owned directly or indirectly through - inter alia - property companies or property investm ent funds) when their overall net value (i.e., after deduction of qualifying liabilities) exceeds a \u20ac1.3 million threshold (Articles 964 and 965 of the French Tax Code). Real estate wealth tax is calculated per household. Shares held by individuals in a company are subject to IFI for the fraction of their value representing real estate assets held directly or indirectly by the company. However, exceptions apply inter alia (i) to real estate assets assigned to an operational activity and (ii) to minority stakes in companies. (i) Real estate assets allocated to an operational activity: Shares held in a company that uses real estate assets allocated to its operational activities are not subject to French IFI. (ii) Minority stake: Shares held directly or indirectly, for less than 10% of the capital and voting rights in companies (including listed ones) owning real estate assets but engaged in industrial, commercial, craft, agricultural or liberal activity (operational company) are in principle not subject to IFI (BOI-PAT-IFI-20-20-20-20- 20180608). Under the Treaty, French real estate wealth tax will not generally apply to shares that are held by U.S. Holders who (i) own, alone or with related persons, directly or indirectly, Company's shares which give rise to less than 25% of the rights in the Company's earnings, and (ii) do not own their shares in connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed base through which the U.S. Holder carries on business or performs personal services in France. Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential tax consequences applicable to their personal situation. Certain U.S. federal income tax consequences The following discussion describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders (as defined below) under present law of the Dividend in Kind and of the ownership and disposition of the distributed shares of EUROAPI (the \" EUROAPI Shares \"). This summary applies only to U.S. Holders that hold their shares of Sanofi (the \" Sanofi Shares \") and EUROAPI Shares as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (as defined below) and have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. This discussion is based on the tax laws of the United States as in effect on the date of this Information Statement, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \" U.S. Internal Revenue Code \"), and U.S. Treasury regulations in effect or, in some cases, proposed, as of the date of this Information Statement, as well as judicial and administrative interpretations thereof available on or before such date. All of the foregoing authorities are subject to change, and any such change could apply retroactively and could affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below. The statements in this Information Statement are not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") or any court, and thus there can be no assurance that the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed below will not be challenged by the IRS or will be sustained by a court if challenged by the IRS. Furthermore, this summary does not address any estate or gift tax consequences, alternative 27 minimum tax or any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences or any other tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences. The following discussion does not describe all the tax consequences that may be relevant to any particular investor or to persons in special tax situations such as: banks and certain other financial institutions; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; insurance companies; traders that elect to mark to tax-exempt entities; persons holding their Sanofi Shares or EUROAPI Shares in individual retirement accounts or other tax deferred accounts; U.S. expatriates; persons holding their Sanofi Shares or EUROAPI Shares as part of a straddle, hedging, constructive sale, conversion or integrated transaction; persons that actually or constructively own 10% or more of EUROAPI's stock by vote or value; persons that are subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Sanofi Shares or EUROAPI Shares being taken into account; persons that are resident or ordinarily resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States; persons who acquired their Sanofi Shares or EUROAPI Shares pursuant to the exercise of any employee share option or otherwise as compensation; or partnerships and persons holding their Sanofi Shares or EUROAPI Shares through partnerships or other pass-through entities. PROSPECTIVE HOLDERS OF EUROAPI SHARES ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL TAX RULES TO THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AS WELL AS THE STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE DIVIDEND IN KIND AND THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE EUROAPI SHARES. As used herein, the term \" U.S. Holder \" means a beneficial owner of Sanofi Shares or EUROAPI Shares that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as: an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 28 an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or a trust that (1) is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more U.S. persons or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. The tax treatment of a partner in an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds the Sanofi Shares or EUROAPI Shares generally will depend on such partner's status and the activities of the partnership. A U.S. Holder that is a partner in such partnership should consult its tax advisor. U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Dividend in Kind For U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the Dividend in Kind will not be eligible for treatment as a tax-free distribution. Accordingly, the Dividend in Kind will be treated as a taxable distribution by Sanofi to each Sanofi shareholder in an amount equal to the fair market value of the EUROAPI shares received by such shareholder (including any fractional share for which the shareholder receives cash and any amount withheld on account of any applicable withholding taxes), as determined in U.S. dollars as of the date of the distribution (the \"Distribution Amount\"). The Distribution Amount generally will be includible as dividend income in a U.S. Holder's gross income in the year received, to the extent such Distribution Amount is paid out of the Sanofi's current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Because Sanofi does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, a U.S. Holder should expect the entirety of the Distribution Amount to be reported as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This dividend will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction allowed to U.S. corporations with respect to divid ends received from other U.S. corporations. Subject to certain holding period requirements and other limitati ons, dividends received from a \"qualified foreign corporation\" by a non-corporate U.S. Holder, including an individual, may be eligible for preferential rates of taxation if the dividends are \"qualified dividend income\" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A non- U.S. corporation generally will be a qualified foreign corporation if (1) it is eligible for the benefits of a qualifying income tax treaty with the United States that includes an exchange of information program and (2) the corporation is not a PFIC (as defined below) for either the taxable year in which the dividend was paid or the preceding taxable year. The U.S. Treasury has determined that the Treaty (as defined above) is a qualifying treaty for these purposes. In addition, Sanofi does not believe it was a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2021, and does not expect to be treated as a PFIC for the current taxable year, or in the foreseeable future. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential treatment of the Distribution Amount as qualified dividend income. The Distribution Amount will constitute foreign source income for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Subject to certain complex conditions and limitations, taxes withheld, if any, on the Distribution Amount may be eligible for credit against a U.S. Holder's federal income tax liability. If a refund of the tax withheld is available under the laws of France, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for such credit against a U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability (and will not be eligible for the deduction against U.S. federal taxable income). The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. For this purpose, the Distribution Amount with respect to the EUROAPI Shares will generally constitute \"passive category income.\" The rules relating to the determination of the U.S. foreign tax credit are complex, and U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit in their particular circumstances and the possibility of claiming a deduction (in lieu of the foreign tax credit) for any foreign taxes paid or withheld. 29 A U.S. Holder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of EUROAPI should be treated as having received the fractional share as part of the Distribution and then having sold such fractional share for cash. Because a U.S. Holder's basis in the fractional EUROAPI share deemed received will equal the fair market value of such fractional share on the date of distribution, a U.S. Holder should generally not recognize additional gain or loss on the deemed sale of a fractional shares described in the preceding sentence. U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of the EUROAPI Share Dividends and other distributions on EUROAPI Shares Subject to the passive foreign investment company considerations discussed below, the gross amount of distributions made by EUROAPI with respect to the EUROAPI Shares (including the amount of any non- U.S. taxes withheld therefrom, if any) generally will be includible as dividend income in a U.S. Holder's gross income in the year received, to the extent such distributions are paid out of EUROAPI's current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Because EUROAPI does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, a U.S. Holder should expect all cash distributions generally will be reported as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction allowed to U.S. corporations with respect to dividends received from other U.S. corporations. Subject to certain holding period requirements and other limitations, dividends received from a \"qualified foreign corporation\" by a non-corporate U.S. Holder, including an individual, may be eligible for preferential rates of taxation if the dividends are \"qualified dividend income\" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A non-U.S. corporation generally will be a qualified foreign corporation if (1) it is eligible for the benefits of a qualifying income tax treaty with the United States that includes an exchange of information program and (2) the corporation is not a PFIC (as defined below) for either the taxable year in which the dividend was paid or the preceding taxable year. The U.S. Treasury has determined that the Treaty (as defined above) is a qualifying treaty for these purposes. In addition, as discussed below, EUROAPI does not believe it was a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2021, and does not expect to be treated as a PFIC for the current taxable year, or in the foreseeable future. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential treatment of dividends received with respect to the EUROAPI Shares as qualified dividend income. The amount of any distribution paid in foreign currency will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of such currency, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such distribution is actually or constructively received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at that time. If dividends received in foreign currency are converted into U.S. dollars on the day they are received, the U.S. Holder generally will not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income. If it is not converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, such U.S. Holder will have a basis in such foreign currency equal to the U.S. dollar value on the date of receipt. Any gain or loss on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of such foreign currency generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to such U.S. Holder and generally will be income or loss from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Dividends on the EUROAPI Shares generally will constitute foreign source income for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Subject to certain complex conditi ons and limitations, taxes withheld, if any, on any distributions on the EUROAPI Shares may be eligible for credit against a U.S. Holder's federal income tax liability. If a refund of the tax withheld is available under the laws of France, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for such credit against a U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability (and will not be eligible for the deduction against U.S. federal taxable income). The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. For this purpose, dividends with respect to the EUROAPI Shares will generally constitute \"passive category 30 income.\" The rules relating to the determination of the U.S. foreign tax credit are complex, and U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit in their particular circumstances and the possibility of claiming a deduction (in lieu of the foreign tax credit) for any foreign taxes paid or withheld. Sale or other taxable disposition of EUROAPI Shares Subject to the passive foreign investment company considerations discussed below, upon a sale or other taxable disposition of the EUROAPI Shares, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in such EUROAPI Shares. A U.S. holder's initial tax basis in the EUROAPI Shares will generally equal their U.S. dollar value on the date of the Dividend in Kind, and its holding period for the EUROAPI Shares will generally begin the day after such distribution. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder upon a sale or other taxable disposition generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period in the EUROAPI Shares exceeds one year. Non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on long-term capital gain at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Gain or loss, if any, realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of the EUROAPI Shares generally will be treated as U.S. source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of French taxes to a disposition of ordinary EUROAPI Shares and whether any such withholding or income tax could be eligible for the U.S. foreign tax credit. In addition, even if such tax is eligible for the U.S. federal tax credit, because capital gains on a disposition of the EUROAPI Shares by a U.S. Holder generally will be treated as U.S. source, the use of such U.S. foreign tax credit relating to French withholding taxes imposed with respect to such disposition of the EUROAPI Shares, if any, may be limited. If the consideration received upon the sale or other disposition of the EUROAPI Shares is paid in foreign currency, the amount realized will be the U.S. dollar value of the payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of the taxable disposition. If the EUROAPI Shares are treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a cash basis U.S. Holder or an accrual basis U.S. Holder who has made a special election (which must be applied consistently from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized in foreign currency by translating the amount received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement and delivery date of the sale. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency gain or loss to the extent attributable to the difference between the exchange rates on the trade date and the settlement and delivery date. Such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Passive foreign investment company considerations EUROAPI will be a passive foreign investment company (a \" PFIC \") for any taxable year if either: (a) at least 75% of its gross income is \"passive income\" for purposes of the PFIC rules or (b) at least 50% of the value of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, EUROAPI will be treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets and earning its proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, 25% or more (by value) of the stock. Passive income generally includes interest, dividends, royalties and gains from transactions in commodities, and rents. Based upon EUROAPI's estimated gross income, the average value of EUROAPI's gross assets, and the nature of EUROAPI's business, EUROAPI does not believe it was a PFIC for the taxable year ended 31 December 31, 2021, and does not expect to be treated as a PFIC for the current taxable year, or in the foreseeable future. The determination of PFIC status is a factual determination that is made annually after the close of the taxable year that will depend on, among other things, the composition of the income and assets, and the market value of the EUROAPI Shares and assets, of EUROAPI and its subsidiaries. There can be no assurance, however, that EUROAPI will not be treated as a PFIC for any particular taxable year. If EUROAPI is treated as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder who owns the EUROAPI Shares will generally be subject to adverse tax treatment. Except to the extent the U.S. Holder makes a timely and effective \"qualified electing fund\" election or ''mark-to-market'' election, gain recognized on a disposition (including, under certain circumstances, a pledge) of the EUROAPI Shares, by the U.S. Holder will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder's holding period for the EUROAPI Shares. The amounts allocated to the taxable year of disposition will be taxed as ordinary income. The amounts allocated to each other taxable year will generally be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for that taxable year for individuals or corporations, as applicable, and an interest charge will be imposed on the resulting tax liability. The total amount of gain or loss will equal the difference between the U.S. Holder's tax basis in the EUROAPI Shares disposed of and the amount realized on disposition, in each case as determined in U.S. dollars. To the extent that any distribution received by a U.S. Holder on the EUROAPI Shares exceeds 125% of the average of the annual distributions on the EUROAPI Shares received during the preceding three years or the U.S. Holder's holding period, whichever is shorter (\"excess distributions\"), the distribution will be subject to taxation in the same manner as gain as described in the preceding paragraph (except that distributions will be treated as foreign source income as described under ''\u2014 Dividends and other distributions on EUROAPI Shares \" above). If EUROAPI is treated as a PFIC with respect to a U.S. Holder for any taxable year, certain of EUROAPI's subsidiaries may also be treated as PFICs, the U.S. Holder would be deemed to own such lower-tier PFIC indirectly and the U.S. Holder may be subject to the tax consequences described above with respect to the EUROAPI Shares of such lower-tier PFIC. If EUROAPI were a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds the EUROAPI S hares, EUROAPI will generally continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to the U.S. Holder for all succeeding years during which the U.S. Holder holds the EUROAPI Shares, even if EUROAPI ceases to meet the threshold requirements for PFIC status, unless EUROAPI ceases to be a PFIC and a U.S. Holder makes a special election with respect to the EUROAPI Shares. If a U.S. Holder owns the EUROAP I Shares during any year in which EUROAPI is a PFIC, the U.S. Holder generally must file annual reports on an IRS form 8621, generally with the U.S. Holder's federal income tax return for that year. A failure to comply with such filing requirements could result in the imposition of penalties and the extension of the statute of limitations with respect to U.S. federal income tax. Prospective holders of EUROAPI Shares should consul t their tax advisers regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to acquiring EUROAPI Shares, and the advisability of making a \"qualified electing fund\" election or a mark-to-market election, if available. Medicare Tax Certain U.S. holders that are individuals, estates or trusts are subject to a 3.8% tax on all or a portion of their \"net investment income,\" which may include all or a portion of the Distribution Amount with respect to the Dividend in Kind and the dividend income and net gains from their EUROAPI Shares. Each U.S. holder that is an individual, estate or trust is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the applicability of 32 the Medicare tax to the Dividend in Kind and income and gains in respect of an investment in the EUROAPI Shares. Information reporting and backup withholding The Dividend in Kind and dividend payments with respect to EUROAPI Shares and proceeds from the sale, exchange or redemption of the EUROAPI Shares may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding. A U.S. Holder may be eligible for an exemption from backup withholding if the U.S. Holder furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes any other required certification or otherwise establishes an exempti on from backup withholding. U.S. Holders who are required to establish their exempt status may be required to provide such certification on IRS Form W-9. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the U.S. information reporting and backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, and such U.S. Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information. A holder that is not a U.S. Holder may be required to comply with certification and identification procedures in order to establish its exemption from information reporting and backup withholding. Additional information reporting requirements A U.S. Holder that is an individual may be subject to certain reporting obligations with respect to the EUROAPI Shares if the aggregate value of these and certain other \"specified foreign financial assets\" exceeds $50,000. If required, this disclosure is made by filing Form 8938 with the IRS. Significant penalties can apply if a U.S. Holder is required to make this disclosure and fail to do so. In addition, a U.S. Holder should consider the possible obligation to file online a FinCEN Form 114\u2014Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts Report, as a result of holding EUROAPI Shares in certain accounts. Holders are urged to consult their U.S. tax advisors with respect to these and other reporting requirements that may apply to their acquisition and ownership of EUROAPI Shares. THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMM ARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO PROSPECTI VE HOLDERS OF EUROAPI SHARES. EACH PROSPECTIVE HOLDER OF EUROAPI SHARES SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN EQUITY SHARES UNDER ITS OWN CIRCUMSTANCES. Certain Australian tax consequences The following is a general summary of certain Australian tax consequences of receiving the Distribution in Kind, and the acquisition, holding and disposal of the EUROAPI shares to be acquired in the Distribution in Kind, by holders of Sanofi shares who: (i) are resident for tax purposes only in Australia at all relevant times; (ii) who do not own their shares of EUROAPI in connection with a permanent establishment outside Australia; (iii) hold their Sanofi shares on capital account; 33 (iv) do not hold their Sanofi shares on trust and will not hold EUROAPI shares acquired in the Distribution in Kind in trust; (v) are not subject to the Taxation of Financial Arrangements provisions in the income tax law (\"Australian Holders \"). The following general summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to acquire, own or dispose of the EUROAPI shares. This summary is based on the Australian tax laws, the practice of the Australian Taxation Office (\" ATO \") and the applicable double taxation conventions or treaties with Australia, all as in force as at the date of this document. Australian tax laws can and do frequently change, possibly with retroactive effect. Neither Sanofi nor EUROAPI has sought a ruling or specific advice or guidance from the ATO in relation to the Distribution in Kind. The ATO or a court may take a position which differs from the statements in this summary. Investors should consult their own tax advisors in determining the tax consequences to them of receiving the Distribution in Kind, and of acquiring, holding and disposing shares of EUROAPI, to their particular situation. Australian tax laws contain specific rules relating to different types of taxpayers, such as trusts. Given the complex nature of these rules and the fact that their application varies depending on the status of the trusts and their beneficiaries, the following summary does not address the tax treatment of the Sanofi or EUROAPI shares held in a trust. If the Sanofi or EUROAPI shares are held in trust, the trustee and beneficiaries are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of the EUROAPI shares. Investors who are residents of Australia for tax purposes may have to comply with, or take steps to obtain benefits under, applicable tax laws of France (or another country) and, as the case may be, the applicable tax treaty entered into between Australia and such country. Australian resident shareholders should also consider the descriptions of the tax considerations in other countries outlined in this document and consult their own tax advisors to determine if they should or must take any action under the applicable tax laws of those other countries. Australian tax considerations relating to the Distribution in Kind Treatment of the Distribution in Kind as a dividend for tax purposes The Distribution in Kind should be treated as a dividend for Australian tax purposes and subject to tax at normal tax rates (plus the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge, if relevant). Australian Holders should include the value of the Distribution in Kind they receive (including any cash received in respect of the Distribution in Kind) in their assessable income for the income year in which they receive the Distribution in Kind. As this value may be denominated in Euros, it will need to be converted into Australian dollars to determine the amount of assessable income to be included. The tax consequences of any foreign exchange gains or losses on conversion of any cash received in respect of the Distribution in Kind should also be considered by an Australian Holder. Demerger relief not available In certain circumstances, the distribution of shares in an entity by a parent company to the parent company's shareholders can be subject to tax relief for \"demergers\". It is considered that the Distribution in Kind is not likely to satisfy all of the requirem ents necessary for demerger relief to apply. However, neither Sanofi nor EUROAPI has sought any ruling or other confirmation from the ATO on this. 34 Double tax treaty with France As noted above under the heading \"Certain French tax considerations\", the Distribution in Kind will be subject to French withholding tax for shareholders who are not domiciled or resident in France for tax purposes. Australia has entered into a double tax treaty with France which may affect the amount or rate of French withholding tax applicable to Australian Holders who are entitled to the benefit of that treaty. For instance, under the treaty, the rate of tax applicable to dividends paid by a French company to an Australian-resident shareholder who is beneficially entitled to the dividend is limited to 15%. A lower rate may apply in certain circumstances, such as where the shareholder is a company which directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividend. Australian Holders should consult their tax advisor to determine whether they are entitled to the benefit of the double tax treaty, the appropriate rate of tax which is relevant to their circumstances, and any steps that the Australian Holder could or should take to claim the benefits of that treaty. Foreign tax offsets Australian Holders may be entitled to a foreign tax offset for the amount of foreign tax that they pay in respect of the Distribution in Kind, or that is withheld from the Distribution in Kind. If available, a foreign tax offset would reduce the amount of Australian tax payable in respect of the Distribution in Kind. If a foreign tax offset is available, an Australian Holder would also need to include the amount of the foreign tax paid or withheld from the Distribution in Kind in their assessable income. As the relevant amount may be denominated in Euros, it will need to be converted into Australian dollars. Effect of the Distribution in Kind on Sanofi shares The Distribution in Kind should not affect the tax attributes of Sanofi shares held by an Australian Holder. In particular, the Distribution in Kind should not be regarded as a disposal or other taxable event for Australian capital gains tax purposes in respect of the Sanofi shares, and should not affect the cost base of the Sanofi shares held by an Australian Holder. The Distribution in Kind may affect the value of the Sanofi shares held by an Australian Holder and, accordingly, affect any disposal or dealing in those shares, including the Australian tax consequences of such disposal or dealing. Australian tax considerations relating to acquiring, holding and disposing of EUROAPI shares Employee share scheme considerations The EUROAPI shares should be considered separate assets for tax purposes from the Sanofi shares held by an Australian Holder and should be taken to have separate attributes for tax purposes. The employee share scheme provisions in the income tax laws should not apply to the EUROAPI shares acquired under the Distribution in Kind by an Australian Holder who holds their Sanofi shares under the employee share scheme provisions. The applicati on of the employee share scheme provisions (including any deferred taxing point) to an Australian Holder's Sanofi shares should not be affected by the Distribution in Kind. Australian Holders who hold their Sanofi shares under the employee share scheme provisions in the income tax laws should consult their tax advisor in relation to the application of those provisions to their particular circumstances. 35 Capital gains tax (\"CGT\") and other tax considerations The EUROAPI shares should be considered separate assets for tax purposes from the Sanofi shares held by an Australian Holder and should be taken to have separate attributes for tax purposes. For CGT purposes, Australian Holders should be taken to have acquired EUROAPI shares at the time they receive them under the Distribution in Kind. The cost base of the EUROAPI shares in the hands of an Australian Holder should include the value of those shares. Tax may be payable by an Australian Holder on disposing of, or otherwise dealing in, their EUROAPI shares. The Australian and foreign tax consequences for an Australian Holder of disposing of, or otherwise dealing with, the EUROAPI shares will need to be considered by each Australian Holder at the time of, and with regard to the particular circumstances of, the relevant disposal or dealing. Australian Holders should consult with their tax advisor if they intend to dispose of or otherwise deal with their EUROAPI shares. Considerations in relation to dividends and other payments An Australian Holder may need to include in their assessable income any dividends received on their EUROAPI shares. An Australian Holder may be entitled to a foreign tax offset for foreign tax paid or withheld from any such dividend. There may also be tax consequences for an Australian Holder who receives other payments on or under their EUROAPI shares. Australian Holders should consult their tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of any payment or distribution received on their EUROAPI shares, including any Australian or foreign tax consequences, whether they are entitled to the benefit of the double tax treaty which might affect the tax payable on the payment or distribution, and any steps that the Australian Holder could or should take to claim the benefits of that treaty. 36 Annex A ENGLISH LANGUAGE TRANSLATION FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY This document is an unofficial translation of the French language prospectus that received from the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (the \" AMF \") approval number 22-076 on March 31, 2022 (the \"French Prospectus \").

A glossary that defines certain terms used in the Prospectus is provided in Chapter 25 \" Glossary \". The market and competitive environment The Prospectus contains information about the Group's markets and competitive positions, including information on the size of these markets and the Gr oup's market share. This information comes from data, statistics, publications, surveys, studies and reports from third-party organizations and professional organizations and/or has been prepared by the Comp any on the basis of its own estimates and analyses, research, surveys and information coming from these third-party and professional organizations, including IQVIA, PharmaCompass and Boston Consulting Group (which provided the Group with consulting services, including the conduct of r esearch and studies), or from data published by competitors, suppliers and customers of the Group (see Section 1.5 \" Third-party information \" of the Prospectus). To the Company's knowledge, such in formation has been accurately reproduced, and no material fact that would make this information in accurate or misleading has been omitted. The Company cannot guarantee that a third party using different me thods to collect, analyze or calculate data on its business segment would obtain the same results. Certain information contained in the Prospectus is public information that the Company considers to be reliable, but that has not been verified by an i ndependent expert. The Compa ny and its advisors cannot guarantee that a third party using different methods to collect, analyze or calculate data on its business segment would obtain the same results. The Comp any makes no commitment and offers no guarantee as to the accuracy of this information. It is possible that this informati on is erroneous or no longer up to date. The Group makes no commitment to update this in formation, except if requi red by applicable legal or regulatory obligations. 8Forward-looking information The Prospectus contains information on the Gr oup's outlook and areas for development. This information is sometimes identified by the use of the future tense, conditional language or forward- looking terms, such applicable, the negative form of these same terms, or any other variant or similar term inology. This information is not hi storical data and should not be interpreted as a guarantee that the facts or data set out will occur. This information is based on data, assumptions and estimates considered reasonable by the Company. It could change or be modified due to the uncertainties related, for example, to the economic, financial, competitive and regulatory environment. In addition, the materializati on of certain risks described in Chapter 3 \" Risk factors relating to the issuer \" and Section 22.2 \" Risks relating to the Company's shares \" of the Prospectus could have an impact on the Group's reputation, activiti es, financial situation and results and/or its ability to achieve its objectives. The reader's attention is drawn to the fact that the achievement of these objectives and forward-looking statements and information on objectives may be a ffected by known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the Group's futu re results, performance and achievements to differ significantly from those expressed or implied. Ther efore, the Group cannot anticipate all the risks, uncertainties or other factors likely to affect its business, their potential impact on its business or the extent to which the materialization of a risk or co mbination of risks could produce significantly different results from those mentioned in any forward-looking in formation. It should be noted that none of this forward-looking information constitutes a guarantee of actual results.

Moreover, the Prospectus provides performance indi cators for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 restated to give investors a better unde rstanding of the Group's new business model effective as of the date of the Prospectus and its assu mption of autonomy from the Sanofi group. The Group presents these performance indicators, restated if app licable, to give investors a better understanding of the changes in its results and the elements that ma y influence its future results. These indicators and restatements must be used only as instruments of an alysis and must not be considered as substitutes for the indicators defined by IFRS accounting standards or a faithful image of p ast accounts.

Risk factors Investors are encouraged to read Chapter 3 \" Risk factors relating to the issuer \" and Section 22.2 \" Risks relating to the Company's shares \" of the Prospectus carefully before making any investment decision. The materialization of all or some of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group's reputation, business, financial position, results, or ou tlook and/or on its ability to achieve its objectives and on the market price of the Company's shares on ce they are admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. In addition, other risks that have not yet been identified or that are considered insignificant by the Group as of the date of the Prospe ctus could also have a material adverse effect. 9Rounding Certain calculated figures (including data expressed in thousands or millions) and percentages presented in the Prospectus have been rou nded.

Section 2 - Key information about the issuer 2.1 Who is the issuer of the securities? - Company name: EUROAPI. - Registered office: 15 rue Traversi\u00e8re, 75012 Paris, - Legal form: simplified joint-stock ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions simplifi\u00e9e ). - Applicable law: French law. - Country of origin: France. Main activities The Group develops, manufactures, market s and distributes active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and intermediates used in the formulation of medicines for human and veterinary use, both from originators and generics, including all types of molecules in the API market: small molecules (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation and HP-APIs) and large molecules (suc h as peptides and oligonucleotides). As of December 31, 2021, the Group markets its APIs to approxi mately 530 customers in more than 80 countries. Its customer base includes the majority of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies (including Sanofi, Boehringer Ingelheim and Alfasigma), generic drug manufacturers (Teva), and an imal health products manuf acturers (MSD Animal H ealth, Ceva), consumer health and products companies (DSM), biotech co mpanies (Mithra, SQY Therapeu tics, Rancho Santa Fe and NH Theraguix), CDMOs2 (Catalent) and distribution companies. The Gr oup, which generated \u20ac902.2 million in restated revenue and \u20ac892.8 million in consolidat ed revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, estimates that, in terms of revenue, it is the world's leading manufacturer of small mol ecules and the world's second-la rgest manufacturer of APIs (including small molecules and large molecules), as well as th e seventh-largest manufacturer in the global CDMO (Contract Development & Manufacturing Organization) market in 2020.3 The Group is the result of a reorganization of part of th e Sanofi group's activities in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of APIs. With more than 150 years of experience in the API mark et, the Group is composed of six manufacturing sites and development cente rs equipped with state-of-t he-art technology, all located in Europe (Vertolaye and Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf in France, Frankfurt in Germany, Ujpest in Hungary, Brindisi in Italy and Haverhill in the United Kin gdom), and a custome r-oriented or ganization res ponsible for the commercialization and marketin g of its 2 Refers to the external manufacture for a customer that owns the intellectual property of the APIs manufactured, starting with a phase to develop the production process by the Group or a transfer of the production process to the Gr oup (Contract Development and M anufacturing Organization). 3 Source : Company's estimate based on third-party market resear ch conducted using the annual reports published by the main industrial players in the APIs sector, public databases (including Capital IQ and Orbis) as well as interviews with market expe rts. 11 products, with a worldwide reach. As of December 31, 2021, the Group empl oys around 3,350 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). The Group is engaged in the merchant ma rket for APIs, corresponding to the devel opment and production of APIs intended for sale to third parties. The Group offers its customers (i) a diversified portfolio of about 165 APIs from its third-pa rty sales business, for which the intellectual property is owned by the Group or licensed by the Group and/or is subject to a distribution agreement (the \"API Solutions\" business), and (ii) development and/or manuf acturing services for about 35 APIs, as a CDMO, for which the intellectual property is owned by the Group's custom ers (the \"CDMO\" (Contract Development & Manufacturing Organization) activities). In addition to the sale and development of APIs, the Gr oup also offers a range of high value- added services allowing the Group to meet customers' business needs and to support them in their regulatory filings. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the API Solutions business and the CDMO ac tivities respectively accounted for 75.1% and 24.9% of the Group's consolidated revenue. The Company's strategy is focused on reinforcing its status as a key player in the sm all molecules market, both by accelerating the growth of the revenue of its existing API po rtfolio in its API Solutions business and by encouraging the growing exposure of its portfolio to its CDMO activities, especially by continuing to invest in technology and innovation, as well as the development of its production capacities, and it aims to improve the Group's operating margin, continue efforts to improve its cash position and engage in a strong e nvironmental and societal commitment by capitalizing mainly on the strong legacy of Sanofi. During the year ended De cember 31, 2021, the Group's CDMO activities experienced an upturn, with 23 contracts signed, about 35% of which were with new customers. Since the beginning of 2022, the Group has won three other projects.

This business model gives rise to di fferences with the historical business relationships between the Group and the entities of th e Sanofi group, which have a significant effect on the Group's key financial indicators. 12 (\u20ac million unless otherwise indicated) Year ended December 31, 2021 Year ended December 31, 2020 Year ended December 31, 2019 Consolidated revenue by fl ow and by nature of sales Revenue from than Sanofi 485.9 54.4% consolidated revenue by flow and by nature of sales(1) Restated revenue from customers other than Sanofi 459.0 9.6% Restated gross profit(1) 153.3 149.8 EBITDA(3) 63.2 6.3% Restated EBITDA(1) (3) 102.8 101.8 8.4% Core EBITDA(4) 72.2 7.8% Restated core EBITDA(1) (4) 110.6 107.7 of restated revenue 12.3% FCF conversion(1)(5) 72.1% 24.8% - (1) The restated financial indicators for the Group for the yea rs ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, incorporate the effects of EUROAPI's new business model resulting from the PriorReorganization Transactions. (2) Sales of EUROAPI to Sanofi are fully accounted for in the Eur opean area. Sales to other custom ers are broken down by geographi cal area. Note C.3.2 of the financial statements shows the share of revenue generated in France. (3) EBITDA corresponds to operating income (lo ss) restated for depreciation and amortiza tion (Note B.7 of the financial statements ) and net impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Note B.8 of the financial statements). (4) Core EBITDA is a monitoring indicator for the underlying perform ance of the business after restatement for certain expenses an d/or income that do not reflect the Group's operating performance. Core EBITDA thus corresponds to EBITDA restated for restructuring cost s and similar items (excluding depreciation and write-downs), allocations net of reversals of unutilized provisions for environmental risks, and other items not representative of the Group' s current operating performance or related to the effects of acquisitions or disposals. EUROAPI considers that the exclusion of these items allows investors to better understand the unde rlying economic performance o f the Group, considering that the exclusion of these items better reflects the current operating performance of the company. Restructur ing costs and similar items are detailed in N ote D.18 of the Group financial statements, and allocations net of reversals of unutilized provisions for environmental risks in Note D.10. (5) Core FCF conversion corresponds to the ratio between (i) cash flow generated by (used in) operating activities less \"acquisiti ons of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\" (see statement of cash flow in the financial statements ), and adjusted for \"net change in other current assets and othe r current liabilities\", \"current taxes\" (see Note D.20 to the financial statements) and cash inflows and outflows relating to Core EBITDA restatements (thi s involves restructuring and s imilar costs, and expenses relating to environmental provisions for historical pe riods), and (ii) Core EBITDA. On February 22, 2022, the Group entered into a revolving cred it facility agreement (the \"RCF Loan Agreement\") for an amount of \u20ac451 million, which may be drawn down as of the init ial listing of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (\"Euronext Paris\"). On February 23, 2022, the Company carried out a \u20ac83,179,0 00 capital increase, fully s ubscribed by Sanofi Aventis Participations and paid for in cash at a unit subscription price of \u20ac20.79. This pr ice is not indicative of the market price of the Com pany's shares followin g their admission to tradin g on Euronext Paris. 13 2022 outlook For the year ending December 31, 2022, the Group expects: - consolidated revenue of approximately \u20ac1 billion, including 25% to 30% in the CDMO activities, and a decreased dependence on Sanofi in terms of percentage of revenue; - a Core EBITDA margin equal to or greater than 14%. The outlook for the year ending December 31, 2022, is based on several assumptions, including an uneven distribution of revenue between the first and second half of the year endi ng December 31, 2022, and within each period, with a heavier distribution in the second half. The Group is also targeting a ratio of capital expenditures to revenue of around 12% in 2022. The Company does not expect to distribute dividends for th e year ended December 31, 2021. 2022-2025 objectives The Group's objectives for the 2022-2025 period include: - reaching an average annual growth rate in its revenue, on the basis of the restated revenue recorded over financial year 2021, of between 6% and 7% for the 2021-2025 period; - generating approximately 35% of its revenue from the CDMO activities by 2025 due to this activity having greater than market growth through 2025; and - reducing the relative weight of Sanofi in the Group's tota l revenue with the goal of reducing it to around 30% to 35% of its consolidated revenue by 2025, primarily through grea ter-than-market growth in sales to other customers. An inventory reduction program, which has been initiated, will ha ve the effect of lowering inventories to a level equivalent to approximately five months' revenue in 2025, but will have a negative impact on the short-term margin. The Group also aims to achieve a Core EBITDA margin (whi ch corresponds to the ratio of Core EBITDA to revenue) of more than 20% by 2025 (compared to a rest ated Core EBITDA margin of 12.3% in 2021), primarily driven by (a) a better absorption of the fixed cost structure of its production costs through increased volu mes to customers other than Sanofi, (b) a positive product mix resulting from the increase (i) in its pres ence in the most differentiated and most complex APIs and (ii) the relative weight of CDMO activiti es in the Group's total revenue and (c) th e optimization of its sales costs with a reduction on the order of 2% per year by 2025. The Group also intends to maintain a ratio of net financial debt/Core EBITDA of less than or equal to a factor of three over the period from 2022 to 2025. Over the 2022-2025 period, the Group intends to invest around \u20ac510 million, approximately 50% in performance and growth investments and around \u20ac230 million on Group sites in France. The Group is also targeting a ratio of capital expenditures to revenue of around 10% in 2025. In addition, the Group also aims to achieve a Core FCF conversion ratio of between 50% and 53% by 2025. 2.3 What risks are specific to the issuer?

RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE ISSUER Investors are encouraged to review all of the inform ation contained in this Prospectus, including the risk factors described below. These risks were iden tified and assessed using a risk mapping framework developed and reviewed at Group leve l in 2021. As of the date of the Prospectus, these risks are those the Company considers to be likely to have a ma terial adverse effect on the Group or its business, financial position, results or outlook , and to be important when making an investment decision. In such an event, the market price of the Company's shares could decline and the investor could lose all or part of the sums invested in the Compa ny's shares. Nevertheless, investors are reminded that the list of risks presented in this Chapter 3 \" Risk factors relating to the issuer \" of the Prospectus is not exhaustive and that other risks may exist or occur. These include ri sks that are currently unknown or whose occurrence is not considered, as of the date of the Prospectus, to be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Group or its business, financial position, results or outlook or the Company's share price. In the context of the provisions of Article 16 of Re gulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as amended, the main risks presente d in this chapter are the ones that may, as of the date of the Prospectus, affect the business, financial position and reput ation, results or outlook of the Group, as identified in particular in the context of the development of the mapping of the Group's major risks, which assesses their net criticality, i.e., thei r severity and probability of occurrence, after taking into account the action plans put in place. The Compa ny has synthesized these risks into five categories presented below in no particular or der of importance. Within each risk category mentioned below, the risk factors that the Company considers to be the mo st significant as of the date of the Prospectus are marked with an asterisk (*) and listed first. 3.1 Risks related to the Company's business sector 3.1.1 Risks related to the international nature of th e Group activities and to health crises and to geopolitical or macroeconomic instability* The Group sells and markets its active pharmaceutical i ngredients (APIs) in more than 80 countries. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Group ge nerated 82.5% of its c onsolidated in Europe,4 Asia-Pacific, 6.5% in North Ameri ca and 0.8% in the rest of the world. The international nature of its business exposes it to the di rect and indirect consequences of health crises, epidemics or pandemics and changes or geopolitical or macroeconomic crises such as trade conflicts, embargoes and sudden changes in customs duties or armed conflicts (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine). A health crisis or pandemic (such as the COVI D-19 pandemic) may expose the Group to a slowdown or temporary manufacturing suspension of its produc ts, in particular in the event of a significant reduction in its workforce as a result of a change in the health and safety rules in the production sites, which could lead to a disruption of the production cycl e. The maintenance or extension of the restrictive measures put in place by various countries to control the COVID-19 pandemic could also lead to delays or disruptions in production and interruptions in the Group's supply chain (see Sections 3.2.1 \" Risks related to the operation of industrial sites \" and 3.2.2 \" Risks related to supply difficulties, raw material and energy costs, and relationships with certain suppliers and subcontractors \" of the Prospectus). The measures which have been impl emented in some countries to restri ct access to local inventories of certain Group products may also have a negative impact on the Group's revenue. For example, in Hungary, where the Group owns a site in Ujp est that produces hydroxychloroquine, the local government introduced measures in March 2020 to tempor arily prohibit the export of this molecule, as well as certain medicines containing this API, to cer tain countries. These restrictions had an impact on 4 The Group's sales with the Sanofi group are fully acc ounted for in France, regardless of the country of destination of the products, while sales to Group custom ers other than Sanofi are allocated to the respective geographical areas. 22 the product supply chain and resulted in a temporary delay in sales while the therapeutic benefits of hydroxychloroquine in the COVID-19 pandemic was being evaluated. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have a negative impact on the business of the Group's customers, due in particular to a change in COVID-19-related patient therapeutic needs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the lack of transparency concerning the spread of the COVID- 19 pandemic, pharmaceutical companies built up inventories of APIs that were not fully used due to the decrease in certain infectious di seases resulting from governmental prot ective measures taken to contain the spread of the pandemic, as well as delays in cer tain treatments that were considered to be non- essential. For example, the Printinamyc in produced at the Vertolaye and Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf sites in France, which mainly affects certain bacterial diseases and pneumonias whose prevalence decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, saw a decrease in its sales of \u20ac17 million (37.6%), on a restated basis, during the year ended December 31, 2021. Pristinam ycin sales represented 3.4% of the Group's restated revenue for the year ended Decem ber 31, 2021. The Group estimated that the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a decrease in revenue of approximately \u20ac29 million for certain products compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Similarly, delays in cl inical trials by Group customers due to restrictions on access or use of the affected sites and/or delays or disruptions related to regulatory approvals could slow the demand for certain of the Group's produc ts, particularly in Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO5) activity, and therefore have a significant impact on the Group's revenue. Geopolitically, certain changes in international rela tions, including the introduction of new sanctions and/or restrictions on international trade, tensions or armed conflicts, particularly in Eastern Europe, such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and other emerging markets, may have a significant effect on the Group. In the event of a significant deterioration in econom ic conditions, particularly as a result of geopolitical instability, affecting the growth of the pharmaceu tical market in certain countries or emerging economies, the Group's business could be materially affected due to a decline in demand (see also Section 3.2.12 \" Risks relating to cost reduction initiatives and changes in the reimbursement practices of health administrative authorities \" of the Prospectus) The occurrence of such events and their consequences in one or more countries that are significant to the Group could have a negative impact on the Group's business, revenue, operating income and outlook. 3.1.2 Risks related to competition in the markets in which the Group operates The Group operates in an especially competitive market. Its main comp etitors are manufacturers of APIs as well as other players specialized in custom synt hesis of complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation, highly potent molecules (\"HP-APIs\") and large molecules. Revenue from the activity of selling APIs to third par ties for which the intellectual property is held by the Group or licensed by the Group and/or covered by a distribution agreement (the \"API Solutions\" activity) represented approximately 75.1% of the Gr oup's consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. The APIs marketed by the Group as part of its API Solutions business are subjected to intense competition from companie s operating in countries with low production costs, such as India and China. The Group is also exposed to competition from certain players who could reduce their prices and/or increase their production capacities to increase their market share, which could lead to an increase 5 An external manufacturing project for a customer that owns the inte llectual property of the API being manufactured, which starts with the development of the production process by the Group or the transfer of the production process to the Group, is considered as CDMO activity. Some of these projects do not include a development phase, and in such cas es the Group focuses on the manufacturing phase. The Group therefore describes this activity, which includes both types of business relationships, as \"CDMO\". 23 in supply and a decrease in price levels in the corresponding markets. Such aggressive business or pricing strategies by competitors coul d have the effect of reducing the Group's market share. As a result, the Group could be forced to lower its prices to main tain its market share, which could have a negative impact on its margin levels. It may also fail to anti cipate or adapt within a reasonable time to price decreases in some of its markets, which could result in loss of customers and lower revenue. Revenue from CDMO activities accounted for 24.9% of the Group's consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. As part of its CDMO activities and in view of the Group's ambition to reorient its portfolio toward CDMO activities, whic h represents a strategic market (see Section 6.4.2 \"Capitalize on innovation and development to accel erate the reorientation of the portfolio toward CDMO activities, particularly in the peptide and oligonucleotide segment \" of the Prospectus), the Group is exposed to strong competition to win development and marketing agreements for the more promising molecules. It may not be able to attract new custom ers, negotiate satisfactory contract terms, identify the right development programs or conduct process development and industrialization studies for new products targeted by the Group. Competitors of th e Group could also launch new products or services that offer better alternatives than those proposed by the Group. They could also seek to increase their production capacity, which could result in increased competition in the Group's markets and force the Group to lower its prices to retain its market share. For example, Cord enPharma completed the construction of a new production unit in July 2020 th at will enable it to manufacture batches of 400 kilograms of long and complex peptides, whereas Bachem announced a project in September 2021 to build a new peptide and oligonucleotide production site in Switzerland, and in August 2021, WuXi announced the construction of an API manufacturing a nd packaging site in Delaware (USA), which is scheduled to open in 2024. The occurrence or intens ification of such events could have a material adverse effect on the Group activiti es, financial position and results. In addition, the Group's business sector, which is s till composed of very diverse actors, has undergone a recent movement toward consolidation and integra tion, both in its API Solutions business and in its CDMO activities, which could reduce the Group's mark et share or opportunities. For example, Piramal acquired Hemmo Pharmaceuticals in April 2021 to add new capacities to its portfolio for the development and manufacture of synt hetic peptide APIs. After the sale by Eurazeo of its interest in Seqens to SK Capital partners, Seqens and Wavelength Pharmaceuticals were merged at the end of February 2022 to combine their product and tec hnology portfolios with their respective know-how in the development and production of APIs and inte rmediates, and in September 2021, PharmaZell announced the proposed acquisition of Novasep to co mbine their respective expertise in the manufacture of APIs and CDMO, while Mylan, a leading manufact urer of APIs, and Upjohn, a subsidiary of the Pfizer Group specializing in generic drugs, merged in November 2020. The continuation or intensification of this trend could increase compe tition or alter the competitive landscape of the Group's business sectors. If the Group were not able to take part in this trend, it coul d have a negative impact on its market share, revenue and/or profitability. In addition, some of the Group's competitors may, due to their size or current or future margins, have greater resources to invest in research into technol ogies to manufacture new, alternative or emerging APIs. The Group may not succeed in improving its margin s or in reaching margin levels equivalent to those of some of its competitor. Due to this diffe rence, the Group may not be in a position to generate sufficient profits and deliver its strategic plan, whic h could have an impact on its investment capacity. The occurrence of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial position and results. 3.2 Risks related to the Company's activities 3.2.1 Risks related to the operation of industrial sites* The Group operates industrial chemical and pharmaceutical production sites in several countries in Europe, of which five are classified as \"SEVESO\" hazardous sites (as defined by Directive 2012/18/EU 24 of 4 July 2012 on the control of major-accident h azards involving dangerous substances, the \"SEVESO Directive\"), including three classified as SEVESO \"hi gh-threshold\" sites in Vertolaye, Frankfurt as SEVESO \"low-threshol d\" SEVESO sites in Sain t-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf and Brindisi. In addition, in the course of the manufactur e of its products, it uses and has in the past used substances classified as hazardous to human health and/ or the environment, such as flammable solvents, hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid. The hazardous nature of the substances and mixtures used and manufactured and of the manufacturing processes may cause accidents or incidents (fire, pollution, accidental releases, etc.) that harm people, propert y or the environment both within the Group's facilities and in their vicinity or during the transport of the various finished products or raw materials. Such accidents or incidents may result in unforeseen bus iness interruptions, total or partial shutdown of facilities, where appropriate, or may cause environmen tal pollution or have consequences for the health of Group employees and/or third parties. Such accidents or incidents could expose the Group to administrative (including, if applicable, the withdrawal of operating licenses) and/or judicial procedures directed against the operating company and, where appropriate, its officers, initiated by the authorities and/or by potential victims (especially if such accidents or incidents occurred on sites operate d by the Group near urban centers). For example, exceedances of the applicable limit values observed in the aqueous discharges of the Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s- Elbeuf site has resulted in the initiation of administ rative and other proceedings and will require making investments to correct it. The administrative a nd/or criminal liability of the Group and, where appropriate, the criminal liability of its officers coul d be incurred, and the Group could be required to pay financial penalties or experience the temporary shutdown of a production line or site and, under certain conditions, its closure. Claims for damages to the victims could be made in various jurisdictions as well. The occurrence of one or more such events could have an adverse effect on the business, financial position, reputation, results and outlook of the Group. Even in the absence of any accidents or incidents, it cannot be excluded that (i) remediation work is required and (ii) in the light of legislative or lega l developments or changes in scientific knowledge, a claim against the Group may be sought after the fact by authorities or third parties and/or employees who may have been exposed to chemicals used by the Group. In addition, technical difficulties may arise in the production process or at the product preparation or delivery stage or in the performance of the Group's services as a result of events such as malfunctions of the equipment or manufacturing processes used by th e Group or technical failures. For example, for the production of vitamin B12, which uses biological processes and industrial fermentation techniques, it is important to ensure good control of the process by limiting external contamination. This approach extends to the fermentation and extr action operations of the main API. In 2021, a contamination in the vitamin B12 isolation process significantly slowed down production and resulted in volume losses of approximately 700 kilograms for pharmaceutical vita min B12. Improved cleaning of the vitamin B12 fermentation and extraction systems is underway at th e Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf site. It was also decided to repair and renovate the sewers at the Brindisi s ite in order to improve and secure the collection and treatment of waste and wastewater. Similar difficulties could arise from natural disast ers (such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes). For example, the Group's sites in Brindisi, Italy, and Vertolaye, France, are exposed to earthquake risks, while the site in Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf, located n ear the Seine, is exposed to flooding risks and was temporarily closed in June 2016 due to severe flooding of the Seine. The occurrence of a natural disaster could disrupt the functioning of one of these sites and have a negative impact on the production of certain products important to the Group, such as Ri fampicin, Pristinamycin (Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf, France). The occurrence of such events could also have an imp act on the production of a batch, a series of specific batches or even on production as a whole and result in an increase in production costs due to expenses related to restoration and/or compliance with stan dards, loss of revenue related to disrupted or 25 interrupted production or a deterioration of the re lationship with customers affected by the supply difficulties, which could result in the Group's liability and the obligation to pay compensation to these customers. The Group could be compelled to devot e resources and time to seek out the circumstances that caused such events, which would result in an interruption of produc tion for the products and/or sites affected and the possible loss of other batches or products, which could adversely affect the Group activities. The occurrence of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position, reputation, results and outlook. 3.2.2 Risks related to supply difficulties, raw materi al and energy costs, and relationships with certain suppliers and subcontractors* Supply and raw materials The Group's manufacturing processes depend on the ava ilability of the raw materials used in its business, including synthetic intermediates and solv ents. For the year ende d December 31, 2021, the Group's top ten suppliers of raw mate rials represented 6.4% of its cons olidated revenue and 31% of its raw materials expenditures. Although the Group sources from several third-party s uppliers, some raw materials and supplies come from either a very limited number of suppliers or from single suppliers due to c onsiderations related to the API manufactured, quality, expertise or constraint s resulting from regulatory requirements. This is the case especially with supplies relating to the manuf acture of Sevelamer or Olmesartan, a significant portion of which is provided by a single supplier due to the very high concentration of production in this sector. Furthermore, all of the alkaloids marketed by Francopia, a subsidiary of the Company, as well as the salts derived from vitamin B12, have one or more production steps carried out exclusively at a Sanofi group site. Dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers exposes the Group to changes in supply prices or in the availability, quality or delivery times of the raw material or services in question. In the event that one or more of th ird-party suppliers were unable to supply, within a reasonable timeframe or under satisfactory conditions, certain raw materials or sufficient quantities of certain raw materials or other products or processing services for alkaloids and vitamin B12 salt derivatives, the Group could be forced to search for alternative sources of supply or to stop production of certain products, which could have an adverse effect on the Group's business, financial position and operating results. In addition, increased energy cost s, such as for gas and electricity, or supply difficulties could force some Group suppliers to increase their prices, partic ularly for commodities (such as sugar, natural grain derivatives, acids or nitrogen), solvents and/or organi c intermediates, or to suspend all or part of their activity. Such a situation could have an impact on the Group's ability to source raw materials, particularly those for which there is currently no pr oduction in Europe (such as sodium persulfate). Due to applicable regulatory requirements, the Group may no t be able to find other suppliers with equivalent quality levels within satisfactor y time limits or may be unable to certify other suppliers or may experience an increase in the prices of certain raw materials, which could result in production disruptions and delays or the temporary or pe rmanent inability to deliver products and adversely affect profitability. Moreover, a major supplier of raw materials to th e Group could disrupt its operations due to changing regulatory requirements, import or export restricti ons, natural disasters or international supply chain disruptions caused by pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), geopolitical problems or operational problems or in the event of a failure to meet quality requirements at one of its facilities. If geopolitical tensions and economic sanctions in Easter n Europe, particularly in Ukraine and in Russia, are extended or tightened, difficulties could arise in the supply of raw materials for which alternative sources of supply may not be available in sufficient qua ntities or at affordable prices. See also Section 3.1.1 \" Risks related to the internatio nal nature of the Group activities and to health crises and to geopolitical or macroeconomic instability \" of the Prospectus. 26 For example, Infraserv GmbH & Co. H\u00f6chst KG, which leases the major ity of the Group's buildings to the Group at the H\u00f6chst Industrial Park in Frankfurt am Main, Germa ny, is a major provider of services for the Group, including services re lating to buildings, energy and waste management networks, IT, environmental, logistics and other services. Any lasting interruption in the supply of raw mate rials, services for the processing of certain products and/or adequate materials or any significant increase in the price of such materials or services could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial position and operating income. Energy The Group may directly experience pressures related to the increase in the cost of gas and electricity, which represented \u20ac27.8 million of the Group's supply costs for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with \u20ac29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, energy supply difficulties and/or increases in the cost of energy worl dwide, mainly due to geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, impact the Group's suppliers as described above. The occurrence of one of these events could lead to disruptions in the Group's production or to a temporary or permanent inability to deliver its produc ts within satisfactory time limits and an increase in operational costs and thus a decrease in profitability. Transportation The Group may rely on subcontractors acting on its be half or, in the context of the supply and delivery of its products to its customers, on a large number of transportation companies. For example, products marketed by Francopia, the subsidiary of the Co mpany responsible for the production of alkaloids (including opiates and opioids), are subject to safe transportation constraints. The absence of a carrier capable of, or available for, delivering the Group's pr oducts exposes it to significant delivery delays. It also remains responsible for the services performed by these subcontractors and remains exposed to the risk associated with any improper or late execution or non-performance of the subcontractors' mission. Inventory management The Group may encounter difficulties in its inventory management due, inter alia , to inaccurate projections of demand for products by the Group's cust omers. If the Group fails to anticipate the needs of its customers correctly and therefore to manage the Group's inventory levels, this could lead to a depreciation of the value of certain raw materials and purchased materials that may become obsolete. Any change in inventories, whether upward or downward, affects the Group's cash flows. In addition, the Group uses external suppliers in the United States and Japan to store its products prior to delivery, forcing the Group to put in place appropr iate logistics processes with those suppliers to ensure the secure storage and timely delivery of its products. The failure of these subcontractors could jeopardize the Group's ability to fulfill its commitments , to comply with applicable regulations or to meet the expectations of its customers and could ex pose it to liability, which could adversely affect the Group's reputation, business, results , financial position and outlook. 3.2.3 Risk related to Group investments* In order to maintain the excellence of its manuf acturing facilities and innovation platform, the Group makes significant recurring investments, the amount of which is growing regularly. For example, the total amount of these investments amounted to \u20ac88. 6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to \u20ac88.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These expenditures include maintenance and compliance invest ments to ensure continuous compliance of the Group's production sites with applicable regulatory and environmental standards and performance and growth investments to improve and/or increase its API pr oduction and development capacities. 27 In the future, the Group intends to pursue its inv estment policy while increasing the share of performance and growth investments in the total share of its capital expenditures to implement its strategy and in particular develop its CDMO activities. As a result, over the 2022-2025 period, the Group is planning to invest approximately \u20ac510 million, of which a pproximately \u20ac230 million will be invested at the Group's sites in France (see Section 6.8.3 \" Main future investments \" of the Prospectus). However, the Group may not have sufficient financial and/or hu man resources to make these investments or to implement them on schedule, as these projects are ofte n delivered at the end of the calendar year. For example, the ELLA project concerning the vitami n B12 manufacturing process, which provides for investments of \u20ac22 million, aims to improve yi elds, increase production capacity and reduce production costs. It may not achieve the expected results due to incomplete development of the new process, the Group's inability to scale up the pro cess to an industrial level and/or the Group's inability to construct the production facilities within a satisfactor y time-frame and at a satisfactory cost. The Group could also incur unexpected expenses in connection with its investments, as well as additional delays in commissioning some of its projects, due to an initial incorr ect estimate of the cost or quantity of equipment, an increase in their price, and/or a delay or interruption in the supply chain (see in particular Section 3.2.2 \" Risks related to supply difficulties, raw material and energy costs, and relationships with certain suppliers and subcontractors \" of the Prospectus). Such deviations from initial projections could have a negative impa ct on the expected level of return on investment of the project in question and, consequently, on the Group's business, fi nancial position, operating results and cash flow. In addition, the time required for full operability of new equipment or improvements to existing facilities varies depending on the scale and complexity of the equipment. For example, some of the Group's equipment may be custom-made, a nd the time required for delivery, in stallation and certification by the regulatory authorities and the Group's customers, as well as the preparation and/or updating of regulatory files, can be as long as two or three y ears. In the event that the Group fails to take full advantage of the use of new equipment or the impr ovement of an existing facility, the Group could incur significant fixed costs without generating an increase in its revenue, which could reduce its margins and profitability. Any inability of the Group to implement th e planned investments could also have an impact on the achievement of its strategic objectives. Moreover, if the Group fails to maintain a satisf actory level of competitiveness for its products or services or to generate sufficient demand from its cust omers in relation to the capacity it has developed, the investments made by the Group to improve a nd/or increase its production capacities could prove unnecessary and not generate the expected results. Th e Group may not be able to successfully combine the development of an efficient and economical proces s with its industrializa tion and implementation in the designated facility within a satisfactory time -frame and under satisfactory conditions. As an example, the Group was forced to discontinue project s that had become economi cally unviable, such as the development of a new synthesis route for cortic osteroids in Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf and Vertolaye in late 2017, which led to the recognition of an impairment of \u20ac106 million, and the production of phospholipids in Frankfurt in 2020 due to the im possibility of transposing the process originally developed to an industrial scale, which led to the recognition of an impairme nt of \u20ac9.8 million in the value of the equipment in the Group's balance sheet. In addition, a significant and permanent decline in demand at the Brindisi site in 2021 led the Group to record a \u20ac8.9 million exceptional write-down in the value of certain equipment at the Brindisi site. Changes in regulations or in the classification of some of its products could also force the Group to make investments that were not initially planned. For ex ample, in 2020, the Group had to halt the production of hormones at its Vertolaye site for almost a year in order to improve the containment of these products, due to their classification as HP-APIs (OEB5). Finally, the Group may need additional financial r esources to finance its planned medium- and long- term investments. However, it may not be able to rea lize all or part of its capital expenditures if its cash flows from operations are not sufficient or if it is un able to obtain the necessary funds under its existing loan agreement or secure additional debt. 28 In the event of any of these deve lopments, the Group may be unable to maintain and/or increase its production capacity, which could have a significant ma terial adverse effect on its business, results, financial position and outlook. 3.2.4 Risks related to the demand for the prod ucts and services offered by the Group* During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Gr oup's API Solutions business and CDMO activities represented 75.1% and 24.9%, respectively, of the Gr oup's consolidated revenue compared with 75.8% and 24.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Risks related to the demand for products in the Group's API Solutions business As part of its API Solutions business, the Group occupies a premium position in the API market. The Group's positioning results from the level of service provided to its customers, which depends on regulatory support, the quality of the APIs it mark ets and the reliability of and compliance with the Group's delivery deadlines. This positioning is character ized, in particular, for the Group's customers, by a lower sensitivity to the prices of the Group's products compared to those of most of its competitors. However, the Group may not be able to maintain the le vel of service provided to its customers, especially maintaining its regulatory support, or may experien ce unplanned manufacturing interruptions that could adversely affect its premium positioning, resulting in a decrease in demand for the Group's products or a decrease in prices to enable the Group to continue to sell its products. The COVID-19 pandemic may also change the therap eutic needs of patients, which could result in a decrease in the activity of the Group's customers a nd, consequently, have a negative effect on the demand for the Group's products (see Section 3.1.1 \" Risks related to the international nature of the Group's activities and to health crises and to geopolitical or macroeconomic instability \" of the Prospectus). The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Group's revenue. Risks related to the demand for the products of the Group's CDMO activities Income from the Group's CDMO activities depends in part on the amount of the expenditure by the Group's customers on research and then the developm ent, production and marketing of their finished products, as well as on the income from those activiti es. The investments of Group customers in these areas depend on many factors, such as the amount of requi red investments, the results of clinical trials of those products, competitive intensity or local reim bursement policies in the target therapeutic field. In addition, biotechnology companies, which repr esented about 10.2% of the Group's consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 (excluding Sanofi), finan ce all or part of their research and development expenditure from pr ivate and/or public financing, the amounts, availability and timing of which may vary from year to year, which may lead to delays in making decisions to move from one clinical phase to another or to move on to the marketing of a drug. The level of demand for the APIs manufactured by th e Group also depends on the clinical development and marketing of products by its customers. Products that use APIs manufactured by the Group may not achieve the expected commercial success or obtain expected commercial applications or therapeutic indications for a number of reasons beyond the Group's control. In particular: - the Group's customers may experience a slower ra te of recruitment and enrollment of patients during their clinical trials, particularly for rare diseases, which would result in delays in such trials and, as a result, drug approvals; - products of the Group's customers may fail at any stag e in preclinical or clinical trials (including for reasons related to their therapeutic effec tiveness or the presence of adverse side effects); 29 - the European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\"), the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), or any other health or supervisory aut hority may delay or require additi onal data or the discontinuation of clinical trials conducted by the Group's custom ers or fail to grant them regulatory marketing authorizations required for the marketing of th eir products or discover irregularities during the qualification audit of the manufacturer's fini shed product (prior to obtaining marketing authorization), which could delay the market launch; - the products of the Group's customers may not be as commercially successful as expected, or may be ineffective or less efficient than newl y launched products and/or those of non-customer competitors of the Group, or may cause unforeseen side effects; and - the Group's customers may experience declines in sales volumes in the event of refusal or impossibility, for third-party payers such as government programs or public and private insurance plans and health care networks, to provide coverage and reimbursement at an economically attractive level, or at all. Additionally, the demand for the Group's services in the context of its CDMO activities is dependent on its ability to maintain a high level of compliance with applicable regulati ons and to successfully pass inspections by health regulatory authorities or a udits performed by customers on its production sites. A critical observation by a health regulatory authority and/ or the Group's inability to meet the requirements of one of its customers could result in the loss of one or more existing customers and/or make it difficult for the Group to attract new customers. Finally, the demand for the Group's services depends on the competitiveness of its offers. The Group's ability to offer attractive prices to its customers is due to its reputati on, its levels of development and manufacturing capabilities, the quality of its products and its expertise, as well as the competitiveness of its offers. If any of these factors changes, the Group may not be able to increase or maintain its sales with its customers in the framework of its CDMO activities. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial position, results or outlook. 3.2.5 Risks related to the development, marketing or launch of new products manufactured by the Group on its behalf or on behalf of its customers* As of the date of the Prospectus, the Group market s about 200 APIs and high value-added services to about 530 customers and is preparing to market APIs as part of its CDMO activiti es. As part of its API Solutions business, the Group's future operating in come will depend on its ability to attract new customers for the APIs in its portfolio, improve th e manufacturing processes of APIs and/or successfully identify new APIs that the Group intends to manufactur e to expand its product portfolio. As part of its CDMO activities, this future operating income will de pend on its ability to enter into new contracts for the manufacture of APIs developed by its customers, initiate the development an d/or production of APIs or batches on behalf of existing or new customers, or expand relationships w ith existing customers for new products within a reasonable timeframe. In addition, the API industry is constantly changi ng. The Group cannot guarantee that it will be able to meet changes in the demand for products or service s in a timely manner due to (i) changes in industry standards (including new manufacturing processes and/ or innovative technologies that could render certain Group production technologies obsolete), (ii) ch anges in customer needs, which are increasingly sophisticated and varied, or (iii) the launch by othe r actors of new products or services that are better alternatives than those offered by the Group. Difficulties relating to the development, marketing and launch of new APIs or the expansion of the commercial opportunities of existing APIs manufactured by the Group on its behalf or on behalf of its customers include, in particular: 30 - the development, testing and manufacturing of products in accordance with regulatory and quality standards within a reasonable timeframe; - the obtaining and maintenance of regulator y approvals within a reasonable timeframe; - the availability of raw materials and other ke y elements/components on reasonable commercial terms; - unforeseen costs resulting from new regulatory stan dards such as those related to mutagenic impurities (ICH M7), particularly nitrosamin es, or changes in raw material costs; - delays due to the limited resources of regulatory authorities; - costs imposed by compliance with environmenta l standards, which are higher than those imposed in countries with low production costs; and - the inherent attrition of projects in the clinical development phase. For example, the building at the Vertolaye site de dicated to hormone production was upgraded to comply with standards following the change in the classi fication of hormones as an OEB 5 product, which resulted in a temporary halt in production for the duration of the work in 2020. In the context of its CDMO activities, the Group will have to simultaneously manage a certain number of API manufacturing projects at different clinical stages of development on behalf of its customers in order to take into account the natural attrition of clinical development projects inherent in the pharmaceutical sector. Despite its resources, the Group cannot guarantee that it will be able to develop satisfactory manufacturing processes that meet its cust omers' specifications, or that finished products incorporating the APIs manufactured by the Group will achieve the intended therapeutic results. In addition, a health auth ority's authorization to move a custome r's product into a clinical phase could be blocked due to a failure by the Group prior to pro cess validation, for example, in the event of a breach of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) or the impr oper use of production tools or due to a problem inherent to the robustness of the manufacturing process. In addition, there is a risk of failure by the end customer in the clinical development of the pr oducts. For example, a product developed by a Group customer could be discontinued foll owing clinical phase 1, 2 or 3, which would result in an end to product development and collaboration with the Group. As a result of all these difficulties, the products currently developed by the Group on behalf of its customers may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or may not receive them in a timely manner. Finally, the quality of the Group's products and th e Group's ability to deliver its products within a satisfactory timeframe and their perception by th e market are important elements for the Group's reputation and, consequently, for its business. This is particularly important for the Group's customers located in regulated geographical areas (European Union, United Kingdom, United States and Japan), including the largest pharmaceutical companies and leading biotechnology companies, which accounted for nearly half of the requests for proposals receive d by the Group in the context of its CDMO activities by the end of December 2021, and due to the Grou p's \"premium\" positioning in the market, which is largely based on the regulatory support it offers to its customers and on the qua lity of its products. Any press articles or other negative comments on the pr oducts and services performed by the Group or their quality, whether or not proven, could have a signi ficant negative impact on the Group's reputation, business, financial position, operating income or cash flows. 31 3.2.6 Risks related to the dependence of certain Group sites on the performance of some major products* Certain Group sites generate a significant portion of their sales on the basis of a few major products. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2021, sales of Sevelamer represented about three-fourths of the Group's Haverhill site sales, and sales of Ri fampicin, Spiramycin and Teicoplanine represented about half of the Group's Brindisi site sales. The Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf site produces only vitamin B12 and Pristinamycin. Any event that could affect demand, production and/or marketing of one of these major products, such as serious product liability disputes, production and/or quality problems, supply issues, loss of markets by the Group's customers or the replacement of one of these products by that of a competitor deemed to be more efficient, could have an adverse ef fect on the Group's business (see also Sections 3.1.1 \" Risks related to the international nature of the Group ac tivities and to health crises and to geopolitical or macroeconomic instability \" and 3.2.12 \" Risks related to cost reduction initiatives and changes in reimbursement practices of health administrative authorities \" of the Prospectus). Moreover, due to the specific nature of the manufactur ing of the Group's APIs or applicable regulatory requirements, their production requires the use of speci fic equipment and technologies or, in some cases, dedicated facilities. The Group may experience over capacities in some sites and underutilization of production capacities in others. Howeve r, it may not be able to quickly transfer production between sites using the same technology. For example, the Brindisi site experienced underu tilization problems in the production of anti-infectives during the third quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021, which led to the closure of the site for one month, and the Pristinamycin production site located in Saint-Aubin- l\u00e8s-Elbeuf was temporarily shut down for three months in 2021 due to a decline in sales following the decrease in the prevalence of certa in diseases, mainly due to the h ealth measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic (lock-downs, protective measures, masks). Finally, the Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf site is experien cing recurrent situations of maximum utilization of its vitamin B12 production capacity, which does not allow the Group to fully meet increa sing market demands. As a result, the occurrence of a problem or delay in the production of vitamin B12 could have an unfavorable impact on the operations of the Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf site and on commercial relationships with the Group's customers. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on the business, operating income and financial position of some Gr oup sites and, therefore, on the financial position of the Group. 3.2.7 Risks related to IT systems* The Group relies on its own IT systems to conduct its business, in particular to monitor production, supply, product orders and invoicing, customer communication, personne l management and the provision of information needed by the various operational managers to make decisions. On an exceptional basis, in Germany, the Group relies on a transitional IT system inherited from the Sanofi group and financed by it until the adoption of a new sy stem planned for the fourth quarter of 2022. The Group also entered into a transitional service agreement with Sanofi for the provision of IT services (see Section 3.3.3 \" Risks related to contractual relati ons established with the Sanofi group \" of the Prospectus). Despite a policy aimed at strengthe ning and continuously monitoring th e resilience and security of its IT systems, the Group's inability to control a significan t failure or interruption resulting from an incident (e.g., a power outage or fire), computer virus, cybe rattack or other cause could have an adverse effect on how the Group conducts its business. 32 Healthcare companies are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks whose techniques are constantly changing. If the Group fails to maintain an intern al system for protecting its IT systems against cyberattacks and fails to implement a robust and systematic policy for managing access rights, unauthorized third parties could gain access to sen sitive information about the Group's strategy and activities or certain personal data, which could also ge nerate additional financial costs to strengthen the Group's technology capabilities. In addition, the Group may not train or may inadequately train its employees in cybersecurity. All of these events could have an adverse effect on the business, financial position, reputation, results and outlook of the Group. In addition, the Group outsources certain aspects of its information systems and certain business activities, such as internal audits , shared service centers and tax and statutory compliance of the Company's subsidiaries, in order to optimize the management of its resources and to improve the efficiency and security of its IT in frastructure. It thus relies on the quality of the work and the expertise of its service providers in this field and is theref ore exposed to the risk of a failure on their part. Finally, the Group could suffer significant reputationa l damage if a cyber-attack or other security incident allows unauthorized access to or modification of its information technology data or systems or other external data, or if the services that it provides to its custom ers were interrupted. The Group grants access rights to certain areas of its IT systems to a large number of its employees, as well as to third parties, including external service providers (especia lly IT service providers and consultants). In this context, the Group cannot guarantee, despite the cont rol procedures put in place, that a user cannot access data or features to which it theoretically h as no access, which could lead, for example, to the disclosure of sensitive data or the manipula tion of Group operational or financial data. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial posit ion, reputation, results and outlook of the Group. 3.2.8 Risks related to social dialog Labor disturbances such as strikes, walkouts, advocacy actions or other labor tensions could disrupt the Group's business and have a significant negative imp act on its image and on its business and results. For example: - The Group's sites in Vertolaye, France, experien ced a sustained strike movement in December 2019 at the time of government discussions on pension reform. - The same site experienced work stoppages in July 2021 in the context of the reorganizations surrounding the creation of the Group. - Finally, a part of the production staff at the Gr oup's site in Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf, France, conducted a strike in the third quarter of 2021, demanding the payment of a so-called transfer bonus to all employees of EUROAPI France. This st rike resulted in disruptions in the production of vitamin B12 and had an estimated impact of \u20ac2.8 million on the Group's EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021. As part of the labor process necessary for its creation, in December 2021, the Group conducted negotiations to establish, mainly in France, ins titutions representing employees comprising a Social and Economic Committee ( Comit\u00e9 Social et Economique (CSE)) at its newly created headquarters, followed by a Central CSE. A framework agreement ( accord de m\u00e9thode ) was des Cadres represent over 50% of the employees in Sanofi Chimie). This framework agreem ent provides for the handling, via transition or substitution agreements, of the duration of existing agreements within the Sanofi group that were challenged at the time of the creation of the EUROAPI legal entity by extending that period by three or 33 five years, or even indefinitely. This agreement also provides for the establishment of EUROAPI France representative bodies to conduct the information-cons ultation process within the timeframe of the proposed admission to trading of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. In the future, these negotiations could cause disruption to the Group's business activities. For example, meetings organized by trade union organizations at the Vertolaye site were held on February 7, 2022, in order to share with the employees a progress report on the formation of the Group. A call for a work stoppage was issued on February 10 and was renewed three times a week in order to pressure the Sanofi group to increase its investments in the context of the Company's proposed initial listing. The suspension of the strike was voted on March 10, 2022. In addition, the Group cannot exclude that reorganizati ons related to the creation of the Group or changes related to the strategic development of the Group may affect other sites and cause disruptions in relations with its employees. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on the Group's business, financial position, results and outlook. 3.2.9 Risks related to relations with Group customers other than Sanofi During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Group generated 54.4% of its c onsolidated revenue from customers other than Sanofi and 47.3% of its non-Sa nofi revenue from its ten largest customers. Although the Group generally maintain s long-term business relations w ith its customers (for example, the Group has a business relationship of over 20 years with each of its 20 largest customers in terms of revenue (excluding Sanofi)), it is not able to guarantee that they, along with all other contracts and business relationships, will be eff ectively maintained or renewed at their end. Moreover, the Group cannot guarantee that the conditions for such a re newal will be favorable. In addition, although the Group's ambition is to market to new customers to in crease sales in its API Solutions business, its efforts to mitigate the adverse consequences of loss or reduc tion of revenue through th e gain of new customers could be difficult in the short term, as potential cu stomers generally need time to integrate the Group as a manufacturer (due to regulatory and technical re quirements, among other reasons). Such transitions, which can take several months to several y ears depending on the country, are costly. Moreover, the Group's independence from its main shar eholder is a key factor in the success of the Group's business and technical relationships with other pharmaceutical laboratories. Although the Company intends to implement a governance structure th at it considers adequate, including with respect to the AFEP-MEDEF Code, Sanofi could have a decisi ve influence on the Group's strategic decisions in view of the recent reorganization or Sanofi's we ight in the Group's revenue (see Section 3.3.1 \" Risks related to the influence exerted on the Company's business and strategy by Sanofi, the Company's main shareholder \" of the Prospectus). Finally, some of the Group's business relationships have little or no formalization, especially with regard to purchase orders, which represented approximately 75 % of the restated revenue from the Group's API Solutions business for the year ended December 31, 2021 (excludi ng Sanofi). The Group's customers could also seek to reduce their supply costs and possibly be forced to abandon certain products manufactured by the Group considered unprofitable gi ven increased competition in their own markets. Any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to the Gr oup's customers, the loss of one or more major customers, the Group's potential inability to successfu lly develop relationships with new customers, future price reductions or other contractual benefits granted to Group customers may result in significant fluctuations or declines in reve nue and may have a material negative impact on the Group's business, financial position, operating income and outlook. 34 3.2.10 Risks related to the Company's dependence on its key personnel and qualified employees The Group depends on the expertise of its management team and other key employees. As part of the creation of the Group, the establishment of its orga nizational structure, its governance and its decision- making processes and to help it achieve its stra tegic objectives, the Group relies heavily on the recruitment and retention of certain personnel. For ma nagement positions or in certain sites or regions or specialized activities (such as its commercial activities, its quality and regulatory activities, and its chemical and production activities), the Group faces inte nse competition to recruit and retain qualified persons. Within the Group's CDMO activity, any new investment project also requires experienced and competent employees capable of effectively mana ging the new regulatory requirements and overseeing the manufacturing processes that need to be validated and optimized on behalf of its customers. The Group's experienced and committed staff enable it to implement projects to strengthen its business by developing new technologies (as of December 31, 2021, around 50% of Group employees were dedicated to the development of Group processes, i.e ., 166 people, have a PhD or an engineering degree) and, more generally, adapt to different macroec onomic environments and s upport its financial and non- financial performance. In addition, the Group has in itiated a program to recruit qualified personnel to accelerate the development of its activities in the CDMO area and is considering recruiting more than a hundred employees with PhDs or engineering degr ees, with the aim of increasing the number of employees in its Research and Development (R&D) team to approximately 575 in 2025 (compared to approximately 330 in 2021), includ ing more than 250 employees in th e development teams dedicated to CDMO activities. As of December 31, 2021, Group employees over the age of 55 represented 17.8% of the total number of Group employees, which also requires the organiza tion, over the next few years, of an effective transfer of skills between different generations. In the event of a failure in the policies governing the transfer of skills, accidents or departures for these employees, the Group may not be able to replace such personnel, which would have a ne gative impact on the Group's operati onal performance. Moreover, the departure of such employees to a competitor or the creation by them of actual competition could affect the Group's business. In addition, the Group's business demands the mast ery of very specific skills. For example, the production teams at the peptide and oligonucleotid e factory located at the Frankfurt site have engineering capabilities and rare and valuable skills in chemical synthesis, which give the Group a significant competitive and economic advantage. Th e Group may experience difficulties in recruiting qualified individuals capable of mastering its key skills and/or in passing on these skills to new employees in the event of the loss of key skills following the retirement of certain employees. The Group's ability to recruit qualified persons depends in particular on its ability to reward their performance, give them a share of profits and comp ensate them in an attrac tive way. The applicable executive compensation regulations may restrict the Group's ability to attract, motivate and retain the necessary talent. The inability of th e Group to attract, integrate and/or retain highly qualified personnel, particularly those in key functions, may pose a ch allenge to succession plans, adversely affect the implementation of the Group's strategy and its ability to achieve its objectives and could affect its business and operating income. 3.2.11 Risks related to the Group's acquisition strategy In order to generate additional reve nue growth or diversify its geogra phic footprint or product portfolio, increase its customer base or more quickly develop or acquire new technologies, the Group may consider acquisitions. In this context, the Group may encounter the followi ng difficulties that impact expected synergies and performance: 35 - issues not identified during the due diligence phase could result in significant unanticipated costs, delays or other fi nancial and operational difficu lties as well as unforeseen legal constraints, such as the emergence of higher-than-expected liabilities; - integration of acquired companies or businesses could encounter difficulties; - the departure of key employees of the acquired co mpany, any violations of non-compete clauses binding them to the Group or the emer gence of disputes with key employees; - the technologies acquired could be less effective than estimated, or their industrialization by the Group could be more complex and/or longe r and more expensive than anticipated; - the assumptions made in the business plans of the acquired companies or businesses may prove to be incorrect; and - acquisitions in a new country and/or in a country that is not the Group's home country of origin could involve increased risks. In general, the benefits expected from future acquisitions may not become a reality within the timeframes and at the levels expected, which coul d have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, results and outlook of the Group. 3.2.12 Risks related to cost reduction initiatives and changes in reimbursement practices of health administrative authorities In some of the markets in which the Group's custom ers operate, pharmaceutical products are subject to price controls, with a clear trend toward regular decreases decided by the auth orities, particularly for generic products, related to efforts by government s to limit health care and reimbursement costs. For example, the price of generic drugs is approximately 55% lower than the price of originator drugs in France, Belgium and Austria, while in Germany or the Netherlands, health in surance companies call for tenders directly from generic drug manufacturer s. Generic drug manufacturers accounted for approximately 14.0% of the Group's restated API Solu tions business revenue (excluding Sanofi) for the year ended December 31, 2021, co mpared to approximately 15% for the year ended December 31, 2020. This pressure could result in pressure on the prices of the Group's APIs used to make these drugs or cause the Group's customers to reduce the amount of APIs they buy. Starting with or even prior to the introduction of a generic drug, governments or, in some countries, private health-insurance plans (such as pharmacy benef it managers in the United States, which act as intermediaries between insurance companies, pharmacies and pharmaceuti cal companies to obtain drugs at the best price) can impose a si gnificant, rapid and/or steady decline in the drug's selling price. For example, in China, the authorities have put in place a Volume-Based Procurement (VBP) policy that includes tenders for many molecules, such as the tender launched in 2020 for certain Irbesartan products. The companies with the winning tenders are given a la rge share of the market by offering lower prices. Accordingly, in the event that one of the Group's cust omers is able to win a call for tenders, the increase in sales volumes of the products in question may only pa rtially offset or not offset the effect of the decrease in prices. In the ev ent that a Group customer fails to win a tender or decides not to participate, this could lead to a decrease in demand for the APIs manufactured by the Group that are part of the composition of the drugs in question. This risk could be heightened by changes in the pric ing, reimbursement or cove rage of health products and services decided by some health authorities and pr ivate insurance companies (such as, for example, the drug price reforms being adopted in the United St ates) or in the event of a major economic downturn leading to an increase in he althcare cost reduction initiatives in certain countries. 36 Although the Group has not identified any short-term im pact on its margins due to the generification of a drug using one or more APIs marketed by the Gr oup, the occurrence of thes e events could have a negative impact on the Group's profit margins or have a material negative effect on its business, financial position and its operating income. 3.3 Risks related to the separation of the Group's activities from the rest of the Sanofi group's activities and the Group's structural organization 3.3.1 Risks related to the influence exerted on th e Company's business and strategy by Sanofi, the Company's main shareholder* The Group was created through a reorganization (thr ough the asset contributions and share disposals described in Section 7.1 \" Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus) of part of the Sanofi group's API development, manu facturing, marketing and distribution activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Group generated 45.6% of its c onsolidated revenue from Sanofi. It supplied, in terms of revenue, approxima tely 30% of the APIs purchased by the Sanofi group in the year ended December 31, 2020. The Group's independence from its main shareholde r is a key success factor for its business and technical relationships with other pharmaceutical labor atories. As of the date of the Prospectus, Sanofi Aventis Participations, a company owned 100%, direc tly and indirectly, by Sanofi, holds all of the capital and voting rights of the Company. Following the Distribution in Kind (see Section 22.1 \" Terms and conditions of the Distribution in Kind \") and the Investment (see Section 17.1 \" Shareholders holding more than 5% of the capital on the date of the Prospectus \" of the Prospectus), Sanofi, which plans to continue to hold, through Sanofi Aventis Particip ations, approximately 30% of the Company's capital voting rights, will remain the Company's main shar eholder. Therefore, Sanofi could have a decisive influence on strategic decisions of the Group, in par ticular those requiring shareholder approval (election and dismissal of the members of the Board of Dir ectors, approval of annual financial statements, distribution of dividends, amendment of the articles of association and authorization to conduct capital increases or other issuances of securities, mergers or contributions or a ny other decision requiring approval by the shareholders of the Company). In addition, the revolving credit facility (the \" RCF Loan Agreement \") entered into by the Company on February 22, 2022 (see Section 9.2.2(a) \" RCF Loan Agreement \" of the Prospectus) provides for, inter alia, an event of repayment and/or early cancellation in the event of a change in control of the Company at the request of any lender afte r a conciliation period of at least 60 days. A change of control would occur in the event that (i) Sanofi ceases to hold, directly or indirectly, on a fully diluted basis, at least 15% of the capital and voting rights of the Company and ceases to hold, di rectly or indirectly, the right to appoint or dismiss a member of the Board of Dir ectors of the Company, (ii) any person (other than Sanofi) or group of persons acting in concert (unless Sanofi would hold a majority share in such a group), would acquire more than 50% of the voting rights of the Company or (iii) all or a substantial portion of the Group's assets would be sold to a non-Group member (in one or more transactions). 3.3.2 Risks related to difficulties or delays in im plementing the internal control procedures and appropriate IT systems necessary for the proper functioning of the Group* Following the Prior Reorganization Transactions (see Section 7.1 \" Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus), the Group may experience difficulties in implementing the changes necessary to gain operatio nal autonomy from the Sanofi group (from which it was carved out) or fail to achieve the necessary or ganizational structures and methods for its proper functioning within a reasonable time. To comply with its internal control obligations and those obligations that would apply to it as from the Company's proposed initial listing, the Group has therefore developed additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and pro cedures and hired additiona l accounting and finance 37 staff. Despite these measures, it may not be able to put the necessary reporting structures and internal control procedures in place in a timely manner. The Group could discover weaknesses or areas for improve ment in its internal control and/or internal audit system, which could lead to previously uni dentified difficulties such as difficulty in producing financial statements in a timely manne r or the inability to prevent or detect all errors and/or instances of fraud. The Group could also be investigated and/or incur penalties levied by regulatory authorities in France or abroad. In addition, given its small size compared to the Sa nofi group and the limited experience of its employees with its new scope, some Group employees, initially part of the Sanofi group, may have difficulties adapting to the Group's perimeter, size and/or corp orate culture or adopting the new organizational structures and methods of the Group and/or experi ence difficulties in integrating staff from various business backgrounds. These difficulties could also cause social disruptions (see Section 3.2.8 \" Risks related to social dialog \" of the Prospectus). Any inability by the Group to put in place adequate inte rnal controls in a timely manner and/or maintain appropriate and effective internal control procedures in the light of its new structure could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, re putation, outlook, financ ial position and operating income. In addition, the Group's IT systems may not be immediately mature and fully operational, including with respect to protection against cyber attacks (see Section 3.2.7 \" Risk related to IT systems \" of the Prospectus). The Group, which was created followi ng the Prior Reorganization Transactions conducted between March 2021 and January 2022 , has limited experience as a stand-alone company, which could expose it to difficulties and/or delays in the es tablishment of these structures and procedures, unanticipated additional costs or even previously unidentified difficulties. Delays in the organization of internal control, internal audit and IT systems may also delay the achievement of strategic objectives. 3.3.3 Risks related to contractual relati ons established with the Sanofi group During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Group generated 45.6% of its c onsolidated revenue from Sanofi. The Group currently supplies significant quantities of certain APIs to Sanofi under a manufacturing and supply agreement (the \"Global Ma nufacturing and Supply Agreement\") entered into as part of the completion of the Prior Reorganizati on Transactions, with effect from October 1, 2021, for a period of five years following the loss of control by Sanofi resulting from the Distribution in Kind at the time of the Company's initial listing (the \"L oss of Control\"), which is renewable by mutual consent and was amended on Marc h 1, 2022 (see Section 18.3.1 \" Manufacturing and supply agreements for certain APIs \" of the Prospectus). The Group has also ente red into other commercial agreements with Sanofi in connection with the completion of the Pr ior Reorganization Transactions (see Section 18.3.1 of the Prospectus) such as (i) the Reverse Manuf acturing and Supply Agreements under which Sanofi manufactures several items in the value chain of certa in APIs on behalf of Fran copia and of vitamin B12 salt derivatives on behalf of EUROAPI France, (ii) th e distribution agreement, as amended on February 25, 2022, under which the Group acts as a distributor of some of the APIs manufactured by Sanofi (see Section 18.3.3 \" Distribution Agreements for certain APIs \" of the Prospectus) and (iii) the Master Agreement for Development and GMP Manufacturi ng Services under which Sanofi and the Group both act, as the case may be, as a provider or as a beneficiary of services relating to the development of certain APIs for the CDMO services (see Section 18.3.2 \" Special agreements between the Group and the Sanofi group relating to the development of APIs \" of the Prospectus). The Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement and the distribution agreement contain fixe d price clauses for the duration of the agreement, subject, in the case of the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, to modulation mechanisms for the pricing policy and, in the case of the distribution agreement, to the exclusion of two products. Any one of these agreements may be terminated early, may not be renewed when it expires, or may be renewed on less favorable terms. The supply of APIs to the relevant subsidiaries of Sanofi may also be 38 interrupted, or the Group may not be in a position to win certain tenders launched by Sanofi, or Sanofi may decide to cease the marketing of all or part of some drugs. Likewise, and to a lesser extent, Sanofi may not meet all or some of its obligations under th e distribution agreement to supply APIs intended for distribution by the Group, which could have a ne gative effect on the Group's revenue and level of profitability. The Master Agreement for Development and GMP Manufacturing Services dated October 1, 2021, relating to the development of key molecules fo r the Group's CDMO activities, and the development agreement entered into with Opella Healthcare Group SAS (a subsidiary of the Sanofi group's consumer healthcare business) provide that each current a nd future development/ma nufacturing project for a molecule on behalf of Sanofi or Opella Health care Group SAS under these agreements will be the subject of a specific application contract specifying th e terms of the project. It is specified that Sanofi and Opella Healthcare Group SAS will have the oppor tunity, assessed for each application contract, to terminate any specific application contract for the development/manufacture of a molecule taken in the context of these agreements, in the event of a take over of more than 50% of the Company by a third party company that itself develops or sells a mole cule or a product competing with the molecule developed/manufactured by the Group on behalf of Sanofi or Opella Healthcare Group SAS. The parties may deviate from this principle or specify the c oncept of a competitor, application contract by application contract and molecule by molecule (see Section 18.3.2 \" Special agreements between the Group and the Sanofi group relating to the development of APIs \" of the Prospectus). In addition, Sanofi currently provides IT and ot her services to the Group under a Transitional Service Agreement entered into by and between the Group an d the Sanofi group for a period of three years (see Section 18.3.4 \" Service supply agreements\" of the Prospectus), with the exception of the Frankfurt site, for which the Group relies on a transitional informa tion system inherited from the Sanofi group until the adoption of a new system scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2022. The services provided by the Sanofi group include the maintenance of certain applicati ons and infrastructure support by the partner that provides those services for Sanofi and payment by Sanofi of subscription and license fees. If the transitional service master agreement or any other agr eement with Sanofi were to be terminated or if the provision of those services was interrupted and the Group could not quickly put in place an equivalent alternative to those services, in particular by recr uiting the necessary staff or through agreements with third parties, this could have a material adver se effect on the Group's business, financial position and operating income. The occurrence of any of these events could have a ma terial adverse effect on the level of production of certain key Group products and therefore on its bu siness, financial position, results and outlook. 3.3.4 Risks related to the representative nature of th e consolidated financial statements and other historical financial informati on presented in the Prospectus The consolidated financial statements of the Group contained in Chapter 19 \" Financial information \" of the Prospectus have been extracted from the conso lidated financial statements of the Sanofi group for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as the Sanofi group has not historically prepared financial statements that isolate the business of the Group's scope of consolidation. Although the Group did not own the companies and activities included in its current scope of activity during the periods in question, the consolidated financial statements pres ent, on a consolidated basis, the assets, liabilities, income and expenses directly related to the Group' s business and recognized within the Sanofi group during the periods under consideration. In addition, the Prospectus contains Group perform ance indicators whose publication is not required, or that do not include a definition provided for in IFRS accounting standards, such as revenue broken down by flow, product category and nature of sales, gro ss margin, core EBITDA, EBITDA and the conversion of core EBITDA to free cash flow (Core FCF Conversion) (see Section 8.1.4 \" Main performance indicators \" of the Prospectus). To the extent that the historical organization of the Group's activities diverges from the organizational target and reporting structure decided upon when the Prior 39 Reorganization Transactions were put in place, these performance indicators for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, have been rest ated to enable investors to better understand the Group's new business model effective as of the date of the Prospectus as part of its independence from the Sanofi group (see Section 8.1.4(b) \" Restated performance indicators that take into account the new EUROAPI business model from the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus) and understand the changes in the Group's results as well as the items that may influence its future results. The alternative performance indicators described above , where appropriate on a restated basis, may not be comparable to the indicators named in a simila r manner by other companies. Moreover, even though these indicators are presented to en able investors to better understand the Group's new business model, they are provided for illustrative purposes only and pr epared on the basis of a number of assumptions. They are therefore not necessarily representative of what the Group's financial position and operating income (loss) would have been if it had carried on its business as a separ ate and autonomous entity during the periods presented in the Prospectus and are not indicative of the Gro up's future performance. 3.4 Risks related to the Company's financial position 3.4.1 Exchange rate risks* The Group sells and markets its APIs in over 80 countri es. It is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various exposures to currencies othe r than the euro, which is the Company's functional currency and the reporting currency for the Group's consolidated financial statements. The Group's main exchange rate risk exposure currencies are the US dollar (USD), Hungarian forint (HUF), British pound (GBP) and Japanese yen (JPY). A share of the Group's expenses are denominated in US dollars (USD), while the majority of its sales are denominated in euro (EUR), with the resulting ex change rate risk. For example, disbursement flows in US dollars represented approximately 10% of the Group's total disbursements for the year ended December 31, 2021. The monitoring and evaluation of trends in exchange ra te fluctuations is centralized by the finance team at the Group level. Nevertheless, the Group cannot excl ude that an unfavorable change in the exchange rates of the above currencies may have an advers e effect on its consolidated financial position and results. Dec 31, 2021 Impact on operating income (\u20ac million) Impact on shareholders' equity (\u20ac million) 10% increase 10% decrease 10% increase 10% decrease 0 (0) 5.4 (5.4) HUF 0 0 17.7 (17.7) USD (2) 2 0.6 (0.6) JPY 1 (1) 0.5 (0.5) Total (0) 0 24.2 (24.2) 3.4.2 Interest rate risks The Group's exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates exclusively to the \u20ac451 million RCF Loan Agreement, which bears interest at a EURIBOR-indexed variable rate, plus an applicable margin. In the event that EURIBOR is below zero, this rate will be considered as equal to zero (see Section 9.2.2(a) \"RCF Loan Agreement \" of the Prospectus). As of the date of the Prospectus, the three-month EURIBOR was below zero. If the three-month EURIBOR were to become positive, this could impact the Group's financial expenses. 40 The Group may be required to put in place appropria te hedging products in line with the distribution targets between fixed and variable ra tes. As of the date of the Prospectus, taking into account the policy rates set by central banks and the expectations of rate increases, the Group has not put in place such instruments. 3.4.3 Liquidity risks Liquidity risk is the risk of not having the necess ary funds to meet commitments at maturity. This includes the risk that assets cannot be sold quickly on satisfactory terms in case of need and the risk of anticipated liability or lack of access to credit on satis factory terms. As of Dece mber 31, 2021, the Group is in a positive cash position (restated for IFRS 16) in the amount of \u20ac19.8 million. In a crisis situation, the Group may not be able to obtain the necess ary financing or refinancing to implement its investment plan or obtain such financing or refinancing on acceptable terms. As of December 31, 2021, the Group's financial liabilities included \u20ac189.6 million in accounts payable, \u20ac192.7 million in other current liabilities and \u20ac22.7 million in lease liabilities. The Group is financed under the centralized cash pooling agreement with Sanofi, which centralizes the Group's liquidity under the terms and conditions app licable within the Sanofi Group. The centralized cash pooling agreement with Sanofi will be terminated as of the date of delivery and registration of the EUROAPI shares allocated under the Distribution in Kind, i.e., May 10, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's position with Sanofi under this ag reement is a net asset position of \u20ac10.9 million. On February 22, 2022, the Group entered into a \u20ac451 million RCF Loan Agreement, which may be drawn down as from the admission of the Company's sh ares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris . The RCF Loan Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative undertakings, including: - the commitment to comply with a leverage ratio (representing consolidated net debt divided by consolidated core EBITDA) of less than or equal to 4; - the commitment not to divest, each year, more th an 15% of consolidated assets (or, if this amount is greater, assets in an amount greater than \u20ac200 million); - the commitment not to make large-cap acquisitions funded in whole or in part by the RCF Loan Agreement without the prior approval of the lenders; - the commitment not to create certain security interests (pledges); - the commitment not to enter into any merger, sp in-off or regrouping that would result in the dissolution of the Company; - the commitment by the Company's subsidiaries not to incur debt in an aggregate amount exceeding 20% of the Group's consolidated debt; and - the commitment not to grant loans to third parties or enter into transactions involving derivatives of a speculative nature. Each case is subject to the usual exceptions for this type of financing. 41 3.5 Legal and regulatory risks 3.5.1 Risks related to product liability* The Group, which produces APIs and intermediates in the composition of drugs for human use, could be exposed to risks related to th e incurrence of liability, in particular liability for products that do not comply with regulations. The Group's customers, in their capacity as drug manufacturers, are legally required to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations and sta ndards for the substances th ey use in the manufacture of their products. Consequently, activities related to the manufacture, import, export and marketing of products used in the composition of drugs, in partic ular APIs, are subject to rules and controls by the authorities with the ultimate purpose of ensuring drug quality. Failure by the Group to comply with regulations, standards or contractual commitments w ould expose the Group to liability in civil, criminal or commercial disputes. The process of producing certain APIs is now subj ect to increased monitori ng by health authorities following the detection of mutagenic impurities such as nitrosamines, whose presence was detected in 2018 in a number of APIs and drugs used for the tr eatment of hypertension. Changes in the regulations and standards applicable to the production or quality c ontrol of products to avoid the presence of such impurities could result in constraints for the Group and affect its production capacity. These constraints could also have an adverse effect on the productio n capacities of drug manufacturers and, consequently, on their needs for the APIs manufactured and marketed by the Group that are part of the composition of their products. The Group underwent an analysis of its entire portfolio of APIs, which was carried out by Sanofi and the Group between 2018 and 2021. As of th e date of the Prospectus, this analysis showed no risks for some of the APIs produced by the Group (in particular the absence of Nitrosodimethylamine and Nitrosodiethylamine impurities for sartans such as Irbesartan and Olmesartan Medoxomil) or, for others, allowed the implementation of action plans to remedy the presence of nitrosamines (systematic expert analysis, optimization of processes under de velopment, submission of corresponding regulatory files to the competent authorities), in particular fo r rifampicin and rifapentin, for which the presence of Nitrosomethylcyclopiperazine and Cyclopentylnitrosop iperazine was confirmed. As a result, the Group is developing a plan for the optimization of the ri fampicin and rifapentin pr ocess with the approval of the health authorities (the FDA in the United Stat es and the local health authorities in Italy ( Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco , \"AIFA\") and, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom (\"MHRA\") for rifampicin and the FDA for rifapentin), which aims to limit the presence of nitrosamines below the acceptable daily conten t. The industrial-scale feasibility of optimized manufacturing processes for rifampicin and rifapen tin should be confirmed no later than 2022. More recently, an azide-like mutagenic impurity was de tected in the sartan category. Expert analyses have shown that there is no risk for Olmesartan Me doxomil, but there is a need to optimize the Irbesartan process to ensure batch compliance without having to incorporate systematic reprocessing. In general, the presence of potentially mutagenic impurities re quires the implementation of toxicological and advanced analytical assessments to measure impurities in the trace state and chemical analyses in the event that process optimizations are required to gua rantee that impurities remain at a level below the acceptable daily content. Depending on the therapeutic interest of the API and the available therapeutic alternatives, an event of non-compliance resulting from the presence of mutagenic impurities at a level higher than the acceptable daily content could lead th e authorities to decide to withdraw the marketing authorization for the pharmaceutical products affected a nd thus to the loss of all or part of the revenue from the relevant APIs. In addition, certain products manufactured by the Group are subject to special supervision by the authorities and are subject to even stricter regulations , in particular certain APIs or drugs classified as narcotic or poisonous substances, such as opiates, which represented 5.0% of the Group's restated revenue as of December 31, 2021 (out of a total of 9.1% for alkaloids marketed by the Group, with the remaining 4.1% corresponding to the sale of non-narcotic opioids), due to the serious risk of dependence 42 that may be caused by the excessive or illegal use of such substances. Changes to applicable regulations might create constraints on the production or distribu tion of such products, which could affect the Group's production or sales capabilities (see Section 3.5.4 \" Legal risks related to the operation of activities under exclusive rights \" of the Prospectus). In addition, disputes relating to the marketing and distribution of such products have emerged in some jurisdictions. In the future, such litigation against Group customers could have a negative impact on Group sales volumes and results. Should the Group be unable to resolve an event of non -compliance affecting one of its products or the risking of its liability for its products, its reputation and the marketing of its pr oducts could be heavily and seriously affected, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position, results and, where appropriate, outlook. 3.5.2 Risks related to environmental and safety regulations and environmental liabilities* The Group operates in a restrictive legislative and re gulatory environment with respect to environmental protection, public health and safety. The regulations applicable to the Group's activities w ith regard to environmen tal, public health and safety issues, which may vary by country, includ e pollution prevention; treatment of industrial discharges of any kind (aqueous releases and/or accid ental leaks, air emissions, etc.); the control of industrial sites and their operating c onditions; any restoration of such sites (in particular of the soil); the treatment of waste, noise or visual disturbances; the production, storage, handling, transport and treatment of hazardous waste, dust and fumes; as well as, more generally, public health and food security. The main environmental and other regulatio ns to which the Group is subject are presented in Chapter 10 \" Regulatory environment \" of the Prospectus. The Group must therefore incur significant costs in or der to remain in compliance with the legal and regulatory obligations in force. In the future, it will al so have to continue to incur significant costs (both in capital expenditures and in operating expenses) to continue to comply with its obligations. The Group is therefore anticipating a significant increase in thes e costs in view of increasingly frequent and binding changes in regulations, in particular those related to the protection of the health, public safety and environment. The Group is therefore required to obtain numerous e nvironmental, safety, public health and other types of licenses and authorizations, such as operating pe rmits, waste water discharge permits, water sampling permits or authorizations for the transportation and disposal of hazar dous waste, which are subject to renewal, modification, suspension and possible revocation by administrative and governmental authorities. It operates six industrial sites in Europe , including five sites classified as hazardous by the SEVESO Directive, which include three SEVESO \"Hi gh-Threshold\" facilities in Vertolaye, Frankfurt and SEVESO \"Low-Threshold\" facilities in Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf and Brindisi, due to the risks to human health and/or the environm ent posed by the substances and mixtures used and manufactured at these sites for the purposes of the Group's business. The obtaining, renewal and maintenance of the licenses and authorizations issu ed by the administrative au thorities necessary for the operation of the Group's activities could also be made more difficult and involve significant expenditure due in particular to the growing urbanization of the areas where the Group's activities are located or a tightening of applicable regulations, or as a result of an accident or incident that occurred at one of the Group's industrial sites. For example, following an amendment to Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008, on the classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures (the \"CLP Re gulation\") and in particular the classification applicable to a chemical substance used at the Brindisi site subject to the SEVESO regulation, production volumes were reduced pending the necessary au thorization of that site to allow a change from SEVESO low-threshold to high-threshold. This procedure is ongoing as of the date of the Prospectus. In addition to significant additional cap ital expenditures, these licensing and authorization updating requirements may place the Group under signi ficant operational constraints (reduction of product quantities, discharges, etc.). 43 In the event of non-compliance with environmental regulations or with the requirements imposed by operating licenses and authorizations (aqueous rele ases and/or accidental leaks, emissions, waste treatment), the Group is subject to administrative a nd/or criminal penalties, or even temporary or permanent closure of the sites af fected, which could have a materi al adverse effect on the Group's results, business, reputation, financia l position and outlook. The personal criminal liability of its officers, as individuals, could also be sought in conn ection with these events of non-compliance. In addition, the Group's APIs manufacturing activity is subject to European regulations applicable to chemicals (such as, for example, the European REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals), which came into force in 2007, or the CLP Regulation). These regulations are undergoing significant changes and adopting increasing restrictions and even bans on certain chemicals (substances of very high concer n). Such developments could thus force the Group to invest significantly in order to anticipate and, where appropriate, remedy such restrictions and/or prohibitions (research and development of alternative substances, requests for authorization). Similarly, such restrictions and/or prohibitions could, in the absence of alternatives, lead to the reduction, suspension or cessation of the production of certain pr oducts or the operation of certain production units, without the assurance of compensation for the corresponding losses. Finally, due to their age and/or original location or use (pharmaceutical or other), some of the Group's industrial sites or neighboring sites have histori cal contamination of soil and/or groundwater. In particular, the existence of old quarries filled with waste from past industrial activities (whether or not from Group activities) on sites belonging to the Group or ne ighboring sites, particularly in France (Saint- Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf or Vertolaye), has been noted. Similarly, due to the long history of the Group's activity, discharges may have resulted in historical environmental impacts in soil, surface water or groundwater. Obligations to remedy such contamina tion may be placed on the present or past owners, operators or users of such contaminated sites, without necessarily seeking out fault or non-compliance with the law for the activities that caused such contamination. The Group cannot exclude being charged with such costs in the future in its capacity as an industrial operator responsible for the related environmental liabilities, including potential historical liabilities linked to operational activities. In the context of the Prior Reorganization Transactions, all liabilities related to the pollution or contamination of the environment, the discharge of hazardous s ubstances and/or injuries caused by these substances attached to the EUROAPI scope within the Sanofi group were transferred to EUROAPI, whether the generating event or the circumstances at the origin of these liabilities are known or unknown, prior or subsequent to the effective date of the Prior Reorganization Transacti ons related agreements in each of the concerned jurisdictions. The Group has undertaken to indemnify the Sanofi group if a liability action is brought against Sanofi for these liabilities. The co ntractual undertakings entered into in connection with the Prior Reorganization Transactions are described in Sections 7.1 \" Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" and 18.1 \" Agreements signed by the Sanofi group and the Group for the execution of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus. To that end, provisions were recognized by the Gr oup to cover environmental risks. The amount of provisions for environmental risks as of December 31, 2021 is shown in Note D.10 of the consolidated financial statements in Chapter 19 \" Financial information \" of the Prospectus. At December 31, 2021, a provision of \u20ac47.8 million was reco rded by the Group to address envir onmental risks, and \u20ac29.2 million to address potential restoration costs for leased buildings. The environmental liabilities that may emerge on the Group's sites may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, reputation, results, financial position and outlook. 3.5.3 Risks related to the laws and regulations applicable to the Company's activities* The Group operates in a very restrictive and highly e volving legislative and regulatory environment in terms of safety and good manufacturing practices for h ealth products. Changes to these regulations, their interpretation by the competent courts or authorities, and changes to the applicable good practices create 44 increasing constraints that may require significant in vestments or expose the Group to significant legal risks. The Group could also be subjected to constraints that would slow the development or prohibit the manufacture of some of its products. In particular, requirements for the maintenance or compliance with standards of its equipment and production sites could have a negative impact on development and production activities. The Group and its customers are subject to interna tional, national, state and local regulations and standards that create a complex legal environment applicable at all times in the life of products, production and distribution processes and terms of use. Compliance with these regulations is monitored by international or national authorities, such as the FDA in the United States, the EMA at the European level or the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products ( Agence Nationale de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 du M\u00e9dicament et des produits de sant\u00e9 -\"ANSM\") in France, as well as the ministries responsible for health issues. These authorities have very broad powers of authorization, inspection and sanctioning and may impose financial penalties or tec hnical constraints such as suspensions, product or site operating bans, produc t removals or recalls. In addition, the Group's production sites must be regist ered with local health authorities (in particular the ANSM in France, the Medicines and Healthcar e Products Regulatory Agency (\"MHRA\") in the United Kingdom and the Italian Medicines Agency ( Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco -\"AIFA\") in Italy) and other international health authorities in the co untries in which Group products are marketed, such as the FDA in the United States and the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency (\"PMDA\") in Japan. In addition, all products manufactured at these sites must be manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (\"GMP\") as defined by h ealth authorities and international guidelines such as ICH Q7, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for the Manufacturing of APIs. Compliance with GMP regulations requires the allocation of substantia l resources and significant expenditures. Prior to product authorization, health authorities inspect both production sites and Group procedures to verify compliance with regulatory standards. Periodic inspec tions are also carried out by the Group's health authorities and customers after product authorization. H ealth authorities could also decide to suspend or withdraw product authorizations if regulatory standards were not applied. In the event that the health authorities direct a production site to reduce or cease its activities, or if such a site becomes inoperable, it is necessary to request a new authorization to manufact ure at that site or at another site, which could result in production delays, with a material adver se effect on the Group's competitive position, business, financial position, statement of operations and cash flows. The identification of new issues concerning the safet y or efficacy of certain products and substances, such as the presence of mutagenic impurities, could also lead to changes in the a pplicable regulations or the strengthening of controls and sanctions by the competent authorities. The Group's customers are subject to significant regul atory hazards in the development of new products, which could adversely affect the Group's activities or products. In addition, events of non-compliance that might be detected in Group customers due to non-compliance with applicable regulations or standards or injunctions by the competent author ities could result in consequences for the Group's activities or products, such as inspections, injunctions , product withdrawals or recalls and demands that the Group be held liable by the competent authorities, customers or third parties. In addition, the Group operates in a field that falls wi thin the scope of regulatio ns applicable to foreign investments in France, particularly in the area of pub lic health. As a result, certain foreign investments may be subject to prior authorization by the Minist er of the Economy, who may attach one or more conditions to the authorization of such a transact ion and, in certain cases, refuse to grant such authorization. 45 3.5.4 Legal risks related to the operation of activities under exclusive rights Through its subsidiary Francopia, the Group market s alkaloids, including opiates, for the composition of narcotic products in France, Canada and Japan, but excluding the United States. Francopia is, as of the date of the Prospectus, the only operator in France authorized by the ANSM to market opiates on French territory. The ANSM has also put in place an import quota regime that limits the sale of opiates in France by other companies located outside Fran ce. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Group's sales of opiates in France amounted to \u20ac16.3 million, or 1.8% of its consolidated revenue. However, in countries in which the Group markets opi ates, health authorities such as the ANSM might decide to allow higher import quotas (currently lim ited in France to 10% of the volumes of APIs used by opiate drug producers operating in France), thus forcing the Group's products to face increased competition. Similar quotas exist in other countries, in particular the United States and Spain, which limit the marketing of the Group's opiates. The consequences of such a decision could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, the selling price of the Group's products and, conseque ntly, the Group's financial position, results and outlook. The risk of dependence of the Group on the Sanofi gr oup, which produces all of the alkaloids marketed by Francopia, is describ ed in Section 3.2.2 \" Risks related to supply difficulties, raw material and energy costs, and relationships with certain suppliers and subcontractors \" of the Prospectus. 3.5.5 Risks related to compliance and ethics actions or investigations The Group's activities are subject to various comp liance and business integrity regulations. These regulations could become more numerous and/or bi nding starting with the Company's initial listing. Due to its market and geographical coverage, th e Group is also exposed to risks related to non- compliance with the provis ions of competition law. Despite the Group's efforts, inappropriate or illegal be havior by its employees, officers and/or external third parties acting in the name and on behalf of the Group could occur and could expose the Group and/or its officers to potential prosecu tion and penalties, including fines. Actions or investigations regarding compliance a nd business integrity related, for example, to allegations of corruption, money la undering, misappropriation of propert y, conflicts of interest or non- compliance with procedures, including procurement, in connection with the Company, its employees and suppliers, and in particular with regard to competitive and business practices, the protection of employees, the environment, personal data and other legal matters coul d affect the reputation, business, operating income and financ ial position of the Group. 3.6 Insurance and risk coverage 3.6.1 Insurance policy The Group's insurance policy is coordinated by the Group's financial management with the support of the operational departments. The implementation of insurance policies is based on the determination of the level of coverage necessary to handle the reasonably estimated occurre nce of liability, damage or other risks. This assessment takes into account assessments made by insure rs as risk underwriters. Non-insured risks are those for which there is no offer of coverage on th e insurance market or tho se for which the offer of coverage and/or its cost are not in line with the pot ential interest of the insurance or for which the Group considers that the risk does not require insurance coverage. 46 In particular, the Group has taken out property dama ge/operating loss, civil liability, environmental and cargo policies with internationally renowned and solv ent insurance companies. The Group's policies are supplemented, for risks not covered by them, on a case-by-case basis by policies written locally for a particular subsidiary or site. 3.6.2 Risk coverage policy Objectives Risk control is considered a priority by Group mana gement, which closely links internal controls to internal audits. The Group's risk management and internal control systems are based on the Sanofi group's internal control and risk management practices, which are in turn based on a range of appropriate resources, procedures and actions to ensure that th e necessary measures are taken to enable the Group to: - achieve its objectives, fulfill its missions, and de tect development opportunities in all of its fields of activity while adhering to its va lues and ethics and complying with laws and regulations; and - protect its core assets that are the foundations of its business, identify critical points and potentially risky internal and external events and situations for the smooth operation of its business. Organizational framework The risk management process and internal controls , which allow the Group to identify and prevent the risks that it may face, are overseen by the corporat e affairs and finance departments. The corporate affairs department, which also brings together the Gr oup's expertise in communications, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and public affairs, a nd the finance department contribute to the Group's executive committee. Within each of the Group entities, a person respons ible for risk management designated under the Business Continuity Plans is responsible for identifying in dustrial risks, which is then coordinated at Group level by an Industrial Operations Program Project Manager. In addition, the identification of business risks, strategic projects and health, safety and environmental (HSE) risks is the responsibility of the Sales Operations Department, the Strategy De partment and the Industrial Affairs Department. In addition, risks related to the Company, other globa l support functions and disputes are identified at the Group level by an ESG & Risk Manager within the Co rporate Affairs Department. Risk management is centralized at Group level by the Corporate Affairs Department. Internal control is the responsibility of the operati onal departments of each of the Group's entities, under the control of the financial department, which coordi nates the operation of the whole system. It plays a central role in establishing the procedures applicable at Group level and defining the framework within which subsidiaries exercise their internal control responsibilities. Risk management and internal control system The Group's overall risk management and internal control system is based on several elements, including: - standardized procedures by business line and function; - operational risk control; - the management of the Group's overall risks at different scales (functional departments, subsidiaries); 47 - the mapping of the Group's major risks valid ated by the Group's executive committee in February 2021; - monitoring of the Group's internal control system; - the ethical system and organization comprising the Group's procedures and code of ethics and training courses to be put in place in early 2022; and - the internal audit, which, as an independent assurance function and will be outsourced, assesses the efficiency and functioning of the system as a whole. With regard to internal control and risk manageme nt, as of the date of the Prospectus, the Group chose to work on the basis of the main recommendations proposed by the AMF Terms of Reference and Application Guides, as updated in July 2010, and the recommendations of the report of the audit committee working group, also publis hed in July 2010. The Group also relies on the experience of the Sanofi group in the area of internal control and risk management and has taken inspiration from certain tools used by Sanofi. These tools are being adapted to the Group's business model, geographic footprint and size. Group risk management Group risk management refers to the measures put in place by the Group to identify, analyze and mitigate the risks it is exposed to. The process for developing and reviewing the risk mapping developed by the ESG & Risk Manager, which was implemented in 2020, allows the identification of the main risks to which the Group is exposed and assesses, for each of them, their potential impact as well as the action plan put in place, and in particular the persons r esponsible within the Group for monitoring the remedy plans and associated controls. The Group will set up an operational risk committee, which will be composed of a Chair, a Secretary and representatives of the various functions (strategic , human resources, quality, legal, finance, etc.) and the Group's business divisions, to validate and updat e the risk map based on the updated information that will be communicated to it. The Group risk mana gement system will be regularly reviewed by the operational risk committee, which will report the risks to the Corporate Affairs Department. In addition, the ESG & Risk Manager within the Group's Corporate Affairs Department conducts the specific initiatives su mmarized below. The risk mapping framework will be presented annua lly by the Chairman of the operational risk committee, to the audit committee that will be est ablished within the Board of Directors upon the admission of the Company's shares to trading on the re gulated market of Euronext Paris, and, at its request, to the Board of Directors or to one of its other committees. For example, the internal action and policy plans put in place to manage the risks identified by the Group include: - Risks related to geopolitical and macroeconomic in stability and the international character of the Group's activities. To anticipate the risks related to geopolitical instability and the international character of its activities, the Group relies on the Corporate Affairs Department, and in particular a dedicated network responsible for monitoring developments in each country and in particular in those in which the Group h as production sites. The upstream integration of the Group allowed it to limit the impact of the di fficulties encountered by its Asian suppliers in 2020. - Risks related to competition in the markets in which the Group operates. To limit competitive pressure, the Group relies on several tools, processes and remediation plans: 48 o competitive oversight, by product range and technology, which informs the business strategy of the Group, which integrates it in to its price positioning and the organization of its sales forces and of its offers; o a business risk analysis, which is regularly reviewed to guarantee Group responsiveness and excellence in its support of its customers; o multi-year contracts with customers are encouraged to secure the Group's revenue; o action plans for the optimization of structure costs (see Section 6.4.3 \" Improve operating margin of the Group \" of the Prospectus) and the transformation of the Group, in particular in the context of the developm ent of its CDMO activities (see Section 6.4.2 \"Capitalize on innovation and development to accelerate the reorientation of the portfolio toward the CDMO activities, particul arly in the peptide and oligonucleotide segment \" of the Prospectus) will be deployed in 2022; and o regular investment in the continuous improve ment of processes, in addition to activities for research of new technologies and the de velopment of innovative processes to reduce the production costs and environmental footprint of the Group's production methods and differentiate itself through its technol ogical advances and capacity for innovation. The size and diversity of the Group's portfolio , which consists of approximately 200 APIs registered with regulatory authorities in many countries, offers stability. Its network of industrial sites and production capacities enables it to ensu re the continuity of production operations and monitor projects from the clinical phases to the commercial phases. The Group maintains its reputation as a provider of reliable, high-quality APIs, its regulatory activities and its strong competitive position in the major geographical areas of the global market for APIs and provides its customers with expertise in a wide range of that market to best meet their specific needs. - Risks related to the operation of industrial sites. The Group develops risk reduction plans that incorporate short- and medium-term investme nts as well as organizational or management actions. It also draws on the results of regular re gulatory audits to define scenarios that enable it to assess and anticipate the consequences of diffe rent events and develop human and material recommendations. The Group is also constantly mobilized to develop and operate safe industrial processes, promote a culture of safety and ensure the protection of the health and safety of its employees. The Group is thus implementing Health , Safety and Environment (HSE) procedures that take into account the main problems rela ted to industrial processes and in particular chemical risk management. In particular, with regard to chemical risk management, the Group is putting in place procedures for the safety a nd monitoring of the chemical substances and mixtures that it uses and manufactures at its sites, three of which are rated SEVESO \"high- threshold\" sites in Vertolaye, Frankfurt a nd Ujpest, and two of which are rated as SEVESO \"low-threshold\" sites in Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-El beuf and Brindisi. Facilities operating on the SEVESO sites referred to above are inspected at least twice a year. It ensures technical and regulatory monitoring of the hazardous substances and mixtures used and manufactured. Where appropriate, the Group may be requi red to substitute the use of certain substances at its sites. Employees of the Group that come into contact with chemicals classified as hazardous in the course of their professional activities within the Group shall receive appropriate medical monitoring that takes into account the inherent risks of these substances. - Risks related to supply difficulties, raw material and energy costs and relationships with certain suppliers and subcontractors . The Group conducts regular monitoring of supply difficulties as part of the continuity of the supply progra m implemented by the Sanofi group and adopted by the Group as a result of the Prior Reorganization Transactions. The purpose of the program is to assess risks to the chain (from the supply of ra w materials to the production of the API and 49 the release of the product) and the establishm ent of security plans. The Group has also implemented a program to develop several sour ces of supply for critical raw materials (mono- sourcing exit program) whenever the market pr oposes these potential sources. A continuous and multidisciplinary process of risk analysis of th e raw materials used by the Group and their suppliers is in place to enable the coordination of the qualifications of alternative suppliers or manufacturing sites with a view to reducing m ono-source risks and regional dependence that is critical to ensure continuity of supply. In the current climat e of strong price increases, in particular for raw materials and energy, many of the Group's contracts contain clauses allowing it to pass on part of the increases in these costs to its customers. The Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, as amended, includes (i) a compensation mechanism for the Group in the event of a significant increase in the price of certa in key raw materials and solvents, subject to the compliance with certain thresholds and time lim its, and (ii) a clause providing for reciprocal sharing of a portion of the increase in energy costs related to Sanofi's purchases, in relation to a reference base determined by the parties, wh ich is applicable from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2026. The Group also intends to further formalize the relationship with its suppliers through contracts rather than purchase or ders in order to better control the volatility aspects for all raw materials used by the Group. To handle the difficulties of energy supply and the increase in its cost, the Group sources directly from the gas and electricity markets and uses hedging instruments (futures contracts), to make pr ices more even over time. These instruments cover almost all of the Group's energy purchases in 2021 and 2022 (except spot purchases) and, as of the date of the Prospectus, approximately 20% of its energy purchases for 2023. The Group's coverage strategy is to hedge over an an ticipated period of three years and to have a minimum of 90% of prices fixed before the end of year N-1 for year N. In addition, the manufacturing of alkaloids marketed by Francopi a is subcontracted to a Sanofi group site under a Reverse Manufacturing and Supply Agreement in effect for a period of five years from the date of the Loss of Control by Sanofi. Francopia also uses several specialized secure transport providers, which have been audited by the Sanof i group. In addition, the import quota regime introduced by the ANSM to limit the sale of opiat es in France by other comp anies located abroad was supplemented in 2018 by a secure inventory po licy adapted to the needs of operators, which helps to secure supplies. Finally, the raw mate rials necessary for the manufacture of the APIs of Francopia and the finished products are stor ed separately to reduce th e risk of breakage in the event of an incident. - Risks related to Group investments . The Group relies on the investments made by the Sanofi group on the transferred sites over the past fe w years, which mainly include maintenance and compliance investments. In the fu ture, it intends to continue this invest ment policy by increasing the proportion of performance and growth investme nts in the total share of its investments. These projects (duration, amounts) are monitored by dedicated teams at the local level and/or globally for strategic projects. Moreover, some of the Group's growth investments made as part of its CDMO activities have been co-financed by its customers, in addition to the amounts invested by the Group, in the form of payments prior to investments made or of increased payments on the price of the products during the commercial relationship. - Risks related to the demand for the produc ts and services offered by the Group. The Group relies on an annual business risk analysis to develop the business strategy for its highly diverse portfolio of approximately 200 AP Is spread across several therap eutic areas. To be constantly in line with the needs of the market, a t eam of business analysts monitors the Group's competitors and market trends. The Group has also put in place a pro active strategy for the development of its portfolio and the extension of the range of its APIs, which is driven by a team of product portfolio managers to adapt to changing market needs. - Risks related to the development, marketing or l aunch of new products manufactured by the Group on its behalf or on behalf of its customers . The Group has established a business development plan, equipment investment plan and skills recruitment plan to expand its product portfolio with new products and its CDMO activitie s, which is one of the pillars of the Group's 50 organic growth. The Group's objective is to increase the number of employees in its R&D team to approximately 575 in 2025 (from about 330 in 2021), including a number of employees in the development teams dedicated to the CDMO activities exceeding 250 by 2025. To ensure operational agility, a system for managing the pr iorities of research and development (R&D) projects and commercial projects based on the possi bilities of the sites is being put in place to respond as quickly as possible to the requests of customers in relation to the Group's strategic plan, while offering them the necessary guarantees of feasibility, quality and confidentiality for that activity. - Risks related to the dependence of certain Gr oup sites on the performance of some major products. The growth of CDMO activities, including the development of the formulation and production of new APIs, will help to diversify the activities of the Group's production sites and reduce their dependence on the performance of a few products. The Group has also set up training to strengthen the mobility of certain team s, which will be able to move from one Group site to another according to the needs of the customers for the Group's APIs. In addition, the Group's premium positioning, both in the context of its API Solutions business and as a CDMO, is characterized in particular by a price sensitiv ity that is lower for the Group's products than the products of most of its competitors. - Risks related to IT systems. In order to protect the Group's IT systems and mitigate the increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that targ et healthcare-related co mpanies, a reference framework has been put in place with the s upport of the Sanofi group. The Group has also defined a program for the governance and monitori ng of the security of its IT systems that includes crisis management and business continu ity plans and initiated the recruitment of a Chief Information Officer. The Group's cybersecur ity strategy is comprised of five pillars: o the protection of the Group's IT systems, which is based in particular on continuous Internet protection; o monitoring, through the use of daily performance indicators for Group terminals; o responding to threats, including through a highly automated cybersecurity operations center, which is based on the various tools deployed on the Group's platforms to detect and classify security-related events for the Group's IT services and intervene to stop or reduce such events; o accountability, which is based on several services available to end users and companies; and o data recovery, including regular crisis traini ng and testing of data backups for critical functions. The deployment of security applications that pr event, detect and respond to cyberattacks is underway to be operationa l by March 31, 2022. In the context of the Prior Reorganization Tr ansactions, the Group relied on the principles for cyber security and the technical solutions adopted by the Sanofi group. It is also establishing its IT security department in close collaboration with Sanofi and recruited a director of IT security. The Group will benefit from Sanofi's support until th is department is fully operational. The personal data protection policy inhe rited from the Sanofi group is currently being adapted to the Group's business model and will be implemente d before the Company's initial listing. In addition, the Group will subcontract a portion of the services to benefit from the latest technological advances useful for its protection and will receive the support of the Sanofi group under a transitional service agreement (see Section 18.3.4 \" Service supply agreements \" of the Prospectus) until the implementation of those services. 51 - Risks related to social dialog . As part of the labor process necessary for its creation, in December 2021, the Group conducte d negotiations to establish, mainly in France, institutions representing employees comprising a Social a nd Economic Committee (Comit\u00e9 Social et Economique (CSE)) at the headquarters level, followed by a Central Social and Economic Committee. In addition, an equity-interest agreem ent and an incentive agreement will be put in place by the Group in France, in order to collec tively guarantee eligible employees the right to participate in the results of their company and to collectively associate eligible employees with these results. In order to guarantee the quality of the social dialog, several studies and surveys were also conducted on the basis of interviews and feedback. The items collected in these studies and surveys are used to develop acti on plans to prevent labor tensions. - Risks related to relations with Group customers other than Sanofi. The Group conducted a customer satisfaction survey in 2021 to anticipat e possible risks related to the relationship with its customers. The market for APIs is characterized by (i) a significant captive market of pharmaceutical companies, in which developmen t and production are oriented toward their internal use, (ii) a long time-to-value for a cha nge of supplier and (iii) a limited share of the cost of the API in the final cost of the finished product. In addition, manufacturing processes and supply chain characteristics must be agreed upon, approved and established prior to the start of commercial manufacturing, taking into account th e regulatory framework. In addition, certain contracts entered into by the Group, both in the context of its API Solutions business and CDMO activities, include guaranteed minimum purchase volumes. The Group also enjoys a commercial structure focused on its customers that is pr esent on all continents (see Section 6.5.3(d) \"Marketing \" of the Prospectus). In order to maintain the quality and reliability of the supply of its products and the excellence of its technol ogy platform, the Group also makes significant recurrent investments. - Risks related to the Company's dependen ce on its key elements and qualified personnel . The Group initiated the implementation of a succession plan for persons in senior management functions, including programs for training and transmission of operational capabilities within the Group. As part of the implementation of its target organizational structure, the Group carried out an analysis to identify possible skills gaps. An active recruitment syst em has also been put in place. The system consists of various ph ases: planning and approval, candidate searches, profile reviews, interviews, selections and offers and post-recruitment. In addition, a training plan has been developed to address the deficit of certain skills and anticipate skill management needs. - Risks related to acquisition strategy. The Group's acquisition strategy is based on the complementary nature of the technologies, mark ets and portfolios of an acquired company and of the Group in order to facilitate the integra tion of the acquired company. A team of two strategy leaders runs a working group in which various company departments (CDMO, Sales, Marketing, R&D, Industrial and Scientific Operations) particip ate to monitor a pipeline of complementary targets. - Risks related to cost reduction initiatives and changes in reimbursement practices of health administrative authorities. The pressure on prices due to the control exercised by health authorities and insurance on the cost of health care expenses is a constant in the pharmaceutical market. This phenomenon is offset by the aging of the population, the increase in life expectancy and demographic growth, which support the dema nd for drugs and thus the production volumes of drugs and, consequently, the APIs that are part of the composition of those drugs. In order to prevent the erosion of its margins, the Group i nvests in technical innovation to reduce prices and in the distinctiveness of its APIs. The Gr oup's offer through its CDMO activities is also directed toward innovative compounds developed by pharmaceutical laboratories . - Risks related to the influence exerted on the Co mpany's business and strategy by Sanofi, the Company's main shareholder . The Company intends to establish a governance structure that it 52 considers to be in compliance with th e AFEP-MEDEF Code (see Section 15.4 \" Declaration of compliance with the corpor ate governance system in force \" of the Prospectus). In this regard, it should be noted that Sanofi, through its subsidia ry Sanofi Aventis Participations, will have only one representative out of a total of ten members of the Board of Directors of the Company as of the admission of the Company's shares to tradi ng on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, that the Company intends to appoint at least si x directors who are independent according to the criteria defined in the AFEP-MEDEF Code as of the admission of the Company's shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris and that both companies (Sanofi and EUROAPI) do not have any executive corporate o fficers in common (Chief Executive Officer and/or Deputy Chief Executive Officer). - Risks related to difficulties or delays in the implementation of internal control and other structures and appropriate IT systems necessary for the proper functioning of the Group. The Group relies on the experience of the Sanofi group in internal control, internal audit and risk management, and in 2020, it engaged an external service provider to carry out a review of its risk management, internal control and internal audit functions, which resulted in action plans that are currently being implemented. In partic ular, internal auditing will be outsourced to a recognized service provider in order to ensure the professionalization of these tasks and adequate resources adapted to the Group's size. A regular communications and change management program for Group employees and mana gers was established prior to the review of the social agreements initiated at the beginnin g of the second quarter of 2021 as part of the Prior Reorganization Transactions. In addition, th e Group has initiated a cultural transformation program based on its values and expected be haviors (agility, customer orientation, entrepreneurial spirit) and has established indicators that w ill enable its employees to assess their performance under the new scope and that will be used for the variable remuneration that may be awarded to them. The information tec hnology systems and procedures specific to the Company with regard to internal control and inte rnal audit are also bei ng adapted to the specific characteristics of EUROAPI and are currently being improved. - Risks related to contractual relations established with the Sanofi group. In accordance with the terms of the Master Carve-Out Agreement en tered into by and be tween the Company and Sanofi, which lays down the general principles and organizes the terms and conditions for the completion of the Prior Reorganization Transac tions, the Company and Sanofi have appointed a committee to monitor the Prior Reorganizati on Transactions and a committee to monitor the commercial relationships between the parties. Both committees will continue to meet for a period of three years, and five years from the Loss of Control by Sanofi, respectively. In addition, the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agr eement entered into by the Group with effect from October 1, 2021, has a term of five years following the Loss of Control by Sanofi. Finally, for several products, the Group acts as the sole s ource of supply listed in the Sanofi group's regulatory file for a specific drug. The Group's sales for these products amounted to approximately 30% of the Group's restated reve nue for the year ended December 31, 2021. - Exchange rate risks. The overall management of exchange rate risk for the Group as a whole is overseen by the Group's financial department. The only authorized instruments will be spot and forward purchases/sales as well as vanilla exchange options (call/put). The Group does not use financial instruments on a speculative basis. Balan ce sheet exchange rate risk will not be hedged . - Interest rate risks. Given the centralization of financing, in terest rate risk is localized at the Group level. The only instruments allowed are swap s and so-called vanilla (cap/floor) exchange options. The Group does not use financia l instruments on a speculative basis. - Liquidity risks. The Group has set up a centralized cash flow driven by the Company for all of its subsidiaries (cash pivot and centralized ma nagement of financing) . Monitoring will be provided by a company computer tool that will ma ke it possible to retrieve the bank statements of all Group subsidiaries and the issuance of almost all payments. Electronic payments not 53 managed by the said IT tool will be administered by the Group through the online banking services of its banking partners (m ainly in Japan and China). In a ddition, on Febr uary 22, 2022, the Group entered into the \u20ac451 million RCF Loan Agreement, effective as of the admission of the Company's shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. - Risks related to product liability. Between 2018 and 2021, Sanofi and the Group conducted a risk analysis of the entire portfolio of APIs tr ansferred to the Group related to the presence of mutagenic impurities in the nitrosamines family. Th is analysis showed that there is no risk of nitrosamines for some of the APIs produced by the Group (in particular the absence of nitrosodimethylamine and nitrosodiethylamine impurities for sartans such as Irbesartan and Olmesartan Medoxomil) or, for others, to implemen t nitrosamine remediation plans and develop a methodology to proactively assess and mitigate th e risks associated with nitrosamines. The Group will also continue to proactively assess the risk of mutagenic impurities in its key APIs over the next five years in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guideline M7(R1) on assessment and control of DNA reactive (mutag enic) impurities in pharmaceuticals to limit potential carcinogenic risks. This expertise will en able the Group to ensure risk control and develop a competitive advantage over its compe titors by offering its pharmaceutical customers regulatory files that comply w ith the current requirements of the authorities. Depending on the chemical process applied by the Group, the iden tification of a mutagenic impurity may be a competitive opportunity factor in the event of compliance with the applicable regulations. Moreover, as of October 1, 2021, Sanofi has ag reed to compensate the Company for the costs related to the regulatory review of a list of APIs included in the scope of the Transferred Activity, up to a maximum amount of \u20ac15.0 million (see Section 18.1 \" Agreements signed by the Sanofi group and the Group for the executi on of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus). - Risks related to environmental and safety regulations and environmental liabilities . The Group devotes a significant share of its investments to th e maintenance of its industrial equipment, the compliance and safety of production equipmen t and facilities and the improvement of productivity. Actions to remedy the historical impacts arising from the activities conducted on the Vertolaye and Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf sites are being carried out under the supervision of the competent administrative authorities. Th e Group's sites are implementing regulatory oversight and employing local third-party co mpanies to implement advanced regulatory oversight to comply with the latest regulator y developments and anticipate potential regulatory developments by identifying weak signals and regulatory trends. Furthermore, the Group aims to have all its sites achieve ISO 14001 (best environmental practices) and ISO 50001 (best energy practices) certification by 2023 at the la test. In order to mitigate risks related to environmental liabilities, on December 31, 2021, the Group recorded \"provisions for environmental risks\" for a total amount of \u20ac47.8 millio n to cover, in particular, risks related to the current on-site hydraulic containment of po lluted groundwater and the corresponding control measures in such locations as Frankfurt, Brindisi, Ujpest and Vertolaye. However, no assurance can be given that these provisions are sufficient to cover the actual costs incurred in relation to the identified contamination. The Group also has insurance covering environmental liabilities prior to the date of the transfers for a period of ten years from October 1, 2021, and for a maximum amount of \u20ac50 million (subject to the usua l exclusions for this type of insurance) and a commitment by Sanofi to assume the remediati on costs identified at certain non-operational Group sites located in France limited to \u20ac16.7 million (see Section 18.1 \" Agreements signed by the Sanofi group and the Group for the executi on of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus). - Risks related to the laws and regulations applicable to the Company's activities. The Group's quality department monitors applicable regul ations and ensures that harmonized quality standards are applied throughout the world in orde r to comply with regulatory requirements. In addition, as of October 1, 2021, Sanofi has agr eed to compensate the Company for the costs 54 related to the regulatory review of a list of APIs included in the scope of the Transferred Activity (as defined in Section 7.1 \" Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \"), up to a maximum amount of \u20ac15.0 million (see Section 18.1 \"Agreements signed by the Sanofi group and the Group for the execution of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus). - Legal risks related to the operation of activities under exclusive rights. Francopia's business in France is under the control of the Internationa l Narcotics Control Board (INCB) in accordance with the principle of \"one country, one producer\" that arose from the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. In this context, the ANSM has introduced an import quota scheme to define the scope of Francopi a's exclusivity for French pharmaceutical operators. - Risks related to compliance and ethics actions or investigations. As part of its creation and implementation of its organization and governan ce, the Group has adopted a set of policies designed for all its employees to ensure the integrity of the Group's business practices, the management of its information and the protec tion of its employees. These policies include an anti-corruption policy, a conflict of inter est policy, a policy on donations and other contributions, a whistleblowing policy and a disciplinary policy. Ethical measures and organization Ethics and anti-corruption rules are key values and a major concern of the Group. The Group now has a compliance, ethics and personal data manager and has put in place pro cedures and a code of ethics. It also expects its partners, mainly its suppliers and cu stomers, to comply with its ethics and anti-corruption policy. In addition, the prohibition on engagi ng in fraudulent practices is the subject of dedicated training and extensive communication within the Group to ra ise awareness among employees and limit the risks related to corruption and ethics. 55 4.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 6.1 Overview The Group develops, manufactures, markets and di stributes active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and intermediates used in the formulation of me dicines for human and veterinary use, both from originators and generics, including all types of molecu les in the API market: small molecules (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemist ry molecules derived from fermentation and highly potent molecules (\"HP-APIs\")) and large molecules (such as peptides and oligonucleotides). As of December 31, 2021, the Group markets its APIs to approximately 530 customers in more than 80 countries. Its customer base includes the majority of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies (including Sanofi, Boehringer Ingelheim and Al fasigma), generic drug manufacturers (Teva), and animal health products manufacturers (MSD Animal Health, Ceva), consumer health and nutrition products companies (DSM), biotech companies (Mithra, SQY Therap eutics, Rancho Santa Fe and NH Theraguix), CDMOs (Catalent) and distribution co mpanies. The Group, which generated \u20ac902.2 million in restated revenue and \u20ac892.8 millio n in consolidated revenue for th e year ended December 31, 2021, estimates that, in terms of revenue, it is the world' s leading manufacturer of small molecules and the world's second-largest manufacturer of APIs (includi ng small molecules and large molecules), as well as the seventh-largest manufacturer in the globa l CDMO (Contract Development & Manufacturing Organization) market in 2020.6 The Group is the result of a reorganization of pa rt of the Sanofi group's activities (see Section 7.1 \"Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus) in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of APIs. Wi th more than 150 years of experience in the API market, the Group is composed of six manufacturing sites and development centers equipped with state- of-the-art technology, all located in Europe (Vertola ye and Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf in France, Frankfurt in Germany, Ujpest in Hungary, Brindisi in Ital y and Haverhill in the United Kingdom), and a customer- oriented organization responsible for the commerci alization and marketing of its products, with a worldwide reach. The Frankfurt site is the largest production site for APIs in Europe.7 As of December 31, 2021, the Group employs around 3,350 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). APIs enable the pharmacological activity of a drug and, together with excipients, are one of the two key components of a drug. The Group is engaged in the merchant market for APIs, corresponding to the development and production of APIs intended for sale to third parties. The Group offers its customers (i) a diversified portfo lio of APIs from its third-party sales business, for which the intellectual property is owned by the Group or licensed by the Group and/or is subject to a distribution agreement (the \"API Solutions\" busin ess), and (ii) development and/or manufacturing services for APIs, as a CDMO, for which the intellect ual property is owned by the Group's customers (the \"CDMO\" (Contract Development & Manufacturi ng Organization) business). In addition to the sale and development of APIs, the Group also offers a ra nge of high value-added services allowing to meet customers' business needs and to support them in th eir regulatory filings. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the API Solutions business and CDMO ac tivities respectively accounted for 75.1% and 24.9% of the Group's consolidated revenue. The Company's strategy is focused on reinforcing its status as a key player in the small molecules market, both by accelerating the growth of the revenue of its existing portfolio of APIs in its API Solutions business, and by encouraging the growing exposure of its portfolio to its CDMO activities, especially by continuing to invest in technology an d innovation, as well as the development of its 6 Source : Company's estimate based on third-party market research conducted using the annual reports published by the main industrial players in the APIs sect or, public databases (including Capital IQ and Orbis) as well as interviews with market experts. 7 Source : Company's estimate based on the market research conducted by third parties and interviews with market experts. 59 production capacities and it aims to improve the Grou p's operating margin, continue efforts to improve cash position and pursue a strong environmental and so cietal commitment by capitalizing mainly on the strong legacy of Sanofi. 6.2 Description of markets and competitive position 6.2.1 Presentation of the API market8 Medicines are generally composed of two key elemen ts: the APIs or \"drug substances\", which enable the pharmacological activity, and the excipients, whic h are necessary for enhanced stability and better absorption of the API within the drug. The value chain of the pharmaceutical industry includ es the discovery and development of the medicine (including the API), the development of the manuf acturing processes to produce the API and the drug product, production (API and medici nes), packaging (primary and sec ondary) and logistics operations, as well as the marketing of the medicine (exclusively, during the term of the patents, then in generic form thereafter). The market for the manufacturing process development and production of APIs breaks down into two sub-markets: the captive market: the development and productio n of the API are carried out by the company that markets the finished drug product; and the merchant market: the development and/or th e production of the APIs is outsourced by the company that markets the finish ed product to third parties. Due to the criticality of APIs in the value chain of the drug, production is heavily regulated by the health authorities, from quality and patient safety to h ealth aspects in the workplace and the environment. Certifications (regulatory files) are necessary to sell them. Regular inspections by health authorities are conducted at the sites. In addition, the industry is characterized by de velopment and manufacturing processes with long and complex cycles that require significant financial inv estments, a high level of expertise and control of different production technologies, as well as solid e xperience in managing the value chain (including supply, complex analytical validation methods a nd the elimination of manufacturing waste) which generate major investments, technol ogical and logistics constraints. 6.2.2 Market dynamics9 Market size and segmentation of the API Within a pharmaceutical market of around \u20ac1,130 bil lion in 2019, EUROAPI targets the merchant part in process development and the API manufacturing ma rket, resulting in an ad dressable market valued 8 Sources: Technavio - Global Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Market, 2017-2021; BCC - Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Global Markets, January 2021 ; Interviews with experts on the API market conducted early in 2021 , World Health Organization (WHO), Company's estimates on the basi s of market studies conducted by third parties. 9 Sources: IQVIA Institute for Human data Science - Global Use of Medicine in 2019 and Outlook to 2023, January 2019; Technavio - Global Activ e Pharmaceutical Ingredients Market , 2017-2021; ResultsHealthCare - CRO Sector - M&A Drivers and Market Trends, Ma rch 2019, BCC - Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Global Markets, January 2021; Mordor Intelligence - Global Ac tive Pharmaceutical Ingredie nts (API) market (2019 - 2024), 2018; William Blair, Catalent, Inc.

The merchant market of process development and th e manufacture of APIs can be further segmented by molecule type between the small molecules market (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation a nd HP-APIs) with a value of \u20ac59 billion in 2019 (versus \u20ac48 billion in 2016), representing around 80% of the total merchant market, and the large molecules market (such as peptides and oligonucle otides), valued at \u20ac13 billion in 2019 (versus \u20ac10 billion in 2016) or around 20% of the total merc hant market. During the 2010-2020 period, small molecules represented more than 65% of all mo lecules approved by the United States FDA (Food and Drug Administration).10 By the end of 2025, around half of the molecules approved by the FDA should be small molecules. The merchant market of small molecules can be seg mented into three sub-fa milies: complex chemical synthesis molecules (a market valued at \u20ac25 b illion in 2019), biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation (with a market value of \u20ac25 billion in 2019) and HP-APIs (with a market value of \u20ac9 billion in 2019). The distribution of the new molecules approved by the FDA since 2016 is presented below:11 1 Small interfering RNA 2 Antibody-drug conjugates 3 Includes antibodies and equivalents 4 Including lipids, radioconjugates, polymers and neurotoxins The Group, which has the capacity to produce more than 80% of the new molecules approved by the FDA since 2016, has a strong presence in the complex chemical synthesis molecules and biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation sub-families, with an emerging presence in the HP-APIs and in large molecules (peptides a nd oligonucleotides in particular), which are key components in the Group's strategy for future growth. Market growth12 The merchant market of process development and manufact ure of APIs is expected to grow in line with historical growth (around 7% per year over the period from 2015 to 2019), from 6% to 7% per year from 10 Sources : FDA database; BioPharma Trend - Will Biologics Surpass Small Molecules In The Pharma Race? - July 2018. 11 Sources: FDA extraction; C&En - The Years in New Drugs 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020. 12 Sources : BCC - Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Global Markets, January 2021; Technavio - Global Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Ma rket, 2017-2021; Mo rdor Intelligence - Glob al Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) market (2019 - 2024), 2018. 61 2019 to 2024, despite an annual growth rate that fell to 2% between 2019 and 2021 due to the COVID- 19 pandemic.13 In 2024, the size of the merchant market for pr ocess development and the manufacture of APIs is expected to reach \u20ac99 billion, amounting to \u20ac79 bi llion for the small molecules market (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemi stry molecules derived from fermentation and HP- APIs), i.e., around 80% of the total merchant market , with an average annual growth rate of 6%, and \u20ac20 billion for the large molecules market, (suc h as peptides and oligonucleotides), representing approximately 20% of the total merchant market , with an average annual growth rate of 8%. Growth in the coming years should be primarily carri ed by the growth in volumes in the pharmaceutical market, the favorable product mix effect with a pr ogressive shift to more complex and more expensive APIs, the trend toward increased outsourcing by the ph armaceutical companies of a portion of the value chain of the drug, and a limited increase in prices at constant scope, as follows: pharmaceutical market volume: set to grow at 2% to 3% per year going forward, driven by an aging population, increased access to health care in the emerging markets, patents cliffs, increasing generics penetration, an increase in the incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases and innovation in the development of new drugs and application forms (in immuno-oncology in particular, in rare diseases and gene and cell therapies); product mix effect : a positive mix effect contributing around 3% to the annual growth, carried by a growing portion of high value medicines (p articularly the large molecules and the HP- APIs) with a growing demand for targeted therapies; outsourcing trend: further outsourcing is expected to contribute 0.5% to 1% per year going forward as pharmaceutical companies take advant age of development and production capacities, shorter delays in the market launch of new th erapies as well as the scale of the CDMOs; and like-for-like prices: price evolution is expected to rema in fairly stable (contributing from 0% to 1% per year). Price changes are higher in certain sub-families of APIs. 13 Source: Company's estimates based on market research conducted by third parties using the IQVIA database. 62 During the 2019-2024 period, the merchant market for process development and manufacturing of APIs is expected to grow at an average rate of 6% to 7% per year despite the fall in the annual growth rate to 2% between 2019 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The API Solutions market is expected to grow at an average rate of 5% to 6% per year and the CDMO market is expected to grow at an average rate of 7% to 8% per year over the same period.14 The strongest growth by family of APIs is expect ed in the peptides and oligonucleotides market (the family of large molecules) with respective average annual growth of 8% to 10% and 12% to 14% until 2025. An average growth of about 8% per year is expected until 2025 in the market for biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation (including growth of 4% to 8% per year for anti-infectives and 6% to 7% per year for vitamin B12 and its derivatives) and HP-APIs (including gr owth of 4% to 6% per year for prostaglandins). Complex chemical synthesi s molecules are expected to grow by 3% per year over the same period (including growth of 2% to 4% for steroids, 5% to 10% for alkaloids and 5% to 7% per year for sartans). In therapeutic areas, oncology, cardiovascular disea ses and pneumology are expected to record the highest growth rates (7% per year from 2019 to 2025) given the growing prevalence of the underlying diseases. 14 Sources : BCC - Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Global Markets, January 2021; Technavio - Global Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Ma rket, 2017-2021; Mo rdor Intelligence - Glob al Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) market (2019 - 2024), 2018. 63 6.2.3 Competitive landscape15 Overview The world merchant market of APIs is very fra gmented with over 1,000 opera tors, including over 410 in China (Hong Kong included), more than 270 in India, around 140 in Europe, around 60 in North America and around 120 in the rest of the world.16 In the pharmaceutical value chai n, three main archetypes compet e in the process development and manufacture of APIs: CDMOs focused on the manufacture of APIs (such as Pharmazell and Bachem), integrated CDMOs offering both the manufacture of dr ug substances (APIs) and drug products (such as Lonza and Siegfried), and pharmaceutical companies th at have an adjacent CDMO for third parties in addition to their captive business (such as Pfizer CentreOne or Teva API). Among the 20 largest players in APIs, which share a pproximately 15% of the merchant market with a value of \u20ac72 billion, EUROAPI is positioned as the l eading global manufacturer of small molecules (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation and HP-APIs), the world's second-largest manufacturer of APIs (including small molecules and large molecules) after Lonza, 17 and the seventh largest in the global CDMO market in 2020.18 The Group stands out from its competitors with one of the broadest portfolios of APIs in the industry (around 200 APIs), including a large portion of APIs with high specificity, due to a wide panel of innovative technologies. Market characteristics The competitive positions of the players are relativel y secure due to the market's following features: commercialization of the APIs is heav ily regulated by health authorities: detailed and costly technical documentation with long registration timeframes (from nine to 40 months to qualify a new API source not yet certified), with six key steps: (i) evaluation and planning, (ii) transmission of samples, (iii) the test of pilot batches at laboratory scale to verify the product's specifications, (iv) industrialization of the pro cess for the manufacture of commercial lots, (v) stability tests for the first commercial batches and (vi) registration with authorities before production of an API. Certain APIs marketed by the Group are the subject of a large number of regulatory dossiers: for example, Latanoprost and Sevelamer are the subject of over 50 and 60 dossiers respectively. Manufacturing sites are subject to intense vigilance with regular inspections by health authorities and customer s, and are subject to different regulatory obligations depending on the region of the world; these obligations evolve over time and require ongoing work to ensure compliance at all times; significant requirements that prioritize long-term relationships with suppliers known for their quality and reliability of supply : the process of changing a supplier is long and requires a financial investment of several hundred thousand euros. It is usually done when the supplier in place runs into recurring problems of supply quality or reliability (for example, if delivery 15 Sources: Analyses conducted from Capital IQ and MergerMarket databases; FDA (Food and Drug Administration) Drug Quality Inspections; press releases of rival companies; Company information; analyses performed by brokers on the competitive landscape using pu blic data about the competing companies; interviews with experts on the API market conducted early in 2021 16 Source : Information collected from the Newport Thomson database. 17 EUROAPI holds a share of approximately 1.2% of the global API market while Lonza holds a market share of approximately 2.6%, the majority of which consists of biologics. 18 Sources : Company's estimate based on third-party market research conducted using the annual reports published by the main industrial players in the APIs sect or, public databases (including Capital IQ and Orbis) as well as interviews with market experts. 64 deadlines are missed), when the a lternative source offers significantly lower prices, or when the customer wants to diversify its supply sources (for example, by looking for a Western source); the industrial excellence necessary to propose a competitive offer: an upstream investment and heavy startup costs are necessary to establish production of APIs. Only sufficient critical size allows attractive prices and viable margins. In fact, certain infrastructure costs at the sites, such as the purification sites, cannot be reduced, and give a competitive advantage to large sites. It is also crucial to have specific technological expertise with control of complex industrial processes with long cycles. The competitive landscape is continually evolving around the major trends described below: 1. Outsourcing of the supply of APIs: the pharmaceutical companies are increasingly outsourcing the supply of APIs, which gives them better control over their supply, allows them to vary their production costs via a contractual relationship, make suppliers compete with each other and outsource a portion of their carbon footprin t. This is a trend already seen in R&D with CROs (Contract Research Organization). 2. Streamlining of suppliers: pharmaceutical companies are increasingly concerned about the security of their supplies due to a number of disrup tions in supplies of drugs essential to patients, the end market's tension on drug prices, a nd shorter R&D cycles for new drugs; new projects are increasingly proposed only to a limited list of large-scale suppliers with a broad portfolio of APIs (\"one-stop shops\"). 3. Consolidation through mergers & acquisitions: mergers & acquisitions are at the center of the development strategies of suppliers of APIs because they make the use and marketing of technologies already in the market or new technologies immediate in contrast to the construction of organic capacities. The trend is toward an integrated positioning over all technologies. As a result, the competitive landscape is becoming in creasingly consolidated, and about 80 merger- acquisition transactions were completed between 2010 and 2021 by the 20 largest players in APIs. 19 4. Increased demand for premium APIs : certain APIs such as pep tides and oligonucleotides are increasingly in demand from pharmaceutical laborat ories and biotechnology companies due to the possibilities offered by their specification and complexification. 5. Increased interest in manufacturers with high social, environmental and quality standards : pharmaceutical companies are placing increasing importance on compliance by manufacturers of APIs used in finished medicines with high and demanding social, environmental and quality performance standards. 6. A growing number of opportunities for Western manufacturers: recurring quality problems and supply disruptions at manufacturers in countr ies with low production costs (India and China, for example) are triggering changes in the s upply strategy of pharmaceutical companies, which are moving toward a multi-source purchasing stra tegy that is resulting in relocations of operations to Western countries. For example, in 2019, 56% of FDA inspections of Chinese manufacturers and 47% of inspections of Indian manufacturers concluded with observations of serious problems, compared to 34% of inspections of Western manufacturers. In particular, 9% of inspections of Chinese manufacturers and 7% of inspections of Indian manufacturers resulted in critical level observations, compared to 3% of inspections of Western manufacturers. The Group considers that large-scale Western suppliers are better positioned to take advantage of this trend and gain market share. 19 Source : analyses completed from Capital IQ and MergerMarket public databases. 65 Building on its position as the world's leading manuf acturer of small molecules (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemistry molecu les derived from fermentation and HP-APIs) and the world's second-largest manufacturer of APIs (includi ng small molecules and large molecules) in 2021 and on its strategic goals, the Group c ould participate in the trend toward consolidation in its reference market, which remains particularly fragmented, and may plan acquisitions to acquire additional technologies or exposure in new markets. In this context, the Group may also benefit from a healthy balan ce sheet to successfully complete consolidation operations. 6.2.4 Impact of COVID-1920 In the short term, the pharmaceutical industry pr oved its strong resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the demand side, the industry saw sudd en increases in the demand for certain medicines, particularly two APIs manufactured by the Gro up: high demand for Dexamethasone after it was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for serious COVID-19 cases, and a strong temporary increase in the price and volumes of Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate after studies published the hypothesis of its potential efficacy against COVID-19. In contrast, suspicions of contra-indications for specific substances (such as Ibuprofen) had a negative impact on dema nd in the short term. During the year ended December 31, 2020, supply was partially disrupt ed due to lockdowns in China and India that affected production sites. In addition, some countries like India set limits on the export of certain APIs and drugs in order to secure minimum inventories of essential medicines for their national population. Due to the lack of visibility on the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmaceutical companies created inventories of APIs that were not completely used due to the decrease in certain infectious pathologies resulting from the governmental measures taken to curtail the spread of the pandemic, but also the delay on certain care consid ered to be non-essential. In 2021, the Group also saw a decline in the sales of APIs su ch as Pristinamycin, which acts primarily on certain bacterial diseases and pneumonias, the prevalence of which declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, while other APIs such as Dexamethasone recorded high demand. The Group estimates that this pandemic had generated a decrease in revenue of around \u20ac29 million on certain products for the year ended December 31, 2020. In the long term, growth in the market is not exp ected to suffer from major distortions. However, there should be a positive impact and an opportunity for West ern suppliers that are perceived as a safer supply source for drugs than suppliers in countries with low production costs. Problems with the supply of essential drugs during the first months of the pandemi c triggered major discussions about the safety of the supply, both within governments in Western countri es (as part of efforts to relocate in the European Union), and within major pharmaceutical companies. Western governments launched actions to relocate operations (for example, through public financing, re gulations, public-private pa rtnerships) in order to strengthen European health sovereignty by reloca ting a basic supply of essential drugs on domestic territory. In particular, the European Commissi on has announced the launch of a Health Important Project of Common European Interest ( Projet important d'int\u00e9r\u00eat europ\u00e9en commun , \"PIIEC\") intended to support the development of health innovations. The Group is currently positioned on six PIIEC projects, including three in France. The pharmaceuti cal companies are increasingly diversifying their sourcing strategy in order to avoi d costly supply disruptions (such as a long supply chain cycles involving many parties and potential loss of profits). This phenomenon, which ha d already begun before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, has rapidly ac celerated and created an opportunity for Western manufacturers of APIs with a high level of vertical in tegration to win contracts in markets historically dominated by suppliers in countries with low production costs. 20 Sources: BCC - Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Global Markets, January 2021; HBW Insight - COVID Impact on US Health and Wellness, March 2021; Reuters - Global supplier India curbs drug exports as coronavirus fears grow, March 2020; interviews with experts in the API market conducted early in 2021; press releases from companies operating in the API market; Company information. 66 6.3 Strengths and competitive advantages 6.3.1 Leading position in a large number of API categories The Group is a leading player in the API market. It est imates that, in terms of revenue, it was the world's leading manufacturer of small molecules (incl uding complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemistry molecules derived from fermentatio n and HP-APIs) and the world's second-largest manufacturer of APIs (including small molecules and large molecules) in 2021, and the seventh-largest in the global CDMO market in 2020.21 The Group's sites are on average 2.5 times larger than its Western competitors, in terms of averag e production and employees per site.22 For example, the Frankfurt site is the largest API production site in Europe, with approximately 865 m3 of fine chemistry reactors.23 Moreover, the Group considers that all of its sites have sufficient scale and appropriate infrastructures to allow it to be production-cost competitive. The Group also has the largest market share in a number of key API categories, such as the market for prostaglandins, where it is the world's leading manufacturer.24 The Group's positioning for each of the main categories of APIs that it manufactures is presented below: - prostaglandins: the world's leading APIs pr alkaloids (including non-narcotic opioids and op iates): world leader in the market of the following key APIs: Codeine, Morphine, Noscapine, Naltrexone and world leader in Apomorphine and Naloxone markets. The Group markets opiates in particular in France, Canada and Japan, but not in the United States; - vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamines) a nd its salt derivatives: the third largest in the market and the only Western manufacturer; and - steroids: world leader and only fully vertically integrated European supplier of APIs for the following key corticosteroid categories: Pre dnisolone, Methylprednisolone, Dexamethasone, Hydrocortisone and Spironolactone. In addition to these categories of APIs for which the Group has a leading market position, the Group also holds a strong position in the following categories of APIs: 25 - anti-infectives: market l eader : Company's estimate based on third-party market research conducted using the annual reports published by the main industrial players in the APIs sect or, public databases (including Capital IQ and Orbis) as well as interviews with market experts. 22 Source : Comparison made on the basis of data obtained by experts in the market on average production and number of people per site. 23 Source : Company's estimate based on the market research conducted by third parties and interviews with market experts. 24 Source : Company's estimates based on third-party market research conducted using IQVIA statistics listing revenue by API, interviews w ith API market experts conducted in early 2021 and analyst reports; IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science - Global Use of Medicine in 2019 and Outlook to 2023, January 2019. 25 Source : Company's estimates based on third-party market research conducted us ing the IQVIA database as well as interviews with experts in the API market co nducted in early 2021 and analyst reports; IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science - Global Use of Medicine in 2019 and Outlook to 2023, January 2019. 67 - antipyretics: number two in the market fo r the Group's key APIs: Metamizol Magnesium and Metamizol key APIs: Irbesartan and Olmesartan; - hyperphosphatemia: leader for the oup's following key APIs: Sevelamer Carbonate and Sevelamer Hydrochloride; - market leader for the Group's key APIs (Fexofenadine Hydrochloride); and - peptides and oligonucleotides: development and production capacities used exclusively by Sanofi until 2021 for peptides and until 2019 for o ligonucleotides and capable of supporting the CDMO business among the top ten CDMOs in th e regulated geographical areas (European Union, United Kingdom, United States and Japan). The breakdown of the Group's consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, is presented in Note D.25.3 ( Additional information ) of the notes of the consolidated financial statements. Scale is a major factor affecting competitiveness in the production of APIs and intermediates, given the large share of fixed costs in total production costs a nd the importance of industrial investments. As the world's leading manufacturer of small molecules (i ncluding complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation and HP-APIs), the Group benefits from important economies of scale, which enable it to have a competitive product portfolio, including with its competitors operating in countries with lower pro duction costs. The volume capacity of the Group's sites for certain APIs, such as Fexofenadine, Sevela mer and Irbesartan, enables it to reduce unit costs and thus to absorb a large part of sites fixed cost s. Due to continued investments, the Group has a prime position in the API market and is well positioned compar ed to its competitors in terms of product quality and diversity, regulatory compliance, supply reliability and technical support, which is reflected in the price sensitivity of the Group's products, which is lo wer than that of most of its competitors' products. 6.3.2 Strong vertical integration offering gr eater autonomy and security of supply The Group considers that it has greater vertical inte gration than its main European competitors, enabling it to supply its customers with more APIs manuf actured from intermediates produced by the Group and derived from largely commoditized basic raw materials. It is thus less depende nt on countries with low production costs for the purchase of b asic and advanced intermediates.26 For example, it has a very high rate of vertical integration for anti-infectives, alkalo ids, salts derived from vitamin B12, corticosteroids, prostaglandins and hyperphosphatemia (greater than or equal to 90%), and a very advanced rate of integration for the other categories of APIs (greater than or equal to 60%). A supply chain program was designed to guarantee transparent processes throughout the value chain to deliver APIs to the Group's customers within the required timeframes, by ta rgeting APIs used in the composition of essential medications and/or medications of vital importance. The principal components will focus on responsible supply initiatives, including codes of conduct and audi ts of the principal suppliers, as well as the program to end single sourcing. A partnership will be establis hed by the Group and PSCI in order to further share supplier audits, implement a supplie r code of conduct and plans for sustainable supply training for Group employees responsible for the supply. The Group considers that its vertical integration provides it with greater reliability of supply and manufacturing and a superior quality positioning, give n the application of good manufacturing practices (GMP) for the production of most of the raw materi als and basic and advanced intermediates used by the Group, as well as cost control due to the large numbe r of potential suppliers for basic intermediates. 26 Source : Company's estimates based on interviews with experts in the API market conducted in early 2021. 68 The Group considers that this vertical integration constitutes a significant co mpetitive advantage in its markets. The Group owns, controls and integrates almost all of the main chemical technologies used for the manufacturing of APIs, spread over its six production s ites. These sites are specia lized in differentiated and complementary technologies in chemistry and biofermentation, which enable the Group to industrialize new molecules for its customers. Th e technological capacities of the Group's sites are presented in Section 6.3.3 \" Manufacturing excellence and innovation platform \" of the Prospectus. Due to its production platform located in Europe and th e large size of its multi-technology sites, which facilitate the development of pr ocesses and industrialization aimed at introducing new products on the production sites, the Group also considers that it has the necessary attributes to be a leading candidate in the event of the relocation of the production of certain APIs to Europe. The Group's teams have thus established several complementary projects related to the technological platforms of its industrial sites in order to respond to governmental and European initiatives to relocate in Europe. These projects aim to secure the supply of intermedia tes and mature APIs of major th erapeutic interest through process innovation in order to ensure competitive, divers ified, secure and environmentally sustainable production in Europe. They are based primarily on: - a project to produce Erythromycin, a molecule and key product for the family of second- generation macrolides (Azithromyci n, Clarithromycin, etc.) using the integrated bioproduction platform for antibiotics and vitamin B12 at the sites in Brindisi (Italy) and Vertolaye and Saint- Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf (France) and a project to expand vitamin B12 production capacity at Saint- Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf; - an integration project relating to the production of key intermediate chains of corticosteroids before manufacture at the platform of the Vertolaye site with breakthrough technological innovations; - the development of the integrated prostaglandi n production platform, including all stages of synthesis of intermediates and finished products necessary for the manufacture of molecules of the prostaglandin family, at the Ujpest site (H ungary) with a project to expand prostaglandin production capacities; - the study of breakthrough processes for the pro duction of large volumes of mature complex chemical synthesis molecules su ch as Metamizole, Ramipril, Ketoprofen and Furosemide at its Frankfurt site (Germany); - the development of capacity for the development and production of HP-APIs at the Ujpest site (Hungary); - capacities for development and production at in dustrial scale of solid phase and liquid phase complex peptides and oligonucleotides at the Frankfurt site (Germany); and - the manufacture of therapeutic nanoparticles at industrial scale using the micronization and spray drying platforms at the Vertolaye (F rance) and Haverhill (United Kingdom) sites. These projects are long-term initiatives with strong R&D components, the conclusion of which is not yet known at the date of the Prospectus. These in itiatives are therefore not included in the Group's projections on the same date. These projects aim to make it possible to sustainabl y produce these molecules in Europe and to develop more cost competitive products in a more environm entally friendly manner through the development of new chemical synthesis routes. These objectives can be achieved only by leveraging the disruptive innovation brought about by the principles of green chemistry, including resource minimization and energy input reduction, and by using key new technol ogies such as synthetic biology, flow chemistry 69 and biocatalysis. The Group's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) policy is described in detail in Section 6.9 \" ESG Policy \" of the Prospectus. Finally, the Group also considers that the risks associated with its pr ocurement strategy are limited, as its top ten raw material suppliers accounted for 31% of raw material expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021, while 47% of the Group's raw material expenditures we re from dual or multiple sources. Moreover, raw materials used by the Group sourced from China or India accounted for 28% of the Group's total raw material expenditure for the y ear ended December 31, 2021, compared to 59% for raw materials sourced from Europe. 6.3.3 Manufacturing excellence and innovation platform The Group benefits from a wide range of technologies a llocated to its six production sites, each of which benefits from appropriate investments and an experienced development team. Group's technological capacities by production site 1 Fine chemical reactors The Group's production capacities have benefited from regular investments enabling it to support its growth plan until 2025. The Group anticipates that the average net occupancy rate at its sites,27 which was around 70% in 2020 and about 68% in 2021,28 will increase in the coming years, primarily due to the increase in the CDMO activities and the developm ent of additional volumes in its API Solutions business, while investing in certain families of APIs for which world demand exceeds production capacity. The Group's future investments (some of which mu st still be approved by the Company's Board of Directors as of its transformation into a French public limited company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme )) will be 27 The net occupancy rate of the Group's sites is calculated from the reference capacity, which corresponds to nominal capacity (taking into account effective working hours at the sites and excluding production capacities that have been completely closed) adju sted for a standard efficiency rate. For a production site, it represents the ratio of the sum for all sites' workshops (i) of the occu pancy rate of each workshop multiplied by the number of equipment in the workshop (ii) over the total number of equipment at the site. 28 The Group estimates that the optimal maximum occu pancy rate is 85% to 90% to ensure maintenance and to be able to increase production to absorb last-minute needs. 70 focused on the development of new production capaciti es dedicated to the Group's families of key APIs and for which the Group considers that its capacities will reach saturation in the coming years within the framework of its expansion strategy. These investments will mainly include: 1. at the Vertolaye site, the design and construction of a new production workshop dedicated to the production of HP-APIs hormones, with th e objective of reaching an annual production capacity of more than ten tons by 2025 (compare d to a maximum annual capacity of six to seven tons per year in 2021); during the intermediate period, the increase in production can be ensured by existing installations to be op timized and adapted to the need s of production in the context of the CDMO activities. 2. the increase in prostaglandin production capacity at the Ujpest site as the portfolio and order volumes grow, through the construction of a new building and gradual employee recruitment in order to multiply prostaglandin production capac ity by four in order to achieve a production volume of up to two tons; 3. the construction of new chromatography facilities at the Frankfurt site with the objective of increasing the Group's downstream processing capacity (purification, downstream process) of peptides and oligonucleotides to 100 kilograms per year by 2024 (compared with a maximum capacity of 15 to 17 kilograms per year in 2021). 4. the implementation at the Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbe uf site of a new vitamin B12 fermentation process with the objective of increasing the Group's production capacity by 25% to 50% by 2024 to reach a volume of up to 20 tons as well as a reduction in the cost of sales of approximately 25% and a reduction of the Group's industrial and environmental footprint; 5. the adaptation and transformation of the existi ng spray drying capacities at Haverhill, as well as the construction of new capacities in order to o ffer a range line of capacities and expertise in this technology; and 6. construction of purification capacities at the biof ermentation pilot scale at the Brindisi site. The Group also benefits from an innovative scientific development team that continuously improves the manufacturing processes for APIs in order to increase industrial yields and reduce production costs. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 330 employe es from the Group's Research and Development (R&D) team, including about 90 employees entirely dedi cated to the CDMO activities, were spread over the Group's six sites covering the Group's five R&D missions (CDMO, manufacturing process improvement, support to production for continuous process improvement and compliance programs, extension of the portfolio of its API Solutions bu siness through the integratio n of new products, and other scientific expertise services to support the qua lity and regulatory affairs departments). The Group has initiated a program to recruit qualified persons to accelerate the development of its activities in CDMO and is planning the recruitment of more than 100 employees who hold PhDs in science fields or who are engineers, with the goal of raising the num ber of employees on its R&D teams to approximately 575 in 2025, including more than 250 employees on the development teams dedicated to the CDMO activities. In the peptide and oligonucleotide segment, the Group c onsiders itself to be one of the only operators in the market to have the necessary capacities for ma nufacturing complex conjugate products. Since 2010, around 30% of the peptides entering the clinical de velopment phase have been conjugates. Given the growing complexification of the peptides to make them more selective, the molecules conjugation technology appears to be determinant. Principa l peptide conjugation methods include peptides conjugated with a protein (i.e., 27% of the total sh are of conjugated peptides), with a lipid (24%), 71 combined peptides (15%), pegylated peptides (13%) and small molecules conjugation (11%).29 For example, the combined applications and proce dures show increasing therapeutic effectiveness of conjugation with small molecules.30 The Group considers itself to be well positioned in the conjugation of complex peptides and oligonucleotides due to its so lid technical expertise and its main differentiating factors, including (i) diversified technologies enablin g it to complete conjugation operations using its own capacities without using outside partners; (ii) knowledge and capacity in the area of conjugation and innovative synthesis sub-units, which facilitate conjugation; and (iii) extensive experience with several solid phase conjugated APIs. In addition, the Group benefits from internal capab ilities and intends to take advantage of external opportunities to continue to be a leader in innova tion. In order to monitor and take advantage of technological advances, it will set up a scientific committee and will be s upported by continuous collaboration with numerous university and academic partners in Europe and private R&D companies. As of the date of the Prospectus, the Group h as entered into 17 R&D partnerships relating to manufacturing processes, six in France, two in Austria, Switzerland and Germany, and is negotiating more than 15 partnerships across Europe. Finally , initiatives have been put in place to continuously monitor potential acquisition opportunities and to remain at the forefront of innovations. 6.3.4 Excellence in regulatory and quality performance The Group's production sites are regularly inspected by several health regulatory authorities, such as the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") in the United States, the Europ ean Medicines Agency (\"EMA\") or European national agencies such as the Fr ench National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products ( Agence Nationale de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 du M\u00e9dicament et des produits de sant\u00e9 -\"ANSM\"), with a track record that the Group considers exempl ary in terms of compliance with regulations, in particular GMP rules, and quality.31 As a result, the most recent regulatory inspections carried out on each of the Group's sites by the FDA and the EMA did not reveal any critical observations.32 Moreover, between 2018 and 2021, more than 150 audits conducted by customers have confirmed the quality level of the Group's sites.33 All processes for the manufacturing of APIs at the Group's sites are certified as GMP compliant. The Group has put in place a proactive methodology to assess and prevent the risks of nitrosamines in its products. Thus, the risk analysis relating to th e presence of mutagenic impurities of the nitrosamine family conducted between 2018 and 2021 by Sanofi and the Group has shown that there is no risk for some of the APIs produced by the Group (in partic ular the absence of Nitrosodimethylamine and Nitrosodiethylamine impurities for sartans such as Irbesartan and Olmesartan Medoxomil) or, for other ingredients, has allowed the implementation of remedi ation plans to detect the presence of nitrosamines and to develop a methodology to proactively assess and mitigate nitrosamine-related risks. The Group will also continue to proactively assess the risk of mutagenic impurities in its key APIs over the next five years in accordance with the International C ouncil for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guideline M7(R1) on assessment and control of DNA reactive (mutagenic) impurities in pharmaceuticals to limit poten tial carcinogenic risk. This expertise will enable the Group to ensure risk control and develop a comp etitive advantage over its competitors by offering its pharmaceutical customers regulatory files that comply with the current requirements of the authorities. 29 Sources: Therapeutic peptides: Histor ical perspectives, current developmen t trends, and future directions by Jolene L.

Plowright - July 2017. 31 Source : Company's estimate based on interviews with expe rts in the API market conducted in early 2021. 32 The Frankfurt site was the subject of non-critical level observation following an inspection, which is now closed. 33 The Group considers an audit to be successful when it does not result in the loss of a customer. 72 As of the date of the Prospectus, the Group has a br oad portfolio of files and certifications, including 69 Certificates of Suitability to the European Pharmaco poeia (\"CEP\"), 50 files filed with the FDA (Drug Master File, \"DMF\") and 46 Japanese Drug Master Files (\"JMF\") filed with the Japanese health authority. The Group considers its level of reliability34 to be higher than that of its Western competitors, with a 98% average rate of on-time deliveries to the Group's sites, compared with 95% to 97% for its Western competitors. The Group's ambition is for all its sites to obtai n ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 (b est environmental and energy practices) certifications by 2023 at the lat est. The Group has also defined certain objectives in terms of social and environmenta l responsibility (see Section 6.9 \" ESG Policy \" of the Prospectus). 6.3.5 Broad and diversified portfolio of APIs35 As of the date of the Prospectus, the Group has one of the largest portfolios in the industry, consisting of approximately 200 APIs for its API Solutions business and CDMO activities, and covering each of the 14 anatomical therapeutic classifications defi ned by the World Health Organization (\"WHO\"). The Group's activity covers all types of molecules in th e API market: small molecules (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemistry mol ecules derived from fermentation and HP-APIs) and large molecules (such as the pep tides and oligonucleotides). For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Group's top ten APIs accounted for 35.0% of its cons olidated revenue, while the top 53 APIs accounted for 80.0% of its consolidated revenue. The Group is positioned in differentiated categories of APIs. A market is considered differentiated when it is a niche market or, in case of strong scale or e fficiency requirements, wh en a specific chemical complexity exists, or when the value chain is cons idered to be complex. Approximately 55% of the Group's sales are generated from highly differentiated36 APIs, mainly biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation, HP-APIs, large molecules (such as peptides and oligonucleotides) and some complex chemical synthesis molecules. The Group anticipates a faster growth curve in sales and higher margins for the portion of its portfolio composed of diffe rentiated APIs compared with the non-differentiated portion. It considers that its portfolio of APIs has a good balance between niche and/or complex-to- manufacture substances, representing approximately 90% of the Group's sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, and high-volume APIs that can par tially absorb the fixed costs of sites, representing approximately 10% of the Group's sales. The Group be nefits from strong positions in families of APIs with significant technological constraints: in particular , it ranks first in the world in the market for APIs from the prostaglandin family (inclu ding Latanoprost, Bimatoprost and Iloprost); it is a world leader in the market for key APIs from alkaloids (Codeine, Morphine, Noscapine and Naltrexone) and is the world leader in the Apomorphine and Naloxone market and a world leader in the ma rket for APIs from the following key Methylpredniso lone, Dexamethasone, Hydrocortisone and Spironolactone; it is third in the world in the market for vitamin B12 and its solid salt derivatives and the sole Western producer to have manufactured peptides, w ith more than 40 years of experience at its Frankfurt site.37 34 Source : customer and industry interviews, 2019 internal customer survey . 35 Source : Official list of the WHO ATC (A natomical Therapeutic Chemical) classification system, Official list of medicines of the WHO - 2019; Official list of essential medicines of the ANSM (French National Agency for the Safety of Drugs and Health Products - Agence nationale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du m\u00e9dicament et des produits de sant\u00e9 ) - 2013; Company's estimates based on third-party market studies conducted using public databases, interviews with experts in the API market conducted in early 2021 and analyst reports and Company's information. 36 Source: Company's estimates based on market studies conducted by third parties established with the help of interviews with experts in the API market conducted in early 2021. 37 Source : IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science - Global Use of Medicine in 2019 and Outlook to 2023, January 2019, IQVIA statistics that list revenue by API; PharmaCompass public database providing market data on APIs based on specific needs. 73 Directional segmentation of the Group's portfolio of APIs 1 Anti-infectives: some anti-infectives require only a few steps of ferm entation/biochemistry. 2 Food and pharmaceuticals. 3 Steroids are also partly biochemistry mo lecules derived from fermentation to the extent that most synthetic pathways include non-chemical synthesis steps. The Group's portfolio of APIs consists largely of mo lecules that are integrated into long-established standard of care treatment protocols and are unlik ely to be replaced. Moreover, sales of APIs included in the list of essential medicines as compiled by the WHO (World Health Organization) (2019) and the ANSM (2013) represent 55% of the Group's restated revenue. Essential medicines, or \"medicines of major therapeutic interest\", corr espond to therapeutic proprietary medicines used primarily for care. They are characterized by a broad spectrum of use, often generic molecules and large markets spread over several continents for the manufacturer of APIs. 6.3.6 Balanced and diversified customer base The Group considers that it benefits from a well-ba lanced customer portfolio with Sanofi, which provides stability and visibility on the level of its sales, and a diversified group of loyal customers offering growth opportunities.38 Sanofi Sanofi, which represents approximately 45.6% of th e Group's consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, is a key strategic partner. By 2025, the Group projects that sales to Sanofi will represent 30% to 35% of its consolidated revenue due to the increase in the proportion of sales to other customers. The Group has entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement (the \"Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement\") for APIs with Sanofi Winthrop Industrie, a Sanofi group affiliate, effective October 1, 2021, for a period of five years after the date of the Company's initial listing, renewable by mutual agreement of the parti es and exclusive on a major portion of the products. Section 18.3.1 \"Manufacturing and supply agreements for certain APIs\" of the Prospectus contains a description of the main provisions of the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. The Group is also a key strategic partner of Sanofi; it thus supplied, in terms of revenue, around 30% of the APIs purchased by the Sanofi group in the year ended December 31, 2020, including the APIs necessary for the production of 21 of Sanofi's key drugs (such as Fexofenadine, which is used in the manufacture of Allegra, an over-the-counter antihis tamine, or Lixisenatide, the API in Soliqua, an injectable drug for Type 2 diabetes). For the year e nded December 31, 2021, the principal APIs in terms of revenue recorded with the Sanofi group were Se velamer, Fexofenadine, Pristinamycine, Irbesartan, 38 Sources: Company's estimates based on interviews with experts in the API market conducted in early 2021, IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science - Global Use of Medicine in 2019 and Outlook to 2023, January 2019, IQVIA statistics that list revenue per API. 74 Codeine phosphate and Hydroxychloroquine sulfate. The Group is also a CDMO partner of choice for Sanofi due to the signature on October 1, 2021, of a Master Agreement for Development and GMP Manufacturing Services (as de fined in Section 18.3.2 \" Special Agreements between the Group and the Sanofi group relating to the development of APIs \" below) with Sanofi under the terms of which each of the parties acts both, and as applicable, as provider or as beneficiary of services relating to the development and/or improvement of processes to manu facture certain APIs or intermediates. The Group is notably engaged in approximately ten projects to develop and/or manufacture new molecular entities in the Sanofi's R&D portfolio, including an interm ediate of Tolebrutinib currently in Phase 3 for multiple sclerosis following the Pr incipia Biopharma acquisition by Sanof i in 2020, the peripheral chain and ligand of Tusamitamab ravtansine, an antibody- drug conjugate currently in Phase 3 in non-small cell lung cancer, or the development of a cationic lipid for certain messenger RNA vaccines being developed by Sanofi Pasteur. Section 18.3.2 \"Special agreements between the Group and the Sanofi group relating to the development of APIs\" of the Prospectus contains a description of the main provisions of the development agreement. The Group and Sanofi also signed a Distribution Agreem ent, effective as of October 1, 2021, as amended on February 25, 2022, under the terms of which the Company agrees to distribute 22 APIs belonging to the Sanofi group, as a non-exclusive distributor (see Section 18.3.3 \" Distribution agreements for certain APIs \" of the Prospectus). Other customers For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales to other Group customers represented 54.4% of the Group's consolidated revenue. The Group projects that revenue drawn from its sales to other customers will represent 65% to 70% of its consolidated revenue by 2025. It sells its produc ts to a diversified base of around 530 longstanding customers, including most of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies (approximately 275 customers, including Boehring er Ingelheim and Alfasigma), generic drug manufacturers (approximately 45 customers, including Teva), animal health products manufacturers (approximately 15 customers, including MSD Animal Health, Ceva), consumer health and nutrition products companies (approximately 165 customers, including DSM), biotech companies (approximately 20 customers, including Mithra , SQY Therapeutics, Ranco Santa (Catalent) and distribution comp anies (approximately 15 customers). For the year ended December 31, 2021, the top ten customers (e xcluding Sanofi) represen ted 24.1% of the Group's consolidated revenue, while 80% of the Group's cons olidated revenue was generated by 87 customers (excluding Sanofi). The Group's customers (excluding Sanofi) who purchase their APIs on an exclusive basis, i.e., as the sole source of supply listed in their regulatory f ile for a given drug, repr esented approximately 32.9% of the Group's consolidated revenue for the y ear ended December 31, 2 021 (excluding Sanofi). The Group has also maintained commercial relationships for more than 20 years with most of its top 20 customers (relationships of ten to 20 years with around 10% of its customers, and five to ten years with around 30% of its customers). The Group has record ed a revenue attrition of less than 1% per year due to the loss of customers between 2016 and 2020. 39 Apart from a privileged relationship based on the Group's performance and knowledge of its customers a nd their needs, these long-term relationships are also explained by the high transfer costs and the long transition period in the event of a change in suppliers. The Group has calculated that the average return on investment period associated with a change of API suppliers is more than one year, c onsidering an investment of several hundred thousand euros in view of the regulatory context and the registration requirement. 39 The attrition rate is calculated by dividing the amoun t of the sales to customers lost by the total amount of the Group's sales. The Company considers a customer to be lost when no sale has been made with this customer for two consecutive years. The Company does not expect a significant change in this rate after taking into account the results for the year ended December 31, 2021. 75 Given these commercial dynamics, Group custom ers rely on purchase orders that represented approximately 75% of the restated revenue from its API Solutions business as of December 31, 2021 (excluding Sanofi); the Group has formalized contractua l relations with its customers in other cases. In the future, the Group intends to formalize the relati onship with its customers further through contracts rather than purchase orders. Within the framework of its CDMO activities, all commercial relations between the Group and its customers are formalized by contract. The Group considers that it has competitive advantages that will allow it to benefit from the growth of the market for medicines including the Group's APIs because its major customers are experiencing very dynamic growth in their respective markets. Additionally, the Group considers that there are cro ss-selling opportunities within its current customer base. In fact, the average number of APIs supplie d to the Group's customers is increasing: a limited number of customers representing 53.6% of the Gro up's restated revenue (excluding Sanofi) purchased four or more APIs in 2021, while 80% to 90% of the customers purchased fewer than four APIs and 60% of the customers purchased only one API, which increases cross-selling opportunities in the future. According to the Company's estimate, the average number of APIs sold per customer is expected to increase by more than 10% by 2025. 6.3.7 Strong positioning in the CDMO market with higher potential margins Revenue from the Group's CDMO activities represented 24.9% of its consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which 16.8% was fo r customers other than Sanofi and 7.9% was for Sanofi. The Group, which ranked seventh in the global CDMO market in 2020, considers it has a solid foothold in this business activity a nd substantial room for growth gi ven the limited resources allocated to this activity in the past and the integration with in the Sanofi group, with the ambition of entering the top five CDMO companies worldw ide in terms of sales by 2025. The Group is increasingly moving toward CDMO partnerships in the early phases of th e drug development cycle in order to benefit from greater customer loyalty due to the Group's position as the first supplier in terms of precedence. These partnerships have the potential to generate higher margins based on the complexity of manufacturing and the growth potential of APIs throughout the life cycle of the products of the Group's customers. It also seeks to generate a significant number of c ontracts for drugs in comme rcial phases to mitigate the risk of attrition from the molecules development cy cles that may not reach the commercial phase. In order to secure their supply of APIs and be able to respond to the increase in sales during the commercial phase, the Group's customers sometimes use additiona l suppliers whose margin levels are generally lower than those of the CDMO partners. The Group can capitalize on promising partnerships, such as those with Sanofi, Catalent, Mithra and SQY Ther apeutics, to further develop its CDMO activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Group' s CDMO activities also experienced an upturn, with 23 contracts signed, about 35% of which were with new customers, covering its four main technologies, i.e., nine projects in preclinical/phase I, five projects in phase II, four projects in phase III and five projects in commercial phase. Since the beginning of 2022, the Group has won three other projects. In the context of its CDMO activities, th e Group will have to simultaneously manage a certain number of API manufacturing projects at different c linical stages of development on behalf of its customers in order to take into account the natural a ttrition of clinical developm ent projects inherent in the pharmaceutical sector. As of the date of th e Prospectus, the Group's companies hold around 48 projects in their portfolio, over half of which are in the commercial phase. In order to grow its market share, the Group plans to continue to develop its capabilities dedicated to cutting-edge technologies (such as HP-APIs, peptid es and oligonucleotides, and micronization), to transition to a customer-centric model made possible by its autonomy from the Sanofi group, to strengthen its commercial and operational organizati on dedicated to the CDMO activities, to improve the evaluation and monitoring of CDMO projects, and to boost the commercial competitiveness of its offers (see Section 6.4.2 \" Capitalize on innovation and development to accelerate the reorientation of the portfolio toward the CDMO activities, particular ly in the peptide and oligonucleotide segment \" of the Prospectus). In the peptides and oligonucleotid es segment, the efforts made by the CDMO sales 76 team over the past nine months have begun to bear fruit with the signature of new contracts. Eight contracts have already been signed (pre-clinical phase and clinical phases 1 to 3) during the past nine months. The five main technological pillars of the CDMO activities development are the following: Peptides and oligonucleotides, benefiting from an integrated offer with unique historical expertise in post-synthesis conjugation, innovativ e ligands and customization at in sub-units of oligonucleotide chain synth esis; and a mastery of production technologies that enable it to achieve failure rates signifi cantly lower than the av erage for CDMOs for the manufacturing of batches of APIs, with the Group estimating its failure rate for peptides to be at 5%, whereas the average failure rate for CDMOs is 20%.40 Chemical synthesis at the Vertol aye, Ujpest and Frankfurt sit es, with a range of technologies enabling more than 95% of the chemical reactions to be carried out in volumes that can reach industrial levels equal to or greater than those of the main CDMOs in the sector; a portfolio of customers whose projects are currently in various stages of development, already established at the Group's different production sites; and an existing list of opportunities currently being evaluated or negotiated, spread across the United States, Europe and Asia, including biotechnology companies and pharmaceutical laboratories of all sizes. Microbial fermentation at the Brindisi and Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf sites for the production of complex chemical synthesis mol ecules, with large capacities and a strong commercial pipeline (including for antibiotics and vitamins), which can also be used to prod uce molecules such as recombinant proteins, plasmids or enzymes. Particle engineering at the Vertolaye and Have rhill sites, with the ambition of becoming a key player in solid state chemistry by capitalizing on spray-drying facilities and by creating a center of excellence for the solid state phase of sm all-scale development (nanoparticles) for the development of the process up to the industrial phase through intermediate size productions for pilot tests; and HP-APIs at the Brindisi (fermentation), Vertolay e and Ujpest sites, with additional capacity from 2023 to prepare for the development of fu ture large-scale products. Certain hormones are part of the HP-APIs portion (OEB5 class). A gr owing number of active molecules for oncology are considered as HP-APIs, even cytotoxic. The Group is therefore in a position to propose a co mplete range of services covering development from the pre-clinical phase up to the commercial phase, an d including analytic methods validation, scaling up of production from pilot level to marketing, and competitive prices with a potential for improvement due to the occupancy rate optimization at the Group's sites. 6.4 Strategy and objectives In terms of revenue, the Group considers itself to be the world's leading manufacturer of small molecules (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation and HP-APIs), the second largest manufacturer of APIs (including small molecules and large molecules) in 2021, and the seventh largest in the global CDMO market in 2020. Its priority strategy is to strengthen its position in the market for small molecules through th ree main vectors: (i) accelerate revenue growth of its existing portfolio operated within its API So lutions business; (ii) increase the exposure of its API 40 Source: The Journal of Organic Chemistry - Sustainability Challenges in Peptide Synthesis and Purification: From R&D to Production by Albert Isidro-Llobet (GSK), Martin N. Kenworthy (AstraZeneca), Gallou (Novartis), Austin G. Smith (Amgen), and Frank Roschangar (Boehringer Ingelheim) - March 2019 . 77 portfolio to its CDMO activities, i.e., manufacture for a customer that holds the intellectual property of the manufactured API; and (iii) expand its presence in the most differentiated and most complex APIs, by relying on a set of tools and technological expertise held by the Group. These strategic vectors are aimed at the following th ree objectives: (i) generate approximately 35% of its revenue via CDMO activities by 2025 (24.7% in 2 021) through above-market gr owth in this activity up to 2025 and (ii) reduce the weight of Sanofi in the Group's total revenue with the goal of reaching about 30% to 35% of its consolidated revenue by 2025 (versus 45.6% in 2021), primarily through greater-than-market growth in sales to other customer s, resulting in (iii) an improvement in the Group's operating margin with a Core EBITDA margin gr eater than 20% by 2025 (ver sus a restated Core EBITDA margin of 12.3% in 2021). The Group also intends, first, to pursue a strong en vironmental and societal commitment within the framework of its ESG policy and, second, to pos ition itself as a potential player in the future consolidation of the markets in which the Group is present; these markets are still very fragmented with a multitude of players around the world. To achieve its strategic objectives, the Group can draw on an efficient industrial organization, a rigorous invest ment policy and a constan tly improving financial performance. 6.4.1 Stimulate the revenue growth of the API Solutions business Building on its estimated position as the world's lead ing manufacturer in small molecules (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemi stry molecules derived from fermentation and HP- APIs)41 the Group aims to accelerate the growth in re venue from its portfolio of around 165 APIs, which represented \u20ac676.0 million, or 74.9% of its restated c onsolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 (compared with \u20ac744 .3 million (77.9% of its restated revenue) and \u20ac735.2 million (82.5%) of its restated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019), in line with the growth in the API market, estimated at 2% between 2019 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and at 6% to 7% per year between 2021 and 2024. Within this portfolio, Sanofi (with which the Group r ecorded restated revenue of \u20ac369.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, i.e., 40.9% of its c onsolidated revenue) is a reference customer and a privileged partner representing a pledge of stab ility for the Group's business model. The Group is the leading manufacturer and the main distribution platform for APIs of the Sanofi Group. The Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement provides, among ot her things, for the exclusive supply to Sanofi of APIs and/or intermediates and/or other subs tances covered by the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, subject to certain excep tions, from an established list of territories. The manufacture of these high volumes has enabled the Group to reach critical size and to benefit from a level of competitiveness that it considers to be excellent. Th is level of business activity is expected to continue and to decrease slowly in line with the dynamics of the Sanof i Group's corresponding General Medicines products, while ensuring a substantial and recurring revenue st ream for the Group. In order to substantially accelerate revenue from the product offering in th e API Solutions business, the Group intends to continue its efforts to increase sales to customers ot her than Sanofi, and anticipates an increase in these sales at a higher-than-market rate, thus representing a potential expansion of its market share. In accordance with the provisions of the Distributio n agreement, Sanofi also supplies the Group with 22 APIs over the period for which the Group holds the commercial relations with the end customers. A detailed description of the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement and the Distribution Agreement is provided in Sections 18.3.1 \" Manufacturing and supply agreements for certain APIs \" and 18.3.3 \" Distribution agreements for certain APIs \" of the Prospectus. 41 Source : Company's estimate based on third-party market research conducted using the annual reports published by the main industrial players in the APIs sect or, public databases (including Capital IQ and Orbis) as well as interviews with market experts. 78 Thus, the Group plans to develop its sales in its API Solutions business around five main vectors: First, the Group's strategy will focus on an in crease in the production capacity of certain niche APIs such as prostaglandins, hormones or vita min B12, for which demand is growing strongly and exceeds the available offer, and for which the Group will make additional investments (see Section 6.8 \" Investments \" of the Prospectus). Second, the Group considers that there are cross-selling opportunities within its current customer base. In fact, the average number of APIs supplied to the Group's customers is increasing: a limited number of customers repres enting 53.6% of the Group's restated revenue (excluding Sanofi) purchased four or more APIs in 2021, while 80% to 90% of the customers purchased fewer than three APIs with additiona l opportunities to further increase cross-selling in the future. Third, the Group conducted a competitive analysis and segmentation of its customer base and intends to set up, for the first time, a sales po licy to optimize the prices of its products on the basis of the segmentation and strategic positioni ng of its customers, particularly because for more than about 75% of its customers the Group is the sole counterparty for the production of their APIs (this percentage is significantly lowe r for the manufacturers of generic drugs and the distributors) and nearly 70% of the custom ers deal with the Group via purchase orders. Fourth, the Group will accelerate prospecting for new customers, particularly in the United States and the emerging and less regulated geographic regions. Fifth, more than 20 APIs, once reserved exclus ively for Sanofi's general medicinal products, will be available for sale to other existing and potential customers, which the Company estimates could represent an additional sales potential of around \u20ac1 5 to \u20ac25 million. Finally, the Group considers that the repatriation of pr oduction in Europe in order to reduce the European Union's current dependence on non-European supplie rs, particularly from Asia, for APIs that are strategic for European public health, will promote growth in sales of products from its API Solutions business. Although the Group does not include this factor in its projections, it considers that it has the production capacity and infrastructure to benefit fr om this development and to take advantage of initiatives taken by manufacturers of finished products aimed at developing alternative sources of supply of APIs. Due to the scale of its production sites, all lo cated in Europe, as well as the size of its factories, the high quality and diversity of its portfolio of AP Is and its broad range of technologies, the Group is positioned to be a preferred player in the process of restoring the sovereignty of the manufacture of APIs in Europe (see Section 6.3.2 \" Strong vertical integration offeri ng greater autonomy and security of supply \" of the Prospectus). 6.4.2 Capitalize on innovation and developm ent to accelerate the reorientation of the portfolio toward the CDMO activities, particularly in th e peptide and oligonucleotide segment Revenue from the Group's CDMO activities represented 24.9% of the Group's consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Group intends to raise the portion of its revenue from CDMO activities to around 35% by 2025 through greater-than-ma rket growth in this activity up to 2025. Innovation is at the center of the Group's strategy. In addition to its histori cal know-how and expertise acquired over many years, the Group has a wide range of technologies spread across its six manufacturing sites. Although it considers that its site s are capable of supporting its growth strategy and offers a competitive advantage in terms of production costs due to their critical scale and technological specialization compared to the r est of the market, the Group is committed to continuous innovation in order to enhance its manufacturing processes and develop new ones. In order to stay abreast of the industry's shift toward sustainable technologies and to respond to rapidly changing customer needs, the Group plans to continue to invest in technology an d innovation in the coming years, as well as in the development of its production capacities, in order to provide quality solutions at all type of scales, 79 including on a large scale, throughout the life cy cle of its customers' products (see Section 6.3.3 \"Manufacturing excellence and innovation platform \" of the Prospectus). These investments will drive the future growth of its CDMO activities, which ha s historically been restricted to serving Sanofi's captive needs and which will be lifted as a resu lt of EUROAPI's autonomy from the Sanofi Group, while Sanofi expects to continue to outsource de velopment and manufacturing activities to the Group and to hold approximately 30% of the Company's share capital and voting rights upon completion of the Distribution in Kind and the Investment. The evolution of the relationship between EUROAPI and Sanofi has enabled the Group to initiate a process of reorientation of the portfolio toward the CDMO activities, relying in particular on the Group's position as a preferred partner for Sanofi's clinical pipe line. In fact, Sanofi is poised to be a key partner in the Group's CDMO activities for some certain APIs or intermediates due to the signing on October 1, 2021, of a development agreement (Master Agreement for Development and GMP Manufacturing Services) that covers the current and future de velopment of key molecules in the Group's CDMO activities. These partnerships cover in particular Lademirsen (treating the Alport syndrome), an intermediate of Tolebrutinib currently in Ph ase 3 for multiple sclerosis following the Principia Biopharma acquisition by Sanofi in 2020, the peripher and ligand of Tusamitamab ravtansine, an antibody-drug conjugate currently in Phase 3 in non-small cell lung cancer, or Avalglucosiddase Alfa approved by the FDA in August 2021 (Pompe disease). As of the date of the Prospectus, there are around ten projects, including one for peptides and one fo r oligonucleotides. In 2021, the Group also signed a partnership to develop a cationic liquid for certain RNA messenger vaccines in development by Sanofi Pasteur. Subsequently, by generating an increasingl y substantial share of its business with customers other than Sanofi, particularly by forming strategi c partnerships with biotech companies and large players in the pharmaceutical industry (including th e world's top ten pharmace utical companies), the Group intends to continue and to accelerate this reorie ntation of its portfolio toward CDMO in order to stimulate its growth prospects in this activity. In addition to Sanofi's contribution through approx imately ten projects being developed, the Group plans to make substantial investments to optim ize and increase its existing production capacities, in particular for peptides and oligonucleotides, hormones and prostaglandins (see Section 6.8 \"Investments \" of the Prospectus), to develop the pipeline of ongoing CDMO projects and to continue to set up a new commercial organization to generate a greater volume of business in this activity. The Group also intends to permanently manage more th an 30 projects at different stages of clinical development in order to take into account the natura l attrition of clinical deve lopment projects inherent in the pharmaceutical sector (versus 23 projects in the development phase as of the date of the Prospectus) and to reach around 35% of its revenue for the CDMO activities by 2025 due to stronger- than-market growth in this activity. CDMO activities accelerated in 2021 with the estab lishment of a dedicated commercial organization focused on non-Sanofi customers and through a greater strategic focus. As of December 31, 2021, 23 new contracts have already been signed, compar ed to six in the entire year of 2020. Since the beginning of 2022, the Group has won three other pr ojects. Over 2021, the Group received 120 requests for proposals in connection with its CDMO activity, 45% of which were for complex chemical synthesis molecules and 20% for peptides and oligonucleotid es. Nearly half of these requests came from the largest pharmaceutical and leading biotech companies. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2021, there was a five-fold increase in the number of sales meetings, a three-fold increase in the number of requests for proposals, and the number of resp onses to these requests was over three times higher than the average for these datapoints in 2019 and 2020 . These initial results are primarily due to (i) the development of the Group's strategy for this activity; (ii) the finalization of the recruitment of the 15- member sales team for the CDMO activity and th e progressive increase in the number of scientific resources related to this activity, (iii) the Group' s announcement of its independence from Sanofi and (iv) the development of a culture more geared to the customer, with the implementation of internal procedures adapted to their needs, such as the establishment of a w eekly strategy committee to report on commercial prospecting and define th e priorities for the upcoming weeks. 80 By redirecting its API portfolio to its CDMO activ ities, the Group plans to expand its service and product offering in adjacent areas and to focus on the more complex molecules and HP-API segments. This is particularly reflected in the increased deve lopment of capacities and sales of peptides and oligonucleotides, chemical synthesis, particle engi neering, and microbial fermentation, as well as in the HP-APIs segment. The Group is already present in each of these segments, has expe rtise in the chemical synthesis processes required for their manufacture, and is capable of meeting the specific technical as well as regulatory requirements. The Group considers th at it is well positioned to take advantage of the growth of these markets (benefiting from average annual growth rates of 8% to 13% between 2019 and 2024, higher than the average growth rate of the API market, estimated at 6% to 7% per year over the same period 42 despite an annual growth rate that fell to 2% between 2019 and 2021 due to the COVID- 19 pandemic)43 and aims to become one of the top five producers of peptides and the top three producers of oligonucleotides, in terms of annual production capacity, by 2025 and to achieve its objective of approximately 35% of its revenue coming from th e CDMO activities by 2025. In the CDMO activity, the fermentation segment prospecting initiated in 20 21 has encountered some success in the evaluation of promising opportunities in the anti-infectiv es adjacent markets. The Group has high-volume fermentation reactors, strong experience at its Saint- Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf and Brindisi sites and a solid positioning in the vitamin B12 market. The capital expenditures for the pilot unit required for implementation of new CDMO projects are included in the 2022 Brindisi site investment plan. With this investment, the Group's goals in fermentation woul d be strengthened as soon as the new pilot unit is commissioned in 2023. The Group plans to offer comp lete and customizable commercial solutions, promoting industrial economies of scale for these high value-added markets. The Group's experience in the field of innovation a nd development of APIs is offered as a service through its CDMO activities. These services respond to ma rket needs for new APIs being formulated in cases where development and production activities ar e outsourced, which is the case for the various markets of interest for the Group. The Group's CDMO strategy was built to respond to demand in these high growth markets (at 8% to 10% for peptid es and 12% to 14% for oligonucleotides until 2025 according to the Company's estimates). These main ly concern new APIs being developed, the manufacturing complexity of which justifies the Gr oup's expertise in development and its premium prices. This is particularly in the peptide a nd oligonucleotide markets valued at \u20ac2 billion and \u20ac500 million respectively, and which are mainly subcontracted (around 50% for the peptides in 2020 and which the Company considers will reach 65% in 2025, and 90% for the oligonucleotides).44 The Group considers it can compete with the best of the CDMOs specialized in these markets, which demand strong technological control of the manuf acturing methods and in which demand currently exceeds supply. The Group also intends to capitalize on its research and innovation skills to pursue their development in order to speed up the reorientation a nd improvement of its portfolio, in particular by expanding its presence in large molecules. For example, the peptide and oligonucleotide markets are at the frontier of the large molecules market, whic h is a development focus for the Group's CDMO activities in order to strengthen its presence in the inno vative API market. In order to complete its offer, particularly in terms of complex conjugation processes, the Group will be able to benefit from its know- how in chemistry, peptides and oligonucleotides and to combine it with innovative ligands. As of December 31, 2021, the Group will have an innovativ e development team of approximately 300 people spread over the Group's six sites, of which approxima tely 90 people are entirely dedicated to the CDMO activities and 45% are PhDs or engineers. The Group' s objective is to have more than 250 employees dedicated to the CDMO activities by 2025, of wh om about 50% of employees will have science or 42 Sources: IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science - Global Use of Medicine in 2019 and Outlook to 2023, January 2019; Technavio - Global Active Ph armaceutical Ingredient s Market, 2017-2021; ResultsHealthCare - CRO Sector - M&A Drivers and Ma rket Trends, March 2019, BCC - Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Global Markets, January 2021. 43 Source: Company's estimates based on the market research conducted by third parties using the IQVIA database. 44 Sources: Company's estimates based on market studies co nducted by their parties established with the help of interviews with experts in the API market conducted in early 2021. 81 engineering doctorates, to support growth in this segment, the integration of technologies and the expansion of the offer on complex molecules in particular. 6.4.3 Improve operating margin of the Group The large volumes of APIs being developed and pr oduced, as well as the synergies achieved within its portfolio, allow the Group to facilitate the absorption of its fixed costs. Additionally, a dedicated team is tasked to continuously improve manufacturing processes in order to increase the capacity of the Group's sites and reduce production costs. Moreover, th e reorientation of the API portfolio toward the CDMO activities, particularly toward complex molecu les that generate higher margins, is contributing to the improvement of the Group's industrial perform ance and its margins over the duration of the margin improvement plan and thereafter. At the same time, through greater autonomy from Sanofi and following completion of the Prior Reorganization Transactions, the Group has put in pl ace a clear path to allow substantial improvement of margins to approach industry levels, and a sign ificant catch-up with the sector, primarily through optimization of costs and better use of the existi ng capacities. The Group's margin improvement targets are presented in Sections 11.2 \" Medium term outlook \" and 12.2 \" Group forecasts for the year ending December 31, 2022 \" of the Prospectus. The Group's margin improvement plan is based firs t on the implementation of a program to optimize production costs initiated in 2020 and that would imply a streamlining of production costs of around 2% each year through 2025. This plan is based on a set of around 100 initiatives that include general productivity measures, measures to improve yields, reduce energy and maintenance expenses as well as other targeted measures to reduce costs (automation of processes, optimization of the use of assets). Out of a total of around 100 initiatives, approximately 60% are currently in progress, while around 25% are still to be launched, and around 15% are currently su spended or interrupted. In addition, the Group is continuously working on new projects. The real savings generated early by the Group in 2020 and in 2021 totaled \u20ac8.7 and \u20ac8.2 million. The Group's plan to improve its margins is not connected with the restructuring plan initiated by the Sanofi group as part of its \"Play to Win\" strategy. The \u20ac15.8 million in employee expenses as of December 31, 2020, which appears in Note D.18 ( Restructuring costs and similar items) of the notes of the consolidated financ ial statements provided in Chapter 19 \" Financial information\" of the Prospectus represents the contribution of the Group's employees to the total cost of the Sanofi group's restructuring program. This amount is presented as contributing to the Group's result in order to reflect the historical real costs of the Group's activities in accord ance with accepted practices. The effects of the program to restructure the Sanof i group that have no impact on the Group's financial statements have been restated from the Co mpany's alternative performance indicators. In addition, the plan to improve the Group's operati ng margin calls for generating supply efficiencies. This point is particularly reflected in the re vision of the raw materials supply processes and the optimization of maintenance contracts by giving pr iority to local supply for energy production. Finally, the program to reduce inventories will have the long-term effect of lowering inventories to industry standards, but will have a negative impact on the margin in the short term. Taking into account all these measures, the Group seeks to reach a Core EBITDA 45 margin greater than 20% by 2025 (versus a restated Core EBITDA of 12.3% in 2021). 45 Core EBITDA corresponds to EBITDA restated for restructuring and similar costs (excluding depreciation and amortization), allocations net of reversal s of unutilized provisions for environmental risks, and other items not representative of the Group's current operat ing performance or related to the effects of acquisitions or disposals. 82 6.4.4 Improve the Group's cash generation The Group plans to continue the efforts already made to improve cash generation. In addition to the improvement in profitability, this plan includes a goal to significantly reduce inventory levels, particularly through a decrease in cycle times, as we ll as through a program to optimize investments. Streamlining regulatory and maintenance investments, reinvestment in equipment, laboratories and manufacturing facilities as well as the establishm ent of an ambitious project for performance investments and growth are strategic elements in meeting the growing future demand from the Group's current or new customers. Historically, the Group's investments amounted to \u20ac8 8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, \u20ac88.4 million for the year ended Decem ber 31, 2020, and \u20ac81.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. By 2025, the Gro up plans in particular to strengthen its production capacities to support the redirection of the portfolio toward CDMO activities, by allocating available existing capacities to this activity as a priority. The Group's investment policy in coming years is discussed in Section 6.8.3 \" Main future investments \" of the Prospectus. 6.4.5 Engage in a strong environmental and societal commitment Due to an experienced management team with dive rsified backgrounds, the Gr oup seeks to generate a sustainable performance, taking into considerati on respect for extra-financial criteria and the achievement of the ESG objectives as a key priority in establishing its strategy. The goal of Group's ESG strategy is to capitalize on the solid heritage from Sanofi in sustainable development and on the responses to an internal and ex ternal survey that collect ed over 1,200 responses from different stakeholders in Marc h 2021, which led to the development of a materiality matrix of the Group's specific risks complete d by a comparative study of the ESG strategy of its peers and competitors. In assessing its environmental performance, the Group monitors the following indicators, among others: greenhouse gas emissions (direct and indirect greenhou se gas emissions related to the Group's scope 1 and scope 2 activities and the indirect emissions re lated to the Group's scope 3 value chain), gas, electricity and water consumption, and the treatment of toxic and non-toxic waste. The Group has already defined ambitious targets (som e of which are still being defined on the date of the Prospectus) concerning respect for the environmen t and the health and safety of its employees, which are described below. It plans to: Reduce its carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions related to its activiti es, including its industrial sites (scopes 1 and 2), by 30% by 2030 (from 2020), w ith the goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. Reduce its emissions of volatile organic com pounds (VOCs) resulting from the synthesis of APIs by 50% by 2025 (from 2019). Limit frequency rate of employee accidents that result in a work shutdown (LTI - Lost Time Injury) to 1.5 per 1,000,000 hours worked, and the rate of recordable work accidents (TRI - Total Recordable Injury) to 2.5 per 1,000,000 hours worked by 2025. Reach a percentage of 30% women on its expanded executive committee and among the principal executives in key Company positions by 2025. The Group's ESG policy is described in detail in Section 6.9 \" ESG Policy \" of the Prospectus. 83 6.5 Overview of Group business activity In 2021, the Group considers itself to be, in terms of revenue, the world's leading manufacturer of small molecules (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation and HP-APIs) and the world's second la rgest manufacturer of APIs (including small molecules and large molecules) as we ll as the seventh-largest in the gl obal CDMO market in 2020; it is also the largest player in the AP I market in the European Union.46 As of the date of the Prospectus, the Group mark ets approximately 200 APIs, both within its API Solutions business and its CDMO activities, to 5 30 customers in more than 80 countries. The intermediates and APIs manufactured by the Group ar e used in the composition of drugs for human or veterinary use, originator or generic. 6.5.1 Nature of the Group's business activities (a) The Group's API Solutions business In its API Solutions business, the Group offers its cu stomers a diversified portfolio of around 165 APIs, consisting of complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation and HP-APIs. The intellectual property rights to the AP Is of the Group's API Solutions business, and to manufacture the ingredients, are held by the Group or licensed by the Group and/or covered by a distribution contract. (b) The Group's CDMO activities The Group offers services to speci fic customers, that cover upstr eam development (pre-clinical phase/clinical phase 1) and downstream developmen t and production of the APIs (clinical phase 2/clinical phase 3) as well as the commercial phase. In its CDMO activities, it manufactures approximately 35 APIs or intermediates of APIs. The intellectual property rights to the APIs or intermediates of the APIs devel oped and/or manufactured by the Gr oup as part of its CDMO activities are held by the Group's customer. Upstream development of the API (pre-clinical phase/clinical phase 1) The major steps in the pre-clinical phase/clini cal phase 1 development process are the following: Completion in the laboratory of studies to beco me familiar with the process to manufacture the API resulting from the research. The transfer, development and optimization of the processes for manufacturing the API. The transfer, development and optimization of th e analytic methods that will allow control of the final quality of the API. The production of non-GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) batches used for toxicology studies (pre-clinical phase) and the development of the pharmaceutical formulation that will be used for administration in hu mans in clinical phase 1. The production of batches that comply with the GMPs in accordance with the regulatory obligations applicable to clinical phase 1 studies in humans. 46 Source : Company's estimates based on third-party market research conducted using the annual reports published by the main industrial players in the APIs sect or, public databases (including Capital IQ and Orbis) as well as interviews with market experts. 84 The completion of stability studies in order to ve rify the stability of the API and define an expiration date for the future API. This phase may take approximately four years. Laboratories that develop processes and analytic methods are primarily involved during the upstream development phase. Production at the pilot scale is performed by qualified opera tors and is generally done in restricted areas under conditions stipulated by the GMPs. The batches of APIs are analyzed and released by quality control and quality assurance for their clinical use. Downstream development of the API with the produc tion of batches intended for clinical trials and preparation of the regulatory registratio n application (clinical phase 2 and phase 3) The major steps in the development and productio n process in clinical ph ase 2 and phase 3 are the following: Bringing the manufacturing processes to an industr ial scale to cover the expanded need for APIs in clinical phase 2 and phase 3 by the required deadlines. Validation of the analytic methods to guarantee th eir reliability in the analysis of raw materials and the API. Characterization of the manufacturing processes in order to identify and ensure the reliability of the manufacturing process in its capacity to deliver an API with the required quality. The production of batches that comply with GMPs in accordance with the regulatory obligations applicable to clinical phases 2 and 3 studies in humans. The production of validation batches that will validate the process at the industrial scale, including at least three consecutive batches of APIs with the level of quality required, in accordance with the applicable regulatory obligations. Regulatory support in the preparation of the c linical regulatory and commercial registration applications that are submitted to the health aut horities before effective use of the API in clinical trials and the marketing of the ingredient (see Section 6.5.1(c) \" Associated services offered by the Group \" of the Prospectus). These phases may take approximately six years. During the downstream development and production pr ocess in clinical phases 2 and 3, the laboratories that develop processes and analytic methods are invol ved in the scaling and validation of the analytic methods. Production at the pilot and industrial scales is performed by qualified operators and is carried out in restricted industrial areas under the conditions stipulated by the GMP. The batches of APIs produced are analyzed and released by quality contro l and quality assurance for clinical or commercial use. Commercial phase The major steps in the comme rcial phase are as follows: Supply of APIs to the Group's customers. Regulatory assistance in order to answer the ques tions of health authorities on the commercial registration applications and notify the authoriti es of any change and/or improvement in the process or analytic methods or a change in the s ite originally registered in the dossier operated 85 after the API is marketed (see Section 6.5.1(c) \" Associated services offered by the Group \" of the Prospectus). Quality assistance to ensure con tinuous compliance with GMPs in the manufacture of the API and guarantee the success of the inspections c onducted by the health authorities at the sites where the API is manufactured (see Section 6.5.1(c) \" Associated services offered by the Group \" of the Prospectus). Technical and commercial support (see Section 6.5.1(c) \" Associated services offered by the Group \" of the Prospectus). Improvement of the manufacturing process in or der to lower industrial costs, improve the quality and safety of the operators a nd/or reduce the environmental impact. Management of the life cycle of the products in order to adapt to changing needs for APIs (volumes), market prices, the availability of raw materials and regulatory and environmental quality requirements. The commercial phase may take approximately eight to ten years. During the commercial phase, industrial scale producti on is performed by qualif ied operators and is done in restricted industrial areas under the conditio ns set out by GMP. The batches of APIs produced are analyzed and related by quality control and qua lity assurance for commercial use. The supply chain sends the quantities of the APIs ordered by the custom er pursuant to the production contract. The process development department ma y be involved in improving the manufacturing processes. (c) Associated services offered by the Group In the context of its API Solutions business and CD MO activities, the Group offers its customers a range of high value-added services to meet their commerc ial and regulatory needs. These services include: (i) regulatory assistance, (ii) quality assistance and (iii) technical and commercial support. Regulatory assistance As part of its comprehensive service offering, the Group offers regulatory assistance to its customers. The regulatory heritage of the Sanofi group means th at the Group benefits from solid expertise in the regulations governing each of the families of APIs sold. The regulatory assistance offered by the Group includes the preparation of all the regulatory documentation required throughout th e development cycle of the APIs, in the context of its CDMO activities in particular: (i) briefing packages; (ii) registration application packages or the chemical portion of the applicable marketing authorizations; and (iii) the permanent files of the API (ASMF - Active Substance Master File) in the European Unio n or the DMF (Drug Master File) in the United States, or the CEP (Certificates of Suitability to the European Pharmacopeia) (see Section 10.1 \" Sector regulations \" of the Prospectus). Moreover, the Group's experts responsible for regul atory assistance can assist the Group's customers with questions or information requests from the health authorities and participate in meetings with the Group's customers and competent authorities to suppor t the customer in obtaining regulatory approval. The Group also offers its customers regulatory assi stance for its products in the commercial phase. 86 Quality assistance Quality assistance is provided by the quality assurance, quality control and analytic development units of the Group.

Technical and commercial support In the pre-clinical phase or clinical development phases in particular, the Group provides its customers with technical support to assist the process to devel op APIs along with a technical analysis and expert assessment to support the preparati on of the regulatory package. 6.5.2 Group products The Group's portfolio of products comprises 11 fami lies of APIs divided into four categories:47 Complex chemical synthesis molecules incl uding alkaloids, sartans and steroids,48 molecules antihistamines and antipyretics. Biochemistry molecules derived from fermenta anti-infectives, vitamin B12 and its salt derivatives. HP-APIs including the prostaglandins. Large molecules including peptides and oligonucleotides. (a) Complex chemical synthesis molecules Complex chemical synthesis molecules are organic compounds with low to medium molecular weight. They are generally obtained through a chemical route. They are characterized by a small to medium size allowing them to cross cellular membranes to reach intracellular targets and an increasingly complex and technologically sophisticated structure. Most of the complex chemical s ynthesis molecules can be administered orally, injected or inhaled. The production cost of these molecules varies. For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales of complex chemical synthesis molecules represented 68.7% of the Group's consolidated revenue. The Gro up estimates that the potential revenue growth from sales of these molecules is high. 47 Sources : Company information; interviews with expert s in the API market co nducted in early 2021. 48 Steroids are also partly biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation to the extent that most synthetic pathways include non-chemical synthesis steps. 87 Families of APIs Group portfolio Group production sites Number of customers Examples of therapeutic use Number of ingredients Examples of ingredients marketed by the Group Steroids 35 Prednisolone, certain diseases (asthma eczema) Alkaloids (non- magnesium Frankfurt 10-50 Pain and acute inflammation Other complex synthesis molecules Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and lupus Due to the heritage and expertise from its site in Vertolaye, France, the Group is the world leader and the only European supplier totally integrated verti cally in the market for the APIs from the following families of key corticosteroids: Prednisolone, Methylprednisolone, Dexa methasone, Hydrocortisone and Spironolactone.49 The Group is the world leader in the API market for the following ke y alkaloids: Codeine and Morphine (opiates), Noscapine and Naltrexone (opioids), and leader in the market of Apomorphine and Naloxone (opioids). Primarily through Francopia, a subsidiary of the Company, the Group sells alkaloids used both in the composition (i) of narcotic opiate products and (ii) in non-narcotic opioids primarily used to fight opiate addictions (such as Naloxone Access Laws), which represented 55.5% and 44.5% of the Group's alkaloid sales for the year e nded December 31, 2021. During the same year, the principal destination countries for sales of the Group' s alkaloids (excluding sales to Sanofi) were France (25.7%), Japan (15.0%), the United States (7.0%) and Canada (6.3%), while sales to Sanofi represented 27.5% of the Group's total alkaloid sales (primarily in France, India, Colombia and Germany). It should be noted that the Group has no exposure to narcotic opiates in the United States and sells only non- narcotic opioids in the country. (b) Biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation Biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation vary in size, and have a co mplex and differentiated structure, with an average production cost. They are administered orally or can be injected. The Group's portfolio of biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation comprises APIs of the family of anti- infectives and the family of vitamin B12 and its sal t derivatives. The production of anti-infectives and 49 Source : Company's estimates on the basis of market studies conducted by third parties based on the data in public databases (Capital IQ and Orbis), IQVIA statistic s listing revenue per API, and interviews with market experts conducted in 2021. 88 vitamin B12 uses sophisticated and complex fermentati on techniques. On the date of the Prospectus, the Group ranks third in the world market and is the onl y Western producer of vitamin B12 and its solid salt derivatives. For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales of biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation represented 17.0% of the Group's consolidated reve nue. The Group considers that the potential revenue growth from sales of these molecules is substantial.

Peptides and oligonucleotides are molecules of average size, most of which can be injected, with a fairly complex structure. The production cost is high since these molecules are obtained through chemi cal synthesis, most often following a solid phase, which requires investments in specialized equipment and significant expertise in handling and analyzing such molecules. They co mbine the characteristics of the co mplex chemical synthesis molecules 50 Source : Company's estimates on the basis of market studies conducted by third parties based on the data in public databases (Capital IQ and Orbis), IQVIA statistic s listing revenue per API, and interviews with market experts conducted in 2021. 89 (including the possibility of crossing cell membranes) and those of biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation (strong selectivity and reduction of side effects). For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales of large molecules represented 2.4% of the Group's consolidated revenue.

(a) Research and Development The Research and Development (R&D) teams of th e Group include around 330 experienced process developers distributed over the Group's six production sites (see Section 6.5.3(b) \" Production \" of the Prospectus); approximately 90 people are dedicat ed to the CDMO activities and 45% are PhDs or engineers. The Group's goal is to raise the number of employees on its R&D team to about 575 in 2025, including a number of employees in the developmen t teams dedicated to the CDMO activities greater than 250. The Group's R&D capacities are primarily or ganized around two centers located at the sites in Ujpest, Hungary, and Frankfurt, Germany. The R& D programs are developed at the Group's sites in close collaboration with the supply, quality and marketing teams. The Ujpest center, with around 150 employees (with a target of around 215 peop le by 2025 in order to develop the CDMO activities, in particular in co mplex chemical synthesis molecules, HP-APIs and lipids), houses chemical development laboratori es and production facilities at pilot scale under the conditions stipulated by the GMP. In particular, it specializes in the production of complex chemical synthesis molecules and prostaglandins, due to a dedicated innovation center that supports the growth strategy for prostaglandins (see Section 6.4.1 \" Stimulate the revenue growth of the API Solutions business\" of the Prospectus). The R&D capacities at Ujp est are used in the service of local production and, to a lesser extent, the Vertolaye site. Th e center also specializes in CDMO activities, from development in the pre-clinical phase to regulatory registration and commercial supply. The Frankfurt center, with around 105 employees (with a target of around 245 persons by 2025 in order to fully optimize the existing peptides and oligo nucleotides production capacity), specializes in CDMO, the production of peptides and oligonucleotides, conjuga ted molecules and organic synthesis. It benefits from significant engineering capacities and a technological platform. The Frankfurt site also specializes in the search for the most adap ted process for manufacturing a molecule (route scouting). The R&D capacities at Frankfurt serve local production and, to a lesser extent, production at the Brindisi site. Finally, the other 80 R&D employees of the Group (w ith a target of around 110 people by 2025) are divided among the sites at Brindisi, Saint-Aubin-l \u00e8s-Elbeuf and Haverhill, which specializes in spray drying, as part of the Group's CDMO activities, a nd Vertolaye, which houses an expert micronization center. The Group considers that these capabilities enable its R&D teams to master key elements for its customers, including: 90 The R&D missions necessary fo r the Group's CDMO activities; Improvement of the Group 's production processes; Production of the APIs sold by the Group; and The support of experts. (b) Production The Group relies on a set of six production sites a nd development centers, all located in Europe. These sites are industrial sites (chemical and/or pharmaceutical) operated for many years, including five hazardous facilities classified as \"SEVESO\" (as defined by the SEVESO directive), three of which are classified as \"high threshold\" SEVESO in Vertol aye, Frankfurt and Ujpest, classified as \"low-threshold\" SEVESO in Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-El beuf and Brindisi (see Sections 3.2.1 \" Risks related to the operation of industrial sites \", 3.5.2 \" Risks related to environmental and safety regulations and environmental liabilities \" and 10.3 \" Environmental regulations \" of the Prospectus). Vertolaye (France) The operations at the Group's site in Vertolaye, where the Group employed approximately 710 people as of December 31, 2021, are primarily directed to ward the production of hormones, corticosteroids and anti-infectives, and are based on the necessary tec hnologies for conducting complex organic syntheses, custom synthesis and low-temperature reactions (up to -70\u00b0C), micronization, injectable drug production and high-pressure chromatography. The Group operat es 108 reactors at the site representing a total volume of 567 m3. During the year ended December 31, 2021, production covered 65 APIs, including Hydrocortisone, Trenbol one and Dexamethasone. Frankfurt (Germany) Operations at the Frankfurt site, where the Group had approximately 730 employees as of December 31, 2021, are primarily focused on multi-functional chemistr y, the production of antipyretics, antihistamines and peptides and oligonucleotides and are based on the technologies necessary for conducting solid phase chemistry, large volume organic synthesis, cu stom synthesis and low-temperature reactions (up 91 to -70\u00b0C), injectable drug production, lyophili zation and high-pressure hydrogenation. The Group operates 165 fine chemistry reactors representing a total volume of around 865 m3. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 27 APIs were manufactured, including Lixisenatide, Ramipril, Metamizol and Fexofenadine. Ujpest (Hungary) Operations at the site in Ujp est, where the Group employed approximately 900 people as of December 31, 2021, are essentially geared to the production of HP-APIs (including the prostaglandins), sartans and multi-functional chemistry, and are based on th e technologies required to perform complex organic syntheses and produce injectable drugs. The Group oper ates 186 reactors at the site representing a total volume of 448m 3. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 58 APIs were produced, including Irbesartan, Olmesartan, Berapr ost Sodium and Latanoprost. Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf (France) Operations at the site in Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbe uf, where the Group had approximately 300 employees as of December 31, 2021, are primarily focused on th e production of vitamin B12 and are based on large- scale fermentation and the technology required to produce injectable drugs. The Group operates 48 reactors at the site representing a total volume of 3,553m3. During the year ended December 31, 2021, five APIs were manufactured, in cluding vitamin B12 and Pristinamycin. Brindisi (Italy) Operations at the Brindisi site where the Group had approximately 230 employees at December 31, 2021, are essentially focused on the production of an ti-infectives and are based on the technologies required to perform large-scale fermentation, handl e highly active products and produce injectable drugs. The Group operates 62 reactors at the site representing a total volume of 2,583m3. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 12 APIs were ma nufactured, including Rifaximin, Rifampicin and Teicoplanin. A strategic plan to refocus the industr ial operations at the Brindisi site, approved on December 17, 2021, provides for an increase in the production of vitamin B12 derivatives, the implementation of a program for anti-tuberculars a nd the creation of a specific unit to capture CDMO projects in the initial phase. This plan led to the im pairment of certain specific industrial assets that no longer meet the strategic directions taken by the Gr oup. In addition, a social plan based on voluntary departures was announced in January 2022. Haverhill (United Kingdom) Operations at the Haverhill site, where the Group employed approximately 245 people as of December 31, 2021, are primarily focused on hyperphosphat emia, spray drying and flow chemistry and on secondary drug packaging activities. The Group operates seven reactors at the site representing a total volume of 22 m 3. During the year ended December 31, 2021, a few APIs were manufactured, including Sevelamer. Finally, due to their age and/or their original location or use, some Group sites or neighboring sites present historical contamination of the soils a nd/or of underground water (see Section 3.5.2 \" Risks related to environmental and safety re gulations and environmental liabilities \" of the Prospectus). To that end, provisions were recognized by the Group to cover environmental risks. The amount of provisions for environmental risks at December 31, 2021, is shown in Note D.10 of the consolidated financial statements in Chapter 19 \" Financial Information \" of the Prospectus. At December 31, 2021, \u20ac47.8 million was provisioned by the Group to addr ess environmental risks, and approximately \u20ac29.2 million to address potential rest oration costs for leased buildings. 92 (c) Product quality The Group considers that quality represents an essen tial part of each step in the development and manufacture of its products and services. To achie ve this, the Group implements its quality policy throughout the life cycle of the APIs: development, manufacture, distribution and marketing. It ensures the application of quality standards harmonized wo rldwide in order to comply with regulatory requirements and make a commitment to provide safe and effective products to its customers. Quality managers are appointed at each site and in each sales team of the Group to deploy, manage and control the implementation of the principles of the company's quality management system in order to ensure the quality of its products and guarant ee compliance with the regulations in force. The quality management system is flexibly designed to include the standards specific to each family of products in the Group's portfolio. In accordance with the principles of risk management and ongoing improvement, this quality management system is constantly adapted in order to anticipate regulatory changes and best meet the company's strategic goa ls for innovation, simplification and refocusing. The quality management system is totally aligned with the requirements described in the ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System guide published by the International Council on Harmonization (ICH). It integrates all the rules of good practices (G CP, GDP, GLP, GMP, GPVP) and other regulatory requirements for human health. The quality policy is the cornerstone of the Gr oup's commitment to regulatory compliance and its customers. With the company, they are the vect ors to guarantee full deployment of the Group's quality management principles and forms an important part of the vision of its quality culture. (d) Marketing In its API Solutions business, sales coverage of th e Group's customers on all continents is based on an organization established in five regions: (i) Northern Europe, (ii) Southern and Eastern Europe, (iii) Japan, (iv) North America and (v) an intercontinenta l region (ITC) consisting of Latin America, China, Russia, India and the Pacific region. The Group's sal es teams have 40 employ ees who cover the zones and/or countries (placed under the management of th e five regions) in which the Group has important interactions with its customers: Europe, North Am erica, Japan, China, India, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Russia, Africa and the Middle East. The Group's sales teams also include key account ma nagers in order to maximize the Group's key partnerships and ensure lasting relationships with its principal customers. The Sanofi account is therefore monitored within the sales department re sponsible for the API Solutions business by a key account manager and a dedicated team. In the United States, Japan and China, the Group relies on a local subsidiary in order to market, distribute and sell its products and services in these countries. The North America region is managed by the Group's subsidiary located in the United States, while the subsidiary in China re ports to the ITC region. The Group has also established a branch in Slovakia and a sales office in Russia to market the products of its API Solutions business in Central Europe and Russia. Within the CDMO activities, the Group's sales organization is established in three regions known as \"regulated zones\" where the CDMO activity offeri ng is promoted: (i) Europe and the United Kingdom, (ii) North America (United States and Canada) and ( iii) Japan and Asia-Pacific. The Group's sales team that covers these three regions has 15 employees; it is composed of business getters who watch the market and competitors and prospect the companies in which an interest in the Group's CDMO activities has been detected. The business is then monitored by business developers who also ensure sales follow- up for the customer throughout the collaboration. Special sales tracking is set up for large-scale, 93 important collaborations with a customer of the Gr oup through a member of the sales team dedicated to this customer. 6.6 Major events in the growth of the Company's business The Group, which was formed following the Prio r Reorganization Transactions (see Section 7.1 \"Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus), is a carve-out of the Sanofi group, a global pharmaceutical company resulting from numerous mergers and acquisition, particularly the merger of Sanofi and Synth\u00e9labo in 1999, the acq uisition of Aventis (from the merger of Hoechst and the Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Rorer group) in 2004 and the acquisition of Genzyme in 2011.

The Group holds a portfolio of 27 patent famili es, containing approximate ly 400 patents and 100 pending applications filed by the Sanofi group in France and abroad, which were transferred to the Group in the context of the Prior Reorga nization Transactions (see Section 7.1 \" Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus). These patents a nd pending applications mainly cover processes to manufacture APIs, particularly for the pr oduction of prostaglandins and steroids. The Group also holds a very significant know-how, including bu siness secrets, developed within the Sanofi group and transferred to the Group, concerning the produc tion of APIs, their intermediates and analytic methods. The Group, which primarily conducts activities to develop and manufacture APIs for its customers, considers that the patents and patent applications transferred are not essential to the pursuit of its economic activities. Even in the even t of the expiration or loss of its patents, the Group will be able to continue to draw a competitive advantage from its in dustrial capacities, its expertise and knowledge in the development and production of APIs and intermediates from synthesis. 6.8 Investments 6.8.1 Main investments made during the past three financial years The Group makes recurring investments, primarily in the maintenance and improvement of its production sites, in order to continually ensure comp liance with applicable regulatory and environmental standards, in accordance with the Group's ESG ob jectives. In order to increase its capacities for production and development of APIs, the Group also makes investments in performance and growth, such as improvements to its production tool. 95 The total amount of the investments made by th e Group for the year ended December 31, 2021, was \u20ac88.6 million, compared with \u20ac88.4 million for th e year ended December 31, 2020, and \u20ac81.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These inv estments represent maintenance and compliance investments and performance and growth investments. Purchases of property, plant and equipment amount ed to \u20ac111.6 million in financial year 2021, compared to \u20ac93.0 million in financial year 2020. Th e table below shows the breakdown of acquisitions of property, plant and equipment over the past three years: As a percentage Year ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Maintenance and compliance investments 70% 69% 64% Performance and France 47% 48% 42% Maintenance and compliance investments primarily re present investments to maintain or improve the flexibility of the Group's industrial tool, comply with th e regulations in force, improve the quality of its products or even to reduce its operating costs: Maintenance investments: these correspond to the investments necessary for the continuity of the activity at the Group's production sites (renewal of equipment parts, replacement of reactors and production equipment, such as tanks); and Compliance investments: these are the investment s necessary to comply with changes in the regulatory framework of the Group activities. Th ese include investments made to comply with applicable quality and HSE standards (air emissi ons or quality of the water discharged and of the soils or exposure to chemical products), such as the construction of a purification site or the compliance of equipment under pressure. Performance and growth investment s correspond to acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that significantly increase the Group' s production or development capacities, primarily as part of the development of its services as a Contract Development and Manufacturing Company (CDMO): Performance investments: these are investment s intended to increase productivity, primarily through an increase in yield or speed or the reduction of operating costs by reducing the energy or raw materials consumed (improvement in machines, expansion of the largest reactors, automation operations, organization of work); Growth investments: these correspond to the inst allation of capacities that complement existing industrial facilities and the installation of new buildings. Some of the Group's growth investments may be co -financed by its customers as part of its CDMO activities, increasing the amounts invested by the Group, in the form of payments prior to investments realization or of increased payments on the price of the products during the commercial relationship. Furthermore, certain investments may be subsidi zed via grants, which are deducted from the amounts invested. 96 6.8.2 Main investments in progress During the year ending December 31, 2022, the Group intends to pursue its policy to invest in the development of its CDMO activities, which constitutes one of the Group's pillars for organic growth, and to make performance and growth investments (s ome of which must still be submitted for approval by the Board of Directors of the Company as of its transformation into a French public limited company (soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme )), including: the design and construction of a new production workshop dedicated to the production of HP-APIs hormones at the Vertolay e site; the construction of a new R&D building at the Ujpest site; the expansion of capacities for produc tion of peptides and oligonucleotides in Frankfurt; the expansion of the laboratories at the Ujpest and Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf sites; and expansion of the existing spray-drying capacities of the Haverhill site (see Section 6.8.3 \" Main future investments \" of the Prospectus). 6.8.3 Main future investments In the future, the Group intends to continue the investment policy described above by increasing the proportion of performance and growth investments in the total share of its investments. Over the period from 2022 to 2025, the Group also plans to invest around \u20ac510 million, including around \u20ac230 million on the Group's sites in France, wh ich represents both maintenance and compliance investments and performance and growth investme nts (some of which must still be submitted for approval by the Board of Directors of the Company as of its transformation into a French public limited company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme )), divided as follows: maintenance and compliance investments: reduction in emissions of vola tile organic compounds (VOCs); bringing pressurized containers into compliance; asbestos removal; soil decontamination; replacement of certain production equipment; maintenance and compliance of the wastewater purification station and the clean water and wastewater pipes; reduction of noise and odors and gaseous emissions; improvement in the production from utiliti es (maintenance of the biomass boiler); and compliance work to comply with the rules on exposure to chemical products. performance and growth investments: design and construction of a new production work shop dedicated to the production of HP-APIs hormones at the Vertolaye site for expenditure commitments of approximately \u20ac50 million, with a startup goal of 2025; construction of a new building at the Ujpest sit es and progressive new hirings in order to boost production capacities and the reve nue generated from the Group's sales of prostaglandins to keep pace with changes in the portfolio and volumes ordered for expenditure commitments of approximately \u20ac26 million; 97 construction of new chromatography facilities at th e Frankfurt site with the goal of increasing the Group's downstream process capacity in or der to boost production of peptides and oligonucleotides for expenditure commitm ents of approximately \u20ac14 million; implementation at the Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf s ite of a new vitamin B12 fermentation process in order to increase the Group's production capac ity and reduce its industrial and environmental footprint for expenditure commitmen ts of approximately \u20ac19 million; the adaptation and transformation of the existi ng spray drying capacities at Haverhill, as well as the construction of new capacities, in order to offer a range line of capacities and expertise in this technology for expenditure commitmen ts of approximately \u20ac6.5 million; and construction of purification capacities at the biofermentation pilot scale at the Brindisi site for expenditure commitments of approximately \u20ac9 million. The Group's future investments and projects to de velop its production capacities are described in Section 6.3.3 \" Manufacturing excellence and innovation platform \" of the Prospectus. Within the framework of the French government's France Relance program, the Group obtained financial support in the amount of \u20ac10.4 million, the first payment for 20% of the total amount was made in January 2022, for a project to build a 15 MW biomass boiler at its Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf site, representing a total investment of approximately \u20ac21 million. This boiler will increase the site's production capacities, including for vitamin B12, while significantly reducing its CO 2 emissions. 6.8.4 Environmental factors that could influence th e use of the property, plant and equipment Information about the environmental aspects that coul d influence the use of the Group's property, plant and equipment is provided in Section 6.9 \" ESG policy \" of the Prospectus. 6.9 ESG Policy The Group places its extra-financial performance at the center of its development strategy and its corporate culture. Building on its experience in the Sanofi group legacy, the Group has developed a clean ESG strategy specific to its core business and its geographic footprint. As part of its work to further organize its ESG strategy, the Group conducted a survey, through which it collected over 1,200 responses from different internal and external stakeholders: customers, suppliers, employees and subcontractors, scientific partners, fina ncial partners and influential members of civil society (non-governmental organizations (NGOs), public institutions, journalists and others). The Group used the results of this survey to establish a materiality matrix , which it supplemented with a comparative study of the ESG strategies of its peers an d competitors and with the analysis of its strategic risk mapping. It then defined a strategic ambition a nd structured its programs to implement this around the following three commitments: (i) create sustainable working conditions and methods to allow commercial and operational excellence; (ii) collaborate with the Group's stakeholders in order to respect compliant and equitable practices; and (iii) offer innovatively and sustainably designed processes and services. These three commitment vectors cover key i ssues expressed by stakeholders, particularly with respect to medical needs, resiliency of the supply ch ain, environmental consider ations and the circular economy, and will contribute to the five sustai nable development objectives established by the United Nations and identified by the Group. The programs that will arise from the Group's ESG st rategy will be based both on actions already in place in the Sanofi group, which will be adapted to the scope of the Group activities, and on new actions that are currently being developed by a dedicated wo rking group. As of the admission of the Company's shares to trading on the regulated market of Eur onext Paris, the Company will create an ESG committee within its Board of Directors (see Section 15.3.3 \" ESG Committee \" of the Prospectus). 98 In assessing its non-financial performance, the Group m onitors certain performance indicators that are compiled and analyzed using a reporting protocol adap ted from the reporting system that already exists within the Sanofi group. As of the year ending December 31, 2022, and subj ect to the admission to trading of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, the management report of the Company's Board of Directors to the shareholders' meeting will contain a declaration of extra-financial performance, which will be reviewed by an independent third-party or ganization, and which will present information on the manner in which the Company takes into considerat ion the social and enviro nmental consequences of its business and on its social commitments to sustai nable development, the fight against discrimination and the promotion of inclusion, in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-102-1 and L. 22- 10-36 of the French Commercial Code. The first resu lts of these programs will be announced starting in 2023. The main risks related to the Company's activit y, which the Group will be required to describe in its declaration of extra-financial performance pursuan t to Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), are described in Chapter 3 \" Risk factors relating to the issuer \" of the Prospectus, in particular Sections 3.2.1 \" Risks related to the operation of industrial sites \", 3.2.8 \" Risks related to social dialog \", 3.2.10 \" Risks related to the Company's dependence on its key personnel and qualified employees \", 3.5.1 \" Risks related to product liability \" and 3.5.2 \" Risks related to environmental and safety regulations and environmental liabilities \". In preparing the aforementioned declaration of extra-financial performance, the Company will re view all the Group's social and environmental indicators. Subject to the admission to trading of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, the Company's annual financial report, which will be published from the year ended December 31, 2022, will include certain key climate-re lated performance indicators pursuant to the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Union and the Counc il of June 18, 2020 (Taxonomy Regulation). The Company will publish these key performance indicators ever y year and will make its best efforts so that the information published is pertin ent and consistent with the period and the scope of the Group. 6.9.1 The Group's environmental goals As a responsible actor, the Group intends to apply a policy aimed at limiting the direct and indirect impacts of its operations on the environment. The reduction of the Group's environmental footprint and its climate action are part of EUROAPI's respons ible industrial commitment. The Group will thus change its industrial practices with the goal of re ducing its emissions, optimiz ing its energy consumption and promoting the circular economy. To achieve this goal, the Group's am bition is for all of its sites to obtain ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 (best environmen tal and energy practices) no later than 2023, according to the following calendar: ISO 14001: Environmental Management ISO 50001: Energy Management Systems Vertolaye (France) 2000 No later than 2023 Frankfurt (Germany) 1999 2012 Ujpest (Hungary) 2006 2016 Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf (France) No later than 2023 2017 Brindisi (Italy) 1999 No later than 2023 Haverhill (United Kingdom) No later than 2023 No later than 2023 99 Certain programs already in place in the Sanofi gr oup will be maintained, such as the programs to outsource the production of renewable energies, limit water consumption, lim it waste production, and reuse solvents. In assessing its environmental program, the Group monitors the following indicators: greenhouse gas emissions (direct and indirect greenhouse gas emission s associated with the Group's scope 1 and scope 2 activities and the indirect emissions associated with the Group's scope 3 value chain), gas, electricity and water consumption, and the processing of hazar dous and non-hazardous waste. In addition, the Group's sites in Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf and Br indisi are subject to carbon quotas. The Group has adopted certain main objectives for 2025 or 2030. (a) The fight against climate change The Group considers that corporate mobilization is cruc ial in the face of the climate emergency and that it is its responsibility and in the interest of everyone to act quickly. As a result, it is establishing a policy aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement in order to reduce its carbon footprint, and it has set a new strategic environmental goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its activity. Direct and indirect emissions associated with the Group activities (scopes 1 and 2) The Group's ambition is to reduce its carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions related to its operations, including its industrial sites (scopes 1 and 2) by 30% by 2030 (c ompared with the level of scopes 1 and 2 emissions of 101,300 tons in 2020). Other indirect emissions related to the Group's value chain (scope 3) The Group's goal is to reach carbon neutrality ( scopes 1, 2 and 3 ) by 2050. The inclusion of the scope 3 emissions allows an assessment of the order of magnitude of the CO 2 equivalent ( CO 2e) emissions generated by the company over its entire value chain. The calculation is based on a large number of datapoints, which genera tes a high level of uncertainty. The Group works to improve the quality of this data from year to year . The scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in accordance with the definition in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol ( GHG Protocol ) of certain relevant and significant items. The group also started a project to build a 15 MW biom ass boiler at its Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf site. The new boiler will reduce CO 2 emissions from the current gas boile r by almost 76%, thereby cutting fossil- fuel CO 2 emissions by 19,581 metric tons. This project is a key component of the Group's ESG roadmap and more particularly of its i ndustrial process decarbonization program. Extreme climate events due to climate change may present a risk to both the Group's production facilities and to the supply chain that distributes the Gro up's products to its customers. In order to protect itself from these risks, the Group aims for the best engineering practices and relies on recognized standards for the completion of its facilities, taking maximum stresses into consideration for sizing the structures. In addition, technical experts from the Group's insurers issue recommendations during their inspections intended to take extreme weather conditio ns into consideration, such as the implementation of a safeguard plan if there is a risk of flooding. Na tural risks are taken into consideration in the Group's crisis management plan at all levels of the production facilities and supply chains. (b) Water management Water is a key element in the Group's industrial activity and is vital to the correct operation of the sites and an integral part of the production of APIs. The Group makes every effort to manage this resource responsibly by implementing water management plans at its sites. Special attention is paid to the sites identified as priority sites with respect to water-relate d risks, particularly the situation in a water stress 100area. As of the date of the Prospectus, the Group site s considered priorities are those in Brindisi, Italy, and Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf, France. The water used for production needs and thermal usag e (heating or cooling of processes without contact with production) essentially comes from extractions ma de directly by the Gr oup from underground or surface water masses. Specific operational actions ai med at managing water uses correctly and reducing water consumption (careful use and recycling) are bei ng pursued. For example, the project to save water draw-off set up at the Group's site in Vertolaye in 2008 to cool equipment, which reduced water consumption by 35% between 2018 an d 2020, will be maintained. (c) Improvement in the Group's energy efficiency and use of renewable energies The Group operates industrial sites for chemical and pharmaceutical production that require large volumes of electricity and natural gas for operation. In order to take into cons ideration the constraints related to the depletion of fossil resources and climate change, the Group has adopted an energy efficiency approach (consume less and better), but also the decarbonization of the energy sources used (consume differently). Standards are established that integrate energy effici ency in the design and choice of energy consuming equipment. The Group intends to apply a low-carbon energy policy by promoting the use of lower carbon energy sources in its projects and intends to reach 100% of its electricity consumed from certified renewable resources in 2025 (versus 29% in 2020 and 85% in 2021). (d) Commitment to a circular economy Management of raw materials and regeneration of solvents The Group wants to contribute to an optimized consumption of the non-renewable raw materials used in its manufacturing processes, with the goal of saving on raw materials through actions to control its processes and through the development of best operating practices. To achieve this goal, the Group uses the recovery an d recycling streams set up by its suppliers and is working to transform certain sub-products (such as solvents, iodine and lithium), which would be industrial waste without this transformation, into pr oducts that can be used by other business sectors. For example, during the production of Sevelamer Car bonate at the Haverhill site, solvents are being replaced with water in order to reduce energy consum ption and use of solvents. In addition, in the production of the Sevelamer Chlorhydrate, the solvents are recovered and reused in the manufacturing process, thus reducing the environmental footprint. In addition, in order to optimize its consumption of raw materials or that of its customers, the Group develops, alone or in partnership w ith its suppliers, actions such as th e recycling of the reaction solvents used in the process to synthesize the APIs. Waste management The Group's waste management policy is based, above all, on the reduction of waste generation at the source and then on systematic reuse and recycling be fore considering any other solution. Waste must be subject to a control audit before being du mped, which remains the last solution. Particular attention is paid to the management of waste products at the Group's sites in order to characterize them on the basis of the processes; collect , sort and store the waste; and transport and treat waste products as a function of their characteristics. 101(e) Management of discharges into the air, water, soil and subsoil The Group works to protect biodiversity and preserve fauna, flora and all species through the reduction of discharges into the air, water, soil and subsoil from each of its sites. An environmental analysis of the Group's sites is conducted periodically in order to id entify their impacts on the environment and all the species concerned, define the priorities of their acti on plans to protect the environment and measure the progress made. At its Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf site, the Group ha s also launched project ELLA to improve the manufacturing process for vitamin B12, aiming to im prove yields and reduce production costs. This project is expected to improve the quality of the w aste released into the Sein e from the Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s- Elbeuf site. The process to synthesize APIs requires the use of so lvents. The solvents used by the Group are either purchased (quantities consumed) or regenerated on s ite. The Group uses solven ts in compliance with the recommendations for correct use established throughout the Group and promotes the optimization of processes, regeneration when possible and ther mal recovery, in order to reduce the quantities consumed. The Group's aim is to reduce its emissi ons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) resulting from the synthesis of APIs. This process is built on an integrated approach at every stage in the development of products, from research to production, which is designed to: prevent the use of solvents by substituting biological processes for chemical processes; promote recycling of solvents; choose less toxic solvents; reduce emissions at the source through specifi c adaptation of the manufacturing processes and implement maximum confinem ent of solvent use; and capture and treat emissions of residual VOCs at specific treatment facilities that comply with the best techniques available on the basis of the physical-chemical characteristics of the VOCs emitted (cryogenics, gas washers, thermal oxidizers, capture on coal). At the Vertolaye site, for example, several proj ects set up in 2008 will be maintained: these projects involve the reduction of VOC discharges into the atmosphere using an incineration system with collection at all discharge channels at the site, a nd improvement of the purification plant in order to improve the quality of the discharges and re duce the volume of effluents to be treated. The Group also works to control its wastewater di scharges by implementing diffe rent programs in order to: monitor changes in the concentration of pollutants in the natural environment; reduce the volumes discharged at the source; and set up advanced, even innovative, treatments, such as ozone treatments or active charcoal treatment at the Group's sites when this is necessary. Moreover, pursuant to its health, safety and en vironmental policy and the applicable regulatory requirements, the Group is preven tively implementing at all of its sites resources to confine and/or collect accidental discharges into the so il in order to prevent infiltration. The Group has deployed a multi-year systematic program to monitor and study the soils and subsurface waters at its sites. The detailed assessments conducted in this program can result in remediation work 102when this is necessary. The Group continually assess es the remediation work necessary and implements the appropriate rehabilitation work in collabor ation with national and local authorities. (f) Management of historical pollution sites As part of the Prior Reorganization Transactions, historically polluted sites affecting the Group's operational and non-operational sites (such as those used for potential expansions or for parking) previously operated by the Sanofi group as well as certai n third-party sites were transferred to the Group. A mechanism for environmental indemnification to th e Group that covers certain risks stipulated by the framework agreement signed by the Company and Sanofi is described in Section 18.1 \" Agreements signed by the Sanofi group and the Group for the execution of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus. The group also benefits from insu rance covering environmental liabilities prior to the date of the transfers for a period of ten years from October 1, 2021, for up to \u20ac50 million (subject to the customary exclusions for this type of insurance) (see Section 18.1 \" Agreements signed by the Sanofi group and the Group for the execution of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus). The Group provides responsible management of po lluted soils, surface and subsurface waters resulting from historical contamination of operational and non-operational sites. Th e Group's environmental responsibility is managed so as to c ontrol health impacts and risks pursu ant to the applicable regulations, and the long-term protection of the environment with financial management proportioned to the associated challenges. (g) Responsible product management The Group considers health, safety and the protection of the environment in the design of its products and over their entire life span. This approach involv es all players in the product chain, from the raw materials supplier up to the end customer. Compliance with regulations is a key element of product safety for the Group's customers, the entire value chain and stakeholders. In particular, the Group is subject to the regulation on the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labe ling of Chemicals, the European regulation on Classification, Labeling and Packaging (CLP), and the European regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemi cals (REACH), which entered into force in 2007 to ensure the safety of the manufacture and u se of chemicals in European industry. The risk related to environmental regulations and environmental liabilities is presented in Section 3.5.2 \"Risks related to environmental and safety regulations and environmental liabilities \" of the Prospectus. Environmental risks are provisioned, including for the sites currently in operation, once there is a risk of harm to integrity, human health or the environm ent resulting from the past contamination of a site, which must be remediated. The amount of the provisions is valued on the basis of costs the Group estimates it must incur over a period not exceedi ng 10 years, except in exceptional cases. The amount of provisions for environmental risks as of Decemb er 31, 2021 is presented in Note D.10 of the consolidated financial statements in Chapter 19 \" Financial information \" of the Prospectus. At December 31, 2021, \u20ac47.8 million we re provisioned by the Group to address environmental risks, and \u20ac29.2 million to address potential rest oration costs for leased buildings. 6.9.2 The Group's social and governance goals Stakeholder expectations in terms of the Group's so cial impact and governance can be grouped into the following themes. These are covered in the ESG strategy, and programs ba sed around them will be implemented in 2022. 103(a) Responding to medical needs with a resilie nt supply chain for top-quality APIs The Group offers a large portfolio of APIs, consisting largely of molecules that are integrated into long- established treatment protocols that are rec ognized as successful by the health authorities. Sales of the Group's APIs that are included in the list of essential medicines as compiled by the WHO (World Health Organization) (2019) and the ANSM (2013) represent 55% of the Group's restated revenue (see Section 6.3.5 \" Broad and diversified portfolio of APIs \" of the Prospectus). The manufacturing processes for APIs at the Group's s ites are certified as GMP compliant (see Section 6.3.4 \" Excellence in regulatory and quality performance \" of the Prospectus). The Group considers that its level of vertical inte gration equates to a good reliability of supply and guarantees good supply chain resilience. However, as a responsible player in the healthcar e industry, the Group has established several projects to respond to European relocation initiatives, in additi on to its high level of vertical integration. These projects aim to secure the supply of intermediates and mature APIs of major ther apeutic interest through process innovation in order to ensure sustaina ble production in Europe (see Section 6.3.2 \" Strong vertical integration offering grea ter autonomy and security of supply \" of the Prospectus). (b) Guaranteeing employee security, and ensuring th at diversity and inclusion are part of the Group's governance Internally, the Group decided to maintain several employee programs already in place within the Sanofi group, including an e-learning platform, a program to protect health in the workplace, and a program for diversity and inclusion. To monitor its social performance, the Group refers to the following indicators: employee turnover, employee training hours, the frequency rate of injuries and the number of accidents. In its governance, the Group uses various indicators in order to measure diversity within decision- making bodies and compensation linked to sustai nability, including: employee age and gender distribution, the number of foreign employees and em ployees with disabilities (when this is declared by the employee and possibly communicable to the empl oyer in the case of the latter). The Group will identify relevant indicators to assess compensation. (c) The Group's employee health and safety policy The Group intends to ensure a healthy and safe wo rkplace for all its employees and service providers working at its sites. To achieve this goal, EUROAP I is developing a health, safety and environmental strategy based on a management system consistent with its challenges and activities and the involvement of the entire organization. The health, safety and environmental policy is defined by the group's HSE Department (which reports to the Department of Industrial Operations), a pproved by Management and signed by the Chief Executive Officer. On the basis of the assessment of the risks of health impacts, eac h site is implementing prevention programs and rolling out hygiene practices in line with applicable regulations and the health, safety and environmental policy defined by the Group. These pr actices primarily include collective and individual confined and protection measures against exposures at all work stations where chemical substances or biological agents are handled. The Group aims to move toward zero accidents, and th erefore plans to maintain the frequency rate of accidents resulting in losttime for its employees (Lost Time Injury - LTI) at a level less than or equal to 1.5 per 1,000,000 hours worked (compared with 1. 3 per 1,000,000 hours worked at Group level in 2021 104and 8.8 per 1,000,000 hours worked for the chemical, pha rmaceutical and oil sector in France in 2019) and the rate of recordable work accidents (Total Reco rdable Injury - TRI) at a level less than or equal to 2.5 per 1,000,000 hours worked by 2025 (compare d with a TRI level of 2.4 per 1,000,000 hours worked at the Group level in 2021). (d) Diversity within decision-making bodies Within the framework of its ESG policy, the Group strives for diversity and intends to establish an inclusive workspace for its employees. Its goal is to improve the representation of diversity within its local workforce, both at the hiring stage and in the development of professional careers. The Group also intends to encourage a balanced representation of men and women at all levels of seniority and hierarchy and promote equal opportunities fo r under-represented employees. Thus, the Group's objective is to encourage divers ity and balanced representation of men and women within its expanded executive team, consisting of the executive committee and the principal executives in the Company's key positions in order to reach 30% women in these positions by 2025, compared to 23% at December 31, 2021. 1057. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 7.1 Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions In connection with the pr oposed admission to trading of the Co mpany's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, a portion of the activities of de velopment, manufacture, marketing, distribution and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) a nd intermediates of the Sanofi group was carved-out from the rest of its business activities in order to consolidate these transferred activities within EUROAPI and/or its subsidiaries (the \"Transferred Activity\"). All of these reorganization transactions were completed between March 2021 and January 2022 (the \"Prior Reorganization Transactions\"). The Prior Reorganization Transactions were conducte d in ten countries: France, Hungary, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, Slovakia, Russia, United States, Japan and China. They are detailed below and were primarily completed through various securiti es and/or assets transactions in accordance with the following principles: The companies of the Sanofi group that operate d both activities within the scope of EUROAPI and activities that do not fall within this perimeter were split. o In France, Hungary, Germany and Italy, the assets and liabilities related to the Transferred Activity were transferred to a lo cal, dedicated subsidiary newly formed by the Sanofi group; o In the United States, Japan and China, the ass ets and liabilities related to the Transferred Activity were transferred to a dedicated, lo cal subsidiary newly formed by EUROAPI; o In Slovakia and Russia, the assets and liabilities related to the Transferred Activity were transferred, respectively, to a branch and a local sales office attached to EUROAPI France (a company sold by Sanofi Chimie to the Company in the Prior Reorganization Transactions in France). After completion of these transactions to carve- out the Transferred Activity, the Sanofi group sold to the Company all the shares of the newly formed local subsidiaries held by Sanofi entities. In the United Kingdom, the local subsidiary of th e Sanofi group, whose activities fell primarily within the scope of the Group's activities, w as renamed and then sold to the Company. In France, \"Francopia\", the local subsidiary of the Sanofi group, whose activities fell exclusively within the scope of the Group's business activity, was sold to the Company. All securities sales of local subsidiaries of the Sanofi group to the Company in the context of the Prior Reorganization Transactions were executed on the basi s of the value used for the carve-out transactions executed within the Sanofi group. The acquisition pric e for the Company to acquire the securities of the local subsidiaries in question was financed by the capital increase described in Section 20.1.7 \" History of share capital over the past three years \" of the Prospectus. As of the date of the Prospectus, EUROAPI therefore controls all the Transferred Activity. Prior to Sanofi's combined annual shareholders' me eting, to be held on May 3, 2022, and called to decide on the Distribution in Kind, shares of the Company corresponding to approximately 70% of the Company's share capital that will be distributed to Sa nofi's shareholders (other than Sanofi itself and and holders of shares issued upon the exercise of Sanofi stock options since January 1, 2022) in connection with the Distribution in Kind and the Investment (see Section 17.1 \" Shareholders holding more than 5% of the capital on the date of the Prospectus \" of the Prospectus), will be purchased by Sanofi from Sanofi Aventis Participations. 1067.1.1 Prior Reorganization Transactions implemented in France, Hungary, Germany, Italy, the United States, Japan, China, Slovakia and Russia In France, Hungary, Germany, Italy, Slovakia, Russi a, the United States, Japan and China, the portion of the Transferred Activity had been operated by a non-dedicated local subsidiary of the Sanofi group (or, in the case of (i) the United States, two non-de dicated local subsidiaries, and (ii) France, two subsidiaries, one that was dedicated and the other non-dedicated). The Prior Reorganization Transactions consisted primarily of transferring a ll the assets and liabilities related to the Transferred Activity to local subsidiaries of Sanofi or the Comp any (with the exception of the Francopia company). These transfers of assets and liabilities took the fo rm of splits, sales of businesses (or the local equivalent) and/or sales of isolated assets and liabiliti es, depending on the jurisdiction in question. With a few exceptions, such as in Germany (see Section 18.2 \" Agreements signed by the Sanofi group and third parties for the execution of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus), these transfers covered all the liabilities attached to the Transferred Activity, including environmental liabilities prior to the date of the transfers. In Fr ance, Hungary, Germany and Italy, all the shares and voting rights of the local subsidiaries were then so ld by the relevant entity of the Sanofi group to the Company. In France, the Prior Reorganization Transactions consisted of selling all shares of the Francopia company to the Company. Prior to this sale, the Sanofi Chimie company transferred certain assets to Francopia, including the residual customer base and cer tain isolated assets related to the transferred APIs (including the intellectual property rights, the Drug Master Files and others) and the CEP (certificates of suitability to the European Pharmacopeia, as well as the inventories of raw materials used in the manufacture of said APIs), giving Francopia all th e assets and liabilities attach ed to the activity for alkaloids. At the same time as the transfers of assets and liabilities and the sales of securities described above, certain isolated assets and liabilities falling within the Transferred Activity, such as intellectual property rights (primarily trademarks and patents), inventories or contracts, were the object of separate sales, so that, as of the date of the Prospectus, they are who lly owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. 7.1.2 Prior Reorganization Transactions implemented in the United Kingdom Before the Prior Reorganization Transactions, the Transferred Activity was operated in the United Kingdom by Genzyme Limited, a local subsidiary of the Sanofi group. The Prior Reorganization Transactions implemented in the United Kingdom consist of renaming this subsidiary \"EUROAPI UK Limited\", then selling all th e shares of this entity to the Company. Prior to this sale, EUROAPI UK Limited acquired a patent and expertise in the manufacture of the API Sevelamer from a company of the Sanofi group. A c ontract signed with a customer of the Sanofi group was also transferred by Genzyme Corporation to EUROAPI UK Limited. The few assets (essentially inventories) held by this subsidiary and which were not dedicated to the Transf erred Activity were sold to other entities of the Sanofi group. As of the date of the Prospectus and as a result of the completion of the Prior Reorganization Transactions in the United Kingdom, the Company directly holds 100% of the capital and voting rights of EUROAPI UK Limited. 7.1.3 Agreements signed during the Prior Reorganization Transactions While the Prior Reorganization Transactions were co mpleted, the Company and its subsidiaries signed agreements on the development, manufacture, supply a nd distribution of certain APIs and the supply of services and licensing with Sanofi subsidiaries that are not subsidiaries of the Company. A detailed description of the relations between the Group and the Sanofi group as a result of the Prior Reorganization Transactions appears in Chapter 18 \" Related-party transactions \" of the Prospectus. 1077.2 Organization of the Group The simplified organizational chart below shows th e legal organization of the Group and its main subsidiaries as of the date of the Prospectus following completion of the Prior Reorganization Transactions (see Section 7.1 \" Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus). 7.3 The Company's major subsidiaries The principal direct and indirect subsidia ries of the Company are described below: EUROAPI France is a French simplified joint-stock company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions simplifi\u00e9e , (SAS)), with a share capital of \u20ac146,089,593 and registered office at 15 rue Traversi\u00e8re, 75012 Paris, France, registered under number 891 090 680 with the Paris Trade and Companies Register.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW Readers are invited to read the following information relating to the Group's results along with the Group's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as presented in Chapter 19 \" Financial information \" of the Prospectus. The Group's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, have been prepared in accordan ce with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union. The Statutory Audi tor's report on the Group's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 , 2020 and 2019, is included in Section 19.3 \" Audit of historical annual financial information \" of the Prospectus. These accounts show the historical financial performance of the EUROAP I business within the Sanofi group. The historical organization of the Group's activities deviates from the target organizational and reporting structure decided upon during the implementation of the Prior Reorganization Transactions. Consequently, in addition to the historical data and in order to provide comparable data that takes into account the impacts of the contractual and organiza tional provisions related to the implementation of EUROAPI's new business model resulting from the Prio r Reorganization Transacti ons, as if it had been implemented as of January 1, 2019, the Group is volun tarily providing restated financial information for the following indicators for the financial years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: restated revenue, restated gross profits, restated EBITDA, restated Core EBITDA and restated Core FCF Conversion. This restated information, which ta kes the form of restated alternative performance indicators, is included in Sections 8.1.4(b) \" Restated performance indicators taking into account the new EUROAPI business model resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" and 8.2.13 \"Restated alternative perform ance indicators relating to results \" of the Prospectus. The alternative performance indicat ors described in Chapters 8 \" Operating and financial review \" and 9 \"Liquidity and capital resources \" of the Prospectus, where applicable on a restated basis, may not be comparable to similarly named indicators used by other companies. Moreover, even though these indicators are presented to enable investors to better understand the Group's new business model, they are provided for illustrative purposes only and prepar ed on the basis of a number of assumptions. They are therefore not necessarily representative of what the Group's financial position and operating income (loss) would have been if it had carried on its bus iness as a separate and autonomous entity during the periods presented in the Prospectus and are not indicative of the Group's future performance. Unless otherwise indicated, the financial informat ion presented and discussed in this Chapter 8 \"Operating and financial review \" is extracted from the Group's conso lidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 8.1 Overview 8.1.1 Introduction The Group develops, manufactures, markets and di stributes active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and intermediates used in the formulation of me dicines for human and veterinary use, both from originators and generics, including all types of molecu les in the API market: small molecules (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemist ry molecules derived from fermentation and highly- potent molecules (\"HP-APIs\")) and large molecules (such as peptides and oligonucleotides). As of December 31, 2021, the Group markets its APIs to approximately 530 customers in over 80 countries. Its customer base includes the majority of the wo rld's largest pharmaceutical companies (including Sanofi, Boehringer Ingelheim and Alfasigma), ge neric drug manufacturers (Teva), animal health products manufacturers (MSD Animal Health, Ceva), consumer health and nutrition products companies (DSM), biotech companies (Mithra , SQY Therapeutics, Rancho Santa Fe and NH Theraguix), (Catalent) and distribution companies. 110The Group, which generated \u20ac892.8 m illion in revenue for the year ende d December 31, 2021, estimates that, in terms of revenue, it is the world's leadi ng manufacturer of small molecules and the world's second largest manufacturer of APIs (small molecules (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemistry molecules derived from fe rmentation and HP-APIs) and large molecules), as well as the seventh largest manufacturer in the gl obal CDMO (Contract Development & Manufacturing Organization) market in 2020. 51 Production is entirely carried out in its six industrial sites located in Europe and established in five countries (France, Germany, Hungary, Ital y and the United Kingdom). The Group offers its customers (i) a diversified portfolio of APIs from its catalog, for which the intellectual property is owned by the Group or licensed by the Group and/or is subject to a distribution agreement (the \"API Solutions\" business), and (ii) development and/or manufacturing services for APIs, as a CDMO, for which the intellectual property is owned by the Group's customers (the \"CDMO\" activities). The Group has a single-sector business of developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing APIs and intermediates used in the formulation of medicin es for human or veterinary use, whether originator or generic. A presentation of the segment informa tion used by the Group for its reporting purposes is provided in Note D.25. \" Segment information \" to the Group's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The end markets covered by the Group are diversified and divided by: - Flows to distinguish between sales made to Sa nofi and sales made to other Group customers (excluding Sanofi). - Product categories that are divided into (i) \"complex ch emical and vitamin B12; and (iii) prostaglandi ns and hormones); and (iv) \"large molecules\" including peptides and oligonucleotides. - Type to identify sales resulting from the API So lutions business and sales made as part of development and/or manufacturing projects for AP Is on behalf of a specific customer (the CDMO activities). - Target regions of sales , namely: Europe, Asia-Pacific, North America and Rest of World. The breakdown of the Group's consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, is described in Note D.25.3 \" Additional information \" of the consolidated financial statements. 8.1.2 Key factors impacting results Certain key factors, past events and transactions have had, and could continue to have, an impact on the Group's activities and results as discussed below. The risk factors relating to the Company are also described in Chapter 3 \" Risk factors relating to the issuer \" of the Prospectus. The key factors impacting the Group's results include: (a) Change in the supply and demand of APIs The demand for APIs can be affected by various causes, some of which reflect structural changes (such as the aging of the population or increasing access to h ealthcare in emerging countries), while others are 51 Source : a comparison made by the Company on the basis of data contained in the annual reports published by the main industrial players in the API sector. 111the result of more cyclical events (such as geopoliti cal or macroeconomic changes, like trade conflicts, embargoes, sudden changes in customs duties or sanitary crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic). Market growth The merchant market for process development and manufact uring of APIs is expected to grow at 6% to 7% per year from 2019 to 2024, despite an annual growth rate that fell to 2% between 2019 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Market growth in the coming years should be driven mainly by (i) increased volumes in the pharmaceutical market, (ii) a favorable product mix effect resulting from the growth of high-value drug substances (particular ly large molecules and HP-APIs) with increased demand for targeted treatments, (iii) the trend of increased outsourcing by pharmaceutical companies of part of the drug value chain, and finally (iv) an increase in prices on a like-for-like basis. The global demand for drugs is driven by improved and expanded access to care in several re gions of the world, in particular due to the growth of the middle class in developing countries. A fundamental trend for large pharmaceutical companies is to progressively outso urce part of their activities, such as conducting clinical trials or the production of APIs and/or the manufacturing of finished products to specialized companies. The autonomy from Sanofi followi ng the completion of the Prior Reorganization Transactions and its initial listing shou ld allow the Group to capture a larg er share of the market growth than before. Historically, the Group has been restri cted by the need to serve Sanofi's primary captive needs and has not benefited fully from market gr owth, estimated at around 7% per year over the 2015- 2019 period. The Group also considers that in the fu ture it will be in a better position to secure sales with customers other than Sanofi, in particular those who in the past did not wish to outsource the development and production of APIs to their direct co mpetitor. For more informa tion, readers are invited to refer to Section 6.2.2 \" Market dynamics \" of the Prospectus. Impacts related to a global health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic The demand of the Group's customers for APIs mark eted by the Group may also be impacted by a sanitary crisis or a pandemic, in particular COVI D-19. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the lack of transparency c oncerning the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmaceutical laboratories stockpiled APIs that were not completely used due the decrease in certain infectious pathologies resulting from governmental pr otective measures taken to contain the spread of the pandemic, as well as delays in certain treatment s and surgeries considered to be non-essential. These two factors led to a decrease in sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Group thus estimated that this cris is generated a revenue drop in 2021 52 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, generated from certain products53, particularly sales of Pristinamycin to Sanofi and sales of Methylprednisolone, Prednisone and Prednisolone to other customers. Moreover, the business development of some CDMO projects was delayed due to the COVID-19 crisis causing a decrease in the number of commercial offers sent to customers. However, the Group experienced strong demand for sp ecific APIs, such as (i) Dexamethasone in 2021 after the World Health Organization's (WHO) reco mmendation for severe cases of COVID-19 or (ii) Hydroxychloroquine, which generated an increase in re venue of \u20ac3.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The Group has also managed to seize commercial opport unities to produce APIs used in treatments of COVID-19, such as, for example, in 2021 in th e United Kingdom for approximately \u20ac9 million. For more information, readers are invited to refer to Sections 3.1.1 \" Risks related to the in ternational nature 52 Estimated at approximately \u20ac30.5 million on a basi s restated for the new business model of EUROAPI resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transactions. 53 Estimated on a basis restated for the new EUROAPI business mode resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transactions at approximat ely \u20ac18.5 million on sales of Pristinamycin to Sanofi, approximately \u20ac8 million on the sales of Methylprednisolone to other cu stomers, and at approximately \u20ac4 million on sales of Prednisone and Prednisolone to other customers. 112of the Group activities and to sanitary crises and to geopolitical or macroeconomic instability \" and 6.2.4 \" Impact of COVID-19 \" of the Prospectus. Impacts related to the global reach of the Group Due to its global nature, the level of Group ac tivities may vary depending on the opportunities and threats inherent to the countries or regions in which it operates. For example, restrictions on imports and exports may limit its distribution capacities or its su pply of raw materials. In contrast, the political willingness to repatriate part of the production of AP Is to Europe could, if necessary, benefit the Group's business. The EUROAPI site based in Saint-Aubin- l\u00e8s-Elbeuf, for example, obtained a \u20ac3.2 million grant from BPI France and the Normandy region in or der to increase its production capacity for vitamin B12. The Group received a \u20ac0.7 million advance in 202 1 and is expected to collect the remaining \u20ac2.5 million in 2022 and 2023. (b) Group's positioning and strategy Growth and performance of the CDMO activities and the API Solutions business The Group offers its customers a diversified API por tfolio from its catalog (API Solutions), as well as API development and/or manufacturing services as a CDMO. API Solutions' sales have generated revenue accounting for 75.1% of the Group's consol idated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 (75.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020). CDMO sales have generated 24.9% of the Group's consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 (24.2% for the ye ar ended December 31, 2020). The evolution of the Company's business and results shoul d be seen in the light of its strategy to develop its CDMO activities. The Group, which was the seve nth-largest manufacturer in the global CDMO market in 2020, considers that it has a solid foot hold in this business (industrial capacity, know-how and expertise) and significant room for growth, consider ing (i) the commercial resources allocated to this business, which were limited in the past, and (ii) the fact that it is independent from its principal shareholder Sanofi, which will allow it to work with all players in the market, which was not the case in the past. The reorientation of the API portfolio towa rd the CDMO activities, particularly toward complex molecules generating higher margins, is contribut ing to the improvement of the Group's industrial performance and results. Moreover, the Company's strategy is focused on reinfo rcing its key player status in small molecules, both by accelerating the growth of its existing API po rtfolio within its API Solutions business and also by encouraging the growing exposure of its portfolio to its CDMO activities, especially by continuing to (i) invest in technology and innovation and deve lop its production capacities; (ii) make efforts to improve the Group's operating margin and cash position; and (iii) maintain a strong environmental and societal commitment by capitalizing mainly on the strong legacy of Sanofi. For more information on the acceleration of the re orientation of the portfolio toward the CDMO activities, please refer to Section 6.4.2 \" Capitalize on innovation and development to accelerate the reorientation of the portfolio toward the CDMO activities, particularly in the peptide and oligonucleotide segment \" and to Chapter 11 \" Trends \" of the Prospectus. In the CDMO activities, the level of activity is linke d in particular to the commercial success of drugs developed by the Group's customers. This may be influenced by the success of clinical trials, authorizations given by the health authorities (the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products ( Agence Nationale de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 du M\u00e9dicament et des produits de sant\u00e9 -\"ANSM\"), the European Medicines Agency (\"EM A\"), the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), etc.) as well as by the efficiency of the drug and its coverage by public or private health insuran ce plans. For example, the Group experienced an increase in revenue in North Amer ica in 2020, linked in particular to the approval by the FDA of a product from an American biotechnol ogy company. As part of its development strategy, 113the Group strives to maintain a fairly balanced proj ect portfolio in terms of the maturity level of the various products. Group's premium positioning For API sales from the API Solutions business and for the CDMO activities, the Group differentiates itself through a strategic premium positioning reflected both by the quality of the products delivered and by the Group's reliability and operati onal excellence throughout its supply chain. In some markets, the Group charges higher prices than some of its competitors , particularly in Asia. This price difference is nevertheless reflected in the quality, compliance and re liability of produc t deliveries, but also has an impact on the Group's costs. See Section 6.3.4 \" Excellence in regulatory and quality performance \" of the Prospectus. The Group's performance depends on its ability to maintain a high level of service to its customers. (c) Changes in raw material and energy prices Raw materials and energy purchase prices depend on their availability, mark et conditions, purchase volumes, relations with suppliers and purchase terms ne gotiated with them. In rare cases, supply tensions may restrict the production of certain APIs. Many of the Group's contracts contain clauses allowing it to pass on to its customers a portion of the increases in raw material, energy and inflation cost s. The Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement entered into with the Sanofi group, as amended, includes (i) a compensation mechanism for the Group in the event of a significant increase in the price of certain key raw materials and solvents, subject to certain thresholds and time limits be ing met, and (ii) a reciprocal sharing clause between the parties of a portion of the change in energy costs related to Sanofi's purchases, relative to a reference base determined by the parties. In addition, in the current context of strong price increases, in particular for raw materials and energy, the Group intends to form alize its relationship with its suppliers through contracts rather than purchase orders, in order to be tter control the volatility of all raw materials used by the Group. The Group has also launched an in itiative (mono-sourcing exit program) aimed at guaranteeing the continuity of its supply, by striving to diversify its sources of supply . This enables the Group to limit its dependence on its suppliers, to st rengthen its negotiating power and consequently to better control its costs (See Section 6.3.2 \" Strong vertical integration offering greater autonomy and security of supply \" of the Prospectus for more details). (d) Changes in other production costs and im provements in operating efficiency The Group's results depend in particular on the optim al use of its production capacity, in order to obtain the best possible return on its industrial assets. The Group's production costs include a majority of fixed costs compared to variable costs. The average occupancy rate of its sites was 70% in 2020 and 68% in 2021, and the Group wishes to increase this rate by 2025 in order to generate an improvement in the Group's profitability. In 2020, the Group suffered a \u20ac9.8 million impairment loss on no n-commissioned industrial assets due to the discontinuation of the phospholipid manufacturi ng project in Frankfurt as a result of lowered sales volumes in the main markets of China and Russia. In addition, a significant and permanent decline in demand at the Brindisi site in 2021 led the Group to record a write-down of \u20ac8.9 million in the value of certain equipment at the Brindisi site on an exceptional basis. Some of the Group's development areas often require dedicated and specific capacities. For example, this is the case for hormones produced at the Vertol aye site, peptides and olig onucleotides produced at the Frankfurt site, prostaglandins produced at the Ujpest site, spray-drying at the Haverhill site and vitamin B12 produced at the Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf site. 114In addition, in 2020, the Group implemented measur es to improve the operational efficiency of its production sites in the areas of productivity, process improvement (reliability and transformation yield), better use of facilities, optimization of maintenan ce practices and costs, energy and waste management. In this context, the Group is notably committing to performance investments. For more information on this subject, see Section 6.8 \" Investments \" of the Prospectus. This operational efficiency program consists of approximately 100 initiatives (for more details, see Section 6.3.2 \" Strong vertical integration offering greater autonomy and security of supply \" and Chapter 11 \" Trends \" of the Prospectus) related to the production sites' industrial optimization and purchasing excellence. In addition, in 2021 the Group set up an ambitious program to optimize inventory levels over several years, covering raw materials, inte rmediates and finished products. The Group's performance is impacted by maintena nce and improvement cycles for its industrial facilities, which may lead to a temporary halt in production. For example, in 2020, a prostaglandin production workshop at the Ujpest site in Hung ary was shut down for six months to carry out maintenance operations and increase production capac ity, thus affecting the Group's results. In addition, due to the specific nature of the manufacture of the Group's APIs or the applicable regulatory requirements, their production requires the use of specific equipment and technologies, or even, in certain cases, dedicated facilities. As a result, the Group ma y experience overcapacity episodes at certain sites and underutilization of production cap acity at others. In such cases, the Group may not be able to rapidly transfer production between sites using the same technology. For example, the Brindisi site experienced underutilization in the production of anti-infectives during the third quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021, which re quired the site to be closed fo r a month. Due to the decrease in certain infectious diseases resulting from government al protection measures following the spread of COVID-19, demand for Pristinamycin has fallen shar ply and the Group therefore decided to shut down the dedicated production line at the Saint-A ubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf site for three months. Finally, the Group cannot exclude that social movements, in particular strikes, may disrupt its activity. See Section 3.2.8 \" Risks related to social dialog \" of the Prospectus for further details. For example, the Vertolaye site experienced walkouts in July 2021 in the context of the Prior Reorganization Transactions linked to the creation of the Group, which had only a mi nor effect on production at the site. On the other hand, some of the production staff at the Saint-Aubin-l \u00e8s-Elbeuf site went on strike in the last quarter of 2021, demanding payment of a transf er bonus to all EUROAPI France employees. This strike led to disruptions in the production of vitamin B12 with an estimated negative impact of approximately \u20ac2.8 million on EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021. (e) Contractual agreements with the Group's main customers The Group generates its revenue from a diversif ied customer base with 530 customers and has commercial relationships of more than 20 years on average with most of its 20 largest customers (excluding Sanofi). The contractual agreements in fo rce with customers may impact the Group's results. For example, certain APIs and/or intermediates and/or other substances necessary for the manufacture of drugs marketed by the Sanofi group or manufactured by Sanofi on behalf of its customers are currently supplied to Sanofi under a fixed-price manufacturing and supply agreement (the \"Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement\"),54 expiring five years after the Company' s initial listing, and the pricing terms of the agreement, which include a price-volume corridor, corresponding to an annual tiered compensation mechanism between the parties cove ring variations, upward or downward, beyond a threshold agreed by them, between target revenue and actual revenue related to Sanofi's purchases of a certain number of APIs. Section 18.3.1 \" Manufacturing and supply agreements for certain APIs \" of the 54 The retroactive application of the sales prices agreed upon in the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement to historical business volumes and other restatements related to the implementation of the new business model are presented and detailed in Sections 8.1.4(b) \" Restated performance indicators taking into account the new EUROAPI business model resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" and 8.2.13 \" Restated alternative performance indicators relating to results \" of the Prospectus. 115Prospectus contains a description of the volum e protection mechanisms provided by the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. For commercial relations with customers outside Sanofi, the Group's customers use purchase orders, which represented approximately 75% of the rest ated revenues of its API Solutions business as of December 31, 2021 (excluding Sanofi), and the Group has formalized a contractual relationship with its customers in other cases. In the future, the Group inte nds to further formalize the relationship with its customers through contracts rather than purchase or ders. In the context of its CDMO activities, all commercial relations between the Group and its customers are formalized by contract. (f) Investments The Group operates in a relatively capital-intensive industry that requires ongoing investment to maintain and/or increase production capacity, to upgr ade assets and technology, to improve operational performance and to comply with applicable regulations. The total amount of investments55 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was \u20ac88.6 million, \u20ac88.4 million and \u20ac81.8 million (representing 9.9%, 9. 4% and 8.9% of consolidated revenue). The Group intends to pursue a disciplined investment policy consiste nt with its development strategy. In addition, the Group operates in a restrictive legislative and regulat ory environment with respect to environmental protection, public health and safety a nd has therefore had to incur, and will have to continue to incur, costs (both in capital expenditure and operating expenses) to meet legal and regulatory requirements. Due to regulatory constraints, the build ing dedicated to hormones at the Vertolaye facility was upgraded to standards in 2020 to respond to the change in classification of hormones as an OEB 5 product,56 which resulted in a temporary halt in producti on. This shutdown had a significant impact on the Group's results in 2020. The Group regularly makes new investments to incr ease its production capacity in order to meet the growing demand for certain APIs. For example, this is the case for the production of vitamin B12, for which the Group plans to implement a new vitamin B12 fermentation process at the Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s- Elbeuf site, with the objective of increasing the Group's production capacity by between 25% and 50% by 2024. (g) Taxes and taxation Operating in several countries, the Group is subject to the regulations of different tax regimes; differences in tax rates and bases of taxation may th erefore have an effect on the Group's results. The amount of taxes payable by the Group may also vary significantly from one financial year to the next, due to changes in the tax regulations applicable in France or in the countries where the Group operates, as well as to any limitations on the alloca tion of tax losses under tax regulations. As a result of the Prior Reorganization Transacti ons, the Group's French companies will not be consolidated for tax purposes until 20 23. As a result, the amount of tax owed by the Group is expected to increase in the year ending December 31, 2022, as the Group will not be able to use the losses of the French operating company to offset the profits generated by Francopia. Under the terms of the agreements with Sanofi, co mpensation is provided fo r tax losses incurred between October 1 and December 31, 2021, that the Group could have used in the future. 55 As defined in Section 9.4.2 \" Capital expenditures \" of the Prospectus. 56 Occupational Exposure Band . 116(h) Changes in foreign exchange rates Some of the Group's assets, liabilities, revenues and e xpenses are denominated in currencies other than the euro. The main currencies for which the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk are the pound sterling, the Hungarian forint, the US dollar and the Japanese yen. A significant portion of the Group's expenses are denominated in US dollars (USD), while the majority of its sales are denominated in euros (EUR), resulting in a structural mism atch between its costs and revenues. Changes in the exchange rates of the euro agains t other currencies, including those mentioned above, result in accounting exchange differences that affect the amount of the relevant items in the Group's financial statements, although their value rema ins unchanged in their original currency. Quantitative information on exchange rate risks is provided in Section 3.4.1 \" Exchange rate risks \" of the Prospectus, and the hedging policy is described in Section 3.6.2 \" Risk coverage policy \" of the Prospectus. (i) Changes in and costs of financial debt The financing of EUROAPI's activities was mainly provided by Sanofi over the years 2021, 2020 and 2019 (see Note A.3.3. of the financial statements). In connection with this financing, the Company has benefited from the financial terms a pplicable to Sanofi subsidiaries. The short-term debt and other financial liab ilities owed to Sanofi amounted to \u20ac1.4 million, \u20ac55.8 million and \u20ac44.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Financial expenses amounted to \u20ac2.1 million, \u20ac1.9 million and \u20ac3.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Group's other financial liabilities relate to lease liabilities, which amounted to \u20ac22.7 million, \u20ac17.5 million and \u20ac20.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021, 2020 an d 2019, respectively. Details of the Group's lease liabilities are provided in Note D.9 of the Group's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. To ensure the Group's liquidity, on February 22, 20 22, the Group entered into a \u20ac451 million revolving credit facility (the \"RCF Loan Agr eement\") that is scheduled to matu re on February 26, 2027, the main features of which are presented in Chapter 9 \" Cash and shareholders' equity \" of the Prospectus. 8.1.3 Main income statement items The main income statement items, on which the Group' s management relies to analyze its consolidated results, are described below: Revenue Revenue is mainly derived from the sale of APIs , corresponding to API Solutions revenue, and from specialized industrial development and manufactur ing services contracts, corresponding to CDMO revenue. Sales of manufactured APIs for which the intell ectual property is owned by the Group or licensed by the Group and/or covered by a distribution contract (API Solutions revenue) are recognized in the income statement when the pe rformance obligations related to the contracts are met. Revenue from development and manufacturing services c ontracts, for which the intellectual property is owned by the customer (CDMO revenues), are recogn ized when the performan ce obligations identified at the inception of the contract are met. 117See Note B.11 of the financial statements for more information on revenue recognition related to the API Solutions business and the CDMO activities. Cost of sales57 Cost of sales mainly includes the direct and indir ect cost of manufacturing APIs sold, whether from the API Solutions business or the CDMO activities. The ma nufacturing cost of APIs sold includes direct costs of materials and solvents used in the ma nufacturing process, depreciation expenses corresponding to the normal use of property, plant and equipm ent and software for manufacturing purposes; and personnel and other costs directly attributable to production and operation of the sites. In addition, costs incurred by EUROAPI in the pr e-production phase of CDMO service contracts with customers are capitalized when they do not repr esent a performance obligation and are necessary for fulfillment of the contract. Those costs are then ch arged to the income statement under \"Cost of sales\" once the contract performance phase st arts, following the same pattern as for the transfer of performance obligations to the customer and fo r recognizing the associated revenue. Selling and distribution expenses Selling and distribution expenses include expenses re lated to the sales and quality control teams, the direct costs of bringing products to market and expenses incurred in developing regulatory strategies. Research and development expenses 58 Research and development expenses mainly comprise primary costs incurred by the Group's development platforms relating to in-house projects to develop new products and services or to improve existing products and services before th ey move into industrial operation. Administrative and general expenses59 Administrative and general expenses include expenses relating to central and support functions, as well as insurance and IT services. Other operating income and expenses Other operating income and expenses include realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on operating activities, as well as results of the dis posals of non-financial assets. These line items also include income and expenses that are of an operating nature but do not contri bute to generating operating income during the period. Financial expenses and income60 Financial expenses and income include the cost of de bt, interest received and paid in respect of the relationship with entities in the Sanofi group, the unwinding of discount on long-term provisions, net interest cost related to employee benefits and net interest expense on lease liabilities. 57 See Note B.12 of the financial statements for further information. 58 See Note D.15 of the financial st atements for further information. 59 See Note A.3.2 of the financial statements for further information. 60 See Note D.19 of the financial st atements for further information. 118Income taxes Income tax expense represents the sum of current income tax and deferred income tax. See Note B.17 of the financial statements for further information. 8.1.4 Main performance indicators (a) The Group's performance indicators The Group's main performance indicators are (i) reve nue broken down by flow (i.e., the breakdown of sales between Sanofi and other customers), by product category and by type; (ii) gross profit; (iii) EBITDA; (iv) Core EBITDA; and (v) Core FCF conversion (as described in Section 9.5.4 \" Core FCF conversion \" of the Prospectus). These performance indicators are regularly tracked by the Group to analyze and evaluate its businesses and their tren ds, measure their performance, prepare earnings forecasts and make strategic decisions. EBITDA, Core EBITDA and Core FCF conversion ar e alternative performance indicators within the meaning of AMF position number 2015-12. EBITDA, Core EBITDA and Core FCF conversion are not standardized accounting aggregates meeting a gene rally accepted definition under IFRS. They should not be considered as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, which are measures defined by IFRS, or a measure of liquidity. The alternative performance indicat ors described in Chapters 8 \" Operating and financial review \" and 9 \"Liquidity and capital resources \" of the Prospectus, where applicable on a restated basis, may not be comparable to similarly named indicators used by other companies. EBITDA and Core EBITDA EBITDA corresponds to operating income (loss) rest ated for depreciation and amortization (Note B.5 of the financial statements) and net impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Note B.6 of the financial statements). In addition to EBITDA, the Group presents Core EBITDA, which is a monitoring indicator of the underlying performance of the business after restatemen t for certain expenses and/or income that do not reflect the Group's operating performance. Core EB ITDA thus corresponds to EBITDA restated for restructuring costs and similar items (excluding de preciation and write-downs ), allocations net of reversals of unutilized provisions for environmental risks, and other items not representative of the Group's current operating performance or related to th e effects of acquisitions or disposals. EUROAPI considers that the exclusion of these items allows investors to better understa nd the underlying economic performance of the Group, consider ing that the exclusion of these items better reflects the current operating performance of the company. In particular, in the future the Group plans to exclude from its Core EBITDA expenses related to its initial listing, such as those resulti ng from the exceptional allocation of free shares to certain executives (see \" Exceptional allocation of free shares to cert ain executives in connection with the listing \" of section 14.1.3 \" Allotment of stock options \" of the Prospectus), the \"co-invest ment\" plan (described in Section 14.1.2 \"Remuneration of the corporate officers\" of the Prospectus) and the employee shareholding plan (described in Section 16.3.4 \" Employee stock ownership plans \" of the Prospectus), as it considers that they do not reflect the Group's current operating perfo rmance. This exclusion has no impact on financial years 2019, 2020 and 2021. Restructuring costs and similar items are detailed in Note D.25.2 of the Group financial statements, and allocations net of reversals of unutilized provi sions for environmental risks in Note D.10. 119The reconciliation of operating income (loss) to EBITDA and Core EBITDA is presented in the table61 below: (\u20ac million) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Operating income (loss) (12.8) (10.8) (0.5) amortization(1) 76.0 72.2 58.6 EBITDA 63.2 61.3 similar items excluding depreciation and amortization(2) 3.3 2.1 1.2 Allocations net of reversals of unutilized provisions for environmental risks(3) 3.1 3.8 12.4 Other(4) 2.6 0.0 0.0 Core EBITDA 72.2 67.2 71.7 (1) This restatement corresponds to the ite m entitled \"Depreciation, amortization and im pairment of property, plant and equipme nt, intangible assets and right-of-use assets\" in the cash flow statement of the financial statements . This item also includes amortization an d impairment relating to \"restructuring costs and similar items\". (2) This restatement corresponds to restructuring costs and sim ilar items (excluding depreciation and amortization) as disclose d in Note D.25.2 of the Group financial statements. (3) See Notes D.10 and D.25.2 of the financial statements. (4) Includes other items not representative of the Group's curre nt operating performance and more specifically for financial ye ar 2021, a labor dispute in Italy for \u20ac0.9 million and a provi sions of \u20ac1.7 million recognized for a commer cial lease. See Note D.25.2 of the fi nancial statements. Changes in EBITDA and Core EBITDA for the y ears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, are presented in Section 8.2.12 \" Alternative performance indicators relating to results \" of the Prospectus. Core FCF Conversion The Core FCF Conversion indicator is presented in Section 9.5.4 \" Core FCF conversion \" of the Prospectus. (b) Restated performance indicators taking into account the new EUROAPI business model resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transactions In order to ensure the comparability of key financ ial indicators for the three years included in the Prospectus, the tables below present restated financ ial indicators for the Group for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, to incorpor ate the effects of EUROAPI's new business model resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transactions. The new EUROAPI business model resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transactions, effective as of the date of the Prospectus, gives rise to differe nces with the historical business relationships between the Group and the entities of the Sanofi group, whic h have a significant effect on the Group's key financial indicators. Presentation of restatements relating to the new EUROAPI business model resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transactions In addition to the completion of the Prior Reor ganization Transactions described in Section 7.1 \"Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus, the Company and its subsidiaries have entered into agreements rela ting to the development, manufacture, supply and distribution of certain APIs, the supply of services and the granting of licenses with subsidiaries of 61 The reconciliation of operating income (loss) to EB ITDA and Core EBITDA is also presented in Note D.25.2. \" Segment result \" to the Group's financial statements. 120Sanofi that are not subsidiaries of the Company. For more information on these agreements, see Chapter 18 \" Related-party transactions \" of the Prospectus. The restatements presented below are intended to retroactively reflect the new agreements entered into. Their purpose is to cancel cost allocations relating to the shared functions in th e Sanofi perimeter and to retrospectively apply the effects of the target organizational structure at th e end of 2021 as if these new agreements had been put in place as of January 1, 2019: - Sanofi contracts:62 the restatement consists of applying retrospectively the terms and conditions of the agreements entered into by and between EUROAPI and Sanofi, effective from October 1, 2021,63 and agreed for an initial term of five y ears from the Loss of Control by Sanofi. The Sanofi agreements affected by the restatement are: o The Global Manufacturing and Supply Ag reement: covering 86 APIs and/or intermediates and/or other substances pr oduced by EUROAPI that are necessary for the manufacture of medicines marketed by the Sanofi group or manufactured by Sanofi on behalf of its customers. This restatement c onsists of retroactively applying the sales prices as agreed at the effective date in the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement to historical business volumes. o Distribution Agreement: covering the 22 APIs produced by Sanofi and for which EUROAPI is responsible for commercial dist ribution as of December 31, 2021. This restatement consists of retroactively a pplying the distribution agreement's terms (purchase price from Sanofi), as agreed at th e effective date of the agreements, to historical business volumes. o Reverse Manufacturing and Supply Agreements: 64 covering contracts for which part of the production is carried out by Sanofi. In 2020, 35 APIs were concerned. This restatement consists of retroactively applying the prices , as agreed on the Reverse Manufacturing and Supply Agreements effectiv e date, to historical business volumes. - Secondary packaging (UK):65 This adjustment consists of retrospectively converting the business model of the labeling and secondary pack aging activity carried out by EUROAPI in the United Kingdom. Prior to the new agreements signed on October 1, 2021, and effective as of January 1, 2022, the Haverhill site purchased and resold to Sanofi, according to the group's transfer pricing policy, the inventory of goods for which it was responsible for labeling and packaging. Under the new model, EUROAPI will no longer own the inventory but will be compensated by a toll fee for the labeling and secondary packaging services it performs. - Target organizational structure : The restatement consists of canceling the central costs of the Sanofi group allocated to EUROAPI and appl ying retrospectively the effects of the implementation of the target organizationa l structure allowing EUROAPI to operate autonomously. The costs corresponding to the target organizational structure include, on the one hand, personnel costs 66 calculated on the basis of the num ber of full-time equivalent (FTEs) required per function and the applicable market sal aries, and on the other hand, other costs and 62 Described in Sections 18.3.1 \" Manufacturing and supply agreements for certain APIs \" of the Prospectus for the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement and the Reverse Manufacturing and Supply Agreements, and 18.3.3 \" Distribution agreement for certain APIs \" of the Prospectus for the distribution agreement. 63 For some countries, the agreements came into force af ter October 1, 2021. This is the case, for example, for Germany and Hungary, where the agreements came into force on November 1, 2021. 64 A description of these agreements can be found in Section 18.3.1 \" Manufacturing and supply agreements for certain APIs \" of the Prospectus. 65 See the special agreement between the Group and the Sanofi group relating to the packaging of pharmaceutical products described in Section 18.3.1 \" Manufacturing and supply agreements for certain APIs \" of the Prospectus. 66 The Group has retroactively restated the effects of inflation on salaries . 121external services. These restatements have been estimated with the support of external consultants on the basis of both actual costs in curred by the Group and benchmarks of market practices. The additional costs compared to the historical accounts are mainly related to the implementation of the Finance, Legal and Hu man Resources functions, the Insurance function and the IT function. This target organizational st ructure will be fully effective within a 36-month period from October 1, 2021, i.e., by October 1, 2024, at the latest, but most of the recruitments should be completed by the date of the Company' s initial listing. In addition, the restatement also includes the re-invoicing of project cost s between Sanofi and EUROAPI that were not historically re-invoiced in the organization that preceded the Prior Reorganization Transactions (in the future, these re-invoicing transactions will be governed by the \" Special agreements between the Group and the Sanofi group relating to the development of APIs \" described in Section 18.3.2 of the Prospectus). Finally, it should be noted that the Transitional Services Agreements,67 which organize exchanges of services be tween EUROAPI and Sanofi, have been put in place with effect from October 1, 2021, in order to ensure the continuity of functions not yet performed by EUROAPI. The effects of thes e agreements on the last quarter of 2021 are canceled in the restated 2021 data, as the restat ements related to the target organizational structure already comprise these functions as if EUROAPI had them. - Scope adjustments : This restatement concerns certain APIs manufactured at Sanofi's sites, which will remain the property of Sanofi. These c ontracts were managed within the historical scope of EUROAPI but were not transferred as part of the Prior Reorganization Transactions. - Others : The other restatements concerned a few sp ecific items. The main restatement concerned the 2019 financial year and consisted in cance ling a non-operational environmental provision, which was the subject of a specific indemnity from Sanofi under the Master Carve-Out Agreement (see Section 18.1 \" Agreements signed by the Sano fi group and the Group for the execution of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus for further information). A second restatement consisted in considering the change in the APIs industrial cost over the 2019-2021 period in conjunc tion with the retroactive applica tion of selling prices as agreed at the effective date of the Global Manufactur ing and Supply Agreement and the Reverse Manufacturing and Supply Agreements. This r estatement has resulted in a net increase in manufacturing costs in 2019 and 2020. Finally, a third adjustment resulted in the cancellation of a provision recognized on a product that will re main within the scope of Sanofi, and for which the associated sales and direct costs have been adjusted in the \"Scope adjustments\" column. The Company and its subsidiaries have entered in to amendments to the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, one of the Reverse Manufact uring and Supply Agreements, the Distribution Agreement and the Secondary Packag ing Agreement (UK) with the Sanofi group, the financial impact of which is subsequent to December 31, 2021. These amendments have no impact on the restated financial information presented below (see Chapter 18 \" Related-party transactions \" of the Prospectus). 67 These agreements are described in Section 18.3.4 \" Service supply agreements \" of the Prospectus. 122Restated data for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 The tables below summarizes the various types of rest atements applied to the Group's indicators for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and present a reconciliation with the published indicators.

As indicated in the \"Presentation of the restatemen ts for the new EUROAPI business model resulting from the Prior Reorganization Tran sactions\", the restatement for the \"Sanofi contracts\" includ es the Distribution Agreement and the Reverse Manuf acturing and Supply Agreements. These contr acts favorably affect the purchasing ter ms with Sanofi and, therefore, the gross profit without affecting revenue. (2) The restatements for the Sanof i contracts generate a decrease in the revenue r ecorded with other cust omers due to the recla ssification of a sale historically made with a customer ot her than Sanofi: in the framework of the new business model, Sanofi will retain the co mmercial relationship with this customer and the sale made was therefore reclassified as a sale to Sanofi. (3) In line with the proposed initial listing of the API activity announced by Sanofi on February 24, 2020, the Company began t o structure its target organization in 2020 by recr uiting management teams, which therefore explai ns the progressive decrease in the restatemen t for the \"target organizational structure\" between 2019 and 2021. (4) The restatement on revenue from contracts with Sanofi is lowe r in 2019 due to an adjustment related to the more favorable t ransfer pricing mechanism in 2019 as reflected in the financial statements of EUROAPI. Historical data Restatements Restated data \u20ac million Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 944.6 Core EBITDA represented 17.0%, 11.4% and 12.3% of the restated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Restated gross profit, restated EBITDA and r estated Core EBITDA represented 15.7%, 10.7% and 11.3% of the restated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Restated gross profit, restated EBITDA and restat ed Core EBITDA represente d 13.7%, 8.4% and 9.0% of the restated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. 124As restated gross profit corresponds to the restated re venue minus the restated cost of sales, the restated cost of sales amounted to \u20ac748.9 million, \u20ac805. 1 million and \u20ac769.2 millio n for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The restated cost of sales thus represented 83.0%, 84.3% and 86.3% of restated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition to the restated indicators presented a bove, the Company presents \"Selling and distribution expenses\", \"Research and development expenses\", a nd \"Other operating expenses\" restated for the effects of the new EUROAPI business model result ing from the Prior Reorganization Transactions as previously described. The tables below summarize the various types of restatements applied and present a reconciliation with the accounting aggregates reported.

The Group's revenue, restated for EUROAPI's new business model resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transactions, amounted to \u20ac902.2 million at December 31, 2021, compared to restated revenues of \u20ac954.9 million and \u20ac891.6 million for th e years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted pharmaceutical comp anies to build up high inventories in 2020, which reduced demand for APIs in 2021. Sales in 2021 were impacted by the priority use of inventories built up in 2020 and by a decline in demand for certain APIs, in particular Pristinamycin (accounted for under CDMO), due to the decline in certain diseases as a result of government sanitary measures. Sales of certain APIs have increased strongly, such as Dexamethasone following the World Health Organization's recommendation for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19, and the Group has been able to seize commercial opportunities to produce certa in APIs used in treatments against COVID-19. For more information on the impact of th e COVID-19 pandemic, see Section 8.1.2(a) \" Change in the supply and demand of APIs \" of the Prospectus. 127(a) Breakdown of revenue by flow and type For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Group gene rated 54.4% of its reve nue from other customers and 45.6% from Sanofi. Since October 1, 2021, sal es to Sanofi have been governed by the terms of several agreements, including the Global Manufactur ing and Supply Agreement. In order to present information that is comparable w ith the entry into force of the new business model on October 1, 2021, the Group also presents a breakdown of its revenue by fl ow on a restated basis, applying retrospectively the terms of the new agreements with Sanofi. The Group also presents its revenue according to the sales' nature, which are split between APIs from the EUROAPI catalog (API Solutions) and sales made under CDMO contracts. In the case of CDMO sales, the APIs are developed and then produced on an exclusive basis for a single customer who remains the owner of the intellectual property. The following table presents sales by cash flow and by type from the consolidated financial statements for the periods indicated: (\u20ac million unless otherwise indicated) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Revenue from customers other than Sanofi 485.9 from customers than Sanofi: For the year ended December 31, 2021, the amoun t of revenue from other customers decreased by \u20ac4.8 million, from \u20ac490.7 million for the year ended D ecember 31, 2020, to \u20ac485.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, re presenting 54.4% of consolidated revenue compared to 51.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the amount of API Solutions' sales (excluding Sanofi) decreased by \u20ac14.3 million, from \u20ac345.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to \u20ac331.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primar ily tied to a decline in demand on certain APIs due to the COVID-19 crisis (see the sub-section \" Impacts related to a global sanitary crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic \" in Section 8.1.2(a) \" Change in the supply and demand of APIs \" of the Prospectus) and the postponement to financial year 2022 of certa in deliveries of APIs resulting from the Group's Prior Reorganization Transactions that took place in the last quarter of 2021. The Company estimates the negative impact related to the delay in these deliv eries at \u20ac15 million over financial year 2021. This decline in revenue was partially offset by the increase in sales of hormones over the year ended December 31, 2020, a year in which the building at Vertolaye dedicated to hormones had been shut down temporarily due to regulatory restrictions that required compliance work. The increase in sales of hormones between 2021 and 2020 tota led approximately \u20ac18 million. 128For the year ended December 31, 2021, CDMO sale s (excluding Sanofi) increased by \u20ac9.5 million, from \u20ac145.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to \u20ac154.9 milli on for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily related to an in crease in revenue generated on the Catalent contract in the United Kingdom and the development of sal es of oligonucleotides with an American biotech company. For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales (e xcluding Sanofi) increased by \u20ac23.0 million, from \u20ac467.7 million for the year ended D ecember 31, 2019, to \u20ac490.7 milli on for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing 51.9% of consolidated revenue compared to 51.1% as of December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the amount of API Solutions' sales (excluding Sanofi) decreased by \u20ac8.4 million, from \u20ac353.7 millio n for the year ended December 31, 2019, to \u20ac345.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease is mainly due to (i) temporary production stoppages related to a regulatory update of the manufacturing facility at the Vertolaye site for Altrenogest and Trenbolone following a change in the classification of these products, and (ii) a six-month shutdown of the Prostaglandins production building at the Ujpest site in Hungary in order to carry out maintenance operations and increase production capacity. Howeve r, these decreases were offset by the good performance of vitamin B12 and Metamizole sales. For the year ended December 31, 2020, CDMO sales (excluding Sanofi) increased by \u20ac31.4 million, from \u20ac114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to \u20ac145.4 millio n for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly due to (i) increased sal es related to the Olmesartan, Gamithromicyn and Afoxolaner contracts and (ii) revenues from new CDMO contracts in the UK and Germany. Revenue from Sanofi: For the year ended December 31, 2021, the amount of direct sales to Sanofi decreased by \u20ac47.0 million, from \u20ac453.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to \u20ac406.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing 45.6% of consolidat ed revenues compared to 48.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, API Solu tions revenue generated with Sanofi decreased by \u20ac31.8 million, from \u20ac371.0 million for the year ended D ecember 31, 2020, to \u20ac339 .2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was driven primarily by (i) a decrease in the API demand in 2021, in particular, for Sevelamer, Fexofenadine, Buserelin and Ramipril68, and (ii) bid tenders lost in China by the customer Sanofi, generating a decrease in revenue69 on sales of Teicoplanin compared with the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, CDMO sales with Sanofi decreased by \u20ac15.3 million, from \u20ac82.9 million for the year ended D ecember 31, 2020, to \u20ac67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decline is primarily tied to a sharp dec line in demand for Pristinamycin due to the decrease in certain infectious pathologies resulting from the san itary protection measures to prevent the spread of COVID-1970. Nevertheless, this decrease was partially offset by higher sales of Lixisenatide and Lademirsen. 68 Products for which the Group recorded a decrease in revenue restated for the new EUROAPI business model resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transacti ons of approximately \u20ac13. 3 million, \u20ac10.1 million, \u20ac5.0 million and \u20ac4.3 million compared with financial year 2020. 69 Estimated at approximately \u20ac8.6 million on a ba sis restated for the new EUROAPI business model resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transactions. 70 See sub-section \" Impacts related to a global health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic \" of Section 8.1.2(a) \" Change in the supply and demand of APIs \" of the Prospectus. 129For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales to Sanofi increased by \u20ac5.8 million, from \u20ac448.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to \u20ac453.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 48.1% of consolidated revenue compared to 48.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, API Solu tions revenue generated with Sanofi decreased by \u20ac13.4 million, from \u20ac384.4 million for the year ended D ecember 31, 2019, to \u20ac371 .0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease is mainly rela ted to the decrease in steroid sales. Nevertheless, this decrease was partially offset by higher sales of Sevelamer and Fexofenadine. For the year ended December 31, 2020, CDMO sales with Sanofi increased by \u20ac19.2 million, from \u20ac63.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to \u20ac82.9 million for th e year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenue for the period is mainly rela ted to the Pristinamycin and Avalglucosidase alpha intermediate contracts. The table below shows the restated revenue for the periods indicated, by flow: (\u20ac million unless otherwise indicated) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Restated revenue from customers other than Sanofi 459.0 50.9% (b) Breakdown of revenue by product category The Group produces and distributes a diversified portfolio of products, including the main categories of APIs. The table below shows sales by product category for the periods indicated. 130(\u20ac million unless otherwise indicated) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Complex chemical synthesis molecules 613.5 68.7% 915.8 100.0% Complex chemical synthesis molecules For the year ended December 31, 2021, the amount of sales of \"Complex chemical synthesis molecules\" decreased by \u20ac47.5 million from \u20ac661.0 million for the y ear ended December 31, 2020 to \u20ac613.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The drop in re venue over the period is pr imarily tied to the drop in demand for Sevelamer Ramipril as well as a decrease in the sales of Methylprednisolone, Prednisone and Prednisolone. For the year ended December 31, 20 20, sales of \"Complex chemical s ynthesis molecules\" increased by \u20ac26.5 million from \u20ac634.5 million for the year ended D ecember 31, 2019 to \u20ac661.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenue over the period was mainly due to higher sales of APIs related to hyperphosphatemia, higher sales of Fexofenadine and Ramipril. This increase was partially offset by lower sales of steroids during the period. Biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales of \"B iochemistry molecules derived from fermentation\" decreased by \u20ac36.2 million, from \u20ac188.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to \u20ac152.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 . The decline in revenue over the period is tied first to the decline in sales of Pristinamycin due to the decrease in certain infectious pathologies resulting from governmental protection measures resulting from the spread of COVID-19 (see the sub-section \"Impacts related to a global sanitary crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic \" of Section 8.1.2(a) \"Change in the supply and demand of APIs \" of the Prospectus) and second, to a decrease in sales on Teicoplanin following the loss of a Sanofi bid tender in China. For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales of \"B iochemistry molecules derived from fermentation\" increased by \u20ac27.1 million, from \u20ac161.3 million for the y ear ended December 31, 2019 to \u20ac188.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenue over the period was mainly due to higher sales of vitamin B12 and higher sales of Pristinamycin. HP-APIs For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales of \"H P-APIs\" increased by \u20ac24.0 million, rising from \u20ac81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to \u20ac105.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in revenue over the period is primarily tied, firs t to the increase in hormone sales compared with the year ended December 31, 2020, a year in which the building dedicated to hormones at Vertolaye had been shut down temporarily because of regulatory restrictions that required compliance work and, second, to the increase in sales of Prostaglandins compared with the year ended December 31, 2020, a year in which the building dedicated to th e Prostaglandins at the Ujpest site in Hungary had been shut down for maintenance operati ons and to increase production capacities. 131In the year ended December 31, 2020, sales of \"HP-APIs\" decreased by \u20ac31.6 million, from \u20ac113.0 million in the year ended D ecember 31, 2019 to \u20ac81.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in revenue over the period was mainly due to the Vertolaye hormone manufacturing facility shutdown to bring it up to standard in 2020, and the Prostaglandin manufacturing facility shutdown at the Ujpest site in Hungary for six m onths to carry out maintenance work and increase production capacity. Large molecules In the year ended December 31, 2021, the amount of sales of \"large molecules\" increased by \u20ac7.9 million, from \u20ac13.8 million reported in the year ended December 31, 2020 to \u20ac21.7 million reported in the year ended December 31, 2021. The in crease in revenue over the period comes from the development of sales of oligonucleotides with an American biotech company and the increase in sales with Sanofi due to the CDMO projects on Lixisena tide and Lademirsen. This increase was partially offset by lower sales of Buserelin. During the year ended December 31, 2020, sales of \"large molecules\" incre ased by \u20ac6.8 million, from \u20ac7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to \u20ac13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenue over the period was prim arily due to an increase in sales of peptides and oligonucleotides. The table below shows restated revenue by product category for the periods indicated: (\u20ac million unless otherwise indicated) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Complex chemical synthesis molecules 620.1 68.7% 100.0% 8.2.2 Cost of sales and gross profit Cost of sales decreased by \u20ac70.4 million, or 8.2%, in the year ende d December 31, 2021, from \u20ac854.1 million in the year ended D ecember 31, 2020, to \u20ac783.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, and increased by \u20ac25.9 million, or 3.1% , in the year ended December 31, 2020, from \u20ac828.2 million in the year ended D ecember 31, 2019, to \u20ac854.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross profit increased by \u20ac18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from \u20ac90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to \u20ac109.1 m illion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the gross profit is driven primarily by an increase in the relative weight of the CDMO activity in the Group's consolidated revenue, and by the im provement in the industr ial performance (better yields, debottlenecking actions and the progress ma de on maintenance operations) estimated at approximately \u20ac8 million for the year ended Decemb er 31, 2021. Gross profit rose from 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, to 12.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021. 132Gross profit increased by \u20ac2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from \u20ac87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to \u20ac90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly attributable to a better industrial perfo rmance in 2020 and an increase in revenue from the CDMO activities, which is a more value-creating ac tivity. This increase was partially offset by the effects of the launch of an inventory reduction plan71 and the destruction of several batches. Gross profit remained stable at 9.6% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. 8.2.3 Selling and distribution expenses Selling and distribution expenses increased by \u20ac7.1 milli on, or 26.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, from \u20ac26.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to \u20ac34.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, and increased by \u20ac1.7 million, or 6.8%, in the year ende d December 31, 2020, from \u20ac25.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, to \u20ac26.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Over the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in selling and distribution expenses was primarily driven by recruitments done by the Company to build out its target organizational structure in line with its proposed initial listing. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in selling and distribution expenses was primarily due to the proportional increase in distributi on costs in relation to sales for the period. 8.2.4 Research and development expenses Research and development expen ses decreased by \u20ac2.9 million, or 14.7% , in the year ended December 31, 2021, from \u20ac19.9 million in the year ended Decem ber 31, 2020, to \u20ac17.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, and increased by \u20ac3.6 million, or 22.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, from \u20ac16.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, to \u20ac19.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. 8.2.5 Administrative and general expenses Administrative and general expenses increased by \u20ac12.7 million, or 29.7% , in the year ended December 31, 2021, from \u20ac42.7 million in the year ended Decem ber 31, 2020, to \u20ac55.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, and increased by \u20ac3.4 million, or 8.8%, in the year ende d December 31, 2020, from \u20ac39.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, to \u20ac42.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in administrative and general e xpenses over the year ended December 31, 2021, is primarily tied to the many new recruitments made by the Company to build out its target organizational structure in line with its proposed initial listing. 8.2.6 Other operating income and expenses Other operating income increased by \u20ac2.9 million, fr om an income of \u20ac1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to an income of \u20ac4.2 m illion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other operating income was relatively stable for th e year ended December 31, 2020, decreasing to an income of \u20ac1.3 million from an in come of \u20ac1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other operating expenses decreased by \u20ac5.2 million, from an expense of \u20ac10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to an expense of \u20ac5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Over the year ended December 31, 2021, other operating expenses primarily reflected: (i) a depreciation of \u20ac2.0 million recognized for a commercial lease,72 effective as of July 1, 2021, and not used and (ii) a 71 See Section 9.4.1 \" Financing of working capital requirements \" of the Prospectus. 72 See Note D.2.2 of the financial statements. 133\u20ac2.4 million allocation for environmental risk at the non-operational sites, primarily concerning the parcels at Vertolaye in France.73 Other operating expenses increased for the year ende d December 31, 2020, to an expense of \u20ac10.6 million from an expense of \u20ac8.8 million fo r the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other op erating expenses were mainly composed of a \u20ac9.8 million charge for the accounting of an impair ment loss on non-commissioned industrial assets due to the discontinuation of the phospholipid manufacturi ng project in Frankfurt following the decline in sales volumes in the major market s, namely, China and Russia. For the year ended December 31, 2019, other opera ting expenses consisted ma inly of a \u20ac9.0 million expense relating to a provision for environmental risks recognized mainly at non-operating sites in France. 8.2.7 Restructuring costs and similar items Over the year ended December 31, 2021, restructur ing costs and similar items totaled \u20ac13.4 million and primarily concerned the plan to redirect the Group's ac tivities in Italy, with a depreciation of \u20ac8.9 million on certain equipment at the Brindisi site and \u20ac4.0 mi llion in restructuring costs other than costs related to personnel and assets tied to the temporary shutdown of the Brindisi site resulting from the redirection plan initiated at the end of 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, restructurin g costs and similar items amounted to \u20ac2.4 million and consisted of employee-relate d expenses, as well as charges, gains or losses on assets. Employee- related expenses included a provision of \u20ac14.7 million for severance payments in connection with the \"Play-to-Win\" plan undertaken by the Sanofi group to adapt its organization as part of its strategic changes. The Group also recognized a reversal of an unused provision for UCI74 stocks in the amount of \u20ac13.7 million. In 2020, the new pr ojections for disposal of inventor ies have led the Group to reverse a large portion of the provision for disposal of inventories recognized in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2019, restructuring costs and similar items accounted for net income of \u20ac0.1 million, corresponding on the one hand to employee-related expenses of \u20ac1.2 million, and on the other hand to a \u20ac1.3 million impairment reversal corresponding to the return to service of an impaired item of property, plant and equipment. See Note D.18 of the financial statements for further details. 8.2.8 Operating income (loss) Taking into account items presented above, operating income (loss) decreased by \u20ac2.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from an operating inco me (loss) of \u20ac(10.8) million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to an operating income (loss) of \u20ac(12.8) million in the year ended December 31, 2021, and decreased by \u20ac10.3 million in the year ende d December 31, 2020, from \u20ac(0.5) million in the year ended December 31, 2019, to \u20ac(10.8) m illion in the year ended December 31, 2020. 8.2.9 Financial expenses and income Financial expenses and income changed from a net fina ncial expense of \u20ac(0.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to a net financ ial expense of \u20ac(1.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of \u20ac1.0 million, and from a net financia l expense of \u20ac(2.6) m illion for the year ended 73 See Note D.10 of the financial statements. 74 UCI: Universal Corticosteroid Intermediary. 134December 31, 2019, to a net financ ial expense of \u20ac(0.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of \u20ac1.6 million. It should be noted that the financing of EUROAPI activities was assured mainly by Sanofi for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019 (see Note A.3.3 of the financial statements). As pa rt of this financing, EUROAPI benefited from the financial conditions applicable to Sanofi's subsidiaries. In connection with the Company's initial listing, the Group has set up an auto nomous financing structure. For this purpose, the Group has set up the \u20ac451 million RCF Loan Agreement (see Section 9.2.2(a) \" RCF Loan Agreement \" of the Prospectus). The RCF Loan Agreement ma y be drawn down as from the initial listing of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. 8.2.10 Income taxes Income tax increased by \u20ac6.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from tax proceeds of \u20ac5.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to a tax charge of \u20ac(1.2) million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This change is the result of the increase in current taxes of \u20ac7.1 million from \u20ac(11.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 , to \u20ac(18.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Deferred taxes, meanwhile, increased by \u20ac0.4 million over the period, rising from \u20ac16.7 million for the year ended D ecember 31, 2020, to \u20ac17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Income tax represented tax proceeds of \u20ac5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to tax proceeds of \u20ac5.6 million for the year ended D ecember 31, 2019. This ch ange is related to a decrease in deferred taxes of \u20ac4.1 million in the y ear ended December 31, 2020, from \u20ac20.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, to \u20ac16.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, offset by the decrease in current taxes of \u20ac4.0 million in the y ear ended December 31, 2020, from \u20ac(15.2) million in the year ended December 31, 2019, to \u20ac(11.2) million in the year ended December 31, 2020. 8.2.11 Net income (loss) As a result of the changes described in the sections above, the Group's net income (loss) decreased by \u20ac9.5 million in the year ended Decembe r 31, 2021, from a net income (loss) of \u20ac(6.3) million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to a net income (loss) of \u20ac(15.8) m illion in the year ended December 31, 2021, and decreased by \u20ac8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from a net income (loss) of \u20ac2.5 million for the year ended Decembe r 31, 2019, to a net income (loss) of \u20ac(6.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 1358.2.12 Alternative performance indicators related to results The table below shows the reconciliation of EBIT DA and Core EBITDA with the Group's operating income (loss) as previously discussed: (\u20ac million) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Operating income (loss) (12.8) (10.8) (0.5) amortization(1) 76.0 72.2 58.6 EBITDA 63.2 61.3 similar items excluding depreciation and amortization(2) 3.3 2.1 1.2 Allocations net of reversals of unutilized provisions for environmental risks(3) 3.1 3.8 12.4 Other(4) 2.6 0.0 0.0 Core EBITDA 72.2 67.2 71.7 (1) This restatement corresponds to the ite m entitled \"Depreciation, amortization and im pairment of property, plant and equipme nt, intangible assets and right-of-use assets\" in the cash flow statement of the financial statements .

See Note D.25.2 of the financial statements. EBITDA was \u20ac63.2 million, \u20ac61.3 m illion and \u20ac58.1 million for the year s ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Core EBITDA increased in the year ended Decemb er 31, 2021, from \u20ac67.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to \u20ac72.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Core EB ITDA decreased by \u20ac4.4 million, compared with \u20ac71.7 million for the year ended D ecember 31, 2019, to \u20ac67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 8.2.13 Restated alternative performance indicators relating to results The restated alternative performance indicat ors derived from the income statement ( Revenue, Gross Profit, EBITDA, Core EBITDA ) are summarized in the table below.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 9.1 Overview The Group's main financing requirements include its working capital requirements and capital expenditure (see Section 6.8 \" Investments \" of the Prospectus). At December 31, 2021, and during the years ende d December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Group's main sources of cash were as follows: - Net cash provided by (used in) operating activiti es which amounted to \u20ac71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, \u20ac 96.8 million and \u20ac34.9 million for the 2020 and 2019 financial years, respectively (see Section 9.2.1 \" Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities \" of the Prospectus). - EUROAPI activities were mainly financed by Sa nofi for financial years 2021, 2020 and 2019 (see Note A.3.3 of the financial statements). As part of this financing, EUROAPI benefited from the financing terms applicable within the Sanofi group. In connection with the Company's initial listi ng, the Group has set up an autonomous financing structure. To this effect, the Group has set up a \u20ac 451 million revolving credit facility (the \"RCF Loan Agreement\") (see Section 9.2.2(a) \" RCF loan agreement \" of the Prospectus). The RCF Loan Agreement may be drawn down as from the initial listing of th e Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. As was the case for the years e nded December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Group considers that for financial year 2022, its financing needs will mainly include its current operating requirements and its capital expenditure. The following information on the Group's cash fl ow should be read jointly with the Group's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 presented in Section 19.1 \" Historical financial information \" of the Prospectus, which is the subject of the audit report from the statutory auditor provided in Section 19.3 \" Audit of historical annual financial information \" of the Prospectus. 9.2 Financial resources and liabilities 9.2.1 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities Net cash provided by (used in) operating activ ities amounted, respectivel y, to \u20ac71.5 million, \u20ac96.8 million and \u20ac34.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 202 0 and 2019. A detailed analysis of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 is presented in Section 9.5.1 \" Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities \" of the Prospectus. The Group's ability to generate cash from its operating activities in the future will depend on its future operating performance, which in turn will depend to some extent on economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond the Group's control. 9.2.2 Financial liabilities The short-term debt and other fi nancial liabilities toward Sanofi amount ed, respectively, to \u20ac1.4 million, \u20ac55.8 million and \u20ac44.2 million for the years ended D ecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The decrease between December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021, was due to the repayment of the Francopia debt to Sanofi. 138 Lease liabilities amounted to \u20ac22.7 million, \u20ac17.5 m illion and \u20ac20.0 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Group's lease liabilities are detailed in Note D.9 of the Notes to the Group's financial statements for the years ende d December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. On February 22, 2022, the Group entered into a \u20ac451 million RCF Loan Agreement with a banking syndicate composed of BNP Paribas, Bank of Ameri ca, JP Morgan, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Deutsche Bank and Natixis (the \"Lenders\") which expires on February 26, 2027. (a) RCF Loan Agreement The purpose of the RCF Loan Agreement is to finance the Group's general cash needs and its acquisitions. It is governed by Fr ench law, and the Company will have the option to make drawdowns under this agreement as of the Company's notifica tion to the Lenders of the initial listing of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Eurone xt Paris. As a general rule, drawdowns are not subject to prior authorization from the Lenders, but ar e subject only to the absence of an early repayment event and the accuracy of the usual repeated representations. Only drawdowns intended to finance large cap acquisitions are subject to the prior agreement of a two-thirds majority of the Lenders. Interest and fees Loans borrowed under the RCF Loan Ag reement will bear interest at a EURIBOR-indexed variable rate, plus an applicable margin. In the event that the EU RIBOR is below zero, this rate will be considered equal to zero. The applicable margin is initially set at 0.35% per annum, with an upward or downward adjustment mechanism (\"ratchet\"). The usual commi ssions such as a commitment fee and a utilization fee will also apply. The applicable margin varies depending on the ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated Core EBITDA as defined in the RCF Loan Agreement, but w ithout taking into account the effects of IFRS 16. The applicable margin level is re viewed every six months and will be calculated for the first time on the basis of the financial statements at December 31, 2022. The margin varies within a range of 0.35% and 1.10% as a function of the gearing ratio defined above. Covenants and restrictive clauses The RCF Loan Agreement contains certain affirma tive and negative commitments , subject to the usual exceptions for this type of financing, including: - the commitment not to divest, each year, more th an 15% of consolidated assets (or, if this amount is greater, assets in an amount greater than \u20ac200 million); - the commitment not to make large-cap acquisitions funded in whole or in part by the RCF Loan Agreement without the prior approval of the lenders; - the commitment not to create certain security interests (pledges); - the commitment not to enter into any merger , spin-off or regrouping transaction that would result in the dissolution of the Company; - the commitment by the Company's subsidiaries not to incur debt in an aggregate amount exceeding 20% of the Group's consolidated debt; and - the commitment not to grant loans to third parties or enter into transactions involving derivatives of a speculative nature. 139Finally, the Group will be required to maintain gear ing (consolidated net debt/Core EBITDA, without taking into account the effects of IFRS 16), tested every six months and, for the first time, for the period ending December 31, 2022, less than or equal to 4. 0x until maturity of th e RCF Loan Agreement. Voluntary early repayment The RCF Loan Agreement authorizes voluntary early repayments with prior notice and for a minimum amount. Mandatory early repayment The RCF Loan Agreement provides for repayment and/or early cancellation, in the event of a change of control of the Company, at the dema nd of any Lender made at the end of a consultati on period of at least 60 days. A change of control would occur in the event that (i) Sanofi ceases to hold, directly or indirectly, on a fully diluted basis, at least 15% of the capita l and voting rights of the Company and ceases to hold, directly or indirectly, the right to appoint or dismi ss a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, or (ii) any person (other than Sanofi) or group of pe rsons acting in concert (other than a concert in which Sanofi would hold a majority share), would acquire more than 50% of the voting rights of the Company or (iii) all or a substantial portion of the Group's assets would be sold to a non-Group member (in one or more transactions). Early repayment event The RCF Loan Agreement stipulates a certain number of early repayment events, which are usual for this type of financing, and include the usual cu re periods, including payment default, non-compliance with the financial ratio, the statutory auditors' refu sal to certify the Group's financial statements or the identification of significant reser vations, the suspension or cessation of the Group activities, failure to meet any other undertaking or make any representation under the RCF Loan Agreement, cross-default and cross-early repayment events related to the Compa ny or its principal subsidiaries, insolvency or the opening of bankruptcy proceedings ag ainst the Company or its principal subsidiaries, or the seizure of assets and certain judicial or regulatory judgments ag ainst the Company or its principal subsidiaries. (b) Sanofi Cash pool and other Sanofi current accounts The Group historically benefited from the centralized cash management agreem ent in place within the Sanofi group. The centralized cash management polic y entered into with Sanofi will end from the date of delivery and registration of the EUROAPI shares allocated under the Distribution in Kind, i.e., May 10, 2022. Furthermore, the Group has set up an in ternal cash pool system between the Company and its subsidiaries to centralize liquidity inside the Group. 9.3 Contractual obligations and off-balance sheet commitments The Group has contracted off-balance sheet commitm ents, including operating commitments as well as financing commitments with the entr y into the RCF Loan Agreement. At December 31, 2021, the net commitments given and related to the off-balance sheet items of EUROAPI operating activities amounted to \u20ac143. 2 million, including \u20ac0.3 million of lease commitments (corresponding to future minimum payments due under the leases) and \u20ac142.9 million under the non-cancelable purchase commitments. Th e non-cancelable purchase commitments include firm orders for property, plant and equipment (\u20ac25.5 million), as well as purchasing commitments for goods and services contracted under material supply ag reements net of the commitments received, which amounted to \u20ac117.4 million. 140In particular, the Group is required, under the RCF Loan Agreement, to comply with certain commitments described in Section 3.4.3 \" Liquidity risks \" (see also Section 9.2.2(a) \" RCF Loan Agreement \" of this Prospectus). The Group's contractual obligations and off-bala nce sheet commitments, including the principal commitments resulting from the agreements signed w ith Sanofi as part of the Prior Reorganization Transactions of the Group, are presented and described in Note D.23 of the financial statements. 9.4 Presentation and analysis of the main categories of use of the Group's cash 9.4.1 Financing of working capital requirements and of other current assets and liabilities Inventories amounted to \u20ac569.5 million at December 31, 2021, \u20ac584.1 million at December 31, 2020, and \u20ac596.9 million at December 31, 2019, i.e., a d ecrease of \u20ac14.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, and a decrease of \u20ac12.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in inventory levels over the period is primarily related to the program to reduce inventories initiated by the Group, as well as the drop in demand in 2021. Moreover, in the context of the Prior Reorganization Transactions, the Company purchased inventories for \u20ac25 million for the placement of the Reverse MSA covering the B12 salts and the Francopia activity. Accounts receivable amounted to \u20ac238.9 million at December 31, 20 21, \u20ac194.7 million at December 31, 2020, and \u20ac204.4 million at Decem ber 31, 2019, i.e., an increase of \u20ac44.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, and a decrease of \u20ac9.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in accounts receivable at December 31, 2021 primarily reflects the establishment of the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Sanofi. Accounts payable amounted to \u20ac1 89.6 million at December 31, 2021, \u20ac131.1 million at December 31, 2020, and \u20ac120.4 million at December 31, 2019, i.e., an increase of \u20ac58.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, and an increase of \u20ac10.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in accounts payable at December 31, 2021 is primarily the result of the temporary payments shutdowns that were necessary for the installation of the new IT systems, commissioned on the various dates of the Prior Reorganization Transactions. Working capital requirement mainly corresponds to the value of inventories plus accounts receivable and minus accounts payable. The Group's working capital requirement amounted to \u20ac618.8 million, 647.7 million and \u20ac680.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Other current assets amounted to \u20ac75.5 million at December 31, 2021, \u20ac51.3 million at December 31, 2020, and \u20ac39.9 million at December 31, 2019, i.e., an increase of \u20ac24.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, and an increase of \u20ac11.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase observed at December 31, 2021 is related to a VAT credit not paid at December 31, generated by the establishment of the subcontracting flows with Sanof i on October 1, 2021, and the establishment of the indemnification of environmental liabilities grante d by Sanofi on the non-operational sites, a portion of which is recognized in other current assets. Other current liabilities amounted to \u20ac192.7 million at December 31, 2021, \u20ac176.3 million at December 31, 2020, and \u20ac145.7 million at December 31, 2019, i.e ., an increase of \u20ac16.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, and an increase of \u20ac30.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in other liabilities primarily represents the increase in accounts payable for non-current assets. 9.4.2 Capital expenditures Total capital expenditures for the year ended D ecember 31, 2021 amounted to \u20ac88.6 million and \u20ac88.4 million and \u20ac81.8 million for the years ende d December 31, 2020 a nd 2019, respectively (representing 9.9%, 9.4% and 8.9% of consolidated re venues, respectively, or 9.8%, 9.3% and 9.2% of 141restated revenues). The Group's capital expenditu res include (i) maintenance and compliance investments required to maintain the value of an asset and/or adapt to market demands or comply with current HSE regulations and (ii) performance and growth investments to increase the Group's production capacities, particularly through purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Securities acquisitions are not included in capital expenditures. They correspond to the item \"Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible asset s\" in the statement of consolidated cash flow. For further information on capital expenditures, please refer to Section 6.8 \" Investments \" of the Prospectus. The table below presents the amount of capital expend itures made over the last three financial years: (\u20ac million) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment (111.6) (93.0) (84.5) Acquisitions of intangible assets (23.9) (2.6) (1.4) Change in debt for non-current assets 47.0 7.2 4.0 \"CAPEX\" (88.6) (88.4) (81.8) Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment rose in 2021 to support the Group's growth strategy, rising from \u20ac93.0 million for the year 2020 to \u20ac111.6 million for financial year 2021. Acquisitions of intangible assets rose sharply in 2021 due to the inst allation of the IT tools necessary to establish the autonomous organization of the Group. Due to the inv estments made over the last quarter of 2021, debt for non-current assets increased signifi cantly at December 31, 2021. The table below shows the breakdown of acquisitions of property, pl ant and equipment over the past three financial years: As a % Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Maintenance and compliance investments 70% 69% 64% Performance and growth investments 30% 31% 36% 9.4.3 Interest payment and repayment of financial debts In the absence of external financial debt, the fina ncial expenses presented in the Group's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are not representative of the financial terms that will apply to EUROAPI as from the implementation of the Group's autonomous financing structure. As part of the Company's initial listing, the Group will set up an autonomous financing structure. To this effect, the Group intends to set up a \u20ac451 million RCF Loan Agreement with a banking syndicate (see Section 9.2.2(a) \" RCF Loan Agreement \" of the Prospectus). The RCF Loan Agreement may be drawn down as from the initial lis ting of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. 9.5 The Group's consolidated cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 The table below presents the group's cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: 142(\u20ac million) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 71.5 96.8 34.9 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (87.9) (88.3) (81.2) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 26.5 (8.4) 46.2 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 10.3 0.1 (0.1) Cash and cash equivalents totaled \u20ac10.3 million at December 31, 2021, with a balance of \u20ac0.1 million at December 31, 2020, and a zero balance at Decemb er 31, 2019, given the existence of a centralized cash agreement within the Sanofi group, which hist orically benefited the entities included in the EUROAPI scope. For more details, please refer to the financial statements. 9.5.1 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities The table below presents net cash provided by (used in) Group operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: (\u20ac million) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Net income (loss) attributable to equity holders (15.8) (6.3) 2.5 Depreciation, amortization and imp airment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets 76.0 72.2 58.6 (Gains)/losses on asset disposals (0.0) (0.0) (0.4) Net change in deferred taxes (17.1) (16.7) (20.8) Net change in non-current pr ovisions and other non-current liabilities (2.2) (4.5) 10.2 Cost of employee benefits (stock options and other share-based payments) 1.8 1.6 1.4 Other profit or loss items with no cash effect (0.1) (0.4) 0.3 Operating cash flow before changes in working capital 42.6 45.9 51.8 (Increase)/decrease in inventories 14.0 6.2 1.2 (Increase)/decrease in accounts receivable (131.0) 5.1 (30.3) Increase/(decrease) in accounts payable 88.9 11.9 (1.1) Net change in other current assets and other current liabilities 57.2 27.7 13.3 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 71.5 96.8 34.9 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activiti es amounted to \u20ac71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to \u20ac96.8 million fo r the year ended December 31, 2020, and to \u20ac34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash pr ovided by (used in) operating activities decreased by \u20ac25.3 million. This decline is primarily related to a deterioration in items forming the working capital requirement, in connection with the finalization of the Prior Reorganization Transactions in 2021. In the context of the Prior Reorganization Transactions, al l the \"accounts receivable and related items\" and \"accounts payable and related items\" were not contributed and, as a result, were settled on that date by the consideration for the contribution of the Sanofi parent company. The changes shown in the table 143above reflect the partial reconstitution of these elem ents of the working capital requirement for the receivables and payables of the activity at the end of this reorganization. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash pr ovided by (used in) operating activities increased by \u20ac61.9 million, despite a drop in operating cash flow be fore changes in working capital of \u20ac5.8 million. This increase primarily reflects an improvement in the items composing the working capital requirement in 2020 and a deterioration in 2019. 9.5.2 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities The table below presents net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: (\u20ac million) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Acquisitions of property, plant a nd equipment and intangible assets (Capital expenditures) (88.6) (88.4) (81.8) Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other non- current assets, net of tax 0.7 0.1 0.7 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (87.9) (88.3) (81.2) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities pr imarily corresponds to acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (or capital expenditures) (see Section 6.8 \" Investments \" and Section 9.4.2 \" Capital expenditures \" of the Prospectus). Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities amounted to \u20ac87.9 million for the financia l year ended December 31, 2021, \u20ac88.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, and \u20ac8 1.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. For further information on capital expe nditure, please refer to Section 6.8 \" Investments \" and Section 9.4.2 \" Capital expenditures \" of the Prospectus. 9.5.3 Net cash flow from (used in) financing activities The table below shows net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: (\u20ac million) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Dividends paid to Sanofi(1) 0.0 (4.7) (6.2) Repayment of lease liabilities (2.5) (2.6) (2.6) Net change in short-term debt 1.3 0.0 0.0 Contribution of the Sanofi parent entity 27.8 (1,2) 54.9 Other 0.0 0.1 0.0 Net cash provided by (used in) fi nancing activities 26.5 (8.4) 46.2 (1) Dividends paid by Francopia to Sanofi Chimie for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en participation (SEP \u2014 joint venture), which ceased to exist in December 2020. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activiti es amounted to \u20ac26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, \u20ac(8.4) million for the year e nded December 31, 2020, and \u20ac46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. 144The decrease in the contribution of the Sanofi parent entity in 2020 compared to financial year 2019 is primarily due to the improvement in net cash provi ded by (used in) operating activities as described in Section 9.5.1 \" Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities \" of the Prospectus, partially offset by the increase in financing needs related to investi ng activities conducted over the same period. In the absence of external financing over the reported pe riods, Sanofi's financings of EUROAPI's activities are reflected on the line \"Net contribution of Sanofi equity holders to the consolidated group\" in the statements of cash flows of the Compa ny's consolidated financial statements. The increase in 2021 in the contribution of the parent company Sanofi from financial year 2020 is primarily due to the deterioration in net cash pr ovided by (used in) operating activities as described in Section 9.5.1 \" Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities \" of the Prospectus. 9.5.4 Core FCF conversion Core Free Cash Flow conversion, or Core FCF conversion, is the Group's key performance indicator to analyze its cash flows (see Section 8.1.4 \" Main performance indicators \" of the Prospectus). This performance indicator is regularly tracked by the Gr oup to analyze and evaluate its businesses and their trends, measure their performance, prepare ear nings forecasts and make strategic decisions. Core FCF conversion corresponds to the ratio between, on the one hand, (i) cash flow generated by (used in) operating activities less the \"acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\"75 items, and restated for the \"net change in other current assets and other current liabilities\", \"current taxes\"76 and cash inflows and outflows relating to Core EBITDA77 restatements, and on the other hand (ii) Core EBITDA. Core FCF conversion, EBITDA and Core EBITDA are alternative performance indicators with respect to AMF position number 2015-12. Core FCF conversion, EBITDA and Core EBITDA are not standardized accounting aggregates that meet a gene rally accepted definition under IFRS. They should not be considered as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, which are measures defi ned by IFRS, or a measure of liquidity. Other issuers may calculate Core FCF conversion, EBITDA and Core EBITDA differently with respect to the definition used by the Group. 75 Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows in the financial statements. 76 See Note D.20 of the financial statements. 77 This concerns restructuring and similar costs, expens es relating to environmental provisions for historical periods. 145(\u20ac million unless otherwise indicated) Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Operating income/(loss) (EBIT) (12.8) (10.8) (0.5) Depreciation, amortization and imp airment of property, plant and equipment, intangible similar items(1) 3.3 2.1 1.2 Net allocations of reversals of unutilized provisions for environmental risks(1) 3.1 3.8 12.4 Other(1) 2.6 0.0 0.0 Core EBITDA (A) 72.2 67.2 71.7 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 71.5 96.8 34.9 Net change in other current assets and other current liabilities (57.2) (27.7) (13.3) Current taxes 18.3 11.2 15.2 Financial expenses and income (recognized in the cash flow statement in operating activities) 2.0 0.9 2.6 Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (88.6) (88.4) (81.8) Restructuring costs and sim ilar items - inflows/outflows 3.5 6.4 2.3 Expenses relating to environmental provisions - inflows/outflows 11.2 7.6 5.9 Core FCF (B) (39.3) 6.9 FCF conversion (47.8)% (1) Restatements presented in Section 8.1.4 \" Main performance indicators \" of the Prospectus. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Core FCF decreased by \u20ac46.2 million, from \u20ac6.9 million in 2020 to \u20ac(39.3) million for the y ear ended December 31, 2021. The decrease comes mainly from th e change in other current assets and other current liabilities as well as the decrease in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Core FCF conversion fell by 64.7 percentage points, from 10.2% to (54.5) %. As previously explained Section 9.5.1 \" Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities \" of the Prospectus, this decrease is due to the finalization of the Prior Reorganization Transactions in 2021, which negatively impacted net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Core FC F increased by \u20ac41.2 million, up from \u20ac(34.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to \u20ac6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily related to improvement in ne t cash provided by (used in) operating activities as presented in Section 9.5.1 \" Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities \" of the Prospectus. Core FCF conversion improved by 58 .1 percentage points, from (47. 8)% to 10.2%. The increase stems from a decrease in Core EBITDA (see Section 8.2.12 \" Alternative performance indicators relating to results \" of the Prospectus) combined w ith an increase in Core FCF. 1469.5.5 Restated Core FCF conversion The table below provides a reconciliation between th e alternative performance indicators as derived from the consolidated financial statements and th ese same indicators including impacts related to the implementation of the new business model: \u20ac million Historical data 2021 Restatements made Restated data 2021 Sanofi Contract s Secondary packaging Target organizational structure Scope adjustments Other Effects of the legal restructurin g(1) Core EBITDA (A) 72.2 45.5 (1.1) (5.5) (4.2) 3.7 0.0 110.6 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 71.5 67.2 (0.2) (7.5) (4.2) 14.3 56.5 197.8 Net change in other current assets and other current liabilities (57.2) (0.6) 2.7 (4.8) (59.9) Current taxes 18.3 18.3 Financial expenses and income (recognized in the cash flow statement in operating activities) 2.0 2.0 Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (88.6) (88.6) Restructuring costs and similar items - inflows/outflo ws 3.5 3.5 Expenses relating to environmental provisions - inflows/outflo ws 11.2 (7.2) 4.0 Other gains and losses, disputes 0.0 2.8 2.8 Core FCF (B) (39.3) 66.6 (0.2) (4.8) (4.2) 5.1 56.5 FCF Conversion (B/A) (54.5)% 72.1% (1) The restatements of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the lega l restructuring is aimed at neutralizin g the material additional flows directly related to the Prior Reorganization Tran sactions performed in financial year 2021. These flows come m ore specifically from the accounts receivable and accounts payable reflected in th e opening balance sheets of the activities of the EUROAPI comb ination at January 1, 2021, but which were not contributed at the time of the effective cont ributions - for example, the receivables refle cted on the balance sheets for the legal entity \"intra\" sales made between the activ ities of the EUROAPI combinati on and the Sanofi group for which legal flows did not exist before the Prior Reorganization Transactions. As a re sult, in the consolidated financ ial statements at December 3 1, 2021, of the EUROAPI Group, all the receivables and liabilities not contributed were settled in return for the net contribution of the Sanof i shareholders. The restatement is intended to reflect the busine ss of the EUROAPI Group in its target structure. 147The increase in the Core FCF ratio restated in 2021 is due primarily to delays in supplier payments induced by the Prior Reorganization Transactions, as well as the increase in liabilities for non-current assets due to investments made in the last quarter of 2021 (see Section 9.4.2. \" Capital expenditures \" of the Prospectus). \u20ac million Historical data 2020 Restatements made Restated data 2020 Sanofi Contracts Secondary packaging Target organizational structure Scope adjustments Other Core EBITDA (A) 67.2 63.4 (0.3) (15.5) (6.8) (0.3) 107.7 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 96.8 46.8 (1.9) (16.8) (6.8) (1.6) 116.5 Net change in other current assets and other current liabilities (27.7) 0.4 0.0 1.2 1.6 (24.5) Current taxes 11.2 11.2 Financial expenses and income (recognized in the cash flow statement in operating ac tivities) 0.9 0.9 Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (88.4) (88.4) Restructuring costs and similar items - inflows/outflows 6.4 6.4 Expenses relating to environmental provisions - inflows/outflows 7.6 (3.1) 4.5 Other gains and losses, disputes 0.0 0.0 Core FCF (B) 6.9 47.3 (1.9) (15.5) (6.8) (3.1) 26.7 Core FCF Conversion (B/A) 10.2% 24.8% 14810. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 10.1 Sector regulations The pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors for hum an and animal health are highly regulated. National and supranational health authorities have established a broad set of legal requirements, regulations and guidelines to regulate the clinical tr ials and quality standards necessary for the approval of new drugs and for their safety a nd efficiency optimizati on. In particular, these authorities regulate the quality system to be put in place, as well as the de velopment, manufacture, control, distribution and marketing of the products. In general, medicinal product manufacturers must en sure compliance with regulations and standards for products used in the composition of drugs, includi ng the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Activities related to the manufacture, import, export and marketing of APIs are thus subject to rules and controls by the authorities with the u ltimate purpose of ensuring drug quality. Activities related to APIs are generally subject to good manufacturing practices (\"GMP\") and good distribution practices (\"GDP\"). For example, an international GMP standard (ICH Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for the Manufacturing of APIs) has been developed by the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) of Technical Requ irements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, a body created in 1990 and reformed in 2015. Th e ICH also develops guidelines concerning product quality and quality system requirements, based on a scientific consensus among representatives of pharmaceutical regulatory bodies and experts. These gui delines are then implemented by international and local authorities that recognize the ICH. In addition, production sites must be registered with their local health authoriti es, such as, for example, the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products ( Agence Nationale de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 du M\u00e9dicament et des produits de sant\u00e9 -\"ANSM\") in France, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (\"MHRA\") in the United Ki ngdom, and the Italian Medicines Agency ( Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco -\"AIFA\") in Italy, as well as with the international health authorities of other countries in which the products are marketed, such as the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") in the United States or the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency (\"PMDA\") in Japan. The Group's six production sites are registered with their local health authorities, as well as with the FDA and the PMDA, and are audited by these agencies. Finally, e xports and imports of APIs worldwide are also subject to laws, regulations, guidan ce documents and standards issued by supranational, national or local authorities. 10.1.1 European Union (a) The placing of APIs on the market In the European Union, the placing of APIs on the ma rket is not subject to a marketing authorization, unlike medicinal products. However, according to Annex I of European Directive 2001/83/EC (for medicinal products for human use) and Annex I of European Directive 2001/82/EC (for medicinal products for veterinary use), the marketing author ization application for a medicinal product must contain information concerning the API(s) containe d in that medicinal product. For the purposes of providing this information, the manufacturer of an API can choose one of three types of procedures: establish a permanent file on the API (Active Substance Master File (\"ASMF\")), obtain a certificate of compliance with th e European Pharmacopeia (\"CEP\"), or provide the market authorization applicant/holde r with the chemical documentation to allow the file in question to be completed. 149The first two options are preferred by the Group for confidentiality reasons betw een the different parties (marketing authorization holder and API manufacture r) and ease of registration in the case of multiple customers. Creation of a permanent file on the API (ASMF) The ASMF contains information including a detaile d description of the manufacturing process, quality control during manufacturing, and process validation. The ASMF is submitted to the competent health authorities by its holder - the manufacturer of the API - only in support of a market authorization application or a change in the market authoriza tion package, which are themselves submitted by the manufacturer of a medicinal product containing the API. The API manufacture r's submission of the ASMF must therefore be concurrent with the fili ng of the marketing authorization application by the medicinal product's manufacturer with the competent authority. The ASMF consists of a so-called \"closed\" part containing information considered conf idential by the manufacturer of the API, such as information relating to intellectual property or know-how, and accessible only to the competent authorities. Only the \"open\" part of the ASMF is accessible to marketing author ization applicants whose medicinal product contains the same API and must include the information needed by the product's manufacturer. The marketing authorization applicant is fully responsible for the contents of its application file and must have a ll the information necessary to ensure the API's suitability for the needs of its drug, as well as the quality and quality control of the API. Obtaining of a certificate of suitability to the European Pharmacopeia (CEP) The European Directorate for the Quality of Medici nes & HealthCare (\"EDQM\"), an executive division of the Council of Europe, manages and updates the European Pharmacopeia, which is a collection of common standards defining, on the one hand, genera l quality requirements and, on the other hand, specific quality requirements for APIs, known as m onographs. Monographs have been developed for a number of well-established ingredients, including orga nic or inorganic APIs and excipients obtained by a manufacturing process or by extraction. The manufact urer of an API that forms the subject of a monograph in the European Pharmacopeia can apply for a CEP, which is granted, where appropriate, after the review of a detailed application file and samples by the EDQM. The CEP (certificates of suitability to the European Pharmacopeia) guarantees the application of the relevant monographs and makes it possible to verify that the quality of the ingr edient is suitable for use in drugs. In particular, it ensures that all impurities and potential contamina tions associated with the manufacturing process, implemented in accordance with the relevant monograph, are fully controlled by the latter. Provision of complete chemical documentation The third option is for the manufacturer of the API to provide the marketing authorization applicant with the complete chemical documentati on, which the marketing authoriza tion applicant then incorporates directly into its marketing authorization file. In this case, information considered confidential by the manufacturer of the API, such as information rela ting to intellectual property or know-how, is made available to the holder of the marketing authorization. This situation applies in particular to the APIs manufactured by the Company as CDMO for the manufacturer of the drug who intends to fully manage the file on the APIs manufactured for it by the Company. (b) Good manufacturing and distribution practices With regard to the GMP and GDP a pplicable in the European Union, these are defined by the European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\") under the terms of the re levant European directives, then adopted or transposed into the national law of the Member States and implemented by the national competent authorities, such as the ANSM in France. The European GMP is derived from the 2000 ICH Q7 gui de. The objective of the GMP is to ensure an appropriate quality management system and to ensure that APIs meet the quality and purity requirements 150necessary for their use in the manufacture of medici nes or vaccines. They cover all operations of reception of materials, production, packaging, rep ackaging, labeling, re-labeling, quality control, release, storage and distribution of APIs, as well as the associated controls. Manufacturers of medicinal products for human or vete rinary use, and therefore their suppliers of APIs, such as the Group, have the obligation to use only APIs that comply with the GMP, and in the case of medicinal products for human use, also with the GDP. In order to certify their compliance with the GMP, sites may be issued by the competent national authoriti es with a certificate of compliance. All processes for the manufacturing of APIs at the Group's six sites are certified as GMP compliant. Furthermore, sites engaged in the manufacture, impor t and distribution of APIs, such as the Group, are subject to specific obligations regulating their crea tion and their activities, including an authorization issued by the national competent authorities. Thus, in France, these activities carried out by the Company have required prior authorization issued by the Director of the ANSM. The ANSM has the power of inspection and injunction over these sites and may suspe nd or prohibit all or part of their activities in the event of non-compliance with applicable regulations. In addition to regulatory inspections by health authorities, sites involved in the manufacture or distribution of APIs may be subject to contractua l audits organized by customers (manufacturers of drugs containing the APIs), taking into account the obligations imposed on drug manufacturers as described above. This is the case for the Group's sit es, which are regularly audited by its customers. 10.1.2 United Kingdom The regulations described above in relation to the European Union are also applicable in Northern Ireland (Ulster). However, following the United Ki ngdom's exit from the European Union on January 1, 2021, the rest of the United Kingdom (England, Wal es and Scotland) is subject to different regulations from those applicable within the European Union. Still, by way of derogation and until December 31, 2022, the MHRA will recognize market authoriza tions issued by the EMA under the centralized procedure. The ICH Q7 good manufacturing practices are also applicable in the UK. 10.1.3 United States In the United States, a manufacturer of a product deemed to be a \"human drug product\", including an API, may file a Drug Master File (\"DMF\") - also known as a \"Type II DMF\" - with the FDA when this covers only the API. This file contains confiden tial and detailed information about the facilities, processes or components used in the manufacture, c ontrol, processing, packaging and storage of APIs. The filing of a DMF is not mandatory and does not need to be formally approved by the FDA. It will be assessed only when a market authorization application file makes reference to it. As with European packages, this approach is preferred by the Group because it makes it possible to control the confidentiality of production operations with respect to the customer. In line with the European practice, another approach is for the manufacturer of the API to provide the marketing authorization applicant with the chemi cal documentation that the latter will incorporate directly into its pharmaceutical file, for example the Investigational New Drug Application (IND), New Drug Application (NDA) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for generic drugs. The FDA conducts inspections outside the United States on sites that manufacture pharmaceutical products or APIs for export to the United States. For example, the Group's production sites in the European Union and the United Kingdom are subject to regular inspections by representatives of the FDA. In the event of any finding of potential non- compliance with the requireme nts applicable to APIs used in the United States, the FDA's inspectors are like ly to notify the site's violation risks by issuing a \"Form 483\" notice requiring the site's ma nagement to remedy the situation. 151In the United States, the import of APIs is contro lled and can be rejected by Customs and Border Protection, generally after consultation with the competent health author ities, such as the FDA. 10.1.4 Japan In Japan, the PMDA invites manufacturers of APIs to submit a file called a Japanese Drug Master File (\"JMF\"). This is not a mandatory procedure, and the JMF is presented by the PMDA as neither a marketing authorization nor a patent. However, like the ASMF in the European Union and the DMF in the United States, the JMF consists of a \"closed\" and an \"open\" part and is in tended to protect the know- how of the manufacturer of the API when information relating to that ingredient is used for the purposes of a drug marketing authorization application. The filing of a JMF by a foreign manufacturer of an API requires the designation of a responsible person, kn own as an \"in-country caretaker\", living in Japan, who is responsible for relations with the PMDA. W ithin the Group, this role is provided by EUROAPI Japan, a subsidiary of the Company. Given the PMDA' s level of requirement with regard to the form and detail of JMF applications, the pr ocedure can be lengthy and complex. 10.1.5 Other countries Many other countries to which APIs manufactured by the Group are exported, such as China, Russia, Brazil and India, require the creation of files for products used in the composition of drugs. Their national authorities are likely to carry out inspecti ons of sites producing APIs imported into their territory. For example, the Group's production sit es in the European Union and the United Kingdom receive regular visits from representatives of the h ealth authorities of many countries to monitor how the APIs are produced. However, some specific aspects of these countries ' GMP are quite similar to the GMP defined in ICH Q7, allowing some streamlining of the Group's procedures. 10.1.6 Specific aspects related to animal health products APIs for veterinary use are managed in a similar ma nner to APIs for human use. They may give rise to specific inspections by certain authorities. 10.1.7 Specific aspects related to opiates The production, manufacture, transportation, impor t, export, possession, supply, sale, acquisition and use of certain APIs or drugs classified as narcotics or poisonous substances are subject to stricter regulations than other health pr oducts. These specific regulations apply in particular to the opiates manufactured by the Group. In France, the production and distribution of these products are therefore subject to authorization and require specific trace ability and enhanced security conditions. In addition, the marketing of these products is subject to more or less severe restrictions depending on the country. In France, supplies of narcotics for drug manufactur ers can be obtained only from Francopia, a Group company, unless an exception is made by ANSM. Main ly through Francopia, the Group markets opiates (which represented 55.5% of its sales of alkaloids for the year ended December 31, 2021) mainly in France, Japan and Canada, and excluding the United States. Due to the serious risks of dependence that may be caused by the excessive or illegal use of opiates, which are classified as narcotics, complaints ha ve been filed against certain manufacturers or distributors, particularly in the United States (see Section 3.5.1 \" Risks related to product liability \" of the Prospectus). 15210.1.8 Problems related to mutagenic impurities and nitrosamines Since July 2017, the guide \"ICH guideline M7 on assessment and c ontrol of DNA reactive (mutagenic) impurities in pharmaceuticals to limit potential carcinogeni c risk\" is applicable to products marketed by the Group and requires the assessment of impurities in APIs in the event of any major changes to processes or to territorial scope. In this context, this guide requires manufacturers of APIs to assess impurities in relation to the mutagenicity risks inherent in each molecule. Depending on the classification of each molecule, scientific assessments, expert analyses or process developments must be implemented to evaluate the risk and ensure that the presence of mutagenic impurities remains below the acceptable daily limit. Although these requirements are not presently applicable retrospectively to products already on the market, the required expert analyses will be deployed progressively as each API is developed. In 2018, the presence of nitrosamines was detected in a number of APIs and drugs used for the treatment of hypertension, triggering a crisis management situ ation in the pharmaceutical industry. Nitrosamines are classified as probable carcinogens for humans and are tolerated only at very low levels to avoid initiating a risk of cancer. The authorities identified several factors that could be responsible for the presence of nitrosamines, including the chemical process used to produ ce the API, cross-contamination and raw materials. Following this crisis, several nati onal and supranational authorities, such as the EMA, the FDA and the European authorities responsible for medicinal products, asked all holders of a marketing authorization for chemical medicinal prod ucts to carry out, as a precautionary measure, an assessment of the risks linked to the presence of nitrosamines and to formulate a strategy for controlling those risks. Sanofi and the Group conducted a review of the entire portfolio of APIs transferred to the Group between 2018 and 2021. This review made it possi ble to show the absence of any risk for some of the APIs produced by the Group (in particular, the absence of N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosodiethylamine impurities for sartans, such as ir besartan and olmesartan medoxomil) or, for others, to implement action plans to remedy the presence of nitrosamines (systematic expert analysis, optimization of processes under de velopment, submission of corresponding regulatory files to the competent authorities), in particular for rifampicin and rifapentine, for which a process optimization plan is currently being developed by the Group, with the aim of implementing an industrial process in 2022. It is likely that other regulatory te xts will be published in the coming years. 10.2 Fraud and abuse The Group is subject to various regulations on fra ud and abuse. These regulations concern fraudulent acts, such as misappropriation of assets or corruption, no n-compliant behavior in interactions with third parties, including government officials, customer s and suppliers, and inappropriate marketing or promotion practices and conflicts of interest. The Group is thus subject to anti-corruption regulatio ns, such as the Sapin II Law in France, the Bribery Act of 2010 in the United Kingdom or the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") in the United States. The Group is also subject to regulations specifically aimed at the health sector that regulate relations between healthcare companies and health professionals, particularly in relation to the management of conflicts of interest, the transparency of certain benef its granted, and the prohibition of benefits or gifts. In France, for example, as a manufacturer of APIs fo r human use, the Group is subject to the provisions of the French Public Health Code ( Code de la sant\u00e9 publique ) concerning benefits granted by healthcare companies (in particular, Articles L. 1453-1 to L. 1453-14 of the French Public Health Code ( Code de la sant\u00e9 publique )) prohibiting the provision of benefits to health professionals and making any exceptions subject to authorization or declaration rules, as well as an obligation to make public the existence of any agreements or benefits gran ted to a wide range of health professionals. 15310.3 Environmental regulations A number of the Group's activities involve the handling, manufacture, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or dangerous substan ces within the meaning of regulations concerning the protection of the environment, health and safety, as is the case for other companies engaged in similar activities. Consequently, the Group's production activ ities in particular are subject to various environmental regulations defined an d implemented at the European, nati onal or local level, such as the European regulation on the Registration, Evaluatio n, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Classification, Labeling and Packag ing (CLP)/Globally Harmonized System (GHS), SEVESO regulations, IPPC/IED regulations, the Wast e Framework Directive, the Emissions Trading Scheme Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Energy Directive and national taxes on the use of fossil fuels, and various other provisions to combat global warming. Thus, the Group's production sites are subject to various obligations under enviro nmental regulations, such as the regulations relating to classified facilities for the protection of the environment ( Installation Class\u00e9e pour la Protection de l'Environnement (ICPEs)) in France concerning the handling, use, manufacture, reuse and destruction of substances and pollutants, the rehabilitation of old i ndustrial sites or the regulations relating to waste. These regulations impose, among other things, the requi rement to obtain a permit to carry out certain activities, or to notify such activ ities to the competent authorities, and to comply with binding and evolving rules relating to the protection of the envi ronment and to health and safety for the conduct of such activities. The authorities responsible for the e nvironment, health or safety have the power to inspect sites and to impose administrative and/or cr iminal penalties in the event of non-compliance. For example, non-compliant aqueous waste from an industria l site may be subject to a formal notice (as may have been the case at the Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf site) prior to the adoption, where appropriate, of administrative sanctions and criminal proceedings. These regulations may also provide strengthened provisions, particularly with regard to safety, for facilities with a SEVESO rating due to the risks posed to human health and/or the environment by the substances and mixtures used and manufactured in th ese facilities. There are two categories of SEVESO facilities according to the total qua ntity of hazardous materials on s ite: \"high-threshold\" and \"low- threshold\". The Group operates Vertolaye, Frankfurt and facilities in Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf and Brindisi. In France, \"high-threshold\" SEVESO facilities, such as the on e operating in Vertolaye, must therefore have technological risk prevention plans (\"TRPPs\") to organize the cohabitation of the industrial sites at risk and the neighboring areas. The measures prescr ibed by the TRPP, namely, land measures (expropriations, land clearance rights), additional measur es to reduce risk at source at industrial sites (process modification, unit relocation, etc.), work to reinforce exis ting neighboring h ousing in case of technological accidents, or restrictions on future pl anning, are covered by tripartite financing between the State, local authorities and the opera tors of the facilities causing the risk. In addition, under the environmental regulations generally applicable in Europe and particularly in France, Germany and Italy, the operator or former ope rator of activities that have caused contamination of the operated land or surrounding land may reta in responsibility for the existence of such contamination and its potential hea lth or environmental consequen ces. This responsibility, which may last for decades (for example, 30 years from the decl aration of cessation of operations of classified facilities in France), may require the operator or former operator, whether or not it is the owner of the operated land, to undertake, at its own expense, e nvironmental investigations , monitoring measures and/or remediation measures. Moreover, the principl e that the waste producer is responsible for the waste until it is finally disposed of may result in lia bility on the part of the waste producer due to the impact of such waste on land belonging to third parties, including waste generated in the past by activities that are no longer being carried out. Finally, under the European regulations on chemical substances, in particular the REACH regulation, each substance manufactured and/or imported by each Group entity in quantities of more than one ton per year must be registered. This can generate signifi cant costs, particularly in relation to the sharing of 154the necessary data. The assessment carried out by th e European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the information submitted in the context of registrations may result in th e identification of substances of very high concern, thus leading to the adoption of restrictions on use (Annex XVII of the REACH Regulation), or even to prohibitions on the placi ng on the market and/or use of these substances (Annex XIV of the REACH Regulation). Such restri ctions and/or prohibitions could significantly impact the Group's activities and must be carefully monitored and anticipated as early as possible to identify appropriate a lternative substances. 10.4 Regulations on foreign investments in France Certain foreign investments in French companies are subject to prior authorization from the Minister of the Economy when all or a portion of the target's busin ess activity is related to a strategic sector, such as energy, transport, public health, telecommunications , etc. As of the date of the Prospectus, the Group operated certain activities covered by the regulation on foreign investments in France, particularly for public health. Due to the operation of activities, the Company and the Group fall within the scope of the laws and regulations governing foreign investments in France set forth by Articles L. 151-3 and R. 151- 2 et seq. of the French Monetary and Financial Code. Under these provisions, the acquisition by a non-French citizen, a French citizen who does not reside in France, a non-French entity or a French entity contro lled by such persons or entities of control, within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commer cial Code, or of all or a portion of a branch of activity of the Company or one of its French subsidiaries conducted activities enumerated by the aforementioned provisions, is subject to the prio r authorization of the Minister of the Economy. Moreover, the acquisition by an investor that is not a citizen of a member State of the European Union, or of a State that is a party to the agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA), that results, directly or indirectly, in exceeding, alone or in concert, th e threshold of 25% of the voting rights of the Company or of one of its French subsidiaries conducting these activ ities, is subject to this same procedure. Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decree lowe red this threshold to 10% of the voting rights for French companies whose shares are listed for tradi ng on a regulated market. This provision has been extended until December 31, 2022, by Decree 2021-1758 of December 22, 2021. In the context of the prior authorization procedure, the Minister of the Economy is charged with verifying that the conditions of the planned transacti on preserves the national interests; in this respect the Minister may attach one or more conditions to the authorization of such a transaction in order to ensure the continuity of the c oncerned activities, industrial capac ities, research and development capacities or related expertise, or even, on the basis of a motivated decision, refuse such an authorization, particularly if national interests cannot be protected. Any transaction executed in violation of these provisions is nul l and void; it is also subject to financial sanctions, the maximum amount of which is twice the amount of the illegal investment, and to the criminal sanctions set forth in Article 459 of the French Customs Code ( Code des douanes ). 15511. TRENDS 11.1 Business trends A detailed description of the Group's results for th e year ended December 31, 2021 is provided in Chapter 8 \" Operating and financial review \" of the Prospectus. In the current geopolitical context, the Group considers, as of the date of the Prospectus, that the armed conflict in Ukraine could have a non-material impact on its revenues, given its limited exposure to the markets of countries affected by the armed conflict and/or international sanctions in their current configurations. In addition, the Group has used hedgi ng instruments to hedge al most all of its energy purchases in 2022 in order to smooth out prices over time. Furthermore, the Group, which sources one non-pharmaceutical raw material (ethyl acetate) from one supplier located in Ukraine, identified an alternative source of supply and is actively working to set up alterna tive sources of supply for methanol from Russia. Finally, the activities of the representati ve office established by the Group in Russia to market the products of its API Solutions business in Russia are currently being maintained. Although the Company will not experience difficulties in fina ncing its representative office in Russia in the coming months, it is actively working to establish a su stainable financing solution for this representative office in compliance with the applicable sanctions. As of the date of the Prospectus, with the exception of the information provided in section 19.7 \"Significant change in the financial position \" of the Prospectus, the Company is not aware of any material change in the financial performance of th e Group between December 31 , 2021 and the date of the Prospectus. 11.2 Medium-term outlook The objectives and trends discussed below are based on data, assumptions and estimates, including economic outlook, considered reasonable by the Group as of the date of the Prospectus. These trends and these objectives, which are deri ved from the Group's strategic plans, are not provisional data or profit estimates of the Gr oup. The figures, data, assumptions, estimates and objectives presented below may change or be changed unpredictably, depending on developments in the economic, financial, competitive, le gal, regulatory, accounting or ta x environment, among others, or depending on other factors of which the Group may no t be aware as of the date of the Prospectus. Moreover, the occurrence of certain risks described in Chapter 3 \" Risk factors relating to the issuer \" of the Prospectus may have a negative effect on the bus iness, financial position, market situation, results or outlook of the Group and, as a result, call into question its ability to achieve the objectives presented below. In addition, the achievement of these objectives assu mes the success of the Gr oup's strategy described in Section 6.4 \" Strategy and objectives \" of the Prospectus and the implementation of this strategy. As a result, the Group makes no commitment and gi ves no guarantee as to the achievement of the objectives described in this section. Outlook for the Group's activities and financial objectives. The outlook for the Group's activities and financial ob jectives presented below are based on the market trends and outlook described in Section 6.2.2 \" Market dynamics \" of the Prospectus and on the assumptions described in Section 12.1 \" Assumptions\" below. In line with the Group's strategy described in Section 6.4 \" Strategy and objectives \" of the Prospectus, the Group's objectives are to: 156- reach an average annual growth rate in its re venue, on the basis of its restated revenue for financial year 2021, of between 6% and 7% for the 2021-2025 period; - generate approximately 35% of its revenue from its CDMO activities by 2025 due to greater- than-market growth in this segment through 2025; and - reduce the relative weight of Sanofi in the Group' s total revenue with the goal of reducing it to approximately 30% to 35% of its consolidated revenue by 2025, primarily through greater-than- market growth in sales to other customers. In order to boost the Group's cash, a program has b een initiated in order to reduce inventories which will have the effect of lowering inventories to an equi valent of approximately fi ve months of revenue in 2025, but will also have a negative effect on the short-term margin. The Group is also aiming to achieve a Core EBITDA78 margin greater than 20% by 2025 (compared with a restated Core EBITDA margin of 12.3% in 2021), primarily driven by (a) a better absorption of the fixed cost structure of its production costs throu gh increased volumes to customers other than Sanofi, (b) a positive product mix resulting from the increase (i) in its presence in the most differentiated and most complex APIs and (ii) the relative weight of CDMO activities in the Group's total revenue and (c) the optimization of its sales costs with a reduction on the order of 2% per year by 2025. The Group also intends to rely on past and future investments to support its strategy. Over the 2022- 2025 period, the Group intends to invest around \u20ac510 million, of which approx imately 50% is related to performance and growth investments,79 and around \u20ac230 million on the Gr oup's sites in France. The Group is also targeting a ratio of capital expenditu res to revenue of around 10% in 2025. The Group's investment policy in the coming years is discussed in Section 6.8.3 \" Main future investments \" of the Prospectus. In line with the strategy to improve the Group' s cash generation described in Section 6.4.4 \" Improve the Group's cash generation \" of the Prospectus, the Group is also aiming at a 50% to 53% Core FCF conversion ratio80 by 2025. The Group also intends to maintain a net financial debt81/Core EBITDA ratio of less than or equal to a factor of three over the 2022-2025 period. In accordance with the dividend policy presented in Section 19.5 \" Dividend policy \" of the Prospectus, the Company intends to prioritize, in the short and me dium term, reinvestment of the cash flow generated by its activities in order to support its growth strate gy. As a result, the Company does not expect to distribute dividends before 2025 for the year ending December 31, 2024. Subject to potential acquisitions and/or strategic inv estments intended to support its growth strategy, the Company intends to adopt a progressive dividend polic y in the longer term with the objective of a dividend pay-out rate within the range of the rates of its main European peer s currently operating in the CDMO segment. 78 Corresponding to the ratio of Core EBITDA to revenue. 79 As a result, 50% in maintena nce and compliance expenditures 80 As defined in Section 9.5.4 \" Core FCF conversion \" of the Prospectus. 81 Net financial debt corresponding to short and long-term financial debt (including lease liabilities) minus cash and cash equivalents and current financial assets. 15712. PROFIT FORECASTS OR ESTIMATES Forecasts for the year ending December 31, 2022, presented below are based on data, assumptions and estimates that the Group considers to be reasonable as of the date of the Prospectus. These data and assumptions may change or be changed due to uncertainties linked to the economic, financial, accounting, competitive, regulatory and tax environm ent, or depending on other factors of which the Group may be unaware as of the date of the Prospect us. Moreover, the materialization of certain risks described in Chapter 3 \" Risk factors relating to the issuer \" of the Prospectus could have an effect on the activities, financial position, profits or outlook of the Group and, therefore, call into question these forecasts. In addition, the realization of the forecasts assumes the success of the Group's strategy. Therefore, the Group makes no commitment and gives no guarantee as to the realization of the forecasts described in this section. The forecasts presented below, and their underlying assumptions, have been established in accordance with the provisions of delegated regulati on (UE) 2019/980 and the ESMA recommendations on forecasts. 12.1 Assumptions The outlook for the year ending December 31, 2022, has been established on a basis comparable to the historical financial information and in accordance with the accounting methods applied in the Group's consolidated financial statements fo r the year ended December 31, 2021. This outlook is primarily based on the following assump tions for the year ending December 31, 2022: 1. the implementation of EUROAPI's new business m odel resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transactions as described in Section 7.1 \" Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" and in Section 8.1.4(b) \" Restated performance indicators taking into account the new EUROAPI business model resulting from the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus; 2. the continued implementation of the Group' s strategy as described in Section 6.4 \" Strategy and objectives \" of the Prospectus with, in particular: o an acceleration in the growth of the reve nue from its API Solutions business with customers other than Sanofi; o the acceleration of the development of CDMO activities, contributing to a positive product mix on the Group's margins; o an increase in its presence in th e most differentiated and most complex APIs by relying on all of the technological tools and expertise at the Group's disposal; o a decrease in the proportion of revenue with Sanofi in relation to the portion of the 2021 restated revenue, which reflects the new business model over a full year (see Section 8.2 \"Analysis of results for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 \" of the Prospectus); o continued implementation of the plan to improve the Group's industrial performance and the supply-saving plan described in Section 6.4.3 \" Improve operating margin of the Group \" of the Prospectus; 3. In a context of high inflation, the ability of the Group to pass on a significant portion of price increases for raw materials and energy to cu stomers, taking into account the ongoing negotiations with clients other than Sanofi; 158 4. continuation of the program to reduce inventories initiated in 2021, which will have the long- term effect of lowering inventories to industry st andards, but will have a negative effect on the short-term margin; 5. a slight improvement in the sanitary situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which would result in a limited downturn in the demand for cer tain medicines intended for respiratory or bacterial diseases and a change in the market that is greater than the rate of growth observed during this period;82 6. the absence of a significant change in the regulatory and tax envi ronment existing as of the date of the Prospectus; 7. the absence of any major change in the foreign ex change rates of the main countries outside the Eurozone in which the Group ge nerates its revenue compared with those seen during the year ended December 31, 2021; 8. an uneven breakdown of revenue between the firs t and second half of the year ending December 31, 2022, and within each period, with a preponde rance of revenue generated in the second half. 12.2 Group forecasts for the year ending December 31, 2022 On the basis of the assumptions described above, th e Group is targeting for the year ending December 31, 2022, that it will reach: - a consolidated revenue of approximately \u20ac1 billio n, including 25% to 30% in CDMO activities, and a decreased dependence on Sanofi in terms of percentage of revenue; - a Core EBITDA margin equal to or greater than 14%. The Group is also aiming at a ratio of capital expenditures83 to revenue of around 12% in 2022. In accordance with the dividend po licy described in Section 19.5 \" Dividend policy \" of the Prospectus, the Company does not plan to distribute dividends for the year ended December 31, 2021. 12.3 Report of one of the statutory auditors on the profit forecast (Core EBITDA margin ) for the year ending December 31, 2022 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED] 82 The annual growth rate fell to 2% between 2019 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Section 6.4 \"Strategy and objectives\" of the Prospectus). 83 As defined in Section 9.4.2 \"Capital expenditures \" of the Prospectus. 159 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED] 16013.

The following performance criteri a are planned for financial year 2022, with the weightings indicated below (each objective may be exceeded up to a maximum of 150%): o Amount of revenue (20%). o Core EBITDA margin (30%) expressed as a percentage of revenue. o Core Free Cash Flow conversion (Core FCF Conversion) (20%) expressed as a percentage. o Accomplishment of the strategic roadmap , which may include qualitative and precisely measurable criteria (20%); and o ESG criteria, including the ESG roadmap to be approved and a diversity criterion for the Group's extended management team co mprising the Executive Committee and key executives in key positions of the Company, for the year 2022 (10%). A long-term incentive plan (aligned with the one th at will be set up for the Company's principal executives), the estimated value of which will be capped at 130% of the fixed remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer. This incentive will be composed of both stock options and performance shares. The stock options and the performance shares granted under these plans will be granted (i) subject to the condition of m eeting performance criteria over a period of three consecutive years and (ii) subject to a continuo us employment condition also over a period of three consecutive years. The allocation and conditi ons of these instruments shall be decided at a later date (see below). Thus, the stock options and the performance shares will be vested in the Chief Executive Officer, provided that his term of office is still in effect on the vesting date; benefits in kind consisting of the use of a Company vehicle or a car allowance; eligibility for an \" Article 82 \" (French General Tax Code) suppl emental collective pension plan, which also benefits the other executives whose pos itions are classified as \"Executive Level 1 or 2\" in the grid in force within the Group.

A grant of performance shares of the Company for a face value of up to seven times the amount invested is being considered. The performance shares 178will be fully vested only at the end of a three- year period, and will be subject to performance conditions in line with the objectives indicated by the Company in the Prospectus . They will be transferable only at the end of a one-year lock-up period following vesting. The allocation and conditions of these performance shares shall be decided at a later date (see below). The performance conditions for th e performance shares and stock options comprising the long-term incentive plan will be determined pr ecisely by the Board of Directors, which is to meet no later than on the day of the transformation of the Comp any into a French public limited company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme ) with a Board of Directors. It is contemplated th at these conditions will include, with respect to the performance shares, revenue growth, Core EBITDA margin and inventory coverage84, each counting for one third. The revenue growth criterion will be measured by reference to the Group's target for the 2021-2024 period; the Core EBITDA margin will have to reach the average of the three Core EBITDA margins for the 2022-2024 period and reach the Core EBITDA margin for the financial year 2024; and the inventory coverage criterion will have to reach th e Group's target at the end of the last year of the 2022-2024 period. Performance shares will vest according to the rate of achievement of the criteria, at 35% if two of the three criteria are met at the target level; 70% if all three criteria are met at the target level; and 100% if two criteria are met at 110% of the Group's targets and the third criterion is met at the target level. It is intended that stock opti ons granted to the Chief Executive Officer include a performance condition linked to re venue growth, measured against the Group's target for the 2021-2024 period. The stock options will vest according to the ra te of achievement of the criterion, at 33% if the criterion is achieved at the target level over the peri od; 66% if the criterion is achieved at 110% over the period; and 100% if the internal revenue growth budget is achieved over the period. After the admission of the Company's shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, the Board of Directors of the Company will decide on the terms and conditions for the allocation of performance shares and stock options. The performance conditions of the performance shares granted under the \"co-investment\" plan will be determined precisely by the Board of Directors, which will meet no later than on the day of the transformation of the Company into a French public limited company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme ) with a Board of Directors. It is intended that these conditions include internal performance conditions for 75% (growth in revenue, Core EBITDA margin and inve ntory coverage (as defined above), each counting for 25%) and a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) condition compar ed to a panel of companies and an index, thus remunerating the profitability for th e shareholder for 25%. With regard to internal performance conditions, the revenue growth criterion will be measured against the Group's target for the 2021-2024 period; the Core EBITDA margin will ha ve to reach the average of the three Core EBITDA margins for the 2022-2024 period and reach th e Core EBITDA margin for financial year 2024; and the inventory coverage criterion w ill have to reach the Group's target at the end of the last year of the 2022-2024 period. Performance sh ares will vest according to the rate of achievement of the criteria, at 35% if two of the three criteria are met at target level; 70% if all three criteria are met at target level; and 100% if all three criteria are met at the inte rnal budget level. The TSR performance condition will be based on two indicators (median of a panel of selected companies during the 2022-2023 period, comparison with a French index during the 2022- 2024 period). The perform ance shares will vest according to the rate of achievement of the criteria, at 50% in case of achievement of the French index at 110% and if EUROAPI is ranked behind the median of the panel of selected companies; and 100% in case of achievement of the index at 110% and if EUROAPI is at the median of the panel of selected companies, subject to certain adju stments in the event of a change of control of the Company. The right to the performance shares and stock options will be lost if the Chief Executive Officer is dismissed for serious misconduct or gross negligence, or for reasons attributable to performance before the expiration of the vesting period set at three consecutive years. 84 Inventory coverage corresponds to inventory value (as reported in the Group's consolidated financial statements) divided by the Group's consolidated revenue multiplied by 365. 179In order to protect the Group's legitimate interests, as well as its development in a highly specialized sector, the Chief Executive Officer contract, approved by decision of the sole shareholder of the Company on September 30, 2021, states that the Ch ief Executive Officer would be subject to a non- compete undertaking, whose geographic perimeter is in line with that of the Company's activities, for a period of 12 months in the event of resignation, or si x months in the event of dismissal (which may be renewed once), from his effective departure from the Co mpany for any reason. In this respect, the Chief Executive Officer would receive, for the duration of and subject to compliance with the non-compete undertaking, a gross monthly fixed indemnity equal to 75% of his annual fi xed remuneration received over the past 12 months preceding th e end of his term of office (fixe d remuneration and annual target bonus). In addition, the Chief Executive Officer is entitled to an indemnity that would be due in the event of dismissal (except in the event of gross negligence or serious misconduct) by decision of the Board of Directors, the gross amount of which would be equi valent to 12 months' remuneration calculated on the basis of the average of the previous 12 months' re muneration (including the fixed salary and the actual amount of the last known bonus). In the event of forced departure following a merger or demerger of the company, a change of control, a significant change in the company's strategy or a profound disagreement with the Board of Di rectors, the Chief Executive Office r's severance payment is subject to performance conditions applicable during the te rm of office. These performance conditions include the amount of revenue, Core EBITDA margin and Core FCF Conversion, which will be subject to six criteria, over a two-year observation period (three criteria per year based on the Group's financial objectives (see Section 11.2 \" Medium-term outlook \" of the Prospectus)), except for year 2023, which would only take into account the y ear 2022 for the observation period. No later than on the day of the Company's transf ormation into a French public limited company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme ) with a Board of Directors, the Board of Di rectors will determine the performance conditions applicable to this indemnity and provide the necessary clarifications to comply with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, which the Company intends to refer to as of the admission to trading of its shares on the regulated mark et of Euronext Paris. All of these provisions will be specified in the remuneration policy, which sha ll be subject to the approval of the shareholders' meeting in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code. In any event, the sum of the non-compete and dismissal indemnities may not exceed 24 months' remuneration, and no dismissal indemnity would be due if the bene ficiary was able to exercise his or her right to retirement within 12 months from termination of office.

Recurring annual long-term incentive plan After the admission of the Company's shares to tradi ng on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, the Company's Board of Directors will be asked to impl ement a long-term incentive plan for the principal executives and key managers of the Group. The goal of this policy is to increase loyalty and mobilize approximately 120 to 150 of the Group's executiv es and high-potential employees for the success of its ambitious medium- and long-term objectives. On March 30, 2022, the sole shareholder of the Company, which approved the transformation of the Company into a French public limited company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme ) with a Board of Directors, subject to the approval of the Distribution in Kind by Sanofi's comb ined annual shareholders' meeting, to be held on May 3, 2022, decided, with effect as of the admission of the Company's shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, to reserve an amount of (i) 3% of the share capital for a period of 26 months for free share allocation plans, for which th e maximum share attributable to corporate officers may not exceed 0.4% of the capital, (ii) 2% of the cap ital, for a period of 26 m onths, for the stock options reserved for Group employees and corporate officers, th e maximum share of which is attributable to corporate officers may not exceed 50% of all options granted by the Board of Directors pursuant to said authorization. The financial delegations approved by the sole sh areholder of the Company on March 30, 2022, with effect as of the admission to trading of the Company' s shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, are set out in Section 20.1.1 \" Subscribed and authorized but unissued share capital \" of the Prospectus.

For ot her beneficiaries, the plan will consist only of performance shares. The exercise period for the stock options will be nine years from the date they are granted.

No later than on the day of the Co mpany's transformation into a French public limited 184company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme ) with a Board of Directors, the Boar d of Directors of the Company will be asked to determine precisely the pe rformance conditions of the stock options granted in connection with these plans.

Under these plans, the performance shares will be grante d (i) subject to the condition that the beneficiary meets performance criteria over a period of three consecu tive years, and (ii) provided that the beneficiary remains within the Group over a period of three c onsecutive years. Nevertheless, exceptions to the presence requirement may be provided in the terms of the plans that will be adopted by the Board of Directors deciding on their allocation. It is planned that these criteria will include pertinent and stringent operational and financial performance criteria designed to reflect the main challenges of the strategy expected by the Company's shareholders, measured over three consecutive years (growth in revenue, Core EBITDA margin and inventory coverage (as defined above), each counting for one third). The revenue growth criterion will be me asured by reference to the Group's target for the 2021-2024 period; the Core EBITDA margin will have to reach the av erage of the three Core EBITDA margins for the 2022-2024 period and reach the Core EBITDA margin for financial year 2024; and the inventory coverage criterion will have to reach the Group's targ et by the end of the last year of the 2022-2024 period.

Given the applicable legislation in oth er countries in which the Group operates, the corresponding data is not available in these countries or is calculated using different methods. Consequently, the Group considers France, where the larges t number of people are employed, constitutes a homogeneous and reliable basis for t he presentation of this data. 16.1.3 Working conditions and human resources policy The Group attaches particular importance to social issu es concerning, in particular, health and safety at work, employee engagement and quality of life, the qua lity of the social dialog and promoting diversity and integration into the local social fabric.

Th is scheme also allows eligible employees to participate in any employee stock ownership operations offered by the Company. Foreign companies linked to the Company may also participate, under the conditions provided for by the PEG. In France, the Group plans to set up: a time savings account; a collective company retirement savings ( plan d'\u00e9pargne retraite d'entreprise collectif , or PERCOL), which allows eligible employees to invest including payments from the equity- interest agreement and the incentiv e agreement for their retirement. This scheme offers eligible employees the possibility of benefiting from certain ta x and social benefits in return for a lock- up period ending at retirement. 16.3.4 Employee stock ownership plans The Company's intention is to establish employee st ock ownership plans related to its contemplated listing and, in this regard, the Company plans to im plement, after the admission to trading of its shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris: a restricted share plan for all eligible em ployees of the Group, (i) in France for a value equivalent to \u20ac6,000 per beneficiary, subject to a continuous employment condition during a one-year vesting period, followed by a one-year holding period, and (ii) in certain countries of its scope outside France for a value equivalent to \u20ac3,000 per beneficiary, subject to a continuous employment condition during a two-year vesti ng period, with no holding period.

The terms of the elected members of the employee de legation to the Social and Economic Committees (Comit\u00e9 Social et Economique (CSE)) of establishments and of the trade union representatives have been maintained pursuant to Article L. 2314-35 of the French Labor Code. In the absence of the transfer of the entire head office within Sanofi Chimie, the terms of the elected members and trade union representatives on the CSE of that establishment, w hose employment contracts were transferred to EUROAPI France and to the Company, were not conti nued. As a result, elections for the members of the CSE head office were held in November 2021. Additions were then made to employee representation on the central CSE. Within the perimeter of EUROAPI France and the Company, the employees are thus represented at different levels by: representative trade unions; elected and/or mandated employee representativ es at site level and at central level; employee representative bodies at site level and at central level, the Social and Economic Committees (CSE); and various mandatory or optional committees, such as the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee (CSSCT) and committees on gende r equality or professional training. As of the date of the Prospectus, the capital of the Company is wholly owned by Sanofi Aventis Participations, a company wholly , directly and indirectly owne d by Sanofi. In accordance with applicable European regulations, a European works council has been in place at Sanofi since 2005. It is made up of 80 representatives (40 members and 40 alte rnate members) who meet twice a year. Its select committee meets twice a year. A Eu ropean works council shall be established for the Group following the admission to trading of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. Each country has representative bodi es in accordance with applicable law and maintains a permanent and satisfactory social dialog. 195EUROAPI France considers it has constructive and peaceful relations with the representative trade union organizations with in the unit and with the elected officials and representatives. The nine agreements negotiated since March 2021 have been signed by the trade union organizations, with seven signed unanimously. The meetings of the empl oyee representative bodies that have been held at the sites and at the central leve l since the transfer of company liabilities have been conducted in a respectful and balanced manner. 19617. MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS 17.1 Shareholders holding more than 5% of the capital on the date of the Prospectus As of the date of the Prospectus, the Company is established as a French simp lified joint-stock company (soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions simplifi\u00e9e ) held indirectly by Sanofi.

Sanofi group is a global pharmaceutical company invo lved in the research, development and marketing of therapeutic solutions focused on the needs of its patients. The Group is the outcome of numerous mergers and acquisitions, particularly the merger of Sanofi and Synth\u00e9labo in 1999, the acquisition of Aventis in 2004 (from the merger of Hoechst and the Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Rorer group) and the acquisition of Genzyme in 2011.

The Company, Sanofi and EPIC Bpifrance, acting on be half of the French State under the French Tech Souverainet\u00e9 protocol of December 11, 2020, as am ended (the \"Investor\"), have entered into an investment agreement (the \"Invest ment Agreement\") pursuant to whic h the Investor has undertaken to acquire from Sanofi a number of shares representing 12% of the share capital of the Company as of the date of payment of the Distribution in Kind, i.e., May 10, 2022, at a price equal to the lowest of (i) the volume-weighted average price of the Company's sh ares over a period of 30 consecutive trading days from the date of admission of the Company's shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, i.e., May 6, 2022, and (ii) \u20ac150 million (the \"Investment\").

Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, th e Investor will have the right to propose the appointment of (i) two members of the Board of Directors of the Company, including one member of the nominations and remuneration committee, as long as the Investor holds at least 10% of the share capital of the Company, or (ii) one member of the Board of Directors who could also be a member of the nominations and remuneration committee, as long as the Investor holds at least 5% and less than 10% of the share capital of the Company. By a decision dated March 30, 2022, the sole shareholder of the Company decided, subject to the condition preced ent of the admission of the Company's shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, (i) to appoint Bpifrance Investissement, represented by Benjamin Paternot as member of the Board of Directors and member of the nominations and remuneration committee of the Company, and (ii) th e appointment of Mr. Jean-Christophe Dantonel as 197member of the Board of Directors of the Company appointed upon proposal of the Investor (see Section 13.1 \" Information about the Board of Directors and the Executive Management \" of the Prospectus). Sanofi has undertaken to vote in favor of the appoi ntment and/or re-appointment of the candidates proposed by the Investor for a period of 12 years as from the decision of the sole shareholder of the Company deciding on the appointment of Bpifran ce Investissement and Mr. Jean-Christophe Dantonel as members of the Board of Directors of the Comp any, or March 30, 2022, unless the Investor ceases to hold a number of shares representing at least 5% of the Company's capital and Sanofi ceases to hold EUROAPI shares. In addition, the Investor has undert aken to vote in favor of the appointment of a representative of Sanofi (or one of its successors) to the Company's Board of Directors and audit committee, subject to Sanofi's co mpliance with its voting commitment described above and Sanofi's holding of a number of shares representing at least 5% of the Company's share capital. In addition, under the terms of the Investment Agre ement, the Investor has undertaken in particular: ensure that its representatives on the Company's Bo ard of Directors (the \"Representatives\") are not appointed to or hold positions on the supervisory or governan ce bodies of any entity (or its affiliates) whose business competes with that of the Company, unless (i) such appointment has been approved by the Company or (ii) in th e event that a Representative is a legal entity arrangements are in place that prevent the exch ange of commercially sensitive information relating to the Company and its business between the permanent representative of such legal entity Representative (or its employees, officer s or agents with commercially sensitive information relating to the Company and its busin ess) and the employees, officers or agents of such legal entity Representative who directly supervise and manage an investment of the Investor in a competing company; and adopt strict compliance rules and conflict of interest procedures to prevent the Investor (including any person or entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Investor) from using any information provided to the Investor as a result of its representation on the Board of Directors in a manner that woul d be detrimental to the Company or any entity controlled by the Company. In addition, under the terms of the Investment Agreem ent, (i) the Investor has undertaken to retain the EUROAPI shares purchased for a period of 24 months from the date of settlement and delivery of the EUROAPI shares purchased under the Investment, i.e., on June 17, 2022, and (ii) Sanofi (including its affiliates) has undertaken to retain the EUROAP I shares held from the date of payment of the Distribution in Kind for a period of 24 months fo llowing the date of settlement and delivery of the EUROAPI shares acquired under the Investment, in both cases subject to certain usual exceptions. Sanofi and the Investor are not acting in concert with in the meaning of article L. 233-10 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) with respect to the Company. 17.2 Control of the Company As of the date of the Prospectus, the Co mpany is indirectly controlled by Sanofi. Following the Distribution in Kind (see Section 22.1 \" Terms and conditions of the Distribution in Kind \" of the Prospectus) and the Investment, the Sanofi group will no longer control the Company within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercia l Code. However, it expects to continue holding, through Sanofi Aventis Participations, approximate ly 30% of the capital and voting rights of the Company and will as such be in a position to exert significant influence on the Group's strategic decisions. 198However, it is recalled that the Company intends to appoint six independent directors with respect to the criteria defined by the AFEP-MEDEF Code as fr om the admission of the Company's shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris a nd that Sanofi, through its subsidiary Sanofi Aventis Participations will have only one representative out of the ten members of the Company's Board of Directors as from the admission of the Company's shar es to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. The Company will set up an audit committee, a nominations and compensation committee and an ESG committee comprised mostly of independent directors. 17.3 Agreements likely to result in a change of control As of the date of the Prospectus, there is no agreemen t that, if implemented, could lead to a change of control of the Company. 19918.

This insurance is subject to the customary exclusi ons for such insurance policies providing coverage for environmental liabiliti es. This policy, for which the premium is fully handled by Sanofi, will be transferred to the Co mpany in connection with the initial listing of the Company's shares. 201In accordance with the provisions of the Master Ca rve-Out Agreement, the Company and Sanofi have appointed a committee in charge of monitoring th e Prior Reorganization Transactions set out by the Master Carve-Out Agreement and a committee in ch arge of monitoring the commercial relations between the parties. The two committees will meet over a period of three years and five years, respectively, starting from the Loss of Control by Sanofi. The composition of each of these committees, which includes an equal number of representatives of the Company and Sanofi, reflects a balanced governance between the parties. Each of these commit tees shall provide an escal ation mechanism in the event of persistent disagreements. The Master Carve Out Agreement is subject to French law. Any disput e arising out of or in connection with the Master Carve Out Agr eement shall be submitted to arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. Locally, the Local Transfer Agreements In each of the countries concerned, the Company' s dedicated subsidiary and a Sanofi group company have signed local transfer agreements (the \"Local Transfer Agreements\") setting out the terms for carrying out the transfer of the assets and liability de dicated to the Transferre d Activity in accordance with applicable local laws. Depending on the countri es, assets and liabilities transfers have been carried out through demergers, sale of business assets (or local equivalent) and/or sales of isolated assets and liabilities or securities sales (see Section 7.1 \" Description of Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus). In addition to these two levels of agreement, the Prior Reorganization Transactions also required the execution of certain sales of isolated assets a nd liabilities, as described in Section 7.1.1 \" Prior Reorganization Transactions implem ented in France, Hungary, Germany, Italy, the United States, Japan, China, Slovakia and Russia \" of the Prospectus. 18.2 Agreements signed by the Sano fi group and third parties for the execution of the Prior Reorganization Transactions Agreements entered into with BASF The industrial site located in Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbe uf and transferred to EU ROAPI was shared between Sanofi and BASF in accordance with a series of agreem ents concluded between the parties comprising, in particular, a separation agreement dated February 13, 2004 (as amended), a sale agreement concerning the land and buildings used for the wastewater tr eatment plant on November 29, 2013 (as amended), and services agreements. To guarantee the smooth operation of the Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf site, especially the supply of certain services essential to the industrial activity, the transfer of assets and liabilities relating to the Transferred Activity in Fr ance required concluding on September 28, 2021, a tripartite agreement between BASF, Sanofi Chimie and EUROAPI France, as well as a commercial lease on September 1, 2021, and a master service agr eement on October 1, 2021, providing in particular for the renewal or redrafting of the services agreem ents for general services, utilities and the waste treatment plant, effective as of January 1, 2022. As of October 1, 2021, (i) Sanofi is required to indemnify the Company and its subsidiaries for any BASF claim based on environmental issues or occupational illnesses as recalled in Section 18.1 \"Agreements signed by the Sanofi group and the Gr oup for the execution of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" above and (ii) the Company will be require d to indemnify Sanofi or its subsidiaries against any other loss relating to th e obligations or commitments with respect to the services described above and that may be incumbent on them due to the agreements with BASF. 202Agreements relating to the Frankfurt site Furthermore, the Prior Reorganization Transactions required the split and/or the duplication of some agreements concluded, between, on the one hand , Sanofi Aventis Deutschland GmbH (\"SADG\"), the entity that operated the portion of the Transferred Activity in Germany, and on the other hand, Infraserv GmbH & Co. H\u00f6chst KG (\"ISH\") and its affiliates (together with ISH, the \"ISH Group\"). The Transferred Activity is operated in the H\u00f6chst indus trial park at Frankfurt am Main in Germany. The ISH Group owns all the land on which the H\u00f6chst industrial park is built, which it leases to the companies located in the industrial park, and pr ovides various services to these companies. SADG is currently a shareholder of the ISH Group with a 30% equity stake. SADG and the ISH Group have entered into various ag reements regarding real-estate leasing and the supply of services by the ISH Group, particularly ser vices relating to buildings, utilities and networks, IT, environmental, logistics and other services. Most of these agreements concerned both the Transferred Activity and the business retained in the scope of SADG. Consequently, on June 30, 2021, SADG and the ISH Group concluded several agreements with the goal of dividing and/or duplicating their agreements in order to create a sep arate set of agreements dedicated to the Transferred Activity and another set dedicated to the business retained by SADG. As part of the Prior Reorganization Transactions carried out in Germany, the agreemen ts relating to the Transferred Activity were transferred to EUROAPI Germany GmbH, a subsidiary of the Company, with effect from November 1, 2021. The main provisions of the agreements with the ISH Group in the context of the agreements relating to the Transferred Activity in Germany are presented below: Some agreements provide for a right to adjust prices for the benefit of the ISH Group, in the event of change in the costs of the ISH Group resulting from a change of legislation, case law or administrative practice or in case of unexpected costs linked to the capital expenditures borne by the ISH Group. The new lease (the \"Lease Agreement\"), pursuan t to which EUROAPI Germany GmbH leases the majority of its buildings contains a clause providing for the right for ISH to request a temporary or permanent price adjustment, for anc illary costs, in an appropriate amount and after certain imposed procedures, in the event that ot her companies located in the industrial park are unable to pay their share of costs due to insolvency. The ISH Group has requested a guarantee concer ning the obligations provided for by the Lease Agreement in connection with the Transferred Ac tivity, particularly the obligation to demolish the buildings when the lease expires. The Co mpany, as the parent company of EUROAPI Germany GmbH, has granted a guarantee to cove r these requests. In 2026, EUROAPI Germany GmbH will have to supply a bank guarantee, to supplement the guarantee granted by the Company, in the event that so me of the Company's financial performance indicators fall short of the thresholds agreed by the parties on that date. The guarantee granted by the Company and the bank guarantee are limited to \u20ac28.5 million, subject to the adjustment in case of the addition or withdrawal of the Lease Agreement for buildings , which is subject to a demolition obligation. Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, EUROAPI Germany GmbH is required to pay for certain restoration costs in the event of the construction of new bu ildings by or for EUROAPI Germany GmbH (as for example, the excavation of contaminated soils) or demolition of existing buildings. Furthermore, EUROAPI Germ any GmbH is required, pursuant to th e Lease Agreement, to bear 2.19% of the costs relating to protection measures agai nst environmental damages for the entire H\u00f6chst industrial park. This obligation can be increased to 2.29% in the event the Company exercises its option to lease an additional building from ISH (the G 839 pilot plant). 203In this context, SADG and EUROAPI Germany GmbH, have agreed, as part of the demerger agreement entered into at the end of the Prior Reorgani zation Transactions, that all liabilities including environmental ones related to the Lease Agreement will definitely be the responsibility of the Company. Furthermore, SADG is required to bear certain envi ronmental protection costs related to the Offheim, A\u00dflar and Lindenholzhausen external landfills, whic h were previously used for SADG activities. According to the terms of the demerger agreement, SADG has transferred a share of these obligations to EUROAPI Germany GmbH, within the limit of 5. 97% of the respective total annual costs for the Offheim landfill and 14.24% of the respective tota l annual costs for the A\u00dflar and Lindenholzhausen landfills. The environmental liabilities that may exist, with r espect to other commitments and predating the Prior Reorganization Transactions, ha ve been retained by SADG. 18.3 Agreements entered into with the Sanofi gr oup and the Group as part of the Prior Reorganization Transactions for the future conduct of business The Group's related parties include the Company' s shareholders, non-consolidated subsidiaries, affiliated companies (equity-accounted investees) and entities on which the various Group executives have significant influence. For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales to th e Group's customers other than Sanofi and sales to Sanofi accounted, respectively, for 54.4% and 45.6% of the Group's consolidated revenue. By 2025, the Group expects sales to Sanofi to account for 30% to 35% of its consolidated revenue. The figures detailing the relations with these relate d parties can be found in Note D.22 of the consolidated financial statements for the years e nded December 31, 2021, 2 020 and 2019, presented in Section 19.1 \" Historical financial information \" of the Prospectus. In addition to the completion of the Prior Reorganization Tr ansactions (see Section 7.1 \" Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus), it was ag reed that the Company and its subsidiaries continue to maintain a set of contr actual commercial relations with the Sanofi group from which they originate. In the context of the Prior Reorganization Transactions carried out in 2021, the Company and its subsidiaries have t hus concluded with Sanofi and some of its subsidiaries agreements concerning: The manufacture and supply of a number of AP Is, intermediates and other substances. The distribution of some APIs. The provision of services. The development of APIs or intermediates. The Company and its subsidiaries have also concluded with Sanofi and so me of its subsidiaries license agreements concerning intellectual property rights, as well as other ad-hoc agreements, particularly leases, in order to allow the parti es to continue their activities and ensu re the master agreements remain in effect. The conclusion of these agreements is the outcome of independent negotia tions between the Group's teams and the Sanofi group teams. 20418.3.1 Manufacturing and supply agreements for certain APIs The global manufacturing and supply agreement In addition to the completion of the Prior Reorganization Tr ansactions (see Section 7.1 \" Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus), it was ag reed that the Sanofi group will continue to benefit from the services supplied by th e Company and its subsid iaries under the new terms concluded as part of the transactions . To this end, Sanofi Winthrop Industrie, a Sanofi group company, and EUROAPI France, each one acting in its own name a nd in the name and on behalf of their affiliates, signed on October 1, 2021, a manufacturing and supp ly agreement for APIs, intermediates and other substances (the \"Global Manufacturing and Supply Agr eement\") at fixed prices determined on the basis of market prices and sustainable for both parties, s ubject to the modulation mechanisms of the pricing policy described below, expiring five years after the Loss of Control of the Company by Sanofi. The Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, as amende d on March 1, 2022, with effect as of February 25, 2022 (with the exception of certain provisions effective as of January 1, 2022), covers the manufacture and/or supply by the Co mpany of 86 APIs and/or intermed iates and/or substances required to manufacture the medication marketed by the Sanof i group or manufactured by Sanofi on behalf of its customers. The intellectual property rights relating to APIs, intermediates and/or other substances covered by the Global Manufacturing and Supply Ag reement and those required for their manufacture are held by the Company and its subsidiaries, with th e exception of some cases in which they are held by the Sanofi group. The parties shall notify their intention to renew the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement at least two years before the end of said agreement, and as from this notification, to negotiate in good faith the terms and cond itions of the renewal of the agreement. Pursuant to the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, the Sanofi group shall exclusively source from the Group, on an established list of territories, for its requirements for APIs and/or intermediates and/or other substances covered by the Global Manufacturing and Suppl y Agreement, with the exception of certain products listed exhaustivel y and subject to certain exceptions related to legal constraints, the Group's production capacities and the usual exceptions for such agreements. The exclusive sourcing obligation, which covers 42 APIs a nd/or intermediates and/or other s ubstances, will be suspended in the event of foreseeable delay in th e delivery of products for a du ration comprised between one to three months with respect to the delivery date agreed upon by the parties or in the event of repeated incidents relating to product quality and consecutive to an identical cause. At Sanofi's discretion, this obligation may be terminated, product by product, in the event of delay in the delivery of products over a period exceeding three months (or in case of repeat ed delays over a shorter period), in case of annual customer level below 50% or non-compliance of the pharmaceutical products manufactured by Sanofi with the applicable quality standards, and to the exte nt where the latter is attributable to the Group; or in order to comply with the European regulation applicable to vertical agreements. The monthly customer service level is the percentage of the numbe r of orders considered compliant (in terms of on- time delivery, quantity and product lifespan) out of the total number of orders received during a given month. In the event that the customer service level on an annual basis falls below a threshold defined by the parties based on the year of performance of the contract, but that exceeds 50%, the Company may be required to pay Sanofi a penalty. The amount of the penalty shall be a mutually agreed percentage of the amount of non-conforming orders that deviate fro m the expected target (capped at 10%). The Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement also provides for the Group's obligation to exclusively supply the Sanofi group, limited to the 11 products listed a nd only in certain countries, with the exclusion of any other customer. The terms of the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement include a price-volume corridor corresponding to an annual tiered compensation m echanism between the par ties covering up and down fluctuations, beyond a threshold agreed upon by the parties, between the target revenue and the actual revenue related to Sanofi's purchases for a number of APIs. The price-volume corridor mechanism which is applicable between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2026, includes (i) a global compensation mechanism, i.e., compensation due by one party to the other if the difference between global actual revenue and reference gl obal sales is outside the globally applicable corridor for the year 205in question, the magnitude of which shall increase in increments one time over the 2022-2026 period, and (ii) a subsidiary compensation mechanism for th e benefit of the Group calculated at the level of each of the production sites, i.e., compensation will be due by Sanofi if the difference between the site's actual revenue and the site's reference sales falls out side the applicable site-wide corridor (for the first three years only), during the 2022-2024 period, the magnitude of which shall increase in increments one time. Reference sales refer to the quantity of sales corresponding to Sanofi's expected purchases, defined by product covered by the pr ice-volume corridor mechanism, by production site and by year. Actual revenue refers to, for a given year, the amount (in euros) of products for which Sanofi has received firm orders under the terms of the Gl obal Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. Actual revenue includes the amount of prod ucts ordered by Sanofi within the limits of the capacity reservation clause described below, in the even t that such order is refused by the Company. Any amounts paid under the Group's performance clause or compensation mechan ism in the event of a si gnificant increase in the price of certain raw materials or the evolution of en ergy costs (as described belo w) are excluded in the determination of the am ount of actual revenue. The APIs and/or intermediates a nd/or other substances covered by th e exclusive sourcing obligation and the price-volume corridor previously described repr esented 52% of the Group's sales with Sanofi, on a restated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the Group's objective regarding Sanofi's relative weight in total Group re venue by 2025 is presente d in Section 11.2 \" Medium-term outlook \" of the Prospectus. The Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement also contains a capacity reservation clause in the Group's production sites, for the benefit of Sanof i, corresponding to an annual minimum quantity of five APIs or manufacturing intermediates (THTP, Fexofenadine, Metamizol Na, Cyclopentane and Irbesartan) excluded from the exclusive sourcing ob ligation and the price-volu me corridor, at fixed prices determined by the parties. In the event that Sanofi orders a quantity below the quantity agreed between the parties under the reservation clause, pe r API and for a given year, a compensation would be owed by Sanofi. Correlatively, the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement includes a maximum capacity clause beyond which the Company' s supply obligation to Sanofi shall cease. In the event that Sanofi orders a quantity exceeding th e minimum quantity and lower than the maximum capacity but the Company does not deliver the said quantity, the Company could be compelled to pay Sanofi a penalty as specified in the contract. The Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement also includes several commitments from Sanofi in the event of sale by Sanofi to a third party of a fi nished product including an API manufactured by the Group, from a production site or a business segment con cerning such finished product. In such event, the parties have undertaken to ensure that the buye r accepts to continue the relationship with the Group, as a manufacturer, according to the terms set out in the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. As an exception, in certain cases, Sanofi may, at its discretion, act as an intermediary between the Group and the purchaser of the finished product, the production site or a business segment. If some sold finished products are covered by the capacity reservation clau se described above, the rights and obligations of the Sanofi group will be transferred to the buyer, subject to certain exceptions. Pursuant to the Global Manufacturing and Supply Ag reement, Sanofi will have to compensate the Group in case of a significant increase in the price of certain key raw materials and solvents used to manufacture APIs and intermediates for Sanofi. This mechanism is applicable starting from 2022 and until the end of 2026. Pursuant to the latter, the Group will be entitled, in the event of an increase ranging between 20% and 50% of the price of certain raw materials and solvents with respect to their reference price set in 2020, to an indemnification, the amount of wh ich will depend on this increase. In the event of an increase of over 50% of the price of these raw materials or solvents, the parties have agreed to negotiate a new indemnification mechanism in good faith. 206The Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, as ame nded, contains a reciprocal sharing of energy costs (gas, electricity and steam) in relation to refe rence prices determined by the parties, for Sanofi's portion of purchases. Under the terms of this agreem ent, in the event of a difference, calculated by energy source and at the level of each of the Group's s ites, between (i) the energy costs for a given year for the concerned energy source and (ii) the Group' s supply costs calculated on the basis of reference prices determined by the parties, a compensation will be due by energy source and by Group site for Sanofi's portion of purchases, by Sanofi in the event of additional costs for EUROAPI and by EUROAPI in the event of a gain on the price of energy by Group site and by energy source. In addition, in the event of an increase of more than 10% in the quantiti es of energy used, the Group will be compensated only up to the percentage increase in product sales to Sa nofi. This energy cost sharing mechanism is applicable from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2026. The Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement contains a performance clause corresponding to the annual retrocession by the Company, as from 2022 and un til the end of 2026, for a portion of the fixed and variable cost savings made by the Company on the cost of APIs, intermediates and other substances sold to Sanofi, the amount of which has been previo usly agreed upon by the parties on the basis of the actual business volume and the savings relating to th e industrial performance and raw materials supply, subject to certain adjustments. The amount of the an nual retrocession, which shall be a low single-digit percentage of total annual revenue made with the Sanofi group, will be insignificant and increase steadily through 2026. The Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement does not provide for early redemption and/or cancellation in the event of a change of control of the Company. It is governed by French law. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement shall be submitted to arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. Reverse Manufacturing and Supply Agreements In connection with the completion of the Prior Re organization Transactions, a number of agreements were also entered into, effective on October 1, 2021. Under these agreements, some Sanofi group companies will have to supply certain services rela ting to the manufacture of APIs to the Group's companies (the \" Reverse Manufacturing and Supply Agreements \"). They include: A first agreement, as amended, in force until December 31, 2023, and renewable by mutual consent, pursuant to which Sanofi Chimie, acting as sub-contractor, will continue to manufacture a number of APIs belonging to a comm ercial partner of the Group, and will supply EUROAPI France. A second agreement, in force until December 31, 2024, pursuant to which Sanofi Chimie, as the sub-contractor, will be in charge of the ma nufacture of B12 derivative salts on behalf of EUROAPI France. The contract stipulates that the technology transfer free of charge to the Group must be completed no later than at the end of the contract. A third agreement, in force for five years afte r the Loss of Control of the Company by Sanofi, and renewable by mutual consent, pursuant to which Sanofi Chimie, as the sub-contractor, will continue to manufacture a number of APIs on behalf of Francopia. Special agreement between the Group and the Sanof i group related to the packaging of pharmaceutical products In addition to the Prior Reorganization Transacti ons, EUROAPI UK and Genzym e Europe BV, a Sanofi subsidiary, each one acting in its name and in the name of its subsidiaries, reached an agreement pursuant to which EUROAPI UK (and/or each of its con cerned subsidiaries), acting as a Sanofi group sub- contractor, shall have to package, control and release Sanofi group pharmaceutical products. This 207agreement, as amended on Februa ry 28, 2022, became effective on January 1, 2022, for a period of five years starting from the Loss of Control of the Company by Sanofi. 18.3.2 Special agreements between the Group and the Sanofi group relating to the development of APIs EUROAPI France and Sanofi-Aventis Research and Deve lopment (each one acting in its name and in the name of its affiliates) conc luded on October 1, 2021, a master agreement for development and GMP manufacturing services (the \"Master Agreement for Development and GMP Manufacturing Services\") pursuant to which each of the parties acting, as appropriate, as either service provider or beneficiary of the services relating to the development and/or im provement of the manufacturing processes of certain APIs or intermediates. Furthermore, EUROAPI Fr ance entered into a similar development agreement with the Opella Healthcare Group SA S (subsidiary of the Sanofi group' s general public health business). As part of these agreements, the Group is developi ng new chemical entities in Sanofi's R&D portfolio, including a Tolebrutiniban intermediate currently in Phase 3 for multiple sclerosis, the peripheral chain and ligand of Tusamitamab ravtansine, an antibody- drug conjugate currently in Phase 3 in non-small cell lung cancer, or the development of a cationic lipid for certain messenger RNA vaccines being developed by Sanofi Pasteur. In accordance with these ag reements, the parties can also enter into special agreements to define the specific rules concerning in particular capital expenditures, the intellectual property rights of the parties, order and/or ma nufacture projections and commitments for certain molecule volumes or prices. These agreements are conc luded for an indefinite period, with each party having a right to terminate it at any time subject to compliance with a three-month notice period. The Master Agreement for Development and GM P Manufacturing Services and the development agreement entered into with Opella Healthcare Group SAS provide that each present and future molecule development/manufacturing project on behalf of Sanofi or Opella Healthcare Group SAS under these contracts will be the subject of a specific application contract setting out the precise terms of the project. It is specified that Sanofi and Opella Healthcar e Group SAS will have the opportunity, assessed for each application contract, to terminate any specific app lication contract for the development/manufacture of a molecule taken in the context of these agreements, in the event of a takeover of more than 50% of the Company by a third party company that itself develo ps or sells a molecule or a competing product of the molecule developed/manufactured by the Group on behalf of Sanofi or Opella Healthcare Group SAS. The parties may waive this principle or specify the notion of competitor, application contract by application contract and molecule by molecule. 18.3.3 Distribution agreements for certain APIs EUROAPI France and Sanofi Chimie (each acting in its name and in the name of its affiliates) reached a distribution agreement for APIs belonging to th e Sanofi group (the \"Distribution Agreement\"), effective as of October 1, 2021, for a period of five years starting from the Loss of Control of the Company by Sanofi and renewable by mutual consent. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, as amended on February 25, 2022, and with effect as of its execution date, the Company undertakes to distribute 22 APIs, including Clopidogrel, antihistami nes (promethazine and alimenazine) and insulin, as a non-exclusive retailer for Sanofi. In accordance with the Distributi on Agreement, the prices at which EUROAPI France purchases the APIs are determined by the parties and are fixed for the duration of the agreement, except for two products. The Distribution Agreement mainly covers the distribution by the Group of APIs in Europe and depending on the releva nt products, certain other countries and territories, mainly the United States, Japan, S outh Korea, Russia and India. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and during the initial term of this agreement, Sanofi has undertaken, in the name and on behalf of its affilia tes, not to establish a dedicated in-house commercial organization aimed at promoting the sale of APIs and not to conclude any new global distribution agreement with a third party, whic h could in each of these cases direc tly compete with the distribution by the Group of APIs covered by the Distribution Agr eement, provided that some exceptions related to (i) the direct sale of APIs manufactured by the Sanof i group, in compliance with the European regulation 208applicable in vertical agreements; (ii) compliance with existing Sanofi group contractual obligations to third parties (particularly partners or license holders) not transferred to the Group or the renewal of the latter; and (iii) the conclusion or completion by Sanofi of certain transactions, such as mergers, acquisitions or sales, directly or indirectly related to APIs. Furthermore, EUROAPI France and Sanofi Aventis Si ngapore, each acting in its name and on behalf of its affiliates, have signed a distribution agreem ent pursuant to which Sanofi Aventis Singapore will distribute and sell in South Korea some APIs manufac tured by EUROAPI France and its affiliates. The distribution agreement, which became effective on Nove mber 1, 2021, is entered into for five years starting from the Loss of Control of the Company by Sa nofi. This agreement is not exclusive, except for the API Glymepiride. 18.3.4 Service supply agreements At the same time as the completion of the Prior Re organization Transactions and the carve-out of the Transferred Activity (see Section 7.1 \" Description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions \" of the Prospectus), Sanofi and the Company agreed that it would be necessary for each of them to continue benefiting, following the Prior Reorganization Tran sactions, from a number of services that the other party or its group used to provide it before the Pr ior Reorganization Transactions. In this respect, Sanofi and the Company or some of their affiliates have en tered into (i) transitional services agreements and (ii) long-term services agreements. Transitional services agreements Sanofi and the Company (acting in their own name a nd in the name and on beha lf of their affiliates) have concluded, with effect from October 1, 2021, two transitional services agreements (the \"Transitional Services Agreements\"). One under which Sanofi or its affiliates provide (s) services to the Group, including services related to IT and digital solutions, microbiolog ical analysis, operation of climate-controlled rooms for sample storage, health, safety and environmental compliance, management and accounting. Another under which the Group provides services to Sanofi or its affiliates and in particular services related to raw materials handling and mana gement, water analysis and the analysis of nitrosamine samples (ICH M7). Each of the two Transitional Services Agreements w ill end at the expiration of the last statement of works completed in accordance with its terms, at the end of a three-year period, subject to the extension of a statement of works by the parties beyond that date. Services Agreements Sanofi and the Company, directly or through their a ffiliates, have concluded the following main services agreements (the \"Services Agreements\"). (i). Two agreements concluded for a period of fi ve years, effective on November 1, 2021, between EUROAPI France and Sanofi Chimie , on the one hand, and EUROAPI Germany GmbH and Sanofi, on the other hand, and rela ting to the reciprocal supply, storage and distribution of the reference standards related to the APIs or intermediates and required for the production of dosages concerning the APIs and the finished drug products containing these APIs. 209(ii). An agreement with effect from November 1, 2021, to December 31, 2025, and concerning the supply by Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to EUROAPI Germany GmbH of logistics services relating to certain activities carried out at the Frankfurt industrial sites.

A non-exclusive license between EUROAPI Hungary and Sanofi specifically concerning the API Irbesartan, pursuant to which Sanofi will grant EUROAPI Hungary a right of use to the intellectual property rights relating to Irbesartan, in consideration for royalties (at a mid-single digit percentage (middle of range) of total annua l revenue made with customers other than the Sanofi group) and solely for the purpose of allo wing EUROAPI Hungary or its affiliates to directly or indirectly manufacture, market, sell and/or distribute the corresponding API manufactured at the Ujpest site in Hungary. A non-exclusive and free license between the Co mpany and Sanofi regarding some know-how not exclusively related to the transferred activity but used in connection th ereto (as specified in the license agreement), pursuant to which Sanofi will grant the Company and its subsidiaries a right to use such know-how in connecti on with its present or future activities. As part of the admission to trading of the Company' s shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, it is planned that, as from the admission of the Compa ny's shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, the Group's companies shall cease to use the name \"Sanofi\", subject to grace periods in order to cover certain specific situations. 21018.4 Other relationships with related parties 18.4.1 Tax agreements As of the date of the Prospectus, the Company and its Subsidiaries in France belong to the Sanofi SA tax consolidation group and have concluded with the latter a tax c onsolidation agreement governing the contribution of the Company and its French subsid iaries to the various overall taxes for which Sanofi SA is the sole taxpayer as the head of the group. Th e Company's proposed initial listing on the regulated market of Euronext Paris will result in removing the Company and its relevant subsidiaries from the Sanofi SA tax consolidation with retroactive effect as of January 1, 2022. As a result, the existing tax consolidation agreement shall be terminated. The Company and its subsidiaries belonging to the Sanofi SA tax group will conclude, after th e Company's initial listing, a tax consolidation exit plan, which will have substantially the same terms as the draft instru ment appended to the Master Carve-Out Agreement, for the purpose of specifying the consequences of the exit and planning the reciprocal relations resulting therefrom between Sanofi SA and the exiting compani es. This agreement will mainly provide that (i) Sanofi SA will retain the burden of re integrations related to the exit of the Company and its subsidiaries from the tax group, and (ii) that the exiting comp anies will bear the consequences of any proposed adjustments to their results for the period during which they were members of the tax group under the same conditions as if they had not been integrated (no adjustments or major tax disputes have been identified as of the date of the Prospectus). The tax consolidation exit agreement will also govern the conditions for making advance tax pa yments on the companies and add itional contributions payable in 2022. As from January 1, 2023, a tax consolidation gr oup will be created between the Company and its subsidiaries in France for which it will hold at least 95% of the capital. The creation of this group will lead to the conclusion of tax consolidation agreem ents between the Company and each of the member companies of this integration group to settle the c ontribution of the subsidiari es to the overall tax for which the Company will become the sole taxpa yer as the new head company of the group. 18.5 Special reports of the statutory auditors on regulated agreements for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019 The Company was incorporated on November 10, 2 020. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company was incorporated as a simplified joint-stock company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions simplifi\u00e9e ) and was wholly-owned by Sanofi and therefor e exempt from the requirement to provide a special report by the statutory auditors on regulated agreements for those years. 21119.

(b) For 2021, this amount corresponds to the situation vis-\u00e0- vis the controlling entity up to and including the completion date of the Prior Reorganization Transactions (see Note A.3.3.). 218Notes to the financial statements Introduction The Sanofi group, a global healthcare leader, intends to proceed with an initial public offering (IPO) on Euronext Paris of part of its activities involving the development, manufacturing, commercialization and distribution of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), focused primarily on sales of API to third parties outside the Sanofi group. The proposed IPO, scheduled to take place in the firs t half of 2022 subject to market conditions, aims to create a standalone business developing, manufacturing, commercializing and distributing API to serve the pharmaceutical industry. This new group (hereinafter \"EUROAPI\") comprises (i ) six specialist API manufacturing sites in five European countries (France, Germany, UK, Italy and Hungary); (ii) a number of development platforms, the two largest of which are housed at the sites in Hungary and Germany; ( iii) a commercial network responsible for worldwide distribution and commercia lization of a portfolio of approximately 200 active pharmaceutical ingredients; and (iv) development a nd business management team s responsible for those activities within Sanofi. Those activities - historically carried on by various Sanofi group subsidiaries, some of which carry on activities outside the scope of the IPO - were separated from the rest of Sanofi's activities and combined within a standalone legal structure on completion of a series of legal reorganizations (the \"Prior Reorganization Transactions\") carried out by Sanofi, the controlling entity. Subsequent to the Prior Reorganization Transactions, which had been completed in full as of December 31, 2021, the EUROAPI group (the \"G roup\") is constituted of EUROAPI, a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions simplifi\u00e9e (a simplified form of limited liability company) w ith its registered office at 15 rue Traversi\u00e8re, 75012 Paris, France, and of subsidiaries owned by EUROAPI. The consolidated financial statements of EUROAP I for the years ended D ecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 have been prepared in connection with the pr oposed admission of EUROAPI shares to trading on the Euronext Paris regulated market. The next section describes the basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, including the acc ounting conventions applied (Note A.3.). A. Basis of preparation of the financial statements A.1. International financial reporting standards (IFRS) The consolidated financial statements have been pr epared in compliance with international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the Euro pean Union as of December 31, 2021. The term \"IFRS\" refers collectively to international acc ounting and financial reporting standards (IASs and IFRSs) and to interpretations of the interpreta tions committees (SIC and IFRIC) with mandatory application as of December 31, 2021. The consolidated financial statements for the y ears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were closed off by EUROAPI on February 8, 2022. The amounts shown in the consolidated financial st atements are presented in millions of euros unless otherwise indicated. A.2. Prior Reorganization Transactions carried out during 2021 The EUROAPI group of businesses, comprising the EU ROAPI activities historically carried on by and housed within dedicated and non-dedicated subsidiari es controlled by Sanofi, was subject to a legal reorganization in 2021 in order to prepare for th e proposed admission of EUROAPI shares for trading on the Euronext Paris regulated market. 219That legal reorganization mainly took the form of transfers of shares and/or assets relating to substantially all of the assets and liabilities associat ed with EUROAPI activities to the legal entities of the newly-constituted group. Subsequent to the completion of those transactions , as of December 31, 2021 EUROAPI owned all of the subsidiaries constituting the EUROAPI group. The scope of consolidation of the EUROAPI group is presented in Note F. The reorganization constitutes a business combinati ons under common control within the meaning of IFRS 3. In the absence of any specific IFRS pronouncemen ts on accounting for transactions between entities under common control, EUROAPI opted to account for su ch transactions on the basis of the historical carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities transferred in the reorganization. For details of the combinations of entitie s under common control, refer to Note G. Consequently, those transactions had no effect on continuity of control over the EUROAPI activities with reference to IFRS 10, control having historically been exercised by Sanofi. Given those circumstances, the effects of those transactions between entities under common control are reflected retrospectively in the EUROAPI consolidated financ ial statements, as if the legal reorganization had taken place on January 1, 2019. In connection with the Prior Reorganization Tran sactions, Sanofi and EUROAPI signed a Master Carve Out Agreement effective October 1, 2021, setting out the general principles and arrangements for completion of the Prior Reorganization Transactions su ch as (i) determination of the scope of the Sanofi group's API development, manufacturing, commerciali zation and distribution activities included in the carve out and transferred to the EUROAPI group; ( ii) the assets and liabiliti es transferred, and any specific arrangements applicable to such transfers; (iii) rules governing indemnification between the parties; and (iv) undertakings between th e parties to co-operate (see Note C). Under the terms of the Master Carv e Out Agreement, certain assets and liabilities that were allocated to the EUROAPI group in advance of the Prior Reorgani zation Transactions and presented in the historical financial information were not c ontributed by the controlling entity . In the EUROAPI consolidated financial statements, the reorganization was in some cases reflected by contribu tions and distributions of equity. Consequently, these transactions with th e parent entity have been treated as transactions between shareholders; the non-transferred assets and lia bilities were deemed to have been netted off on completion of the Prior Reorganization Transactions and reflected in equity. A.3. Historical financial information A.3.1. First-time preparation of financial information under IFRS As part of the process of preparing for the IPO, combined financial statements for the years ended December 2020 and 2019 have already been prepared for this scope. Those combined financial statements were closed off by EUROAPI on December 15, 2021. The financial statements of EUROAPI for the year s ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were its first financial statements to have been prepared under IFRS. They were prepared in accordance with IFRS 1 (First-time Adoption of Internationa l Financial Reporting Standards). The principal positions adopted by EUROAPI for those financial statements were: - Assets and liabilities attributable to EUROAPI we re measured at their historical carrying amount as derived from the Sanofi financial statements, under the option permitted in paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1. - Consequently, the assets and liabilities of EUROAP I were measured on the basis of Sanofi's date of transition to IFRS (January 1, 2005) before adjustments made for the consolidation procedures of the Sanofi group, in particular adjustments arising from the application of IFRS 3 (Business 220Combinations) to legal entities included in th e scope of combination (such as fair value adjustments to identifiable assets and liabilities an d the recognition of goodwill). In the absence of any changes in scope during the years presented and ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (see Notes D.1. and G), no adju sting entries were identified as a result of applying that option. The same applies to the period prior to January 1, 2019. - Cumulative currency translation differences account ed for in reserves in the opening statement of financial position were deemed to be zero, under the option permitted in paragraph D13(a) of IFRS 1. The financial statements were prepared without taking into account events after the end of the aforementioned reporting periods that might affect the estimates and judgement s made by management during the periods presented, in accordance with IAS 10 (Events After the Reporting Period). Intercompany transactions between EUROAPI group en tities other than share-b ased transactions were eliminated, while transactions between the EU ROAPI group and the Sanofi group were reported as related party transactions. The consolidated financial statements include allocat ed indirect costs, mainly comprising administrative and general expenses incurred by Sanofi for the be nefit of EUROAPI activities prior to the legal reorganizations of 2021. The accounting policies described below have been applied consistently for all periods presented, including in the opening financial position as of January 1, 2019. A.3.2. Basis of preparation of the statement of comprehensive income Previously to the Prior Reorganization Transactions , past transaction flows which related to EUROAPI activities, and which constitute transactions for legal purposes recorded in the Sanofi financial statements, were attributed directly to the EUROAP I group in the consolidated financial statements. In some specific circumstances, the EUROAPI statem ents of comprehensive income reflect accounting conventions applied in the absence of past transactio n flows, or where it was not possible to attribute transactions directly to EUROAPI. The principles of combination applied in the EUR OAPI statement of comprehe nsive income in such circumstances are described and presented below. Revenue from EUROAPI activities generated with the Sanofi group Revenue from EUROAPI activities, generated by sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured by EUROAPI industrial sites for incor poration into medicines commercialized by the Sanofi group, also includes the following transactions: Intra-legal-entity sales between activities in the EUROAPI combination and the Sanofi group Transactions carried out within a single legal entity between (i) industrial sites within the EUROAPI scope of combination and (ii) Sanofi pharmaceutical sites do not constitute a transaction for legal purposes. However, such transactions have been iden tified and recorded as deemed transactions between EUROAPI and the Sanofi group in the EUROAP I statement of comprehensive income. Such transactions are measured at the transfer pri ce used by the Sanofi group for similar transactions as of the date of the transaction, in accordance with the currently applicable transfer pricing policy. Distribution by EUROAPI to third parties of active ingredients manufactured by Sanofi Sales transactions between Sanofi group entities are measure d at the historical internal transfer price, in accordance with the transfer pricing policy. The operating profit accruing to EUROAPI entities involved in transactions between Sanofi group entities is determ ined by reference to the risks and responsibilities assumed within the Sanofi group. Consequently, revenue derived from the distribution to other 221customers of active ingredients manufactured by the Sanofi group includes internal redistributions of profits between Sanofi group entities, so as to reflect the level of consider ation arising from the distribution activities carried on by EUROAPI within the Sanofi group. Cost of sales of products purchased from Sanofi Purchases of products manufactured by Sanofi and sold by EUROAPI EUROAPI's cost of goods sold reflects the historical cost of sales as recognized in the Sanofi group financial statements. The purchase cost of active ingredients manufactured by Sanofi and commercialized by EUROAPI is the historical Sanofi group internal transfer pr ice. In cases where the historical Sanofi transfer price is determined so as to give consideration for the roles of both manufacturer and intellectual property rights holder, the historical transfer price has been allocated such that the cost of goods sold reflects the distribu tion margin granted as consideration for EUROAPI's distribution activities. Purchases of services between EUROAPI group activities and Sanofi carried out within the same legal entity The cost of goods sold reflected in the EUROAPI statement of comprehensiv e income represents the historical cost recognized in the Sanofi financial stat ements, which takes account of the cost of activities outsourced to Sanofi within a single legal entity. Such transactions are measured at the transfer pr ice used by the Sanofi group as of the date of the transaction. Other operating expenses In order to reflect the total historical cost of EUROAPI activities, Sanofi resources and infrastructure shared with EUROAPI have been allocated b ased on the use made of them by EUROAPI. The principles used for such allocations were designe d to reflect the nature of the underlying expenses, so as to ensure they were relevant and consisten tly applied for all periods presented. Consequently, allocation principles were determined for each func tion involved. For example, full time equivalent (FTE) allocated hours per Sanofi employee whose ser vice benefits EUROAPI activities was determined to be an appropriate basis for allocating the costs of the Sanofi group's global support functions. Allocation formulae based on business activity or size , such as net sales, purchases, value added (for industrial sites) or total assets, were used for that purpose. Such allocations relate primarily to the following global support functions: - industrial support activities such as Health, Safety & Environment (HSE), global quality, and industrial excellence; - costs incurred on REACH regulatory compliance incurred in the period; - other support functions (such as legal affairs, finance, information systems, communications, human resources and facilities management), and expenses related to customer relationship management, order processing, and procurement; - insurance and risk coverage programs including property and loss of profits, public liability, product liability, inventory and goods-in-tran sit cover, and environmental risks; and - centralized cash pooling, including netting arrange ments and hedging of foreign exchange risk. Social security charges incurred by Sanofi legal en tities that contribute to EUROAPI activities were allocated using allocation formulae based on sal es, industrial value added or FTE hours worked, consistently with the allocation fo rmulae applied to the underlying costs. Such costs are reported in the line item Administrative and general expenses in the income statement. 222Because the spin-out costs associat ed with the initial public offering of EUROAPI activities are to be borne by the vendor, they do not impact the consolid ated financial statements of the EUROAPI group for any of the periods presented. Employee compensation and payroll-related charges EUROAPI personnel costs mainly comprise costs of the employees transferred to EUROAPI. These include: - salaries and bonuses (including social security charges) and other long-term post-employment benefits, as reflected in Sanofi's payroll systems; - expenses related to equity-based compensation pl ans, determined by reference to the existing equity-based compensation plans awarded by Sanofi to employees belonging to EUROAPI activities and deemed to be EUROAPI employees within the meaning of IFRS 2 (Share-Based Payment), given that the EUROAPI group is not constituted as a separate legal group; and - statutory and voluntary profit-sharing schemes. The payroll contribution for non-transferred Sa nofi employees whose service benefits EUROAPI activities is included within the total costs of centr al support functions incurred by the Sanofi group and allocated to EUROAPI using the principl es described in the previous section. The financial statements include the current and non-current portions of empl oyee-related liabilities for EUROAPI employees. A liability has been recognized in the statement of financial position for contributions in respect of Sanofi employees not transf erred to EUROAPI (see Notes A.3.3. and D.22.). Income tax expense and liabilities Current and deferred taxes have been determined as if the companie s and activities within the EUROAPI scope of combination constituted separate taxable entities. The accounting principles applied to current and de ferred taxation are described in the section on the basis of preparation of the statement of financial position (see Note A.3.3.). Although the approach used to determine current a nd deferred tax expense (or gain) is appropriate for the purposes of preparing historical financial statem ents before the Prior Reorganization Transactions, it is a purely indicative measure of what the income tax expense (or gain) of the EUROAPI group would have been had the Group been cons tituted of separate taxable entities. A.3.3. Basis of preparation of the statement of financial position The financial statements present assets and liabilities di rectly attributable to the EUROAPI group, plus assets and liabilities derived from related party transactions. The principal conventions used for allocations in the EUROAPI statement of financial position are described below. Goodwill Because no acquisitions within the scope of IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) have occurred within the EUROAPI scope of consolidation, no goodwill is reported in the st atement of financial position. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities Non-cancellable operating leases attributed to EUROAPI comprise: 223- leases relating to industrial buildings, plant and eq uipment, and industrial installations contracted (i) by Sanofi subsidiaries included in the comb ination, for which th e right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability have been allocated pr oportionately to the por tion of the overall lease attributable to EUROAPI and (ii) by legal entiti es wholly included in the scope of combination, for which the right-of-use asset and lease liability have been reflected at their historical carrying amount as recorded in the financial statem ents of the entity in question; and - leases of office space contracted with the Sa nofi group in cases where EUROAPI benefits from the use of Sanofi infrastructure (in particular, the office premises used by EUROAPI activities), for which the portions of the right-of-use asset a nd lease liability attributable to EUROAPI are presented in the EUROAPI financial statements. Accounts payable Accounts payable (other than those involving related pa rties, see Note D.22.) are directly attributed to EUROAPI where the amounts payable relate to (i ) products falling within the scope of EUROAPI activities (including materials used in the ma nufacture of active ingredients commercialized by EUROAPI) or (ii) capital expenditure on capacity improvements at EUROAPI industrial sites. Where it is not possible to attribute accounts payable di rectly on the basis described above, a historical liability has been allocated based on accounts payable as recognized in the Sanofi consolidated balance sheet, using allocation formulae consistent with tho se used for the underlying expenditure or purchases of materials, taking account of the historical paym ent terms observed for total purchases over the period. Equity and financing EUROAPI's share capital reflects the retrospective re cognition of the Prior Reorganization Transactions as of January 1, 2019 (see Note D.21.). The effects of the Prior Reorganization Transactions are recorded in equity, which reflects contributions and distri butions (repayments) deemed to have been made between equity holders of EUROAP I and equity holders of Sanofi. Changes in equity arise from (i) comprehensive income for the peri od; (ii) dividends paid by legal entities within the scope of combination (see Note F.); the value of services obtained from employees under equity-based compensation plans (see Note B.19.); and net contributions from equity holders of the Sanofi group, reflecting cash flows relating to EUR OAPI activities carried on by Sanofi as an equity holder (see Note B.9.) previously to th e \"Prior Reorganization Transactions\". There are no non-controlling interests, so all equity is attributable to the equity holders of EUROAPI. Long-term borrowings EUROAPI is financed on the currently applicable terms and conditions of the Sanofi cash pooling agreement, and hence has no long-term debt to be re flected in its statement of financial position for the periods presented. Short-term borrowings, cash and cash equivalents As is the case for long-term borrowings, EUROAPI has no short-term borrowings, other than positions vis-\u00e0-vis Sanofi under the terms of the cash pooling agreement. The components of Cash and cash equivalents shown in the statement of financial position and the statement of cash flows reflect the cash held by the EUROAPI group, which had no cash equivalents during any of the periods presented. 224Deferred taxes and tax liabilities Current and deferred income tax expenses, and tax r eceivables and payables, have been determined in accordance with the principles describ ed above for the preparation of the statement of comprehensive income (see Note A.3.2.). Deferred tax assets arising from tax losses available for carry-forward attributable to the spun-out activities are determined on a similar basis, and treat ed as equity distributions to the Sanofi taxable entities that house those activities and are entitled to the tax relief. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized where temporary differences arise between the carrying amount and taxable base of EUROPAI's assets and liab ilities, in accordance with the principles specified in IAS 12 (see Note B.17.). Deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases, or from tax losses available for carry-forward, are recognized if their recovery is regarded as probable. Deferred tax assets arising from tax loss carry-forwar ds generated by EUROAPI activities housed within Sanofi subsidiaries that are required to file tax retu rns or that belong to a tax group have only been recognized if they constituted part of a contribution fr om Sanofi; otherwise, they are reflected in equity as contributions from (or distributions to) equity holders of Sanofi. Tax receivables and liabilities genera ted by transferred activities that ar e not required to submit separate tax returns have been recognized in the financial statements in the periods during which they were generated and are deemed to have been distributed or transferred to the taxable entities of the Sanofi group in line with the tax payment schedule applying to each entity. The equity of EUROAPI reflects the corresponding im pact of the movements described above, in line with the description provided above in the \"Equ ity and financing\" section of the present note. Tax payments made by legal entities within the sc ope of combination that exclusively carry on EUROAPI activities are presented within cash flows from operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Tax receivables and tax liabilities are presented within the line items Other non-current assets , Other current assets , Other non-current liabilities and Other current liabilities in the EUROAPI statement of financial position. The impacts of deferred taxes on EUROAPI's statement of financial position are presented in Note D.4. A.3.4. Related party transactions Transactions with entities over which Sanofi exercises control or significant influence or with joint ventures, which are customarily accounted for as intrag roup transactions and eliminated as part of the consolidation procedures applied for the purposes of preparing the Sanofi consolidated financial statements, have been treated as related party transac tions to the extent that they are not intragroup transactions within the EUROAPI scope of combinati on. Such transactions are reported as related party transactions in the EUROAPI consolidated financia l statements, in accordance with IAS 24 (Related Party Disclosures) (see Note D.22.). Transactions between related parties (EUROAPI and Sanofi) comprise the following types of transaction: - sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured by EUROAPI where Sanofi is the customer; - purchases of active pharmaceutical ingredient s manufactured by Sanofi and distributed by EUROAPI; - purchases of manufacturing and development services from Sanofi's pharmaceutical development platforms; and 225- other purchases of general services necessary for the conduct of EUROAPI operations, and corresponding to personnel costs incurred by Sanofi entities on behalf of EUROAPI. In addition to short-term current accounts with Sa nofi, the EUROAPI statement of financial position also includes the following positions with related parties: Accounts receivable and other current receivables wi th related parties (see Notes D.6. and D.22.) - accounts receivable resulting from commercial transactions entered into with Sanofi group companies, representing the last two months of sales in line with historical payment terms applied within the Sanofi group; and - other current receivables resulting from services provided by EUROAPI to the Sanofi group, estimated on the basis of internal paymen t terms applied within the Sanofi group. Accounts payable and other current liabilities with related parties (see Notes D.12. and D.22.) - accounts payable, representing liabilities aris ing on active ingredients supplied by Sanofi manufacturing facilities and commercialized by EU ROAPI, and reflecting internal payment terms applied within the Sanofi group; - liabilities related to shared central services and ot her liabilities, estimated on the basis of internal payment terms applied within the Sanofi group; and - other liabilities relating to (i) personnel costs a nd social security charges incurred by Sanofi on behalf of EUROAPI in respect of employees not in tended to be transferred (see Note D.22.), and (ii) income taxes of entities that were not separ ate legal entities as of the end of the reporting period. As specified in the section on equity (Note A.3.3.), pa yments in respect of related party transactions that pre-dated the Prior Reorganization Transactions are ultimately reflected in cash flows from financing activities within the statement of cash flows, and recognized within the equity of the EUROAPI group as net contributions from equity holde rs of Sanofi to the EUROAPI group. Information about the compensation of ke y executives is provided in Note D.22. A.4. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19, confirmed as a pandemic by the World H ealth Organization on March 11, 2020, led to a global health crisis. EUROAPI estimates that the impact of this major crisis on its financial performance was immaterial for the periods presented (year s ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019). In accordance with IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets), the EUROAPI group conducts impairment tests on the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets allocated to each cash generating unit, including assets not yet brought into service, if an indication of impairment is identified (see Notes B.6., D.2.1. and D.3.). EUROAPI has not recognized any impairment losses that are directly attributable to COVID- 19 in respect of the periods presented. Cash collections continued in line with normal co mmercial timings and conditions (see Note D.6.). As of December 31, 2020, EUROAPI estimated the value of its accounts receivable using the expected loss method (see Note B.7.3.). Nothing was identified that would indicate a material increase in expected credit risk, especially as regards EUROAPI's principal customers (see Note D.25.3.). The EUROAPI group will continue to review its estimates and assumptions in light of the evolving public health situation, and management's assessment of the related uncertainties. A.5. Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements under IF RS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts presented in th e financial statements and the notes thereto. 226Those estimates and assumptions, prepared on the basi s of information available at the end of the reporting period, relate in particular to: - the level and pattern of recognition of revenue from industrial services contracts with \"CDMO\" customers; - estimates of variable consideration (see Note B.11.); - the recoverable amount of cash generating units (see Note B.6.); - the carrying amount of inventories, and the amount of allowances for impairment and destruction of inventories (see Note B.8.); - the measurement of assets and liabilities relating to post-employment benefits (see Note B.18.); - the recoverability of deferred tax assets; and - the amount of provisions for risks (see Note B.10.), including environmental risks. Before final completion of the Prior Reorganizati on Transactions, additional estimates and assumptions were made for the purposes of preparing the historical financial statements, in particular those relating to EUROAPI activities housed within Sanofi entities and costs attributable to administrative and general services provided by the Sanofi group (see Note A.3.2.). B. Significant accounting policies B.1. General principles The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS general principles of fair presentation, going concern, accrua l basis of accounting, consistency of presentation, materiality, and aggregation. B.2. New amendments and interpretations mandatorily applicable from 2021 and later B.2.1 New standards, amendments and interpretations mandatorily applicable from January 1, 2021 The new standards, amendments and interpretations i ssued by the IASB that are mandatorily applicable from 2021 or later are described below, along w ith EUROAPI's position regarding their future application. In its March 2021 update, the IFRS IC published a fi nal agenda decision clarifying how to account for costs of configuring or customizing a supplier's appl ication software in a Software as a Service (SaaS) arrangement, which requires such costs to be recogni zed as an expense. First-time application of that decision did not have a material impact on the EU ROAPI financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the effects of the April 2021 IFRS IC agenda decision on attributing post-employment benefit costs to periods of service were reflected in the EUROAPI financial statements as of December 31, 2021. EUROAPI applied this inte rpretation retrospectively, in accordance with IAS 8, in its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 20 20 and 2019 as closed off on December 15, 2021 (see Note A.3.1.). The principal effects of applying the IFRS IC agenda decision were to increase both consolidated shareholders' equity and pe rsonnel costs from January 1, 2019 onwards. The impacts of those IFRS changes on the EUROAPI financial statements are regarded as immaterial. EUROAPI has adopted early in its financial statemen ts for December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amendment of IFRS 9 Phase 2 relating to interest rate benc hmark reform, impacts are regarded as immaterial. 227B.2.2. Standards, amendments and interpretations applicable from 2022 at the earliest This note describes standards, amendments and inte rpretations issued by the IASB that will have mandatory application in 2022 or subsequent years, and EUROAPI's position regarding future application. On May 14, 2020, the IASB issued \"Reference to the Conceptual Framework\", an amendment to IFRS 3; \"Proceeds before Intended Use\", an amendm ent to IAS 16; \"Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract\", an amendment to IAS 37; and \"Annual Improvements to IFRS standards 2018- 2020\". EUROAPI does not expect a material impact from those amendments, which are applicable at the earliest from January 1, 2022 (subject to endor sement by the European Union). EUROAPI is not early adopting those amendments. On January 23, 2020, the IASB issued \"Classificat ion of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\", an amendment to IAS 1. On February 12, 2021, the IA SB published an amendment to IAS 1 on disclosure of accounting policies, and an amendment to IAS 8 on the definition of accounting estimates. On May 7, 2021, the IASB published an amendment to IA S 12 on deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction. EUROAPI does not expect a ma terial impact from those amendments, which are applicable at the earliest from January 1, 2023 (subject to endorsement by the European Union). EUROAPI is not early adopting those amendments. B.3. Foreign currency translation B.3.1. Accounting for foreign currency transactions in the consolidated financial statements Non-monetary items in the statement of financia l position derived from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional cu rrency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are recognized as foreign exchange gain s or losses in the income statement. B.3.2. Foreign currency translation of the financial statements of foreign entities EUROAPI presents its consolidated financial statemen ts in euros (\u20ac). In accordance with IAS 21 (The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates), ea ch subsidiary accounts for its transactions in the currency that is most representative of its econom ic environment (the entity's functional currency). All assets and liabilities are translated into euros using the exchange ra te of the subsidiary's functional currency prevailing at the end of the reporting peri od. Income and expenses re cognized in the income statement are translated using a weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting currency translation differences are rec ognized within a separate lin e item in the statement of comprehensive income. B.4. Intangible assets B.4.1. Acquired software Intangible assets, which mainly comprise acquired or internally-developed computer software, are amortized on a straight line basis over their usef ul lives, of between three and five years. The useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed regu larly at the end of each reporting period. In the event of a change in estimate of the amortizati on period, the amortization charge is adjusted prospectively. Amortization charged against intangible assets is rec ognized in the income statement according to the nature and use of each intangi ble asset taken individually. 228Intangible assets are carried at cost, minus (i) accumulated amortization and (ii) any accumulated impairment losses recognized in accordance with IA S 36 (Impairment of Assets) (see Note B.6.). Software licenses are capitalized at acquisition cost, in cluding any directly attributable cost of preparing the software for its intended use. Software licenses are amortized on a st raight-line basis over their useful lives for EUROAPI (three to five years). Internally generated costs incurred to develop or upgr ade software are capitalized if the criteria specified in IAS 38 (Intangible Assets) are satisfied and are am ortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the software. B.4.2. Internally generated research and development Research expenditure is systematically recognized as an expense when incurred. Development expenditure comprises expenditure incu rred on in-house programs to develop or improve industrial manufacturing processes prior to operational and industrial use. Because such developments are subject to risks and uncertainties inherent to EU ROAPI's activities, the six criteria for capitalization are considered not to have been met until the asset de veloped has moved into operational and industrial use. Consequently, internally ge nerated development expenditure (m ainly comprising primary costs of development platforms) is genera lly expensed as incurred within Research and development expenses . Conversely, where the six IAS 38 criteria are cons idered as having been met, such expenses are recognized as an asset in the statement of financial position within Intangible assets as incurred. Intangible assets derived from in-house development pr ojects are amortized over their useful lives. If the asset contributes to the inventory production cycle, the related amortization expense is incorporated in the cost of inventory; otherwise, it is rec ognized as a component of operating income within the appropriate income statement line item. B.5. Property, plant and equipment owned and leased B.5.1. Property, plant and equipment owned Property, plant and equipment is initially measured and recognized at acquisition cost, including any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use. The component-based approach to accounting for property, plant and equipment is applied. After initial measurement as indicated above (repr esenting the gross value), property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depr eciation and impairment, except for land which is carried at cost less impairment. The gross value of items of property, plant and equipm ent, net of any residual value (estimated disposal value at the end of the asset's useful life), is depreci ated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. The useful life of an asset is usually equivalent to its economic life. The useful lives applied to property, plant and equipment are as follows: Buildings 15 to 40 years Fixtures 10 to 20 years Machinery and equipment 5 to 15 years Other 3 to 15 years Useful lives and residual values of property, plant an d equipment are reviewed regularly. The effect of any adjustment to useful lives or residual values is recognized prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. Depreciation charged against items of property, plan t and equipment is incorporated in the cost of inventory (see Note B.8.) or expensed when incu rred. Depreciation expense is presented within the income statement line item that corresponds to the function in which the asset is used. 229Property, plant and equipment that is in process of construction and unavailable for use is depreciated from the date on which it is br ought into service, defined as the date of acceptance of the asset for operational use. B.5.2. Property, plant and equipment leased Under IFRS 16 (Leases), a contract or part of a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset fo r a period of time in exchange for consideration. EUROAPI recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liab ility at the commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, and then at cost less accu mulated depreciation and impairment; the amount may also be adjusted to reflect certain remeasureme nts of the lease liability. The lease liability is initia lly measured at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid at the commencement date. The discount rate used is the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that cannot be readily determined, the lessee's in cremental borrowing rate (based on the lease term, not maturities). The EUROAPI group generally uses the latter rate as a discount rate; it corresponds to the risk-free rate for the currency in which the lease is denominated, plus an uplift for cr edit risk over the duration of the payments. Subsequently, the lease liability is increased to reflect interest on the liability and reduced by the amount of the lease payments made. It is remeasured if future lease payments are modified following changes in an index or rate, or if the Group reassesses whether to exercise an option to purchase or a termination option. EUROAPI has elected to use the exemptions permitte d under IFRS 16 relating to leases with a term of twelve months or less and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on such leases are recognized when incurred as an operating expense, within the rele vant income statement line item for the use of the leased asset. B.6. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets In accordance with IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets) , property, plant and equipment and amortized intangible assets are tested for impairment when th ere is an indication that they may have become impaired. Indications of impairment are assessed using quantitative and qualitative criteria. The qualitative criteria used relate mainly to ri sks of non-compliance with pharmaceutical industry regulations and good manufacturi ng practices, and technological a dvances. The quantitative criteria used relate to commercial and manufacturing activity levels that could have lasting negative effects on EUROAPI's operating results. If there is an indication that an individual asset ma y have become impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined separately if possible, or at the level of th e cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Identifying such asset groups involves the exercise of judgement by manageme nt, based on how operations are managed. Cash-generating units are identified consistently fro m period to period, unless a change is justified. The recoverable amount of a CGU is also determined if there is an indication that the CGU itself may have become impaired. Recoverable amount is the higher of (i) selling price less co sts to sell or (ii) value in use. Value in use is determined by discounting cash flow projections for the assets tested. Those cash flow projections are based on management's economic assumptions and forecasts of operating conditions. If impairment tests show that a CGU is impaired, th e impairment loss is allocated first to any goodwill allocated to that CGU and then to all the other ass ets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying 230amount of each asset, though without reducing the carry ing amount of an asset below the higher of (i) fair value less costs of disposal (if measurable ) or (ii) its value in use (if determinable). The CGUs of the EUROAPI group mainly comprise de preciable items of property, plant and equipment and inventories measured at cost, so any impairme nt losses are determined consistently with the replacement value of those assets taken individually. Impairment losses taken against property, plant a nd equipment are presented as an operating expense within the income statement line item that corres ponds to the function in which the asset is used. B.7. Financial instruments B.7.1. Non-derivative financial assets In accordance with IFRS 9 (Financi al Instruments) and IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Presentation), the classification of non-derivative financial assets adopted by EUROAPI as presented in the consolidated financial statements is described below. The classification used depends on (i) the characteristics of the contractual cash flows (i.e. whether they represent interest or principal) and (ii) the business model for managing the asset applie d at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are cl assified in the statement of financial position within the line items Other non-current assets , Other current assets , and Cash and cash equivalents . B.7.2. Financial assets at amortized cost Financial assets at amortized cost comprise in struments whose contractual cash flows represent payments of interest and repaymen ts of principal and which are managed with a view to collecting cash flows. The main assets in this category are loans and receivables. They are presented within the line items Other non-current assets , Other current assets , Accounts receivable and Cash and cash equivalents . Loans with a maturity of more than 12 months are presented in \"Long-term loans and advances\" within Other non-current assets . These financial assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. B.7.3. Impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost The main assets involved are accounts receivable. A ccounts receivable are initially recognized at the amount invoiced to the customer. Impairment losses on trade accounts receivable are estimated using the expected loss method, in order to take account of the risk of payment default throughout the lifetime of the receivables. The expected credit loss is estim ated collectively for all accounts receivable at the end of each reporting period using an average expected loss rate, determined primarily on the basis of historical credit loss rates. Howeve r, that average expected loss rate may be adjusted if there are indications of a likely significant increase in credit ri sk. If a receivable is subject to a known credit risk, a specific impairment loss is recognized for that r eceivable. The amount of expected losses is recognized in the statement of financial position as a reducti on in the gross amount of accounts receivable. Impairment losses on accounts receivable are recognized within Commercial and distribution expenses in the income statement. B.7.4. Non-derivative financial liabilities Financial liabilities comprise accounts payable. Accounts payabl e are measured at fair value (which in most cases equates to face value) on initial rec ognition, and subsequently at amortized cost. B.7.5. Fair value of financial instruments 231Under IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement) and IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments: Disclosures), fair value measurements must be classified using a hierarchy b ased on the inputs used to measure the fair value of the instrument. This hierarchy has three levels: - level 1: quoted prices in active markets for iden tical assets or liabilities (without modification or repackaging); - level 2: quoted prices in active markets for sim ilar assets and liabilities, or valuation techniques in which all critical inputs are derived from observable market data; and - level 3: valuation techniques in which not all critical inputs are derived from observable market data. The table below shows the disclosures required under IFRS 7 relating to the measurement principles applied to financial instruments. Method used to determine fair value Market data Note Type of financial instrument Measurement principle Level in fair value hierarchy Valuation technique Valuation model Exchange rate Interest rate D.10.1. Financial assets measured at fair value held to meet obligations under post- employment benefit plans Fair value 1 Market value Quoted market price N/A D.7. / D.12. Long-term loans and advances, and other non- current receivables and payables Amortized cost N/A N/A The amortized cost of long-term loans and advances, and other non-current receivables and payables, is not materially different from their fair value at the end of the reporting period. D.6. / D11. Trade accounts receivable and payable Amortized cost N/A N/A Trade accounts receivable and payable are measured at fair value (which in most cases equates to face value) on initial recognition, and subsequently at amortized cost. B.8. Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is calculated using weighted average cost or the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The cost of inventories mainly comprises the purcha se cost of materials used in the manufacture of products; direct and indirect labor costs; depreci ation charged during the period against production lines used to manufacture inventories; other expenses su ch as the operating costs of the industrial facilities where inventories are manufactured; and other costs incurred to bring inventories to their present location and condition. EUROAPI assesses inventory levels relative to sales at each reporting date. Pr oduction and inventory levels of active ingredients manufactured to meet contractual obligations unde r supply contracts entered into by EUROAPI are calibrated so as to meet the needs of the customer. Wh en items produced for a customer cannot be sold or reallocated for alternativ e commercial use, an allo wance for destruction is recognized. At each reporting date, EUROAPI applies impa irment criteria that take account of inventory turn, obsolescence, net realizable value, and non-compliant production outputs. Decisions on impairment allowances are taken for each product id entified as being within one of those categories. EUROAPI applies the principle stipulated in paragraph 9 of IAS 2 whereby inventories must be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable va lue. Chemical raw materials and work in process are only written down by reference to the recoverable amount of finished products, in accordance with paragraph 32 of IAS 2. However, they may be writt en down if they are intended for a single customer which terminates its supply contract or decides to suspend manufacture of the product. Raw materials and in-process active ingredients are subject to a lesser risk of becoming time-expired than pharmaceutical products, which are subject to fixed use-by dates. At the end of the manufacturing 232process, finished products are ch ecked for compliance with quality standards appropriate for their intended use, and with customer specifications. At th at stage, the only inventories that can be written down are batches that have failed compliance chec ks and cannot be returned to production. The recoverable amount of finished prod ucts that have cleared complianc e checks is measured in accordance with paragraph 9 of IAS 2 at each reporting date by reference to market or contract price, with an impairment allowance recognized if that is lower than the carrying amount of the inventory in the statement of financial position. Consequently, EUROAPI may make adjustments to th e carrying amount of inventories in the statement of financial position to allow for excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventories in line with changes in customer demand; stricter quality requirements aris ing from technological or regulatory developments; or other economic factors. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. If net realizable value is less than the carrying amount in the statement of financial position, an impairment allowance is recognized to cover the difference, applying the principles described above. B.9. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents as shown in the statemen t of financial position and statement of cash flows comprise cash, plus liquid short-term investments that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of ch anges in value in the event of movements in interest rates. With the exception of legal entities that exclusiv ely carry on EUROAPI activi ties (see Note F.), cash flows derived from EUROAPI activities housed with in Sanofi legal entities are treated as equity transactions with equity holders of Sanofi, the effects of which were recorded within consolidated equity (see Note A.3.4.) until final completion of the Prior Reorganization Transactions. Legal entities that exclusively carry on EUROAPI ac tivities (see Note F.) are included in the Sanofi group cash pooling agreement. Consequently, the related year-end balances are included within Other financial assets (in the case of debit balances) or Other financial liabilities (in the case of credit balances) in the EUROAPI statement of financial position. Subsequent to the Prior Reorganization Transactions , the cash pooling agreemen t remains in force on the same terms and conditions as those that apply within the Sanofi group. B.10. Provisions for risks In accordance with IAS 37 (Provisions, Conti ngent Liabilities and Contingent Assets), EUROAPI records a provision when it has a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources em bodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the outflow of resources. Provisions are measured at the present value of th e costs necessary to meet the oblig ation. If part of the obligation may be met through compensation from a third part y, such compensation is recognized as a separate asset if it is certain to be received. Restructuring provisions are recognized on the date the obligation arises, i.e. when the EUROAPI group (i) has a detailed, formal restructuring plan and (ii) has raised a valid expectation in those affected th at it will carry out the restructuring. A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events a nd whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of an uncertain future event outside the control of the EUROAPI group. A contingent liability that does not lead to a probable outflow of resources, or the amount of which cannot be reliably measured, is disclosed in th e notes to the combined financial statements, unless the probability of an outflow of resources is remote. EUROAPI estimates provisions on the basis of events and circumstances related to present obligations and of past experience of similar situations , and to the best of management's knowledge. 233For environmental risks, EUROAPI recognizes a pr ovision where there is a legal or constructive obligation to remediate harm to human health or th e environment resulting from contamination at a site, and the cost can be reliably measured. The amount of the provision is a best estimate of future expenditures to be incurred on the environmental re mediation plans assessed on the basis of the costs that the group considers itself to have to face ove r an average period not exceeding, unless exceptions, ten years. Sites identified as exposed to environmental risks ar e permanently monitored. Existing provisions are judged to be adequate based on av ailable information. However, given uncertainties as to the amount and timing of future expenditures and regulatory changes, provisions for environmental risks may require significant adjustment in future periods. Provisions for environmental liabilities are recognized as \"Cost of sales\" when the provision relates to operating sites or as \"Other operating expenses\" when these relates to non-operating sites. Where the effect of the time value of money is ma terial, those provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation, calculated using a discount rate that reflects an estimate of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. In determining the present value of these commitments, discount rates reflecting the estimated time value of money and the risks specific to these co mmitments shall be taken into account. Increases in provisions to reflect the effects of the passage of time are recognized within Financial expenses . Provisions for litigation are presented within the releva nt line item for the nature of the litigation. The impacts of litigation regarded as unusual in terms of its nature, history or amount are recognized within Other gains and losses, and litigation . B.11. Revenue recognition EUROAPI recognizes revenue consistently with the revenue recognition model specified in IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers). EUROAPI derives a substantial proportion of its revenues from the supply of manufactured or distributed active pharmaceutical ingredients, in part icular via its API Solutions business; it also derives revenues (though to a lesser extent) from contract ma nufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients, involving the supply of high added value industria l services under CDMO contracts with certain third- party customers (see Note D.8.). Revenue from sales of manufactured or distributed active pharmaceutical ingredients The bulk of EUROAPI revenues derives from sales of manufactured or distributed active pharmaceutical ingredients. Sales are presented within Net sales in the income statement at an amount that reflects the consideration received in exchange for satisfying performance obligations, when it is highly probable that there will be no revenue reversal. Net sales ar e reported after deducting ma nagement's best estimate of the amount of product returns and of othe r commercial rebates gr anted to customers. EUROAPI does not recognize sales returns for any reason other than non-compliance supported by analyses carried out by the customer on receipt of the product. Products declared as non-compliant by customers are not returned to inve ntory and recognized in the statement of financial position unless the active ingredients returned can be reprocessed and ultimately resold. Volume-based incentives are determined mainly on annual cycles, and are estimated on the basis of firm customer orders. The estimated amounts described above are recogni zed in the income statement as deductions from gross sales, with the corresponding entry recognized within Other current liabilities in the statement of financial position. They are subject to regular review and are adjusted as appropriate based on the latest information available to management. EUROAPI beli eves that it has the ability to measure each of the above amounts reliably, based on commercial practices and cumulative past experience. 234Revenue from the supply of industrial services EUROAPI also supplies high added value industria l services under service contracts. Those services include formulation, galenic and analytical deve lopment, quality control, regulatory support, and product life cycle management; in return for those services, EUROAPI receives financial consideration. Amounts received from those activities are recognize d as revenue, with the corresponding entry being recognized as a receivable, once th e performance obligations defined at contract inception are satisfied (i.e. when control over the goods and services promi sed under the contract is transferred to the customer). At the inception of each contract, management determines what goods and services are promised under the contract, and the pattern of tran sfer to the customer. Where control is transferred over time, management determines a method for m easuring the progress towards transfer, which may be based on inputs (such as costs incurred) or on output s (by reference to units produced or shipped). If it is not possible to measure progress reliably, EU ROAPI recognizes revenue equal to the amount of costs incurred and rechargeable to the customer. If a contract is for the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the sale is recognized when the products are physically delivered. Where a contract includes a \"stand-ready\" performance obligation, EUROAPI re cognizes the associated revenue on a straight-line basis over the total duration of the contract. If a contract includes a significant financing compon ent due to the payment terms exceeding twelve months, that component is taken into account when determining the transaction price and reflected in the amount of revenue recognized. Accordingly, a financial expense is recognized where EUROAPI receives financing, and financial income where EUROAPI grants financing. Recognizing revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with the IFRS 15 revenue recognition model requires EUROAPI management to make assump tions and judgements (see Note A.5.); this may have an impact on how accounting treatments are applied, and on the amounts, presented in the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that it is in a position to make assumptions and exercise judgement based on facts and circumstances as of the end of the reporting period, based on operational experience. Those assumptions and judgement s are periodically reviewed to take account of significant changes in the context and economic co nditions in which EUROAPI operates. Judgements exercised in applying IFRS 15 relate primarily to: - measurement of efforts to meet a performance obligation in contracts where the obligation is transferred to the customer over time, and de termination of the amount and date on which revenue is recognized; - determination of the duration of the contract and transaction price in cases where the contract allows the customer an extension option or an option to acquire additional goods or services, and the assessment, measurement and recognition of such option rights where material; and - determination of the quantities sp ecified in the contract, where th e contract includes variable or optional quantities. Industrial services contract costs Costs incurred on industrial services contracts w ith customers are recognized as an asset within Other current assets in the statement of financial position when they meet the IFRS 15 capitalization criteria for contract costs, i.e. when they (i) are directly attributable to the contract; (ii) generate resources that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation defined in the contract; and (iii) are recoverable without directly benefiting the customer. Such co sts essentially comprise e xpenditure incurred by EUROAPI in the pre-production phase that is n ecessary for bringing the industrial plant and manufacturing facilities into line with the customer's specifications, and for transferring the technology to the customer. These incurred costs, which are necessary for performing the contract but do not benefit the customer directly, are recognized in th e EUROAPI statement of financial position. Contract costs are systematically capitalized when they meet th e criteria specified above. When production and performance of the service specified in the contract starts, the contract costs are taken to profit or loss within Cost of sales (see Note B.12.) over the contract performance period, following the same pattern as for revenue recognition in line with the approach described above. 235Advance payments received in respect of industrial services contracts Payments received from customers in the pre-pr oduction phase that represent future revenues are recognized within Other current liabilities ; they are then released to profit or loss once performance of the contract starts, following the same pattern as fo r the transfer of performance obligations to the customer in line with the appr oach described above in the \" Revenue from the supply of industrial services \" section. Customer contract assets and liabilities are presented in Note D.8. B.12. Cost of sales Cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients sold Cost of sales mainly comprises the direct and indirect manuf acturing costs of active ingredients sold by EUROAPI. The manufacturing cost of active ingredient s sold includes (i) direct costs of materials and solvents used in the manufacturing process; (ii) depreciation expenses corres ponding to the normal use of property, plant and equipment and software for manufacturing pur poses; and (iii) personnel and other costs directly attributable to production and to site operation. Capitalized contract costs recognized in profit or loss over the contract perf ormance period (see Note B.11.) Costs incurred by EUROAPI in the pre-production phase of service and industrial development contracts with customers are capitalized when (i) they do not represent a performa nce obligation and (ii) they are necessary for fulfilment of the contract. Those co sts are then taken to profit or loss within Cost of sales once the contract performance phase st arts, following the same pattern as for the transfer of performance obligations to the customer and for recogn izing the associated revenue (see Note B.11). B.13. Amortization of intangible assets Amortization is charged against intangible assets (inc luding software) within the income statement line item appropriate to the purpose for whic h the asset is used (see Note D.3.). B.14. Other operating income and expenses Other operating income and Other operating expenses include realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on operating activities (see Notes D.16. and D.17.), and gains and losses on disposals of non-financial assets. These line items also include other income and expenses that are of an operating nature but do not contribute to ge nerating operating income during the period. B.15. Restructuring costs Restructuring costs are expenses incurred in connecti on with the transformation or reorganization of the EUROAPI group's operations or support functions. Such costs include collective redundancy plans; compensation to third parties for early termination of contracts; commitments made in connection with transformation or reorganization decisions; and cost s related to temporary shutdowns of sites or production lines associated with such programs. Th ey also include accelerat ed depreciation charges arising from closures of production facilities (including leased facilities), and losses on asset disposals resulting from such decisions. B.16. Financial income and expenses Financial income and Financial expenses mainly comprise interest received and paid as a result of transactions with Sanofi group entities (see Note D.22.) not included in the scope of consolidation. 236Financial expenses also include expenses arising from the unwinding of discount on long-term provisions, and the net interest co st related to employee benefits. B.17. Income taxes Current and deferred taxes are determined as though the EUROAPI group had been constituted of legal entities required to submit separate tax returns (see Note A.3.3.) prior to the date of formation of the EUROAPI legal entities; tax receivables and payables that pre-date the legal reorganization are deemed to have been settled on the basis of tax payment d eadlines, with the correspon ding entry recorded in EUROAPI's reserves as a component of equity invested by Sanofi. Tax gains arising from tax loss carry-forwards gene rated by EUROAPI activities that belong to a tax group within Sanofi are deemed to have been distributed to the Sanofi group during the period and are reflected in equity (see Note A.3.4. ) to the extent that they were not included in the assets and liabilities transferred as part of the Prior Reorganization Transactions. Deferred taxes on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and taxable bases of assets and liabilities reflected in the EUROAPI statement of financial position are recognized where they exist and it is regarded as probable that they will be utilized. B.18. Employee benefits Pension plans and other post-empl oyment benefits (and their respective portions of plan liabilities and assets, interest and service cost) have been accounted for on the basis of an actuarial valuation of the rights vested or currently vesting in EUROAPI em ployees and retirees, using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Benefits are provided in the form of either defi ned contribution plans or defined benefit plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, the cost is recognized immediately in the period in which it is incurred, and equates to the amount of the contributions paid by EUROAPI. For defined benefit plans, EUROAPI generally reco gnizes its obligations to pay pensions and similar benefits to employees as a liability, based on an actua rial estimate of the rights vested or currently vesting in employees, using the projected unit credit method. Estimates are performed at the end of each reporting period, and rely on financial assumpti ons (such as discount ra tes) and demographic assumptions (such as life expectancy, retirement ag e, employee turnover, and the rate of salary increases). In the case of multi-employer defined benefit plan s where plan assets cannot be allocated to each participating employer with sufficient reliability, the plan is accounted for as a defined contribution plan, in accordance with paragraph 34 of IAS 19. Obligations relating to other post-employment benef its (healthcare and life insurance) offered by Sanofi to EUROAPI employees are also recognized as a liab ility based on an actuarial estimate of the rights vested or currently vesting in EUROAPI em ployees at the end of the reporting period. Employee benefit obligations are recognized net of the fair value of plan assets. The benefit cost for the period consists primarily of current service cost, past service cost, net interest cost, gains or losses arising from plan settlements not specified in the terms of the plan, and actuarial gains or losses arising from plan curtailments. Net inter est cost for the period is determined by applying the discount rate specified in IAS 19 to the net liability (i.e. the amount of the obligation, net of plan assets) recognized in respect of defined benefit plan s. Past service cost is recognized immediately in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred, re gardless of whether or not the rights have vested at the time of adoption (in the case of a new plan) or of amendment (in the case of an existing plan). Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans (p ensions and other post-empl oyment benefits), also referred to as \"Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset)\", arise as a result of changes 237in financial and demographic assumptions, experien ce adjustments, and the difference between the actual return and interest cost on plan assets. Th e impacts of those remeasu rements are recognized in Other comprehensive income , net of deferred taxes; they are not subsequently reclassifiable to profit or loss. B.19. Share-based payment B.19.1. Employee share ownership plans Sanofi may offer its employees the opportunity to subscr ibe to reserved share is sues at a discount to the reference market price. Shares awarded to EUROAP I employees under such plans fall within the scope of IFRS 2. Consequently, an expense is recognized at the subscription date, based on the value of the discount offered to employees. B.19.2. Restricted share plans Sanofi may award restricted share plans to certain of its employees. The terms of those plans may make the award contingent on the attainment of pe rformance criteria for some of the grantees. In accordance with IFRS 2, an expense equivalent to the fair value of such plans is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the plan, with the opposite entry recognized in equity. The vesting period is three years and that period is reflected in the EUROAPI consolidated financial statements. The fair value of restricted share plans is based on th e quoted market price per share at the date of grant, adjusted for expected dividends during the vesting pe riod; it also takes account of any vesting conditions contingent on stock market performance. Other vesti ng conditions are taken into account in the estimate of the number of shares awarded during the vesting period; that number is then definitively adjusted based on the actual number of shares awarded on the vesting date. C. Principal agreements C.1. Principal agreements governing the carve out from Sanofi Master Carve Out Agreement In connection with the Prior Reorganization Tran sactions, EUROAPI and Sanofi signed a Master Carve Out Agreement effective October 1, 2021, setting out the general principles and arrangements for transferring the assets and liabilities associated with the EUROAPI activities. That agreement contains certain limitations of liabilities in respect of the tr ansferred activities and the related assets and liabilities, and certain indemnity undertakings, that impact the EUROAPI consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. The indemnities granted by Sanofi under the Master Carve Out Agreement are described below. - Certain transferred environmenta l liabilities indemnified by Sanofi Sanofi has agreed to indemnify EUROAPI with eff ect from October 1, 2021 for all costs incurred by EUROAPI arising from remediation measures initiated by the Sanofi group and not yet complete at the transfer date, on certain non-operational parcels of land at the Vertolaye and Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf sites in France further to pollution, contaminati on or hazardous substance discharges caused by the transferred activities. The indemnity granted by Sanofi is capped at \u20ac16.7 million, and is valid up to and including September 30, 2026. As of December 31, 2021, that indemnity - rec ognized as a receivable in EUROAPI's consolidated statement of financial position, within the line item Other non-current assets - amounted to \u20ac14.5 million, after taking account of paym ents of \u20ac2 million made between Oc tober 1 and December 31. That 238amount matches the liability for EUROAPI's envir onmental exposure in respect of the relevant transferred sites (see Note D.10.). - Certain non-transferred environmental liabilities retained by Sanofi Sanofi retains the remediation obliga tion relating to the \"Marat\" parcel of land situated close to the Vertolaye site in France; only the freehold of that pa rcel of land was transferred as of October 1, 2021, with the transfer of the operating license contingent on Sanofi completing the remediation works. That undertaking is valid until the earlier of (i) completio n of the principal remediation measures as required and attested by the competent authorities or (ii) the date on which administrative responsibility for the environmental situation at the \"Marat\" parcel of land is transferred to the EUROAPI group. The legal remediation obligation retain ed by Sanofi, and reflected in th e historical financial statements at an amount of \u20ac14.6 million, was therefore not transferred to EUROAPI as part of the Prior Reorganization Transactions, and has been treated as an equity transaction (see Note D.10.). - Certain regulatory compliance expenditures rela ting to certain EUROAPI active pharmaceutical ingredients Sanofi has agreed to indemnify EUROAPI with effect from October 1, 2021 for certain expenditures to be incurred in order to achieve regulatory complia nce. The indemnity is capped at \u20ac15.0 million, and relates to the costs of the \"State of the Art\" regulatory review of certain active pharmaceutical ingredients as agreed between the parties that come within the scope of the activities transferred to EUROAPI. That undertaking is valid up to and including September 30, 2025, and is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (see Note D. 23.) as an off balance sheet commitment received by EUROAPI. - Certain undertakings in favor of BASF Agri production SAS (BASF) Sanofi has made an undertaking in the form of a \u20ac21 million guarantee to indemnify EUROAPI against any loss it may incur in respect of an obligation, under a carve out agreement between BASF and Sanofi dated February 13, 2004 (as amende d, in particular by the tripartite agreement dated September 28, 2021) that was transferred to EUROAPI consecutively w ith the transfer of the Saint-Aubin-l\u00e8s-Elbeuf site pursuant to the Prior Reorganization Transactions , to indemnify BASF for losses incurred as a result of environmental incidents. This undertaking is disclosed as an off-balance sheet commitment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (see Note D.23.). - \"Play to Win\" employee-related restructuring lia bilities and certain other short-term employee benefits Under tripartite agreements entere d into by Sanofi, EUROAPI and the EUROAPI employees transferred as of the date of the Prior Reorganization Transactions (October 1, 2021) who are eligible for the various voluntary redundancy plans (including an end-of-career paid leave plan and an end-of-career transition plan) initiated within France in 2020 in connection with the \"Play to Win\" stra tegy and still ongoing in 2021, Sanofi has agreed to bear the liabilities arising under those plans. Consequently, the liabilities recognized in respect of those plans (see Notes D. 10. and D.18.) were not transferred to EUROAPI when the employees were tran sferred on October 1, 2021, the date of the asset transfer in France. The non-transferred employee-relate d liabilities, recognized historically as liabilities owed to Sanofi (Note A.3.3.) and presented within Other non-current liabilities in the EUROAPI consolidated 239statement of financial position, were deemed to have been settled as of the date of the Prior Reorganization Transactions and treated as an equity transaction. The amount of those liabilities in the books of EUR OAPI was \u20ac18.9 million as of the date of transfer on October 1, 2021; \u20ac24.6 million as of December 31, 2020; and \u20ac10.3 million as of December 31, 2019. Sanofi has also agreed to bear the other liabilities in respect of short-term empl oyee benefits awarded to the employees transferred to EUROAPI, such as collective variable compensation and voluntary/ statutory profit-sharing up to and including the date of the transaction (see the \"Introduction\" section). - Other guarantees given In accordance with the undertakings made in the Master Carve Out Agreement, EUROAPI benefits from environmental insurance contracted by Sanofi fo r a 10-year period commencing October 1, 2021, providing coverage of up to \u20ac50 million for environmental liabilities not yet identified as of the transfer date and originating prior to implementation of the Prior Reorganization Transactions (or in some cases, prior to the EUROAPI initial public offering). The insurance is subject to the customary exclusions for environmental liability cover. The policy, the entire cost of which is borne by Sanofi, will be transferred to EUROAPI at the date of the initial public offeri ng; provided by the controlling entity until completion of the transaction, it covers EUROAPI against public liability in respect of pollution and remediation. This undertaking is disclosed as an off-balance sheet commitment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (see Note D.23.). C.2. Principal commercial agreements with Sanofi In parallel with the Master Carve Out Agreemen t as described above, EUROAPI and Sanofi have entered into commercial agreements, the principal ones of which are as follows: Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement Consistently with their long-established relationshi p, on October 1, 2021 EUROAPI and Sanofi entered into a Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreem ent covering active pharmaceutical ingredients, intermediates and other substances, for a five-year term starting from the date of the EUROAPI initial public offering in 2022. The agreement provides for exclusivity of supply of certain active pharmaceutical ingredients, and specifies the pric ing terms on which commercial transactions between Sanofi and EUROAPI will be conducted through the en tire contractual term. It also contains a number of price adjustment clauses assessed on an annual basis, including: - Price Volume Corridor clause: co mpensates one or the other party in the event of variances above or below specified target levels of revenue fo r a list of active pharmaceutical ingredients, as defined for an initial three-year period; - Capacity Reservation clause: compensates EU ROAPI for any failure by Sanofi to order the annual quantities reserved, for a specified list of active pharmaceutical ingredients; - Performance clause: applies certain supplementary financial terms and conditions relative to the invoice price; and - Raw Material Pass Through clause, compensati ng EUROAPI for any significant rise in the price of certain materials and excipients used in the manufacture of certain active pharmaceutical ingredients for Sanofi. Under the terms of the Global Ma nufacturing and Supply Agreement, since October 1, 2021 sales to Sanofi have been made on the basis of the new pric ing terms. The price adjustment clauses described above did not take effect until Janua ry 1, 2022, and consequently have no effect on sales made since the date of signature of the agreement. 240Specific financial arrangements have also been agreed between the parties for the supply of lixisenatide, an active pharmaceutical ingredient used in the manufacture of SoliquaTM, an injectable treatment for type 2 diabetes. Under those arrangements, Sanofi agrees to make advance payments of \u20ac10.4 million over the next three years to help finance some items of plant and equipment required at the EUROAPI site in Frankfurt (Germany) for the manufacture of active ingredients intended for use in Sanofi licensed biologic medicines. The amounts received as of December 31, 2021 were immaterial. Other agreements In parallel to the Global Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, other service and industrial development agreements have been entered into. Those agreements govern activities historically carried on by EUROAPI with Sanofi, and relate mainly to: - subcontracting activities, governing historical activities carried out by Sanofi on behalf of EUROAPI during the period from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2026 involving the manufacture of vitamin B12 salts and of active pharmaceutical ingredients from the Francopia alkaloids family (see Note D.22.); - a Master Compound Development Agreement, entered into with Sanofi Recherche et D\u00e9veloppement for a five-year period from Oct ober 1, 2021, under which services and industrial development activities relating to active pharmaceutical ingredients are carried out by either of the parties for the other, in return for financial consideration (see Note B.13); - activities involving the packing of finished pharm aceutical products at the industrial facility at Haverhill (UK) on behalf of Sanofi in re turn for financial consideration (see note B.11); this agreement took effect on January 1, 2022 for a five-year period from the transaction date. As from the date of signature of this agreement, which modifies the agent/principal relationship between the two companies, pricing terms have been reviewed in order to reflect the new business relationship. - distribution of active pharmaceutical ingredie nts manufactured by Sanofi and commercialized by EUROAPI, taking effect from October 1, 2021 for a five-year period from the transaction date. Such transactions are recognized on the basis of the new contractual pricing terms applicable as of and from the date of signature of those agreements. 241D. Presentation of the financial statements D.1. Principal changes in scope due to acquisitions and divestments D.1.1.

(b) In 2020, a total impairment loss of \u20ac10.6 million was recognize d in \"Other operating expenses\" (see Note D.17.), mainly com prising a \u20ac9.8 million loss arising as a result of th e discontinuation of the FRAMAP project in Germany. That project, initiated in 2014, was intended mainly to upgrade the German manufacturing facility as a secondary site for the supply of essential phospholipids, a highly-pur ified soya- based active ingredient used in Essentiale (a Sanofi Consumer He althcare product indicated for th e treatment of liver complaint s). D.2.2 Right-of-use assets Right-of-use assets relating to property, plant and equipment held under leases break down as follows: (\u20ac million) Right-of-use assets Gross value at January 1, 2019 51.0 Acquisitions and other increases 0.6 Disposals and other decreases (0.3) Gross value at December 31, 2019 51.3 Acquisitions and other increases 1.1 Disposals and other decreases (1.1) Gross value at December 31, 2020 51.3 Acquisitions and other increases 8.8 Disposals and other decreases (1.2) 243Transfers (b) (0.8) Gross value at December 31, 2021 57.9 Accumulated depreciation and impairment at January 1, 2019 - Depreciation expense and impairment losses (a) (3.9) Disposals and other decreases 0.2 Accumulated depreciation and impairment at December 31, 2019 (3.7) Depreciation expense and impairment losses (a) (4.0) Disposals and other decreases 0.2 Accumulated depreciation and impairment at December 31, 2020 (7.4) Depreciation expense and impairment losses (a) (6.1) Disposals and other decreases 0.3 Acquisitions and other increases (0.1) Transfers (b) 0.8 Accumulated depreciation and impairment at December 31, 2021 (12.3) Carrying amount at December 31, 2019 47.7 Carrying amount at December 31, 2020 43.8 Carrying amount at December 31, 2021 45.6 (a) In 2021, EUROAPI recognized an impairment loss of \u20ac2.0 milli on against a right-of-use asset relating to a commercial lease effective July 1, 2021. No impairment losses were r ecognized against right-of-use assets in the years ended December 31, 2020 and Decembe r 31, 2019. (b) This line mainly comprises assets brought into service dur ing the period. Assets brought into service, and the correspondin g depreciation expenses, represented immaterial amounts in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Leased assets mainly comprised office and industrial premises (92%) and the vehicle fleet (8%) as of December 31, 2021. Annual lease costs on short-term leases and low-value asset leases amounted to \u20ac1 .0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, \u20ac1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, and \u20ac1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Total cash outflows on leases (excluding annual lease co sts on short-term leases and low-value asset leases) amounted to \u20ac2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compar ed with \u20ac2.9 million in 2020 and \u20ac2.8 million in 2019. A maturity analysis of the lease li ability is disclosed in Note D.9.

D.4. Net deferred tax position An analysis of the net deferre d tax position is presented below: (\u20ac million) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Deferred tax assets 45.3 26.1 25.6 Deferred tax liabilities (5.6) (11.1) (10.2) Net deferred tax asset/(liability) 39.7 14.9 15.4 The table below provides an analysis of the net deferred tax position by source: (\u20ac million) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Deferred taxes on: Consolidation adjustments (intragroup margin in inventory) 0.8 0.2 0.2 245Provision for pensions and other employee benefits 24.8 24.7 20.8 Accrued expenses and provisions dedu ctible at the time of payment 8.3 8.3 7.9 Temporary differences on property, plant and equipment (1.6) (14.4) (12.1) Other 7.4 (4.0) (1.4) Net deferred tax asset/(liability) 39.7 14.9 15.4 (a) The increase in deferred tax assets in 2021 was due mainly to the Prior Reorganization Transactions, which resulted in the recognition of \u20ac5.3 million (\u20ac1.5 million in the United States, \u20ac3.8 million in Japan) in respect of deductible goodwill recognized by EUROAPI subsidiaries, plus \u20ac16.0 million of deferred tax liabilities on EU ROAPI activities in France rela ting to non-transferred tax ba ses. All of those items were treated as an equity transaction. As of December 31, 2021, unrecognized deferred tax assets, which mainly related to tax losses available for carry-forward, amounted to \u20ac0.9 million. Ther e were no unrecognized deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. D.5. Inventories Inventories comprise the following items: (\u20ac million) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Gross value Allowances Carrying amount Gross value Allowances Carrying amount Gross value Allowances Carrying amount Raw materials 99.0 (4.4) 94.5 109.8 (4.0) 105.7 receivable An allowance for impairment is ta ken against accounts receivable on an individual basis when a loss is regarded as probable based on an analysis conducted customer by customer. When an allowance is taken against accounts receivable, sales to customers presentin g a credit risk are halted until the customer returns to solvency, in accordance with IFRS 15. Accounts receivable (other than those arisi ng from sales to Sanofi) break down as follows: (\u20ac million) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Gross value (a) 241.2 198.0 205.0 Allowances (b) (2.3) (3.3) (0.6) Carrying amount 238.9 194.7 204.4 (a) The increase was mainly due to a higher level of amounts receivable from Sanofi. (b) As of December 31, 2021, two custom er accounts receivable were written down via impai rment allowances totaling \u20ac2.3 million, one in France (\u20ac1.4 million for a specific custom er of Francopia placed in administration) and the other in the United States (\u20ac0.9 million). The \u20ac3.3 million allowance as of December 31, 2020 relates to a customer in insolvency, and the allowances as of December 31, 2019 relate to individual customer accounts receivable. Trade accounts receivable resulting from sales to Sanofi are not subject to any risk of impairment. The table below shows the split of accounts receivabl e between third parties and related parties: (\u20ac million) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Accounts receivable - third parties 111.4 116.2 113.1 Accounts receivable - Carrying amount 238.9 194.7 204.4 246 Trade accounts receivable resulting from sales to Sa nofi are settled in accordance with the payment terms applied within the group, and show no arrears for any of the periods presented. Consequently, all of the amounts presented in the aging analysis provide d below relate solely to trade accounts receivable from third-party, non-Sanofi customers. An analysis of overdue accounts receivable by length of arrears is presented below: (a) The year-on-year change in overdue accoun ts receivable in 2021 was ma inly due to temporary payme nt delays as a result of the introduction of new payment flows following the reorganization. EUROAPI did not assign any trade accounts receivable in any of the periods presented. D.7.

(c) Transfers represent amounts reclassified to \"Other current liabilities\" during the period, wh ich in 2021 included environme ntal liabilities of \u20ac5.0 million. In addition, a pr ovision of \u20ac14.6 million (see Note C, \"Princi pal agreements\") was retained by Sanofi pursuant to the Prior Reorganization Transactions completed in France on October 1, 2021. Consequently, the \"Transfers\" line reflects the trans fer of this legacy liability to Sanofi, which wa s treated as a transaction between shareholders and reflected in equity. 249D.10.1. Provisions for pensions a nd other post-employment benefits EUROAPI offers its employees pension plans and othe r post-employment benefits. The specific features of the plans (benefit formulas, fund investment policy and fund assets he ld) vary depending on the applicable laws and regulations in each country where the employees work. These employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 (see Note B.18.). The provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits presented in the EUROAPI c onsolidated financial st atements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and D ecember 31, 2019 represent the rights vested in the employees who directly contributed to EUROAPI activities, whether or not they were transferred to EUROAPI when the asset and liability transfer took place as part of the reorganization of its activities in 2021. Pension obligations in the two principal countries represented approximately 95. 2% of the total value of the defined-benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021, compared with 94.6% as of December 31, 2020 and 94.1% as of December 31, 2019 and January 1, 2019. The principles of the main defined- benefit plans in those two countries are described below: France Lump-sum retirement benefit plans All EUROAPI employees working in France are entitled, under plans offered by Sanofi, to a lump-sum payment on retirement. The amount of that payment depends both on their length of service within the company and on the rights guaranteed by collective a nd internal agreements. The employee's final salary is used in calculating the amount of these lump-sum retirement benefits. These plans represent all of the obligations in France. Germany Top-up defined-benefit pension plans The benefits offered under this pension plan are w holly funded by the employer (there are no employee contributions) via a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA), under which benefits are estimated on the basis of a career average salary. Employees are entitled to receive an annuity u nder this plan if their salary exceeds the social security ceiling. The amount of the pe nsion is calculated by reference to a range of vesting rates corresponding to salary bands. The plan also includes disability and death benefits, and represents approximately 42% of th e total obligations in Germany. Sanofi-Aventis plus (SAV plus) This is a top-up plan that replaces the previous t op-up defined-benefit plan. New entrants joining the plan on or after April 1, 2015 contribute to a defined-contribution plan that is partially funded via the company's CTA. All employees whose salary exceeds the social securi ty ceiling are automatically covered by the plan. The employer's contribution is 15% of the amount by which the employee's salary exceeds the social security ceiling. Multi-employer plan (Pensionskasse) This is a defined-benefit plan treated as a define d-contribution plan, in acco rdance with the accounting policies described in Note B.18. Currently, contribut ions cover the level of annuities. Only the portion relating to the future revaluation of the annuities is included in the defined-be nefit pension obligation. The obligation relating to this re valuation amounted to \u20ac37.4 million as of December 31, 2021, versus \u20ac31.6 million as of December 31, 2020, \u20ac24. 8 million as of December 31, 2019. 250Actuarial assumptions used to me asure Sanofi's pension obligation An actuarial valuation of the obligation was perform ed with the assistance of independent actuaries as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The calculations were based on the follow ing financial and demographic assumptions: 2021 2020 2019 France Germany France Germany France Germany Discount rate (a)/(b) 0.10% to 2.25% 1.30% Retirement age 62 to 67 62 62 to 67 62 62 to 67 62 Mortality table TGH/ TGF 05 Heubeck RT TGH/ TGF 05 Heubeck RT 2018 G (a) Discount rates have been determined on the basis of market ra tes for first-class private corporate bonds whose duration is appr oximately equivalent to that of the plans' estimates of future payments. The benchmarks used are identical for all periods presented. (b) Rates according to durations, respectively from 0 to 7 years, from 7 to 10 years and more than 10 years.

This plan involved refocu sing development activities on large molecules, peptides and oligonucleotides, resulting in the closure of the pilot installations at Frankfurt. Re structuring provisions related to this re organization were \u20ac6.8 million as of December 31, 2019, \u20ac4.2 million as of December 31, 2020, an d \u20ac1.8 million as of December 31, 2021. The timing of future reversals of provisions as of December 31, 2021 was as follows: December 31, 2021 Total Reversals by period (\u20ac million) < 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years > 5 years Total provisions (a) 2.7 2.5 0.2 0.0 - - Germany (b) 1.8 1.6 0.2 - - - UK 0.4 0.4 - - - - France 0.4 0.4 - - - (a) Termination benefits represent 13.9% of the total provision for restructuring. (b) In 2021, termination benefits totaling \u20ac3. 1 million were paid in respect of the pl an initiated in Germany in 2014 (project F) and continued in 2017 (project IA), as described above. The timing of future reversals of provisions as of December 31, 2020 was as follows: December 31, 2020 Total Reversals by period (\u20ac million) < 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years > 5 years Total provisions (a) 5.6 5.5 0.1 - - - Germany (b) 4.2 4.1 0.1 - - - UK 1.0 1.0 - - - - France 0.4 0.4 - - - (a) Termination benefits represent 63.7% of the total provision for restructuring. (b) In 2020, termination benefits totaling \u20ac2. 7 million were paid in respect of the pl an initiated in Germany in 2014 (project F) and continued in 2017 (project IA), as described above. The timing of future reversals of provisions as of December 31, 2019 was as follows: December 31, 2019 Total Reversals by period (\u20ac million) < 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years > 5 years 255Total provisions (a) 8.8 5.4 3.3 0.1 - - Germany (b) 6.8 3.4 3.3 0.1 - - UK (c) 1.4 1.4 - - - - France 0.5 0.5 - - - (a) Termination benefits represent 73.5% of the total provision for restructuring. (b) This amount relates mainly to the cost of a restructuri ng of industrial development activ ities in Germany that was initiate d in 2014 (project F) and continued in 2017 (project IA). This plan involved refocusing development activities on large molecules, peptid es and oligonucleotides, resulting in the closure of the pilot installations at Frankfurt. (c) This amount relates mainly to the cost of a restructuri ng of industrial development activities at the Haverhill site in the UK that took place in 2019. D.11. Other non-current liabilities Other non-current liabilities include non-current liabilities related to taxes and duties other than income taxes. The amount of other non-current liabilities was im material as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. D.12. Accounts payable Accounts payable break down as follows: (\u20ac million) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Third-party accounts payable (a) 119.1 95.9 83.3 Related-party accounts 70.5 35.2 37.1 amount 189.6 131.1 120.4 (a) The increase in third-party accounts payable as of December 31, 2021 is mainly due to temporary payment delays as a result of the installation of the new IT systems that were required in connection with the Prior Reorganization Transactions. (b) The increase in accounts payable to Sanofi mainly reflects a rise in the liab ilities of Francopia further to the inception of a new subcontracting agreement (see Note C, \"Pri ncipal agreements\"), plus te mporary payment delays related to the Prior Reorganizatio n Transactions of October 1, 2021. 256D.13. Other current liabilities Other current liabilities break down as follows: (\u20ac million) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Customer contract liabilities (see Note D.8.) 10.4 13.1 9.0 Current income tax liabilities 7.7 0.4 2.4 Taxes and duties payable, other than income taxes 6.2 0.6 2.6 Employee-related liabilities 50.8 45.9 45.0 Restructuring provisions (see Note D.10.2.) 2.5 5.6 5.4 Amounts payable for acquisitions of non-current assets (a) 63.1 25.2 18.5 Other current liabilities (b) 17.5 8.9 10.7 Other payables - related parties (Note D.22.) (c) 34.5 76.6 52.0 Total (a) 192.7 176.3 145.7 (a) The increase in this item as of December 31, 2021 is mainly due to the acquisition of \u20ac22. 5 million of software and IT infr astructure (see Note D.3.). (b) As of December 31, 2021, this line includes the current porti on of the environmental provisi on for non-operational sites, \u20ac 5.0 million of which was reclassified to \"Non-current liabilities\", further to the indemnification agreement with Sanofi (see Note C, \"Princip al agreements\"). (c) The decrease in 2021 is mainly explain ed by the extinguishment of the purchase co mmitment recorded in \"Other current liabil ities\"; (corresponding to Francopia alkaloid-based ra w materials held by Sanofi and amounting to \u20ac27.7 million) further to implementati on of the subcontracting agreement effective October 1, 2021. D.14. Personnel costs Total personnel costs (other than termination benefits, presented in Note D.18.) in clude the following items: (\u20ac million) 2021 Salaries 166.1 159.5 Social security charges 61.8 57.6 57.4 Defined-benefit plans, and voluntary a nd statutory profit-sharing schemes. (a) 18.7 18.2 18.5 Share-based payment 1.8 1.6 1.4 Other employee benefits 15.5 14.4 14.2 Total 274.6 257.9 251.1 (a) This line includes the impact of the April 2021 IFRIC agenda d ecision on the attribution of be nefits to periods of service (see Note B.2.1.). D.15. Research and development expenses Research and development (R&D) expenses mainly comprise primary expenditures incurred by EUROAPI development platforms relating to in-hous e projects to develop new products and services or to improve existing products and services befo re they move into industrial operation. (\u20ac million) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Research and deve lopment expenses (17.0) (19.9) (16.3) Research and development expenses (17.0) (19.9) (16.3) D.16. Other operating income Other operating income amounted to \u20ac4.2 million in 2021, co mprising (i) \u20ac2.9 million of indemnities receivable in respect of certain short-term empl oyee benefit liabilities owed by Sanofi under the terms of the Master Carve Out Agreement of October 1, 202 1 (see Note A.2.) and (ii) a foreign exchange gain of \u20ac1.3 million. Net foreign exchange gains amounted to \u20ac1.3 million in 2020 and \u20ac1.4 million in 2019. 257D.17. Other operating expenses Other operating expenses were \u20ac5.4 million in 2021, \u20ac10.6 millio n in 2020, and \u20ac8.8 million in 2019. For 2021, this line item mainly comprised an impa irment allowance of \u20ac2.0 million taken against a commercial lease (see Note D.2.2.) that is effec tive from July 1, 2021 but has not been used, and a charge of \u20ac2.4 million to provisions for environmental risks at non-ope rational sites (mainly parcels of land at Vertolaye in France, see Note D.10.). For 2020, this line item includes an expense of \u20ac9.8 million relating to impairment losses on industrial property, plant and equipment not brought into ser vice following a management decision to discontinue the plan to make the industrial site at Frankf urt (Germany) a secondary manufacturing site for the production of phospholipids, an active ingredient u sed in Essentiale (a product supplied to Sanofi's Consumer Healthcare business). That decision was take n mainly in response to a decrease in volumes sold in the product's main mark ets, such as China and Russia. For 2019, this line item includes an expense of \u20ac9. 0 million relating to a provision for environmental risks, mainly on sites in France no longer used for operations. D.18. Restructuring costs and similar items Restructuring costs and similar items represent the share of restructuring costs incurred by Sanofi attributable to EUROAPI's ope rations and support functions. Restructuring costs and similar items breaks down as follows: (\u20ac million) 2021 2020 2019 Employee-related expenses (a) 0.3 (15.8) (1.2) Charges, gains or losses on assets (b) (8.9) 13.4 1.3 Other restructuring costs (c) (4.7) - - Total (13.4) (2.4) 0.1 (a) For 2021, this line item comprises a reversal of \u20ac0.3 million in the UK. That compares with an expense of \u20ac13.3 million in 2020, mainly on termination benefits further to the announcement of the \"Pla y to Win\" plan to adapt Sanofi's organization in line with strat egic changes (see Note C), most of which was for French entities included in the scope of consolid ation. An amount of \u20ac4.5 million was charg ed to a provision for liabilities associated with strenuous jobs in France. (b) For 2021, this line includes \u20ac8.9 million of impairment losses taken against assets in connection with the reorientation of EUROAPI activities in Italy (see Note D.2.1.). For 2020, this line mainly comprises a reversal of an unused allowance of \u20ac13.7 million against UCI inventories at French sites; for 2019, it comprises a reversal of \u20ac1.3 million followi ng the return to service of a previously written-down item of property, plant and equipment. The UCI (Universal Corticosteroid Intermediate) proj ect is a proposal to develop a new cell-culture based hydrocortisone manufacturing pro cess at the Elbeuf site in France. In 2017, it became clear that (i) yields were well below expectations and (ii) rival products were becoming much more co mpetitively priced. Consequently, it was decided to make a strat egic withdrawal from the project; this led to write-downs of dedicated assets, and also of some of the inventories produced using th e new process (given sales projections for the volu mes held in inventory) in order to cover the risk that they would not be sold. In 2020, the company identified new market opportunities, arising from longer-than-exp ected regulatory delays for customers adopting the new strain. Consequently, it was possible to reverse most of the allowan ce for unsold inventories, taking account of the updated inventory runoff forecasts based on management's latest asse ssment, reflecting events and circumstances known at that date. During 2021, the inv entories were run off in line with the revised projections from 20 20, so no further adjustment was made to the allowance. (c) This line includes the impacts of the temporary shutdown of the Brindisi site (\u20ac4.0 million, including accelerated deprecia tion of \u20ac1.2 million) as a result of the reorienta tion plan initiated at the end of 2021, and an additional charge to the \"Project F\" p rovision in Germany (\u20ac0.7 million). D.19.

That impact was not material to th e EUROAPI financial statements as of December 31, 2021, 2020 or 20 19. D.20. Income taxes Income taxes breaks down as follows: (\u20ac million) 2021 2020 2019 Income/(loss) before taxes (14.6) (11.8) (3.1) Current taxes (18.3) (11.2) (15.2) Deferred taxes 17.1 16.7 20.8 Total (1.2) 5.5 5.6 259 The difference between the effective tax rate and the standard corporate income tax rate applicable in France is explained as follows: 2021 2020 2019 as a % \u20ac million as a % \u20ac million as a % \u20ac million Standard tax rate applicable in France 28.4% 4.2 32.0% 3.8 34.4% 1.1 Difference between the standard French tax rate and the rates applicable to EUROAPI (a) 2.7 1.7 3.9 Rate differential between current taxes and deferred taxes (2.5) (5.3) (5.5) Other corporate taxes (b) 5.2 7.0 9.4 Revisions to tax exposur es and settlements of tax disputes - - (0.1) Tax incentives for investment in France 0.8 1.3 1.4 Non-deductible expenses (0.5) (0.2) (0.6) Other (c) (8.4) (1.1) - Effective tax rate (8.1)% (1.2) 46.4% 5.5 180.4% 5.6 (a) This amount mainly comprises the cont ribution to EUROAPI taxable results from profit-making countries (including Hungary an d the UK ) where tax rates are lower than in France. EUROAPI has no ope rations in countries with a higher tax rate than France. (b) This amount includes the effects of taxes other than in come taxes, in particular CVAE in France and IRAP in Italy. (c) This line mainly consists of the ta x effects of indemnification against environm ental liabilities (see Note C, \"Principal a greements\"). D.21. Consolidated equity Shareholders' equity stood at \u20ac1,011.4 million as of December 31, 2021; \u20ac989.3 million as of December 31, 2020; and \u20ac1,018.1 milli on as of December 31, 2019. D.21.1 Share capital and share premium In 2020, Sanofi carried out an equity injection when EUROAPI was formed, comprising 150,000 \u20ac1 par value ordinary shares and amounting to \u20ac150,000. In 2021, EUROAPI carried out a capital increase via th e issuance of 89,850,000 \u20ac1 par value ordinary shares, raising a total subscription of \u20ac1,868,000,000, in order to finance the acquisitions of those of its subsidiaries that were owned by Sanofi subsidiaries, thereby enabling the EUROAPI group to be legally constituted. Following that share issuance, EUROAPI had a balance of \u20ac1,778.2 million in its share premium account. Given the continuity of control exercised by Sanofi dur ing all the periods presented, in applying IFRS 10 EUROAPI elected retrospective recognition of the le gal reorganization of 2021, as discussed in Note A.2. above. The capital increase carried out as c onsideration for the asset transfers/divestments completed as part of the legal reorganization is acc ounted for as though it had taken place on January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, the share capital of EUROAPI amounted to \u20ac90,000,000, consisting of 90,000,000 \u20ac1 par value ordinary shares, all fully paid. 260The table below shows movements in the share cap ital of EUROAPI for all of the periods presented: (\u20ac million) Number of shares (million) % of share capital for the period December 31, 2021 90.0 100.0 December 31, 2020 90.0 100.0 January 1, 2019 89.9 100.0 D.21.2. Number of shares used to calculate earnings per share The number of shares used to calculate earnings pe r share is the number of shares constituting the company's share capital subsequent to the capital in crease described above (see Note D.21.1.). That number of shares was used for all the periods presente d, given that this transaction was accounted for retrospectively as of January 1, 2019 (see Note A.2.). In the absence of any potentially d ilutive instruments outstanding as of December 31, the number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per shar e is the same as the number of shares in issue. D.21.3 Currency translation differences Cumulative currency translation differences amount ed to \u20ac16.6 million as of December 31, 2021; \u20ac(14.3) million as of December 31, 2020; and \u20ac9.8 million as of December 31, 2019. D.22. Related party transactions D.22.1. Related party transactions of an operational nature The principal transactions between EUROAPI and Sanofi are: - sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients to Sa nofi for use in the production of medicines sold by Sanofi; - purchases of active pharmaceutical ingredients produced by Sanofi and distributed by EUROAPI; - purchases of opiate-based active ingredients ma nufactured by Sanofi at its Aramon site; and - production and development ser vices provided by Sanofi to EUROAPI, or by EUROAPI to Sanofi. (\u20ac million) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Net sales 407.0 453.9 448.1 Purchases (140.0) (187.9) (172.6) Research and development expenses (2.0) (0.7) (2.7) Administrative and general expenses (a) (22.6) (32.2) (28.4) Financial income/(expenses) (0.2) (0.7) 0.1 (a) Administrative and general services include shared activities a llocated to EUROAPI (see Note A.3.2.). These expenses origin ate from various organizations within the Sanofi group such as senior management, industrial affairs, central support functions, and fun ctions housed within the legal entities before the Prior Reorganization Transactions. (\u20ac million) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Accounts receivable (Note D.6.) 127.6 78.5 91.4 Accounts payable (Note D.12.)

(b) This corresponds to the amount receivabl e by EUROAPI in respect of the indemnity provided by Sanofi against environmental l iabilities arising on non-operational sites (see Note C, \"Principal agreements\"). (c) This amount includes the current por tion (\u20ac5.0 million) of the indemnity provid ed by Sanofi against environmental liabiliti es arising on non-operational sites (see Note C, \"Princ ipal agreements\"), and a \u20ac12.6 million VAT cr edit outstanding as of December 31, 2021 generated by new subcontracting transac tion flows with Sanofi effective October 1, 2021 and the resulting raw materials purchas es. (d) Includes amounts payable to Sanofi for acquisitio ns of non-current assets (see Note D.13.). (e) These amounts represent the net year-end balance on cash pooling arrangements for legal entities exclusively carrying on EU ROAPI activities (see Note G) that are parties to the Sanofi cash pooling agreement. Asset and liability positions vis- \u00e0-vis Sanofi that pre-dated completion of the Prior Reorganization Transactions of 2021 were closed out, which explains the bulk of the decrease in 2021 re lative to 2020. D.22.2. Transactions connected with legal reorganizations A description of the Prior Reorganization Transactions is provided in Note G. D.22.3. Compensation of key executives The table below breaks down by type the compensation of key executives: (\u20ac million) 2021 2020 2019 Short-term benefits 5.2 4.6 4.0 Post-employment benefits (a) 0.3 0.2 0.2 Share-based payment 1.0 0.9 0.8 Total recognized in profit or loss 6.5 5.7 5.0 (a) This amount relates to lump-sum retir ement benefits, which as of December 31, 2021 represented a cumulative obligation of \u20ac 1 million for key executives in post as of that date (members of the EUROAPI Executive Committee).

D.24. Legal and arbitral proceedings EUROAPI and other Group companies are involved in l itigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings. Those proceedings typically relate to commercial, employee-related and ta x matters, and to waste disposal and pollution claims. Provisions related to legal and arbitral proceedings are recorded in accordance with the principles described in Note B.10. Assessing the risks involved involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Those assessments are based on estimates and assumptions th at have been deemed reasonable by management. EUROAPI believes that the aggregate provisions reco rded for the above matters are adequate based upon currently available informati on. However, given the inherent uncertainties related to these cases and involved in estimating contingent liabilities, EU ROAPI cannot rule out that future decisions may have a material adverse effect on its net income. As of December 31, 2021, EUROAPI was subject to two ongoing claims: (i) a commercial claim made during the year in Japan; and (ii) developments in employee-related litigation in Italy dating from June 2010, following notification of a civil claim for damages by the service-provider. D.25. Segment information D.25.1 General information Segment information is prepared on the basis of information communicated to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CEO, who has been designate d as the chief operating decision maker (CODM) of EUROAPI in accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segm ents), makes decisions on EUROAPI's strategic orientations and on the allocation of resources. EUROAPI has identified a single operating segment that meets the IFRS 8 criteria. Reporting a single segment is consistent with the EUROAPI group's transverse structure and governance arrangements; it reflects the level at whic h strategic and operational decisions are made, budgetary planning and resource allocations carried out, and performances measured on the basis of information provided regularly to the CODM. D.25.2 Segment results The table below sets forth the operating results of the EUROAPI group's operating segment, including central support function costs. The accounting polici es applied to operating segments are based on the same accounting policies as are used in prepar ing the consolidated financial statements. EUROAPI measures the operating performance of its operating segment on the basis of \"Core EBITDA\", the key internal performance indicator monitored by the Group. Core EBITDA is determined by adding the following items back to operating income or loss determined under IFRS: (i) depreciation and amortization expense (see Note B.5.); (ii) impairment losses charged against intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, net of reversals (see Note B.6.); (iii) restructuring costs and similar items (see Note B.15.); (iv) charges to provisions for environmental risks, net of reversals of unused provisions (see No te B.10.); and (v) any other amounts relating to other items regarded as unusual in nature or size. A reconciliation of \"Core EBITDA\" to Operating income/(loss) is shown below: (\u20ac million) 2021 2020 2019 Operating income/(loss) (EBIT) (12.8) (10.8) (0.5) (+) Depreciation, amortization and 76.0 72.2 58.6 61.3 58.1 (+) Restructuring costs and similar items excluding depreciation, amortization and impairment (Note D.18.) 3.3 2.1 1.2 (+) Increase in provisions for environmental risks, net of reversals of unused provisions (Note D.10.) 3.1 3.8 12.4 (+) Other (b) 2.6 - - Core EBITDA 72.2 67.2 71.7 (a) As shown in the line item \"Depreciation, amortization and impai rment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets an d right-of- use assets\" in the stat ement of cash flows. (b) This line includes charges to provisions for risks relati ng to (i) an ongoing legal claim (\u20ac0.9 million) and (ii) a commerc ial lease (\u20ac1.7 million) which was also subject to an impairment loss taken against right-of-use assets (see Note D.2.2.).

The contribution from Sanofi reflect s the historical links between the manufacturing operations of EUROAPI and the internal manufacturing needs of Sanofi. No other customer represents a significant proportion of EUROAPI's total net sales. 266D.26. Financial risk management D.26.1. Foreign exchange risk The EUROAPI group operates internationally, in over 80 countries. Group entities are exposed to foreign exchange risk when they enter into tran sactions in a currency other than their functional currency. Management of exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, in cluding currency hedging policies, are centralized within EUROAPI's finance teams. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. The principal currencies other than the euro in which transactions are denominated are the US dollar (USD), Hungarian forint (HUF), pound sterling (GBP) and Japanese yen (JPY). An analysis of the sensitivity of operating income/loss and equity to exchange rate fluc tuations is presented in section 3.4.1 of the Prospectus. D.26.2. Interest rate risk The EUROAPI group has no exposure to interest rate risk because it has no floating-rate debt or debt instruments. After the transaction date, EUROAPI may contract appropriate hedging inst ruments aligned on its fixed/floating rate split objectives. D.26.3. Liquidity risk The EUROAPI group is financed via the Sanofi cash pooling agreement, which centralizes EUROAPI's liquidity on the terms and conditions applied within the Sanofi group. As of December 31, 2021, EUROAPI had a net asset position of \u20ac10.9 million vis-\u00e0-vis Sanofi via the cash pool. The cash pooling agreement with Sanofi will be terminated prior to the initial public offering. The EUROAPI group has set up an internal cash poo ling arrangement between the parent company and its subsidiaries to centralize the Group's liquidity. E. Events subsequent to December 31 On January 25, 2022, EUROAPI announced a reorganization and transformation plan in Italy as part of the Group's business reorientation program, focusi ng in particular on CDMO operations and on transforming the portfolio of tuberculosis treat ments. That plan was accompanied by collective agreements and voluntary redundancies affecti ng certain positions at the Brindisi site. In connection with the proposed initial public offeri ng, EUROAPI is about to enter into a \u20ac451 million revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, expiring on Febr uary 26, 2027. EUROAPI will be able to draw down on the facility as from th e date of initial listing of EUROAPI shares on the Euronext Paris regulated market. Apart from the events described above, no significant events occurred between the end of the reporting period and the date on which the consolidated financial statements were closed off. 267F.

(b) Entities in this category are Sanofi group subsidiaries that exclusively carry on dedicated EUROAPI activities, the entire share capital of which was transferred to EUROAPI as part of the Prior Reorganization Transactions of 2021 (see Note G.). (c) Sanofi subsidiaries included in the scope of combina tion before the Prior Reorganization Transactions of 2021. There were no changes in scope during any of the periods presented (see Note D.1.). 269G. Prior Reorganization Transactions The EUROAPI activities involved in the initial public offering were combined during 2021 within separate, standalone legal entities on completion of the Prior Reorganization Transactions initiated by Sanofi to form the EUROAPI group. The effect of the Prior Reorganization Transactions was to transfer all of the assets and liabilities attributable to EUROAPI activities. On completion of those transactions, the EUROAPI gr oup will consist of standalone subsidiaries 100% owned by the parent entity EUROAPI, which in turn will be owned by a subsidia ry of the Sanofi group (Sanofi Aventis Participations). The Prior Reorganization Transactions implemented by Sanofi for the purposes of the spin-out were carried out by means of transfers and divestment s between legal entities under common control. Those transactions alter neither the substance nor the economic interests of the activities concerned as presented before the Prior Reorganization Transacti ons (business combinations under common control). Consequently, the transfers and divestments were accounted for using the historical carrying amount method. The assets and liabilities transferred reflect the historical carrying amounts as valued in the financial statements before the reorganizations of 2021. The other assets and liabilities that were recorded in the statement of financial position be fore the Prior Reorganization Transactions but that were not transferred and were not included in the tr ansfer agreement were netted off and the balance taken to equity. 270The Sanofi group subsidiaries involved in the Prior Reorganization Transactions, and which constituted the historical scope of combination of EUROAPI be fore the full completion of the Prior Reorganization Transactions in 2021, are identified below: Sanofi entity included in the scope of combination Country of incorporation Activity Legal reorganization Sanofi Winthrop Industrie (a) France Distribution (purchase/resale) Transfer of certain assets and liabilities to EUROAPI France (c) in exchange for cash (b) Sanofi-Aventis Groupe (a) France Support functions Transfer of certain liabilities to EUROAPI France (c) in exchange for cash (b) Sanofi Chimie (a) France Industrial and commercial operations Transfer of certain assets and liabilities to EUROAPI France (c) in exchange for issuance of sh ares, with those shares then transferred to EUROAPI (b) Francopia (a) France Commercial subsidiary Divestment of 100% of the entity's shares and net assets to EUROAPI (b) Chinoin Private Co.

Report of the statutory auditors 27219.2 Interim and other financial information Not applicable. 19.3 Audit of historical annual financial information Financial years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 This is a translation into English of a report issu ed in French and it is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking users. This report should be read in conjunction with, an d construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. Statutory auditor's report on the consolidated financial statements To the President, In our capacity as statutory auditor of EUROAPI a nd in accordance with your request in connection with regulation (EU) No 2017/1129 supplemented by Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2019/980 in the framework of a initial public offering project on the re gulated market of Euronext Paris, we hereby report to you on the audit of the accompanying conso lidated financial statements of EUROAPI, in accordance with the accounting rules and principles applicable in IFRS as adopted by the European Union for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. Due to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemi c, the consolidated financial statements of these periods have been prepared and audited under specifi c conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of san itary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and thei r financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measur es, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organi zation and the performance of the audits. These consolidated financial statements were prep ared under your responsibility on February 8, 2022. Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with profe ssional standards applicable in France and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors ( Compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes ) relating to this engagement. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance abou t whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit invol ves performing procedures, by audit sampling and other means of testing, to obtain audit evidence a bout the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evalua ting the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We belie ve that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and financial position of the consolidated gr oup and the results of its operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, in acco rdance with the accounting rules and principles applicable in IFRS as adopted by the European Union. 273Without modifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the matter disclosed in Note A \"Basis of preparation of the financial statements\" to the c onsolidated financial statements which presents the consolidation perimeter and the guidelines related to the preparation of these consolidated financial statements where the main principles applied by the Company are described including the allocation principles used when applicable.

The internal rules shall enter into effect as of th e admission to trading of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. In addition to the provisions governing the Board of Directors cited above, these rules specify the organizational and op erational mode, the expertise and powers of the committees that the Board of Director s has established (see Section 15.3 \" Committees of the Board of Directors \" of the Prospectus). (a) Board of Directors (Articles 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17 of the articles of association and internal rules) Composition The Company is administered by a Board of Directors composed of at least three and no more than 18 members elected by the ordinary shareholders' meeting pursuant to and subject to exceptions provided for by law. The Board of Directors ensures that at least half of the members of the Board of Directors, at least two- thirds of the members of the audit committee and the ESG committee, and more than half of the members of the nominations and compensation committee are independent. The directors representing the employees are not includ ed in establishing the percentage of independent members. Upon the appointment of a member of the Board of Dir ectors, and at least once a year, preferably at the first meeting after the end of the Company's fina ncial year, the Board of Directors conducts an assessment of the independence of each of its me mbers (or candidates). During this assessment, the Board of Directors reviews the situation of the me mber or candidate on the basis of the criteria for independence, specific circumstances and the situation of the interested party in relation to the Company, as well as the member's expertise, in order to determ ine whether it is adequate for the Board's missions, and whether it complements the expertise of the ot her members of the Board. The shareholders are informed of the conclusions of this review in the corporate governance reports and, if applicable, at the shareholders' meeting during the election of members of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors and the shareholders' mee ting may name up to two non-voting members. The non-voting members may be individuals or legal entiti es, freely selected due to their expertise, from 279among or outside the shareholders. They are named fo r a period of two years and may be re-appointed. The Board of Directors may remunerate the non- voting members by drawing from the amount of the remuneration allocated to the directors by the sh areholders' meeting. Non-voting members study the issues that the Board of Directors or its Chair s ubmits for their review and opinion. The non-voting members attend the meetings of the Board of Directors and participate in deliberations, with an advisory voice only; however, their absence cannot affect the validity of the deliberations. Designation Directors are elected, renewed or dismissed under th e conditions provided by th e laws and regulations in force and stipulated by the articles of association. Each member of the Board of Directors must own at least 500 shares during the entire duration of the member's term of office and, in any case, within six months after his appointment takes effect. This obligation does not apply to the director representing the Group's employees or, on a decision by the Board, to directors representing shareholders who se internal procedures prohibit direct ownership of shares by their representatives. Directors are elected for four-year te rms. As an exception, the term of office of certain directors may be shorter under the following conditions: for the sole purpose of implementing or maintaini ng the rotation of the terms of directors, if possible, by thirds every year, the ordinary shareholders' meeting may elect one or more directors to a term of one (1) year, two (2) years or three (3) years; in order to be able to take into account the el ections of the social perimeter, which will take place at the end of 2023, the first term of office of the first director representing the employees will be for two (2) years; in the absence of a European CSE, the sec ond director representing the employees as designated in article 12.3 is appointed for a period of one (1) year, renewable, as long as a European CSE has not been set up. The term of office of the directors may be renewed. They may be dismissed at any time by the ordinary shareholders' meeting. The number of directors over the age of 70 may not exceed one-third of the directors on the Board, who are also subject to the laws and regulations that govern the plurality of offices held. Identity of directors Directors may be individuals or legal entities. Wh en elected, any legal entity must designate an individual as its permanent representative on the Board of Directors. The term of office of the permanent representative is the same as the term of the legal entity that the individual represents. When the legal entity dismisses its permanent representative, it must immediately name a replacement. The same provisions apply in the event of the deat h or resignation of the permanent representative. Directors representing the employees The Board of Directors includes one director who re presents the employees. This director is appointed pursuant to Article L. 225-27-1 III, 3\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ). 280When the number of members of the Board of Dir ectors exceeds the number of directors mentioned in the first paragraph of article L. 225-27-1 II of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), and provided that this criterion is still met on the da te of appointment, a second director representing the employees is appointed by the European CSE, in accordance with Article L. 225-27-1, III, 4\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ). In the absence of an European CSE, the second director representing the employees is appointed under the same conditions as those provided for the first director. Directors representing the employees are named for a period of four years, which expires at the end of the annual shareholders' meeting approving the financia l statements for the previous year and held in the year in which the term of office expires. The te rm of office of directors representing the employees may be renewed.

The Board of Directors may also name a Vice- Chair from among Board members, who replaces the Chair in the event of absence, temporary inability to serve, resignation, death or non-renewal of the Chair's term. In the case of a temporary inability, this replacement is valid for the limited period of the inability; in all other cases, it is valid until the election of the new Chair. The Chair is named for a term that may not exceed the Chair's term as director. The Chair may be re- elected indefinitely, subject to the aforementione d provision on the age limit. The Chair may be dismissed at any time by the Board of Directors. The Chairman's remuneration is set by the Boar d after consultation with the nominations and compensation committee.

The minutes of the meeting indicate the participati on of Board members via video-conference or telecommunications.

(b) Executive Management (Article 16 of the articles of association) Conditions and procedures The management of the company is assumed, under hi s or her responsibility, either by the Chair of the Board of Directors or by another individual appoint ed by the Board from among or outside its members, who holds the title of Chief Executive Officer. On a simple resolution adopted by a majority of th e votes of the directors present or represented, the Board of Directors chooses between the two form s of executive management. The shareholders and third parties are informed of this choi ce under the legal and regulatory conditions. The Board of Directors' decision remains in force un til a contrary decision is made by the Board or, at the Board's choice, for the duration of the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer. When the executive management of the Company is performed by the Chair of the Board of Directors, the following provisions on the Chief Executive Officer shall apply to the Chair. In this case, this person carries the title of both Chair and Chief Executive Officer. Deputy executive management On the recommendation of the Chief Executive Of ficer, the Board of Directors may appoint, from among or outside its members, one or more indi viduals charged with assisting the Chief Executive Officer, who shall have the title of Deputy Chief Executive Officer. 284There may be no more than five Deputy Chief Executive Officers. Age limit - Duration of duties The Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Ex ecutive Officers may not be older than 65 years of age. The duration of the term of the Chief Executive O fficer or of a Deputy Chief Executive Officer is determined at the time they are appointed, but this duration may not exceed the duration of their office as director, if applicable. Dismissal The Chief Executive Officer may be dismissed at any time by the Board of Directors. This is also true for the Deputy Chief Executive Officers, on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer. If dismissal is decided without grounds, it may result in damages, except when the Chief Executive Officer is also the Chair of the Board of Directors. When the Chief Executive Officer ceases to, or is prevented from, performing the CEO's duties, the Deputy Chief Executive Officers retain their duties and powers, unless decided otherwise by the Board, until the appointment of the new Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors determines the remunerati on of the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officers. Powers of the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officers The Chief Executive Officer is vested with the most extensive powers to act in any circumstance in the name of the Company. The Chief Executive Office r exercises these powers within the limits of the corporate purpose, and subject to those powers expressl y granted by law to shareholders' meetings and to the Board of Directors, as well as the limits stipulat ed by the internal rules of the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive Officer represents the Company in its relations with third parties. The Company is committed even by the acts of the Chief Executive Offi cer that do not fall within the corporate purpose, unless the Company proves that the third party knew that the act exceeded this pu rpose or that the third party could not have been unaware of this give n the circumstances; publication of the articles of association is not in and of itself sufficient to constitute this proof. Decisions of the Board of Directors that lim it the powers of the Chief Executive Officer are unenforceable against third parties. In agreement with the Chief Execu tive Officer, the Board of Directors determines the scope and duration of the powers granted to Deputy Chief Executive Offi cers. With respect to third parties, the Deputy Chief Executive Officers have the same powers as the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer or the Deputy Chief Ex ecutive Officers may, within the limits set by the laws in force, delegate the powers they deem appr opriate, for one or more specific purposes, to any and all agents, even outside the Company, considered i ndividually or together in a committee or commission, with or without the option of substitution, subject to the limitations provided by law. Such powers may be permanent or temporary and carry the option of substitution. Delegati ons granted in this way retain their effects despite the expiration of th e duties of the person who conferred them. 28520.2.3 Rights, privileges and restrictions attached to the shares (Articles 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the articles of association) Fully paid-up shares are in register ed or bearer form, at the discretion of the shareholder, under the conditions provided by the regulations in force. Each share gives a right, in the ownership of corporat e assets, in the distribution of profits and in the liquidation dividend, to a fraction proportional to th e number and nominal value of the existing shares. In addition, each share gives the right to a vote a nd to representation at shareholders' meetings, under the conditions of law and the articles of association. The double voting right provided in Article L. 22- 10-46 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) is expressly eliminated by the articles of association. Shareholders bear losses only in the amount of their contributions. The rights and obligations attached to a share follo w the share into any hand s into which its passes. Ownership of a share automatically carries full adheren ce to the articles of association and the decisions of the shareholders' meetings. Every time that it is necessary to own several shar es or securities in order to exercise any right, shareholders and holders of securities are personally responsible for grouping the number of shares or securities necessary. Shares are indivisible with regard to the Company. Co-owners of undivided shares are repr esented in shareholders' meetings by one of the owners or by a single agent. In the event of a disag reement, the agent is designated by the court at the request of the more diligent co-owners. If the shares carry beneficial ownership, the regist ration of the shares in an account must show the existence of the beneficial ownership. Except wher e otherwise agreed and notified to the Company by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, the right to vote belongs to the beneficial owner in ordinary shareholders' meetings, and to the bare owner in extraordinary shareholders' meetings. Registered or bearer shares are freely negotiable, unless otherwise required by laws or regulations. Shares are registered in an account a nd the sale of shares, with respect to the Company and third parties, is made by transfer from account to account under th e conditions and procedures defined by the laws and regulations in force. 20.2.4 Change in capital and the ri ghts attached to the shares As the articles of association do not stipulate any specific provision, the modification of the rights attached to the shares is governed by the law. 20.2.5 Shareholders' meetings (Articles 21, 22, 23 and 24 of the articles of association) Notice of meeting and meeting location Shareholders' meetings are called under the conditions, in the forms and with the deadlines provided by the laws and regulations in force.

MATERIAL CONTRACTS The material contracts signed by the companies of the Group outside the normal course of business in the past two years are presented in Section 9.2.2(a) \" RCF Loan Agreement \" and Chapter 18 \" Related- party transactions \" (with the exception of Sections 18.3.3 \" Distribution agreements for certain APIs \", 18.3.5 \" License agreements \" and 18.4 \" Other relationships with related parties \") of the Prospectus. 29022. INFORMATION RELATING TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S SHARES AND TO THE COMPANY'S SHARES 22.1 Terms and conditions of the Distribution in Kind The Company's initial listing is part of Sanofi's \"Pla y to Win\" simplification project. Its purpose is to create the conditions for EUROAPI to enhance its stat us as a partner of choice for all pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and to achieve greater independence and visibility in order to become a global leader in the production of APIs. The distribution by Sanofi to its shareholders (other than Sanofi itself and holders of shares issued upon the exercise of Sanofi stock options since January 1, 2022) of the Company's shares will take the form of a dividend in kind at the ratio of one (1) EUROAPI share per twenty-three (23) Sanofi shares (the \"Distribution in Kind\"). The Distribution in Kind will be submitted for approv al to the combined annual shareholders' meeting of Sanofi to be held on May 3, 2022. Sanofi's share holders (ruling in an ordinary manner) will thus be asked to approve the payment of an ordinary di vidend in cash of \u20ac3.33 per share (i.e., a total of \u20ac4,070,763,885.50) (the \"Ordinary Dividend\") as well as the Distribution in Kind. The Distribution in Kind will be carried out subject to the approval by th at same meeting (ruling in an extraordinary manner) of amendments to Sanofi's articles of association to introduce the ability for the shareholders' meeting to decide, for all or part of a dividend distributio n (or distribution of other interim dividends, reserves or premiums, etc.), that this distribution be ma de in kind through the delivery of company assets, including financial securities, with or without cash options. 22.1.1 Provisional calendar for the Distribution in Kind March 25, 2022 Publication in the French Journal of Mandatory Legal Notices ( Bulletin des annonces l\u00e9gales obligatoires \"BALO\") of the notice of the Sanofi's combined annual shareholders' meeting. March 30, 2022 Decision of the sole shareholder to transform the Company into a French public limited company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme ) subject to the condition precedent of a positive vote by Sanofi shareholders on the Distribution in Kind. March 31, 2022 AMF visa on the Prospectus. April 1, 2022 Sanofi's Capital Markets Day dedicated to the Company. April 11, 2022 Publication in the BALO of the no tice of Sanofi's combined annual shareholders' meeting. April 29, 2022 Publication by Euronext Paris of a notice concerning the Distribution in Kind. Publication by Euronext Paris of a notice concerning the admission of EUROAPI shares. May 3, 2022 Sanofi's combined annual shareholders' meeting. May 5, 2022 Publication by Euronext Paris of a no tice concerning the technical reference price of EUROAPI shares. May 6, 2022 Ex-dividend date of the Sanofi ordinary dividend in cash and dividend in kind (the \"Ex-Dividend Date\"). Delivery of the EUROAPI shares allocat ed as a dividend in kind to the Centralizing Agent (as defined below). Admission of EUROAPI shares to tr ading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. May 9, 2022 Date of identification of shareholders eligible to receive the Distribution in Kind (record date) taking into account the orders ex ecuted until May 5, 2022, included. 291May 10, 2022 Payment of the Ordinary Dividend. Payment of the Distribution in Kind (delivery and registration of the EUROAPI shares allocated in respect of the Distribution in Kind). June 17, 2022 Settlement and delivery of the EUROAPI sh ares sold by Sanofi in connection with the Investment. 22.1.2 Allocation of EUROAPI shares to Sanofi's shareholders 54,420,337 Company shares, representing approximate ly 58% of the Company's share capital, will be distributed by Sanofi to its shareholders (other than Sanofi itself and holders of shares issued upon the exercise of Sanofi stock options since January 1, 2022) pro rata to their equity interest in Sanofi's capital at the ratio of one (1) EUROAPI share per twenty-three (23) Sanofi shares. Fractional share rights will not be tradable or tr ansferable. Consequently, when the amount of the distribution of the dividend in kind to which a Sa nofi shareholder is entitled does not correspond to a whole number of EUROAPI shares (i.e., a holding of Sa nofi shares of less than twenty-three (23) or a multiple of twenty-three (23)), the shareholder w ill receive the immediately lower number of EUROAPI shares, plus a cash payment for the whole of the balance arising from the price at which EUROAPI shares corresponding to fractional shares were sold. After May 5, 2022, investors will no longer be able to acquire Sanofi shares that are eligible for the Di stribution in Kind. As a result, shareholders holding fewer than twenty-three (23) Sanofi shares as of May 9, 2022 (i.e., after taking into account the orders executed during the day of May 5, 2022 for which se ttlement will take plac e on May 9, 2022), will receive a cash payment only. 22.1.3 Persons eligible for the Distribution in Kind All outstanding Sanofi shares as of the Ex-Dividend Date will be eligible for the distribution described in the Prospectus, with the exception of (i) the treasury shares held by Sanofi itself and (ii) shares issued upon exercise since January 1, 2022 of the options to subscribe for Sanofi shares granted under the Sanofi stock option plans, under the terms of wh ich the shares received upon exercise would not be entitled to the dividend for the year N-1. Persons eligible for the Distribution in Kind will be the Sanofi shareholders (other than Sanofi itself and holders of shares issued upon the exercise of Sanofi stock options since January 1, 2022) whose shares were registered in their name at the end of the accounting day preceding the Ex-Dividend Date of the Distribution in Kind, i.e., in the evening of May 5, 2022 (after taking into account any orders executed during the day of May 5, 2022, even if the settlement and delivery of these orders were to take place after the Ex-Dividend Date of the Distribution in Kind). Consequently, any person (other than Sanofi itself and holders of shares issued upon the exercise of Sanofi stock options since January 1, 2022) who has acquired Sanofi shares (without having resold them) prior to the Ex-Dividend Date of the Distribu tion in Kind will be eligible for the Distribution in Kind pursuant to the applicable market rules, as described in the Prospectus. In the event of dismemberment of ownership of the shares, the beneficiary of the Distribution in Kind will be the bare owner, unless otherw ise agreed. Sanofi shareholders ar e invited to contact their usual advisor on these matters. 22.1.4 Allocation ratio of the Company's shares The Company's shares will be distributed by Sanofi to the eligible persons mentioned above at the ratio of one (1) Company share per twenty-three (23) Sanofi shares. 29222.1.5 Practical terms of the Distribution in Kind The amount of the Distribution in Kind will be determined by multiplying the number of EUROAPI shares distributed by the opening trading price of the EUROAPI share on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on the Ex-Dividend Date. It will not result from a process of construction of an order book which would materialize the confrontation of th e offer of the Company's shares and the demands. No fractional EUROAPI shares will be issued. Fractional share rights will not be tradable or transferable. Consequently, when the amount of the distribution of the dividend in kind to which a Sanofi shareholder is entitled does not correspond to a whole number of EUROAPI shares (i.e., a holding of Sanofi shares of less than twenty-three (23) or a multiple of twenty-three (23)), the shareholder will receive the immediately lower number of EUROAPI shares plus a cash payment for the whole of the balance, arising from the price at which the EUROAPI shares corresponding to fractional shares will have been sold. After May 5, 2022, investors will no longer be ab le to acquire Sanofi shares that are eligible for the Distribution in Kind. As a result, any shareholde r holding fewer than twenty-three (23) Sanofi shares as of May 9, 2022 (i.e., after taking into account the orders executed during the day of May 5, 2022 for which settlement will take place on May 9, 2022), will only receive a cash balance. For each Sanofi share, the detachment of the ordina ry dividend in cash and the dividend in kind will take place simultaneously, on the Ex-Dividend Date, be fore the opening of market trading. Payment of the ordinary dividend in cash, delivery of the EUR OAPI shares allocated in r espect of the Distribution in Kind will take place on May 10, 2022. The bank performing the centralization operations for the Distribution in Kind (the \"Centralizing Agent\") is BNP Paribas Securities Services, 9 rue du D\u00e9barcad\u00e8re - 93761 Pantin Cedex. For Sanofi shares held in bearer or administered regi stered form, the following operations will be carried out: the Centralizing Agent will credit, via Euroclear France, each financial intermediary (i) on the date of payment of the Distribution in Kind, with the whole number of EUROAPI shares corresponding to its position in Sanofi shares duly registered with Euroclear France at the end of the accounting day on the date of the determina tion of the beneficiaries of the Distribution in Kind, i.e., May 9, 2022, by applying the parity of one (1) EUROAPI share for twenty-three (23) Sanofi shares registered in the account of the fina ncial intermediary concerned, then (ii) as from the sale by the Centralizing Agent of the shares corresponding to the fractional shares remaining after the distribution of EUROAPI shares be tween the financial intermediaries holding securities accounts, of the cash amount of the balancing payment due to this financial intermediary within 30 days of the date of payment of the Distribution in Kind; and after which each of the financial intermediary holding the account will credit each of its clients first (i) with the whole number of EUROAPI sh ares corresponding to th e multiples of twenty- three (23)) Sanofi shares registered in its books in the name of the client concerned and then (ii) with the amount in cash of the balance due to th is client, the amount of which shall be derived from the sale by such account-keepin g financial intermediary on the market and shall be based on the transfer price of the shares corresponding to the fractional shares belonging to this customer, within 30 days of the date of payment of the Distribution in Kind. For Sanofi shares held in a direct registered acc ount, the following operations will be carried out: the Centralizing Agent, acting as the financial interm ediary in charge of maintaining the register of fully registered shareholders, will (i) credit, as from the date of payment of the Distribution in Kind, the account of each person entitled to the Distribution in Kind holding fully registered Sanofi shares with the number of EUROAPI shar es corresponding to the multiples of twenty- three (23) Sanofi shares held in fully register ed form by the person entitled to the Distribution 293in Kind concerned, and (ii) credit, as from the sale of the shares corresponding to the fractional shares by the Centralizing Agent on the market, th e account of each of the persons entitled to the Distribution in Kind concerned by the net amount of the balancing payment due to him/her, if any, the amount of which will depend on the tr ansfer price of the shares corresponding to the fractional shares on the stock market within 30 days of the date of payment of the Distribution in Kind. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 25 of Sanofi's articles of association, subject to their amendment by Sanofi's combined annual shareholders' meeting to be held on May 3, 2 022, to introduce the ability for the shareholders' meeting to decide, for all or pa rt of a dividend distribution (or distribution of other interim dividends, reserves or premiums, etc.), that th is distribution be made in kind through the delivery of company assets, including financial securities, Sa nofi shareholders holding fewer than twenty-three (23) Sanofi shares as of May 9, 2022 (i.e., after taki ng into account the orders executed during the day of May 5, 2022 for which settlement will take pl ace on May 9, 2022),, will not receive any EUROAPI shares in the context of the Distributi on in Kind, but only a cash balance. Persons entitled to the Distribution in Kind, regardl ess of the manner in which they hold their Sanofi shares, must pay to their authorized financial interm ediary or to Sanofi, through BNP Paribas Securities Services, the social security contributions and/or the withholding tax due in respect of the Distribution in Kind. Where applicable, the authorized financial intermediary responsible fo r maintaining the bearer or administered registered securities accounts, or Sanofi, through BNP Paribas Securities Services, responsible for maintaining the pure registered securities accounts, may sell the number of EUROAPI securities necessary to pay the social security contribut ions and/or the non-discharge levy or withholding tax due in respect of the Distribution in Kind. With respect to Sanofi shares held in pure registered form, Sanofi, through BNP Paribas Securities Services, which is responsible for maintaining the pure registered share accounts, will sell the number of EU ROAPI shares necessary to pay the social security contributions and/or the withholding tax due in respect of the Distribution in Kind. Sanofi's shareholders wishing to sell the EUROAPI shares received as part of the Distribution in Kind should contact their usual financia l advisor and/or their financial intermediary holding the account. The attention of the shareholders of Sanofi is drawn to the fact that the amount of the cash balance that each shareholder will receive according to his situati on will not be calculated on the basis of the opening price of the EUROAPI share on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on the Ex-Dividend Date, but on the basis of the prices at which each financial intermediary will sell the shares corresponding to the fractional shares of its entitled clients. As a result, the amount of the balance may vary between financial intermediaries. 22.1.6 Tax rules applicable to the Distribution in Kind Under current French tax legislation and regulati ons, the following provisions summarize some of the French tax consequences that may apply to Sanofi shar eholders in respect of the Distribution in Kind. Shareholders are nonetheless reminded that this in formation is a summary of the applicable tax framework and is provided for guidance purposes only. The rules set out below may be affected by any legislative and regulatory changes which may be retro active or apply to the current year or financial year. The following tax information is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all tax impacts that may apply to Sanofi shareholders in relation to the Distribution in Kind. Individuals who are Sanofi shareholders are invited to contact their usual tax advisor with regard to the taxation applicable to their specific situation. 294Individuals who are not tax residents in France must also comply with current tax legislation in their country of residence and notably, where applicable , with the provisions of the international tax agreement signed by France and their country of residence. The sums required for the payment of taxes and/or so cial contributions must be made available to the paying establishment before the de livery of securities. Where requir ed, the paying establishment may sell the necessary number of EUROAPI shares to pay th e applicable taxes and/or social contributions. Shareholders are invited to contact their account- holding institution for information regarding the procedure that it has put in place. (a) Shareholders whose tax residence is in France (i) Individuals acting in the context of th e management of their private assets (i) who do not own shares in the Company w ithin the framework of a classic share savings plan (PEA - Plan d'Epargne en Actions ) or (ii) within the framework of an employee savings plan, (iii) who have not recorded their shares as assets on their business balance sheet and (iv) who do not trade on the stock market under conditions similar to those charac terizing an activity carried out by a person engaged in such transactions on a professional basis. Dividends paid to these shareholders, both in cash or in the form of a dividend in kind, follow the regime described in Paragraph 22.3.11(b)(i) of the Prospectus. (ii) Corporate shareholders subject to corporate income tax (under the conditions of ordinary law) Dividends paid to these shareholders, both in cash or in the form of a dividend in kind, follow the regime described in Paragraph 22.3.11( b)(ii) of the Prospectus. (iii) Other shareholders Sanofi shareholders subject to a tax regime other than those referred to above, in particular taxpayers whose transactions in securities go beyond simple por tfolio management or who have recorded their shares as assets on their commerci al balance sheet, should obtain information on the tax regime applicable to their particular case from their usual tax advisor. (b) Shareholders whose tax residence is outside France Dividends paid to these shareholders, both in cash or in the form of a dividend in kind, follow the regime described in Paragraph 22.3.11(a) of the Prospectus. 22.2 Risks related to the Company's shares In addition to the risk fact ors described in Chapter 3 \" Risk factors relating to the issuer \" of the Prospectus, investors are advised to take into account the following risks and other information contained in the Prospectus before deciding to in vest in the Company's shares. Investing in the Company's shares involves risks. The material risks id entified by the Company as of the date of approval of the Prospectus by the AMF are those described in Chapter 3 \" Risk factors relating to the issuer \" of the Prospectus and those described below. The risk factors that the Company considers, as of the date of the Prospectus, to be the most important (marked with an asterisk) are, in the Prospectus, mentioned first within each risk category. If one of these risks were to materiali ze, the Group's activities, financial situation, results or outlook could be materially affected. In such an eventuality, the price of the Company's shares could fall, and investors could lose a ll or part of the sums they have invested in the Company's shares. Other risks and uncertainties unknown to the Company as of the date of the Prospectus, or that it deems, as of that same date, to be immaterial, could exist and arise and also disrupt 295or have an unfavorable effect on the Group's activiti es, financial situation, results and outlook of the price of the Company's shares. 22.2.1 The price of the Company's shares could be affected by a high degree of volatility* The technical reference price of the Company's shar es does not predict the performance of the market price of the Company's shares followi ng their admission to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. The price determined following the admission of the Company's shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris may differ significantly fr om the technical reference price of the Company's shares. In general, the market price of the Company's shar es could be significantly affected by numerous factors impacting the Company; its competitors; the gene ral economic, commercial and political conditions; and the API market. Among other things, the market price of the Company's shares could fluctuate significantly in response to events such as: - changes in the business activity, financial results , forecasts or outlook of the Group or of its competitors from one period to the next; - announcements by competitors or other comp anies engaged in similar activities and/or announcements concerning the API market, includ ing in relation to the financial and operating performance or outlook of these companies; - unfavorable changes in the regulatory environment applicable in the countries or markets of the Group's business sector, to its customers or to the Group itself; - announcements concerning changes in the Company's share ownership; - announcements concerning changes to the ma nagement team or key employees; and - announcements concerning the scope of the Compa ny's assets (acquisitions, disposals, etc.). Moreover, stock markets undergo major fluctuations that are not always directly related to the results and outlook of the companies whose sh ares are traded. In particular, the evolution of the current sanitary crisis relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and certain changes in international relations, including the introduction of new restrictions and/or internationa l trade sanctions, tension and armed conflict notably in Eastern Europe such as the current conflict between Ukraine and Russia and in other emerging markets, could notably have a significant impact on st ock markets. Such market fluctuations, as well as the economic climate, could therefore materially a ffect the market price of the Company's shares. 22.2.2 A liquid market for the Company's shares may not develop or last over time* Until their admission to trading on Euronext Paris, the Company's shares have never been traded on a financial market. Although the Company has request ed the admission of its shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, no assurance can be given of the existence of a liquid market for the shares, nor that such a market, if it develops, will last over time. Should no liquid market for the Company's shares emer ge, the shares' market price and the investors' ability to trade the shares under cond itions that they may deem satisfactory may be significantly affected. 29622.2.3 The sale of a significant number of the shares fo llowing the distribution of the Company's shares in connection with the Distribution in Kind, after the end of the lock-up period, or the possibility of such a sale taking place, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company's shares* Sanofi will hold, through Sanofi, approximately 30% of the Company's share capital af ter the completion of the Distribution in Kind and the Investment. In the event that Sanof i decides to sell all or part of its equity interest at the end of its lock-up (see Section 17.1 \" Shareholders holding more than 5% of the capital on the date of the Prospectus \" of the Prospectus) or prior to its expiration in the event of the early release of the lock-up, or if such a sale is considered imminent or probable, there may be a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company's shares. L'Or\u00e9al, which has undertaken to retain the EUROAPI shares received in connection with the Distribution in Kind for a period of 365 calendar days following the date of delivery of the shares of the Distribution in Kind (see Section 22.5.3 \" Distribution of capital and voting rights \" of the Prospectus), may also decide to sell all or part of its shareholding on the market upon expiry of the retention undertaking or in the event of the lifting of the lock-up undertaking. In addition, other Sanofi shareholders benefiting from the Distribution in Kind will not be subject to any lock-up undertaking. They could therefore sell th e EUROAPI shares received in connection with the Distribution in Kind, which could induce a downward pressure on the share price of EUROAPI shares. In particular, EUROAPI, unlike Sanofi, will not be included in the Euronext Paris CAC40 index, which could lead to significant sales by index funds. 22.2.4 Sanofi shareholders may be subject to the 12.8% withholding tax and/or to social security contributions at the overall rate of 17.2% of the gross amount of the allocation received in connection with the Distribution in Kind The Distribution in Kind will be treated as a taxa ble dividend for Sanofi shareholders whose tax residence is in France. As a result, French individua ls will be subject to a non-dischargeable withholding tax at the rate of 12.8% in respect of income tax and/ or to social security withholdings at the overall rate of 17.2%, corresponding to a total of 30% of the gross amount of dist ributed income. The sums necessary for the payment of the tax and/or social security de ductions shall be made available to the paying agent prior to the delivery of the EUROAPI shares or to th e payment of the proceeds re sulting from the transfer of the EUROAPI shares corresponding to fractional shar es within the context of the Distribution in Kind. Where applicable, the paying ins titution may sell the number of EUROAPI shares necessary to pay the applicable tax and/or social security deductions (see Section 22.1.6 \" Tax rules applicable to the Distribution in Kind \" of the Prospectus). As French tax law currently stands, and subject to th e possible application of international tax treaties, Sanofi shareholders whose tax residence is outside France will in principle be subject to a withholding tax levied by the paying agent (see Section 22.3.11 \" Withholding tax on dividends \" of the Prospectus). They should check with their usual tax advisor as to the tax treatment of their situation. 22.3 Information on the securities to be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris 22.3.1 Type, class and dividend entitlement date of the shares to be admitted to trading The securities of the Company for which admission to tr ading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris is sought include all of the 94,026,888 ordinary sh ares making up the share capital of the Company, all of which have the same nominal value, are fully subscribed, fully paid up and of the same class (the \"Existing Shares\"). Taking into account the capital transactions described in Section 20.1.7 \" History of the share capital over the past three years \" of the Prospectus and upon their completion, the Company's shares will have a nominal value of \u20ac1 each and will be fully paid. 297Dividend entitlement date The Existing Shares will carry current dividend rights. Denomination for the shares EUROAPI ISIN Code FR0014008VX5 Mnemonic EAPI Compartment Compartment A Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) 20103015 - Pharmaceuticals Initial listing and trading of the shares As from May 6, 2022, all of the Company's shares will be traded on a quotation line entitled \"EUROAPI\". 22.3.2 Applicable law and competent courts The Company's shares are subject to French law. In the event of a dispute with the Company, the competent courts sha ll be those located in the locality of the Company's registered office in cases where th e Company is a defendant, and shall be designated according to the nature of the dispute in cases wher e the Company is a plaintiff, unless otherwise provided by the French Code of Civil Procedure ( Code de proc\u00e9dure civile ). 22.3.3 Form and registration of shares The Company's ordinary shares may be held in regi stered or bearer form, at the discretion of the shareholders. In accordance with Article L. 211-3 of th e French Monetary an d Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), the shares must be registered in a securiti es account held, as the case may be, by the Company or an authorized intermediary. As a result, the rights of the holders shall be ev idenced by an entry in a securities account opened in their name in the books of: BNP Paribas Securities Services (9 rue du D\u00e9ba rcad\u00e8re - 93761 Pantin Cedex), appointed by the Company, for shares held in pure registered form; an authorized intermediary of their choice and BNP Paribas Securities Services (9 rue du D\u00e9barcad\u00e8re - 93761 Pantin Cedex), appointed by the Company, for shares held in administered registered form; or 298 an authorized intermediary of their c hoice for shares held in bearer form. In accordance with Articles L. 211-15 and L. 211-17 of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), ordinary shares may be transferred from one account to another, and the transfer of ownership of the shares shall be evidenced by their registration in the purchaser's securities account. An application will be made for the Company's or dinary shares to be accepted for clearance through Euroclear France, which will be responsible for clear ing the shares between custodians. An application will also be made for acceptan ce for clearance through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, a public limited company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme in Luxembourg). In connection with the Distribution in Kind, the Co mpany shares automatically registered in the account of the beneficiaries will be registered in pure regist ered form, in administered registered form or in bearer form, depending on whether the shareholders hold their Sanofi shares in pure registered form, administered registered form or in bearer form, respectively. The Company's securities services (maintenance of th e register of shareholders holding pure and administered registered shares) and financial servi ces (payment of dividends) will be provided by BNP Paribas Securities Services (9 rue du D\u00e9barcad\u00e8re - 93761 Pantin Cedex). According to the indicative timetable, it is expected that the Existing Shares will be tradable as from May 6, 2022. 22.3.4 Currency The Company's shares will be allocated free of ch arge, and the Company has been informed by Sanofi that this allocation will take place within the frame work of the distribution of a dividend in kind by Sanofi. The shares will be listed in euros. 22.3.5 Rights attached to the shares The Company's ordinary shares will be subject to the provisions of the Company's articles of association as adopted by the sole shareholder on March 30, 2022, with effect as of the admission to trading of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. Pursuant to French law and to the Company's artic les of association, governing the Company as of its initial listing, the main rights attached to the ordinary shares include the following: (a) Dividend rights - Right to share in the Company's profits The Company's ordinary shares are entitled to a portion of the Comp any's profits under the conditions set out in Articles L. 232-10 et seq . of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ). At least 5% of the profit for the year, less any previo us losses, is first deducted to form the reserve fund required by law. This deduction ceases to be mandatory when the reserve fund reaches one tenth of the share capital. The balance, increased by any profits carried forward, represents the profit ava ilable for distribution to the shareholders in the form of a dividend, in accordance with the legal and regulatory conditions. The shareholders' meeting may give shareholders the choice, for all or part of the dividends to be distributed, between payment in cash or in shares of the Company in accordance with the conditions laid down by law. The same opportunity to choose be tween payment in cash and payment in shares may be given in the case of interim dividends. 299The shareholders' meeting may deduct from this profit, before any dividend is paid, such sums as it deems appropriate, either to be carried forward to th e following financial year, or to be transferred to one or more general or special reserve funds, the appropriation or use of which it shall be free to determine. The shareholders' meeting may also decide to dist ribute the sums deducted from the reserves available to it, in accordance with the law. In such a case, the meeting's decision shall expressly specify the reserve accounts from which sums are to be deducted. However, except in the event of a capital reduction, no distribution may be made to shareholders in cases where the shareholder equity is, or would become as a result of such a distribution, less than the amount of the capital plus the reserves which, accordi ng to the law or the articles of association, may not be distributed. Any action against the Company for payment of divi dends due on the shares will be time-barred after five years from the date on which they became due. In addition, dividends not claimed within five years of their due date will be forfeited to the French State. Dividends paid to non-residents are, as a rule, subject to withholding tax (see Section 22.3.11 \"Withholding tax on dividends \" of the Prospectus). (b) Voting rights Voting rights attached to ordinary shares are proportio nal to the portion of share capital they represent. Each ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote, it being specified that the double voting right provided for in Article L.225-123 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) is expressly excluded. The voting rights attached to shares subject to usufruct belong to the usufructuary ( usufruitier ) at ordinary bare owner ( nu-propri\u00e9taire ) at extraordinary shareholders' meetings. (c) Preferential subscription rights for securities of the same class The Company's shares carry a preferential subscr iption right to subscrib e to capital increases. Shareholders have, proportionally to the amount of their shares, a preferential subscription right to the cash shares issued to carry out an immediate or future capital increa se. A preferential subscription right is negotiable where it is detached from shares that ar e themselves negotiable. Where this is not the case, it may be transferred under the same conditions as the share itself. Shareholders may individually renounce their preferential subscription rights to shares (Articles L. 225-132 and L. 228-91 to L. 228-93 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce )). (d) Right to participate in any surp lus in the event of liquidation Each ordinary share gives a right to an identical shar e of ownership in corporate assets, in the distribution of profits and in the liquidation dividend, s ubject to the creation of preferred shares. (e) Redemption or conversion clauses The Company's articles of association do not contai n any provisions relating to the redemption or conversion of ordinary shares. (f) Crossing of shareholding thresholds As long as the shares of the Company are admitted to trading on a regulated market, in addition to the disclosure thresholds expressly provided by current laws and regulations in force, any individual or legal 300entity who may own, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert, a fraction of the capital or voting rights (calculated in accordance with Articles L. 233-7 a nd L. 233-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the AMF General Regulation) equal to or greater than 1% of the share capital or voting rights in the Company, or any multiple of this percentage, including above the thresholds set by legal and regulatory provisions, must notify the Co mpany of the total number (i) of shares and voting rights that such individual or entity owns, (ii) the securities giving fu ture access to the Company's equity that said individual or entity owns and the voting rights potentially attach ed thereto, and (iii) assimilated shares in application of Article L. 233-9 I, paragraphs 1\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 to 8\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce ). This notification must be given by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt (or by any other equivalent means) within fo ur trading days from the date the relevant threshold is crossed. This required disclosure to the Company also app lies, under the same deadlines and the same conditions, whenever the shareholder's equity investment or voting rights fall below the aforementioned thresholds. In the event of non-compliance with the aforemen tioned disclosure threshold requirement and on a request recorded in the minutes of the sharehol ders' meeting, from one or more shareholders representing at least 5% of the capital or voting ri ghts, the shares exceeding the fraction which should have been disclosed will lose their voting rights for a period of two years following the date when proper notification is given. The Company reserves the option to make the public and the shareholders aware either of the information in the disclosure received or the failure of the person in question to comply with the above obligation. (g) Identification of holders of securities The Company is authorized to avail itself to the legal provisions relating to the identification of holders of securities conferring immediate or future vo ting rights at its own sh areholders' meetings. 22.3.6 Authorizations The Distribution in Kind will take place following the adoption of the resolution relating to such Distribution in Kind at Sanofi's combined shareholde rs' meeting (ruling in an ordinary manner) to be held on May 3, 2022. It is specified that the payment of the Dividend in Ki nd in the form of a distribution of one (1) share of EUROAPI for twenty-three (23) Sanofi shares will be proposed subject to the approval by Sanofi shareholders (ruling in an extraordinary manne r) of a resolution amending Sanofi's articles of association notably to introduce the ab ility for the shareholders' meeting to decide, for all or part of a dividend distribution (or distribution of other interim dividends, reserves or premiums, etc.), that this distribution be made in kind through the delivery of company assets, including financial securities, with or without a cash option. 22.3.7 Expected date of registration of the Comp any's shares granted to Sanofi shareholders The registration of the Company's shares distributed to Sanofi shareholders will take place on or after May 10, 2022, as described in Section 22.1.5 \" Practical terms of the Distribution in Kind \" of the Prospectus. 22.3.8 Restrictions on the free tradability of the shares There is no clause in the articles of association lim iting the free tradability of the shares comprising the Company's share capital. 301Sanofi Aventis Participations' and the Investor lo ck-up undertakings are described in Section 17.1 \"Shareholders holding more than 5% of the capital on the date of the Prospectus \" of the Prospectus and the lock-up undertaking of L'Or\u00e9al and of Karl Ro tthier, who will be appointed Chief Executive Officer as of the Company's transformation into a French public limited company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme ), are described in Paragraph 22.5.3 \" Distribution of capital and voting rights \" of the Prospectus. 22.3.9 French regulations relating to public offers As from the admission of the Company' s shares to trading on the regulat ed market of Euronext Paris, the Company will be subject to the laws and regulati ons in force in France relating to tender offers, including mandatory tender offers, public squeeze-outs and buyout offers. (a) Mandatory tender offer Article L. 433-3 of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ) and Articles 234-1 et seq . of the AMF General Regulation establish th e conditions for the mandatory filing of a proposed tender offer, drafted in such a way that it can be declared compliant by the AMF, for all the equity securities and securities giving access to the sh are capital or voting rights of a company whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market. (b) Public buyout offer and squeeze-out Article L. 433-4 of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ) and Articles 236-1 et buyout offer) and 237-1 et seq . (squeeze-out following any tender offer) of the AMF General Regulation establish the conditions fo r the filing of a public buyout offer and the conditions for the implementation of a squeeze-out procedure for the minority shareholders of a company whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market. 22.3.10 Public takeover bids by third parties on the Company's share capital during the previous and current financial years As the Company's shares were not admitted for tradi ng on a regulated market on the date on which the Prospectus was approved by the AMF, no public ta keover bids were made by third parties on the Company's share capital during the previous financial year or the current financial year. 22.3.11 Withholding tax on dividends Information included in the Prospectus is a summar y of certain tax consequences, notably relating to withholding tax and deductions to income from Company shares, that may apply to individuals who become Company shareholders and subject to the possi ble application of international tax agreements. The rules set out below are those applicable on the date of the Prospectus and may therefore be affected by any legislative and regulatory changes (with retroac tive effect when applicable), or by a change to their interpretation by the French tax authorities. Th is information is not intended as a comprehensive analysis of all tax impacts that may apply to Comp any shareholders. The latter are invited to contact their usual tax advisor with regard to the ta xation applicable to their specific situation. The following sections are not intended to describ e consequences relating to share subscriptions, acquisitions, ownership and disposal s. Shareholders are invited to obtain information regarding their individual situation from their usual tax advisor, in pa rticular in terms of the subscription, acquisition, ownership and disposal of shares in the Company. Individuals who are not tax residents in France must also comply with current tax legislation in their country of residence and, where applicable, with th e provisions of the international tax agreement signed by France and their country of residence. 302Where necessary, it is specified that withholding ta x and deductions described in the following sections shall in no case be borne by the Company. (a) Withholding tax on dividends paid to share holders whose tax residence is outside France Under current French tax legislation and subject to the possible application of international tax agreements, the following provisi ons resume some of the French tax consequences in terms of deductions to income from shares that may apply to shareholders (i) who are not residents in France within the meaning of Article 4B of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) or whose registered office is located outside France and (ii) whose ownership of shares is not attributable to a fixed base or a permanent establishment subject to taxa tion in France. Shareholders are invited to contact their usual tax advisor with regard to the ta xation applicable to their specific situation. Dividends paid by the Company are, in principle, subject to withholding tax, which is deducted by the establishment which pays the dividends when the tax r esidence or registered office of the beneficiary is located outside of France. Subject to the provisions below, the rate of this withholding tax is set at (i) 12.8% when the beneficiary is an individual, (ii) 15% when the beneficiary is an entity with its registered office in a member State of the European Union or in another State party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area with which France has signed a double taxation agreement to combat fraud and tax evasion and which, if it were based in France, would be taxed according to the special regime provided for in Article 206 of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ), which covers bodies commonly referred to as \"not-for-profit-organizations\", as stated in Section 580 et seq . of the French administrative guidelines BOI-IS-CHAMP-10-50-10-40-20130 325, and interpreted by the appli cable jurisdiction, and (iii) 25% in other cases. However, regardless of the location of the tax reside nce, place of residence or registered office of the beneficiary, subject to the provisions of internationa l tax agreements, if divide nds paid by the Company are paid outside of France and in a Non-Cooperative State or Territory (NCST) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ), with the exception of those mentioned in section 2 bis, paragr aph 2\u00b0 of Article 238-08 A of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ), said dividends are subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 75%, unless the Company can provide proof that the purpose or consequence of di stributing these dividends in this State or territory is not tax evasion, in accordance with Articles 119 bi s and 187 of the French General Tax Code. The list of NCSTs is published by ministerial order and may be updated at any time and in principle at least once a year. French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) provisions referring to Article 238-0 A of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) apply to the States and territories added to this list as of the first day of the third month following the publication of the order. The withholding tax may be reduced, or ev en canceled, notably in accordance with: Article 119 ter of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) applicable under certain conditions to legal entity shareholders who are beneficial owners of dividends: o that have their actual management offices in a European Union State or in another State party to the Agreement on the European Ec onomic Area, with which France has signed a double taxation agreement to combat fraud and tax evasion and who are not considered, under the terms of a tax agreemen t with a third State, as being resident for tax purposes outside the European Union or the European Economic Area; 303o which take one of the forms listed in A ppendix 1, Section A of Council Directive 2011/96/EU dated November 30, 2011, relating to the ordinary tax regime applicable to the parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States or an equivalent form when the company has its actual mana gement offices in a State party to the European Economic Area; o which have directly held, continuously fo r two years or more and through direct ownership or bare ownership, at least 10% of the share capital of the legal entity which distributes the dividends, or which undertake to hold this stake continuously for a period of at least two years and which appoint, as for the purpose of tax on revenue, a representative responsible for the payment of the withholding tax in the event of non- compliance with this commitment and meet a ll the other conditions referred to in this Article and as stated in the French ad ministrative guidelines BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-30- 20-10-20190703, it being specified however that (i) this holding rate is reduced to 5% of the share capital of the distributing French company when the legal entity that is the beneficial owner of the dividends holds an equity interest which meets the conditions set out in Article 145 of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) and is unable to offset the withholding tax in its State of residence (BOI-RPPM-RCM-30- 30-20-40-20160607) and (ii) holding rates ar e assessed by taking into account direct ownership and bare ownership; and o that are liable, in a Member State of the European Union or in a State party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area wh ere it has its actual management offices, for corporate income tax in this State, without the possibility of an option or of being exempt; it being noted that Article 119 ter of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) does not apply to dividends paid as part of an arrangement or series of arrangements that, having been set up to obtain, as a primary objective or as one of the primary objectives, a tax benefit that is contrary to the purpose of Article 119 ter of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ), is not genuine in light of all the relevant facts and circumstances; or Article 119 quinquies of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ), applicable to legal entity shareholders based in a member State of the European Union or in another State or territory with which France has signed a doubl e taxation agreement to combat fraud and tax evasion that are subject to liquidation proceedings as referred to in Article L. 640-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) (or in the absence of such a procedure, or are in a state of insolvency and in a position where rec overy is clearly impossible) and that meet the other conditions set out in Article 119 qui nquies of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) as stated in the French administrative guidelines BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-30-20-70- 20211021; or applicable international ta x agreements, if relevant. Moreover, income distributed to collective investme nt vehicles formed under foreign law that (i) are located in a Member State of the Eu ropean Union or in a nother State or territory with which France has signed a double taxation agreement to combat fraud and tax evasion meeting the conditions set out in Article 119 bis, 2 of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ), (ii) raise capital from a certain number of investors with a view to invest, in accordance with a defined investment policy, in the interest of these investors, and (iii) have similar characteristics to the collec tive investment vehicles formed under French law that meet the conditions set out in Article 119 bis, 2 of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) and in the French administrative guidelines BOI-RPPM-RCM-30- 30-20-70-20200812, is exempt from withholding tax. 304Shareholders are invited to contact their usual tax advisor to establish whether, and under what conditions, they may benefit from one of these exem ptions or a reduced rate of withholding tax. Company shareholders are responsible for contacting their usual tax advisor to establish whether they are likely to be subject to NCST legislation and/ or benefit from a reduction in or exemption from withholding tax and to determine the practical cond itions for applying these agreements as provided, notably, by the French administrative guidelines BOI-INT-DG-20-20-20-20-2012 0912 relating to the \"normal\" or \"simplified\" procedure for the re duction of or exemption from withholding tax. Non-French tax residents must also comply with current tax legislation in their country of residence, as may be modified by the international tax agreement signed by France and their country of residence. Article 119 bis A of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) provides for the application by the paying agent of withholding tax of up to 25% for temporary asset sales or similar transactions relating to dividend payments that allow non-resident shareholders of French companies to avoid the withholding tax that is normally applicable. In such cases, withholding tax applies without the beneficiary being given access to the \"simplified\" proce dure in order to benefit from the more favorable provisions of any applicable tax agreement. Howeve r, the text provides, under certain conditions, for a safeguard measure allowing for the reimbursement of a ll or part of the withholding tax deducted if the shareholder can provide proof that this payment co rresponds to a transaction for which the main purpose is not to avoid the application of a withholding tax or to obtain a tax advantage. (b) Withholding tax on dividends paid to share holders whose tax residence is in France Company shares may be held within th e framework of a share savings plan. (i) Individuals acting in the context of th e management of their private assets (i) who do not own shares in the Company with in the framework of a share savings plan or (ii) within the framework of an employee savings plan, (iii) who have not recorded their shares as assets on th eir business balance sheet and (iv) who do not trade on the stock market under conditions similar to those characterizing an activity carried out by a person engaged in such transactions on a professional basis. Non-definitive deduction of 12.8% In accordance with Article 117 quater of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ), subject to the exceptions referred to below, individu al shareholders domiciled in France are subject to a non-definitive withholding tax at a rate of 12.8% on the gross amount of distributed income. This amount is withheld by the establishment which pays the divi dends if it is located in France. When the paying establishment is located outside of France, income is declared and the corresponding deduction is paid, within the first 15 days of the month following the payment of the income from shares, either by the taxpayers themselves, or by the part y which pays the income, when th e latter is located in a Member State of the European Union, or in another Stat e party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area with which France has signed a double taxation agreement to combat fraud and tax evasion, and said party has been authorized to do so by the taxpayer. However, when the establishment paying dividends is located in France, individuals belonging to a tax household whose reference taxable income for the penultimate year, as provided for in Section IV, paragraph 1\u00b0 of Article 1417 of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ), is less than \u20ac50,000 for single, divorced or widowed taxpayers and \u20ac75,000 for taxpayers subject to joint taxation, can apply for an exemption from this withholding ta x under the conditions set out in Article 242 quater of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ), i.e., by producing, by November 30 of the year preceding that of the payment of the distribut ed income, for those making the payment, a sworn statement declaring that the reference taxable inco me shown on the tax notice established for income 305received two years prior to the payment of said inco me from dividends is lower than the above-stated thresholds. However, taxpayers w ho acquire shares after the deadline for submitting an application for the above-mentioned exemption may, under certain conditions, submit this request for exemption to their paying establishment when said shares are acquire d, in accordance with Section 320 of the French administrative guidelines BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-20-10-20210706. When the paying establishment is located outside of France, only individuals belonging to a tax household whose reference taxable income for the penultimate year, as provided for in Section IV, paragraph 1\u00b0 of Article 1417 of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ), is equal to or higher than the amounts stated above are subject to th e non-definitive withholding tax at a rate of 12.8%. The withholding is not in full discharge of income tax and, where applicable, of the exceptional contribution on high incomes. However, it can be de ducted from the income tax due for the year in which it is applied, and any excess is refundable. Un less the taxpayer opts out of the application of the 12.8% flat-rate income tax applicable to income from movable assets (except fo r certain exempt income) and capital gains, in order for these incomes to be ta ken into account for the determination of the overall net income subject to the progressive income tax sc ale, the non-definitive 12.8% withholding tax rate will correspond to the flat-rate taxation for personal income tax. The option for the progressive income tax scale applies on an annual basi s to all income from transferable securities and capital gains subject to the aforementioned flat-rate taxation of 12.8% and earned during the same year. In the event of payment of dividends outside Fran ce in an NCST, with the exception of those included in this list other than those mentioned in paragraph 2\u00b0 of section 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ), regardless of the place of residence or the status of the shareholder concerned, a withholding tax at a rate of 75% is applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 75% withholding tax does not apply if the debtor proves that the distributions in such country or territory have neither the purpose nor the effect of permitting them to be located in an NCST for tax evasion purposes. The list of NCSTs is published by ministerial order and ma y be updated at any time and in principle at least once a year. French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) provisions referring to Article 238-0 A of th e French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) apply to the States and territories added to this list as of the fi rst day of the third month following the publication of the order. Social security contributions In addition, whether or not the non-definitive 12.8% withholding tax described above is applicable and whether or not the taxpayer has opted out of the 12.8% flat-rate tax, the gross amount of any dividends distributed by the Company will also be subject to th e full amount of social security contributions at the aggregate rate of 17.2%, allocated as follows: - the universal social security contribution (per the French acronym \"CSG\") at a rate of 9.2%; - the contribution to the Social Security deficit (CRDS), at a rate of 0.5%; and - the social welfare tax at a rate of 7.5%. If the dividends are subject to income tax at the fl at rate of 12.8%, these social security contributions are not deductible from taxable income. If taxpaye rs opt to have these dividends subject to the progressive income tax scale, the CSG will be partia lly deductible, up to 6.8%, from the total taxable income in the year of payment, and the balance of th e social security charges will not be deductible from taxable income. These social security deductions are levied in th e same way as the 12.8% non-definitive withholding tax described above when applicable. Shareholders are encouraged to contact their usual tax advisor to 306determine the terms and conditions for payment of social charges when the non-definitive 12.8% withholding tax does not apply. General provisions The concerned shareholders are encouraged to consul t their usual tax advisor to determine the terms and conditions for the declaration and payment of the non-definitive 12.8% withholding tax and social security contributions applicable to dividends, as well as, more generally, the tax regime applicable to their particular situation (including, in particular, the regime applicable to dividends for income tax purposes), whether or not the taxpayer may opt for th e progressive income tax scale and the tax regime applicable in the event that the ta xpayer decides to avoid the applica tion of the 12.8% flat-rate income tax. (ii) Corporate shareholders subject to corporate income tax (under the conditions of ordinary law) Income distributed with respect to the Company's shares held by legal entities whose residence is in France will not, in principle, be subject to any withholding tax. However, if the dividends paid by the Company are paid outside France in an NCST, with the exception of those included in this list other than those men tioned in paragraph 2\u00b0 of section 2 bis of Article 238- 0 A of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ), the dividends distributed by the Company are subject to a withholding tax at a ra te of 75%. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 75% withholding tax does not apply if the debtor proves that the distributions in such country or territory have neither the purpose nor the effect of permitting them to be located in an NCST for tax evasion purposes. The list of NCSTs is published by minister ial order and may be upda ted at any time and in principle at least once a year. French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) provisions referring to Article 238-0 A of the French General Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) apply to the States and territories added to this list as of the first day of th e third month following the publication of the order. Corporate shareholders are encouraged to consult th eir usual tax advisor to determine the tax treatment that will apply to them. (c) Other shareholders Shareholders of the Company subject to a tax regime other than those referred to above, in particular taxpayers holding their shares within the framework of a share savings plan (PEA) or an employee savings scheme or whose transactions in securities go beyond simple portfolio management or who have recorded their shares as assets on their commercial balance sheet, should obtain information on the tax regime applicable to their particul ar case from their usual tax advisor. (d) Financial transaction tax and registration fees The Company's shares may fall within the scope of the French financial transaction tax provided for in Article 235 ter ZD of the CGI (the \"French FTT\"), which applies, under certain conditions, to the acquisition of equity securities or similar securities ad mitted to trading on a French, European or foreign regulated market, when such secur ities are issued by a company whose registered office is located in France and whose market capitalization exceeds \u20ac1 billion euros as of December 1st of the year preceding the year of taxation. A list of compani es falling within the scope of the French FTT is published each year by the French tax authorities. In its last updated version, dated December 29, 2021, the Company was not on this list (BOI-ANNX-0004 67-29/12/2021). However, the Company could in the future be included in this list if its market capitalization on December 1st of the year preceding the year of taxation exceeds \u20ac1 billion.
