Key takeaways: A compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine may improve outcomes in certain patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Qiliqiangxin reduced risk for HF hospitalization and CV death. Qiliqiangxin, an herbal compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine, reduced risk for HF hospitalization and CV death among certain patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, a speaker reported. The results of the prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled QUEST trial were presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress. Qiliqiangxin (Yiling Pharmaceutical), a qi-tonifying and yang-warming herbal compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine, is formulated to improve blood circulation and aid diuresis. In Chinese medicine, qi \u2014 the composite of yin and yang \u2014 is the body's \"vital force,\" and balance of its two primary components is essential to maintaining good health, according to an article on Chinese medicine by Johns Hopkins Medicine. Other traditional remedies intended to balance qi include acupuncture, cupping \u2014 use of warm glass jars to create suction on the body \u2014 massage, tai chi and herbal remedies, such as qiliqiangxin. For the present study, Xinli Li, MD, PhD, of the department of cardiology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University in China, and colleagues evaluated the effect of qiliqiangxin capsules on CV outcomes in 3,080 patients with HFrEF. The double-blind treatment period continued for 3 years, and the primary outcome was incidence of a composite endpoint of CV death and HF hospitalization. During a median follow-up of 18.3 months, the risk for the composite primary outcome (HR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68-0.9; P < .001) and its components individually (HR for HF hospitalization = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.9; P = for = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68-0.996; P = .045) was lower among patients assigned to qiliqiangxin compared with those assigned placebo. The reported benefits of qiliqiangxin were consistent across most subgroups, including those with an ischemic etiology (P < .001); those not taking renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (P = .003); and patients who either were (P = .041) or were not (P = .012) taking an angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor at baseline. The benefits of qiliqiangxin in patients with HFrEF were not significant among those already taking renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (P = .079) or in those with HFrEF and no ischemic etiology (P = .575). \"Among the patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, the risk for hospitalization for heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes was lower among those who received the [qiliqiangxin] capsule than among those who received the placebo,\" Li said during a press conference. It was a very interesting study. The compound has 11 different herbal components, some of which are cardiac glycoside-like products as well as ginseng and other herbal products. Some proposed to act like angiotensin II receptor blockers and some proposed to upregulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. This compound appears to be effective in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The QUEST trial was a large study with over 3,000 patients who had symptomatic HFrEF with EF less than 40% and NYHA class II to III. Overall, 82% of patients were on either ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors, 87% 82% were on mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, 61% were on triple therapy and about 9% were on SGLT2 inhibitors. Over a course of 3 years, there was significant reduction in CV death and HF hospitalization rates. The risk reduction for the primary endpoint was about 22% and the components of the primary endpoint, HF hospitalization was reduced by about 24% and CV death was also significantly reduced by 17%. There were also very interesting trends in background subgroup analysis. Individuals who were on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition appear to have had less benefits than those who were not on the RAAS inhibition. So those individuals who were not being effectively treated appear to confer more benefit, raising the possibility of if the individuals are not on optimal doses of RAAS inhibition or background HF therapies, this compound may be more effective. Another interesting finding from an earlier study, which was carried out by the same investigators, was this compound improved EF but not the end-diastolic dimensions at 3 months and reduced N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, raising the question whether the cardiac glycoside or the digoxin-like components in it may be playing a role. Though the QUEST results are promising, we need further studies. The components, reproducibility and of course regulation of the content of this compound are important. The doses of each of the components, active components and their mechanisms of action will need to be further elucidated. Other areas that we'd like to be able to see some more information on is the effect in patients with mildly reduced and preserved EF; the potential interaction with other medications such as digoxin; and incremental value of this medication when the patients are on optimal doses of background GDMT including SGLT2 inhibitors. In this study, only about 9% of the patients were with background therapy of SGLT2 inhibition. In essence, the QUEST trial is raising an opportunity for consideration of new novel products. Western medicine can consider these things, but at the same time, we will need to know more about the mechanisms as well as the effect of each component of this compound.
