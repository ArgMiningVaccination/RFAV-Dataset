Today, with failing healthcare systems and disillusion with Western medicine, many more people are turning to the ancient methods and philosophies of Eastern medicine when looking for a holistic path to health. [There's no better place to begin an exploration into TCM than the East-meets-West melting pot of Hong Kong.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fambergibson%2F2017%2F10%2F17%2Fhunting-for-health-in-hong-kong%2F&text=Explore%20%23TCM%20in%20the%20East-meets-West%20melting%20pot%20of%20%23HongKong.%20%40discoverhk%20%23DiscoverHongKong%20%40HongKongTourism) \"We believe our mind, body and soul are all integrated,\" says Judy Xu, director of [Balance Health](http://www.balancehealth.com.hk/). \"Our body has the capability to heal itself. We use different modalities to support that healing.\" To understand the relationship between Eastern and Western medicine, the [Hong Kong Museum of Medical Sciences](http://www.hkmms.org.hk/en/home/) is a good place to start. The three-tier Edwardian brick building was originally home to the Bacteriological Institute, Hong Kong's first public health laboratory, established after the bubonic plague swept through Hong Kong in the late 19th century. An herbalist shop in the basement displays the tools and herbal, animal and mineral medicines that TCM practitioners used, while other exhibits explore the importance of the spleen in Chinese and Western medicine and the evolution of midwifery in Hong Kong. The [Dr. & Mrs. Hung Hin Shiu Museum of Chinese Medicine](http://cmmuseum.hkbu.edu.hk/eng/intro.html) delves even deeper into the heritage and historical origins of Chinese medicine, illustrating the importance of balancing the five elements and the principle of Yin and Yang. [Balance Health](http://www.balancehealth.com.hk/) was one of the first holistic health clinics in Hong Kong. The 20 specialists here offer everything from acupuncture, gua sha and cupping to sound healing meditation with Tibetan singing bowls. Dr. Clara Chan diagnosed me as having a dry fire body type after analyzing my pulse, studying my tongue and learning about my lifestyle. That means I am prone to having more warming Yang energy and not enough cooling Yin. She was then able to recommend foods and exercises to help me stay balanced, and warn me of potential impacts on my health - like dry skin and throat, irritability and trouble sleeping - when I am feeling out of balance. With my new understanding and knowledge, I set out to find indulgent experiences guided by TCM principles, from luxurious spa treatments to fine dining meals. At [The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong Spa](http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/china/hong-kong/spa), the signature Unwind Body and Mind experience uses acupressure and facial reflexology to harmonize the mind and body while [Chuan Spa](http://www.langhamhotels.com/en/chuan-spa/) at The Langham Hotel also uses acupressure to induce feelings of calm and relaxation in the popular harmony massage. Before beginning the massage, you'll take a short quiz to determine which of the five elements you most need to balance, with a corresponding breathing exercise and aromatherapy. I highly recommend both treatments as an antidote to jet lag. Dr. Chan recommends acupressure as a gentler alternative to acupuncture that you can even learn to practice on yourself.

Your guide to luxury travel\u2014and life's other indulgences. Some culinary ingredients, like the increasingly trendy goji berries, can also be used in topical spa applications. At the [Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong](http://www.fourseasons.com/hongkong/spa/), a phyto stem cell facial featuring Epicuren products includes a serum that uses goji berries, blood orange stem cells and dragon's blood extract to hydrate and regenerate the skin. These powerful botanicals plus skillful facial massage and lymphatic drainage act as an instant natural facelift. When it comes to beauty, bird's nest is the most prized ingredient to consume for better skin. The flavorless saliva of swiftlets is high in collagen and epidermal growth factor, which helps with skin and tissue repair. Most high-end Cantonese restaurants will have a section of the menu devoted to bird's nest soups, which are prepared in both sweet and savory varieties. [Man Wah](https://www.mandarinoriental.com/hong-kong/victoria-harbour/fine-dining/restaurants/cantonese-cuisine/man-wah) serves a simple warm rock sugar soup with a generous helping of bird's nest while [Tin Lung Heen](http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/china/hong-kong/dining/tin-lung-heen) offers a savory supreme broth with bird's nest-stuffed bamboo fungus. The Ritz-Carlton's elegant Chinese restaurant also mixes chicken stock with coconut water for its signature double-boiled chicken soup with fish maw in baby coconut. Fish maw is another sea delicacy that's said to foster Yin, invigorate blood circulation and improve complexion. At [T'ang Court](http://www.langhamhotels.com/en/the-langham/hong-kong/dining/tang-court/), fish maw and bird's nest are combined in a nourishing double-boiled chicken soup. Sea cucumber, pig's knuckles and peach tree jelly are also collagen-rich skin boosters. [Spring Moon](http://hongkong.peninsula.com/en/fine-dining/spring-moon-chinese-restaurant), which just received a Michelin star for the first time last year, makes an excellent double-boiled peach tree jelly soup with blood-nourishing red dates and longan for dessert. Dr. Chan recommends plant-based sources of collagen and sea cucumber as alternatives to ingredients like bird's nest and hasma that contain a lot of estrogen and other hormones. At [VEA,](http://vea.hk) the most adventurous course on the seasonal tasting menu consists of a roasted sea cucumber and langoustine mousse served over cordyceps and garlic chives with a rich langoustine reduction. According to TCM principles, sea cucumber nourishes the kidneys and blood while cordyceps supports liver and respiratory function and boosts the immune system. Young Cantonese-Canadian Chef Vicky Cheng cooks in a Chinese-French style that's both refined and innovative. He's a magician with sauces and includes Chinese sensibilities and local ingredients in each dish. Tea is another vital part of TCM, including herbal tonics and Chinese green, white, black and red teas. [MingCha Tea House](http://www.mingcha.com/) offer comprehensive tastings, including tea pairings with pastries and chocolate, for novices and connoisseurs alike. \"A lot of people misunderstand tea,\" Founder Vivian Mak explains. \"Here you can relax and be yourself - discover what you like. It's all about experience and sharing .\" Where To Stay [The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong](http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/china/hong-kong) is the highest hotel in the world, offering arguably the best service in the city and incredible views, especially from the 116th floor club lounge. The 90-second elevator ride to the 103rd floor lobby is just enough time to touch up lipstick. Plus, the hotel is conveniently located above the Elements shopping center and Kowloon MTR station. [The Peninsula Hong Kong ](http://hongkong.peninsula.com/en/default)in Tsim Sha Tsui still retains much of the historic facade and lobby d\u00e9cor from when the hotel first opened in 1928. However, the proprietary in-room technology is as modern as can be. Bedside tablets allow you to easily control all room functions and the in-room dining menu is tops. If you prefer to stay on Hong Kong island, the [Mandarin Oriental](https://www.mandarinoriental.com/hong-kong/victoria-harbour/luxury-hotel) is the grande dame, a favorite among business travelers since it opened in 1963. [The Landmark, Mandarin Oriental](https://www.mandarinoriental.com/hong-kong/the-landmark/luxury-hotel) next door is the more contemporary option, and a much smaller property. "}
