I have been seeing SFNM for 2 years and am very comfortable about their care. They go above and beyond for my health. I specifically come here for the IV treatments. They are also very serious about Covid and take all the protocols to be safe. - 3/17/2021 I'm sure they're good at some things but definitely had no idea what was going on with my GI issues. Schedule $300+ appointments to discuss normal lab results. Last time I was in he told me \"sorry, I don't know what's wrong with you\" and offered probiotics that made my insides explode. I received a call a few months later to schedule a follow up. Follow up for what? Spent well over $1000 with no answers. I finally requested a SIBO test on my own and tested positive and sought treatment elsewhere. - 8/31/2018 I've been seeing Dr. Claire Graser for only a short time, but I had a good sense of her from several GotVitaminB12 visits. Our first consultation at San Francisco Natural Medicine confirmed that she's everything one could want in a Naturopathic Doctor: she's knowledgeable, relaxed, friendly, and communicates clearly. I expect that she's well able to help guide me to optimal health and strength. The staff members at San Francisco Natural Medicine are also friendly and efficient. It's a pleasure to visit. - 9/23/2019 I have been a physician for over thirty years. I can honestly say that Dr. Carl Hangee-Bauer is one of the finest doctors that I have ever seen, including MDs, DOs, and NDs. He has a brilliant, logical mind, and an incredibly kind, attentive, and compassionate bedside manner. He actively listens extremely carefully and cares very much about what you are experiencing. He is the consummate professional. His office staff is superb - warm, friendly, helpful, and responsive. I give Dr. Hangee-Bauer and his San Francisco Natural Medicine staff my highest praise and recommendation possible. You will be very pleased with their care. - 10/2/2017 Dr. Carl Hangee-Bauer has been a life saver for me! I had sciatica and bad pain down my leg and it was preventing me from living life to it's fullest. After several months of pain, I went to see Dr. Carl for help. He took the time to understand my problem. I have been afraid of needles in the past, but I barely felt the needles when Dr. Carl placed them. Listening to classical music, I day dreamed and fell into a state of deep relaxation. Immediately after treatment, I felt hopeful. After about 24 hours, my leg pain was gone completely! It was amazing! What a relief! Since then, I have gone back to see Dr. Carl several times when I needed help with other issues. I am always happy with the results. If you think Dr. Carl could help you, call the office to arrange a consultation. We are lucky to have this office in Potrero Hill! - 10/15/2017 I will be forever grateful to Dr. Hangee-Bauer, his wife Michele, and Chloe for their true kindness in making it happen to see me asap even though they had a packed schedule on a Saturday after I was in a car accident/rearending and was in pain (in Nov 2016). I was a new patient and found them on Yelp with their high ratings and reviews. Dr. Hangee-Bauer's acupuncture treatment immediately gave me relief from back/neck pain from whiplash at a critical time. My chiropractor didn't open until Monday. I continued acu treatment with Dr. Hangee-Bauer for the following 4-5 months. I appreciate his compassionate bedside manner as well! - 7/31/2014 I read about Dr. Horowitz on Yelp, and I am so incredibly grateful I found her. My insurance doesn't cover her expenses, but my visits to her office have been worth every single penny. It is proving to be the best money I have ever spent. I suffered from severe anxiety for about 1 year, and I figured my only options were deep breathing, therapy and yoga. I was convinced my panic experiences were some kind of foreign invasion. All the physical manifestations of my stress and panic were completely unfamiliar, and totally unlike my usual self. I used to handle stress well, but somehow that was fading away. Dr. Horowitz greets you with a thorough consultation and chats with you for 2 hours. She is not looking for a quick cure, but a holistic solution to find out WHY you have your symptoms. Before she gives treatments, she wants to do extensive testing so she can provide a targeted solution. We did a round of neuroscience testing, and the results were fascinating. I learned so much about myself, and I felt really empowered by all this new knowledge from Dr. Horowitz. She put me on a specific amino acid regimen, and it changed my life. I started feeling like my old self again within 2 weeks. My quality of life improved so quickly, it was shocking. Her knowledge and approach is so refreshing in comparison to your traditional, western doctor. She takes the time to educate and empower her patients with valuable information. I trust her recommendations because I have witnessed first hand how powerful natural remedies can be. I was the ultimate skeptic in the past, but now I clearly see why the holistic approach can be game changing for improving my health. A fellow Yelper sharing their personal story is the reason I found my path to recovery with Dr. Erika Horowitz. I hope to pay it forward with my story! (ALSO - The girls at the front desk have always been extremely helpful and easy to talk to. The office handles everything with a great, friendly professionalism) - 5/4/2014 Dr. Erika Horowitz is a five star plus doctor. She has been successfully treating me for a GI problem that has been unsuccessfully treated by 4 Gastroenterologists (MD's), 3 nutritionists, 1 homeopath, 3 acupuncturists, and others over a period of 5.5 years. I am so grateful to be normal again. She is brilliant, methodical and nice. However, the remedy has taken several months and has been complex. So if you are looking for an instant magic pill it probably isn't here. - 3/10/2018 Beware . I had a terrible reaction and let the 'Dr.' know . No return phone call . Had to get a vaginal ultrasound at UCSF to make sure I was alright. - 5/28/2013 My only experience here is for BHRT. All I can say is STEER VERY CLEAR of Dr. Hangee Bauer if you want to be treated for Rhythmic BHRT. His prescription put me in a state of progesterone toxicity and he should be subject to a malpractice investigation. Hangee Bauer is an impostor and practicing a business of snake oil but prescribing dangerously debilitating meds without really understanding long term effects. Unfortunately, I learned the hard way, by experience, with this so called expert, how punishing a poorly designed protocol can be. I went into a chronic state of PMS as a direct result of high doses of progesterone he prescribed. First of all, he had me spend 120.00 out of pocket for a test that was unnecessary according to naturopaths and physicians I consulted after seeing Hangee-Bauer. After he received the results he asserted that I do not need E because I had enough in my system (this was a false statement -I learned this after he FINALLY sent me the results) he stated i only need progesterone (P). He put me on high doses of P with no E!! This is a reckless and incompetent protocol according to every BHRT practitioner I spoke with after seeing Hangee-Bauer (who I trusted). After going into a deep deep dark depression from his protocol I decided to call the compounding pharmacy and the pharmacist said \"wow you are on that much P all the time, and no E??\" \"That does not seem right. You need E! \" he said clearly \" Stop taking the p.\" He said \"Let's have a phone conf with Hangee Bauer next week!!\" I set up an appt. to discuss. Fast forward phone convo...Hangee Bauer prolonged a convo I already knew the outcome to based on the discussion with the pharmacist. I needed E as part of the protocol. SIMPLE, right? NO, he bled the convo for 45 minutes asking stupid questions like, should we put her on a bi-est after the pharmacist stated put her on a bi-est And, the convo ended as follows. Hangee Bauer stated \" well athina, it is up to you, what do you want\". WTF why am I seeing you!!! He said hold the line please I will get my assistant on for you to pay. His receptionist said \"165 please!!\" I said \"No way! This has to be a mistake. I paid hundreds of dollars so far, he put me on a bad prescription he should be paying me for his terrible mistake!! The receptionist asked me to hold the line and some aggressive female got on and in a bully tone said \"NO non negotiable you owe 165.\" I said but wait he got the prescription all wrong.she said well we did not charge you for the last phone call or email. I said you mean the one where I told him I was going into a deep dark depression and something is wrong with the mess you prescribed???\" Let me talk with him...she said he is not available. A few days later, adding insult to injury I received a letter stating Hangee Bauer found \"my\" behavior to his office manager unacceptable and that he was going to dismiss the cost of the last phone call (the 165.00) but he will no longer treat me. So...his office will suck up your money for poor, inexcusably incompetent quality of care and don't do anything to upset the gracious office manager because for free she will rip your head off. He does not know very much about rhythmic BHRT other then what his compounding pharmacy tells him. He is falsely advertising his expertise!! Explore More Options [read "}
