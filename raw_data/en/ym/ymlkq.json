Even though palliative care in Europe is often dated back to the so-called modern hospice movement, the medical care for the terminally ill and dying\u2014as opposed to a solely religious care by clergy\u2014has its roots in the early modern age. According to the World Health Organization's definition, palliative care features a certain set of ideologies: palliative care claims to provide holistic care, exhibits distinct ideals of a good death, and objects to assisted dying. Given that these ideologies allow for religious rationalization, palliative care constitutes a medical field in which medical and religious rationales may co-occur. Anthroposophic palliative care represents an ideal case study to show how religious beliefs enter the medical field, in this case by rationalizing core palliative care ideologies with anthroposophic medical conceptions.
