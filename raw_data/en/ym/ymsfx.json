INTRODUCTION This Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan was developed by the ADPH as a means to minimize employee exposure to human blood and other potentially infectious materials. It is designed to comply with the standards enunciated by the United States Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in Part 19101030, Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, \"Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens\". Each employee, whose work duties involve reasonably anticipated exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials, must become familiar with, and adhere to, the provisions of the Exposure Control Plan. In order to promote this objective, a copy of the plan shall be readily accessible to all employees. In this facility the plan w ill be available from: ______________________________________________________________________________ (name/position) This plan will be reviewed and updated at least annually and whenever necessary to reflect new or modified tasks and procedures whi ch would affect occupational exposure. In addition, it will be updated as necessary to reflect new or revised employee positions which have been ascertained to be at potential occupational risk to exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Within each county h ealth department one or more individuals will have the authority and responsibility for the implementation of this plan. The person(s) responsible for ______________________________ County is (are): ______________________________________________________________________________ (name/position) ___/___/___ (Effective date of this Exposure Control Plan) Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Plan 4 February 2013 II. DEFINITIONS These definitions apply throughout this plan: \"BLOOD\" means human blood, human blood components, and products made from human blood. \"BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS\" refers to pathogenic microorganisms that are present in human blood and can cause disease in humans. These pathogens include, but are not limited to, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and h uman immunodeficiency virus (HIV). \"CLINICAL LABORATORY\" means a workplace where diagnostic or other screening procedures are performed on blood or other potentially infectious materials. \"CONTAMINATED\" means the presence, or the reasonably anticipated presence, of blood or other potentially infectious materials on an item or surface. \"CONTAMINATED LAUNDRY\" means laundry which has been soiled with blood or other potentially infectious materials or which may contain sharps. \"CONTAMINATED SHARPS\" means any contaminated object that can penetrate the skin including, but not limited to, needles, scalpels, broken glass, broken capillary tubes, and exposed ends of dental wires. \"DECONTAMINATE\" means the use of physical or chemical means to remove, inactivate, or destroy bloodborne pathogens on a surface or item to the point where they are no longer capable of transmitting infectious particles and the surface or item is rendered safe for handling, use, or disposal. \"ENGINEERING CONTROLS\" are those controls which isolate or remove the blood borne pathogens hazard from the workplace (sharps disposal containers and self - sheathing needles). Safer medical devices such as sh arps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems must be used where feasible. \"EXPOSURE INCIDENT\" means a specific eye, mouth, or other mucous membrane, non-intact skin, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infec tious materials that results from the performance of an employee's duties. \"HBV\" means Hepatitis B virus. \"HCV\" means Hepatitis C virus Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Plan 5 February 2013 \"HIV\" means Human Immunodeficiency Virus. \"NEEDLELESS SYSTEMS\" means devices which provide an alterna tive to using needles for various procedures in order to reduce the risk of injury involving contaminated sharps. Examples include: IV medication systems which administer medication or fluids through a catheter port using non- needle connections; and Jet injection systems which deliver liquid medication beneath the skin or through a muscle. \"OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE\" means reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may result from the performance of an employee's duties. \"OTHER POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS MATERIAL\" (OPIM) means: the following human body fluids: semen, vaginal secreti ons, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva, any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids; any unfixed tissue or organ (other than intact skin) from a human (living or dead); and HIV-containing cell s or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV, HCV or HBV - containing culture medium or other solutions; and blood, organs, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV, HCV or HBV. \"PARENTERAL\" means piercing mucous membranes or the skin barrier through such events as needlesticks, human bites, cuts, and abrasions. \"PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQ UIPMENT\" means specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee for protection against a hazard. General work clothes (e.g., uniforms, pants, shirts or blouses) not intended to function as protection against a hazard are not considered to be personal protective equipment. \"REGULATED WASTE\" means liquid or semi -liquid blood or other potentially infectious materials; contaminated items that would release blood or other potentially infectious materials in a liquid or semi- liquid state if compressed; items that are caked with dried blood or other potentially infectious materials and are capable of releasing these materials during handling; contaminated sharps; and pathological and microbiological wastes containing blood or othe r potentially infectious materials. \"SHARPS WITH ENGINEERED SHARPS INJURY PROTECTIONS \" (SESIPS) includes non- needle sharps or needle devices containing built -in safety features that are used for collecting fluids or administering medications or ot her fluids, or other procedures involving the risk of sharps injury. Examples include: needles that retract into a syringe after use, syringes with a sliding sheath that shields the attached needle after Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Plan 6 February 2013 use, and IV delivery systems that use a catheter port with a needle housed in a protective covering. \"SOURCE INDIVIDUAL\" means any person, living or dead, whose blood or other potentially infectious materials may be a source of occupational exposure to the employee. Examples include, but are not limited to, hospital and clinic patients, clients in institutions for the developmentally disabled, trauma victims, clients of drug and alcohol treatment facilities, residents of hospices and nursing homes , human remains, and individuals who donate or sell blood or blood components. \"STANDARD PRECAUTIONS\" formerly referred to as Universal Precautions, is an approach to infection control in which all human blood and certain human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens. \"STERILIZE\" means the use of a physical or chemical procedure to destroy all microbial life including highly resistant bacterial endospores. \"WORK PRACTICE CONTROLS\" means controls that reduce the likelihood of employee exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials by altering the manner in which a task is performed (e.g., use of sharps with engineered sharps injury protection whenever possible ). III. EXPOSURE DETERMINATION The ADPH has performed an exposure determination concerning which employees may be at risk to incur occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials. This determination was made without regard to th e use of personal protective equipment (e.g. employees are considered to be exposed even if they wear personal protective equipment.) This exposure determination lists all job classifications in which all employees may be expected to incur such occupational exposure, regardless of frequency. Within ADPH the following job class ifications are in this category: Physicians Personal Care Attendants Dental Assistants Nurses Biomedical Engineer Technicians Dental Hygienists Nurses Aides (State Lab) Disease Intervention Specialists (home health & clinic) Laboratory Technicians HIV Field Staff Home Care Therapists Microbiologists Immunization DIS Homemakers Dentists STD DIS Home Attendants Nutritionists TB DIS Emergency Preparedness Coordinators Shelter Teams In addition, OSHA requires a listing of job classifications in which some employees may have occupational exposure. Since not all of the employees in these categories would be Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Plan 7 February 2013 expected to incur exposure to bl ood or other potentially infectious materials, tasks or procedures that would cause these employees to have occupational exposure are listed in order to clearly understand which employees in these categories are considered to have occupational exposure. The job classifications and associated tasks for these categories are as follows: JOB CLASSIFICATION TASKS/PROCEDURES 1. Laboratory clerical personnel In a Laboratory environment: a. Open packages containing specimens b. Handle report forms when entering data 2. Clinical and Home Health a. Handle specimens during labeling and Clerical personnel packaging process (in some counties) 3. Janitorial/Housekeeping a. Clean up spills Laborers b. Handle identified medical waste/sharps during disposal process IV. STANDARD PRECAUTIONS Standard Precautions will be observed by each employee in order to prevent contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials. V. 2001 NE EDLESTICK SAFETY AND PREVENTION ACT This Federal law requires employers to identify and make use of effective and safer medical devices that eliminate or reduce employee exposure to bloodborne pathogens. The Act has the following components which will be adhered to in this facility: Exposure Control Plan: The Exposure Control Plan will be annually reviewed and updated to reflect changes in technology that eliminate or reduce exposure to bloodborne pathogens. The review and follow -up will include: Taking into account innovations in medical procedure and technological developments that reduce the risk of exposure (e.g., devices designed to reduce needlesticks); and, Documenting any consideration and use of appropriate commercially -available and effective safer devices (e.g., describe the devices identified as candidates for use, the method(s) used to evaluate those devices, and justification for the eventual selection). Devices will be selected based on reasonable judgment considering dev ices which: will not jeopardize patient or employee safety or be medically inadvisable; and Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Plan 8 February 2013 will make an exposure incident involving a contaminated sharp less likely to occur. Employee Input: Input from non- managerial employees, responsible for direct patient care, will be solicited regarding the identification, evaluation, and selection of effective engineering controls, including safer medical devices. Documentation of employee input, in the Exposure Control Plan, can be met by: listing the employees involved and describing the process by which input was requested; or presenting other documentation such as copies of documents used to request employee participation or records of responses received from employees. Recordke eping: Employees, who are occupationally exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials, must document on the incident report: the type and brand of device involved in the incident; location of the incident; and a description of the incident. A copy of this report must be sent to the ADPH Infection Prevention Officer. A separate medical file for each employee that is marked \"PHI\" is to be kept in each county health department and incident reports should be file d here and not in the employee's personnel file. VI. ENGINEERING AND WORK PRACTICE CONTROLS Engineering and work practice controls will be utilized to eliminate or minimize exposure to employees at the health department facilities. Where occupation al exposure remains after institution of these controls, personal protective equipment will also be utilized. These engineering and work practice controls will be examined for effectiveness on a _______________________ (time interval) basis and mai ntained or replaced.
