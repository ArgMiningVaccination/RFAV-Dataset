UC IRVINE - 1981-19822 Explanatory Notes The UCI General Catalogue contains general administrative and academic information, as well as specific descriptions of schools and departments and the courses they offer. Because the Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the year it covers, changes in some programs inevitably will occur. Courses described in the Catalogue are subject to change with\u00ad out notice, and some listed courses are not offered each year. The quarterly Schedule of Classes, a publication available from the Registrar's Office shortly before enrollment begins each quarter, provides information on classes to be offered, instruc\u00ad tors, enrollment restrictions (for example, major only), class hours, room assignments, and examination schedules. Students should consult the appropriate academic unit for current infor\u00ad mation. Admission to UCI does not guarantee admission to any particular course. Course Listings. Undergraduate courses are classified as \"lower division\" and \"upper \"upper division\" refers to courses numbered 100-199. Courses numbered 200 and above are graduate courses. \"Lower division\" usually refers to freshman\u00ad sophomore courses, \"upper division\" to junior-senior courses. However, junior and senior students may take lower-division courses, and freshmen and sophomores may normally take upper-division courses when upper-division standing is not a\u00b7 prerequisite. Prerequisites for courses should be noted carefully; a course has no prerequisites unless indicated. Courses with sequential designations (for example, lA-B-C) normally indicate multiple-quarter courses; except as noted, each course in a sequence is prerequisite to the one following. The letter L following a course number usually designates a laboratory course. . The \"(4)\" or \"(4-4-4)\" designation following the course title indicates the unit credits toward the 180 quarter units needed to graduate. Each \"4\" represents four quarter units. The letters F, W, or S after the course number and title indicate the quarter(s) in which the course will be offered: fall, winter, or spring. The word Summer appears if the course is offered in Summer Session, 1981. While efforts have been made to pro\u00ad vide information on when a course is offered, such information is not always available in time for inclusion in the Catalogue. The designation ( 4) F, W, S indicates a single course offered each quarter which can be taken only once for credit; a ( 4-4-4) F, W, S designation indicates that credit may be earned in each quarter. When a course is approved for satisfaction of the UCI breadth requirement, the breadth category is indicated by a roman numeral at the end of the course description. A description of the breadth requirement may be found on page 15. INTRODUCTION TOUCI THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA David S. Saxon President The University of California was chartered as the State's only Land Grant College in 1868. Throughout its first decades, the University's development was strongly influenced by leading educators and scholars from various parts of the country. Sup\u00ad ported by the State and many generous benefactors, the Univer\u00ad sity was responsive to the needs of California while progressing on a steady climb toward eminence in academic and scientific achievement. Today the University system includes nine campuses-Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. All of the campuses adhere to the same admissions guidelines and high academic standards, yet each one has its own distinct character. Among the campuses there are five medical schools, three law schools, and a school of veterinary medicine, as well as professional schools of busi\u00ad ness administration, education, engineering, oceanography, and many others. The University's libraries are among the finest in the United States. In just over a century, the University has become one of the world's largest and most renowned centers of higher education. The faculty is internationally noted for its distinguished aca\u00ad demic achievements. On its nine campuses, the University has a total of 15 Nobel laureates. National Academy of Science membership on all campuses numbers 195-greater than the total for any other college or university system. The University maintains a variety of research facilities, agricul\u00ad tural field stations, and extension centers in more than 100 locations throughout California. Public services include medical and dental clinics, information services for agricultural and urban populations, and a broad program of continuing educa\u00ad tion for adults in the arts, business, and professions. Under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy and with support from other agencies, the University operates three national research facilities: the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory adjoining the Berkeley campus, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at Livermore, California, and the Los Alamos National Scientific Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Other major research facilities include Lick Observa\u00ad tory, White Mountain Research Station for high-altitude research, Laboratory of Radio Astronomy, Bodega Marine Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Institute of Transportation Studies, Statewide Air Pollution Research Cen\u00ad ter, Space Sciences Laboratory, Hormone Research Center, and Philip L. Boyd Desert Research Center, among others. One of the University's unique resources is its roster of Univer\u00ad sity Professors. The University Professor title is reserved for certain distinguished faculty members who are recognized nationally and internationally as scholars and teachers of excep\u00ad tional ability. A University Professor may visit a number of University of California campuses during the academic year, holding conferences with students and staff and speaking before general public audiences. A list of University Professors may be found on page 261. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982UC IRVINE - 1981-19824 TilE IRVINE CAMPUS \u00b71 THE IRVINE CAMPUS University Administration. Under the State Constitution, governance of the University is entrusted to the Board of Regents. The Regents appoint the President of the University, and with the President's advice, appoint the Chancellors, Direc\u00ad tors of major laboratories, Provosts, and Deans who administer the affairs of the individual campuses and other divisions of the University. Authority in academic matters is delegated by The Regents to the Academic Senate, which determines academic policy for the University as a whole. The Board of Regents includes seven ex officio board members, and 18 regular members who are appointed by the Governor for 12-year terms after consultation with an advisory commit\u00ad tee. In addition, The Regents appoint a student Regent for a one-year term as a voting Board member with full rights of par\u00ad ticipation. A constitutional amendment provides that \"Regents shall be able persons broadly reflective of the economic, cul\u00ad tural, and social diversity of the State, including ethnic minori\u00ad ties and women.\" They shall have \"full powers of organization and government, subject only to such legislative controls as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the endowments of the University and the security of its funds.\" ' The President is executive head of the total institution. Each of the nine campuses has a Chancellor as its chief administrative officer. The Chancellor is responsible for the organization and operation of the campus, including academic, student, and bus\u00ad iness affairs. For the names of University Regents, Officers, and Chancellors, see page 260. The Academic Senate, consisting of faculty and certain adminis\u00ad trative officers, determines the conditions for admission and degrees, subject to the approval of The Regents, authorizes and supervises courses and curricula, and advises the University administration on the important matters of faculty appoint\u00ad ments and promotions and budgets. Students participate in policymaking at both the campus and Systemwide levels. Daniel G. Aldrich, Jr. Chancellor The University of California, Irvine has achieved distinction nationally and internationally because of the high quality of its programs, faculty, and alumni. The campus challenges its stu\u00ad dents both academically and personally and relies on the com\u00ad mitment, curiosity, imagination, and judgment of faculty and students to assure its continued intellectual and cultural vitality. Since the campus opened in 1965, enrollment has grown to approximately 10,200, including 7,700 undergraduate students, 1,400 graduate students, and 1,000 medical students and residents. Academic Goals The University of California, Irvine offers programs designed to provide students with a foundation on which to continue developing their intellectual, aesthetic, and moral capacities. The programs and curricula are based on the belief that a stu\u00ad dent's collectit'e university experience should provide under\u00ad standing and insight which are the basis for an intellectual iden\u00ad tity and life-long learning. An important aspect of the educational approach at UCI is the emphasis placed on student involvement in independent study, research, and the creative process as a complement to classroom study. Independent research in laboratories, field study, involve\u00ad ment in writing workshops, and participation in fine arts pro\u00ad ductions are normal elements of the UCI experience. In many departments special programs and courses which involve stu\u00ad dents in original research and creative activities are integrated into the curriculum. The Irvine campus provides an atmosphere conducive to crea\u00ad tive work and scholarship at all levels, to the exploration of the accumulated knowledge of mankind, and to the development of new knowledge through basic and applied research. Along with these objectives, Irvine has a serious commitment to public service. The campus generates research expertise which may be applied to regional and national social issues, and seeks to provide humanistic understanding of the problems of society. Academic Structure Instruction and research programs at UCI focus on fundamental areas of knowledge, while at the same time provide for interdis\u00ad ciplinary and professional study. Five basic Schools represent five fundamental areas of knowledge: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Pro\u00ad grams covering interdisciplinary and professional studies are offered in the Department of Information and Computer Science, the Program in Social Ecology, the School of Engineer\u00ad ing, the Graduate School of Management, and the Office of Teacher Education. The College of Medicine provides educa\u00ad tional programs for medical and health sciences graduate stu\u00ad dents, medical residents, and practicing physicians. Programs in physical education, recreation, and intercollegiate athletics are provided by the Department of Physical Education. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982TilE IRVINE CAMPUS 5 UC IRVINE - 1981-19826 lliE IRVINE CAMPUS The Office of Academic Affairs is responsible for all programs of instruction and research. Matters of educational policy, including approval of programs, courses, and grades, are the responsibility of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. The Irvine Division is part of the Academic Senate of the Uni\u00ad versity of California. Accreditation The University of California, Irvine is a member of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The campus is fully accredited by the Senior Commission of WASC. This accreditation requires periodic review in accord with WASC policies and standards. In addition, the undergraduate degree program of the Department of Chemistry is accredited by the American Chemical Society; the undergraduate Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering options of the School of Engineer\u00ad ing are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology; the M.D. program of the College of Medicine is accredited by the Liaison Committee of the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Associa\u00ad tion; and the credential programs of the Office of Teacher Edu\u00ad cation are approved by the Commission for Teacher Prepara\u00ad tion and Licensing. Affirmative Action Office The UCI Affirmative Action Office develops and supports pro\u00ad grams which promote affirmative action and equal opportunity in University employment, services, and education for qualified minorities, women, handicapped persons, and Vietnam Era veterans. Additionally, the Office implements systems and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with Titles VI and VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Title IX of the Educa\u00ad tional Amendments to the Act. The Office is responsible for assuring fair and equal treatment in University admissions policies, educational programs and activities, and in both undergraduate and graduate student affirmative action programs. The Office also coordinates stu\u00ad dent affirmative action plans. For further information, contact the UCI Affirmative Action Office, 117 Administration, (714) 833-5594. The Campus Setting UCI's location offers the cultural and economic resources of an urban area along with access to the scenic, recreational areas of Southern California. Located 40 miles south of Los Angeles, five miles from the Pacific Ocean, and nestled in 1,500 acres of coastal foothills near Newport Beach, UCI lies amid rapidly growing residential communities and a dynamic national and multinational business and industrial complex that affords many employment opportunities. Even so, from the main campus entrance at Gateway Plaza, the campus is seen as an oasis of green-a natural arboretum planted with trees and shrubs from all over the world. Adjacent to the campus lies UCI's outdoor laboratory, the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, which is home to a wide variety of migratory and nonmigratory water fowl and other wildlife. The UCI Medical Center, located in the City of Orange on a 31-acre site, is a major teaching hospital for the College of Med\u00ad icine. As part of a major renovation program, the Medical Cen\u00ad ter opened a six-level Medical Center Tower in spring 1981 to provide space for many of the varied activities at this compre\u00ad hensive health education, service, and research facility. Within a few miles of the campus are major department stores; branches of classic European, San Francisco, and New York shops; dozens of outstanding restaurants, many offering a vari\u00ad ety of cuisines from other countries; and major hotels. Cultural opportunities in the county include repertory theatres, orches\u00ad tras, choral groups, dance companies, galleries, and museums. The John Wayne Airport, third busiest in the nation, is two miles from campus. Yet, in part, the Irvine area retains some of its traditional char\u00ad acter as a beach-although not a sleepy-resort. The Portuguese dory fishing fleet at Newport, one of the last private fleets on the West Coast, comes ashore every morning and evening to sell the day's catch, and the sun and surf crowd mingle with the art and\u00b7 artisan crowd at Laguna Beach during the summer and winter festivals. The temperate, Mediterranean climate stimulates year-round water-oriented activities such as windsurf\u00ad ing, sailing, and tidepooling. The spring, summer, fall, and win\u00ad ter find students-many of whom live in the nearby beach communities of Balboa Island, Balboa Peninsula, and Newport Beach-enjoying the warm sun and gentle sea breezes. Boating enthusiasts set sail in Newport Bay in 14-to 30-foot sailboats or in canoes, both available from the UCI Sailing Club. Local mountain and desert recreation areas are within easy reach, and the UCI Cooperative Outdoor Program provides low-cost ren\u00ad tal equipment for hiking, and skiing, and instruction for other recreational pursuits. The metropolitan attractions of Los Angeles and San Diego are an hour's drive from the campus. Bus transportation between the campus and major housing areas, shopping centers, and beaches is convenient, and bi\u00ad cycling is popular. Both the campus and the surrounding com\u00ad munities are designed to encourage bicycle traffic, and trails connect UCI to many student housing areas and to the water\u00ad front areas of Newport Beach. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Instructional and Research Facilities University Library The UCI Library is a component of the extensive University of California Library system, whose libraries contain more than 15 million volumes. These libraries are committed to a resource\u00ad sharing plan which will strengthen the resource base and useful\u00ad ness of UCI's own library system. Established in 1963, the UCI Library collection has been carefully selected and developed in conjunction with the campus academic plan. The UCI Library system includes the Main Library, the Physical Sciences Library, and the Biomedical Library. This important resource for study, teaching, and research contains approximately one million volumes, including almost 12,000 currently active serials sub\u00ad scriptions. Except for those materials which comprise the Medi\u00ad cal Center Branch Library, all of these volumes are housed on the general campus. In addition, a student may request books from other University of California libraries and from national and international libraries. The Main Library is designed to provide maximum shelving and reader space. With the exception of materials housed in special units, all periodicals and books are on open shelves and easily accessible to all readers. The following Library departments provide specialized services to the users of the Main Library. The Reference Department contains an open-shelf collection numbering some 25,000 volumes. Librarians in the Reference Department assist in the use of the reference tools and are pre\u00ad pared to find answers for a wide variety of library and campus questions. Informal instruction and guides designed for specific service areas are available. Formal instruction is offered through a course which introduces students to library research tech\u00ad niques (Humanities 75: Biblio Strategy). Bibliographical ses\u00ad sions for classes can be arranged by application at the Reference Desk. The Government Publications Department contains a collection of over 400,000 publications issued by the U.S. government, Canada, the State of California, and international organizations. This department also contains the Orange County Public Affairs Collection, a resource of current documents on local affairs issued by both governmental and nongovernmental agencies. The Department of Special Collections contains noncirculating holdings of rare books and early printed works, noteworthy or finely printed editions, exceptionally costly or fragile items, and manuscripts. Special subject collections include French litera\u00ad ture of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Rene Wel\u00ad lek collection of the history of criticism, California history and literature, British naval history, contemporary poetry, dance, historical costume, and political pamphlet literature. The University Archives, which shares quarters with the Department of Special Collections, is the official repository for records having permanent value in documenting the history of the UCI campus. These include publications and other records of administrative and academic units, student organizations, and campus support groups. TilE IRVINE CAMPUS 7 The Learning Resources Center collects, organizes, and makes available to library users nonprint materials which support campus academic programs. The Center also houses the David S. Saxon collection of recorded music which contains cassette tapes of classical and other music. The Center provides a play\u00ad back area which allows for on-site consultation of materials in its collection. Terminals connected to campus computers are also available, along with an audio cassette tape duplication service and a media classroom. The Center provides a media reference and advisory service to the campus, and arranges for the rental of films used for instructional purposes on campus. A collection of film classics is also retained here. The Serials Department includes a reading room in which cur\u00ad rent periodical and journal issues are on display. This depart\u00ad ment also provides reference service on microform collections housed in the microform room. This room is equipped with a variety of microform readers and has facilities for copying from microfilm and microfiche. The Main Library Copying Service, supplemented by coin\u00ad operated copying machines, makes it possible to obtain repro\u00ad duction service at all times when the Main Library is open. Required or collateral reading materials are placed in the Reserve Book Room by faculty members for their students. Reserve materials circulate for short periods of time and are listed on computer-produced lists by course numbers. Other Main Library facilities include group study rooms, coin\u00ad operated typewriters, individual study seating, book lockers, and rooms containing study aids for blind and partially sighted students. When the University is in session, the Main Library is open 90 hours per week. The Physical Sciences Library is located in the Physical Sciences Building, and contains over 54,000 volumes on mathematics, physics, astronomy, and chemistry. The collection includes over 1,000 current serial titles. Hours of service are the same as those in the Main Library, and copying services are available. The Biomedical Library (formerly the Medical Sciences Library) is located in the College of Medicine, and contains a collection of some 104,000 volumes of medical and biological literature, with subscriptions to 1,600 serial titles. Among the audiovisual services provided are microform reader/printers, video tape players, and slide projectors with tape players. Access is also p~ovided for over 100 data bases for general information as well as Medline. The Biological Sciences branch of the Biomedical Library is located in the Science Lecture Hall, with a large col\u00ad lection of current journals. In addition, the Library for the Museum of Systematic Biology, which is located in the Engi\u00ad neering Building, provides a reference collection for systematic biology and for the identification of plants and animals. The Medical Center Library is located at the University of Cali\u00ad fornia Irvine Medical Center. Its collection includes 25,000 volumes and 700 current serial subscriptions. This library serves primarily as the library for the Medical Center and is part of the campus library resources. UC IRVINE - 1981-19828 THE IRVINE CAMPUS Modern methods for increasing the speed and efficiency of library service have been or are being installed throughout the UCI Library system. The Library subscribes to a computer\u00ad based cataloging service which enables it to make books avail\u00ad able rapidly. A computer-based circulation system is installed in all libraries. On-line literature searching ser~ces are offered in a variety of machine-readable data bases. Information on this ser\u00ad vice may be obtained at the reference desks in all libraries. Interlibrary loan service is available on a national and interna\u00ad tional basis to all faculty, students, and staff. Bus service to UCLA is offered Monday through Saturday for faculty and students who need to use the UCLA libraries. Computing Facility The Computing Facility provides interactive and batch comput\u00ad ing services to students, faculty, and staff on three multi-user computer systems (a Xerox Sigma-7, a Digital Equipment Cor\u00ad poration DECsystem-10, and a DEC PDP-11/45) and a dozen single-user graphic microcomputer systems (Terak 8510/a's). Computing at UCI is distinguished by the commitment to make computing an integral part of the academic programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, and by the commitment to extensive use of interactive computing. Approximately 40 percent of the students are involved with some form of instruc\u00ad tional computing every year. The Facility can serve more than 140 interactive users simultaneously on its three multi-user systems. A data communications network provides access to any of these three systems from over 150 terminals available to students in public terminal areas. The network also serves private offices throughout the campus and can support access to departmental computers used in various research projects. A wide variety of programming languages and applications packages is available to users. Limited capabilities are available for remote computing at other campuses and laboratories of the University. The Facility provides orientation sessions and instructional seminars on various aspects of using the local sys\u00ad tems. Regular instruction in programming and other aspects of computing is provided by the Department of Information and Computer Science, other academic units, and University Extension. Information about campus computing services is available at the Computing Facility's Office of Production Services, 364 Com~ puter Science Building. Education Abroad Program Qualified UCI students who desire to live and study in a foreign country for one year are eligible to apply for the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP). Study abroad allows students to expe\u00ad rience vastly different cultures and contrasting patterns of think\u00ad ing while making progress toward a UC degree. Students pay for normal UC fees as well as for room and board, transportation, and books. Usually students selected for the program have had two years of college-level language preparation. In addition, EAP participants are enrolled in an intensive language course during the first several weeks abroad, followed by regular courses at the host university. Universities participating in the Education Abroad Program are located in Austria, Brazil, Egypt, France, Germany, Ghana, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Norway, Peru, Spain, Sweden, Togo, the United Kingdom and Ireland, and the USSR. For further information please contact the Education Abroad Program, (714) 833-6343. Laser Microbeam Program The Laser Microbeam Program (LAMP) was established on the Irvine campus in 1979 as a national facility in the area of laser microbeam biotechnology. LAMP functions as a research, train\u00ad ing, and service facility, and provides interaction between the laser industry and the academic biomedical research commun\u00ad ity. The facility serves as a resource to promote research in cell biology, developmental biology, neurobiology, genetics, and oncology. Microsurgery is performed at subcellular, cellular, and tissue levels. The program is conducted in the School of Biological Sciences and is funded through a grant from the Bio\u00ad technology Resources Program of the National Institutes of Health. . Natural Land and Water Reserves System The University of California manages and maintains a system of more than 20 reserves that are representative of the State's habi\u00ad tat and geographic diversity. These serve as outdoor laboratories for students, faculty, and staff, and are intended primarily for purposes of education and research. The reserves are adminis\u00ad tered by local campus management committees who control their uses. The Irvine campus is responsible for two Reserves: the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve and the Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve. San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve The San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, one of the last remaining freshwater marshes of southern California, is a 202-acre reserve adjacent to the Irvine campus. The Marsh con\u00ad sists of a series of freshwater ponds and their attendant aquatic flora and fauna, and is especially known for its rich bird life, both resident and migratory. Researchers and observers have recorded as many as 90 species of birds in the Reserve, a major stopping point on the Pacific Flyway. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982UC IRVINE - 1981-1982!OTHE IRVINE CAMPUS Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve The Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve is located near the town of Yucca Valley in San Bernardino County. It is a 265-acre parcel of high-desert habitat representing an ecotone between montane and desert biota, with mixtures ofJoshua tree, pinon pine, and juniper woodland. The Reserve has primitive camping facilities, and is used primarily for overnight field trips and research by faculty and students from the School of Biological Sciences. Irvine Arboretum The Arboretum is a botanical garden developed and managed by the School of Biological Sciences. It contains areas planted with floras adapted to climates similar to those of southern California, and a native flora section. The Arboretum maintains a program devoted to the conservation of African monocot floras and contains several important collections of rare plants. Certain research and instructional materials are grown. The Arboretum collections are also used as an educational resource for the community at large. Volunteers and other interested par\u00ad ties are encouraged to participate in Arboretum activities. Museum of Systematic Biology The Museum of Systemati~ Biology is a scientific resource charged with cataloging and maintaining specimens of local plants and animals. Its holdings, totaling over 120,000 speci\u00ad mens, provide environmental scientists and students of ecology with information about the occurrence, identification, and dis- tribution of the species living in our immediate environment. In addition to its general holdings, the Museum is custodian for three outstanding special collections: the Sprague Conchological Collection, the Cassady- Lewis Herpetological Collection, and the Rudkin Lepidopteran Collection. UCI Medical Center and Community Clinics The UCI Medical Center (UCIMC) is a fully accredited general and emergency care hospital located in the City of Orange. UCI College of Medicine faculty and resident physicians are the pro\u00ad fessional staff for medical services at the Center; a full comple\u00ad \u00b7ment of inpatient and outpatient services in virtually all medical specialties is offered. The Medical Center is also the designated Countywide Level I tertiary trauma referral center. \u00b7 The Center serves as a principal facility for teaching and re\u00ad search programs for medical students, providing them with direct involvement in patient care. Licensed for 493 beds, the Medical Center currently handles 17,000 inpatient admissions, 143,000 outpatient visits, and 45,000 adult and pediatric emer\u00ad gency visits. A major redevelopment program is underw;ty at the Medical Center to provide an enhanced professional, functional, and a more attractive environment for patient care and educational programs. In spring 1981, the six-level Medical Center Tower opened; it houses diagnostic radiology services, emergency and trauma facilities, obstetrical facilities, and private and semi\u00ad private patient rooms. The redevelopment program includes plans for renovating existing buildings, removing out-dated structures, and constructing new facilities, including a medical library. The library is planned as the first component of a pro\u00ad posed modular facility system that will include buildings for inpatient and outpatient diagnostic services and for instructional and research programs. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982UCI clinical facilities also include the Community Clinic of Orange County (CCOC) in Santa Ana and the North Orange Counry Community Clinic (NOCCC) in Anaheim. Both clinics provide educational experiences and patient services in primary care. Important components of UCI's medical education and re\u00ad search programs are also conducted at affiliated hospitals and clinics, in particular, the Veterans Administration Medical Cen\u00ad ter, Long Beach; Memorial Hospital Medical Center, Long Beach; and Childrens Hospital of Orange County. For further information about University-operated clinical facil\u00ad ities and other facilities associated with the UCI Clinical Serv\u00ad ices System, see the College of Medicine section.

Normally a student took six four-unit (standard or full) courses in one school outside the major and three four-unit (standard or full) courses in each of two other schools outside the major (referred to as the UCI 6-3-3 distri\u00ad bution). The requirement did not apply to students majoring in Engineering. All students planning to transfer to UCI should see page 40 for details on fulfilling the UCI breadth requirement. Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. School and Departmental Requirements In addition to the University requirements listed above, each undergraduate student must satisfy the degree requirements for the major selected. UCI, school, and departmental or major requirements may overlap; courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement (e.g., the physics course requirement in the School of Biological Sciences) may also help fulfill the UCI breadth requirement. Information on specific school and departmental or major degree requirements, as well as courses offered, can be found elsewhere in this Catalogue. The student should have determined an area of concentration no later than the beginning of the junior year, having made cer\u00ad tain that the background and the preparation prerequisite to junior and senior work in the major have been accomplished. New and continuing undergraduate students should read the section on Planning an Undergraduate Program; transfer stu\u00ad dents should also read the section on Planning for Transfer to UCI.

UC IRVINE - 1981-1982PLANNING AN UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Choosing a Major Many students select their University major-the field of study which represents their principal academic interest...:....at the time they fill out their University of California Undergraduate Appli\u00ad cation. Some students, however, are not ready to choose a major at the time they apply, and still others may wish to change to a different major after they have enrolled. (Students interested in a major from the School of Humanities should be aware that students do not select a specific major within that School until late in the sophomore year, in order to assure that they have opportunities to explore the various disciplines represented in the School.) In preparation for choosing a major, students need to familiarize themselves as much as possible with UCI and its many programs. Entering students are exposed to a wide range of areas of study, and it is not unusual for students to become enthusiastic about academic disciplines previously unfamiliar to them. Much depends on initiative-on how fully a student takes advantage of opportunities that come through suggestions for further study and through informal communica\u00ad tion with faculty and students. All students are expected to choose a major by _the beginning of the junior year. It is important to look well ahead to this deci\u00ad sion and to think about it carefully during the freshman and sophomore years. When considering possible majors, students need to keep in mind that some major programs require quite specific preliminary study. At the same time, excessive early concentration could reduce a student's options and prevent moving to a major in a different field. Furthermore, courses required for graduation need to be considered~ For these reasons, it is desirable for students to plan their programs care\u00ad fully and thoughtfully, seeking a balance between exposure to a variety of academic areas and completion of courses which are prerequisite to a major under consideration. A qualified student interested in two areas of study may graduate with a double major by fulfilling the degree requirements of any two programs. The General Catalogue is a good place to find specific inform;~\u00ad tion about programs available, requirements for majors, and course offerings. At UCI a number of traditionally separate academic disciplines have strong interrelationships, so that the academic environment is influenced by a wide range of interac\u00ad tions among disciplines. As a complement to classroom study, UCI encourages its students to become involved in a variety of educational experiences such as independent study, laboratory research, field study, writing workshops, computing, and fine arts productions. In addition to consulting the Catalogue, students are encouraged to talk to academic counselors and faculty advisors about the opportunities which are open to them. They may go to any department in order to learn more about its programs of study, its requirements for graduation, and possible enrollment limita\u00ad tions. While advisors may not be familiar with all fields, they can suggest ways to investigate other areas of study and be help\u00ad ful in planning a lower-division program which will keep several options open. PLANNING AN UNDERGRADUATE PROORAM. 19 Once a student decides on a major, the actual procedure to formalize the decision is not complicated. A form called the \"Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major\" must be com\u00ad pleted whenever a student who has no major is ready to declare one, or whenever a student wishes to change from one major to another. The form is available from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. Academic Advising At the time of admis-sion every undergraduate student at UCI is assigned for purposes of academic advising to the school or program that corresponds to the student's selection of \u00b7major or school. New students are encouraged to arrange appointments with an academic counselor as soon as possible after they have been admitted to plan their academic programs. Jurisdiction over all questions of academic regulations and academic stand\u00ad ing rests with the dean or director of the school or program to which a student is assigned for purposes of academic advising. Thus, all requests to add or drop courses, waive or change graduation or other requirements, and change area of academic concentration must be processed through the office of that dean or director. A student who has not indicated a choice of major or school on the application form (the \"unaffiliated student\") is placed in the General Studies Advising Program and, after an individual interview, is temporarily assigned to an academic unit for advis\u00ad ing purposes. This assignment continues until the student reaches a decision concerning a major, at which time the stu dent completes a petition for a change of major and is trans\u00ad ferred to the corresponding school or program. Each academic unit is responsible for maintaining a system which provides academic advising by faculty members. These systems differ among the academic units. In some, all of the faculty serve-as advisors; in others, only certain members of the faculty are designated as advisors. In each instance, ho~ever, every student will have a faculty advisor. Responsibility for informing students of the identity of their advisors rests with the dean or director of the appropriate academic unit. This is normally done by letter, but students may obtain information by telephone from the office of the appropriate dean or direttor (see separate listing). A student may request a change of advisor through the chief academic advisor or the dean of the unit. A change in area of concentration often involves a change in advisor. This will always be the case when the change of con\u00ad centration is to a different school or program; the new school or program will assign a new advisor and inform the student. In some schools and programs consultation between students and their faculty advisors is mandatory. Students are responsi\u00ad ble for knowing the governing regulations of the school or pro\u00ad gram to which they are assigned for academic advising purposes. Irrespective of whether or not consultation between student and advisor is required, the student is responsible for initiating and maintaining periodic contact with the assigned faculty advisor. A.n appropriate time for the initial contact is during the week prior to the beginning of the student's first classes at UCI, or earlier at the time of registration if this is possible. Thereafter, consul\u00ad tation between student and advisor at the time of registration for each subsequent quarter is desirable. The actual frequency of these meetings will be determined by the desires of the stu- UC IRVINE - 1981-198220 PLANNING AN UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM dent, the advisor, and the governing regulations. It is the obliga\u00ad tion of the faculty advisor to help the student plan an appropri\u00ad ate program of study and interpret the academic regulations of the campus, but the student is solely responsible for meeting the aca- . demic regulations and remaining in good academic standing. In addition to faculty members, academic counselors are avail\u00ad able in each unit to assist students with major selection, pro\u00ad gram planning, and petitions. Also, peer academic aqvisors (trained upper-division and graduate students) can help stu\u00ad dents plan their programs, select or change majors, and arrange for tutoring as necessary. Besides furnishing counsel on such matters, these advisors dispense general campus information and refer students to the appropriate faculty and staff personnel for assistance with specific problems. In the fall, each new student is required to go to the appropriate academic dean's office prior to the beginning of classes during Academic Advising and Orientation Week for advice concern\u00ad ing class enrollment and to pick up a Class Verification and Identification Card. These plans for new students and provi\u00ad sions for continuing students are explained in detail in the Schedule of Classes. Advising Personnel Biological Sciences Norman M.

Preparation for Graduate ought to keep the possibility of future graduate or professional study in mind as they plan their aca\u00ad demic programs, and they should discuss their career goals with their advisors. Students who have an idea of the direction in which they would like to go should familiarize themselves with the basic requirements for postbaccalaureate study and keep those requirements in mind when selecting courses. Further, students. should supplement their undergraduate programs by anticipating foreign language requirements at major graduate schools and by intensive work in areas outside their major that are of special relevance to their intended graduate work. PLANNING AN UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 21 For information about graduate or professional study in a given field, students may consult the Graduate Advisor or an aca\u00ad demic counselor in the academic unit corresponding to the area of interest. Also, the Career Planning and Placement Center fre\u00ad quently sponsors seminars on specific career areas and offers a number of services useful to those considering graduate or pro\u00ad fessional study. Opportunities for Part-Time Study UCI offers several possibilities to pursue part-time study either for credit leading to an undergraduate or graduate degree or for general knowledge. The same admissions standards that apply to full-time students apply to part-time students. All part-time students pay the full Registration Fee. With approval, a gradu\u00ad ate student may enroll for fewer than 12 units of academic credit; however, the student pays all applicable student fees and nonresident tuition, if applicable (seep. 26). With approval, part-time undergraduate students may pay only one-half the Educational Fee if they are enrolled for under nine units per quarter (seep. 42). Part-time undergraduate stud'!'nts whose official residence is outside the State of California pay one-half the nonresident tuition. As there are certain restrictions on gain\u00ad ing credit for part-time course work, the student interested in part-time study should read applicable sections in the General Catalogue. The following special opportunities for part-time study exist: -Employed graduate students may pursue a Master's degree in Engineering on a part-time basis, with approval of the Dean of the School of Engineering and the Dean of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research (seep. 217). \u00b7 -The Master's degree program in Information and Computer Science is available to students who are unable to study full time because of personal or professional commitments (see p. 193). -The Graduate School of Management offers several courses each quarter during afternoon and evening hours, to accom\u00ad modate the needs of part-time students (see the quarterly Schedule of Classes). -Certain University Extension courses qualify for unit credit toward a degree; however, if the student wishes to enroll in an Extension course concurrently with enrollment in regular UCI courses, the entire course of study must be approved in advance by the dean of the student's school (in the case of graduate students, by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research) (seep. 27, 40, 53). -In addition to course work for part-time students already enrolled at UCI, Irvine offers qualified junior-and senior\u00ad high school students the opportunity to participate in the reduced-fee Early Admission Experimental Program (see p. 35). -Many courses of the regular curriculum are availaqle through University Extension to persons interested in improving their general knowledge. Application should be made to the University Extension Office, Irvine Town Center Building. UC IRVINE - 1981-198222 GRADUATE STUDIES AND RESEARCH Jaime E. Rodriguez Dean Graduate education and research, two major areas of responsi\u00ad bility of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, are vital and integral parts of academic life at UCI. Programs lead\u00ad ing to doctoral or master's degrees, or to education credentials, are offered in over 30 academic and professional areas. Many of UCI's graduate programs and research activities have achieved national reputations for excellence, and several are internation\u00ad ally recognized as leaders in their respective fields. UCI graduate programs continue to grow and to evolve in directions.that are consistent with the University's teaching, research, and public service missions. Graduate study at UCI provides the excite\u00ad ment and satisfaction that spring from the discovery arid dis\u00ad semination of new knowledge, as well as from meeting new challenges. The Dean of Graduate Studies and Research has general admin\u00ad istrative responsibility for research and graduate education. Graduate education responsibilities include admissions, enrolled-student actions and advising degree awards, fellowship and assistantship administration, Teaching Assistant training, and the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program, which facilitates the involvement of minority students and women in graduate education. In the area of research, the Graduate Dean has responsibility for the administration of extramurally funded training grants, general research administration, and research policy development and implementation. The Graduate Division also is administratively responsible for Organized Research Units, Focused Research Programs, the Office of Contracts and Grants Administration, and other cam\u00ad pus research activities. The following sections describe areas of graduate education and research, and include information about academic regulations and policies important to applicants and graduate students. GRADUATE EDUCATION With the exception of programs conducted by the College of Medicine for the training of medical professionals, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research administers graduate education, in accordance with academic policies established by the Aca\u00ad demic Senate and by the Graduate Council, a standing commit\u00ad tee of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. There is no separate graduate faculty at UCI; graduate work is supervised by academic units and faculties which have concurrent responsibil\u00ad ity for undergraduate studies. A great deal of information about graduate education at UCI is published in the UCI General Catalogue and in the annual Graduate Study announcement. The staff of the Division Office is ready to help answer your questions\u00b7about admission, aca\u00ad demic policies arid procedures, graduate programs and degrees, financial assistance, student services, and other matters of con\u00ad cern to applicants or graduate students. Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program (GPOP), positive steps are being taken to increase the participa\u00ad tion of minorities and women in certain fields, in the graduate academic and professional programs of the University. Appro\u00ad priate assistance is offered during the admission process, and every effort is made through GPOP advising and support to ensure that all students will have a reasonable chance to attain their academic objectives. UCI does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, or marital status. Admission to Graduate Standing Applicants for admission to graduate study at UCI must con\u00ad currently apply for acceptance into a specific graduate program to work toward an advanced degree or California education credential. A general requirement for admission is that the applicant hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Letters, Philos\u00ad ophy, or Science (or an acceptable equivalent) from a recog\u00ad nized academic institution. A grade average of at least B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) or better normally is required. Applicants for pro\u00ad grams leading to M.A., M.S., or Ph.D. degrees must submit scores from the Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test; the. Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) is pre\u00ad ferred by the Graduate School of Management. Most graduate programs have additional admission requirements. Each applicant's file is evaluated by the admissions committee of the specific graduate program and by the Graduate Dean on the basis of such factors as academic subject preparation, scho\u00ad larship, letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examina\u00ad tion scores, and exampl~s of previous work. A critical question is whether the applicant's academic objectives can reasonably be satisfied by the graduate programs on this campus. The Univer\u00ad sity of California does not have the capacity to accommodate all applicants who meet the minimum admission requirements. Prospective graduate students are encouraged to assess the pro\u00ad fessional placement opportunities that are anticipated in the field of interest. It is generally recognized that the number of traditional academic appointments in certain disciplines is limited. There are, however, other attractive career options, many of them as yet unrecognized, for highly motivated men and women who demonstrate intellectual strength, integrity, and discipline in earning an advanced degree from a respected uni\u00ad versity. UCI is committed to helping graduate students develop, in addition to their academic training, the communication and problem-solving skills that also may be critical to future careers. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982UC IRVINE - 1981-198224 GRADUATE STUDIES AND RESEARCH How to Apply Application forms and the annual Graduate Study announcement giving application deadlines for each program are available from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. For fall_ quarter admission, application by February 1 is required by some pro\u00ad grams and strongly encouraged for all others. Some academic units will accept applications for winter' or spring quarter admission, for which the deadlines are October 15 and January 15, respectively. Two complete sets of official records covering all postsecondary academic work attempted, regardless of length of attendance, are required. A summary of credit transferred and recorded on the transcript issued by the institution granting the degree will not suffice, except in the case of graduates of the University of California. Records must include official evidence of all college-level degrees conferred. To be official, record copies must bear the Registrar's signature and the seal of the issuing institution, and should be sent directly from the Regis\u00ad trar to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. Univer\u00ad sity of California transcripts also must be requested by appli\u00ad cants, including those who are UCI undergraduates. Until a complete official academic record including certification of degrees awarded has been received, final admission and registra\u00ad tion will not be granted. One set of transcripts and all other credentials is retained by the Division, and may not be with\u00ad drawn by applicants or students for any purpose. The second set is forwarded to the appropriate academic unit, retained there, and may be used by the student in conferring with faculty advisors. Three letters of recommendation are required. Letters from professors or instructors in disciplines related to the pro\u00ad posed course of study are preferred. The application must be accompanied by a nonrefundable $25 Application Fee in the form of a check, draft, or money order for the exact amount made payable to Regents-UC. In order for the applicant to receive full consideration, it is necessary that letters and official transcripts be received before the published deadlines. Where stU:dents have work in progress at the dead\u00ad line dates, final transcripts covering such work must be received before a provisionally admitted student is officially enrolled. A formal notice of the admission decision is sent to each appli\u00ad cant by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research as soon as possible after the application and complete records are received, and after the department has made a recommendation. All applicants are advised to await this official notification of admission before making definite plans or arrangements for attending UCI. Admission of Foreign Students Foreign applicants are subject to the standard admission require\u00ad ments and must provide satisfactory evidence of financial sup\u00ad port in order to obtain necessary visa documents. Since it nor\u00ad mally takes much longer to obtain credentials and process for\u00ad eign applications, foreign students are urged to apply at least six \u00b7months prior to the deadline dates. All foreign applicants, except those from countries where Eng\u00ad lish is the primary language, must take the TOEFL Examination (Test of English as a Foreign Language). Ordinarily a score of 550 or better is required. Upon admission and prior to the first day of instruction, the spoken and written English communica\u00ad tion skills of a student who has not attained a TOEFL score of at least 600 or who is being considered for appointment as a teaching assistant or reader will be evaluated. The primary pur\u00ad pose of this policy is to identify potential communication prob\u00ad lems and to recommend an appropriate program for the devel\u00ad opment of language skills. Limited Status ~nder certain conditions, students holding a bachelor's degree are admitted to Limited Status in order to prepare for admis\u00ad sion to a graduate or professional program by enrolling for a prescribed set of courses (usually undergraduate courses), or to pursue a specific academic program which does not lead to a recognized degree. Although Limited Status does not represent graduate standing, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research may offer admission upon the recommendation of an academic unit which has agreed to oversee the student's program. Limited Status students may enroll in graduate courses with the permis\u00ad sion of the instructor, but courses taken while in Limited Status will not satisfy degree or residency requirements for any UC graduate program to which the student eventually might be admitted. Admission to Limited Status does not imply admis\u00ad sion to Graduate study at some later date. Academic Advising In each academic unit with an advanced degree program, there is at least one formally appointed Graduate Advisor or Director of Graduate Studies. The Graduate Advisor is a regular faculty member responsible for supervising graduate study in that unit, for monitoring the academic progress of graduate students, and for seeing that each graduate student is assigned a faculty ad\u00ad visor. The Graduate Advisor plays a key role in the academiC lives of graduate students, advising students and other faculty members about program requirements and the academic poli\u00ad cies of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, approv\u00ad ing study lists, and evaluating academic petitions. In many aca\u00ad demic units the Graduate Advisor is instrumental in the selec\u00ad tion of students for assistantship and fellowship appointments, and in the supervision of graduate student teachers. In most schools there also is an Associate Dean for Graduate Studies who coordinates many of the functions which affect graduate students within that school. Both Graduate Advisors and Deans are important links between the student and the Dean of Grad- uate Studies and Research. . Most graduate students also will have an individual faculty ad\u00ad visor or advising committee, especially after the first year of advanced study. When a student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., the doctoral committee becomes the primary source of academic guidance; however, student academic petitions still must be approved by the Graduate Advisor. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Academic Policies The academic policies described in this section of the Catalogue apply to students enrolled in graduate study. Other regulations and procedures of importance to graduate students are covered in the Academic Regulations and Enrollment and Other Proce\u00ad dures sections, and in the description of each graduate program. Scholastic Requirements A graduate student is expected to make satisfactory progress toward an approved academic objective, as defined by the faculty of the program in accordance with policies of the Grad\u00ad uate Council, and to maintain a satisfactory grade point average for all work undertaken while enrolled in graduate study. Satis\u00ad factory progress is determined on the basis of both the recent academic record and overall performance. A graduate student normally is expected to complete satisfactorily at least eight units of academic credit applicable to the graduate program in each regular academic session (unless on an approved Leave of Absence), and satisfy all requirements of the academic program according to an approved schedule. For a graduate student, only the grades A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholar\u00ad ship and may be applied toward advanced degree requirements. However, a UCI course in which a grade of B-is earned may be accepted in partial satisfaction of the degree requirements if the student has a grade point average of at least 3.0 in all courses applicable to the degree. Graduate students may not apply courses graded Pass or Not Pass toward any degree or satisfac\u00ad tory progress requirements. A grade point average below the B level (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is not satisfactory, and a student whose grade point average is below that level is subject to academic disqualification. A student's academic progress ordinarily is evaluated on the basis of the academic record. A few weeks after the end of a quarter, an updated copy of each enrolled student's permanent academic record is available from the Registrar. This record lists all UCI courses for which a graduate student was enrolled (including courses taken through the Intercampus Exchange Program), the grades assigned, and the cumulative grade point average. Formal candidacy for an advanced degree, degrees con\u00ad ferred, certain examinations passed, unit credit accepted from other institutions, and other important academic information is recorded also. A graduate student who has not demonstrated satisfactory pro\u00ad gress is not eligible for any academic appointment, such as Reader, Research Assistant, or Teaching Assistant, and may not hold a fellowship or other award which is based upon academic merit. Grading With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research courses at the graduate level may be graded Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory (S/U). Certain graduate courses are graded S/U only, with the approval of the Graduate Coun\u00ad cil. A grade of S is equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit is given for a course in which a grade of U was assigned. GRADUATE STUDIES AND RESEARCH 25 Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program; may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree; and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. The grade of Incomplete (I) may be assigned by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality, but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control. Although Incomplete grades do not affect a graduate student's grade point average, they are an important factor in evaluating academic progress. The maximum amount of time that an instructor may allow for making up incomplete work is three quarters of enrollment, but stricter limits may be applied. When work is completed within the time allowed, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade notice to the Registrar, ordinarily through the dean of the school in which the course was offered. If not made up within the time allowed, an I grade is recorded permanently. IP (In Progress) is a transcript notation restricted to sequential courses extending over two or more quarters, for which use of the IP notation has been approved. When the last quarter of the sequence is completed, the grade for the final quarter is assigned for all quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the stu\u00ad dent has completed the entire sequence. A student who received an NR (No Report) transcript notation must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. After one quarter, an NR becomes an F which will remain permanently upon the stu\u00ad dent's record. A graduate student may repeat once a course in which a grade below B ( 3.0) or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade is used in computing the student's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; there\u00ad after both the earlier and the later grades are used. Additional information about grading may be found in the Academic Regulations section. Academic Disqualification After consultation with the student's academic unit, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research may disqualify a student who has a grade point average in graduate and upper-division courses below 3.0 for two or more successive quarters; or fails to pass (or does not take) a required examination within the time speci\u00ad fied for that graduate program; or does not maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an approved program of study. Unsatisfactory academic progress may be determined on the basis of explicit requirements, but the professional judgment of th~ faculty upon review of all graduate work undertaken by the student is paramount. Ordinarily, a student whose work does not meet academic standards will be given written notice and a reasonable period of time in which to make up all deficiencies. UC IRVINE - 1981-198226 GRADUATE STUDIES AND RESEARCH Prior to taking final action to disqualify, the Graduate Dean ordinarily will notify a student who is subject to academic dis\u00ad qualification and will provide reasonable opportunity for the student to correct erroneous or outdated academic records, to submit other information or comments in writing, or to request a second review of his or her academic performance. Upon written notice of academic disqualification by the Gradu\u00ad ate Dean, disqualification will be noted on the formal academic record of that student. Following the formal notice of disquali\u00ad fication, the student may appeal to the Graduate Dean only on the basis of procedural error. Academic Residence A graduate student is considered to be in residence during an academic quarter if at least four units of academic credit are earned in regular upper-division or graduate courses. Credit for one academic quarter of residence may be earne-d by completing at least two units of credit in approved courses in each of two Summer Sessions. In the case of Ph.D. students, these must be consecutive sessions. Enrollment Limitations Full-time academic enrollment ordinarily is expected of gradu\u00ad ate students at the University of California. Full-time study is defined as enrollment in at least 12 units of upper-division or graduate academic credit per quarter, including credit for super\u00ad vised research or teaching. Graduate students may enroll in lower-division courses with the approval of their academic ad\u00ad visors, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program. Graduate students ordinarily may not receive credit for more than 12 units per quarter in graduate courses, or 16 units in upper-division courses, or a proportionate number in combina\u00ad tion. Course loads in excess of 16 units must be approved in advance by both the student's Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. With the approval of the academic unit and the Graduate Dean, a graduate student may enroll for fewer than 12 units of aca\u00ad demic credit. However, payment of all regular student fees is required regardless of the number of units of credit earned. To be eligible for an appointment as a Research Assistant, Teaching Assistant, or Reader, and for most fellowships, a student must enroll full time. Satisfactory progress toward completion of the academic program is required of all students. Continuous Registration A graduate student is expected to enroll for each regular aca\u00ad demic session (fall, winter, and spring quarters) until all requirements for an advanced degree or credential have been completed, including final examinations and the submission of an approved thesis or dissertation. Enrollment is not official until all required fees have been paid, and the student's Enroll\u00ad ment in Classes Petition is completed correctly, signed where necessary, and submitted to the Registrar. Students are respon\u00ad sible for ensuring that their course enrollment is correct. For more information, see the Enrollment and Other Procedures section. A student engaged in study or research outside the State of California for an entire quarter ordinarily will register in absen\u00ad tia. Unless an official Leave of Absence (see below) has been granted, or. a petition to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration has been approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, a student who does not register by the final deadlines for any/;egular quarter will lose graduate standing, and candi\u00ad dacy for any advanced degree will lapse. Prior to resuming graduate study in the University, a former student must success\u00ad fully apply for readmission. A readmitted student must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree. A degree cannot be conferred earlier than the second quarter following readmission. A graduate student who decides to leave the University after enrolling and paying fees for a quarter must file an official Notice of Withdrawal or Cancellation with the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research. A graduate stude~t in good academic standing who withdraws from graduate study and intends to return within one year may submit an application for a Leave of Absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave pe~iod. Leave of Absence A graduate student who withdraws from the University with the intention of returning within one year and wishes to avoid-a lapse of student status should request a Leave of Absence. A Leave of Absence of up to one year's duration may be granted by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon the recommendation of the student's academic unit, subject to the following guidelines: 1. The student must have completed satisfactorily at least one quarter in residence and be in good academic standing. The leave must be consistent with the student's academic objectives. 2. Leave ordinarily is approved In cases of serious illness or other temporary disability, or temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate reasons. 3. A student on leave is not eligible for assistance from a Uni\u00ad versity fellowship, research grant, or financial aid program, and may not hold an academic appointment or comparable Univer\u00ad sity employment. During a period of leave, a student may not take comprehensive or qualifying examinations or earn aca\u00ad demic credit (except by a transfer of credit from another institu\u00ad tion approved in advance by the Graduate Dean). Leave may not be granted to students who intend to make use of most University resources or facilities (including housing), and it may be revoked if they do so. 4. A student failing to register for the next regular academic session following the expiration of leave will lose graduate standing and will be subject to readmission policy described below. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Readmission A student who previously withdrew from the University, or whose student status has lapsed, may request readmission to graduate study by submitting an Application for Readmission with a nonrefundable $25 fee. The Dean of Graduate Studies and Research may grant readmission, when recommended by the academic unit. If readmitted, a student's previous academic work will be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with .the approval of the Graduate Advisor a~d the Graduate Dean. A readmitted student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission and may be required to satisfy certain requirements a second time, including those for formal advancement to candidacy. A readmitted stu\u00ad dent must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candi\u00ad dacy at least one quarter befere receiving an advanced degree, which will be conferred no earlier than the second quarter fol\u00ad lowing readmission. Intercampus Exchange Program A graduate student in good standing who wishes to take advan\u00ad tage of educational opportunities available only at another cam\u00ad pus of the University of California may do so through the Intercampus Exchange Program. Ordinarily, an exchange stu\u00ad dent will have demonstrated a high level of scholarship during at least one year of graduate study at the home campus, and will have well-defined academic objectives. Approval of the faculty advisor, the host department(s), and the Deans of the respective Graduate Divisions is required. Direct arrangements between faculty members on the two campuses are encouraged so as to ensure the courses, seminars, or facilities will be available to meet the student's needs. Students may take courses on more than one campus of the University in the same academic session. The exchange student enrolls and pays fees on the home cam\u00ad pus, and then enrolls at the host campus, following the proce\u00ad dures of that Registrar's Office. A report of academic work completed will be transferred to the student's academic record on the home campus. Although eligible for all normal student services, the exchange student is a visitor, not formally admitted to graduate study at the host campus. Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program may be obtained from the Graduate Division Office of the student's home campus, and should be filed with the Office at least four weeks before the beginning of the quarter in order to avoid penalties for late fil\u00ad ing of the study list. GRADUATE STUDIES AND RESEARCH 27 Transfers of Credit At least one-half of the course requirement for a master's degree must be completed while in residence as a graduate student at UCI. Credit for up to one-fifth of the minimum number of units required for a master's degree may be allowed for graduate-level work completed at another institution or through University Extension prior to first graduate enrollment at UCI. Such courses do not count toward the required number of units in 200-series courses. Up to one-half the units required may be accepted from another Graduate Division of the University of California. After enrollment, the student must initiate a formal petition for such credit. The acceptance of unit credit earned in another program must be recommended by the academic unit to which the student has been admitted and be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. No units of transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B (3.0) or equivalent was assigned. Under no cin;:umstances will grade credit be transferred. A student currently enrolled in a master's degree program or on a Leave of Absence may receive unit credit (not grade credit) for graduate-level work completed at another institution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of the Gradu\u00ad ate Division. No transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B or equivalent was assigned. A student who begins graduate study at UCI in the fall quarter will receive appropriate credit for courses taken in preceding UCI Summer Sessions, provided that the formal date of admis\u00ad sion precedes Summer Session enrollment. Continuing graduate students will receive credit for courses taken in intervening UCI Summer Sessions. Graduate Degrees Master's Degrees The master's degree is conferred at the end of the academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council. The student must be advanced to candidacy for the degree prior to the beginning of the final quarter of enrollment. Therefore, an application for advancement to candidacy, initiated by the student and approved by the academic unit, should be' submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research at least 30 days before the opening of the quarter in which the degree is expected. The Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.) degree normally is attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis; or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. Both require a minimum of one year in residence, satisfactory completion of prescribed course work, and an appropriate demonstration of achievement. Plan I includes a minimum of seven courses (28 units), 20 units or more of which must be at the graduate level; a thesis; and a general examination. Plan II requires at least nine courses ( 36 units), including 24 units or more at the graduate level, and a comprehensive examination covering a broad range of subject matter in. the discipline. Only approved 200-series courses completed while in residence at the University satisfy the min\u00ad imum graduate course requirement. Some programs will have course requirements exceeding the minimums cited above, and may have additional or alternative degree requirements. Please refer to the description of the specific program for more information. UC IRVINE - 1981-198228 GRADUATI: STIJDIES AND RESEARCH Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degrees are awarded by the School of Fine Arts (M.F.A. in Fine Arts) and by the Program in Writing (M.F.A. in English) upon successful completion of the equivalent of two years or more of full-time study with an emphasis upon cre-ative expression and professional develop\u00ad ment. Special thesis or comprehensive examination require\u00ad ments are established for these programs. Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) degrees are awarded upon successful completion of programs designed for the professional development of secondary school teachers and college instruc\u00ad tors. A minimum of one year in residence is required, usually including Summer Session course work. A thesis project or other comparable evidence of professional attainment is part of each M.A.T. program. Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is awarded on the basis of evidence that the recipient possesses knowledge of a broad field of learning and expert mastery of a particular area of concentration within it. The research dissertation is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intellectual synthesis, imaginative creativity, and skill in written communication. The candidate for the Ph.D. is expected to be in full-time resi\u00ad dence for at least six regular academic quarters. Four to six years of full-time academic work beyond the bachelor's degree typically is required to complete the degree. At the end of the first year or so of full-time study, many programs administer a preliminary examination on the student's mastery of fundamen\u00ad tal knowledge in the discipline. Upon successfully demonstrat\u00ad ing a high level of scholarship on this examination and after further study, the student will continue to a series of qualifying examinations which lead to formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. Graduate students ordinarily attain candidacy status for the Ph.D. degree when all preparatory work has been completed, when qualifying examinations have been passed, and when they are ready for the dissertation phase. Students are recommended for advancement to candidacy by unanimous vote of the candi\u00ad dacy committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council. The proposed candidacy committee must be submitted to the Division Office (on the Ph.D. Form I) at least two weeks before the final quali\u00ad fying examination is to be given, so that the formal appointment can be made before the examination date. The Report on Quali\u00ad fying Examination for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Form II) must be signed by the committee at the time the can\u00ad didacy examination is concluded and submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Following a unanimous favor\u00ad able vote of the committee, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon payment of the $25 Candidacy Fee. Candidacy for the Ph.D. will lapse automatically if the student loses gradu\u00ad ate standing by academic disqualification or failure to comply with the University policy on continuous registration. A read\u00ad mitted student who was a candidate for the Ph.D. must again advance to candidacy and thereafter enroll as a candidate for at least one academic quarter before the Ph.D. may be conferred. Following advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., a doctoral committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research (on behalf of the Graduate Council) supervises the student's program, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final oralexamination if required. The chair of the doctoral committee is the member of the faculty responsible for provid-. ing primary guidance of the student's dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will be given just prior to completion of the dissertation and while the student is in residence during a regular academic session, and will be open to all members of the academic community. Ph.D. degrees are conferred, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council, as of the last day of the regular academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied. The In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant By action of each academic unit, the Graduate Council, and the Academic Senate Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs, a Normative Time has been established for each Ph.D. program. This is the expected number of 12-month years from first en\u00ad rollment to completion of the Ph.D. for students entering with normal preparation who are able to study without serious inter\u00ad ruptions. The Normative Time established for UCI Ph.D. pro\u00ad grams is five years in all fields except (years in parenthesis): Bio\u00ad logical Sciences (four or five), Comparative Culture (six),. Comparative Literature (six), Engineering (four), French (six), German (six), History (six), Information and Computer Science (four or five), Management (six). A Ph.D. student in good standing will be eligible for a quarterly grant equal to the Educational Fee if: 1. the student is a formal candidate for the Ph.D., as of the first day of the quarter; 2. the student's accrued time since first enrollment is less than the Normative Time for completion of the Ph.D. established for that graduate program (accrued time is equal to elapsed time from first enrollment as a UCI graduate student less ( 1) up to three quarters of approved leave, and (2) any time between completion of a graduate program or formal withdrawal and readmission in a different field of study); 3. the student is not entitled to payment of the Educational Fee from an extramural fellowship, grant, or traineeship; and 4. satisfactory academic progress has been certified by the Graduate Advisor. Additional information about the In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant program and application forms are available from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. Theses and Dissertations Candidates for the Ph.D. and certain master's degrees must conduct an extensive research project and submit a thesis or dissertation in order to fulfill degree requirements. Research expenses are not supported by the University, and the cost of preparing the thesis or dissertation ordinarily range from, $200 to $1,000 but may be considerably more. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Soon after advancement to candidacy, those Ph.D. or master's candidates who are writing a thesis or dissertation should con\u00ad \"sult with the Manuscript Advisor in the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. The Manuscript Advisor has the respon\u00ad sibility of ensuring that the established procedures and stand\u00ad ards of UCI are upheld in the preparation of theses and disser\u00ad tations. After approval by the doctoral or thesis committee appointed for each candidate by the Graduate Council, a copy of the dissertation (two copies of a master's thesis), must be filed with the Manuscript Advisor for placement in the UCI Library. The final copy must meet the University's require\u00ad ments for style, format, and appearance before the degree can be conferred. Dissertations filed later than the end of the sixth week of instruction of an academic quarter ordinarily cannot be reviewed and accepted in time for the degree to be conferred in that quarter. Ordinarily, a graduate student will be registered for the quarter in which the dissertation or thesis is submitted and the degree is to be conferred, and no additional fees are required. If the manuscript is submitted and accepted before the first day of the regular academic quarter in which the degree is to be conferred and the student was registered for the previous regular quarter, additional fees usually are not required. The Filing Fee Under certain circumstances, a student may be eligible to pay a Filing Fee equal to half of the Registration Fee in lieu of regis\u00ad tration, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. In general, all requirements for a degree must have been satisfied prior to the start of the quarter, except for the submission of the final version of the dissertation or thesis, or the completion of a final oral or comprehensive examination. The student who intends to make use of any University resource, to hold any academic appointment or comparable University employment, or to receive any student service for which official registration and payment of regular fees is a requirement is not eligible to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of regis\u00ad tration. A Filing Fee will not be accepted immediately following readmission, and will be accepted immediately following a Leave of Absence only under exceptional circumstances. The date for payment of the Filing Fee without a late service fee is the same as that for the payment of other student fees. If all degree requirements are not completed during the quarter in which the Filing Fee is paid, the student must subsequently reg\u00ad ister and pay all applicable fees. Conferral of Graduate Degrees Prior to the beginning of the quarter in which an advanced degree is to be conferred, the student must have advanced to candidacy for that degree, and should have received formal notice confirming candidacy from the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. The student should consult the departmental Graduate Advisor to determine which degree requirements, if any, have not yet been satisfied. GRADUATI: SlUDIES AND RESEARCH 29 No later than the beginning of the final quarter, the student should file a Graduation and Diploma Information form with the Division of Graduate Studies and Research and verify with the departmental office that the student's name is included on the tentative degree list. If a master's thesis or doctoral disserta\u00ad tion is to be submitted, the Manuscript Advisor should be consulted well in advance about the final format and the dead\u00ad line for submission of the approved manuscript. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is approximately 90 days after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Financial Assistance for Graduate Students The University offers many types of financial assistance to graduate students. These include fellowships, teaching and research assistantships, tuition fellowships for nonresident stu\u00ad dents, grants-in-aid, student loans, and Work-Study. Applicants \u00b7 interested in assistantships or fellowships should so indicate when applying for admission; continuing students should con\u00ad tact their program's Graduate Advisor. Most awards are made in April or May of the preceding academic year. Regents' Fellowships will'be awarded to a number of promising students entering graduate study at UCI leading to the Doctor of Philosophy or Master of Firie Arts degree. Awards include a stipend, all required student fees, and, if applicable, Nonresi\u00ad dent Tuition. Other fellowships are offered, including tuition awards for outstanding scholars who are not residents of Cali\u00ad fornia. In many cases, fellowship stipends may be supplemented by partial assistantship appointments. Entering or continuing graduate students may be awarded research or teaching assistantships for all or part of the aca\u00ad demic year. The types of assistantships, number available, and required duties vary according to the activities of the academic unit. Neither assistantship includes remission of fees or tuition, but a graduate assistant who is not a California resident also may receive a tuition fellowship. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program, a number of fellowships and assistantships are awarded to first\u00ad and second-year graduate students on the basis of need and aca\u00ad demic promise. All fellowship awards and assistantship appointments are made in accordance with the affirmative action policies of the University. Grants for doctoral research and a limited number of disserta\u00ad tion fellowships are awarded ead1 year; additional information is available from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. The Division Office also provides information and assistance to students who wish to apply for fellowships ftom federal agencies, foundations, and other non-University sources. The Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid section contains informa\u00ad tion about assistance based upon financial need that is adminis\u00ad tered by the Financial Aid Office, including grants, loans, and Work-Study awards. A Financial Aid Prospectus is available from the Financial Aid Office. UC IRVINE - 1981-198230 GRADUATE STUDIES AND RESEARCH RESEARCH The University of California is the state's primary research institution. Most scholarly research and creative activities are supported by University funds or by grants and contracts from federal and state agencies, foundations, corporations, and indi\u00ad vidual sponsors. In addition to University funding, over $26 million from extramural sources was awarded to the Uni\u00ad versity of California, Irvine in the 1979-80 fiscal year for basic and applied research and for other scholarly activity. Under the direction of Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, the Office of Contracts and Grants Administration (OCGA) is responsible for the submission of proposals, acceptance of grant and contract awards, and negotiation of all awards for extra\u00ad murally funded research, training, fellowship, and public service programs. The OCGA also provides administrative support for the Human Subjects and Biosafety Committees, and maintains a Resource Center containing the most current information about extramural funding sources for student and faculty research. While most research takes place at the academic unit level, the academic quality of many of UCI's educational programs is enhanced by Organized Research Units and Focused Research Programs that extend beyond unit boundaiies. Organized Research Units An Organized Research Unit (ORU) ordinarily consists of an interdepartmental group of faculty, students, and other re\u00ad searchers engaged in a continuing program of research, sup\u00ad ported by both University and extramural funding. The work of some OR Us is directed toward the solution of complex con\u00ad temporary problems, while others conduct basic research essen\u00ad tial to our understanding of natural or social phenomena, or of humanistic ideas and expressions. Organized Research Units established on the Irvine campus by The Regents of the Univer\u00ad sity are the Developmental Biology Center, the. Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), and the Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO). A Cancer Research Institute was ap\u00ad proved by The Regents in 1980, replacing the Focused Research Program in Oncology. Developmental Biology Center The Developmental Biology Center is an Organized Research Unit that provides a focus within the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences for research in several related areas of developmental biology and genetics. The major goal of the Center is to under\u00ad stand the mechanisms responsible for the control of growth and the generation of spatial patterns of differentiation during development. Experimental techniques from the fields of cell biology, embryology, genetics, neurobiology, and endocrinology are applied to insects, hydra, fish, and amphibians. The work carried out in the Center has potential implications in such areas as the control of growth and regeneration of lost body parts and the cause and prevention of cancer, nervous system anomalies, and birth defects in man. Research in the Center also involves the analysis of insect developmental hormones which may provide new methods to control agricultural pests and dis\u00ad ease vectors. Institute of Transportation Studies The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) was established to foster research, education, and training in the field of transpor\u00ad tation. The Institute has been an Organized Research Unit within the University of California since 194 7, with its main branch located on the Berkeley campus. The Irvine campus branch was established in 1974. Emphasis at Irvine has been on the development of a strong interdisciplinary research capability. Completed and ongoing research projects have involved faculty and students from the Graduate School of Management, the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, the Program in Social Ecology, the College of Medicine, and the Department of Information and Computer Science. Research at Irvine focuses upon transporta\u00ad tion syst~ms planning and evaluation, fiscal and administrative management of public transit systems, labor relations in the transit industry, and energy and environmental issues. Current projects include \"Shared Ride Taxis as Community Transporta\u00ad tion,\" \"Improving Transit Performance,\" \"The Cost ''The Impact of Union-Management Rela\u00ad tions on Productivity and Efficiency in Urban Mass Transit,\" \"Economic Structure, Community Development, and Trans\u00ad portation Systems: An Analysis of Household and \"Analysis ofTrends\u00b7in California Port Devel\u00ad opment.\" A portion of Institute funding is used to sponsor postdoctoral research fellowships and visiting professorships. The Institute maintains an extensive research collection to sup\u00ad port these activities. The 10,000-volume collection includes books, journals, dissertations, and technical reports in the field of urban transportation. A wide range of services is offered including computer-based literature searching. Students and faculty are encouraged to ~eet with the Information Center's trained personnel to discuss research needs and strategies. Public Policy Research Organization The Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO) is an Organ\u00ad ized Research Unit established to foster empirically grounded research into problems of public policy. In pursuing its broad policies studies mission, PPRO has focused its effort since 1973 on information technology and public policy, and more recently has developed research programs concerned with public man\u00ad agement and human cost accounting. As a campuswide research unit, PPRO draws its research exper\u00ad tise from the full faculty and student resources of the Irvine campus. Of the 60 faculty and students currently doing research in PPRO, the majority are from the School of Social Sciences, the Department of Information and Computer Science, the Pro\u00ad gram in Social Ecology, the Graduate School of Management, and the College of Medicine. Among PPRO researchers are experts in law, public administration, economics, public finance, political science, sociology, psychology, planning, and public health. PPRO projects are multidisciplinary by nature. Among the 22 projects currently in progress are studies of the effectiveness of Federal Civil Service reforms; the use of information systems in U.S. and European local governments; the social and mental health impacts of economic change; the use of deadly force by police officers; the incidence of injuries to children in auto acci\u00ad dents; and case studies of the problems and costs faced by new users of computer technology. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982PPRO maintains extensive survey research, data analysis, and data archiving capabilities which support its research efforts and which serve researchers in various UCI academic units. A limited number of graduate assistantships and work-study posi\u00ad tions are available to qualified UCI students who wish to partic\u00ad ipate in PPRO research projects or in the preparation of research proposals. Focused Research Programs Focused Research Programs are established by the Chancellor for the purpose of developing and, for a limited period of time, sustaining interdisciplinary research that could not be carried out through individual effort or within a single academic unit. Because of the developmental nature of these programs, they ordinarily are approved for no more than three years and are supported partly by University funds. If a research program develops successfully, it may continue with extramural and/ or University support. Five groups of faculty, students, and other researchers have bt;en recognized as Focused Research Programs. Chemistry and Physics of Crystal Surfaces Researchers from the Depl).rtments of Chemistry and Physics are investigating the nature of chemical reactions on surfaces, using the scattering of laser light from surfaces a:s the basic experimental\u00b7technique, and exploring fundamental questions in the theory of vibrational motion of surfaces and absorbed atoms. Goethe Symposium Faculty.from the Departments of German, French and Italian, the Program in Comparative Literature, and the School of Fine Arts, along with scholars from the UCLA Department of Ger\u00ad man and the UCSC Department of Literature, will mount a symposium on Goethe on the 150th anniversary of his death ( 1982 ), concentrating on his narrative fiction. Concomitant goals are to foster scholarly research papers on Goethe and to facilitate collaboration among leading younger scholars con\u00ad cerned with Goethe. Human Stress Studies A series of collaborative, theory-based studies addressing key questions about human stress is being conducted by a group from the Program in Social Ecology and the College of Medicine. Perception and Higher Mental Processes Faculty and students from the Schools of Social, Biological, and Physical Sciences and the College of Medicine are investigating the bases of and relationships between perception, language, and higher cognitive functions. Social Network Analysis Substantive research problems in social history, social anthro\u00ad pology, and sociology are being investigated by researchers from the School of Social Sciences and the Department of History. The researchers are concerned with understanding group dynamics based on a network of individual social relationships. In addition, they collaborate in the development and exchange of network methodologies and theoretical frameworks. GRADUATI: SlUDIES AND RESEARCH 31 Educational Technology Center The primary focus of the Educational Technology Center (ETC) is the interactive use of the computer as an aid to learn\u00ad ing in many different areas. Emphasis is on inexpensive, graphic personal computers now available for schools and home. The activities of the project range from fundamental research to the development of learning modules. The Center is particularly interested in developing production capabilities which will lead toward the efficient large-scale production of highly effective computer-based learning modules. Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project Financed through private and federal funds, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) Project has been in operation at the University of California since the summer of 1972. The goals of the project are to create the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, a data bank of Greek literature from its Homeric beginnings to approximately A.D. 600; to conduct literary research using col\u00ad lected texts; and to apply technological innovation to theSe endeavors. The TLG's research activities are multifaceted, com\u00ad bining the traditional concerns and methodologies of philologi\u00ad cal and literary study with the most advanced features of com\u00ad puter technology. Included among the research foci currently pursued by the Project are the identification of ancient Greek literary and documentary materials extant from various literary\u00ad historical periods; the development of procedures pertinent to the conversion of these materials into machine-readable form; the enhancement of automated text-verification routines; and the examination of criteria for data-capture of \"nonstandard\" source materials such as documentary papyri and apparatus cririci. The Project staff are investigating procedures to allow for nationwide access to data-bank resources located at UCI. The TLG data bank currently contains more than 42 million words of Greek text, and is expected to grow to 90 million words in the future. Though a separate administrative entity, the TLG is closely related to the Department of Classics in many respects. Faculty members of the Department are involved to varying degrees in TLG research; Classics graduate students are encouraged to apply for TLG assistantships; UCI's library and research re\u00ad sources in Classics are immeasurably enhanced by the text and reference holdings acquired by the TLG for its own purposes; TLG-related conferences and visits by scholars from North America and Europe afford the Department and its students many contacts with eminent classicists of special competence. The establishment and availability of a data bank of ancient Greek literary and documentary materials has made UCI a major source of research activity in the field of Classics. UC IRVINE - 1981-198232 UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS The Office of Admissions welcomes inquiries on any aspect of becoming eligible for the University of California and on plan\u00ad ning for transfer. Admissions counselors are available in 245 Administration Building, and inquiries may be addressed to the Office of Admissions, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. General information on application filing is available by telephoning (714) 833-6703; for specific questions regarding admission or eligibility, telephone (714) 833-6705. The University's undergraduate admission requirements, which are the same on all campuses, are based on two principles. The best predictor of success in the University is high scholarship in previous work, and the study of certain subjects in high school gives a student good preparation for University work. The information on admission to UCI given below is organized as follows: Categories of Application Admission to Freshman Standing Admission to Advanced Standing Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission to International Students Application Procedures Additional Information Categories of Application An undergraduate applicant is a student who wishes to com\u00ad plete a program of studies leading to a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree. A freshman applicant is a student who has graduated from _ high school or has earned a California Certificate of Proficiency but has not enrolled since then in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions immediately fol\u00ad lowing graduation are excluded. An advanced standing (transfer) applicant is a high school graduate who has been a registered student in a regular or extension session of a college or university other then a summer session immediately following high school graduation. An intercampus transfer applicant is an undergraduate stu\u00ad dent who is currently or was previously registered in a regular session at another campus of the University of California and has not been registered in another collegiate institution. See page 56. A nonresident applicant is a student whose legal permanent residence (as determined by the University) is outside of the State of California. Nonresident applicants are generally required to pay Nonresident Tuition and must also present a higher grade point average than is required of California resi\u00ad dents. Refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements sec\u00ad tion for further information. An applicant .for readmission is a student who was formerly registered and enrolled on the Irvine campus and who has inter\u00ad rupted the completion of consecutive quarters of enrollment. See page 56. A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who because of a change of objective wishes to obtain a second bachelor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. An international applicant is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States. An Early Admission Experimental Program (EAXP) applicant is an accelerated high school student who wishes to register and enroll on a reduced fee basis in UC Irvine courses concurrently with high school courses. Admission to Freshman Standing The University defines a freshman applicant as a student who has graduated from high school or earned a California Certifi\u00ad cate of Proficiency and who has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions are excluded in the determination. Freshman applicants who are not residents of California should refer ahead to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. NOTE: Applicants still of freshman level ana who have com\u00ad pleted more than 12 transferable units since high school gradua\u00ad tion should refer to the section on Admission in Advanced Standing. \u00b7 Advanced standing credit will be granted for an acceptable course from an accredited college or university taken while still in high school if completed after the tenth grade and if reported on a valid transcript issued by the college or community college which conducted the course. Freshmen applicants who have not yet decided on a major should refer to the section on Planning an Undergraduate Program. Requirements To be eligible for admission to the University as a freshman an applicant must meet the Subject, Examination, and Scholarship Requirements described below. Subject (\"A Through F\") Requirement Students must complete certain high school courses with at least a grade of C in each semester of each course in the subject areas listed below. This course sequence is often called \"a through f\" pattern and must appear on a list of courses that high school principals certify meet University requirements. This list is called \"Courses to Meet Requirements for Admission to the University of California\" and can be obtained from school counselors. The Office of Admissions will determine the equiv\u00ad alency of courses for graduates of out-of-state high schools. a. History-1 year One year* of United States history, or one-half year of United States history and one-half year of civics or American government. b. English-4 years Four years of English: composition and/ or literature, university preparatory in nature. Not more than one year course will be accepted from the ninth grade. *A year course in high school is equivalent to one credit/unit. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS 33 UC IRVINE - 1981-198234 UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS c. Mathernatics-2 years Two years of mathematics: algebra, geometry, trigonometry, cal\u00ad culus, elementary functions, and mathematical analysis. Courses such as arithmetic and business mathematics are not accepted. d. Laboratory-! year A year course in one laboratory science, taken in the tenth, eleventh, or rwelfth grade. e. Foreign Language-2 years Two years of one foreign language. Any foreign language with a written literature may be used. f. Advanced Course-1 or 2 years This requirement must be satisfied by one of the following: 1. Mathematics A total of one year of advanced mathematics: intermediate algebra, trigonometry, or other comparable mathematics courses; or, 2. Foreign Language Either an additional year in the same language used for \"e\" above or two years of a second foreign language; or, 3. Science A year course in any laboratory science completed in addi\u00ad tion to the laboratory science used for \"d\" above. The subject requirement can be fulfilled with 11 or 12 high school units. Grades in these courses are the only grades used in calculating the grade point average. However, the University requires all applicants (except those with a Certificate of Profi\u00ad ciency-seep. 39) to complete at least 16 units. Thus, 4-5 units can be taken in elective courses, which provide an excel\u00ad lent opportunity to strengthen preparation for the University. Additional courses in mathematics and science are essential in the preparation for majors in engineering, mathematics, the sciences, and many other fields of study. Examination Requirement All freshman applicants must submit test scores as described below. Applicants for admission to the fall quarter should take the tests by December or January of the senior year, if possible. The following tests are required: 1. One Aptitude Test -Either: A. The Scholastic Aptitude Test-SAT-(the verbal and mathematics scores submitted from this test must be from the same sitting}; or B. The American College Test -ACT -composite score. 2. Three College Board Achievement Tests, which must include (a) English Composition, (b) one from among the social studies or foreign languages, and (c) mathematics (Ievell or 2). Admission\u00b7 by Examination Alone A student can qualify as a freshman by examination alofle. The required total score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test is 1,100. (If ACT is presented, the minimum score is 26.) Also, the stu- dent's total score on the three College Board Achievement Tests must be 1,650 or higher, or at least 1, 730 if a nonresident of California, with no score less than 500 on any individual Achievement Test. If test scores are available to UCI at a time earlier than the evaluation of an applicant's subject and scholar- ship requirements, and if they meet the above totals, the cam- pus may be able to expedite notification of admission. This option does not apply to students who will have completed more than 12 transferable units prior to admission. The College Board Achievement Tests cannot be taken in academic subjects covered by transferable college courses a student may have taken.

Scholarship Requirement Students who attain a grade point average of 3.30 in \"a-f\" courses taken after the ninth grade will be eligible to enter the University regardless of their scores on standardized tests. Stu\u00ad dents with grade point averages below 3.30 but greater than 2. 77 will be admitted to the University if they achieve specified scores on the standardized test. (See the Eligibility Index.) UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Grades received in courses taken in the ninth grade or earlier are not used in determining the scholarship average, although subject requirements (except laboratory science) may be satisfied with grades of C or better in these courses. If students success\u00ad fully complete more than the minimum units within each required subject, only the best grades are used in calculating their grade point average. Grades are counted on a semester basis unless a school gives only year grades. Students may repeat up to a total of two semester courses (or one year course) in which they receive a grade of D or lower in order to meet the subject and scholarship requirements. The grades earned in repeated courses, however, will not be counted higher than C in determining the scholarship average. If the courses students repeat were taken before the tenth grade, they will be treated as if the students were taking them for the first time. Admission to the Early Admission Experimental Program (EAXP) The opportunity to enroll in University classes concurrent with the junior or senior year of high school is available to certain accelerated students. Through the Early Admission Experimen\u00ad tal Program (EAXP), qualified high school students may enroll in UC Irvine courses, receive grades based on the same stand\u00ad ards as full-time students, and receive full University of Cali\u00ad fornia credit for their work. EAXP is designed to provide the high school student with an enriched education at a substantially advanced level. Students are given the opportunity to take courses of interest beyond those which their high schools offer. Along with the academic advantages, students have a chance to experience an early orien\u00ad tation to University life. To continue at UC Irvine after high school graduation, an EAXP student need only complete a change of major petition and enroll as a full-time student. Also, EAXP status entitles students to Intercampus Transfer (ICT) privileges should they decide to attend another campus of the University of California after high school graduation. High school students wishing more information about the Program should contact the Office of Admissions or their high school counselor. Admission in Advanced Standing The University defines an advanced standing (transfer) appli\u00ad cant as a high school graduate who has been a registered student in another college or university or in college-level extension classes other than a summer session immediately following high school graduation. An advanced standing applicant may not dis\u00ad regard the college record and apply for admission as a freshman. Advanced standing applicants who are not residents of Califor\u00ad nia should refer to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS 35 Advanced Standing Admission Requirements The requirements for admission in advanced standing vary according to the high school record. Advanced standing appli\u00ad cants who have a California Certificate of Proficiency must also meet regular University entrance requirements. NOTE: Admis\u00ad sion requirements for freshman applicants were changed for fall 1979 to include a combination of high school grades and exam\u00ad inations. (See the Eligibility Index.) The high school eligibility for advanced standing applicants will be determined by one of the following, depending on the high school graduation date: 1) Students graduating from high school at the end of the 1978-79 academic year are eligible if they meet the Eligibility Index (p. 34 ); 2) Students graduating from high school prior to the 1978-79 academic year are eligible if they have earned a 3.0 grade point average on the required high school subjects and appropriate test scores if fewer than 12 college units have been completed. The transcript submitted from the last college attended must show, as a minimum, that the studei)S was in good standing and had earned a grade point average1 of 2.00 or better. If the grade point average fell below 2.00 at any one college attended, the student may have to meet additional requirements in order to qualify for admission. An advanced standing applicant must also meet one of the fol\u00ad lowing conditions: 1. A student who met the Eligibility Index or whose high school scholarship average in the required subjects was 3.00 or better may be admitted any time after establishing an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better. If a student has completed less than 12 quarter or semester units of transferable college credit since high school graduation, the student must also satisfy the examination requirement for freshmen. 2. A student who met the Eligibility Index or whose high school scholarship average in the required subjects was 3.00 or better but had not studied one or more of the required courses in high school may be admitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better in another college or university; and b. completed, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate college \u00b7 courses in the high school subjects lacked; and c. completed 12 or more quarter or semester transferable units, or met the examination requirement. 3. A student who was not eligible for admission as a freshman because of low scholarship or a combination of low scholarship and a lack of required subjects may be admitted after the stu- dent has: ... 1The grade point average is determined by dividing the total number of acceptable units attempted into the number of grade points earned on those units. A student may repeat courses completed with a grade lower than C up to a maximum of 16 quarter units without penalty. The scholarship standard is expressed by a system of grade points and grade point averages earned in courses accepted by the University for advanced standing credit. Grade points are assigned as follows: for each unit of A, 4 points; B, 3 points; C, 2 points; D, 1 point; I and F, no points; P /NP, no points but are included in the unit total. UC IRVINE - 1981-198236 UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS a. established an overall grade point average of 2.40 or better in another college or university; and b. completed 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of college credit in courses accepted by the University for transfer; and c. completed, with a grade of C or better, appropriate college courses in high school subjects that the student lacked (high school deficiencies equivalent to two one-year courses may be waived) or completed, with a grade of C or better, 1) one col\u00ad lege course in mathematics at least as advanced as the equivalent of two years of high school algebra or one year of algebra and one year of geometry, 2) one course in English of a level transferable to the University of California, and 3) one course in U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign language which is transferable to the University of California. Students considering admission in advanced standing should refer to page 35. Admission for a Second Bachelor's Degree .... Some students may wish to obtain a second bachelor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. Admission as a candidate for a second bachelor's degree requires that the appli\u00ad cant be fully eligible for admission to the University and have strong promise of academic success in the new major. All such admissions are subject to the approval of the dean or director of the UCI school or program in which the second degree will be earned. Students who have not attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should complete an Application for Undergraduate Admission and a Supplementary Information for Second Baccalaureate Applicants form, available from the Office of Admissions. Students who have attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should obtain and complete a Second Baccalaureate Application form through the Registrar's Office. Nonresident Admission Requirements NOTE: Admission requirements for applicants who are not California residents vary slightly from requirements for Califor\u00ad nia residents. Nonresident Freshman Applicant A nonresident freshman applicant must ( 1) graduate from a regionally or state-accredited high school; (2) complete satisfac\u00ad torily the \"a through f\" pattern of subject requirements listed under requirements for California residents; (3) earn a grade point average of at least 3.40 or higher in the required high school subjects (3.00 is equal to a B average); and (4) meet the examination requirement: one Aptitude Test-either the Scho-lastic Aptitude Test (SAT) (verbal and mathematics scores must be from the same sitting) or the American College Test (ACT) composite score-AND three College Board Achievement Tests which must include English Composition; Social Studies or Foreign Language; and Mathematics (level 1 or 2 ). Please note that the Freshman Eligibility Index applies to California resi\u00ad dents only. To be admitted by examination alone, an applicant must score either 1,100 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or 26 on the American College Test. The total score on the three Col\u00ad lege Board Achievement Tests must be 1,730 or higher with a score of at least 500 on each test. Nonresident Advanced Standing Applicant A student who met the admission requirements for freshman admission as a nonresident must have a grade point average of 2.80 or higher in college courses that are accepted by the Uni\u00ad versity for transfer credit. A nonresident applicant who graduated from high school with less than a 3.40 grade point average in the subjects required for freshman admission must have completed at least 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of transferable work with a grade point average of 2.80 or higher. Upon successful completion of that work, two units of the required high school subjects may be waived. A student who lacked any of the required subjects in high school must complete, with a grade of Cor better, appro\u00ad priate college courses in those subjects, or 1) one college course in mathematics at least as advanced as the equivalent of two years of high school algebra or one year of algebra and one year of geometry, 2) one course in English of a level transferable to the University of California, and 3) one course in U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign language which is transferable to the University of California. Exceptions to Nonresident Admission Requirements For admission purposes only, a person residing outside of Califor\u00ad nia may be determined by the Office of Admissions to be a bona fide resident and may be considered under California resi\u00ad dent admission requirements if the applicant: is a spouse of a University of California faculty member; is a spouse of military personnel assigned to California; is a military dependent who has been granted a nonresident fee waiver; is an immigrant who has lived in California for a year and has chosen California as a place of residence; is a minor applicant whose parent or legal guardian appears to be a legal resident of California (as deter\u00ad mined by the University for tuition purposes); has spent any two years or at last term enrolled in a California high school; has spent the last term (in at least 12 transferable units) enrolled in an accredited California college or university; has been physically present in California continuously for at least one year prior to the quarter for which registration is requested; or if one parent has received a degree from the University of California or is a full-time employee of the University of California. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Nonresident Tuition Fee Refer to page 44 for information regarding residence classifica\u00ad tion for tuition purposes and the Nonresident Tuition Fee. Bona fide residents are still held for Nonresident Tuition. Admission of International Students The credentials of an international undergraduate applicant-a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, vis\u00ad itor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States-are evaluated in accordance with the general regulations governing admission. An application, official certifi\u00ad cates, and detailed transcripts of records should be submitted to the Office of Admissions early in the appropriate application fil\u00ad ing period. This will allow time for exchange of necessary cor\u00ad respondence and, if the applicant is admitted, will help the stu\u00ad dent in obtaining the necessary passport visa. International applicants whose native language is other than English will be required to demonstrate their English profi\u00ad ciency. This is most often accomplished by achieving a min\u00ad imum score ofSSO on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The admission of otherwise eligible applicants who do not meet this requirement will be deferred until it is possible for them to demonstrate an adequate level of English ability. Arrangements to take the TOEFL may be made by writing directly to TOEFL, Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 899, Princeton, New Jersy 08540. Students must request the Educa\u00ad tional Testing Service to forward results of their tests to the Office of Admissions. Completion of an acceptable English composition course (as determined by the Office of Admis\u00ad sions) with a grade of Cor better will also clear the English pro\u00ad ficiency requirement for international applicants. Generally, financial assistance and scholarships from the Uni\u00ad versity are not available to the nonimmigrant-visa student. International students must provide proof that sufficient funds will be available to meet their educational commitments while studying in the United States. International undergraduate stu\u00ad dents are considered as nonresidents of California and are required to pay the nonresident tuition in addition to fees paid by legal residents of California. Please direct all inquiries regarding the undergraduate admission of international students to the Office of Admissions. Credit for Native Language Students whose first language is not English may receive credit for course work in their native language and literature, provided such courses were completed on the college level in the coun.try of the vernacular, or on the upper-division or graduate level at . UCI or another accredited English-speaking institution. Application Procedures Application Filing Periods Application packets for undergraduate admission to the Univer\u00ad sity are available from the counseling office of any California high school or community college, or from any University of California Admissions Office. Submit completed application and related materials to the Office of Admissions, 245 Admin-UNDERGRADUAT.E ADMISSIONS 37 istration Building, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, Cali\u00ad fornia 92 717 on or after the appropriate date below: Winter quarter, 1982 Spring quarter, 1982 Fall quarter, 1982 Winter quarter, 1983 Spring quarter, 1983 July 1, 1981 October 1, 1981 November 1, 1981 July 1, 1982 October 1, 1982 The beginning of the application filing period is the same for all campuses. Each campus will accept for consideration all applica\u00ad tions filed during the first month of the filing period. After the first month the closing deadline will vary from campus to cam\u00ad pus. Students are encouraged to file their applications early in the filing period to be assured consideration for the program and campus of their choice. Once enrollment quotas have been filled, additional applications cannot be accepted and will be directed to another University campus where enrollments are still open, according to preferences shown on the application. Application Fee There is a nonrefundable fee of $25 for filing an application for admission. Checks or money orders should be made payable to Regents-UC and attached to the application form. Duplicate Applications Only one application per quarter for the University of Califor\u00ad nia is permissible, and it entitles qualified students to attend the campus of their choice if there is space available. Fees submitted with duplicate applications will not be refunded. Change of Campus If, after you have applied for admission, your plans change and you prefer to attend a different campus of the University, you should write to the Admissions Office of the campus you prefer to attend. In your letter to the new campus, you should state (1)your intended major, (2) the quarter for which you are ap\u00ad plying, (3) the level for which you are applying (whether fresh\u00ad man or advanced standing), ( 4) the name of the campus to which you originally applied, and (5) the reasons for your change. The new campus will ask the campus of your first choice to transfer your records, provided the new campus still has openings for admission at the time of your letter. Processing a change-of-campus preference takes several weeks. However, your admission priority will be assigned based on the date your request for a change was made. You should be aware that special program commitments (such as the Educational Opportunity Program or UCLA's Academic Advancement Pro\u00ad gram) do not transfer from one campus to another. NOTE: If you requested housing or financial aid information at your first-choice campus, you should inquire of the new cam\u00ad pus housing and financial aid offices whether pertinent records have been transferred and about priorities, deadlines, and avail\u00ad ability of financial aid and housing. Transcripts The Office of Admissions requires complete, accurate, and up\u00ad to-date information about a student's academic program and work in progress in order to process and respond to the appli-. cation in a timely manner. UC IRVINE - 1981-198238 UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS All applicants are responsible for requesting that the high schools from which they graduated and each college attended send official transcripts of work promptly to the UCI Office of . Admissions. If a student is applying for admission as a freshman, a prelimi\u00ad nary transcript showing work through the junior year should be requested from the high school. The transcript should list the courses the student is now taking and those the student plans to take. A final transcript that includes courses and grades for the senior year and a statement of graduation or a California Certif\u00ad icate of Proficiency must also be provided. A transcript from the last college attended is required if any college courses are completed before or at the time of high school graduation. Those applying for admission in advanced standing should have their graduating high school send a transcript immediately to the Office of Admissions which will also need a transcript from each college attended. A preliminary transcript from the present college should list the courses currently in progress and those planned before transfer. Attendance at any other schools or colleges after application to the University has been filed is considered to be part of the record and must be reported to the Offiee of Admissions. The transcript and other documents submitted as part of the application become the property of the University; .they cannot be returned or forwarded in any form to another college or university. Examination Arrangements Students should make arrangements to take the required tests with the Educational Testing Service, 194 7 Center Street, Berkeley, California 94 704, or P.O. Box 592, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 for SAT and Achievement Tests. For the ACT, students should write to the American College Testing Program Registration Unit, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, Iowa 52240. (Test fees should be paid to the Educational Testing Service, or the American College Testing Program, not the University.) Test scores will be regarded as official only if they are reported directly to the Office of Admissions by the Educational Testing Service or by the American College Testing Program. Also, final notification of admission cannot be released until scores have been received by the Office of Admissions. In 1981-82 SAT and Achievement Tests will be offered concur\u00ad rently on the following Saturday mornings: October 10, 1981 (SAT only in California, Florida. New York, and Texas) November 7, 1981 December 5, 1981 January 23, 1982 March 27, 1982 (SAT only) May 1, 1982 June 5, 1982 The 1981-82 ACT Tests will be offered on the following dates: October 17,1981 December 12, 1981 February 26, 1982 April3, 1982 June 12, 1982 Details on testing are available from the Educational Testing Service, the American College Testing Program, and from most high school counseling offices. Notification of Admission Candidates for the fall quarter will be notified whether their applications have been retained for consideration at UCI imme\u00ad diately after they are received. Most candidates who applied early in the filing period will receive notice of their admissibility by April 15. (There are similar notification periods for other quarters.) Delays will occur if required records have not been received by the Office of Admissions. Since each application is considered individually, the length of time before notification is subject to some variation depending upon the unique circum\u00ad stances of each applicant. If offered admission by the University, a student will be asked to sign and return a Statement of Intention to Register, accom\u00ad panied by a nonrefundable fee of $50. This amount will be applied toward payment of University fees, provided the stu\u00ad dent enrolls in the quarter to which the student has been admitted. Admission to UCI is not an assurance of financial aid nor does it guarantee assignment to University housing. Separate applications are required of applicants desiring financial aid or University hous\u00ad ing, and receipt of communications from the Financial Aid or Hous\u00ad ing Office does not imply that eligibility for admission has been established. Reapplication and Deferred Admission Privilege In general, an application for admission is effective only for the quarter for which it is submitted. If a student is not eligible for admission, or if a student is admitted and does not enroll, the student must file a new application with the required fee in order to be admitted to another quarter. The new application will be considered in light of the admission requirements in effect and the space available on the campus. However, qualified applicants for undergraduate admission may request to have their admission deferred until a later quarter. Requests for admission deferment should be addressed to the Director of Admissions. Every consideration will be given to deferments requested for valid reasons, though applicants should be aware that responses to such requests may vary from quarter to quarter or major to major due to changing enroll\u00ad ment conditions. Educational Opportunity Program Applicants who wish to be considered for the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) should refer to page 58 for sup\u00ad plementary application procedures. Additional Information Recommended Subjects Many University programs require or recommend specific prep\u00ad aratory subjects to give students the needed background in their chosen fields of study. The lack of such preparation, par\u00ad ticularly for advanced standing students, may delay graduation from the University. Details about these recommendations can be found in Prerequisites and Recommended Subjects, a University publication sent each year to high school and community col\u00ad lege counselors. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Subject A and American History and Institutions To be eligible for a bachelor's degree from UC Irvine, students must meet a number of requirements, including those of the University of California, the Irvine campus, and the individual school and major. There are two requirements-Subject A (English Composition) and American History and Institutions-which all University of California students must satisfy in order to graduate. For specific information on these requirements and ways to satisfy them before entrance to UCI, refer to page 14. College-Level Courses The University gives unit credit to students for courses they have completed in other accredited colleges or universities. To be accepted for unit credit, the courses must be consistent with those offered by the University. All applicants with questions regarding transfer of credit should contact the Office of Admissions. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Effective fall 1981, the University has discontinued granting credit for both the general and subject examinations of the Col\u00ad lege Level Examination Program. Advanced Placement The Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Board are taken, usually during the senior year, in conjunction with courses taken in high school. Students will receive 10 quarter units of University credit for each examination (except Latin, Physics C, Part 1, 2, and Mathematics AB which earn five quar\u00ad ter units each) in which they earn a score of 5, 4, or 3. A max\u00ad imum of 10 units can be earned for the following: a combina\u00ad tion of Physics B and Physics C; English Language and Compo\u00ad sition and English Composition and Literature if both examina\u00ad tions are presented; in Studio Art a student may submit either a General Portfolio or a Drawing Portfolio, but not both. These credits will apply toward the total required for graduation from the University. Information about specific application of Advanced Placement toward subject credit may be obtained from the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges. High School Proficiency Examination The University of California will accept the California Certifi\u00ad cate of Proficiency, awarded by the State Department of Educa\u00ad tion upon successful completion of the California High School Proficiency Examination, in lieu of the regular high school diploma. However, all other University entrance requirements (subject pattern, grades, tests) must be met. The date of gradua\u00ad tion on University records will be the date of the certificate. Entrance by standardized test scores will remain an option for the student ineligible on the basis of high school record. Physical Examination All new students and those returning after an absence of two or more quarters require physical examinations and health clear\u00ad ances, respectively, before the first day of the quarter. See Stu\u00ad dent Health. PlANNING FOR A lRANSFER TO UCI 39 PLANNING FOR TRANSFER TO UCI The University is committed to serve as fully as possible the educational needs of students who transfer from other Califor\u00ad nia collegiate institutions. The principles covering transferability of unit credit and course credit are explained below and, unless otherwise indicated, are much the same whether transfer is from a two-year or a four-year institution. Information regarding eligi\u00ad bility for transfer may be found in the section on Admission in Advanced Standing, page 35. Unit Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The University of California grants unit credit for courses com\u00ad pleted in other accredited colleges and universities when such courses are consistent with the functions of the University as set forth in the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. Equivalent advanced standing credit from institutions on the semester calendar may be determined at a ratio of one semester unit to one and one-half quarter units. (To graduate from UCI 180 quarter units, equivalent to 45 UCI quarter courses, are needed.) California Community Colleges Students may find it advantageous or necessary to complete the first two years of a University of California undergraduate pro\u00ad gram at one of the California Community Colleges, which are an integral part of the state's system of higher education. High school graduates who cannot be accommodated at their first campus preference may choose to attend a community college and transfer to their preferred University campus at a later time. A student may earn a maximum of 105 quarter units (70 semes\u00ad ter units) toward a University degree in a community college. No further unit credit may be transferred from a community college, although subject, major, or breadth credit for courses taken will still be granted. Students anticipating transfer to UCI are urged to consult with their community college counselors. The community college counselor, with the aid of that college's transferable course list, can advise students about courses which will transfer to the University. Lists for each community college are updated an\u00ad nually and tell which courses will transfer and for how many units. In addition to the community college counselor, staff in the Office of Admissions and Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges keep current copies and can advise students about the transferability of courses. Four-Year Institutions Unit credit is granted for courses consistent with the University of California's functions and which have been completed in col\u00ad leges or universities accredited by the appropriate agencies. While limitations of credit may be imposed in certain subject areas, these are consonant with the curricula for all students in the University of California. No defined maximum number of units which can be earned toward the degree is set for students transferring from four-year institutions. However, see page 14 for UCI graduation requirements, including requirements for units earned in residence at this campus. UC IRVINE - 1981-198240 PLANNING FOR A TRANSFER TO UCI University of California Extension Extension courses prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XR, XSB, and XSD are granted unit credit on the same basis as courses taken in residence at any accredited collegiate institution. Students intending to transfer Extension course cre(#t for a degree at another college or university should verify acceptance of the course with that institution. Resident students of the University of California must obtain the consent of the dean of their school or college prior to enrolling for credit in an Exten\u00ad sion course. Extension courses are not accepted as part of the residence requirements of the University. Grades earned in University Extension are not used in calculating the University grade point average. Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses taken in institutions other than the University of California rest with the Office of Admissions. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the respective faculties. Course Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The policies above refer only to the unit transferability of courses and are uniformly implemented on all campuses of the University. Thus, courses which are determined by the Univer\u00ad sity of California to be transferable are assured only of being granted elective course credit. The application of transfer work to specific course and major requirements is determined by the student's academic dean. The Irvine campus makes every effort to eliminate all barriers to orderly progress from California community colleges into its own programs. To this end, many community colleges have entered into articulation agreements with UCI so that the spe\u00ad cific application of their courses to UCI's University, school, and departmental major requirements may be readily communi\u00ad cated to prospective transfer students. Students are urged to consult community college counselors or the Office of Rela\u00ad tions with Schools and Colleges for specific information on planning a program for transfer. The University of California bulletin Prerequisites and Recom\u00ad mended Subjects should also be consulted for planning the lower\u00ad division course of study for all programs offered on the cam\u00ad puses of the University of California. Requirements Requirements at UCI are in four categories: University of Cali\u00ad fornia, UCI, school, and departmental or major. Courses not specifically applicable to these are considered to be electives. See pages 14-16 for a description of these requirements. University of Califomia Requirements: Subject A and American History and Institutions Among the means of meeting the Subject A requirement is the completion of an acceptable one-quarter (four units) or one\u00ad semester (three units) transfer course in English composition with a grade of Cor better. The American History and Institutions requirement may be met by completing in high school one year of U.S history or one semester of U.S. history and one semester of U.S. government with a grade of at least C, or upon certification by another Cali\u00ad fornia collegiate institution. UCI Breadth Requirement The new UCI breadth requirement applies to new freshmen entering UCI in fall quarter, 1980. Transfer stutlents who sub\u00ad sequent to high school graduation attended a regular term in an accredited college any time prior to fall 1980 have the option of satisfying this requirement through 1) the UCI 6-3-3 distibution (see below), 2) the new UCI breadth requirement, or 3) one of the other options indicated below. The breadth requirement !)lay be satisfied by college-level courses appropriate to UCI offerings and may be met at any time during the undergraduate years, except in the case of the upper-division Writing Requirement. Transfer students should not feel that these must necessarily be completed in the lower division. See page 15 for details on the breadth requirement. Students who transfer from a four-year institution and who have completed the general breadth requirements of that college will be considered to have met the total breadth requirement of UCI. Students who transfer from a community college and who have met the general breadth requirements of any campus of the University of California prior to transfer will also be regarded as having met the breadth requirement. Students who, upon transfer, have not completed whatever breadth requirements may have been in progress for another campus of the University of California may elect to complete at UCI either that program or whatever UCI breadth requirement is applicable to them\u00ad the UCI 6-3-3 distribution or the new UCI breadth requirement. Students who transfer from colleges on the seme~ter calendar and who elect to satisfy the breadth requirement by fulfilling the UCI 6-3-3 distribution may do so by completing four semester courses (minimum 12 semester units) in one school outside the major and two semester courses (minimum six semester units) in each of two other schools outside the major. Students transferring from another institution who first at\u00ad tended college in fall 1980 or thereafter may satisfy the new UCI breadth requirement (p. 15) by completing a year se\u00ad quence (two semesters work, minimum six semester units, or three quarters work, minimum 12 quarter units) in each of the following areas: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences Ill. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, or Computer Science Students transferring to UCI should refer to the following detailed guidelines on how to satisfy the breadth requirement in each area: UC IRVINE - 1981-1982I. Writing. The lower-division writing requirement may be met by a year sequence in English composition. Courses used to meet the lower-division writing requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C-( 1. 7), or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C-. Transfer students may not count any course designed exclusively for the satisfaction of Subject A toward the completion of the lower-division requirement. Any student entering with only one semester or one quarter of English com\u00ad position through which the Subject A Requirement is fulfilled will not have satisfied any part of the Writing Requirement. The upper-division writing requirement normally should be completed at Irvine. II. Natural Sciences. This requirement may be met by a y~ar sequence in one of the following areas: general biology, general chemistry, basic physics, the physical sciences with the excep\u00ad tion of mathematics. These courses may or may not include a laboratory. III. Social and Behavorial Sciences. This requirement may be met by a year of work in any of the following areas: anthropol\u00ad ogy and comparative culture, economics, political science, psy\u00ad chology, sociology, or social ecology. Students on the semester system may elect to take both courses in the same area or one course from each of any two areas; students on the quarter sys\u00ad tem may elect to take three courses in one area, or two courses from one area and a third from another area. History, for the purposes of the breadth requirement, is not considered a Social or Behavioral Science. (See IV, Humanistic Inquiry.) IV. Humanistic Inquiry. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: classics, history, phi\u00ad losophy, humanities, English literature, comparative literature, dramatic literature, art history, history of music, nature and theory of art. Performance courses may not be used in satisfac\u00ad tion of this requirement. V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Computer Science. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: probability and statistics, calculus, logic, linguistics, computer science, or completion of the second year in a foreign language. In satisfying the above requirements, a student may count toward breadth no more than a year of work taken within the discipline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Phi\u00ad losophy may count no more than two semester courses or three quarter courses in Philosophy toward breadth. Transfer students should check with the academic counselor in their prospective major, the Office of Admissions, or the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges about courses that may be used to satisfy the UCI breadth requirement. A complete description of the breadth requirement is on page 15. NOTE FOR PHYSICAL SCIENCES MAJORS: In addition to the courses taken to fulfull the UCI breadth requirement, stu\u00ad dents majoring in the School of Physical Sciences are required to take one additional year sequence from one of the following breadth areas: Social and Behavioral Sciences (Ill), Humanistic Inquiry (IV), or the Foreign Languages or Linguistics section of Category V. For purposes of this requirement, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that a year sequence of a single foreign language at the first level is acceptable. PLANNING FOR A TRANSFER TO UCI 41 NOTE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES MAJORS: By satisfy\u00ad ing the lower-division Writing Requirement (I) and completing a year sequence of courses selected from classics, history, phi\u00ad losophy, humanities, English literature, or comparative litera\u00ad ture toward the Humanistic Inquiry (IV) breadth requirement, students majoring in Biological Sciences can also satisfy the Humanities requirement for their major. The courses and descriptions listed elsewhere in this Catalogue may be used by prospective transfer students as a guide for selecting courses of similar content and purpose in their own institutions. However, it is strongly advised that they consult with their counselors to verify the transferability of such courses and the applicability to the breadth requirement. No student who has taken a course which is accepted for credit by the Office of Admissions and which has been determined by a community college as acceptable toward completion of the breadth requirement shall incur any loss of credit in satisfaction of the requirement. School Requirements Since school requirements occasionally cross school lines (e.g., physical science requirements\u00b7 for all majors in the School of Biological Sciences), courses taken to fulfill a school require\u00ad ment may at the same time be applicable toward the University breadth requirement unless the school designates otherwise. Also, courses taken to fulfill a departmental major requirement may at the same time fulfill a school requirement or, within prescribed limits, the University breadth requirement. Although course equivalencies for the breadth requirement are liberally interpreted for purposes of transfer, courses to be applied toward school and departmental major requirements must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in unit value and in content. By careful selection of courses, it is possible for students to satisfy some or all of the lower-division require\u00ad ments of their intended program or school prior to transfer. \"' Departmental or Major Requirements Courses to be applied toward departmental or major require\u00ad ments must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in con\u00ad tent and purpose than is the case with courses applicable to the breadth requirement (seep. 15 and departmental sections). Pro\u00ad spective transfer students should consult with their counselors as to the applicability of courses toward UCI requirements. Prospective transfer students should address specific inquiries about their programs to the respective schools or departments at UCI. Community colleges wishing to clarify the status of transfer courses should consult with the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges at Irvine or the University of Cali\u00ad fornia campus closest to them. UC IRVINE - 1981-198242 FEES, EXPENSES, AND FINANCIAL AID Estimated Expenses NOTE: Undergraduate and graduate estimated figures are based on three quarters of attendance. Figures for first-year medical students are based on 10 months of attendance and are higher for second-through fourth-year students, who attend for a calendar year. All fees are subject to change without notice. The following is intended only as a guide in computing average expenses. Fee payment dates are announced in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Special Expenditures Special expenditures beyond the cost of books and basic sup\u00ad plies may be associated with certain courses of study. For example, field study assignments may involve transportation expenses; students who take a dance class may be required to wear a certain type of shoe; a student may need a calculator. A student who has special expenses associated with a course should make an appointment to see a financial aid advisor. Fees Under terms of the Alan Pattee Scholarship Act a surviving child of a California resident who died as a result of accident or injury incurred in the performance of active law enforcement or active fire suppression and preventive duties is eligible to apply for waiver of certain fees. Additional information concerning this Act is available from the Registrar's Office. Registration Fee The University Registration Fee is $150 per quarter. The full fee is required of all students regardless of the number of courses taken. This fee, which must be paid at the time of regis\u00ad tration, is a charge to each student for services which benefit the student and which are complementary to, but not a part of, the instructional programs. No part of this fee is remitted to stu\u00ad dents who may not de~ire to make use of all or any of these ser\u00ad vices. Graduate students studying out of the state may be eligi\u00ad ble to pay one-half of the Registration Fee. California Residents Sample Budgets (for three quarters) University Registration Fee Educational Fee Associated Students Fee University Cente-r Fee Books and Supplies' Room and Board Personal Expenses (Meals on Campus, Clothing, Transportation, Recreation) Average Tota] for California Residents Nonresidents. For nonresidents of California, the above costs apply, plus $2,880 Nonresident Tuition. The $50 advance deposit on the Registration Fee (Undergradu\u00ad ate Acceptance of Admission Fee), requir.ed of new undergrad\u00ad uates, is applied to the full fee when the student registers. Con\u00ad tinuing students are required to pay all outstanding fines and other debts, in full, at the time they pay their Registration Fee for an upcoming term. Medical students are required to pay the full Registration Fee for each fall, winter, and spring quarter, and a reduced Registra\u00ad tion Fee for each summer quarter. As of spring 1981, the fee for summer quarter, 1981, is $80. Educational Fee The Educational Fee is $100 per quarter for undergraduate stu\u00ad dents and $120 per quarter for graduate students. Legal resi\u00ad dents of the State of California with demonstrated financial need may defer payment of the Educational Fee by accepting obligation to repay, at a later date, the sum deferred. Students interested in this provision should contact the Financial Aid . Office, 102 Administration Building. Medical students are required to pay the Educational Fee for each quarter in which they enroll, including the summer quarter. Part-Time Status (Undergraduates Only). The Educational Fee has been reduced 50 percent (from $100 to $50 per quar\u00ad ter) for undergraduates enrolled for less than nine units, provid\u00ad ing their reduced enrollment is approved in advance by the appropriate academic dean for the following reasons: financial need, health, or family responsibilities. Part-time status lapses at the end of each academic quarter. A student must, therefore, reapply each quarter that part-time status is desired. Associated Students Fees The Associated Students Fee is $13 per quarter for undergradu\u00ad ates and $9 per quarter for graduate and medical students. The undergraduate student fee is administered by the Associated Students of UCI; the graduate and medical student fees are administered by the Associated Graduate St~dents and the Medical Students Organization, respectively. These funds pro\u00ad vide social activities, lectures, forums, concerts, and other activ\u00ad ities at either a reduced charge, or no charge, to UCI students. The fees are required of all students.

The fee is required of all students regardless of the number of courses taken. The fee is used to pay the debt service on revenue bonds sold to finance the construction costs of the University Center. Payment of Fees Fees for each quarter are due and payable in advance within deadlines published in the Schedule of Classes.

Nonresident undergraduate students enrolled in less than 12 quarter units pay Nonresident Tuition at $80 per unit. Nonresident graduate students pay $960 per quarter or $1,440 per semester regardless of the number of units undertaken. General In order to be classified as a resident for tuition purposes, an adult student must have established his or her residence in Cali\u00ad fornia for more than one year immediately preceding the resi\u00ad dence determination date for the term during which the student -proposes to attend the University and relinquish any prior resi\u00ad dence. An adult student must couple his or her physical pres\u00ad ence within this state for one year with objective evidence that such presence is consistent with the student's intent in making California his or her permanent home and, if these steps are delayed, the one-year durational period will be extended until BOTH presence and intent have been demonstrated for one full year. Indeed, physical presence within the state solely for educa\u00ad tional purposes does not constitute the establishment of Cali\u00ad fornia residence under state law regardless of the length of the student's stay in California. Relevant indicia which can be relied upon to demonstrate one's intent to make California his or her permanent residence include, but are not limited to, the following: registering and voting in California elections; designating California as the stu\u00ad dent's permanent address on all school and employment records, including military records if one is in the military ser\u00ad vice; obtaining a California driver's license or California Identi\u00ad fication Card, if a nondriver; obtaining California vehicle regis\u00ad tration; paying California income taxes as a resident, including income earned outside this state; establishing an abode where one's permanent belongings are kept within California; licensing for professional practice in California; and the absence of these indicia in other states during any period for which residence in California is asserted. Documentary evidence may be required. No single factor is controlling or decisive. All relevent indicia will be considered in the classification determination. The residence of the parent with whom an unmarried minor (under age 18) child maintains his or her place of abode is the residence of the unmarried minor child. When the minor lives with neither parent his or her residence is that of the parent with whom he or she maintained his or her last place of abode, provided the minor may establish his or her residence when both parents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been ap\u00ad pointed. The residence of an unmarried minor who has a parent living cannot be changed by his or her own act, by the appoint\u00ad ment of a legal guardian, or by relinquishment of a parent's right of control. A man or a women establishes his' or her residence. A woman's residence shall not be derivative from that of her husband, or vice versa. Exceptions 1. A student who remains in this state after his or her parent, who was theretofore domiciled in California for at least one year immediately prior to leaving and has, during the student's UC IRVINE - 1981-1982minority and within one year immediately prior to the residence determination date, established residence elsewhere, shall be entitled to resident classification until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident so long as, once enrolled, he or she maintains continuous attendance at an institution. 2. Nonresident students who are minors or 18 years of age and can evidence that they have been totally self-supporting through employment and actually present within California for the entire year immediately prior to the residence determination date and li.ave evidenced the intent to make California their permanent home may be eligible for resident status. 3. A student shall be entitled to resident classification if imme\u00ad diately prior to the residence determination date he or she has lived with and been under the continuous direct care and con\u00ad trol of any adult or adults other than a parent for not less than two years, provided that the adult or adults having such control have been California residents during the year immediately prior to the residence determination date. This exception con\u00ad tinues until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident student, so long as continuous attendance is maintained at an institution. 4. Exemption from payment of the nonresident tuition fee is available to the natural or adopted child, stepchild, or spouse who is a dependent of a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty. Such resident classifica\u00ad tion may be maintained until the student has resided in Califor\u00ad nia the minimum time necessary to become a resident. If a stu\u00ad dent is enrolled in an institution and the member of the military (a) is transferred on military orders to a place outside the state where the member continues to serve in the armed forces of the United States, or (b) is retired as an active member of the armed forces immediately after having been on active duty in California, the student is entitled to retain resident classification under conditions set forth above. 5. A student who is a member of the United States military sta\u00ad tioned in California on active duty, except a member of the mil\u00ad itary assigned for educational purposes to a state-supported institution of higher education, shall be entitled to resident clas- . sification until he or she has resided in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident. 6. A student who is an adult alien is entitled to resident classifi\u00ad cation if the student has been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence in accordance with all applicable provisions of the laws of the United States and has thereafter established and maintained residence in California for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determination date. 7. A student who is a minor alien shall be entitled to resident classification if the student and the parent from whom residence is derived have been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, provided that the parent has had residence in California for more than one year after admission to per\u00ad manent residence prior to the residence determination date for the term. 8. Children of deceased public law enforcement or fire sup\u00ad pression employees, who were California residents and who FEES, EXPENSES, AND ANANCIAL AID 45 were killed in the course of law enforcement or fire suppression duties, may be entitled to resident status. Procedures New and returning students are required to complete a State\u00ad ment of Legal Residence. The student's status is determined by the Residence Deputy who is located in the Registrar's Office. The student is cautioned that this summation is not a complete explanation of the law regarding residence. The student should also note that changes may have been made in the rate of non\u00ad resident tuition and the residence requirements between the time this catalogue statement is published and the relevant resi\u00ad dence determination date. Regulations have been adopted by The Regents, a copy of which is available for inspection in the Registrar's Office of the campus. Nonimmigrant aliens having visa classifications A, E, G, I, or K should consult the Residence Deputy in the Registrar's Office for further information about their ability to become California residents for tuition purposes. All students classified incorrectly as residents are subject to re\u00ad classification and to payment of all nonresident fees not paid. If incorrect classification results from false or concealed facts by the student, the student also is subject to University discipline. Resident students who become nonresidents must immediately notify the Residence Deputy. Inquiries from prospective students regarding residence require\u00ad ments for tuition purposes should be directed to the Residence Deputy. No other University personnel are authorized to supply information relative to residence requirements for tuition pur\u00ad poses. Any student, following a final decision on residence clas\u00ad sification by the Residence Deputy, may make written appeal to the Legal Analyst-Residence Matters (590 University Hall, University of California, 2200 University Avenue, Berkeley, California 94 720) within 120 days after notification of the final decision by the Residence Deputy. Waivers of Nonresident Tuition To the extent funds are available, Nonresident Tuition waivers may be granted to spouses and dependent, unmarried children under age 21 of University faculty members who are qualified for membership in the Academic Senate; to the unmarried, dependent children under age 21 of a full-time University employee whose permanent assignment is outside California and who has been employed by the University for more than one year immediately prior to the opening of the term; and for certain foreign students. Inquiries regarding these waivers nor\u00ad mally should be directed to the Dean of the Graduate Division of the campus the student proposes to attend. In addition, certain student Teaching Assistants and Teaching Fellows, and certain graduate students designated as University Fellows and Distinguished Scholars, may be eligible for Nonres\u00ad ident Tuition Waivers or fellowships. Such students should contact the Graduate Division for further information. Fee Refunds New undergraduates who cancel their registration before the first day of instruction are entitled to a refund of Registration Fee paid except for the $50 nonrefundable Acceptance of Admission Fee; other fees paid are refunded in full. UC IRVINE - 1981-198246 FEES, EXPENSES, AND ANANCIAL AID For all continuing and readmitted students, and new graduate and medical students, there is a service charge of $10 for cancel\u00ad lation of registration or withdrawal before the first day of instruction. The Associated Student Fee and the University Center Fee are refunded only for cancellation of registration prioHo the first day of orientation. After instruction begins, a withdrawal form, available from the Registrar's Office, is necessary. Students who withdraw from the University during the first five weeks of instruction will receive refunds1 of Registration Fee, Educational Fee, and Non\u00ad resident Tuition Fee, less the $50 nonrefundable Undergraduate Acceptance of Admission Fee, on the following basis, effective with the first day of instruction and the effective date of with\u00ad drawal: 1-14 calendar days, 80% of 29-35 calendar days, 20% of amount paid; 36 calendar days and over, 0%. The effective date of withdrawal is normally the date the student's official notice of withdrawal is received by the University. However, under extenuating circum\u00ad stances, the Assistant Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs, the Dean of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, or the College of Medicine Promotion and Honors Committee, as appropriate, may determine that the effective date of withdrawal occurred prior to the filing of the notice. It is presumed that no University services will be provided to the student after that date. Claims for refund of fees must be presented during the fiscal year (July 1 to June 30) in which the claim is applicable. To obtain a refund, the student must surrender the identification card to the Assistant Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs, the Dean of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, or the College of Medicine Director of Admissions and Records at the time of withdrawal. Refund checks are issued by the Account\u00ad ing Office and are generally received by mail about four weeks after the official withdrawal. . If any portion of a student's fees has been paid by the Univer\u00ad sity or outside sources, that portion of the refund will be returned directly to the source of those funds. Students receiv\u00ad ing financial aid will have their monies credited to the appro\u00ad priate accounts. Housing Refund Policies UCI Housing Contracts provide students with complete hous\u00ad ing refund policies. Financial Aid Lack of funds need not be a barrier to attending UCI; almost one third of enrolled students receive some form of financial aid. Students who show that they need financial assistance in order to attend are eligible for financial aid through the Finan\u00ad cial Aid Office. In addition to awarding aid on the basis of financial need, the Office also offers some scholarships based on academic excellence. Graduate Student Loans, at nine percent 1lf no credit\u00b7 for courses is received, a full refund of the Registration Fee of the regular session will be granted to all students entering the armed forces prior to the sixth week of the quarter. No refund thereafter. interest, are available through banks and other lenders regard\u00ad less of financial need. Most graduate fellowship programs are administered by the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. Students who receive financial aid will receive funds from one or more of the following sources: scholarships, grants, loans, and work-study. These sources are described briefly in the fol\u00ad lowing sections; more detailed information can be obtained from the Financial Aid Office. To obtain financial aid, new and continuing students must file the Student Aid Application for California (SAAC) and the necessary supporting documents each year. Students are '- encouraged to apply as early as possible. The SAAC, additional forms, information regarding the application process, and finan\u00ad cial aid programs for undergraduate, graduate, and medical stu\u00ad dents may be found in the Financial Aid Prospectus which is . available in the Financial Aid Office. The usual priority deadline for loans, work-study, and most grants is around April 15. The application deadline for Cal Grants A and B is usually around February 12 for the following academic year. The University expects the student and the parent (or spouse) to contribute toward the educational costs to every extent possible. For dependent students, an analysis of the SAAC and supporting documents determines the amount a student's parents can be expected to contribute toward the cost of the student's educa\u00ad tion. For independent students, the analysis determines the amount a student and/ or spouse can contribute to the cost of the student's education. Income, assets, debts, size of family, and the number of family members in college are the major fac\u00ad tors considered in the analysis. Assets include, but are not limited to, equity in real estate; stocks, bonds, and other securi\u00ad ties; business and farm equity; and cash, savings, and checking accounts. Income includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and nontaxable income such as Social Security benefits. All undergraduate financial aid applicants are also required to apply for a (Pell) Basic Grant and for a Cal Grant A or a Cal Grant B. Scholarships Scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic ability, achievement, and promise. Although a few honorary scholar\u00ad ships are awarded on the basis of academic excellence alone, rnost also require that an applicant demonstrate financial need. To be considered for a scholarship, undergraduate students must file an Undergraduate Scholarship Application, available from the Financial Aid Office. Filing deadlines vary each year, but the usual deadline is early January for the following aca\u00ad demic year. Regents' scholarships, among the highest honors conferred upon UC students, are awarded on the basis of academic excel\u00ad lence and exceptional promise, without reference to financial need. Undergraduate students are eligible upon graduation from high school or upon completion of the sophomore year of col\u00ad lege. Medical students are eligible during any year of their study in medical school. The appointments run for four years for stu\u00ad dents entering from high school or two years for students appointed after their sophomore year. Regents' Scholars receive a $100 honorarium the first year of their appointment. In addi\u00ad tion, a stipend is awarded each year to Regents' Scholars who submit a complete financial aid application and demonstrate financial need. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982University scholarships are offered to students enter-ing their freshman or junior year who show evidence of high scholastic attainment. Students who demonstrate financial need may receive awards ranging up to $1,200 per academic year. These awards are renewable by submitting an application for consider\u00ad ation each year. Other scholarships are available to students who qualify. While a student need not apply for a specific scholarship, applicants with special qualifications will receive careful consideration. For information on Air Force ROTC scholarships, see page 11. For additional information, contact the Scholarship Coordina\u00ad tor in the Financial Aid Office. Grants Grants are awarded on the basis of financial need. There is no repayment requirement. (Pell) Basic Grant: is the largest federally funded grant pro\u00ad gram and provides awards up to a maximum of $1,900 for the academic year. To be eligible, applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents and must be enrolled as undergraduates and have not previously received a bachelor's degree. Students should use the SAAC to apply for this grant. Cal Grant A: is a State-funded scholarship program and cur\u00ad rently provides awards up to $816 for the academic year to cover the cost of fees. To be eligible, applicants must be Cali\u00ad fornia residents and demonstrate financial need. Students should use the SAAC together with the Cal Grant Supplement to apply for Cal Grant A. The filing deadline for new applicants is usually around February 12 for the following year. Cal Grant B: is a State-funded grant program and provides awards up to a maximum of $1,100 during a student's first year and $1,100 plus the cost of fees during subsequent years. To be eligible, applicants must be California residents, demonstrate financial need, and be entering college or not have completed more than one quarter of college work. Students may use the SAAC together with the Cal Grant Supplement to apply for Cal Grant B. The filing deadline for new applicants is usually around February 12 for the following year. Note: Students may not receive both Cal Grant A and Cal Grant B. If offered both, the Financial Aid Office recommends taking Cal Grant B over Cal, Grant A. Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG): provides grant aid for undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. These federal grants range from $200 to $2,000 per year, depending upon financial need. UC Grant-In-Aid (GIA): is funded by the University of Cali\u00ad fornia and provides grant aid for full-time students who demon\u00ad strate financial need. The amount awarded depends upon finan\u00ad cial need. Educational Fee Grant (EFG): is funded by the University of California and provides aid for undergraduates in their first year of attendance at UCI. Recipients must be California residents, enrolled full time, and must demonstrate financial need. The maximum grant at a UC campus is $100 per quarter (to pay the Educational Fee). FEES, EXPENSES, AND ANANCIAL AID 47 Loans National Direct Student Loan (NDSL): provides long-term federal loans for U.S. citizens and permanent residents. The amounts awarded vary, depending on financial need, but cannot exceed $3,000 for the first two years or $6,000 for the under\u00ad graduate years. No interest is charged nor is repayment required while the borrower is enrolled in at least one half of the normal academic load. Interest of four percent a year begins six months after the borrower ceases to be enrolled, or is enrolled less than half time, and repayment must be completed within a 10-year period. Graduate students may receive an aggregate of $12,000 which includes loans received as an undergraduate. Educational Fee Loan (EFL): funded by the University of California, enables California residents who establish financial need to delay payment of all or a portion of the University of California's Educational Fee. Repayment at three percent inter\u00ad est begins nine months after graduation or withdrawal from higher education. University Loan: funded by the University of California, pro\u00ad vides long-term loans to full-time students who demonstrate financial need. The maximum amount for an academic year is $1,000. The three percent interest begins when a student leaves UCI. Repayment begins six months after the student ceases to be enrolled full time and must be completed within five years. Two co-signers are required. California Guaranteed Student Loan Program (GSL): is a federally supported loan available to U.S. citizens or permanent residents through participating local banks or other lenders at an interest rate of nine percent. Dependent undergraduate stu\u00ad dents may borrow up to $2,500 per year ($3,000 for independ\u00ad ent undergraduates) depending on the participating bank. Grad\u00ad uate and medical students may borrow a maximum of $5,000 per year, not to exc~ed a cumulative total of $25,000, including undergraduate loans. Income and assets are not used as criteria in determining eligibility for interest benefits. As a result, most students are eligible. The minimum repayment is $30 per month, including an interest rate of nine percent a year, and begins six months after the borrower ceases to be enrolled at least half time. The entire loan must be repaid in 15 years. Application forms are available at the UCI Financial Aid Office. Health Professions Student Loan: provides long-term federal loans to medical students only. The amount of the loan cannot exceed the sum of all student fees plus $2,500 per academic year, whichever is less. The interest rate is seven percent. Repayment of the principal is not required and interest does not accrue during the time a student is completing professional training, including internships and residencies. The loan may be repaid over a 1 0-year period. Emergency Loans: In addition to the long-term loans, various philanthropic individuals and organizations have provided money to create an emergency student loan fund. These loans, which do not bear interest, are of a short-tern:' nature to cover emergency needs. Work-Study College Work-Study Program: provides part-time employ\u00ad ment for U.S. citizens and permanent residents who are at least half-time students and demonstrate financial need. The maxi- UC IRVINE - 1981-198248 REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES mum amount recipients can earn under this federal program is determined by their financial need. University Work-Study Program: is similar to the College Work-Study Program except that funds are allocated through The Regents of the University of California. Veterans Work-Study Program: is available only to U.S. mil\u00ad itary veterans. Separate applications and detailed information are available from the UCI Veterans Student Services Office. Summer Work-Study Program: may be available to continu\u00ad ing students enrolled in Summer Session and planning to enroll at UCI in the fall quarter. In addition to the SAAC, students must file a separate Summer Work-Study Application. If a stu\u00ad dent does not successfully complete at least six units (four units for graduate students) during the summer, the majority of earn\u00ad ings from the summer award will be used as a resource during the following academic year. Additional Aid for Graduate Students Graduate students should contact the UCI Division of Graduate Studies and Research, 145 Administration Building, (714) 833-6761, for information about application procedures for other forms of aid such as graduate fellowships, traineeships, or teaching and research assistantships. Aid for Medical Students College of Medicine students should contact the Medical school Financial Aid Advisor, E-108 Medical Sciences I, (714) 833-6476, for information about other sources of financial assistance. Aid for International Students Students who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents may be eligible for assistance from a limited number of University programs if they have experienced an unanticipated change in their financial situation (which must be documented). These students must complete at least one year at UCI in order to be considered for assistance. Aid is limited to the expenses for books and fees. Aid for Handicapped Students All forms of student financial aid are available to eligible handi\u00ad capped students. Interested students should follow the regular . financial aid application procedures and should be sure to spec\u00ad ify on the Student Aid Application for California any additional expenses they may incur because of a handicap. Supporting documentation must be provided. Student Employment The Career Planning and Placement Center assists UCI stu\u00ad dents, their spouses, and alumni in obtaining part-or full-time employment during the academic year and summer vacation. It is not necessary to be a financial aid recipient to apply for jobs through the Center. Students with work-study awards may obtain on-campus or off-campus job referrals in the Career Planning and Placement Center. The Center is located in Stu\u00ad dent Services I. REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES ACADEMIC REGULATIONS Except where noted, all information applies to both undergrad\u00ad uate and graduate students. Additional information concerning academic regulations applying only to graduate students is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Grading System A -Excellent ( 4.0 grade points per unit) B -Good (3.0 grade points per unit) C -Average (2.0 grade points per unit) D -Lowest passing grade ( 1.0 grade point per unit) F -Not passing (no grade points) I -Incomplete P -Pass (equal to grade C or better) NP-Not Pass S -Satisfactory (equal to grade B or better; graduate students only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) U -Unsatisfactory (graduate students only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) IP -In Progress (restricted to certain sequential courses, so designated by the Committee on Courses, for which the final quarter grade of a multi-quarter sequence course is assigned to the previous quarter(s) of the sequence) NR-No Report (given when an instructor's final grade course report is not submitted or when the student's name was on the official class roster but the instructor did not report a grade for the student; NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of sub\u00ad sequent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first, unless the instructor at the student's request.clears the record or replaces NR with a grade). Plus suffixes may be attached to the grades B, C, and D; minus suffixes may be attached to the grades A, B, C, and D. Plus grades carry three-tenths grade point more per unit, and minus grades carry three-tenths grade point less per unit than unsuf\u00ad fixed grades. After each quarter, a copy of the student's permanent record is available from the Registrar's Office. On the copy, the student will find grades for all the quarters taken at UCI, a computation of grade point average at the University of California, and a list of the University requirements completed (Subject A, Ameri\u00ad can History and Institutions, etc.). Requirements for a bachelor's degree include the accumulation of credit for 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). A course at UCI normally offers four quarter units of credit, and the term \"course\" may be understood in what follows to carry four units. The grade point average is the sum of all accumulated grade points (grade points earned in a course per unit times the unit value of the course) divided by the sum of all units attempted. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 49 UC IRVINE - 1981-198250 ACADEMIC REGULATIONS It should be noted that final grades as reported by professors at UCI are normally permanent and final. A professoi\u00b7 may not change a final grade except to correct a clerical or procedural error. Clerical or procedural errors should be corrected within one regular academic quarter after the grade is assigned. Under circumstances explained in the Academic Grievance Procedures (Manual of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, Appen\u00ad dix II), a grade may be changed if the Academic Grievance Panel has determined that the grade was assigned on the basis of discrimination. Incomplete Grades An I or Incomplete grade is assigned by an instructor to a stu\u00ad dent when the student's work is of passing quality, but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's con\u00ad trol, and when the student has been excused by the instructor from completing the quarter's work. For currently enrolled students, the maximum time limit for making up an I grade is three quarters of enrollment. After this time the I can no longer be replaced and will appear perman\u00ad ently on the record. The student should consult the instructor to determine how the Incomplete may be made up. The instruc\u00ad tor is not obligated to alla\u00ab the maximum three quarter period . .It is strongly recommended that the student and the instructor pre\u00ad pare a written agreement specifying how the Incomplete can be made up and the deadline for doing so. A form is available for this purpose. Once the work is completed within a time agreed upon by the instructor, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade form to the office of the dean of the school in which the course was offered. The student should not reenroll in the course to make up the Incomplete. Students not currently enrolled at UCI have a maximum of one calendar year in which to replace an Incomplete. However, in exceptional individual cases involving the student's prolonged inability to pursue a course of study, extensions of up to two additional years may be granted by the instructor with the approval of the dean of the unit offering the course; students must petition for such an extension within one calendar year following the assignment of the Incomplete grade. Courses graded I carry no grade points and are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on the student's permanent record. Any I grade will remain indefinitely on the permanent record unless the work is completed and a grade assigned as described above. University of California regulations require a grade point aver\u00ad age of 2.0 for all units attempted in order to receive a bachelor's degree. Only when a check {or satisfaction of graduation require\u00ad ments is made are l's treated as F's. If the student's overall average is at least a 2.0, including the Incomplete grades computed as F's, then the student may graduate. If the Incomplete grades computed as F's decrease the student's average below a 2.0, the student may not graduate until enough I grades have been made up to bring the average up to a 2.0. Pass/Not Pass The Pass/Not Pass option is available at UCI to encourage stu\u00ad dents to enroll in courses outside their major field. Courses graded Pass or Not Pass are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on a student's permanent record. However, if a student receives a Pass in a class, course and unit credit for the class is received, except as provided below. If a Not Pass is received, the student receives no credit for the class. The use of Pass/Not Pass is governed by all of the follow\u00ad ing provisions: 1. A student in good standing may take up to an \u00b7average of four units per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, can\u00ad didates for the bachelor's degree may take a total of 12 more units in courses designated by aqdemic units as Pass/Not Pass Only. 2. A student who earns a grade of C (2.0) or better will have a Pass/Not Pass grade recorded as Pass. If the student earns a grade of C-, D, or F, the grade will be recorded as a Not Pass, and no credit will be received for the course. In both cases, the student's grade will not be computed into the grade point . average. 3. Courses taken under the Pass/Not Pass option may count toward the 180-unit requirement for the bachelor's degree and toward all breadth requirement. But with the exception of courses designated by the academic unit Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the student's.school and major depart\u00ad ment, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program; may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree; and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. 4. Changes to or from the Pass/Not Pass option must be made during the enrollment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of a quarter without the approval of the dean of the student's school. 5. No student on academic probation may enroll in a course on the Pass/Not Pass option. (Physical Education courses are excepted.) Satisfactory IU nsatisfactory Grades (Graduate Students Only) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading, unlike Pass/Not Pass, is not a student option. With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research or other individual graduate work undertaken by a graduate student may be evalu\u00ad ated by means of the grades S or U. Certain graduate courses are graded S/U only. Also, the grades S or U may be assigned provisonally in each but the last quarter of a graduate course extending over more than one quarter. Upon completion of the last quarter, letter grades (A to F) replace such provisional grades. When a grade of S or U has been assigned on a provi\u00ad sional basis and the student does not complete all quarters of the course sequence, the instructor may assign a final letter grade or the grade of I to replace the S or U, or let the grade of S or U stand as a final grade. With the specific approval of the Graduate Council, other graduate courses may be graded on an ~/U basis provided that each student enrolled in such a course receives a grade of S, U, or I (or if an undergraduate student, a grade of P or NP). UC IRVINE - 1981-1982The grade S is defined as equivalent to a grade of B ( 3.0) or bet\u00ad ter. No credit will be allowed for work graded Unsatisfactory. Grades In Progress IP is a transcript notation, restricted to sequential courses which extend over two or more quarters, indicating that the final grade for the individual quarters will not be assigned until the last quarter of the sequence is completed. The grade for the final quarter is then assigned for all of the previous quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. IP notations may be given only for courses designated by the Academic Senate Committee on Courses for use of this notation. IP notations are not included in computa\u00ad tions of ~he student's grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. G.-~d~ Not Reported A student who receives an NR must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. An NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subse\u00ad q~ent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. NR transcript notations are not included in computations of the gr;J.de point aver~ge and do not contribute to the number of q'!arter units completed. 6rade Points e1nd Grade Point Average Grade points are assigned on a four point basis: A, 4 points per unit; B, 3 points per unit; C, 2 points per unit; D, 1 point per unit; F and I, zero points. Plus or minus suffixes modify the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per unit. Each undergraduate course counts orie through eight units, and graduate courses range from one to 12 units each (see depart\u00ad mental course descriptions). Grade point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total value of courses attempted. P, NP, S, U, NR, IP, and I grades are excluded in computing grade point average. Removal of Deficient Grades Undergraduates may repeat courses only when grades of D, F, or NP were received. Degree credit for courses so repeated will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. In computing the grade point average of an undergraduate with repeated courses in which a D, F, or NP was received, only the most recently received grades and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated. In case of further repetitions, the grade point average shall be based on all grades assigned and on total units attempted. A graduate student may repeat only once a course in which a grade below B or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade shall be used in computing the student's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades will be used. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 51 Satisfaction of the Writing Requirement The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division Writing Requirement must be completed with a grade of C-( 1. 7) or better. The following applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C-( 1.7) or better in the lower-division courses: 1. Students who fail to attain a grade of C-( 1. 7) in one or both courses of the Writing 39A-B sequence must repeat the course or courses in question. 2. Students who fail to attain a C-( 1. 7) in Humanities 15 normally should enroll in Writing 39A; students who fail to attain a C-in Humanities 16 should normally enroll in Writing 398. Alternatively, a student who fails to attain a C-in either Humanities 15 or 16 may repeat these courses with the permis\u00ad sion of a faculty advisor or academic counselor. 3. Students who fail to attain a C-( 1. 7) in at least two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course nor\u00ad mally should substitute Writing 398 if they need one quarter of additional work to complete,the requirement, or Writing 39A-B if they need two quarters to complete the requirement. The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. The following applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C (2.0) or better in the upper-division course: Students who fail to attain a grade of C (2.0) in Writing 139 should repeat Writing 139. Students following any other approved upper-division option should enroll in Writing 139 if a C is not attained in the selected course. See page 15 for further information on the Writing Require\u00ad ment portion of the breadth requirement. Credit by Examination An enrolled student may obtain credit for many courses by tak\u00ad ing a special examination administered by a faculty member who normally teaches that course. Detailed procedures for obtaining credit by examination may be obtained from the office of the dean of the school which offers the course. Ap\u00ad proval of any petition for credit by examination must be obtained from the dean of that school before the examination can be administered. After the dean has signed the petition, the student must have it validated by paying a $5 Credit by Exami\u00ad nation Fee at the Cashier's Office. The instructor giving the examination retains the prerogative ( 1) to decide whether the course can be taken by examination, (2) to determine the form such an examination may take, and (3) to stipulate whether the grade will be reported as Pass/Not Pass or as A, B, C, D, or F. A student may take the examination for a particular course only one time. After receiving the grade, the student may accept it or reject it. If the student is not satisfied with the grade received on the examination, the student may choose not to receive credit or a grade. If the student does choose to accept the results of the examination, grades and grade points will be entered on the record in the same manner as those for regular courses of instruction. UC IRVINE - 1981-198252 ACADEMIC REGULATIONS Independent Study: Undergraduates Only Another class option is available primarily to upper-division stu\u00ad dents at UCI. The option, independent study, allows the student to plan with the instructor a course having a clear re.lationship to the student's academic program. The plan for the course will include a reading list, a group of assignments, examinations, papers, or similar evidence of intellectual achievement on which academic credit will be based. A description of the course and of its requirements must be approved by the instructor respon\u00ad sible for it and by the department chair or dean. Independent study credit for undergraduates is normally limited to five units per quarter. Final Examinations Final examinations are obligatory in all undergraduate courses except laboratory and studio courses, or their equivalent, as individually determined by the Committee on Courses. Nor\u00ad mally each such examination shall be conducted in writing and must be completed by all participants by the announced time shown in the Schedule of Classes for the quarter in question. These examinations may not exceed three hours duration. In laboratory and studio courses, the department concerned may at its option require a final examination subject to prior announcement in the Schedule of Classes for the term. Final grade reports from professors are due in the Registrar's Office within 48 hours after the final examination. Undergraduate Scholarship Requirements Class Level Undergraduate students are classified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior students, based on the total number of units acquired, as follows: Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior 0-40.4 40.5- 83.9 84.0-134.9 135.0- 180.0 Course Load Limits An undergraduate may enroll in as few as 12 units or as many as 20 units. To enroll for more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units a student must obtain the signature of the student's dean on the Enrollment in Classes Petition. Any action to add or drop courses after submission of the Enrollment in Classes Peti\u00ad tion which will cause a student to be enrolled in more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units requires approval by the student's dean. This approval is certified by the dean's signature on the Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, as appropriate. Academic Standing To remain in good academic standing a student must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.0 and make progress toward the degree at a satisfactory rate. An undergraduate student normally is subject to academic pro\u00ad bation if at the end of any quarter the grade point average for that quarter, or the cumulative grade point average, is less than 2.0. A student whose grade point average falls below a 1.5 for any quarter, or who after two consecutive quarters on probation has not achieved a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or a satis\u00ad factory rate of progress, is subject to disqualification. Normal Progress Requirement Regular undergraduate students will become subject to proba\u00ad tion or subject to disqualification from further registration in the University if they fail to make normal progress toward the baccalaureate. (A) Normal progress for all regular undergraduate students is defined in the following table, in terms of quarter units com\u00ad pleted at the end of quarters enrolled. Normal Subject to Subject to Quarter Progress Probation Disqualification 1 12-15 Sell 7 2 24-30 16-23 15 3 145-150 142-144 141 11 162-165 160-161 159 12 180 (B) A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed no less than a number of units in the range speci\u00ad fied in the \"Normal Progress\" category under (A) is making normal progress. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed a number of units in the range speci\u00ad fied in the \"Subject to Probation\" category under (A) is subject to being placed on probation by the Faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed no more than a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Disqualification\" category under (A) is subject to disqualifica\u00ad tion by the Faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. (C) Students who have completed two consecutive quarters on academic probation without having achieved at the end of that period at least the normal rate of progress specified under (A) are subject to disqualification. A student .will be allowed to continue on probation only if the record indicates likely achievement of the required scholastic standing within a reasonable time. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982(D) For purposes of calculating \"Normal Progress,\" \"Subject to Probation,\" and \"Subject to Disqualification,\" students admitted to the University with advanced standing will be classi\u00ad fied with respect to quarter of enrollment at entrance in accor\u00ad dance with the following table: Quarter at Entrance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Advanced Standing Quarter Units at earned under the following three circumstances are not to be counted toward determination of the quarter at entrance under (D) above: ( 1) Advanced Placement Examina\u00ad tion; (2) College Level Examination Program; (3) concurrent enrollment in college courses while in high school. (F) The quarter of enrollment at entrance of students ( includ\u00ad ing baccalaureate degree candidates who already hold a bacca\u00ad laureate degree) seeking admission to the University with 150 or more advanced standing units will be determined by the Faculty offering the curriculum in which such students seek to enroll. This determination will be made consistent with the pro\u00ad gram required for such students to obtain the desired degree and with University residence requirements. Probation is not a necessary step before disqualification. If a student becomes subject to disqualification, the complete record of grades and other accomplishments will be carefully reviewed by the responsible faculty authorities of the student's school. If the record indicates little probability that the student will be able to meet the academic standards of the University of California, the student will be disqualified from further enroll\u00ad ment. Each school and program is obliged by Academic Senate regulations to maintain a procedure under which a student may appeal probation and disqualification actions. In order to transfer from one campus to another in the Univer\u00ad sity of California or from one UCI school to another, a student who has been disqualified or who is on academic probation must obtain the approval of the appropriate faculty, or its designated agent, into whose jurisdiction the student seeks to transfer. Graduate Scholarship Requirements For a graduate student, only the grades A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship. Information concerning graduate student course load requirements and satisfactory aca\u00ad demic progress is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 53 Enrollment in University Extension If a UCI student wishes to enroll in a University Extension course concurrently with enrollment in regular courses, the entire program of study must be approved in advance by the dean of the student's school (in the case of graduate students, by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research). Credits From Other Institutions: Undergraduate Students UCI undergraduate students who wish to enroll in courses at another institution in either a summer or regular session and to use such courses to satisfy any UCI requirements must secure approval from the Office of Admissions and their academic dean. If such courses are determined by the Office of Admis\u00ad sions to be transferable, and if such courses do not duplicate other credit granted and do not exceed limitations of credit, then the units earned may be applied toward the total required for graduation. The student's academic dean will determine the applicability of such' transfer credit toward the satisfaction of specific program requirements. Students are urged to secure, in advance of enrolling in courses, authorization from the Office of Admissions and their academic deans to apply such courses toward UCI requirements. Only then will the applicability of such courses be guaranteed. Forms for securing such authorization are available in the Office of Admissions and in deans' offices. Such advance authorization is not required; however, students may seek it for their own assurance. Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Graduate Students Graduate students may be granted unit credit (not grade credit) toward a master's degree for acceptable graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through University Exten\u00ad sion prior to first enrollment in graduate study at UCI. After enrollment, the student must initiate a formal petition for such credit. Approval of the student's Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Dean is required. While enrolled at UCI or on a Leave of Absence a graduate student may receive unit credit for graduate-level courses com\u00ad pleted at another institution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the student's Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Dean. See the Graduate Studies and Research section for further information about graduate transfer credit and the University's Intercampus Exchange Program. UC IRVINE - 1981-198254 ENROLLMENT AND OTHER PROCEDURES ENROLLMENT AND OTHER PROCEDURES Except where noted, all information applies to both undergrad\u00ad uate and graduate students. Additional information concerning enrollment and academic policies applying only to graduate stu\u00ad dents is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Enrollment and \u00b7Payment of Fees To receive academic credit for regular courses and other super\u00ad vised instruction or research, a student must be officially enrolled prior to undertaking such activities. Enrollment does not become official until all required fees have been paid, and the student's Enrollment in Classes Petition has been completed correctly, signed where necessary, and sub\u00ad mitted to the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollments as indicated on the Class Verification and Identification Card are correct. The Schedule of Classes is provided by the Registrar's Office with registration materials approximately six weeks before the beginning of each quarter. The most important form in the reg\u00ad istration materials is the Enrollment in Classes Petition. It should be filled out carefully, according to the instructions pro\u00ad vided on the form and in the Schedule of Classes. A quarterly calendar of dates for submission of enrollment materials and payment of fees is included in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. The general procedures for enrollment are: 1. Consult the appropriate academic advisor to develop an approved program of study. Secure necessary signatures on the Enrollment in Classes Petition for courses that require special approval. New undergraduate students entering in the fall are encouraged to attend one of the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) sessions during the summer for academic advising and enrollment assistance. 2. Submit the completed class enrollment and student informa\u00ad tion forms to the Registrar. 3. Pay required fees to the Cashier. Any other outstanding obligations must be satisfied at this rime also. Class Verification and Identification Card After payment of fees and submission of enrollment materials, a Class Verification and Identification Card is available for each student. The Card lists the courses in which a student is enrolled. If any courses requested could not be scheduled, they are listed also, with the reason why the student is not enrolled in the course. Changes to course enrollments after receipt of the Card are handled through Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Cards, available from the student's academic dean's office or the Registrar. New undergraduate students are required to call in person at their academic deans' offices to secure their Class Verification and Identification Cards and advice concerning their academic programs. Continuing undergraduate students and graduate students should consult the quarterly Schedule of Classes for instruc\u00ad tions on where to secure their cards. The Class Verification and Identification Card is certification of the student's class enrollment and is evidence that the student is registered at UCI and is entitled to Library privileges. In addi\u00ad tion, the Card provides identification for Associated Students functions. If the Card is lost, there is a $3 replacement charge. Inquiries regarding the replacement of lost cards should be directed to th'e office that issued the Card. Late Enrollment and Payment of Fees Students who submit enrollment materials and pay fees within the published periods are not subject to late service fees. Those who do not submit an Enrollment in Classes Petition to the Registrar's Office during the published period are subject to a late service\u00b7 fee of $25. Students who do not pay all required fees to the Cashier's Office during the published period for payment of fees are subject to a late service fee of $10. If fees are not paid by the established deadline prior to the beginning of instruction, the student is subject to both late service fees (total $35) if allowed to enroll and pay fees after the deadline. To avoid the expense and inconvenience of late enrollment, students are urged to enroll and pay fees well before the pub\u00ad lished deadlines. Students with financial need should make advance arrangements with the Financial Aid Office, or another source, to have funds available when fees are due. The Registrar does not have authority to allow a student to pay fees after the deadline date, or to waive the late fees, except in unusual cases where the University is responsible for the late transaction. A student who is allowed to apply late and, as a result, must pay fees and enroll late, is required to pay late service fees. Change of Class Enrollment After official enrollment materials have been filed with the Registrar, a student may add or drop courses, change sections of a course, or change the grading option by completing an Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, available from the student's academic dean's office. An undergraduate student may not enroll in more than 20 units (excluding Physical Education) nor fewer than 12 units of course work during a given quarter without the permission of the student's academic dean. Changes to Pass/Not Pass grading must not cause the student to exceed the limitations to Pass/Not Pass enrollment. Graduate students may not enroll in more than 16 or fewer than eight units of graduate or upper-division credit without prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982During the first six weeks of each quarter, a student may add classes provided approval to add each class is granted by the instructor in charge. To add a class, a student must obtain the instructor's signature of approval on an Add Card, carefully complete the Add Card, and submit the card to the student's academic dean's office or the Registrar's Office no later than the end of the sixth week of instruction. To drop a class or change the grading option during the first two weeks of the quarter, a student must obtain the signature of the instructor in charge as evidence of notification on a Drop or Change of Grading Option Card and submit the card to the student's academic dean no later than the end of the second week of instruction. Students may drop classes from the third through the sixth week of a quarter, inclusive, only with the permission of the instructor in charge. A student wishing to drop a class during this period must obtain the signature of approval from the instructor in charge on a Drop Card and submit the card to the student's academic dean. After the sixth week of a quarter, students may drop a course only with the permission of the instructor and the student's academic dean. Permission to drop after the sixth week can be granted only if the student is not failing the course and not sub\u00ad ject to disqualification, and only if dropping the course would be to the educational benefit of the student and/ or of the class as a whole. To drop a class after the sixth week, a student must complete a Drop Card, obtain the instructor's signature of approval, and submit the card to the student's academic dean for the dean's action. Graduate students must have the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research to drop a course after the sixth week. Every student enrolled in a laboratory course in which equip\u00ad ment is issued is responsible for the equipment when dropping a course and will not be permitted to drop until the equipment is accounted for. Students are responsible for their official enrollment and must be officially enrolled in each class for which they expect credit. They must officially drop classes they have ceased attending. The student cannot simply discontinue attendance in a class; a Drop Card must be filed or the student will receive an F grade in the class. Courses may not be added or dropped retroac\u00ad tively. Students are urged to verify their official enrollment dur\u00ad ing the eighth week of the quarter; Students enrolling for the next quarter will find this information included with enrollment materials for the next quarter. Th6se students not enrolling for the next quarter can verify their official enrollment by inquiring at the Registrar's Office. There is a $3 service charge for all add, drop, or change transac\u00ad tions received in the Registrar's Office after the second week of classes. Lapse of Status A student's status may lapse for the following reasons: Failure to pay required student fees by the prescribed deadline; failure to respond to official notices; failure to settle financial obligations when due or to make satisfactory arrangements with the Cashier's Office; failure to complete the physical examina\u00ad tion; or failure to comply with admission conditions. ENROLLMENT AND 01HER PROCEDURES 55 Each student who becomes subject to \"lapse of status action\" is given advance notice and ample time to deal with the situation. However, if the student fails to respond, action will be taken without further notice, and the student will be dropped from all courses and will be entitled to no further services of the Univer\u00ad sity except assistance toward reinstatement. A student who desires to be reinstated must satisfy the conditions which caused the \"lapse of status\" and pay a $10 reinstatement fee at the Cashier's Office. Transcript of Records The transcript of a student's academic records will be released only upon a signed request of the student authorizing the release. Application for a transcript should be submitted to the Cashier's Office with a check or money order payable to Regents-UC for the exact amount due. The fee for transcripts is $2 for the first copy and $1 for each additional copy ordered at the same. All outstanding debts to the University (with the exception of long-term financial aid loans not yet due and pay\u00ad able) must be paid in full before a transcript will be released. When a student orders a transcript sent to another college, uni\u00ad versity, or agency, it is extremely important for the student to provide a complete and acc~rate mailing address to ensure delivery to the correct office. At least two weeks should be allowed for a transcript to be sent to another institution or agency. Diplomas Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is about 90 days after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Students may then call in person at the Registrar's Office or authorize the Registrar to deliver their diplomas by certified mail, or registered air mail to foreign countries. There is a service charge of $2 for certified mail, $3 for registered air mail, payable to Regents-UC. All outstanding debts due to the University, with the exception of long-term financial aid loans, must be paid in full before a student's diploma will be released. Cancellation Prior to Start of Instruction A student who pays fees for a regular academic quarter and then decides to leave the University prior to the first day of classes must submit a Notice of Cancellation, with the identifi\u00ad cation card attached, to the appropriate dean's office. With the exception of new undergraduate students, there is a $10 service charge for Cancellation prior to the first day of classes. Withdrawal From the University After the Start of Instruction After classes begin for a regular academic quarter, an enrolled student who decides to leave the University before the end of that quarter must submit an official Notice of Withdrawal. A student who fails to submit a Notice of Withdrawal will receive failing grades in all courses and severely jeopardize academic standing at the University. UC IRVINE - 1981-198256 ENROLLMENT AND OTI-IER PROCEDURES Undergraduate students must submit the notice, with the identi\u00ad fication card attached, to the Assistant Vice Chancellor\u00ad Student Affairs. Graduate students must submit the notice to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, and students in the College of Medicine must submit it to the College of Medicine Director of Admissions and Records. In extenuating .circum\u00ad stances, such as illness or emergency, the student should notify the appropriate dean or office as soon as possible in order to initiate withdrawal procedures. The effective date of the with\u00ad drawal will be determined by the appropriate dean. A graduate student in good academic standing who wishes to withdraw and intends to return within one year may submit both the Notice of Withdrawal and an application for a Leave of Absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. Further information about Leaves of Absence appears in the Graduate Studies and Research section. If a student plans to leave the University after completing all academic work for the latest quarter of enrollment and has not paid fees for the next quarter, a formal Notice of Withdrawal is not necessary. See page 45 for information on fee refunds. Readmission: Undergraduate Students We strongly urge students to consider the policy below in for\u00ad mulating plans for leaving or returning to UCI. Every effort will be made to readmit UCI students who were in good academic standing at the time of dropping out and who have filed read\u00ad mission applications. Readmission is not automatic. A student must file an Applica\u00ad tion for Readmission with the Registrar's Office at least eight weeks prior to the quarter in which readmission is desired and pay a nonrefundable $25 Application Fee at the Cashier's Office. If a student has been academically disqualified from the Univer\u00ad sity or has left the University while on probation or subject to disqualification, the student must apply for readmission in the manner prescribed above. The application, however, will be forwarded to the dean of the school which the student hopes to enter. If the dean decides that the student is serious about aca\u00ad demic life, and/ or that the student has displayed capability at another academic institution, the student will most likely be allowed readmission to the University. Transcripts for work taken at other institutions must be sub\u00ad mitted as part of the application. A nonrefundable fee of $25 is charged for each Application for Readmission. Remittance by bank draft or money order payable to Regents-UC must be at\u00ad tached to the application. Readmission: Graduate Students A graduate student who withdraws and has not been granted a Leave of Absence approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research can resume graduate study only if readmitted. An application for readmission must be submitted by the published deadline for graduate admission applications. Please refer to the statement on Readmission which appears in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Intercampus Transfer: Undergraduates Only An undergraduate student in good standing may transfer from the UCI campus to another campus of the University of Cali\u00ad fornia. To do so, the student should first check with the UCI Registrar to see which of the campuses are accepting transfers and which majors are being encouraged by each campus. The student then obtains an Intercampus Transfer Application form from the UCI Registrar's Office and files the form with the UCI Registrar by the deadline prescribed for the quarter in which the student wishes to transfer. The filing periods are winter quarter-July 1-31; spring quarter-October 1-31; fall quarter-November 1-30. After these dates, applications are accepted only until quotas are filled. A student may apply for only one campus in any given quarter. A nonrefundable fee of $25 is required for all Intercampus Transfer Applications filed with the Registrar's Office.

Staff members visit secondary schools and community colleges to interpret the policies and programs of the University and to seek information for the University about educational developments throughout the state. In cooperation with community colleges, ORSC staff mediates course articulation agreements and provides assistance with the transfer process. The ORSC staff is a resource to schools and to education-oriented groups, and responds to in\u00ad vitations requesting University representatives and participation in college advisement programs at schools and in the com\u00ad munity. Staff members also provide information for prospective students, teachers, parents, and counselors. On the UC Irvine campus, the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges provides a number of services for the prospective student. Program information is supplied in a variety of forms; brochures, flyers, films, and slide presentations are available, describing programs of study offered at UCI and explaining how students can qualify for admission. ORSC also schedules campus visits and tours, arranges educational conferences, sponsors a variety of on-campus activities for prospective stu\u00ad dents and educational groups, and assists prospective students in the application process. ORSC participates in the Access and Aspiration Model (AAM) Program for community college women, and sponsors a program of honors outreach to the high schools and community colleges. Student-led tours for prospec\u00ad tive students and their parents and school groups may be sched\u00ad uled through the Office by calling Campus Tours, (714) 833-5832. Four major programs within the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges are committed to the University of Cali\u00ad fornia's program of student affirmative action outreach at the undergraduate level. The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) for disadvantaged students may provide, according to the student's circumstances, special admissions consideration, financial aid, and academic support through advising and tutor\u00ad ing. The Student Affirmative Action Outreach Program is designed to attract underrepresented minority and disadvan\u00ad taged students who are regularly eligible for admission as under\u00ad graduates to the University of California. Younger students are the focus of the Early Outreach Program which comprises the Partnership Program and University Partners. The Partnership Program works with the junior high schools to increase the number of University-eligible students from low-income and underrepresented groups. University Partners is designed to maintain contact .with former Partnership students in the ninth and tenth grades. These programs are described below. Inquiries may be directed to the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges/Educational Opportunity Program, University of Cali\u00ad IRVINE - 1981-198258 SllJDENT AFFAIRS Educational Opportunity Program The goal of the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) is to encourage representation of disadvantaged students at UCI by assisting them in enrolling and succeeding at the University. The kinds of difficulties students encounter in seeking a college edu\u00ad cation may range from inadequate public school preparation to a lack of funds to support their education. The Educational Opportunity Program is designed to assist students in overcom\u00ad ing obstacles by providing counseling on admissions and finan\u00ad cial aid, and academic support through advising, tutoririg, and learning skills services. A special EOP summer session is offered to those students identified by EOP as most likely to benefit from this support program. Counseling on a continuing basis is available to all EOP students through the Counseling Center, the Tutorial Assistance Program, the Learning Skills Center, and the Special Services Office. Information and the EOP brochure may be obtained from the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges/Educational Opportunity Program, (714) 833-5410. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds are encouraged to apply. EOP assists those who are regularly admissible to the University, and also those who may not have met traditional admissions requirements but who can offer evidence supporting their ability to achieve at the University level. With the excep\u00ad tion of American Indians, only residents of the State of Califor\u00ad nia are eligible to apply for EOP sponsorship. American Indian applicants must document their tribal affiliation. Admission Prospective EOP students must complete the regular UC admis\u00ad sion forms and follow all procedures. EOP applicants should take particular care with the required essay and indicate their interest in EOP by marking the appropriate places provided on the application. Applications may be obtained from counseling offices in California high schools and community colleges or the UCI Office of Admissions. In addition, the EOP applicant is advised to submit two letters of recommendation from teachers, counselors, persons in the community, or employers, which document the student's background, motivation, and academic .potential. In those cases where entering the University at this time would not seem appropriate, the EOP staff may recommend a program of study in a community college or elsewhere, in order that the student may qualify for UCI at a later date. Financial Assistance Personal financial resources should not be the determining fac\u00ad tor in deciding whether or not to attend college. All students admitted to UCI, including EOP students, are eligible for finan\u00ad cial assistance on the basis of demonstrated need. Funds can be provided to cover room and board, fees, books and supplies, and living expenses, when a student or family is unable to fully meet these expenses. Financial aid is comprised of a combina\u00ad tion or \"package\" of grant, loan, scholarship, and/or part-time employment based on the individual circumstances of the appli\u00ad cant. See Financial Aid, page 46. Undergraduate Student Affirmative Action Outreach Program The purpose of the Student Affirmative Action Outreach Pro\u00ad gram is to attract underrepresented minority and disadvantaged students who are regularly admissible to UCI. Campus repre\u00ad sentatives visit high schools, community colleges, and com\u00ad munity centers to meet with students, parents, teachers, and school officials to discuss the outreach approach. The program also includes a series of seminars and workshops aimed at orienting students to specific academic disciplines, such as mathematics, physics, computer science, chemistry, biology, and engineering.

Consultation and support on effective media use, equipment, or any other aspect of audiovisual usage are available to the campus as a whole. For information telephone (714) 833-5128. Child Care Services Child Care Services, organized into four Centers, offers full\u00ad time and part-time programs for children. The Infant/Toddler Center provides services for children from six weeks to two and one-half years of age. The Verano Children's Center and the Children's Center both provide educational programs and care for children ages two and one-half to five; the Extended Day Care Center serves children ages five to 12. The programs are designed to meet the individual needs of each child. Toward UC IRVINE - 1981-198264 STUDENT AFFAIRS that end, the Centers provide environments in which diverse cul\u00ad tural, ethnic, and personal teaching and parenting styles are encouraged. The programs are open to children of UCI stu\u00ad dents, faculty, and staff, with priority enrollment and tuition subsidy available to students. Information may be obtained by visiting the Centers or telephoning ( 714) 833-62 76. Housing and Food Service The Central Housing Office coordinates application procedures and contracts with campus residents. On-campus residences are available for 1,550 single under\u00ad graduate students in Mesa Court and Middle Earth. UCI's resi\u00ad dence hall program emphasizes small-group living. Each hall houses from 40 to 60 students and a student resident assistant. The small-scale buildings provide excellent opportunities for social interaction, student government, and leadership expe\u00ad rience. Liberal use of wood in building design and picturesque landscaping help to create a home-like environment. The resi\u00ad dences are divided into suites of four or five double rooms, with living room and bath; each residence also contains a lounge and recreation and study rooms. A limited number of single rooms is also available in each residence. Every room has car\u00ad peting and draperies, and is furnished with a bed, desk, chair, chest of drawers, closet, and bookshelves for each student. Both Mesa Court and Middle Earth have complete food service and dining commons for their residents. The halls are, however, closed during the Christmas and spring recesses. Each hall tends to have distinctive characteristics and often focuses on a specific interest or life-style. Examples include halls devoted to the fine arts, the humanities, languages, the out\u00ad doors, or crafts. An additional housing option at UCI is the 80- space Recreational Vehicle Park. Students must provide their own vehicle. For further information, contact the Central Hous\u00ad ing Office. An apartment complex for single undergraduates was completed in 1981. This group of 200 two-bedroom apartments houses 800 students. Half of the units are furnished, and the others include carpeting, draperies, a stove, and a refrigerator. A vari\u00ad ety of programs is offered in the community center building, and in the complexes' two lounges and recreation buildings. Undergraduate applicants must indicate their interest in on\u00ad campus housing by marking the appropriate item on the UC Undergraduate Application for Admission in order to receive an application for housing. Prompt return of the Housing Application is important as housing priority is given based on the date of receipt of the completed housing application. Due to the large demand for housing, students wishing to live on cam\u00ad pus should apply for admission on November 1, when the application filing period opens, if they wish to live on campus the following fall. The application for admission allows the stu\u00ad dents to request information about off-campus housing as well. Students who become eligible for residence hall contracts will be obliged to pay approximately $100 as a reservation fee at the time the contract is returned to the University; any cancellation, regardless of the circumstances or time of year, will result in a nonrefundable penalty fee. The cost of room and board in the residence halls is paid in quarterly payments. The University also has 562 one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments in Verano Place for full-time registered students who are married, single parents, graduate students, or who are single and 25 years of age or older. Over half of the apartments are furnished, and all have carpeting, draperies, a stove, and a refrigerator. They are attractive and considerably lower in rent than comparable units in local communities. An assortment of social, cultural, and educational programs such as community dinners, courses, and workshops is offered in the community. Students may apply to live in Verano Place at any time by requesting an application from the Housing Office. An applica\u00ad tion fee of $20 must accompany the application. This amount becomes part of a $100 security deposit upon occupancy. In the event that a student wishes to cancel the application prior to receiving an assignment, the $20 is refunded. Application should be made at least six months in advance of the date the student wishes to move in. Students who live in the residence halls are provided with a prepaid meal plan. Meals are served cafeteria style, and the menu offers a wide selection of food, with fresh fruit and an array of salads daily. Meals are served three times daily on weekdays (brunch and dinner only on Saturdays and Sundays) in the Mesa Court and Middle Earth Commons. Students who live off campus may wish to take advantage of the Nonresident Meal Contract. This contract, good for any quar\u00ad ter, enables a student to eat 19 meals per week in Mesa Com\u00ad mons. For spring quarter, 1981, the price of the meal plan was $4.50 per day. Residential Learning The Student Programs Offices at Mesa Court and Middle Earth have the significant responsibility of providing student residents with an environment conducive to their intellectual, social, and personal growth. The housing staffs work closely with students to create opportunities for educational exploration and ways of developing interpersonal skills. Academically oriented residen\u00ad tial learning programs include the Social Science Center, Social Science Hall, Humanities House, Social Ecology Center, Foreign Language Programs, and Center for the Arts. The Outdoors and Photography Halls are examples of special interest hall pro\u00ad grams. Weekend field trips and retreats, designed to amplify on-campus experiences, are often part of the interest hall pro\u00ad grams. The Student Programs Offices also supervise and train resident assistants, advise the residential student government, and coordinate information and skill development workshops. Student Health Service All fully registered students are eligible for Student Health Ser\u00ad vice benefits under the UCI program. Student Health facilities include a complete outpatient clinic, staffed by physicians and nurses, supported by an x-ray and clinical laboratory. General medical clinics are held 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day during the week. Specialty clinics are held. at variously scheduled times by appointment and include Dermatology, Gynecology, Ortho\u00ad pedics, Mental Health, Birth Control, Minor Surgery, Nutri\u00ad tion/Weight Control, and Ear, Nose, and Throat. Emergency service is provided after regular hours and on weekends when school is in session. An infirmary provides inpatient care for students who need bed care. The main telephone number for Student Health is (714) 833-5301. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982In addition to the campus facility, there is a basic insurance pro\u00ad gram which provides limited coverage for emergency care and hospitalization when such care is required but not available at the Student Health Service. Each fully registered student at UCI will automatically have this limited Health and Accident Insur\u00ad ance plan in effect. To assure coverage each student is required to have a current medical history and physical examination on file at the Student Health Service. Undergraduate students are mailed medi\u00ad cal history and physical examination forms after they return their $50 Undergraduate Acceptance of Admission Fee; gradu\u00ad ate and medical students should visit the Center when they arrive at UCI to obtain and complete the forms. Students should check with the Student Health Service for information on the benefits and limitations under the insurance plan. Professional counseling and help for emotional problems are available through the Mental Health Division of the Student Health Services. Psychiatric and psychological services, weight control clinics, and headache and biofeedback relaxation train\u00ad ing are available. Student Health coverage provides as many services as possible without additional charge; however, some services are available only on a fee-for-service basis. Some of the services available at moderate charges are immunizations, allergy desensitization injections, prescriptions from the Student Health Pharmacy, dental services including minor surgery, elective laboratory tests, and, time permitting, physical examinations for employment, insurance, or a marriage license. Eye care is available to students and their spouses at the Eye Clinic located in the Student Health Center. Appointments with the Ophthalmologist can be made by calling (714) 833-5304.

Health education pro\u00ad grams offered through Student Health include CPR, First Aid, Blood Drive, Rape Prevention, UCIMC Emergency Care Patient Counseling, and Plaque Control. For information regarding these courses and programs call ( 714) 833-5806. During the academic year students may listen to any of 100 taped health messages that provide information about a variety of illnesses and health problems, and their recognition, preven\u00ad tion, and/ or treatment. Any of the taped messages may be heard by calling (714) 833-5472. Student Health coverage extends from the first day of the quar\u00ad ter to but not including the first day of the following quarter, but begins only after the student has paid the full Registration Fee and has been issued the Class Verification and Identification Card. There is an exception for spring quarter coverage which extends only to the last day of that quarter. The Student Health Service encourages preventive medicine. It supplements but does not supplant the family physician. Full and mutual cooperation between the Student Health Service and the family physician is encouraged. STUDENT AFFAIRS 65 Optional additional insurance for students, spouses, and chil\u00ad dren is available at the Student Health Service. Optional insur\u00ad ance coverage also is available for the summer or one unregis\u00ad tered quarter each year. Enrollment in this plan is limited to a short time at the beginning of each quarter. Stop by the Student Health Center for more information and application forms dur\u00ad ing the first week of each quarter to assure coverage. Physical Examinations and Health Clearances. All new students are required to have a complete physical examination within 90 days prior to the first day of the quarter. The exami\u00ad nation should be performed by the student's own physician. If this is impractical, the examination can be obtained at the Stu\u00ad dent Health Service for a moderate charge. Please call for an appointment. Students returning to UCI after an absence of two or more quarters are required to have a health clearance by the Student Health Service. Students returning after participation in the Education Abroad Program must comply with this requirement upon their return to UCI. Commencement UCI Commencement ceremonies are he.ld in Campus Park each June. Students who graduate any quarter of the academic year may participate in the year-end graduation ceremony. Com\u00ad mencement protocol information is mailed to all prospective graduates in late spring and also is available in the office of each academic counselor. For further information, call the Com\u00ad mencement Committee representative, (714) 833-6378. Student Conduct and Discipline In order to make the administration of campus activities coher\u00ad ent and consistent, the Office of the Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs provides students with a handbook setting forth the standards of conduct expected of UCI students. This booklet, \"Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students,\" gives the rules concerning conduct and related mat\u00ad ters, as established by the policies of The Regents and the Presi\u00ad dent of the University. Campus regulations are available also. Students enrolling in the University are expected to assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the University's function as an educational institution. The booklet is a reinforcement of that assumption. Copies are avail\u00ad able from Campus Organization Services, located in the Univer\u00ad sity Center. An Ombudsman is available to assist students with any problems or concerns they may encounter while at UCI, including those related to student conduct and discipline. The Ombudsman is located in the Office of the Vice Chancellor\u00ad Student Affairs. Associated Students The Associated Students of the University of California, Irvine (ASUCI), with offices located in the University Center, is com\u00ad posed of all registered undergraduate students at UC Irvine, whose quarterly student fees allow this nonprofit organization to provide leadership, representation, programs of entertain\u00ad ment, and academic and social services. Services. ASUCI funds, manages, and operates numerous stu\u00ad dent services on campus. The weekly New University newspaper; La Voz Mestiza, and The Blade newspapers; and KUCI (89.9 FM) radio are student-operated campus media. The College UC IRVINE - 1981-198266 STUDENT AFFAIRS Legal Clinic provides free legal assistance to students on almost all matters. The ASUCI Travel Service offers charter informa\u00ad tion, booking services, passport photo service, and student travel identification. Enhancing the quality of our environment is the long-range goal of the ASUCI Recycling Center. The ASUCI Information Desk, located just inside the entrance to ASUCI, has knowledgeable receptionists to answer questions and provide directions. The ASUCI Ticket Office, open from 9:30a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, dispenses several business and com\u00ad mercial services. Tickets for on-campus and off-campus (Ticket\u00ad ron) events are available, with those for ASUCI programs often priced nominally or free to students. The Ticket Office also has a check-cashing service. ASUCI entertainment services offer all students varying diver\u00ad sions for their leisure hours. Noon concerts are held bi-weekly in Gateway Plaza. Major concerts occur in Crawford Hall at least twice a quarter, and popular films are shown on weekends at reduced rates. Speakers appear periodically under ASUCI's sponsorship, with lectures covering politics, economics, humor, and humanism. On weekends one can choose the relaxed atmosphere of the Soundstage where UCI students often per\u00ad form. A Bluegrass Festival is held in the fall, and each spring Wayzgoose, a student festival with a Renaissance theme, is held in Campus Park. These programs are operated by executive commissions, which all students are encouraged to join. The UCI Pep Band, Pep Club, and Pep Squad, partially funded by ASUCI, provide sup\u00ad port for UCI athletic teams and University events with rallies, dances, rooter sections, and spirit-raising activities. Organization. The ASUCI government consists of a 26- member Council, including 21 representatives from the aca\u00ad demic schools and programs, and five executive officers. The five executive officers are elected for one-year terms by the stu\u00ad dent body each spring. Their general task is the setting of goals and policy making to achieve ASUCI's primary goal, a Univer\u00ad sity wholly responsive to student needs and desires. The Presi\u00ad dent handles Universitywide affairs, instigates office and budget\u00ad ary efficiency, and provides focal spokesmanship for the Asso\u00ad ciated Students in policy dealings with the administration. In addition, the President coordinates and lobbies for student interests in the surrounding communities. The Executive Vice President chairs the legislative Council, sits on the Registration Fee Advisory Committee, and supervises the Elections Com\u00ad missioner. The Vice President for Academic Services is liaison to the\u00b7Academic Senate, coordinates student input in each school, and directs the Student Recommended Faculty Pro\u00ad gram, through which students nominate visiting lecturers. The Office also serves as the student voice in statewide academic affairs and assists students with informal and formal resolution of grievances when they arise. The Vice President for Adminis\u00ad tration chairs the Communications Board, and appoints and monitors over 60 student representatives to UCI administrative and Academic Senate committees. The Vice President for Stu\u00ad dent Services investigates new services, evaluates current pro\u00ad grams, and coordinates ASUCI publicity. The executive officers are aided by appointed commissioners who deal with the Stu\u00ad dent Lobby Annex, housing, student grievances, concerts, and more. ASUCI policy and budgetary decisions are promulgated by the Council. Each councilperson sits on at least one subcommittee of the Council. Council elections are held in fall and spring with 10 (or half) Council seats filled in each election. Representation. The nine UC campus student bodies are linked togther by the Student Body Presidents Council (SBPC), on which the ASUCI President serves. The SBPC carries out many activities, including advisement to the Board of Regents and selection of the student Regent, appointment of students to statewide University committees, and direction of the UC Stu\u00ad dent Lobby through which student interests are promoted in Sacramento and Berkeley (University Hall). On the Irvine campus, students are encouraged to participate in and are appointed to serve on the Chancellor's Advisory, ad hoc Academic Senate, and campus administrative committees. Involvement. ASUCI's primary goal is to further the control by students over their own curricula, funds, administration, and student life. All students concerned about academics, services, representation, or entertainment can reach their Council repre\u00ad sentative or the executive officers at ASUCI, University Center, (714) 833-5547. Associated Graduate Students All graduate students are automatically members of the Asso\u00ad ciated Graduate Students (AGS). AGS is\u00b7governed by a Council of members elected from each academic unit conducting a grad\u00ad uate program, and the President, who is elected in a campus\u00ad wide election held during spring quarter. The AGS Council is an independent entity within UCI, with the exclusive reponsibil\u00ad ity as the elected student body for representation of all graduate students to the UCI administration, Systemwide, and the com\u00ad munity-at-large. The Associated Graduate Student Council nom\u00ad inates graduate students\" for positions on all UCI administrative committees, councils, special and ad hoc committees, the UCI Academic Senate committees, and Systemwide committees. The Associated Graduate Student Council utilizes the quarterly Associated Graduate Student Fee to provide funding for gradu\u00ad ate student projects as well as to support activities that benefit the campus community. AGS representatives also work actively with the Student Body Presidents Council and the Student Lob\u00ad by in efforts to implement legislation which is supportive of stu\u00ad dents and crucial to the social needs of the wider community. Medical Students Organization The Medical Students Organization (MSO) is governed by an elected student council composed of two officers from each class and a student body President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. This council represents the medical student body in all matters relating to the UCI campus, UC Systemwide, and the community. The Associated Students fee paid by each medical student is used, in part, to support the campuswide programs and activi\u00ad ties of the ASUCI and specific medical student activities, including student organizations, the yearbook, speakers, movies, and maintenance of recreational facilities.

Yahr, Ph.D. University of Texas, Associate Professor of Psychobiology No one can predict the future, but this much is known: the next quarter century is the time of the biologist, who will be in the midst of many of the activities that govern major aspects of life. These include some of the most challenging intellectual prob\u00ad lems, such as the mechanisms of memory and of learning, the molecular basis of embryonic development, and the rules that help predict the behavior of the environment. Biology also lies at the heart of major social problems that face mankind in the coming decade, such as sensible management of the environ\u00ad ment and the effective control of human populations. It is vital that educated men and women understand the contributions that biological sciences have made and will continue to make for the future welfare of mankind. The School of Biological Sciences reflects new concepts of biol\u00ad ogy in both its curriculum and its research programs. The faculty is dedicated to providing students with the opportunity to avail themselves of the principles and ever-increasing knowl\u00ad edge of biology. The .curriculm is designed to meet present and future educational needs of majors and nonmajors. In keeping with the responsibilities of the University, the School encour\u00ad ages vigorous faculty and student research programs. It strongly believes that excellence in research is essential for effective, enthusiastic, and up-to-date teaching. Each quarter nearly 300 undergraduate students and 150 graduate and postdoctoral stu\u00ad dents participate in independent research programs. In addition to the regular University requirements for admis\u00ad sion, students interested in the biological sciences should include in their high school curriculum four years of mathe\u00ad matics, biology, and especially chemistry and physics, which are now an integral part of most contemporary biological work. The biological sciences are presented as an integrated area of study through the 12-course Biological Sciences Core, with lec\u00ad tures and laboratories developing the major concepts of modern biology. Satellite courses expand upon and intensify areas covered in the Core and provide students with the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of the biological sciences. In addition to the regular major in Biological Sciences, a concen\u00ad tration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, also leading to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences, is available at the undergrad\u00ad uate level. The degree requirements of these two programs are similar, with the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology placing a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a lesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biol\u00ad ogy. Introductory courses for nonmajors are designed to make the biological sciences meaningful and interesting and to inform 'intelligent citizens of biological phenomena that affect their daily lives. Graduate courses are offered in all the departments. BIOLOOICAL SCIENCES 69 Students with an interest in the application of ecology to human needs may choose the Applied Ecology major, leading to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology, which is offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. See page 200. Degrees Biological Sciences ................ B.S., M.A.T., M.S., Ph.D. A concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is avail\u00ad able at the undergraduate level.

Students must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average in the Biological Sciences Core Curriculum and three satellite courses. In addition to the listed Biological Sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C and Physics 18A-B-C can be used to satisfy the satellite requirement. Students with a double major in Psychology and Biological Sciences can also use Psychology 151A-B-C to satisfy the satellite requirement. No student may enter as a double major, but students interested in other areas may possibly become double majors after the first quarter, if the second school or program approves. A strong academic performance in the second area is requisite for accep\u00ad tance as a double major. For information on requirements for the B.S. degree in Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences with a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, see page 71. UCI Breadth Requirement Those students majoring in Biological Sciences who have com\u00ad pleted the School requirements and who have passed any two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core or its alternative with a grade of C-( 1. 7) or better will have satis\u00ad fied the UCI breadth requirement, with two exceptions: the upper-division Writing Requirement and Category III, Social and Behavioral Sciences.

Normally students must satisfy the Subject A requirement prior to fulfilling the lower-division Writing Requirement. Students taking Humanities lA must also enroll in Writing Workshop (2 units) if they have not satisfied the Subject A requirement. [:;1.

Students who take the mathe\u00ad matics requirement in their sophomore year should defer physics to their junior year. Physics 3A-B-C is the course for nonmajors and is fully acceptable for a degree in the Biological Sciences. Physics SA-B-C, which begins in the winter quarter, better prepares a student for Physical Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C and for some graduate schools. \u00b7 1 Electives should be chosen with the followin(p~poses listed sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C, Physics 18A-B-C, and Psychology lSI A-B-C (for Biological Sci\u00ad ences/Psychology double majors) are counted as satellites. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982component are passed with a grade of C-or better. Chemistry and physics satisfy Category II, Natural Sciences. Category V, Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Computer Science, is satisfied by completion of the School mathematics requirement. Planning a Program of Study Since biological sciences courses are built upon a base of the physical sciences, it is important for students to take their required physical sciences early. Freshmen will normally take eight units of the humanities re\u00ad quirement, Chemistry lA, and a freshman seminar (Biological Sciences 2) during the fall quarter. Students with a score of 650 or higher on the Mathematics part of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) may enroll in mathematics during the fall quarter. Please note the prerequisites for Mathematics 2A. During win\u00ad ter quarter, students will begin the Biological Sciences Core with Biological Sciences 90. Sophomores begin organic chemistry (Chemistry SlA), con\u00ad tinue the Biological Sciences Core, and complete the Humani\u00ad ties requirement if they have not taken it during their freshman year. Sophomores often begin taking courses in other schools to meet the UCI breadth requirement and fulfill their mathematics requirement if they have not done so as freshmen. Sophomores who have completed the mathematics requirement as freshmen may enroll in physics. Students who intend to double major in Chemistry may be required to take Physics SA-B-C in place of Physics 3A-B-C. During their junior year, most majors continue the Biological Sciences Core and take physics if they have not yet done so. Juniors complete their breadth requirements and often become involved in the satellite course requirements. Since most satel\u00ad lites are based upon material cont~ined in the Core, it is usually preferable for students to have completed most of the Core before taking satellite courses. Finally, during their senior year, students complete the Core and may become involved in an area of specialization within the School. A special program of study should be considered by students who enter the biological sciences with a weak background in the sciences and in writing skills. A weak background might consist of not completing high school chemistry or mathematics through trigonometry, and not satisfying the Subject A requirement before entering the University. This program allows a student to gain the necessary background skills and may require five years of study at the undergraduate level. Before beginning this program of study, students must see an academic counselor in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Freshmen should complete Writing 1 A, Mathematics 1, Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences 2, and an additional humanities course (to satisfy the alternative to the Humanities Core) during the fall quarter. The winter quarter should include Chemistry 10 and continua\u00ad tion of humanities and mathematics. Continuation of humani\u00ad ties and mathematics, and an elective, are taken during the spring quarter. BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 71 During the second year, students should begin general chemistry (Chemistry lA-B-C), continue working on the breadth requirement and any remaining humanities requirements, and complete mathematics. During winter quarter-, students will begin the Biological Sciences Core with Biological Sciences 90. The Biological Sciences Core, organic chemistry (Chemistry SlA-B-C), and elective courses should be taken during the third year. The fourth year should include Physics 3A-B-C, continuation of the Biological Sciences Core, biological sciences satellites, and possibly research or other electives. The fifth year should be relatively free to explore additional satellites and research and to complete any remaining Biological Sciences Core courses. Requirements for the B.S. Degree in Biological Sciences with a Concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology The School of Biological Sciences offers a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology which provides a second pathway to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences. The concentra\u00ad tion in Ecology and Environmental Biology differs from the regular undergraduate program in having a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a lesser emphasis on chem\u00ad istry and molecular biology. Its principal objective is to afford the student an integrated, interdisciplinary program in environ\u00ad mental studies within the framework of a broad and rigorous physical and biological sciences background. A vital goal is to allow the student completing the course of study to be broadly trained as a biologist, with the breadth of educational expe\u00ad rience to view environmental problems from an informed ecol\u00ad ogist's perspective. In addition to completing basic required courses in the humanities and the physical and biological sci\u00ad ences, the student must complete a core of environmentally based courses from the Department of Ecology and Evolution\u00ad ary Biology, the Program in Social Ecology, and the School of Engineering. Exposure to current thought in several subareas of ecology is emphasized, and the acquisition of elementary statis\u00ad tical and computer skills is-stressed. Opportunities to specialize in several general study areas are furnished. Students will study theoretical concepts and experimental relationships in terrestrial or aquatic systems through Ecology and Evolutionary Biology satellite courses, but may also choose to specialize in the demo\u00ad graphic and planning aspects of environmental management through classes in Social Ecology, or the technological approach to environmental problem solving through advanced course work in environmental engineering. Students with an engineering perspective are encouraged to explore the program options in environmental engineering (p. 216), offered by the School of Engineering. Students should also investigate the Applied Ecology major (p. ZOO), offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecology. The Applied Ecology major emphasizes ecology as it pertains to human needs, whereas the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology emphasizes ecology as a basic science.

Students must attain a 2.0 grade point average in required Bio\u00ad logical Sciences courses. Planning a Program of Study A normal program of study for the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is similar to that for the regular Bio\u00ad logical Sciences major, except that Biological Sciences 102 and 120 are normally taken in the sophomore year. In the junior and senior years a program of study in Ecology and Environmental Biology requires Information and Computer Science 1 rather than Biological Sciences 107. In addition, required electives in biological sciences, engineering, and social ecology replace the requirement for three satellite courses. The UCI breadth requirement may be satisfied in the concen\u00ad tration in Ecology and Environmental Biology in a manner sim\u00ad ilar to the regular Biological Sciences major. Further clarification on the concentration in Ecology and Environrr.ental Biology may be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Special Programs and Courses Biological Sciences 199 Every undergraduate student in the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences has the opportunity to pursue independent research in a professor's laboratory in the School of Biological Sciences or in the College of Medicine as an apprentice scientist. Under the guidance of a senior scientist, the student is able to experience the challenge and excitement of the world of science and to develop new scientific skills. This activity may commence as early as the sophomore year or, in the case of exceptional stu\u00ad dents, earlier. Interested students should investigate the possibilities for research early in order to obtain a great deal of research expe\u00ad rience, if they so desire, before they graduate. Although we do not require training in a foreign language, some areas of research demand that students possess foreign language skills. Students are, therefore, encouraged to discuss foreign language needs with their advisors to see if such training is important for their own careers. Advising for research careers in the biological sci\u00ad ences is best accomplished by students working together with their faculty advisors. Excellence in Research Program The School of Biological Sciences believes that successful par\u00ad ticipation in creative research is one of the highest academic goals our undergraduates can attain and accordingly rewards such students with Excellence in Biological Sciences Research.

UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Through undergraduate research and the Excellence in Research Program in Biological Sciences, students have the opportunity of presenting the results of their research endeavors to peers and faculty; and possibly of seeing their research papers pub\u00ad lished. With successful completion of this Program the students are awarded Excellence in Research certificates. Selected papers are published in the School's journal of Undergraduate Research in the Biological Sciences. All Biological Sciences majors doing experimental research under Biological Sciences 199 who have completed a minimum of three quarters (with at least one quarter taken during the academic year of the symposium) are eligible to participate. They must be in good academic standing and making normal progress in biological sciences. Research Enrichment Program The Research Enrichment Program is open to highly qualified sophomores and juniors who are interested in either health or life science research. Students may apply at the end of their freshman year to participate in the following year. The program offers students special seminars, guest speakers, field trips, and individual projects. It is the goal of the program to introduce students to as many and varied areas of biology as possible, with the intention of participating in a 199 research project the following year. Selection into the program is based on inter\u00ad views and overall academic records. Marine Ecology Super Course For the winter quarter of odd years, Biological Sciences 181 (Advanced Marine Ecology) and 182 (Applied Marine Produc\u00ad tivity), or a similar grouping, will be combined into a Marine Ecology Super Course. These courses, with a Biological Sciences 199 research course, will constitute a student's entire winter quarter curriculum. The course is limited to 20 students with selection based on a questionnaire and interview. Prerequisites are completion of Biological Sciences 102 and consent of instructor. Terrestrial Ecology Super Course For the spring quarter of even years, Biological Sciences 167 '(Field Ecology), 172 (Physiological Plant Ecology), and 173 (Physiological Animal Ecology), or a similar grouping, will be combined into a Terrestrial Ecology Super Course. These courses, with a Biological Sciences 199 research course, will constitute a student's entire spring quarter curriculum. The course is limited to 20 students with selection based on a ques\u00ad tionnaire and interview. Prerequisites are completion of Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences 102 and consent of instructor. Undergraduate Seminars In addition to research opportunities, there are freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior seminars which enable students to meet in small groups with individual professors. Topics vary from quarter to quarter. Exciting developments in modern biology as well as other topics of interest to students are dis\u00ad cussed. Some of the areas are regeneration, developmental biol\u00ad ogy of marine invertebrates, immunology, regulation of enzyme action and synthesis, human ecology, population ecology, exper\u00ad imental neuroanatomy, and neural and endocrine bases of behavior. BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 73 Undergraduate Teaching Opportunities Through the Education Motivation Program and the Tutoring Program, students can immediately put to practice skills they have learned in their biology training. These programs provide opportunities for students to develop teaching abilities and to perform a worthwhile and necessary service. In the Education Motivation Program, present biological sciences majors go into the elementary and junior high schools to motivate students toward a career in the sciences. In the Tutoring Program, UCI students tutor other ucr students in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. \u00b7 3-2 Program in the Graduate School of Management Students who are interested in a career in administration and who will have completed all of the course requirements for a degree in, Biological Sciences by the end of their junior year may apply to a cooperative 3-2 program which leads to a Master's degree in Administration as well as the Bachelor's degree in Bio\u00ad logical Sciences. During the senior year, students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 elec\u00ad tive units needed to receive the Bachelor's degree. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the conclusion of the first year in the 3-2 program, the B.S. degree in the Biological Sciences will be awarded. The M.S. de\u00ad gree in Management will be awarded after successful completion of course requirements, ordinarily at the end of the fifth year. Special Research Resources Special research resources include the Laser Microbeam Pro\u00ad gram (LAMP), a research, training, and service facility in the area of laser microbeam technology; the School of Biological Sciences Biohazard (P-3) Facility, which provides laboratory facilities for working with biological agents or biological mole\u00ad cules such as recombinant DNA which would be hazardous when used in open laboratories; the Museum of Systematic Biology, a teaching and research facility which currently con\u00ad tains material on local populations of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates; the Developmental Biology Center, devoted to ana\u00ad lyzing developmental mechanisms in amphibians, insects, and other invertebrates; the Irvine Arboretum, a botanical garden facility; the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, which sup\u00ad ports controlled marsh biota; the Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve, a high-desert habitat in San Bernardino County; and the UCI Ecology Preserve, which includes coastal hills on the campus, once under heavy grazing, but now returning to a more natural state. It is important to note that the School has access to the College of Medicine on our campus, thereby providing an opportunity for the sharing of both teaching and research activities. Advising: Academic, Career, Health. Sciences Academic Advising The Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office coordinates the advising program and provides academic counseling as well as special services particularly in the area of preprofessional career counseling. The Office also houses the office of the Counselor UC IRVINE - 1981-198274 BIOLOOICAL SCIENCES for Special Programs. This office is responsible for academic counseling, coordination of special services, and professional career counseling specifically for minority and E.O.P. (Educa\u00ad tional Opportunity Program) students. All freshmen will be enrolled in small-group freshman seminars (Biological Sciences 2 ). All other new students will be enrolled in special sections of Biological Sciences 190. The professor conducting the seminar will be the student's faculty advisor. Upper-division peer advisors .will be actively involved in these seminars. Peer Academic Advisors. The Peer Academic Advisors are upper-division Biological Sciences majors who bring with them valuable academic and social experiences. Their functions include counseling students in matters of major selection, pro\u00ad gram planning, petitioning, tutoring, learning skills problems, and participation in cocurricular and extracurricular activities. The Peer Advisors are located near the Student Affairs Office. Office hours are posted at the beginning of each quarter, and anyone should feel free to drop by and discuss any social or academic problems. Career Advising Information on graduate and professional schools in the health sciences can be obtained from the Student Affairs Office. Addi\u00ad tional career information and job opportunities are available through the UCI Career Planning and Placement Office. Areas of opportunity open to those with a Bachelor of Science degree include laboratory technology, publishing, technical edit\u00ad ing, pharmaceutical sales, and training programs in county, state, and federal agencies. The bachelor's degree is necessary to pursue studies leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. A B.S. degree, plus short training periods, may prepare students for employment in education, medical technology (usually one year), physical therapy, and various other areas. Education (community colleges, state colleges, or private schools), medical illustration, and public health (which includes hospital administration, biostatistics, epidemiology, environ\u00ad mental health sciences, social work, public health education, maternal and child health, and infectious and tropical diseases) are fields in which opportunities are available upon completion of a Master's grogram. The Ph.D. degree may lead to research in many areas, among them bacteriology, biochemistry, biometeorology, botany, cytol\u00ad ogy, ecology, fishery biology, genetics, home economics, micro\u00ad biology, pathology, physiology, psychobiology, public health, range management, soil conservation, and zoology. Other areas where advanced degrees are necessary include med\u00ad icine, dentistry, law, optometry, podiatry, osteopathy, and vet\u00ad erinary medicine. Health Sciences Advising Advising for careers in the health sciences is a specialty of the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Students desiring to enter the health sciences should have their programs checked in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. They should also check deadlines for taking the New Medical College Admission Test or other required tests and application deadlines. The New Medical College Admission Test, required by most medical schools, is administered in spring and fall of each year on the Irvine campus. This test should be taken in the spring, a year and one-half before the student plans to enter medical school. Many of our students desire a career related to their education in the biological sciences. Students can go into medicine, den\u00ad tistry, optometry, osteopathy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, and related medical fields; into teaching; and into research in the biological sciences. In properly preparing for such careers, plan\u00ad ning is essential early in a student's education. Leaders in dental, medical, and veterinary education recom\u00ad mend that students preparing to seek admission to their schools plan to obtain a bachelor's degree. Students who plan to enter a school of dentistry, medicine, or other areas of the health sci\u00ad ences may receive the required preprofessional training -on the Irvine campus. This preprofessional training may be accom\u00ad plished by ( 1) completing the major in Biological Sciences or (2) majoring in any school or department and fulfilling concur\u00ad rently the specific course requirements of the dental, medical, or other professional school the student expects to attend. Students interested in the health sciences should choose elec\u00ad tives in the social sciences, possibly a foreign language, physical chemistry, or other specific courses required or recommended by graduate schools. Student Participation BSSA. The School of Biological Sciences highly recommends undergraduate student participation in its activities. The Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences Student Association (BSSA) is an autonomous student group which provides a liaison among the administra\u00ad tion, faculty, Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office, and students. Some of its activities include teaching evaluations, a . Biofaire, special events, publication of a list of 199 courses avail\u00ad able, and a quarterly newsletter. Alpha Epsilon Delta. Alpha Epsilon Delta is a national honor society for students preparing for careers in the health profes\u00ad sions. The objects of the society are to encourage excellence in premedical scholarship; stimulate an appreciation of the impor\u00ad tance of premedical education; promote cooperation and con\u00ad tacts between medical and premedical students and educators; bind together similarly interested students; and use its knowl\u00ad edge for the benefit of health organizations, charities, and the community. In addition to regular meetings, the chapter shows medical films, visits medical centers and health facilities, and sponsors campus and community health service projects. BSSO. The Black Students in Science Organization (BSSO) was established to maintain a unified and supportive community of successful Black science and prehealth professional majors at UCI. The group holds weekly meetings; sponsors guest speak\u00ad ers; provides academic support in the form of study sessions, examinations, and study aids from previous classes; and com\u00ad piles and disseminates information on careers and issues affect\u00ad ing the Black community in particular. BSSO also works in close association with the UCI College of Medicine chapter of the S.N.M.A. (Student National Medical Association). Major achievements have included \"BSSO Week\" and the cosponsor\u00ad ing of an annual \"UCI-CCM Third World Pre-Medical Aware\u00ad ness Conference.\" Medicine/Biological Sci\u00ad ences (CCM/CBS) was established to promote interaction among Chicano- Latino students majoring in the Biological Sciences. Some of the activities include lectures by prominent scientists, opportunities to visit graduate schools, and an annual dance. The major aim of CCM/CBS is to help members attain the goal of their choice-be it medical school, graduate school, or any science-related profession. Medspur. Medspur, conceived in 1977, is dedicated to serving prehealth professional students in both social and academic endeavors while at UCI. As the largest registered campus organ\u00ad ization, Medspur brings together each year well over 400 stu\u00ad dents into the club who are interested in pursuing professional careers in human and animal medicine and in dentistry. Med\u00ad spur's main goal is to bring students together in an environment conducive to the development of cooperation and friendship. Medspur is committed to providing members with the oppor\u00ad tunity to learn about the realities of their prospective careers and the issues which face the heali:h-care specialist. Medspur invites members of the medical community to speak about their professions and consistently organizes studentlfac\u00ad ul~y interactions, dances, MCAT preparation sessions, and Chemistry lA and Biological Sciences 90 examination reviews. The highlight of each year is the annual UCI Medspur/UCLA Medicus joint Southland Pre-Health Conference which allows students to explore all aspects of the health-care professions. Graduate Program The School of Biological Sciences offers graduate study in a wide variety of fields ranging across the spectrum of the biologi\u00ad cal sciences. The four Departments of the School of Biological Sciences (Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolu\u00ad tionary Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Psy\u00ad chobiology) and four Departments of the College of Medicine (Anatomy, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology, and Physiology and Biophysics) cooperate in the conduct of a unified graduate program, administered by the School of Biological Sciences. The organization of the Departments encourages an interdisci\u00ad plinary approach to scientific problems, especially at the gradu\u00ad ate level. All programs of study, regardless of emphasis, lead to the degrees of Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) in the Biological Sciences. At the current time, applica\u00ad tions for the M.A.T. are not being accepted. Each Department has a graduate advisor whom students may consult in regard to the technical details of their individual programs. Applications for admission to graduate study are evaluated both by the Division of Graduate Studies and Research and by the School or the Department to which the student has applied on the basis of letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Exam\u00ad ination scores, grades, and other qualifications of the applicant. Candidates for graduate admission are urged to consult the department(s) whose faculty and expertise best fit their interests. Some faculty are members of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. These faculty are from the De\u00ad partment of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences; the Departments of Developmental and Cell Biology and Molecular BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 75 Biology and Biochemistry in the School of Biological Sciences; and the Department of Physiology and Biophysics in the Col\u00ad lege of Medicine. This program provides an opportunity for interaction among graduate students and faculty who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Par\u00ad ticipating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together monthly to dis\u00ad cuss research problems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdisciplinary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide formal instruction in areas encompassed by biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in the Biological Sciences While both the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy programs are offered, emphasis at the graduate level is on the Ph.D. programs. Most training takes place within one of the departments, although full facilities and curricular offerings are available to all graduate students in all departments of the bio\u00ad logical sciences. Interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Students are expected to maintain a B average at all times, attain the Master's degree in two years, and attain the Ph.D. in four or five years, depending on departmental affiliation. A Master's degree, however, is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree. Each new student is assigned a faculty member as a temporary advisor. During the first part of the initial year of graduate work, the student plans an academic program in consultation with the graduate advisor or a small committee. Faculty advisors are changed if the specific interests of the student change. Stu\u00ad dents are encouraged to consult with other faculty members with regard to their research and academic interests. During their graduate training all students will serve some time as teacher apprentices under the direction of advanced teaching assistants and faculty. Advanced graduate students may work closely with faculty in the planning and execution of the teach\u00ad ing program. The amount and exact nature of the teaching expe\u00ad rience varies with the department. Master of Science Plan 1: Thesis Plan -The student completes seven upper\u00ad division or graduate courses including a minimum of five non\u00ad research courses. The student then presents a thesis based upon research done while in the School. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan-The student completes a minimum of nine upper-division and graduate courses. At least six must be graduate courses (numbered 200- 299) in the student's field specialization. This program is termi\u00ad nated with a comprehensive final examination. Doctor of Philosophy First Level of Competence -The student attains this level by completing oral or written examinations at the discretion of the department. Second Level of Competence -This level is attained by passing an examination dealing with the student's particular UC IRVINE - 1981-198276 BIOLOOICAL SCIENCES interests. A committee for the purpose of administering this examination is appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Once this examination is completed, the student is advanced to candidacy for the degree and is considered to have formally begun dissertation research. The student submits a dissertation on this research and defends it at an oral examination during the final year of graduate study.

Schneiderman: Developmental biology and insect physiology Grover C. Stephens: Comparative animal physiology The Department of Developmental and Cell Biology is con\u00ad cerned with the development, physiology, structure, and func\u00ad tion of organisms and their component cells. The main empha\u00ad sis of the Developmental and Cell Biology graduate program is research training in either developmental and cell biology or comparative physiology of animals and plants. The Department maintains facilities for research involving biochemistry; genetics; electron microscopy; cell, tissue, and organism culture; micro\u00ad surgery; and neurophysiology. Students in the Department of Developmental and Cell Biology generally enter one of two graduate curricula. In the first year, those emphasizing comparative physiology take a three-quarter sequence of organismic physiology (Developmental and Cell Biology 210). Those emphasizing developmental and cell biol\u00ad ogy take a series of courses (five out of a possible eight) in the first two years. The selection of the first-year course program is made in consultation with a faculry advisory committee when the student first arrives on the campus. This committee moni\u00ad tors the student's progress through the first year after which the student's thesis committee is established and takes over the advising function. Students are able to diverge from this basic Core into their areas of special interest by means of graduate seminar courses in subsequent\" years. At the end of the first year students in comparative physiology take an oral examination that covers a broad area in the general and related fields of interest to that student. Students in developmental and cell biology prepare and defend a research propo~al and are exam\u00ad ined in fields related to the proposal. Since many doctoral stu\u00ad dents in the Department undertake academic careers, the Department expects each graduate student to participate in a directed teaching experience during the graduate program. Stu\u00ad dents who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D degree within five years or less. Some faculty from the Department are members of an interdis\u00ad ciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. See page 75 for a description of the program.

Runde!: Physiological plant ecology John T. Smiley: Plant-insect interactions Grover C. Stephens: Comparative animal physiology Ecology and evolutionary biology deals with the establishment of adaptations\u00b7 over evolutionary time and with the significance of these adaptations in ecological time. The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology focuses on problems at the population and community levels, with particular emphasis placed on coevolved processes. While the Department has faculty specialists in plant and animal ecology and in marine and terrestrial ecology, primary attention is given to important eco\u00ad logical questions rather than to particular habitats or taxa. Faculty and graduate student research is often centered at the interface of two or more of these specialties. Departmental research activities include ecological energetics, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator interactions, population and reproductive ecology, and community ecology. These research endeavors attempt to achieve a balance between empirical and theoretical approaches\u00b7 to evolutionary and ecological problems. Primary emphasis in the Department graduate program is placed on training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences; under exceptional circumstances, a student may be admitted initially to the M.S. program. All entering students are required to enroll during the first year in a two-quarter graduate core sequence. At the end of the first year, these students will com\u00ad plete an oral examination based upon the core courses and other materials the Department might require. Satisfactory per\u00ad formance on this examination is required for continuation in the graduate program. Students entering with a B.A. or B.S. degree will enroll in the graduate core for two consecutive years, while those entering with an M.A. or M.S. degree will enroll only for the initial year. Each entering graduate student will be assigned a faculty advisor and a three-person advisory committee for guidance, with whom the student will meet at least once each quarter. All stu\u00ad dents are encouraged to submit a research proposal to their advisory committee during .their first year of residency. A com\u00ad prehensive proposal is required before the end of the second year. The progress of each student is reviewed by the depart\u00ad mental faculty before the end of each academic year. ECOLOGY AND EVOLunONARY BIOLOGY 83 Normally, all requirements for the Ph.D. should be completed within five years. No more than seven years will be allowed for completion of the program. Prior to advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., students must satisfy two breadth requirements at the discretion of their advisory committee. One of these must be satisfied with a foreign language and the second by the attainment of an additional skill equivalent to a second foreign language (i.e., a second foreign language, demonstrated skills in computer-statistics, attainment of unusual technical expertise necessary for dissertation research, etc.) Advancement to doc\u00ad toral candidacy by a comprehensive oral examination will be expected during the third year for students entering with a B.A. or B.S. or during the second year for those entering with an M.A. or M.S. Applicants for this program should have a solid undergraduate program in biology and ecology, emphasizing both research and field work. In addition, course work in statis\u00ad tics, mathematics, and physical and chemical sciences is expected. All applicants are required to submit verbal, quanti\u00ad tative, and advanced biology GRE scores. The deadline for application is February 1.

Noble: Human behavior Jon F. Sassin: Sleep disorders Arnold Starr: Neural bases of sensory process, evoked brain potentials Norman M. Weinberger: Neural bases of attention and learning Pauline I. Yahr: Hormonal control of social behavior Psychobiology is concerned with the biology of the nervous sys\u00ad tem and behavior. The Department of Psychobiology empha\u00ad sizes the adaptive aspects of neural and behavioral plasticity. The faculty's research interests include the biochemical, endo\u00ad crinological, genetic, and experiential determinants of nervous system function and behavior. Focal topics include synaptic processes, neurophysiology, neuroendocrinology, neuroanat\u00ad omy, neuropharmacology, arousal and attention, learning. and memory, reproductive behavior, and communication. The importance of a developmental and comparative approach to these problems is stressed. The Department of Psychobiology offers graduate training lead\u00ad ing to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences. Graduate students must complete a sequence of core courses (lectures and laboratories) during their first and second years. They also must take a min\u00ad imum of four advanced courses before graduation and must participate in directed research and teaching each year. To advance\u00b7 to candidacy, the student must prepare a critical review paper in the area of the proposed dissertation research and must pass a!\"! oral examination in psychobiology by the end of the third year. Graduation depends on successful preparation and oral defense of a dissertation based on the student's research. Students are expected to complete this program in four years of study. Ideally, applicants for this program should have taken under\u00ad graduate courses in biology (one introductory year plus some advanced work), psychology (experimental, physiological, and learning), chemistry through biochemistry, introductory phys\u00ad ics, calculus, and statistics. They also must submit general apti\u00ad tude GRE test scores. Because graduate training emphasizes research, preference is given to applicants having laboratory research experience as undergraduates. The Department accepts only those students seeking a doctorate, though students who do not successfully complete their course work or do not advance to candidacy may, with the consent of the faculty, complete a Master's thesis and receive an M.S. degree in Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences. Applicants with substantial outside commitments that would curtail laboratory research or prolong the time to degree are not accepted. Students are encouraged to take the GRE no later than October.

Swett, Department Chair: Sensory-motor systems of the spinal cord Lyle C. Dearden, Vice Chair: Growth inhibition and pulmonary edema interactions visual system Herbert P. Killackey: system sensory systems; forebrain organization Raymond B. Wuerker: Neuropathology The Department of Anatomy in the College of Medicine offers a doctoral program leading to the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, with specialized research training in the neurosciences. Research programs in the neurosciences include neurotransmit\u00ad ter immunocytochemistry, the central neural regulation of circa\u00ad dian rhythms, forebrain organization, and organization and development of sensory systems. Research programs also . include growth inhibition, cartilage, and pulmonary edema. The Department maintains research facilities so that the student can become experienced with the following neuroscientific data. Stu\u00ad dents are encouraged to become proficient in multiple areas of study using numerous techniq~es in various species. UC IRVINE - 1981-198288ANATOMY Students in the Department of Anatomy have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the technical skills, theoretical back\u00ad ground, and experimental knowledge necessary to conduct innovative and fundamentally sound research. The second goal is to become knowledgeable anatomists with the ability to teach graduate, undergraduate, and professional courses in anatomy and neuroscience. These two goals are achieved through a basic and extended academic program that is tailored to the individ\u00ad ual needs of the student. The core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of gross, cellular, and subcellular anat\u00ad omy; physiology; and biochemistry. In the first year, students will be required to take neuroanatomy, microscopic anatomy, embryology, gross anatomy, biochemistry, and physiology. Over the usual four-year training period the student will be required to complete a practical course in statistics, four departmental seminar courses, four laboratory tutorials, and a total of 50 credit hours of research in anatomy. Elective courses in the Department of Anatomy or other departments on campus may also be taken; examples include pharmacology, psychobiology, cell biology, genetics, computer science, pathology, and physiol\u00ad ogy. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to tak\u00ad ing electives. Only a minimum of the third year is spent taking courses. Each year following the first year, the student is expected to act as an assistant in one major anatomy core course. When a student is accepted into the graduate program, the stu\u00ad dent and the Graduate Committee decide to which laboratories the student will be assigned the first year. During the first year the student will spend approximately 25 percent of the time doing research. At the beginning of the second year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the dissertation research. An oral Qualifying Examina\u00ad tion at the end of the summer of the second year is given to the student by a Candidacy Committee. The examination covers anatomy and focuses on the candidate's field of specialization. The dissertation research is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Graduate Committee. The major\u00ad ity of the second, third, and fourth year is devoted to complet\u00ad ing the research and preparing a written dissertation suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the student's advisor and Doctoral Committee constitutes the final examina\u00ad tion. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded follow\u00ad ing completion of all the requirements, a process that normally will take four years to complete.

Wilson: Mechanics of respiration; gas exchange and pathophysiology of asthma; site of deposition of aerosols; physio\u00ad logical properties of hypometabolic status (transcendental meditation) Graduate instruction and research in physiology and biophysics leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences is offered by the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, College of Medicine. The Department provides research opportunities in the molecu\u00ad lar biophysics of membranes and proteins, endocrinology, cellu\u00ad lar physiology, and the physiology of exercise, respiration, and the nervous system. The faculty research is generally oriented toward molecular and cellular physiology but opportunities for research in organ physiology also exist. The core curriculum provides the student with a broad background in physiology and biophysics and the closely related fields of anatomy and biochemistry. Elective courses permit in-depth exploration of particular areas. Interdisciplinary dissertation research involving the research of more than one faculty member is encouraged. Prerequisites for admission normally include a bachelor's degree in one of the biological sciences, physics, chemistry, mathe\u00ad matics, or engineering, as well as undergraduate courses in cal\u00ad culus, organic and physical chemistry, biochemistry, and ad\u00ad vanced biology (e.g., neurophysiology, cell biology, neurobiol\u00ad ogy, psychobiology). Up to two prerequisites may be fulfilled as first-year electives. ORE Aptitude and Advanced tests are required. Preference will be given to those students who have prior research experience. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982The Department admits about three highly qualified students each fall. The program emphasizes original research, and stu\u00ad dents are expected to become involved in the research of the Department as early as possible. The core program includes graduate courses in physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, mor\u00ad phology, and cell biology. After the first year, training will fol\u00ad low the classical tutorial pattern in which a small nu~ber of students are tutored by the faculty in an informal setting. Stu\u00ad dents also will participate in a program of laboratory rotations and attend the weekly colloquium in physiology. The third and fourth years will be spent primarily in research, with some par\u00ad ticipation in teaching physiology to medical students. Each stu\u00ad dent must submit a written dissertation on an original research project and successfully defend this dissertation in an oral examination. Incoming students will receive academic advising from the Department Graduate Advisor until such time as they choose a dissertation advisor. The faculty conducts quarterly reviews of all continuing students to ensure that they are maintaining satis\u00ad factory progress within their particular academic program. Stu\u00ad dents who have completed all necessary prerequisites should be able to complete the Ph.D. within four years. A comprehensive examination will be administered in June at the end of the second year. The examination is based upon the tutorials in advanced physiology and is designed to test the stu\u00ad dent's ability to organize a body of knowledge and to think criti\u00ad cally. Some time during the third year, the student will present a seminar on a topic assigned by the formal candidacy committee. Following the seminar, the committee will critically examine the student's qualifications for the successful conduct of the doc\u00ad toral dissertation. Advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. is recommended to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon the unanimous vote of the committee. Some faculty from the Department are members of an interdis\u00ad ciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. See page 75 for a description of the program.

UC IRVINE - 1981-198292 FINE ARTS r---\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 SCHOOL OF FINE ARTS Clayton Garrison Dean \"'\u00b7--\u00b7- .... ----- The primary activity of the School of Fine Arts is creating and performing works of art in an atmosphere in\u00b7 which the creative process is central. We are committed to the creative act: to making and performing. A program based on such a commit\u00ad ment requires a faculty experienced in the creative process. The faculty in the School of Fine Arts is comprised primarily of permanent artists-in-residence. Studio courses in all areas are taught by eminent facultY who have earned their living profes\u00ad sionally and who continue to maintain professional assignments and commitments. In addition to the permanent artists-in-residence faculty, visiting artists comprise about one-third of the staff, providing a con\u00ad stant inflow of ideas and personalities. A variety of artists chal\u00ad lenges the students' sensibilities and encourages them to think and to create freshly and freely. The focus on the creative process, the professional and scholar\u00ad performer faculty, and the individual's commirment and cour\u00ad age provide, we feel, an ideal condition for the serious student UC IRVINE - 1981-1982in the arts who wants to be painting, sculpturing, dancing, act\u00ad ing, singing, directing, choreographing, writing, or playing an instrument six to 10 hours a day during the most sensitive and formative years of life. Our central concern is the development of a creative talent in an armosphere of creative activity. In addi\u00ad tion to programs concerned primarily with studio and perfor\u00ad mance activity, courses of study in the history and theory of the arts are offered as major areas of concentration. Undergraduate majors are offered in Fine Arts (General Inter\u00ad disciplinary), History of Art, Studio Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. Requirements include extensive studio and workshop experiences, essential theoretical and historical backgrounds, and exercises in criticism. The requirements for all performing and studio majors in the fine arts are designed to provide opportunities for the student-artist to work creatively for at least four hours a day from the freshman year through gradua\u00ad tion. Courses in film writing and television are available in the Drama program. A student who wishes to pursue a double major by combining rwo majors from the School of Fine Arts or by combining a major from the School with a major from another academic unit may do so with the proviso that only one major can be officially declared until the senior year. At that time, when the requirements for both majors are nearly completed, the student can be approved as a double major. In addition to producing student concerts, musicals, and dra\u00ad matic performances, the School of Fine Arts presents a varied offering of cultural events each year, including distinguished lecturers, world-renowned concert artists, outstanding dance and drama groups, jazz and folk performers, a film series, and a gallery program. The Fine Arts Village includes studio and classroom space for the areas of studio art, art history, dance, drama, and music. Specialized facilities for the studio art area include an Art Gallery and six well-lighted studios for drawing, painting, sculp\u00ad ture, graphics, and ceramics. Power equipment for sculpture, two presses for graphics (intaglio), print making and lithog\u00ad raphy, and rwo kilns for ceramics are available. The Village Theatre, conventionally designed, contains an orchestra pit, a large, completely equipped stage, and seating for 420 people. The Concert Hall, seating 230, has a thrust platform stage, a Baroque pipe organ, and excellent acoustics. The Studio Theatre provides an experimental stage base without fixed seats, allow\u00ad ing complete freedom in determining the style of production. The Little Theatre, located in Humanities Hall, and the Virginia and Norman Nixon Studio Theatre are intimate proscenium theatres for Drama Workshops and graduate directing projects. All theatres are completely equipped with modern sound and lighting systems, and students involved in productions work in completely equipped and professionally operated scenery and costume shops. Campus television studios are also located in the Village. Music students attend orchestra rehearsals in a spe\u00ad cial Village facility also utilized for choral and instrumental ensemble rehearsals. Practice rooms are equipped with Steinway practice pianos, and Steinway concert grands are used in con\u00ad certs. A music listening laboratory is also available to music students. Dance classes in ballet, freestyle, and jazz are held in four locations: the rwo main studios in the Fine Arts Village, Crawford Hall (gymnasium), and the Studio Theatre. FINEARTS93 The School of Fine Arts is organized with areas of instruction and production, rather than with formal deparrments. The faculty in each of the major areas of instruction (art history, studio art, dance, drama, music) nominates five students to the Dean's Student Advisory Council. The Dean selects rwo under\u00ad graduates and one graduate student from each area. These 15 students comprise the Dean's Student Advisory Council for a term of one year. The Council meets about six times a year. This council reviews matters concerning appointments and promotions, curriculum, appropriations, policy on graduate admissions, productions and concerts, and community rela\u00ad tions. There is no difference berween undergraduate and gradu\u00ad ate participation. The students act as an ad hoc review commit\u00ad tee on all permanent appointments and on all recommendations for merit increases and promotions. Students in the School'of Fine Arts and qualified students from other academic areas are involved at a less formal level as participants, organizers, and coordinators throughout the year in the various productional units, including University Chorus, UCI Symphony Orchestra, University Theatre, Student Exhibitions, Graduate Art Gallery, Dance Concerts, Dance Workshop, Drama Workshop, Music and Opera Workshop, and Television Production. The opportunity is provided for. all qualified UCI students to participate in the UCI Pep Band \u00b7and Song Leaders, and to receive course credit for this participation. Those interested should see the instructor of Theatre Orchestra, Drama 173, about requirements for participation and enrollment in the appropriate course. All new Fine Arts students are assigned or may choose their own faculty advisors and are encouraged to meet with them dur\u00ad ing orientation week and periodically throughout the year to plan programs of study and to discuss educational and career ob\u00ad jectives. In addition, students are invited to make use of the counseling services in the Fine Arts Counseling Office for assis\u00ad tance with programs, requirements, or any academic matter.

School Requirements: None (see under programs). Graduate Program The School of Fine Arts offers a program leading to the degree of Master of Fine Arts with concentrations in studio art, dance, drama, and music. The primary activity of the School of Fine UC IRVINE - 1981-198294 FINE ARlSIHISTORY OF ART Arts is performance-the creative act. Research activities are concerned with illuminating performance and inspiring the stu\u00ad dio experience. The intellectual activity of theoretical, literary, and historical courses complements the practical work in studio workshops and performance. The aim of the program is, thus, to produce literate artists who are responsive to intellectual stim\u00ad uli, who are capable of integrating knowledge into creative acts, and who are disciplined to the point of freedom. It is the strong belief of the School that intellectual integrity and professional excellence cannot exist without each other. Admission to the Program Applications are accepted for fall quarter admission only, and ordinarily must be completed by March 1 as the number of graduate students that can be admitted to the School of Fine Arts is limited. Applicants are advised to arrange for submission of portfolios, auditions, compositions, dossiers, and interviews, as appropriate, by March 1. Students applying for scholarships and fellowships should do so by March 1, and are also encour\u00ad aged to apply for financial assistance through the Financial Aid Office. The School of Fine Arts has a modest number of teach\u00ad ing assistantships available in all areas, and all candidates are automatically reviewed for teaching assistantship positions; the \u00b7School informs successful candidates by June 1 for the follow\u00ad ing academic year. Upon admission to the program the student will be assigned an advisor. The student should discuss with this advisor the scope of undergraduate preparation to determine any areas which may need strengthening if the student is to derive full benefit from graduate study. FINE ARTS General Interdisciplinary The program in general interdisciplinary studies is designed for students who wish to combine the various disciplines in fine arts. Although participation in studio classes is required, the program emphasizes the study of the history, theory, and criti\u00ad cism of the arts in three of the School's instructional areas. The nature of the program provides each student the opportunity to plan a uniquely individual course of study with the approval of an advisor. Upon completion of this program, students will be awarded the B.A. in Fine Arts with General Interdisciplinary as the area of concentration. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: None.

The curriculum constantly relates stu\u00b7 dio practice to the development of the visual arts and current critical theory. It aims to develop a sense of visual awareness by as wide a range of the study of art as possible. The student majoring in art experiences the creative aspects of art by learn\u00ad ing to think with the materials and techniques of the medium.

Sample Program for Freshmen Fall Winter Art Studio 30A Art Studio 30B Art History 40A Art History 40B Elective Elective Elective Elective Spring Art Studio 30C Art History 40C Elective Elective Master of Fine Arts Program Degree Offered M.F.A. in Fine Arts, with emphasis in studio art. General Information The M.F.A. program focuses primarily on-development of experimental concepts and format relevant to contemporary issues as they affect visual arts, rather than on processes of tra\u00ad ditional techniques and ideas. A small, personal environment supports the individual's efforts in research, development, and exhibition of ideas by providing as much latitude for special needs as possible. By meeting with students on a one-to-one basis or in small groups, a variety of art experiences occur. Internships, selected field trips, contemporary exhibitions in the Art Gallery, contact with visiting professional artists, and seminars provide the framework for the program. Because of the limited physical facilities, studio space is arranged privately. Admission Applicants for admission to the degree program must meet the general requirements for admission to graduate study, hold a B.A. or B.F.A. in Art, and submit by March 1 a portfolio of their creative work. Normally, anyone who has earned an M.F.A. degree in Studio Art will not be considered for admis\u00ad sion into the program. General Degree Requirements Normally two years of residence are required. Each candidate must enroll for three courses each quarter for six quarters, exclusive of summer sessions. The student's progress and body of work will be reviewed by a faculty committee, normally after three quarters in residence. A satisfactory opinion by this committee will allow the student to progress to candidacy for the degree. Satisfactory attainment must be demonstrated by a specific crea\u00ad tive project. This project is to be supported by a thesis incor\u00ad porating visual and written material relevant to the project and the candidate's creative research while at UCI. Oral defense of the project and essay may be required to test the candidate's general knowledge in the area in which the project falls. Specific Degree Requirements Seventy-two quarter units in graduate or approved upper\u00ad division undergraduate courses must be completed with a grade of at least Bjn each course. Not more than 20 units in upper\u00ad division courses may count toward the degree. Electives may be taken in any discipline. The 72 units will normally be made up in the following manner: First Year: three courses in Graduate Problems (215); three seminars in Problems of Contemporary Art (230); three courses in Graduate Projects (240). Second Year: two courses in Graduate Problems (215); three seminars in Problems of Contemporary Art (230); three courses in Graduate Projects (240); one course in Thesis (260).

University of California, Irvine, Chair and Asso\u00ad ciate Professor of Dance (modern dance technique; dance notation; choreography; movement analysis) El Gabriel, Lecturer in Dance (ballet; modern dance technique; choreog\u00ad raphy; choreography workshop) Wendy Hilton, Wendy Hilton Baroque Visiting Lee\u00ad curer in Dance (drama; music/historical choreography; Baroque dance) Eugene Loring, Professor Emeritus of Dance Olga Maynard, Associate Professor of Dance (dance history, aesthetics, and criticism) Carol McGahan, Visiting Lecturer in Dance (ballet technique) Janice Gudde Plastina, Ph.D. University of Southern California, Asso\u00ad (ballet; modern dance technique; theories of dance; research methods; choreography) Barbara Visiting Lecturer in Dance (ballet; modern dance tech- nique; teaching of dance) Antony Tudor, Associate Director, American Ballet Theatre, Visiting Lecturer in Dance The program in dance provides studio experiences in the fun\u00ad damental knowledge and techniques of classical ballet and of contemporary dance movements. The classical academic approach to ballet adheres to those principles developed from Noverre through Petipa and Cecchetti modified to accommo\u00ad date our current understanding of those laws of physics and of the human anatomy applicable to the study of dance. The workshops in contemporary dance explore and extend the vari\u00ad ous apprbaches to modern dance and jazz, concentrating on DANCE97 physiological and rhythmic problems encountered in contem\u00ad porary choreography. Studies in preclassic dance forms and their musical structures provide additional workshop experience as well as significant research materials for choreographic prob\u00ad lems. Theoretical and historical courses complement the practi\u00b7 cal work in workshops, choreography, and performance. The program is designed for students preparing to continue profes\u00ad sionally as dancers, as choreographers, and as teachers, as well as for students who, while not planning to make dance their vocation, have a serious interest in the theory, practice, and his\u00ad tory of dance. The traditional technique of classical ballet constitutes a craft and style that serves not only as a physiological center for the logical training of the body, but also as a basic language of movement for the choreographer. Workshop experiences build progressively on the techniques of ballet and extend through the contemporary idioms of jazz, modern, and freestyle. The aim is to develop kinetic resources, precision, flexibility, and freedom in a coordinated and intelligently responsive body. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: None. Performance Requirements Students planning to major in dance should develop basic abil\u00ad ity in techniques of ballet and freestyle dance forms. Although freshmen entering with fewer than 12 units are not required to audition, a placement examination is offered. The evaluation of the examination indicates the level of ballet and freestyle at which the student is placed. Freshmen declaring the dance major are encouraged to take the placement examination, espe\u00ad cially if they feel they could be placed at a higher level than Ballet I and Freestyle I. At the end of the sophomore year, the faculty will determine whether the student is making sufficient progress to proceed as an upper-division major. All advanced standing applicants (entering students with 12 units or more) to the University who have indicated an interest in majoring in dance are required to audition and will be noti\u00ad fied by the School of the date. Evaluations of the student's audi\u00ad tion will indicate whether or not the student may major in dance and will indicate the appropriate placement level in ballet and freestyle for students admitted to the major. This placement level determines the minimum amount of years it will take to complete the degree requirements. Inasmuch as the level of performance ability generally deter\u00ad mines the length of time in study, and all transfer students must anticipate meeting the total performance requirements for the B.A. degree, students deficient in level of performance in com\u00ad parison to their level of academic study should be prepared to extend their studies in order to meet performance requirements. Program Requirements Performing Major: four years studio work in ballet (Dance 30A-B-C, 35A-B-C, 130A-B-C, 135A-B-C); three years studio work in freestyle (Dance 40A-B-C, 45A-B-C, and 140 for three quarters); two years studio work in jazz (Dance SOA-B-C, 55 A\u00ad B-C); one year in theory (Dance 20A-B-C); one quarter in fun\u00ad damentals of music (Music 25) and two quarters in music for UC IRVINE - 1981-198298DANCE dancers (Dance 120A-B); one course in dance notation (Dance 65A); three consecutive courses in history of dance (Dance 110A-B-C or 112A-B-C); three courses in choreography (Dance 155A-B-C); two courses in acting (Drama 30A-B); par\u00ad ticipation in dance performance (Dance 160).

University of Texas, Austin, Assistant Professor in Drama The program leading to the Bachelor of Arts in Drama provides the professional training and the liberal study essential to attain\u00ad ing the highest standards in theatre. Each major in drama expe\u00ad riences exacting and rigorous training in the mutually interre\u00ad lated areas of the theatre: performance, design, literature, his\u00ad tory, and criticism. The curriculum constantly relates studio practices, technical resources, and productional techniques to the development of dramatic literature and current critical the\u00ad ory. The student specializes during the last two years of study in acting, directing, design, television, or criticism. Majors in drama are expected to undertake extensive studies in art, dance, and music. The continuous production of plays, musicals, operettas, and operas constitutes the major activity of the program. Students are treated as members of a theatrical organization, and they acquire experiences in all phases of theatrical production in a professionally disciplined atmosphere. Dramatic production centers on an exhaustive analysis of the script and on the chal\u00ad lenge of communicating the complexities of the plan to an audience in a unified and meaningful production. The program is designed for students preparing to continue professionally as actors, directors, designers, critics, and teachers, as well as for students who, while not planning to make the theatre their vocation, have a serious interest in the literature, theory, and practice of drama. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: None. Program Requirements One year survey in the development of dramatic literature (Drama 40A-B-C); one year in acting (Drama 30A-B-C); three courses in design (Drama SOA-B-C); one course in makeup (Drama 153 ); an introductory course in production theory (Drama 10); two upper-division courses in dramatic literature; six upper-division courses in addition to the two in dramatic literature mentioned above (these may be in studio work and/ or dramatic literature, playwriting, film writing, television production, and criticism); two quarters in dance (these courses may be taken on Pass/Not Pass); two quarters of Theatre Pro\u00ad duction (Drama 101).

During the second year of the program the candidate will be examined on general familiarity with the history of the theatre and the principal works of dramatic literature. An assigned list of books and plays will form the basic syllabus of this examination.

The program for the Bachelor's degree in Music is designed for two types of students: those who wish to obtain a sound back\u00ad ground in music leading to a terminal degree and those who wish to obtain a thorough preparation for undertaking graduate work in one or more of four broad fields: musicology, composi\u00ad tion, music performance, and teaching. The program provides intensive training in three mutually dependent areas as related components of a total musical experience: performance and musicianship, the theory of music, and the history of music. A knowledge of all three of these areas is indispensable and min\u00ad imal for a successful career in music. The program in music provides practical and theoretical studies fundamental to a wide spectrum of careers in music. The aim of this program is to give a sound basic musical education for students wishing to fulfill themselves either as performers, scholars, or teachers, as well as in other musical pursuits. A special option is available to fulfill the needs of those students whose primary interest is in the area of string performance. I Beyond the specific goals outlined above and the requirements listed below, the student in music, through cooperative pro\u00ad grams undertaken in conjunction with the other arts, achieves an awareness of the relationship of music to those other arts and of the various roles of music in society, both past and present. Several music scholarships are available. These include, but are not restricted to, the Hinkle-Phillips Memorial Scholarship ($1,000), the Harry and Marjorie Anne Slim Memorial Scho\u00ad larships ($1,000), the Music Section of the Town and Gown Scholarships, and the Zubin Mehta Scholarship given by the Orange County Philharmonic Society ($500).

Lillyman Dean The School of Humanities s~ts for itself the goal of helping to develop both the analytical and creative powers of its students HUMANITIES 109 with particular respect not only to vocational goals, but also the larger questions of human conduct, the modes of human com\u00ad munication and symbolization, speculative thought, and the verbal arts. The School includes those basic disciplines of lan\u00ad guage, literature, history, and philosophy that deal fundamen\u00ad tally with the relation of man to himself and to all that is other than himself. As such, the School takes as its concern a large portion of the liberal education not only of students who intend UC IRVINE - 1981-1982110 HUMANITIES to major within its confines, but also of students who come to it from other parts of the campus. Because of the nature of the disciplines collected in the School, it is deeply concerned with language and its many facets. Further, though the School has established a number of specific major courses of study, it is intent on integrating the basic disciplines in a variety of ways at the undergraduate level and to some extent at the graduate level.

B.A., M.A.T., M.A., Ph.D. Honors Students are nominated for honors at graduation on the basis of scholarship and special achievements. To be nominated the stu\u00ad dent must achieve a UC grade point average of at least 3.40 and receive strong recommendation from the department. A min\u00ad imum of 18 courses (72 units) in residence at UCI is a neces\u00ad sary condition for honors at graduation. To be eligible for nom\u00ad ination, the student must meet all honors criteria and must file an application for graduation by the end of the winter quarter of the senior year. Undergraduate Programs The School offers undergraduate majors in Classical Civiliza\u00ad tion, Classics, Comparative Literature, English, French, Ger\u00ad man, History, Humanities, Linguistics, Philosophy, Russian, and Spanish. It offers elementary and intermediate courses in Hebrew and elementary and upper-division courses in Italian and Portuguese. A corps of lower-division advisors is designed to meet the spe\u00ad cial needs of freshmen and sophomores. The advisors are par\u00ad ticularly interested in undergraduate education and especially knowledgeable about University regulations, requirements in and outside the School, course content, options to major, and other matters that may present difficulties. Students in the School do not elect majors until the last quarter of the sopho\u00ad more year, at which time each student is assigned an advisor in the major chosen. Until that time the lower-division advisor is prepared to help the student keep options to major open, plan a coherent program of humanistic study, and reach an eventual decision about the major. - NOTE: In many undergraduate courses in the School of Humanities, additional meetings berween individual students and the instructor may be required. Generally each major stipulates a one-year course that is both an introduction to the discipline and a prerequisite to the major itself. Students who plan wisely with their advisors will con\u00ad struct p~ograms that include a good number of such courses. Undergraduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on committees of various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the Humanities Council, which directly advises the Dean. Graduates of the School of Humanities often go on to graduate and professional schools. An undergraduate major in the humanities is excellent preparation for future careers in law, teaching at all levels, business, journalism, administration, government service at all levels, and even medicine. Language Laboratory The Language Laboratory serves as the audio-lingual resource center for the following languages taught in the School of Humanities: Spanish, French, German, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, and Hebrew. Students, faculty, and staff may listen to cassettes of audio material in the Laboratory, or they may check out cassettes and cassette players to practice at home. Members of the community are welcome to use the Language Laboratory facilities on campus. In addition to the languages offered in the School of Humani\u00ad ties, the Language Laboratory has a tape library that includes reels in Persian, Romanian, Chinese, Japanese, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, English, and Swahili. Arrangements can be made to provide these languages on cassette. Through the business office, the Language Laboratory operates a translation referral service for students, faculry, staff, members of the community, and local businesses. The Language Labora\u00ad tory is located in 207 and 213 Humanities Hall and is open from 8:00 a.m. until4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The telephone number is (714) 833-6344. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements Humanities 1A-B-C, taken in the freshman year (transfer stu\u00ad dents may substitute appropriate course work in composition, literature, history, humanities, and philosophy for the Core Course by permission: apply in the Dean's Office); rwo years of work in a single acceptable foreign language, either modern or classical (through 2C), or equivalent competence; quarterly consultation with an assigned lower-division advisor and the advisor's written approval for the program of study decided upon. Consultation should be made by the second week of each quarter. Graduate Programs The School offers a wide program of graduate degrees. Although the Master's degree is offered in most departments, the programs emphasize the Ph.D. and give distinct preference in admission to those students who intend to take that degree. An exception is the rwo-year Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing). In addition to the seminars offered by the various departments, the School sponsors a number of interdis\u00ad ciplinary seminars annually. These courses are taught jointly by faculty members from various departments. Further, several departments offer a few students the opportunity to do part of their work for the Ph.D. in a related discipline. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982A limited number of students is accepted annually to study for teaching credentials. This program is a cooperative effort between the School and the Office of Teacher Education. Graduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on committees of the various departtnents, by sirting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the student graduate advisory committee, which directly advises the Dean. DEPARTMENT OF CLASSICS B.P. Reardon, D.U. Universite de Nantes, Chair of the Department and Professor of Classics (Late Greek literature; Greek novel) Luci Berkowitz, Ph.D.The Ohio State University, Professor of Classics (Greek bibliography; literary criticism) Theodore F. Brunner, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Classics and Director, Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project (computer applica\u00ad tion to classical literature; Augustan literature) Peter Colaclides, of Athens, Professor of Classics (lin\u00ad guistics; politics; criticism) Richard I. Frank, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Associate Professor of Classics and History (Roman history; Classical tradition) Dana F. Sutton, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Assistant Professor of Classics (Greek drama, satyr-play) \u00b7 Undergraduate Program The Departtnent of Classics aims to provide the undergraduate student with an exposure to the origins and heritage of Western civilization. The Departtnent is committed to a twofold pur\u00ad pose: ( 1) disseminating interest in and knowledge of classical civilization through the teaching of Greek and Latin language and literature; and (2), through English translation courses in classical literature, history, civilization, and mythology, helping students to appreciate the pervasive influence of Greece and Rome on our own civilization. The Department offers both a major in Classics with an emphasis on Greek, Latin, or Linguis\u00ad tics and a major in Classical Civilization in which most of the required courses are in English translation. Students are encour\u00ad aged to consult with the Classics faculty regar:ding the appro\u00ad priate choice of major and design of program. For the Classics major, the basis of studying the Classics must be competence in both of the classical languages. The Classics program is designed to provide the student with this compe\u00ad tence as rapidly as possible, so that by the end of first year Latin or Greek the student has already been introduced to some of the major classical authors in the original. From then on, the student is concerned with reading and interpreting the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and will devote study to literary and textual criticism. In addition, students obtain an extensive background in ancillary fields such as ancient history, archaeology, art, drama, philosophy, and religion. The major in Classical Civilization is designed for those students who have no plans to pursue graduate studies in the classical languages, yet wish to obtain an undergraduate degree based on a sound exposure to the classical world. The nucleus of this major consists of one year of study (or its equivalent) in either classical language and a minimum of 10 courses in English translation (seven of which are given by the Department) con\u00ad cerning such topics as classical literature, civilization, history, archaeology, art, and drama. .. ClASSICS 111 The student planning to major in Classics or Classical Civiliza\u00ad tion should obtain a copy of the pamphlet, \"The Classics,\" available in the departtnental office. Students entering UCI with previous Greek or Latin training will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Latin will enroll in Latin lB, lC, 25, and 100 respec\u00ad tively. Exceptions to this ruling can be made but must have the \u00b7 approval of the Departtnent Chair. Students with high school training in the classical languages are encouraged to consult with the Classics staff before enrolling in Classics courses. \u00b7 The Departtnent adheres to the policy of giving its students an opportunity to participate in the departmental decision-making process. Student representatives, elected from and by the undergraduate majors, participate in all departmental meetings. They are responsible for maintaining close liaison with their . constituency, for representing the students' interest in curricu\u00ad lum and personnel matters, and for the evaluation of both the academic program and the academic staff. Please direct inquiries regarding language placement, prerequi\u00ad sites, planning a program of study, or other matters related to the Department's offerings to the Office of the Chair, 142 Humanities Hall, (714) 833-6735/5896. Hebrew and Judaic Studies Courses in Hebrew and Judaic Studies were initiated by the Department of Classics in September 1976, through a joint agreement between the School of Humanities and the Univer\u00ad sity of Judaism in Los Angeles. Under the auspices of this agreement, students may take two years of the Hebrew lan\u00ad guage. The courses cover both contemporary and biblical Hebrew. In addition, it is intended that a course will be offered each quarter in either Jewish history, philosophy, or literature. Through this program the Department of Classics is able to broaden its offerings to include both the Greek and Hebrew contributions to Western civilization. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: See page 110. Departmental Requirements Two separate majors: Classics (with an emphasis in Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and Classical Civilization. Classics (Greek emphasis): five or more courses on the Greek 100 level; Greek 110; Latin lA-B-C; Latin 25; two courses on the Latin 100 level. Classics (Latin emphasis): five or more courses on the Latin 100 level; Latin 110; Greek 1A-B..C; Greek 25; two courses on the Greek 1 00 level. Classics (Linguistics emphasis): two possible plans of study. Greek concentration-Greek 25; five courses on the Greek 100 level; Greek 110; Latin 25; two courses on the Latin 100 level; Linguistics 50, 110, 120, 130 (Greek 120 recommended) or Latin concentration-Latin 25; five courses on the Latin 100 level; Latin 110; Greek 25; two courses on the Greek 100 level; Linguistics 50, 110, 120, 130 (Latin 120 recommended). UC IRVINE - 1981-1982 112 CLASSICS NOTE: With the permission of the Department, an additional 100 series course in the same language may be substituted for Greek or Latin 25. Classical Civilization: Latin (or Greek) 1A-B-C, or equiva\u00ad lent; Classics 35A-B-C; Classics 50A; at least one course each from the Classics 150, 160, and 170 series; three additional courses in classical history, classical philosophy, classical art or classical civilization approved by the Classics Department. Planning a Program of Study The Department believes in close consultation with students on academic advising, program planning, and discussion of goals and direction. Students planning to major in Classics or Classi\u00ad cal Civilization are strongly urged to consult with the depart\u00ad mental faculty at the earliest possible moment, in order to famil\u00ad iarize themselves with the nature of the various programs. All majors are assigned to a faculty member for academic advising. Career Opportunities The Classics major may lead to a career in high school teaching, or, after appropriate graduate study, in college and university teaching. The major is prepared for admission to graduate study in classics, comparative literature, linguistics, ancient history, or, with additional course work, archaeology. A Classics or Classi\u00ad cal Civilization major is also excellent preparation for entering a theological seminary. However, it is not the essential purpose of a major program in Classics, and especially Classical Civiliza\u00ad tion, to provide specific vocational skills. The study of Greek, Latin, and classical civilization is primarily a valuable com\u00ad ponent of a liberal education. A knowledge of Greek and Roman literature, history, religion, philosophy, and science pro\u00ad vides a proper foundation for the investigation and appreciation of all aspects of modern civilization. Nevertheless, the student who chooses to major in Classics or Classical Civilization has the choice of many professional opportunities. Graduate and professional schools in law, medi\u00ad cine, or business welcome students with training in the Classics. In many sectors of the business world, corporations prefer to train prospective managers and executives according to their own special methods and needs. These businesses are well acquainted with the value of a person who has chosen to study classics as an undergraduate. In a world of rapid industrial growth in which highly specialized skills quickly become obso\u00ad lete because of changes in technology, the student with a strong background in a respected liberal arts major such as Classics offers the diversity, flexibility, precision, and ability to learn which employers in business, government, and industry find attractive. More specific career information is contained in the publication \"Careers for Classicists\" available from the Department. Graduate Program The Classics graduate program emphasizes individual attention under tutorial conditions and study in small groups. The number of students admitted is carefully limited and work is closely supervised. Each student is associated with various faculty members while developing general competence in the discipline, research methods, and teaching. The principal strength of the program is in the area of literature. The entering student should be qualified at least to the level of the B.A. in Classics; some students may be required to do additional work at the undergraduate level. Students entering with the B.A. are normally expected to com\u00ad plete the Ph.D. program in five years. Completion of a disserta\u00ad tion and its successful oral defense are required. A sample Ph.D. curriculum can be obtained on request from the Department. The M.A. degree may be conferred after two years of satisfac\u00ad tory work. Students meet in one group for regular course work consisting of three elements as follows: (1) a single weekly seminar, covering a different topic each quarter, which may meet on another UC campus in some quar\u00ad ters; most seminars are devoted to major literary topics; (2) a topically arranged directed reading course covering, in a three-year cycle, texts on the reading list; (3) tutorial instruction in Greek and Latin language and advanced prose composition. In addition to the above, instruction is given regularly in the tradition, methods, and tools of classical scholarship, including computer application to literature. In addition to course work, students are required to read exten\u00ad sively in the general field of Classics, under faculty guidance. Students take written examinations, and their progress is assessed periodically. Students are required to pass reading examinations in German and French at an early stage. After course work is completed, each student must pass an individ\u00ad ually designed qualifying examination, covering both the general field of Classics and the student's own interests, in order to become a candidate for the Ph.D. and enter the dissertation stage. The resources of the program are appreciably enhanced by con\u00ad tributions from other sources. In particular, cooperative ar\u00ad rangements are in force among the Classics graduate programs of the UC campuses at Irvine, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara. Additionally, the program calls on visiting scholars, faculty from other UCI departments, and members of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project (see below). Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project, a unique resource for research in Greek literary and linguis~ic studies, is closely affil\u00ad iated with the Department of Classics.

University oflowa, Professor of English (modern and contemporary poetry; poetry writing) The Department of English and Comparative Literature is con\u00ad cerned with the nature and value of literature, possible approaches to literary works, and the relation of literary criti\u00ad cism to the intellectual issues of the d~y. Fundamentally it is concerned with the humanistic problem of value. Thus its main literary concern is critical and theoretical. Though not alone in the task, the Department recognizes a continuing obligation to help all students write the English language with clarity and grace. Students are given the opportunity to participate in departmen\u00ad tal affairs through two elected student committees, one of undergraduates, one of graduates, which are concerned primar\u00ad ily with matters of personnel and curriculum. The committees meet periodically with faculty committees of the Department, and the recommendations of student committees become mat\u00ad ters of record which accompany any recommendations emanat\u00ad ing from the Department. Each quarter all students taking classes within the Department have the opportunity to evaluate the particular course and teacher. Undergraduate Program The Department offers to the undergraduate essentially three areas of study: The Program in Literary Criticism, which emphasizes a vari\u00ad ety of critical approaches in the reading and criticism principally of English and American literature. The Program in Writing, which offers an emphasis in the writing of poetry, fiction, or drama. Undergraduate courses in journalism and nonfiction are also available, including formal instruction and workshop experience for staff members of the UC IRVINE - 1981-1982campus newspaper. The aim of the program is to encourage the creative powers of students while introducing them to the disci\u00ad pline of reading and practical criticism, often in workshop situa\u00ad tions. Under certain circumstances, creative writing courses may satisfy part of the Writing Requirement portion of the UCI breadth requirement (Category 1). See page 15. The Program in Comparative Literature, which, though administratively a part of the Department, is basically interdis\u00ad ciplinary in its orientation, drawing on faculty and other re\u00ad sources from the fields of the various modern and classical lit\u00ad eratures and drama. The consciousness of the modern educated person is the product of centuries of cultural heritage, including not only works of literature in one's own language but world literature from Homer to Gide and Thomas Mann. At UCI, Comparative Literature is regarded as the study of literature from the international point of view rather than in a national framework. A student who completes a degree in Comparative Literature will be expected to have a grasp of the history of literature in its broad outlines and to be able to deal compe\u00ad tently with literary texts, whatever their period or national origins. Since the Department believes that a student of literature should recognize the importance of understanding theoretical problems in literature, of developing a broad acquaintance with literary texts, and of experiencing the problems of literary crea\u00ad tion at first hand, the Department invites students to take work in all three of its programs, with an emphasis in one of the first two (toward a Bachelor's degree in English) or a major in the third (toward a Bachelor's degree in Comparative Literature). Many of the courses will vary in specific content from year to year, depending on the plans of individual teachers, since the Department recognizes that no course can treat all the major authors and works relevant to a given period or topic. Students intending to major in English or Comparative Litera\u00ad ture should obtain a copy of Undergraduate Study in English and Comparative Literature from the departmental office. Compara\u00ad tive Literature is well-suited for students interested in a double major. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: See page 110. Departmental Requirements English: Two courses from theE 28A-B-C or CL 50A-B-C groups (including either E 28A or CL 50A) and a third course either from those two groups or from E 6, 7, 8 or CL 7 or 8; CR 100A-B; CL 100; E 102A-B-C; four courses above 102, at least three of which must be 103s or 104s; competence in a for\u00ad eign language, either classical or modern, equivalent to six quar\u00ad ters of work at Irvine (in classical languages, 1A-B-C and Greek or Latin 100 three times, though Greek or Latin 25 may be substituted for one of the 100 courses}, plus (in modern lan\u00ad _guages) one course in a foreign literature in wh(ch texts are read in the original language; passing performance in the Senior Comprehensive Examination in English (see below). Students selecting a writing emphasis have some flexibility in substituting writing workshops for period and genre courses; their total courses normally number more than the usual major. ENGUSH AND COMPARATIVE UTERATIJRE US Comparative Literature: Sufficient competence in a foreign language, either modern or classical, to be able to deal with facility with any standard literary or critical text in that lan\u00ad guage. If the student intends to continue with graduate work, the study of a second foreign language is highly recommended before graduation. Three quarters of lower-division work: Comparative Literature majors are normally required to take CL 50A-B-C. Transfer students may be required to take one or more courses in the sequence depending on the courses they have taken previously. Normally 10 upper-division courses in addition: usually these will include CR lOOA-8, CL 100, CL 102A-B (required) and either E 103 or CL 103 or CL 104; suitable upper-division course work in the literature of a foreign language; appropriate study in English and American literature; and further study in literature or allied fields as recommended by the advisor. The Comparative Literature Program maintains a comprehen\u00ad sive reading list in world literature, on which CL 50A-B-C and CL 102A-B are based. Students who have not taken and passed one or more of those courses may, by prior arrangement with the Director of the Program, take an examination on relevant parts of the reading list in qualifying for a Bachelor's degree in Compar\u00ad ative Literature. Planning a Program of Study Students should plan, with their faculty advisors, coherent pro\u00ad grams of study, including undergraduate seminars, workshops in writing (for students choosing a writing emphasis), and courses in allied areas outside the Department. It is possible to combine a cluster of courses in literature with other majors in the>sci\u00ad ences and social sciences, and to use an English or Comparative Literature major as preprofessional training in government, law, medicine, etc. Students who wish advice in planning such pro\u00ad grams should consult both the Department and people in their prospective professional areas. Students who intend to pursue a single subject or multiple sub\u00ad ject Teaching Credential must consult with Professor Myron Simon (as well as with the Office of Teacher Education) to ensure that they understand the departmental and state requirements. A student who intends to continue with graduate work is urged to study a second foreign language before graduation. The Senior Comprehensive Course in English (E 102A-B-C) The Senior Comprehensive Course is a three-quarter sequence: E 102A-B-C. Each quarter has its own requirements, usually midterm and final examinations. The course is planned accord\u00ad ing to the Senior Comprehensive Reading List, much of which students are expected to prepare on their own. Divided into three parts by historical periods, the course will ask that a stu\u00ad dent reveal the following: an ability to read any given literary text intelligently; a knowledge of the general outlines of English and American literary history, including the more significant facts and dates; an understanding of the terms appropriate to literary discussion; and a knowledge of the works on the read\u00ad ing list. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982116 ENGUSH AND COMPARATIVE LITERATIJRE Students must take E 102A-B-C in their senior year. A student who fails part one may enroll in a second course, taking a make\u00ad up examination at first opportunity, and so on with parts two and three. No student may take any of the three parts of the course more than three times, and no student who fails to pass all three parts may receive a degree in English. Normally stu\u00ad dents will take the three parts in the A-B-C order; students graduating in an off quarter, however, may vary the sequence. Copies of past examinations may be obtained in the Office of the Department of English and Comparative Literature. Graduate Program The Department's three principal areas of work on the under\u00ad graduate level-English and American Literature, Comparative Literature, and the English major with writing emphasis-are reflected in the graduate programs: the M.A. and Ph.D. in Eng\u00ad lish, the M.A. and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, and the M.F.A. in English (Creative Writing). A student's courses for the M.A. and Ph.D. in English may include or emphasize work in American literature as well; and the faculty is particularly equipped to guide students with special interests in criticism and theory, an area which candidates for the Ph.D. in English or in Comparative Literature may stress in their qualifying exami\u00ad nations and dissertations. Ordinarily students are not admitted to the English or Comparative Literature programs unless they plan to continue, and are qualified to continue, to the degree of Ph.D. Students are admitted to the M.F.A. program chiefly on the basis of submitted creative work. A committee of the Department, with the consent of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, admits students to these programs. Each program has a director appointed by the Department Chair. A deliberate effort is made to maintain close administrative and intellectual ties among the programs. Specific requirements for the graduate degrees will be reached by consultation between members of the faculty and the candi\u00ad date. The first-year graduate student or the candidate for the Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) plans a pro\u00ad gram with an assigned advisor; candidates for the Ph.D. plan with an advisor and three-person committee. At the time of the M.A. examination, the Graduate Committee evaluates the stu\u00ad dent's graduate career up to that point and offers advice about future prospects. Candidates for literary degrees are encouraged to study philosophy, history, foreign languages and literatures, and the fine arts. Applicants for graduate degrees in English and Comparative Literature must submit scores for the Graduate Record Exami\u00ad nation (GRE) including the Advanced Literature in English Test; applicants must also submit sample papers and a statement about competence in foreign languages. Part-time graduate work is not permitted. Only in exceptional circumstances will students be permitted to undertake programs of less than six full courses during the academic year. The nor\u00ad mal expectation, however, is enrollment in three courses each quarter, except for Teaching Assistants, who take two courses in addition to earning credit for University Teaching. Students who are not teaching should be able to complete course work in two years, plus a quarter or a summer for preparation for M.A. examination, which normally is taken after about nine courses. The Ph.D. qualifying examination should be taken within a couple of quarters after courses are finished. Dissertations can frequently be written in a year. The Ph.D. in English normally should be completed in five years or less; the Ph.D. in Compar\u00ad ative Literature normally should be completed in six years or less. The Department recognizes that many of its graduate students intend to become teachers, and it believes that graduate depart\u00ad ments should be training college teachers as well as scholars\u00ad indeed, that teaching and most literary scholarship complement one another. Thus the Department has initiated a program by which all its Ph.D. candidates, in English as well as in Compara\u00ad tive Literature, may gain supervised training as part of the for\u00ad mal seminar work required for the degree. M.F.A. candidates als.o have the opportunity of participation in this program. All those interested in graduate study in the Department should obtain the brochure on graduate programs from the departmen\u00ad tal office. English Master of Arts in English Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate ad-\u00b7 visor who will supervise the student's program. The M.A. plan of study includes ( 1) the completion of course work, as ad\u00ad vised, for three quarters or the equivalent; (2) demonstrated proficiency in reading a designated foreign language, modern or classical; and ( 3) the passing of a written examination upon a designated reading list. Exceptional students may be exempted from taking the examination by petitioning the Graduate Committee, which will review the student's performance and qualifications in arriving at its decision. The candidate must take all formal work in graduate-level courses and seminars. Master of Fine Arts in English The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.). is a degree in creative writing. The M.F.A. degree is normally conferred upon the completion of a two-year residence. Each quarter the candidate will be enrolled in either the poetry or fiction section of the Graduate Writers' Workshop, which will constitute two-thirds of a course load, the other course to be selected in consultation with the student's advisor. The fifth quarter of work toward the degree may be taken at the lnstituto Allende, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. It is expected that M.F.A. candidates will complete at least one supervised teaching seminar. In addition to course work, the candidate is required to pass an examination on a reading list of literary works in the genre selected, and to present as a thesis an acceptable book-length manuscript of poetry or short stories, or a novel. Doctor of\u00b7Philosophy in English The program for the Ph.D. in English requires about two years of full-time enrollment in regular courses beyond.the B.A. (two of which may be in the graduate teachb.g program); proficiency in the reading of two acceptable foreign languages, modern or classical; the dissertation; and satisfactory performance on designated examinations. The languages acceptable depend upon the nature of the stu\u00ad dent's program as determined by the student's advisors. Read- UC IRVINE - 1981-1982ing competence in one of these languages must be established in the first year of residence, and competence in the second well before the general examination. Students admitted at the post-M.A. level must provide evidence of satisfactory competence in foreign languages. Competence in one of the two languages required for the Ph.D. is verified through a course in theory and practice of translation; the other language may be verified through examination. Upon completion of course work the srudent takes general examinations on literary theory and criticism; some particular literary form, genre, style, theme, or structure; a historical period; a group of authors; and a specific topic. The first four of these examinations are written; the fifth is oral. The srudent has the opporrunity to present personal choices for the examina\u00ad tion, but the choices must enable an individual to demonstrate breadth of knowledge as well as literary understanding and therefore must be approved by the advisory committee. Upon satisfactorily completing the general examination and the oral Qualifying Examination, the srudent is admitted to candi\u00ad dacy for the degree. As soon after completion of the general examination as is practical, the srudent presents an essay leading to dissertation for the approval of the doctoral committee. Submission of an acceptable dissertation completes the Ph.D. All work for the Ph.D. degree must be in courses limited to graduate srudents. Comparative Literature There are at least four avenues by which the student may approach graduate work in Comparative Literarure: 1. An undergraduate major in Comparative Literature equival\u00ad ent to the one described above; 2. An English major, provided that a sufficient background in at least one foreign language is demonstrated (a beginning on a second foreign language is desirable); 3. A normal major in drama, with same proviso as 1. above; 4. A normal major in a foreign language, provided that a suffi\u00ad cient general background in world literature is demonstrated. Make-up work will be required before graduate srudies can begin if one of these avenues has not been taken. At the graduate level, the srudy of Comparative Literature becomes more specialized, with the srudent engaged in a particu\u00ad lar area of research and dealing with such problems as the development of genres, interrelations between literatures, the theory and practice of translation, and other literary questions transcending national boundaries. For the graduate srudent in Comparative Literarure a profes\u00ad sional competence in foreign languages is essential. French and German are usually required for all doctoral candidates, since these languages along with English are the accepted tools of international literary scholarship. A classical language may prove indispensable for wo;:k in many traditional fields of liter\u00ad ary srudy, and the scholar's own specialty may require the mas\u00ad tery of other languages. The underlying assumption of language requirements is that, after the tool languages have been mas\u00ad tered, the professional scholar's own interests should determine the specific kinds and degrees of language skill to be acquired. ENGUSH AND COMPARATIVE LITERA11JRE 117 At the graduate level, the nucleus of the foreign language re\u00ad quirement is the course CL 220 (Problems in Translation) in which, after a suitable theoretical preparation; the srudent plans and carries out a high-quality translation of a literary text; The translation, along with an introduction or other scholarly ap\u00ad paratus explaining and defending the technical decisions in\u00ad volved in the task, is then submitted as a paper for course credit. Master of Arts in Comparative Literature Students entering the Master of Arts program should complete their course work in three quarters. This course work should include CL 220 (Problems in Translation) with a project in either French or German and appropriate graduate-level work in English, foreign .languages, drama, comparative literature, and other areas as counselled by the advisor. Soon after beginning graduate work the srudent, with the advice and approval of the assigned advisor, will decide on a field of specialty which will be emphasized in progressing toward the M.A. degree. (Normally this choice will be a preliminary step toward the selection of an area of specialty for the Ph.D.) Graduate srudy in Comparative Literature requires an excep\u00ad tional facility in foreign languages, and the srudent should not attempt a Master's degree without a thorough knowledge of one foreign language and literature and a considerable knowledge of a second language. Normally the greatest part of the srudent's work will involve the srudy of literary texts in the original languages. At the end of course work, normally about nine courses at the graduate level, the srudent will be examined on a reading list in world literature that the srudent's committee has approved. This list should be designed by the srudent in consultation with the committee and based on the general World Literature list for Comparative Literature. The srudent's own list should fol\u00ad low some organizing principle, such as an emphasis on the fields and languages of the srudent's specialization. Nevertheless, every list sho1,1ld include works from all of the different groups represented on the general World Literature list. The M.A. examination is a three-hour written examination, which focuses on essay questions based on the srudent's approved reading list. Exceptional students may be exempted from taking the exami\u00ad nation by petitioning the Graduate Committee which will review the srudent's performance and qualifications in arriving at its decision. Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative Literature The Doctoral program is designed to prepare the srudent for a professional career as a scholar and critic of literature. Details of the doctoral program in Comparative Literature may be ob\u00ad tained from the Director. Normally the degree requires two years of course work (usually a minimum of three courses per quarter). Of these courses, the only required course is CL 220 (Problems in Translation), which is taken twice, with projects in acceptable languages. The rest of the student's work will be in seminars or other graduate-level courses in Comparative Litera\u00ad ture, English, the various foreign language departments, or drama. In general an exceptional command of foreign languages is required, normally involving a professional competence in two or more foreign languages, either modern or classical. The doc- UC IRVINE - 1981-1982118 ENGUSH AND COMPARATIVE LftERATIJRE toral student is encouraged to design and carry out a personal plan of study (the area of specialty) in a particular field of inter\u00ad est. The requirements for the doctorate also include an area of competence in literary theory and practical criticism; a student may also stress theory in preparation for the Qualifying Examination. Upon completion of the course work, the student will be exam\u00ad ined in the following areas of knowledge: ( 1) mastery of a limited topic in literary theory or history of criticism, along with general knowledge of major critical texts in the history of literature; (2) an area of specialty as described above; and ( 3) major works and authors appropriate to the study of com\u00ad parative literature. Following this examination, and upon rec\u00ad ommendation of a candidacy committee appointed by the Graduate Council, the student is formally admitted to candidacy. The study toward the degree of Doctor of Philosophy will cul\u00ad minate in the writing of a suitable dissertation, normally on a comparative subject, although subjects lying within a single literature or dealing with general literary and aesthetic problems not confined to any specific literatures may also be acceptable. Studies of the relation between literature and the other arts are also encouraged. Undergraduate Courses Satisfaction of the Subject A requirement is a prerequisite for all departmental courses except E 6, 7, 8 and CL 7, 8. How\u00ad ever, students scoring from 550 to 600 on the College Board English Composition Achievement Test normally should be able to satisfy the Subject A requirement with the same courses they take to satisfy the lower-division Writing Requirement of the breadth requirement (Category 1).

It seeks to enrich the students' appreciation of their own civilizations and to create a deeper sense of interna\u00ad tional understanding. The program brings the students to participate in the creative process of language, to think in French or Italian as they learn to understand, speak, read, and write. Most classes are taught entirely in the foreign language, and a multiple approach stresses the interdependence of the four basic skills and makes them mutually reinforcing. The Language Laboratory is used to com\u00ad plement classroom activity. Representatives chosen by the undergraduate French majors and by the graduate students serve on departme'ntal committees. These representatives also participate in Department meetings and are responsible for student evaluation procedures. Undergraduate Program in French While preparing the student for graduate work and for the teaching profession, the French major is essentially a liberal arts program offering a broad, humanistic course of study. At the intermediate lower-division level, texts of contemporary literary and social interest provide the focus for advanced con\u00ad versation, reading, and composition. After the second year, courses in speaking (conversation and phonetics) and writing enable the students to attain a greater degree of proficiency, preparing them for further study in French literature and linguistics and in French civilization and culture. In the introductory courses in literature, complete texts are studied by genre. The student learns to analyze and interpret different types of creative literature and is introduced to various critical techniques. At the more advanced level, literature courses may emphasize a single author, movement, or genre within a historical period. The content of these courses changes yearly according to the interests of both faculty and students. Senior seminars are offered periodically to discuss literary prob\u00ad Jems which cannot be dealt with in depth in the regular offerings. Courses in civilization and culture explore aspects of French his\u00ad tory, intellectual thought, and the arts. Courses are offered with a historical emphasis (for instance, The World of the Renais\u00ad sance in France; The Age of Louis XIV; colonialism; anti\u00ad Semitism) and with a comparative orientation (for instance, Poetry and Painting; Literature and Society; Women in Litera\u00ad ture; Paris and the History of Art; Literature and History). Courses in linguistics introduce students to aspects of the struc\u00ad ture of the French language and to the application of linguistic techniques to problems of literary analysis. Students are placed in elementary and intermediate courses according to their years of previous study and their grades; no placement exami\"nation is given. One year of high school is equated with one quarter of work at UCI. A student may not go back more than one quarter and receive credit. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: See page 110. Departmental Requirements French Major with Emphasis in Literature: French 11, lOOA-B, 101A-B-C, and eight other upper-division courses taught in French, at least six of which must be in literature. French Major with Emphasis in Linguistics: French 11, 100A-B, 101A-B-C, two courses in French civilization, Linguis\u00ad tics 50, 110, 120, 130, and French 113, 131. Prospective ele\u00ad mentary and secondary school teachers who choose this option should take as electives additional courses in French language, civilization, and/or literature. Work in French civilization is required by state credentialing authorities. French Major with Emphasis in Culture and Civilization: French 11; 100A-B, 101A-B-C, and eight other upper-division courses taught in French, at least four of which must be in civil\u00ad ization and culture. Planning a Program of Study The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program of courses to fulfull the literature, the linguistics, or the culture and civilization empha\u00ad sis during the junior year. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982The Department encourages the student to study in France, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or independently. Information is available in the Department Office. Students should consult with the departmental coordinator of advisors concerning career plans in the areas of teaching, indus\u00ad try, journalism, law, civil service, etc. Undergraduate Program in Italian Third-and fourth-year offerings provide an introduction to Ital\u00ad ian literature and culture that serves as a basis for composition, conversation, and phonetics. Tutorial and seminar courses are available for advanced stu\u00ad dents. Students are encouraged to pursue their interests through a major in Humanities, leading to a B.A. degree in Humanities, which combines Italian literatun;, culture, history, art, and music. Graduate Program in French The Department stresses understanding rather than encyclo\u00ad pedic knowledge, experimentation with various critical approaches rather than the perpetuation of a tradition, creativ\u00ad ity rather than conformity. Each quarter internationally known scholars are in residence to participate in the graduate program. Students choose their courses from three categories: 1. Critical Theory: problems in French literature and criticism; 2. Com\u00ad parative Methods; 3. Author, Genre, Period, Movement Master of Arts in French The Master of Arts degree is considered to be a step toward the Ph.D. degree; only students intending to pursue studies for the doctorate are admitted to the program. Performance on the Master's examination, usually given in the second year of gradu\u00ad ate study, determines entrance into the doctoral program. Most candidates take a minimum of 11 graduate courses, with at least six in literature, one in linguistics, and one in writing and style. Particularly well-prepared students may receive special permis\u00ad sion to take a minimum of nine courses and to write a short thesis, for which two course credits are given. All entering grad\u00ad uate students are assigned a faculty advisor. Individual programs are arranged in consultation with the faculty advisors. During . the spring quarter of each year, the teaching performance and academic record of each student who is a Teaching Assistant are evaluated. All graduate students are also given a written evalua\u00ad tion of their work on a course-by-course basis. Proficiency in a foreign language in addition to French is required (proficiency is defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C). All M.A. candidates are required to pass a written and oral comprehensive examination on material drawn from the class program and the Master of Arts reading list. The student writes essays demonstrating an understanding of theoretical concepts and their application to the study of specific literary texts as well as an ability to establish relationships among literary works of different periods, genres, or authors. The written examina\u00ad tion also allows the student to present an original topic of research. The oral part of the examination allows elaboration on aspects of the written examination, but seeks primarily to test the students' broader knowledge. FRENCH AND ITAIJAN 121 The Master's examination is given in mid-fall quarter and at the end of winter quarter. Students who are Teaching Assistants normally take the examination in the fifth quarter of their studies. Doctor of Philosophy in French Upon successful completion of the Master's examinations and admission to the Ph.D. program, or admission with a Master's degree from an accredited institution, a Guidance Committee is appointed to advise the candidate in the choice of courses to help prepare for the written and oral Qualifying Examinations leading to advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The formal Guidance Committee is composed of five members in fields closely related to the student's interest and projected area of specialization in which the dissertation will be prepared and one member who is not affiliated with the School. One member of the committee will be expected to direct the dissertation. Language Requirements: A reading knowledge of two foreign languages relevant to the student's area of specialization and subject to the approval of the Guidance Committee. Course Requirements: A minimum of 18 graduate courses or seminars in French beyond the B.A., including one graduate course in French linguistics, o\u00b7ne graduate course in writing and style, and three graduate courses outside the Department in areas related to the field of specialization. Students entering with a B.A. degree are required to take at least three courses in each of these three course categories as they progress to the Ph.D. degree; students entering with an M.A. degree must take at least two in each area. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with particular emphasis in literary theory by taking additional course work in theory beyond the minimum number required. Teaching: Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candi\u00ad dates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, as far as it is possible, all candidates without previous teaching experience are required to participate in a program of supervised teaching for at least one year. Qualifying Examination -Written and Oral: Upon com\u00ad pletion of course work, the student takes a series of written open book examinations involving clearly defined problems of a critical or historical nature. The student may be given from one to three days to answer any part of the examination. The oral Qualifying Examination assesses the student's knowledge of French literature and understanding of a given literary move\u00ad ment. The student will be examined on (a) five of the following six periods of French literature: Medieval; Sixteenth Century; Seventeenth Century; Eighteenth Century; Nineteenth Century; Twentieth Century; or four of these periods plus the develop\u00ad ment of a single literary genre through all periods of French literature; (b) a given literary movement (e.g., Romanticism, Baroque, etc.) in a non-French literature. The written and oral parts of the examination are based both on material covered in the graduate seminars and on the Ph.D. reading list. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of the written and oral Qualifying Examina\u00ad tions, the student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Dissertation: The dissertation topic chosen by the candidate will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. The dissertation UC IRVINE - 1981-1982122 FRENCH AND ITAUAN must be defended in an oral examination and approved by the Doctoral Committee before the candidate is recommended for the degree. Three faculty members, chosen by. the candidate, proposed by the Department, and appointed by the Graduate Council, con\u00ad stitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doctoral Committee supervises an oral defense, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral dissertation, and certifies that a com\u00ad pleted dissertation is satisfactory.

Saine, Ph.D. Yale University, Chair of the Department and Professor of German Anton Kaes, Ph.D. Stanford University, Associate Professor of German and Comparative Literature and Director of the Program in Compara\u00ad tive Literature Meredith Lee, Ph.D. Yale University, Assistant Professor of German Herbert Lehnert, Ph.D. University of Kiel, Professor of German William J. Lillyman, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of German and Dean of the School of Humanities Bert Nagel, Ph.D. University of Heidelberg, Professor Emeritus of German Wilfried M. Voge, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Lecturer in German and Linguistics The Department of German sees its contribution in the context of the humanistic endeavor to understand and evaluate Western culture. We can understand ourselves and our immediate cul\u00ad ture more clearly through the study of allied and diverse lan\u00ad guages and cultures. The study of German (which is closely related to English) and a comparative study of the historical and social development of German-speaking peoples provide the student with another aspect of our common culture. The Department offers courses on the German language and on German literature. The study of German literature is pursued from various critical perspectives. Some courses emphasize its historical, social, and political significance and setting; in others literature is approached as an imaginative experience which transcends its immediate context. The history of German litera\u00ad ture and criticism, the theory of literature and literary criticism, and the relations of German literature to other literatures are also studied in the Department's courses. Undergraduate Program The German major offers alternative emphases; one in literature and another in linguistics. All courses in the Department are taught in German to the extent compatible with the aim of the course. In the basic courses the student will develop an understanding of the nature of the language, based on linguistic principles, while learning the UC IRVINE - 1981-1982124GERMAN necessary skills. Use will be made of the Language Laboratory. At the end of the first year, students will have attained mastery of the basic structure of the language. At the intermediate and advanced levels the student's ability to read and write German will be gradually developed. A\" third\u00ad year course of two quarters will stress composition as opposed to translation. It will be followed by a course in phonetics which will aim to perfect the pronunciation as well as to intro\u00ad duce historical and dialectal variants. The introductory course in literature, also in the third year, will present a first view of some periods of German literary history, familiarize the student with German terminology used in the interpretation of litera\u00ad ture, and use these concepts in practical interpretations. A cer\u00ad tain number of courses in the series German 117, 118, 119, 120 will be designated as \"core courses\" which are especially recommended for majors. It is assumed that the student is familiar with basic concepts of literature in English. Students are given the opportunity to participate in programs of study abroad during the summer and the junior year in Gottingen. Students entering UCI with previous German training will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school German will normally enroll in German 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B respectively. Exceptions to this placement procedure must have the approval of the director of first-or second-year German instruction. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: See page 110. Departmental Requirements German Major with Literature Emphasis: German 100A-B\u00ad C; German 101; eight courses drawn from German 102-199, the selection to be approved by the student's advisor; at least one course selected from the following: Linguistics 50; Com\u00ad parative Literature 50A-B-C; courses in German history and German philosophy (advisor's approval required). Students who plan to acquire a teaching credential, or intend to do graduate work in literature, are encouraged to take the major with literature emphasis. German Major with Linguistic Emphasis: German 100A-B\u00ad C; German 101; five literature courses drawn from German 102-199, to be approved by the advisor; Linguistics 50, 110, 120; at least one of the following: Linguistics 130; Introduction' to Middle High German or History of the German Language (these courses are offered under German 220). The German major with linguistic emphasis is recommended especially for students who intend to do graduate work in lin\u00ad guistics or enter a linguistics-related profession. Graduate Program In its graduate courses the Department stresses theoretical understanding of the nature of literature in its specific applica\u00ad tion to literature written in the German language. Courses also are offered elucidating the structure and history of the German language. The German Graduate Program is essentially a program leading to the Ph.D. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in aca\u00ad demic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of full-time graduate study. The Department will decide after completion of the M.A., at the latest, whether or not to ._permit the student to continue in the Ph.D. program. The M.A. thus may be in some cases a terminal degree. In those cases where the student enters the UCI graduate program in German with an M.A. from another institution, the Department will evaluate the student's progress during the first year of study before deciding to allow continuation toward the Ph.D. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. Master of Arts in German Before entering the program, a candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. Students with a bache\u00ad lor's degree in another subject may be considered for admission. Normally their course of studies will have to be extended in order to make up for the deficiency. However, each case is con\u00ad sidered individually by the faculty. The minimum course requirement for the M.A. degree is nine courses, eight of which must be taken within the Department of German. Reading knowledge of a foreign language other than German also is required for the M.A. degree. Further requirements follow. The Preparation of a Reading List. All candidates should prepare as early as possible a list of works read in the field of German literature, e.g., both primary texts and critical works. This list should preferably be augmented by critical texts and by works from other literatures which, in the candidate's opinion, relate to the German works in the list. Since it should ultimately contain representative selections from various eras of German literature and some works of criticism, a tentative list must be discussed with the graduate advisor before the end of the fall quarter. Candidates should indicate on the list a number of works with which they are especially familiar. In its final form (e.g., including works read during the year both in and out of class) the list will be submitted together with the essay two weeks before the oral examination. It is the student's responsi\u00ad bility to keep the reading list current. The Master's Essay. The purpose of the written part of the M.A. comprehensive examination is to show the candidate's methodological progress in interpreting German literature. It consists of an essay in which a text is elucidated and related to: a) pertinent works by the. same author, b) its social and histori\u00ad cal context, a~d c) other works of German or other literatures with which the candidate is familiar. The level of the discussion will normally be enhanced by the candidate's knowledge of the relevant secondary literature. The topic of the essay should be tentatively formulated and reported to the graduate advisor before the end of the second quarter of the student's residence. The Oral Examination. During the oral examination the fol\u00ad lowing items will be discussed: a) the essay, b) the reading list. The discussion based on the reading list will focus on works which the student knows well, but may broaden into other areas. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982One Course in University Teaching (399) One Year of Residence Ph.D. in German The Department requires a minimum of 24 approved courses from students entering with a bachelor's degree. Students enter\u00ad ing with the master's degree will be advised individually as to remaining course requirements. These may include courses in philosophy, history, comparative literature, etc., suitable for the individual student's program of study. The Introduction to Middle High German and one course in medieval German liter\u00ad ature are required. The student also will enroll in each of the German Department's colloquia. The student will augment the reading list and keep it current during the whole course of study. At least two years of residence are required. Since the majority of Ph.D. candidates choose careers as teachers, the German Department recognizes its obligation to offer them preparatory experience. Therefore, all candidates for the Ph.D. are required to teach under the supervision of a faculty member at least one course in each of three quarters (for which they will receive credit as German 399). Three of these courses may be counted toward the 24 required courses for the Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination. There.are two parts to the examination. In order to fulfill the writt~n examination require\u00ad ment the student will choose either 1) to present a lecture to the faculty and to the other graduate students, or 2) to write a three-part examination (one part on a significant author, one on a major genre, and one on a historical period) within a period of two weeks. These examination essays may be either closed- \\ book or take-home, by agreement with the candidate's examina\u00ad tion committee. The examination essays or the lecture will be on a text or texts selected by the faculty from a reading list submitted by the student for the comprehensive examination. The second part of the comprehensive examination is the for\u00ad mal oral qualifying examination of up to three hours duration ranging over the whole field of the student's studies, to be taken within two weeks after completion of the written examination. The student will submit the reading list at least two weeks before the written examination after consultation with the members of the examination committee. Language Requirements. The candidate will demonstrate reading competence in two languages or extensive competence in one language rither than German or English. Choice of this language depends on the student's area of specialization. For the various ways in which these requirements may be fulfilled, the student should see the graduate advisor. Dissertation. Toward the end of the second year of study, the student should formulate a tentative dissertation topic. Three faculty members proposed by the Department and appointed by the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and completion of the dissertation. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed dissertation ~ satisfactory through the signature of the Committee members on the title page of the dissertation.

Wiener, Ph.D. Harvard University, Associate Professor of History (history and social theory) Undergraduate Program The undergraduate program in History is designed to develop critical intelligence and to foster an awareness of ourselves and our world through the study of the past. The Department offers a variety of approaches to history, and each emphasizes basic disciplinary skills: weighing evidence, expository writing, con\u00b7 structing logical arguments, and exploring the role of theory in historical analysis and human action. In addition to offering a number of lower-division history courses open to nonmajors, the Department requires all History majors to participate in an introductory core course, History 29A-B-C. This is a comparative course that acquaints students with the modern world by examining some of the basic charac\u00ad teristics of modernity and by focusing on the historic process of modernization in several different societies. From this introductory course the student moves on to a series of upper-division courses, the contents of which range from the examination of individual nation-states (e.g., British History), to studies of the relations among nation-states (e.g., European International History), to analyses of political, socio-economic, and cultural factors as they have developed through time (e.g., Mass Movements and Social Control). Students are also pro\u00ad vided the opportunity for small-group learning experiences in a series of colloquia in the following areas: social history, political history, international history, intellectual history, social thought, and comparative history. These courses bring a definite focus to the undergraduate major. Finally, colloquia and seminars for seniors concentrate on a particular aspect of more general phenomena (e.g., Hitler and World War II). The training and discipline derived from historical studies pro\u00ad vide a valuable experience for all educated persons seeking to understand themselves and their world. They also provide a useful preparation for professional careers in teaching, law, librarianship, journalism, and business administration. Faculty members in the Department of History work closely with their students. Elected student representatives-both grad\u00ad uate and undergraduate-participate regularly with faculty at Department meetings and serve on major Department commit\u00ad tees. Students also participate in the evaluation of teaching by faculty and Teaching Assistants. All upper-division History majors are assigned a facultyadvisor, whom they are encour\u00ad aged to consult at least once each quarter. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: See page 110. Departmental Requirements Fourteen courses are required, including History 29A-B-C (for which transfer students may substitute such year-long surveys as European, American, Asian, or Latin American history), six upper-division Historical Studies, three colloquia, and a senior seminar (two-course sequence) or two additional colloquia. Graduate Program The graduate program leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in History is designed to provide students with both basic histori- UC IRVINE - 1981-1982cal skills and a rigorous grounding in social and other compara\u00ad tive theory. This combination of theoretical study with training in historical method reflects the Deparrment's conviction that scholars should be encouraged to deal with broad questions about the past and to approach these questions in a methodo\u00ad logically sophisticated way. This approach requires that the stu\u00ad dent develop the critical abilities necessary to deal with primary sources, secondary syntheses, and the interrelationship of his\u00ad tory and theory. Candidates for any advanced degree in History are expected to gain teaching experience as an integral part of their graduate training. Ordinarily this is accomplished through service as a Teaching Assistant or Associate. Basic to the Department's curriculum is a year-long course in History and Theory which deals with both theoretical texts and historical studies that have tested the theorists' concepts and models. The History and Theory course also examines the phe\u00ad nomenon of moderniziation-the general world transformation ofthe past four hundred years-and seeks to understand the social institutions through which this process occurred and con\u00ad tinues. The course directs attention to the diverse implications of modernity in the modern world, to the groups which domi\u00ad nated and were dominated by it, and to the costs and benefits of the process. These matters can be studied most satisfactorily by the historian whose theoretical self-conciousness and methodo\u00ad logical facility have been systematically and carefully developed. A two-quarter research seminar is offered fall and winter quar\u00ad ters every year and is required of all graduate students (includ\u00ad ing those entering with an M.A. degree) in both their first and second years. This course familiarizes students with at least one of the functional approaches to history (e.g., social, political, intellectual, international), the modes in which it has been writ\u00ad ten, and the methodologies available within it. At the same time the course makes it possible for sti.Idents to begin carrying out projects of original research. / The colloquium, a reading course that examines the chief histor\u00ad ical works in a \"time-place\" field, enriches the student's knowl\u00ad edge of the main areas of historical research and develops criti\u00ad cal reading skills. Colloquia are offered yearly in American his tory and modern European history, and biannually in Early Modern European history, Latin American history, and Ancient history. A student may prepare a dissertation in any of these fields. In addition, independent reading and research courses are provided for advanced, specialized study in a tutorial form. The immediate objective for the doctoral student is to develop four fields of competence in preparation for comprehensive examination. These fields are: history and theory; first \"time\u00ad place\" field (field in which the dissertation is written); second \"time-place\" field; \"focus\" field (such as social, political, intel\u00ad lectual, or international history). The subsequent objective, to write a distinctive dissertation, is of crucial importance. To assist in accomplishing both objec\u00ad tives, the Department offers intensive consultation with the faculty as well as a lively intell~ctual atmosphere. Students have long shared in the decision-making processes of the Depart\u00ad ment, which engages the entire historical community at Irvine in HISTORY 127 the collective pursuit of excellence. Students profit also from a vigorous visiting speakers program that brings scholars from other campuses and other nations to meet and interact with UCI students and faculty. Master of Arts in History Requirements for Admission. Though it is desirable that an applicant have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in His\u00ad tory, the Department also welcomes students who have pre\u00ad viously specialized in other subject areas and who show promise of sustained and self-disciplined work in history. Typically, a minimum undergraduate grade point average of 3.0 (B) is required for admission, with evidence of better work in history. In addition, all applicants are asked to submit three letters of recommendation, aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination, and examples of written work in history from their undergraduate classes. Students living in Southern Cali\u00ad fornia must arrange to come to UCI for an interview with the Department Chair or the Coordinator of Graduate Advising. Students are admitted for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is May 1. Program of Study. The M.A. program emphasizes the theoret\u00ad ical, comparative, and social dimensions of the field in general, and of European, American, or Latin American history in par\u00ad ticular. Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a gradu\u00ad ate advisor who will supervise the student's program. Nine courses are required for the degree: three in History and Theory (History 200A-B-C), three in \"time-place\" colloquia (taken in sequence, as a unit), two in a two-quarter research seminar, and one from other \"time-place\" colloquia or from upper-division offerings. Students intending to pursue the Ph.D. should begin at once to delineate doctoral interests in order to fit their work for the M.A. into the total program. Language Requirements. Normally a reading knowledge of one foreign language is required for the M.A. degree. Students in American history, with an advisor's permission, may substi\u00ad tute a sequence of courses in communications science, statistics, or comparable studies for the M.A.. foreign language require\u00ad ment. Language proficiency can be demonstrated either by achieving a score of at least 500 on the appropriate ETS exami\u00ad nation or by passing a departmental examination. Comprehensive Examination. At the end of the final quarter the M.A. candidate must pass a comprehensive examination covering the student's major field (e.g., American, Early Mod\u00ad ern Europe) and focusing upon material assigned in the three\u00ad quarter \"time-place\" colloquium series. Time Limits. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of graduate study. Doctor of Philosophy in History Requirements for Admission. Continuing students must have satisfactorily passed a deparrmental evaluation in order to be admitted to the doctoral program. New students must undergo a more formal admissions proce\u00ad dure, submitting transcripts, letters (three), papers, and aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination. These docu\u00ad ments must be supplemented by an interview whenever possible. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982128HISTORY It would be advisable for the potential doctoral student to begin graduate work on this campus, since the doctoral student who has taken the M.A. elsewhere will be expected to enroll in most of the same courses required of incoming M.A. students (greater experience will work to advantage later, in the second and third years, in speeding the student to examinations). Incoming students are admitted for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is May 1. Program of Study. The Department requires doctoral students to prepare themselves in four different areas: 1. History and Theory. 2. The first \"time-place\" field (such as Modem Europe), which is designed as a teaching field as well as the focus of the stu\u00b7 dent's dissertation. 3. The second \"time-place\" field (such as American History), which is designed as a second teaching field. 4. A \"focus\" field (such as social history, etc.), which is designed to enhance the student's capability for dealing with the problems and phenomena of the field, to make comparisons, and to inttoduce the student to the theory and method of rele\u00ad vant related disciplines (e.g., sociology). The courses required in this preparation include the History and Theory sequence, colloquia series in both time-place fields, and the two research seminar sequences (two quarters each). Beyond these, the remainder of the student's program during the first six quarters of residence will consist of those colloquia, seminars, and courses in Special Studies. The normal academic load is three courses per quarter. Every doctoral student will be assisted by a departmental ad\u00ad visor in the same general area of study who will be responsible for approving defined fields, guiding the student to consultant faculty, and supervising the examinations. Language Requirements. All students, except as specified below, must demonsttate a reading knowledge of one foreign language relevant to the field of graduate study, no later than the end of the second year in the program. Normally, the M.A. for\u00ad eign language will fulfill this requirement, but proficiency can also be established by a score of at least 500 on the appropriate ETS examination or by passing a department test. Students in American history who have opted for a language substitute in completing the UCI Master's degree will be allowed to submit this work in fulfillment of the alternate skill requirements dis\u00ad cussed below, and will not be subject to the time limit in achiev\u00ad ing a foreign language competence. Additional language requirements depend on the subject the student selects for the first \"time-place\" field and must be met before the student takes the candidacy qualifying examinations. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in American his\u00ad tory may either demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second useful foreign language (by achieving an ETS score of 500 or by passing a language test designed by the advisor), or complete, as a doctoral student, a sequence of courses in an alternate skill (e.g., communications science, statistics, computer work, con\u00ad tent analysis, linguistics) that will be useful in mastering the chosen historical fields. \u00b7 \u00b7 An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in a non-American subject must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second for\u00ad eign language. This may be done either by achieving an ETS score of 500 or by passing a language test arranged by the advisor. Qualifying Examinations and Dissertation. After complet\u00ad ing the appropriate courses and other preparatory work (nor\u00ad mally seven to nine quarters after entering the graduate program at UCI), the student will take written examinations in the His\u00ad tory and Theory and two \"time-place\" fields, followed by the oral QJ.lalifying Examination in the \"focus\" field, first \"time\u00ad place\" field, and dissertation topic. Upon successful completion of these examinations, the student will be advanced to candi\u00ad dacy and will begin intensive work upon the dissertation. The research and writing involved in this effort are expected to re\u00ad quire from one to two years. At the end of this period an oral defense of the dissertation will be held, focusing on the ade\u00ad quacy of the student's research and thesis. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS IN THE HUMANITIES Undergraduate Major in Humanities The major in Humanities is one of the many options available to a student who wants to select a major in the School of Humanities. As such, the major in Humanities is on a par with the major in Spanish, the major in Classics, the major in Lin\u00ad guistics, and other majors in the School. The major in Humani\u00ad ties accommodates students who want to organize their under\u00ad graduate education around a humanistic perspective on a topic, a field, or a problem which is interdisciplinary in scope (e.g., Literature and Politics in Twentieth-Century America; Social and Religious Thought in the Age of the Reformation). The student enters the program at the end of the sophomore year and, in consultation with the Humanities Major Committee, devises an individually tailored set of \"major requirements,\" not all of which need be offered in the School of Humanities. The Committee will assign an advisor on the basis of the stu\u00ad dent's own preference. At the end of the senior year the student will prepare, under the advisor's supervision, a long paper in the area of the special major. This requirement is satisfied by taking Humanities 199. A student majoring in the Humanities must also meet the regular School, UCI, and University requirements for graduation. (Seep. 14 and p. 110.) Inquiries by third\u00ad quarter sophomores should be addressed to the academic coun\u00ad selors in the School's Office of Undergraduate Study. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Concentration in Film Studies Participating Faculty Franco Tonelli, Ph.D. Louisiana State University, Director (film the\u00ad ory; French and Italian cinema) Susan Barber, Visiting Lecturer (history of film; American cinema) David Carroll, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University (film history and criticism; French cinema; film and society) Eugenio Donato, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University (film theory; Italian cinema) Thomas Girvin, Visiting Lecturer (film production) Renee Riese Hubert, Ph.D. Columbia University (Surrealist film/fan\u00ad tastic film; early comedy) Anton Kaes, Ph.D. Stanford University (semiology of film; history and sociology of German cinema) Alejandro Morales, Ph.D. Rutgers University (Latin American film) A student may major in Humanities with a concentration in Film Studies. The major centers on an interdisciplinary study of film history and criticism. The program is designed to study filmic concepts through a core of courses which will concentrate on film theory, history of film, formal structures, ideology, and relationship to the other art forms. While the Humanities' concentration in Film Studies empha\u00ad sizes history and theory of film, through courses such as Humanities SOA-B-C, Humanities 197, and Humanities 198 it tries to expose the student to practical and/ or technical aspects of the study of cinema as well. In these latter courses students acquire practical experience in script writing, directing, camera, sound, editing, and applied aesthetic. The Theatrical Film Sym\u00ad posium (Humanities SOC) brings in a visiting writer, producer, director, perfOJcmer, or the like to screen their latest work and discuss it with the students. Students majoring in Humanities with a concentration in Film Studies may spend their junior year in France studying at the Inter-University Center for Film and Critical Studies in Pa<ris, through a program sponsored by the University's Education Abroad Program (EAP). Information is available in the Film Studies Office and from the EAP Office. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: See page 110. Program Requirements: Humanities 50, 101A-B-C, 110, 112 (two courses), 115, and 199, and four upper-division courses from the following: French 160, Italian 160, German 160, Russian 160, Spanish 160.

Honors Concentration in Social Thought The School of Humanities and the School of Social Sciences offer an honors concentration in Social Thought. The concen\u00ad tration offers undergraduates the opportunity to examine major social theories and their implications in a systematic and thor- UC IRVINE - 1981-1982132 SPECIAL HUMANITIES PROGRAMS ough way. In exploring the intellectual foundations and contem\u00ad porary development of modern social thought, students will develop their skills in critical analysis of society and theory. The concentration identifies whole societies as its objects of knowledge. It has as its central focus alternative conceptions of society's structure, historical development, and future prospects as perceived and analyzed by political and sociar philosophers, historians, social scientists, and literary writers. The concentration is taken in addition to a major in the School of Humanities or the School of Social Sciences. Thus, a student would major in, e.g., History and Social Thought or Political Science and Social Thought. Students interested in this program should apply to a member of the faculty steering committee. A student is admitted to the program on the recommendation of the steering committee. Students are selected on the basis of aptitude for theory. A grade point average of at least 3.2 is required for admission, and in order to complete the honors program a grade point average of at least 3.5 must be attained in courses in the Social Thought concentration. Two core courses, two courses in surveys of theory, and two courses in intensive studies of theorists will be required. Addi\u00ad tional proble!Jl-centered courses will be recommended. Lists of courses in these categories and of the current membership of the steering committee may be obtained from the Social Sci\u00ad ences Advising Office or the Office of Undergraduate Study in the School of Humanities. A senior honors thesis is required. Concentration in Women's Studies The Women's Studies concentration is not a major but is intended to allow a student to complement any major in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology by studying systematically women in culture and society. The student will follow an interdisciplinary course of study designed in consultation with a faculty advisor from the Women's Studies Committee. In addition to the two\u00ad quarter upper-division core courses (Humanities 155A-B), the concentration also includes two courses each in the social sci\u00ad ences or social ecology, and the humanities. This will ensure that students acquire at least two different methodologies. Undergraduate Courses The following set of courses has no necessary relation to the undergraduate major in Humanities. The courses are, of course, open to any UCI student. Humanities lA-B-Cis required for the major in Humanities, as it is a requirement of any student majoring in the School of Humanities.

PROGRAM IN LINGUISTICS Bernard Tranel, Ph.D. University of California, San Diego, Director of the Program and Associate Professor of French and Linguistics Richard Barrutia, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Spanish and Linguistics (currently Education Abroad Program Director in Madrid) Peter Colaclides, Ph.D. University of Athens, Professor of Classics Mary Ritchie Key, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Linguistics Tracy D. Terrell, Ph.D. University of Texas, Associate Professor of Span- ish and Linguistics Owen Thomas, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Professor of Linguistics, English, and Education Wilfried M. Voge, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Lecturer in German and Linguistics (See also the School of Social Sciences for additional faculty in Linguistics.) Linguistics is concerned with descriptions of human languages, with theories that seek to explain the nature of language, and with the various uses of language. Additionally, linguistics has potential relationships with other disciplines concerned with language. Because of the various possibilities in emphasis, the programs are highly flexible. The undergraduate major in Linguistics is offered by the School of Humanities and by the School of Social Sciences. The UCI campus programs are administered by an inter-School Linguis\u00ad tics Committee. Students are able to select a Linguistics major in either School according to their interests. . There are three ways to major in Linguistics as an undergradu\u00ad ate. They are designated as Tracks I, II, and III. Track I, General Linguistics, will appeal to students who wish to receive a broad introduction to the major subfields of Linguis\u00ad tics. Track I may be taken either through the School of Social Sciences or through the School of Humanities. Track II, Theoretical and Fonnal Linguistics, will appeal to stu\u00ad dents in the cognitive sciences. Track II is available through the School of Social Sciences. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982134 LINGUISTICS Track Ill, Applied Linguistics (Language Teaching and English as a Second Language), will appeal to students interested in lan\u00ad guage teaching including but not limited to the teaching of Eng\u00ad lish as a second language. Track III is available through the School of Humanities. Students may also major in Classics, French, German, and Spanish with an emphasis in Linguistics. Students are encouraged to consider a double major in Linguis\u00ad tics and either English or a foreign language. This is especially recommended for students following Track III. Students who double major may not satisfy requirements in one major with courses which count for the other major, unless the same course is required for both majors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: See page 110. Program Requirements Track I General Linguistics I. Linguistics 50. 2. Two courses in each of the following Core Groups: A-Phonetics and Phonology Topics (150-159) Note that Linguistics 110 and 120 are prerequisites for many of the courses offered in their respective groups and should be taken as soon as possible. Track II Theoretical and Formal Linguistics Consult requirements of the School of Social Sciences. Track III Applied Linguistics (Language teaching and English as a second language) The following are required courses: Linguistics 50, 110, 111, 120, 132, 140, 158. In addition, the student will select any other five courses from the following list (or others with the prior approval of the advisor): Linguistics 112, 142, 146, 150, 152, 154. All students who major in Linguistics within the School of Humanities will also take a single year of a foreign language other than the one used to satisfy the Humanities language requirement. Students are strongly urged to study a non-Indo\u00ad European language (such as Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Swahili) whenever available. Courses 50 Introduction to Linguistics ( 4) F, W, S.

Each discipline inevitably poses problems con\u00ad cerning the nature of the standards appropriate to it and the place of its subject matter within the total framework of human knowledge. If we are to understand science or art or literature, or such human practices as morality and religion, we are bound to address ourselves to philosophiCal issues relating to their nature, the uses of reason appropriate to them, and the contri\u00ad butions they make to our understanding and appreciation of ourselves and the world in which we live. Undergraduate Program Instruction in philosophy relies essentially upon discussion in which students are active participants. Wherever possible, therefore, classes are severely limited in size in order to permit sustained dialogues between student and instructor .. Some of the courses offered are of general interest to all stu\u00b7 dents. Others are designed to explore issues that arise in selected and special disciplines. Among these are courses in the UC IRVINE - 1981-1982136 PHll.OSOPHY philosophy of science and of art. The staff should be consulted for advice about courses best suited to the specialized needs of particular students. The program of course offerings is also designed for those majors in philosophy whose intention may be either to enter some professional school upon graduation (e.g., law) or to engage in graduate work in philosophy. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: See page 110. Departmental Requirements Philosophy 50, Philosophy 20 and 22 and either 21 or 23; two of the following: Philosophy 100A-B; 110A-B; 115A-B; two additional quarter courses from Philosophy 101-199. Graduate Program Students are encouraged to seek the council of any and all members of the Department whose recommendations the stu\u00ad dent would deem helpful. It is hoped that there will be a close intellectual relationship between graduate students and profes\u00ad sors in order to provide the students with optimum conditions for philosophical development and to expedite their progress toward advanced degrees. In addition, the Department sponsors a series of colloquia each year. Participation in these colloquia is an important part of the graduate student's training. Every new graduate student is assigned a committee of faculty members whose purpose is to oversee the student's progress through the major requirements for the advanced degree. The student consults with the committee each quarter about pro\u00ad gress and any administrative or academic difficulties. Each stu\u00ad dent's overall record is evaluated by the Department each year, customarily during the first two weeks of March. When the student has satisfied residency, language, logic, and portfolio requirements, the Candidacy Committee supervises the qualify\u00ad ing examination and the development of a dissertation project, and the. subsequent writing of the dissertation itself. The Chair of this committee is the principal person with whom the gradu\u00ad ate student will consult on the dissertation. Master of Arts in Philosophy There is no list of courses required for the M.A. degree. The M.A. program in Philosophy takes one year at a minimum. The student may elect to follow either of the following routes to the degree: write a thesis on a subject to be chosen in consultation with an advisor and defend the thesis in an oral examination, OT satisfy the Logic and Portfolio requirements for the Ph.D. (see below). Please refer to the Graduate Studies and Research sec\u00ad tion for information on the minimum number of courses required for the M.A. degree. Advancement to candidacy for the M.A. degree is not auto\u00ad matic, but requires formal application to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research via the Philosophy Department Office. Application must be made with the recommendation of the Phi\u00ad losophy Department and must take place before the beginning of the quarter in which the student expects to receive the degree. Doctor of Philosophy in Philosophy There is no set number of courses required for the Ph.D., thus allowing course work to be tailored to the individual student's needs and interests. However, as a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree, every student is required to have some experience in teaching. The Ph.D. program is designed to take four years for the nor\u00ad mally qualified student. In exceptional cases it may be possible to obtain the degree within three years. A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. The following five items are re\u00ad quirements for the Ph.D. degree. Tools of research, to be satisfied by demonsttating proficiency in a single appropriate foreign language* or by passing with a grade of B or better five to six courses at the graduate level in a discipline or disciplines outside of the Philosophy Department. Approval for the latter alternative will be granted by the Department only if, in its judgment, the courses form an inte\u00ad grated unit in light of the student's research interest. Logic, to be satisfied by 1) passing Philosophy 151 with a grade of B or better, or passing an examination prepared by the Department on equivalent material, and 2) passing with a grade of B or better one course in a mathematically rigorous subject that requires the student to carry out detailed mathematical proofs of significant theorems. Examples of such subjects are: Proof Theory, Model Theory, Probability Theory, Game The\u00ad ory, Mathematical Linguistics, Topology, Classical Mechanics, Relativity Theory, etc. Philosophy 153 will satisfy this portion of the requirement. Other courses will satisfy it only with the approval of the Department. Portfolio of papers representing the student's best work in phi\u00ad losophy. The papers may be, or may be based upon, essays writ\u00ad ten for course work. The topics of the papers will cover four fields in philosophy as well as at least three of the following his\u00ad torical periods: Ancient, Medieval, Early Modern, Kant and Nineteenth Century, and Twentieth Century. Examples of fields in philosophy are metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, aes\u00ad thetics, and so on. Papers will be evaluated by the faculty for the purpqse of determining whether or not the student is ready to seek admission to candidacy. Advancement to candidacy ana the writing of a thesis. Upon successful completion of the above requirements, the student will apply for advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree by filling out the appropriate forms and returning them to the Philosophy Department Office. A Candidacy Committee including one or two members from an academic area outside of Philosophy is then appointed by the Graduate Council. This *The foreign language examinations are administered by the Depart\u00ad ment of Philosophy. They are two hours in length and consist of translating, with the aid of a dictionary, passages from two authors. Students wishing information as to courses to prepare them for these examinations and dates when these examinations will be given should consult the Philosophy Department Office, 500 Humanities Office Building, (714) 833-6526. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Committee administers an oral Qualifying Examination to determine whether the student is qualified to begin work de\u00ad signed to lead to the completion of a thesis. Upon passing this oral examination, the student becomes a can\u00ad didate for the Ph.D. degree. The Doctoral Committee appointed by the Graduate Council supervises the student's further course work and research, as well as the actual writing of the doctoral thesis. . The defense of the thesis. At a suitable point during the development of the thesis, the Doctoral Committee administers an oral examination, the focus of which is the content of the thesis itself. If at all possible, this examination will be given while the student is still in residence. Undergraduate Courses 5 Problems of Philosophy ( 4) F, W, S.

PROGRAM IN RUSSIAN Helen Wei!, M.A. California State University, San Diego, Director of the ProgTam and Lecturer in Russian (Russian language and method\u00ad ology; contemporary Soviet prose; Russian culture twentieth-century Russian literature) Mark Altshuller, Ph.D. Leningrad State University, Lecturer in Russian (eighteenth-century Russian literature; golden age of Russian litera\u00b7 ture; history of Russian culture; Pushkin, his times, works, and life; modern Russian prose) UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Guy de Mallac, Ph.D. Cornell University, ProfessO'Y of Russian (modem Russian literature; comparative literature; literature and society; Russian intellectual thought; Pasternak's life and work) Elena Dryzhakova, Ph.D. Leningrad State Pedagogical Institute, Lecturer in Russian (nineteenth-century Russian literature; Dostoevsky, his life and works; Herzen, his life and works; history of Russian and Soviet poetry; theory of poetry) Michael A. Green, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Assist\u00ad ant ProfessO'Y of Russian (Russian symbolist theater; relations between literature and the arts; eighteenth-century Russian theater, painting, and music) Russian is .a language spoken by 240 million people in the Soviet Union and ranks with English and Chinese as one of the three major world languages. Russian is a language of the Indo\u00ad European family and is thus related to English, French, and German. Russian is an infinitely rich language, as is English, and adapts itself well to a variety of styles and genres from lyric love poetry to the seeming harshness and brashness of the futurist poets. For the first two years, the Program in Russian emphasizes a combination of speaking, writing, and reading skills. At the end of the senior year, the student can expect to have attained a rather high level of proficiency in all language skills-reading, writing, speaking, and understanding. By then students will have read a number of selected literary texts-including a fair portion of the significant masterworks-in the original. They will also have familiarized themselves with some of the historical back\u00ad ground of the language and with its relation to other Slavic and European languages. And they will have achieved a reasonable degree of familiarity with the major cultural and social trends in Russian history. In addition to the regular Russian major with emphasis on lan\u00ad guage and literature, the Program in Russian offers a modified major with emphasis on linguistics. This major was designed for those students who have no plans to pursue advanced study in Russian literature, while they wish to focus on the study of the structure of Russian viewed within the framework of Slavic and general linguistics. The Program in Russian also offers a major with an emphasis in Russian civilization, which is geared to the interests of students who do not intend to specialize in Russian language and litera\u00ad ture. This emphasis is based upon a multidisciplinary approach (through language, the arts, literature, history, study of institu\u00ad tions) to the rich variety of a culture that both before the Revo\u00ad lution and during the Soviet period has made an important con\u00ad tribution to mankind's heritage and endeavors. Various speciali\u00ad zations and challenging new career possibilities in today's world are available to students electing this option. The Self-Paced Program: lOA-B-C/llA-B-C During the regular academic year, the Program in Russian offers students a self-paced option in the first and second years of lan\u00ad guage study. The Self-Paced Program is designed to accommo\u00ad date students who cannot attend regular class meetings, or who wish to progress toward language competence at their own pace (please see 10A-B-C and llA-B-C). Students .interested in en\u00ad rolling in the Self-Paced Program should contact the Director of the Program in Russian. RUSSIAN 139 Students planning to major in Russian should obtain a copy of the brochure \"Russian Language, Literature, and Civilization at UCI\" from the Office of the Program in Russian. Students entering UCI with previous training in Russian will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Russian will enroll in Russian lB, 1C, 2A, and 2B respectively. Exceptions to this ruling can be made but must have the ap\u00ad proval of the Program Director. Students with high school train\u00ad ing in Russian should consult with the Russian staff before en\u00ad rolling in Russian courses. UCI Summer Russian Institute and Practicum In planning their programs of study, students should note that certain courses bearing the designation Summer are also offered within the-three-week UCI Russian Institute and Practi\u00ad cum (Russian 1A-B-C, 101A-B, 199, 220, 290, and 398). The UCI Russian Language Institute is a three\u00ad week, total-immersion program in Russian language and culture for students of all levels, conducted entirely in Russian and encompassing all of the student's daily activities. The Practicum adjunct of the Institute affords prospective and practicing lan\u00ad guage teachers an opportunity for intensive language review and participation in established and experimental teaching methods.

Departmental Requirements Russian Major with Emphasis on Literature: Russian 180; Linguistics 50; 110; 120; Russian 123A-B-C, Social Sciences 122A, Russian 160, 180. Planning a Program of Study The Program in Russian believes in close consultation with stu\u00ad dents on academic advising, program planning, and discussion of goals and direction. Students planning to major in Russian with an emphasis on literature or on linguistics are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty as early as possi\u00ad ble, in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the various programs. After indicating an intention to major in Russian, the student is assigned to an academic advisor who will help in the task of selecting courses toward the completion of one of the three UC IRVINE - 1981-1982140RUSSIAN options open to students majoring in Russian studies at UCI. Special attention is paid to the unique aspects of the Russian field. In particular, students' attention is alerted to the com\u00ad bined academic and career implications and potentialities of these major options. Career Opportunities The major in Russian may lead to the following careers: in edu\u00ad cation (in high school teaching, or, after appropriate graduate study, on the college and university levels); with the Federal Government (where there are a number of openings in such agencies as the Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Informa\u00ad tion Office, and the Library of Congress for translators and other positions requiring the knowledge of Russian); a career as interpreter or translator with private institutions; various careers in science and technology; library science; communica\u00ad tions media (thus, the United States Information Agency's Voice of America offers many opportunities for Russian speak\u00ad ers: research, scriptwriting, editing, translating, and announc\u00ad ing); careers in private business corporations. However, it is not the essential purpose of a major program in Russian language, literature, and civilization to provide specific vocational skills. The study of Russian language, literature, and civilization is primarily viewed as a valuable component of a lib\u00ad eral education; a knowledge of Russian literature, history, philos\u00ad ophy, and science provides an extremely important instrument for the investigation and appreciation of the modern world. Since Russian is second only to English as a world language of science, the study of the Russian language provides access to a vast corpus of scholarly, scientific, and technical literature. Lower ..

Students are placed in Spanish courses according to their years of previous study and a placement test. In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. All.courses in Spanish and Portuguese, unless specifically stated, are taught in the foreign language. By the end of the first year, students attain mastery of the basic structure of the language and ability to converse on everyday topics as well as to read and write on an elementary plane. Self-instructional courses in both Spanish and Portuguese are also available. -In the second year, emphasis is put on gradually raising the level of the student's ability to read and write. A third-year course of two quarters stresses composition as opposed to translation. Further, a course in phonetics perfects pronunciation, intro\u00ad duces theoretical considerations, and presents historical and dia\u00ad lect variants of Spanish. The introductory courses in literature, also in the third year, emphasize the analysis and appreciation of complete literary works by genre rather than the study of many short selections of innumerable authors in an anthology. The courses in Hispanic civilization combine a panoramic overview with a close look at a specific country or topic. Although no major in Portuguese is offered, advanced literature courses are available. Students are encouraged to participate in programs of study abroad during the suminer and the junior year. Elected representatives of the undergraduate majors, the gradu\u00ad ate students, and the Teaching Assistants participate with full voting rights in Department meetings. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: See page 110. Departmental Requirements Spanish lOA-B, 11, 101A-B-C; 110A, B, or C. In addition, the student will choose one or more of the following emphases: Literature and Culture: Seven upper-division courses in literature with a minimum of one in Spanish-American litera\u00ad ture. Two courses in Hispanic culture and civilization may be substituted if desired. Linguistics: Linguistics 50, 110, 120; Spanish 113 and any three upper-division or graduate Spanish linguistics courses such as 100A-B-C, 186, 200, 201, 204, 205. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982l4Z SPANISH AND PORTIJGUESE Bilingualism and English as a Second Language: Spanish 100A (Multiple Subject), or 100B (Single Subject), Spanish 100C (ESL methods); one course in Chicano literature, one course in Chicano culture, Spanish 113, and two upper-division courses in literature at least one of which must be Latin Ameri\u00ad can literature. (Education 140A-B-C is the same as Spanish 100A-B-C.) For students who plan to teach Spanish, the following courses are strongly recommended: Linguistics 50, Linguistics 140 (Second Language Acquisition), Spanish 113 (Spanish Linguis\u00ad tics). Also, Spanish 200 and Spanish 204 should be taken as seniors or as members of the credential program. Master of Arts in Spanish The candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our under\u00ad graduate major. The student takes a minimum of 11 courses, eight of which must be at the graduate level. Two of the 11 courses must be in linguistics. Spanish 239, Methods of Literary Criticism, is required of all literature majors. A maximum of two courses may be transferred from another university, but a maximum of five from another University of California cam\u00ad pus. Proficiency (defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C) in a foreign language other than the major language is required. The comprehensive examination, in part written, in part oral, will be based both on a reading list and the courses taken by the students and will also test the stu\u00ad dents' ability to express themselves correctly in Spanish. No thesis is required. The student may choose an emphasis in liter\u00ad ature or linguistics. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than three years of graduate study. M.A. students are advised by a faculty member in their field of specialization. Normally only students who are studying for the Ph.D. are admitted to the graduate program. The comprehensive examination for the. M.A. may be accepted as the written portion of the qualifying examination for the Ph.D. M.A.T. in Spanish This program is specifically directed at meeting the needs of working credentialed teachers, although others may apply. It seeks to provide a group of modern, relevant courses that will enable teachers to keep abreast of recent developments in their field. It is stuctured so that working teachers can take courses in late afternoons, evenings, and summers, and may be completed in one academic year and two summer sessions. Applicants should have a B.A. in Spanish and should acquire proficiency in a foreign language other than Spanish. The program consists of 10 courses (eight of which must be at the graduate level) as fol\u00ad lows: three courses in Hispanic literature; three courses in His\u00ad panic civilization and literature; three courses in Hispanic lin\u00ad guistics; and one course in Recent Trends in Foreign Language Teaching, to be combined with a curricular research project or a thesis. M.A.T. students are counseled by a faculty member in the Department. Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis The bilingual/ cross-cultural emphasis is a specialization in addi\u00ad tion to the regular teaching credential for high sch601 (Single Subject) or elementary school (Multiple Subject). Undergradu-ates may plan from the beginning to aim for this emphasis by preparing themselves with a proficiency in the Spanish language. See page 236. Ph.D. in Spanish The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a Ph.D. degree with a major in either Spanish or Spanish-American literature. The program attempts to integrate period and genre studies with work in literary theory, linguistics, and socio\u00ad historical studies. A number of courses outside of the Depart\u00ad ment are required. We thereby hope to aid in the formation of Ph.D. candidates who are not narrow specialists but rather scholars acquainted with the various fields that relate to their discipline. We are concerned also with the practical aspects pf helping our graduates become good teachers. The minor field can be Spanish literature, Spanish-American literature, Spanish linguistics, literary theory, comp~rative litera\u00ad ture, or a non-Hispanic literature. Language Requirements A reading knowledge of Portuguese and other languages rele\u00ad vant to the student's area of specialization is required. The choice of language requires Department approval. Course Requirements A minimum of 23 courses is required for the Ph.D. as follows: A. Two graduate courses in linguistics, diachronic and syn\u00ad chronic (the students who select Linguistics as a minor will substitute two courses in either Spanish or Spanish-. American literature); a course in literary theory (genre studies, etc.); a course in methods of literary criticism; a course on the socio-historical context of the period of tli.e student's specialization; a course in Brazilian or Portuguese literature (preferably related to the student's specialization); two courses outside of the Department in non-lberic litera\u00ad tures; two courses in Spanish or Spanish-American litera\u00ad ture, whichever is not the major. Ph.D. candidates should take one course in each genre within their area. B. Additional courses for the major and the minor: 1. Ten courses in the major. Those students who major in twentieth-century Spanish-American literature are required to take Spanish 238A-B: Spanish-American Literature in the Colonial Period and in the Nineteenth Century. 2. Three courses in the minor. Candidates who have the M.A. degree from another university will be interviewed by two professors representing peninsular and Spanish-American literature, in order to evaluate their past studies in terms of our doctoral program; it is recommended that the student's graduate advisor direct the doctoral disserta\u00ad tion and that the choice of dissertation and director be made as early as possible. Each incoming graduate student will be as\u00ad signed a faculty advisor who will supervise the student's pro\u00ad gram and with whom the student should meet at least once each quarter. All graduate students will be formally evaluated at the end of each year by the faculty with whom they have studied. Students pursuing a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within five years or less. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Teaching Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, all Ph.D. candidates without previous teaching experience are required to teach under supervision and at UCI one course in each of three quarters. All Ph.D. students will student,teach in an upper,division course related to the major. This will count as one of the required courses in the major. Comprehensive Examination The student is admitted to candidacy by passing, by a majority vote, an oral examination administered by a Candidacy Com, mittee appointed by the Graduate Council. The Candidacy Committee is composed of five members, of whom four will be from the Department. The oral examination will be preceded by a written examination as follows: A. Choice The student, in consultation with the Doctoral Committee, may choose one of the following options: 1. A comprehensive examination including a dissertation project. The student will then take parts 1, 2, and 3 of the examination described below, and will submit a dis, sertation project. 2. A comprehensive examination including the minor instead of the dissertation project, part 4 of the examina, tion described below. B. The written comprehensive examination will consist of three parts: 1. A genre in all periods. The student will demonstrate knowledge of literary theory and methods of literary criticism. 2. A historical literary period, including all of the genres and the soci~historical context. 3. Textual analysis. A representative text in the student's genre of specialization will be given to the student at the time of the examination. If the genre is poetry, the text may be a complete poem or a section from a larger poem. In the case of the short story, novel, theatre, or essay, a relatively brief organic section will constitute the text. The student's analysis should be intrinsic; it should also demonstrate the relationship of the text to the total work as well as to the author's total production and the author's position in the literary history of the country or the continent. 4. Dissertation project. During the year preceding the com, prehensive exams, the student will write a dissertation project of approximately 40 typewritten ( double,spaced) pages which will be turned in one month before the com, prehensive exams. The topic as well as the dissertation advisor will be chosen by the student. The essay should: a. Define clearly the topic of the dissertation and justify it by discussing its significance. it b. Discuss previous studies on this topic and prove the originality of the new study. SPANISH AND PORlUGUESE 143 c. Describe and justify the critical method to be followed. d. Include a bibliography of special, general, and theoret, ical works. Dissertation A dissertation topic will be chosen by the candidate and nor, rnally, but not necessarily, will fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. \u00b7 Three faculty members appointed by the Graduate Council will constitute the Doctoral Committee which supervises the prepa, ration and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doc, toral Committee supervises a final examination, the focus of which is the content of the dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will not be given after the dissertation is com, pleted, but rather at an appropriate point during its develop, ment. Such final examination normally will be given while the graduate student is in residence at UCI. The Doctoral Commit, tee certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signatures of the individual Committee members on the tide page.

UC IRVINE - 1981-1982SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES Myron Bander Dean The School of Physical Sciences offers both professional train\u00ad ing and general education in the Departments of Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics. The faculty, active in research and graduate education, are at the same time vitally concerned with undergraduate teaching. Curricula of the School are designed to meet the needs of a wide variery of students ranging from those with little technical background who seek insight into the activi\u00ad ties and accomplishments of physical scientists to those seeking a comprehensive understanding that will prepare them for crea\u00ad tive research in physical science. Over the course of the past century and a half, physics, chemis\u00ad try, and mathematics have evolved into interdependent but separate intellectual disciplines. This development is reflected in the departmental structure of the School of Physical Sciences. In the same period, these fundamental disciplines have moved into domains of abstraction unimagined by early scientists. This trend to abstraction with its concomitant increase in under\u00ad standing of the physical universe provides the major challenge to the student of the physical sciences. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry, while providing the foundation of the technol\u00ad ogy that dominates contemporary civilization, underlie to an ever-increasing extent the new developments in the biological and social sciences. PHYSICAL SCIENCES 145 In recognition of the contribution students can make to the academic affairs of the School, a variety of responsibilities on School and departmental committees is given to undergraduate and graduate students. Degrees Chemistry .............................. Honors Criteria used by .the School of Physical Sciences in selecting candidates for honors at graduation are as follows: Approxi\u00ad mately 1 percent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. Honors are awarded on the basis of a student's performance in research and cum\u00ad mulative grade point average. The School of Physical Sciences also grants special honors to students who have distinguished themselves by their work in their major subject. Undergraduate Programs Each department offers courses that are of value to nonmajors and majors in the sciences. The programs for majors are designed to meet the needs of students planning careers in busi\u00ad ness or industry, of students planning advanced professional study, and of students planning graduate work that continues their major interest. Introductory courses in chemistry, mathe\u00ad matics, and physics meet the needs of students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering and are also appropriate for students in othe~ disciplines who seek a rigorous introduc- UC IRVINE - 1981-1982146 PHYSICAL SCIENCES tion to the physical sciences. In addition, a number of courses within the School have few or no prerequisites and are directed particularly toward students majoring in areas remote from the sciences. Planning a Program of Study Every undergraduate student who has chosen to major in Physi\u00ad cal Sciences is assigned a faculty advisor. The name of this ad\u00ad visor is communicated to the student prior to enrollment or may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean or of the appropriate Department Chair. Students are free to change academic advisors at any time. Each department also has a Chief Academic Advisor who is responsible for interpreting degree requirements and dealing with special advising problems. An academic advising and counseling staff is also employed in the ~ Associate Dean's Office and is available to serve a broad range of student advising needs. In consultation with the advisor the student should plan a course of study leading to a major in one of the departments of the School. In carrying out this major, the student may often concentrate very heavily in a second department within the School or in some other school. Occa\u00ad sionally students choose to pursue a double major. Permission to do so may be sought by a petition submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean of Physical Sciences. All initial courses of study for majors include mathematics through calculus, and calculus is a prerequisite for much of the upper-division work in each major. A student interested in any of the physical sciences should continue mathematical training beyond these prerequisite courses. Furthermore, students interested in either physics or chemistry will usually include work in both of these subjects in their undergraduate careers. Students in the physical sciences are urged to acquire a working knowledge of computer programming at an early stage of their university studies. This can be done by taking Information and Computer Science 1, Information and Computer Science 15, or Physics 1. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirments: See page 14. School Requirements In addition to the courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI breadth requirement, students with a major in the School of Physical Sciences are required to take one additional approved three-course group chosen from one of the following breadth categories: Category Ill (Social and Behavioral Sciences); Cate\u00ad gory IV (Humanistic Inquiry); or the Language and Linguistics section of Category V. For purposes of this requirement, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that any three con\u00ad secutive foreign language courses are acceptable. Graduate Programs A program of course work and research leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees is offered in each of the three departments of the School. The individual programs are described in the following announcements of each department. DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY David A. Brant, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Chair of the Depart\u00ad ment and Professor of Chemistry Philip N. Borer, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Assistant Pro\u00ad fessor of Chemistry Marjorie C. Caserio, Ph.D. Bryn Mawr College, Professor of Chemistry A.

Lehigh University, Lecturer in Chemistry Mare Taagepera, Ph.D. University of Pennsylvania, Adjunct Lecturer in Chemistry Robert W. Taft, Ph.D. Ohio State University, Professor of Chemistry Max Wolfsberg, Ph.D. Washington University, Professor of Chemistry Undergraduate Program The major in Chemistry is elected by students planning careers in the chemical sciences and frequently also by those whose CHEMISTRY 147 interests lie in biology, medicine, earth sciences, secondary edu\u00ad cation, business, and law. The curriculum of the Department is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of these students and oth\u00ad ers who may have occasion to study chemistry. The year course Chemistry 1A-B-C (or the two-quarter course Chemistry 61A\u00ad B) is prerequisite to all study in the Department at more ad\u00ad vanced levels. The subject matter of this c.ourse serves also as a thorough introduction to the varied aspects of modern chemis\u00ad try for students who do not wish to pursue their studies beyond this introductory level. Chemistry 51A-B-C is a ope-year sequence in Organic Chemistry which is required for Chemistry majors and for students of the life sciences. Certain more advanced courses required of Chemistry majors may also be of particular interest to the latter groups, among others. The undergraduate program of the Chemistry Department emphasizes close contact with research. Chemistry majors are urged to engage in research under the directio~ of a faculty member. Much of the important chemical literature is being and has been printed in foreign languages, principally German, Russian, and French. Reading competence in one or more of these languages is desirable, and many graduate schools require the demonstra\u00ad tion of such competence as a prerequisite for an advanced degree. Chemistry majors are encouraged to acquire this competence. Chemistry majors who are interested in teaching chemistry at the secondary level are urged to consult with their advisors and with the Office of Teacher Education early in their undergradu\u00ad ate careers. Chemistry majors who plan subsequent study in medical, dental, or other professional schools should request information concerning admission requirements directly from the schools which they seek to enter. Those intending to pursue graduate studies in chemistry should discuss their plans with their academic advisors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: See page 147. Departmental Requirements Basic Requirements: Mathematics 2A-B-C, Physics 5A-B-C and 5LA-LB-LC, Chemistry 1A-B-C 61A-B and 61 LA-LB, Chemistry 51A-B-C and 51LA-LB-LC, Chemistry 107 and 107L, Chemistry 131A-B-C or 130A-B-C, Chemistry 151. Electives: Four courses chosen from the elective list below. These must include at least two courses offered by the Chemis\u00ad try Department (Chemistry 180 may be counted no more than once, and Chemistry 192, 194, 196, and 199 may not be counted) and at least one of the laboratory courses in the fol-/ lowing laboratory course group: Chemistry 152, Chemistry 153, Chemistry 160, Chemistry 170, PhysiCs 150, Physics 151, Physics 152, Physics 153. Elective List: Chemistry 125, 135 and all Chemistry courses numbered 152-235, Bio. Sci. 106 (Biochemistry), Bio. ScL 107 (Molecular Biology), Molecular Biology and Biochemistry UC IRVINE - 1981-1982148 CHEMISfRY 205A-B (Biochemistry), Physics 111A-B (Classical Mechanics), Physics 112A-B (Electromagnetic Theory), Physics 113A-B-C (Quantum Physics), Physics 115 (Statistical Physics), Physics 116 (Thermodynamics), Physics 132 (Nuclear Physics), Physics 133 (Condensed Matter Physics), Physics 134 (Modern Optics), Physics 150 (Electronics for Scientists), Physics 151 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 152 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 153 (Advanced Laboratory). Scientific Breadth Requirements: A total of six additional four-or five-unit courses chosen from the offerings of the Departments of Mathematics and Physics and the School of Biological Sciences. (These may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis subject to the usual restrictions on Pass/Not Pass enrollment.) Planning a Program of Study The departmental requirements leave the student a great deal of latitude in choice of courses; the student can choose to pursue interests ranging from biochemistry on the one hand to chemi\u00ad cal physics on the other. Many of the basic requirements above coincide with those of the School of Biological Sciences, and a double major in Chemistry-Biological Sciences does not require much extra course work. The Department is accredited by the American Chemical Society to offer an undergraduate degree certified by the Society as suitable background for a career in chemistry or for graduate study in chemistry. While it is not necessary, it is desirable for students to pursue a course of study that the American Chemical Society judges to merit a certified degree. A certified degree specifically requires that the following courses be included in the program of study: Physics 5A-B-C; Mathematics 3 (any two quarters); Chemistry 152 and 153; Chemistry 160, 170, or 180. Students should consult with their academic advisors on courses of study. A Chemistry major normally takes Chemistry 1A-B-C and 1LB-LC, Mathematics 2A-B-C, and required writ\u00ad ing courses during the freshman year. The sophomore year should include Chemistry 51A-B-C and 51LA-LB-LC; the Physics 5A-B-C and 5LA-LB-LC sequences should be com\u00ad pleted no later than the fall quarter of the junior year. The bal\u00ad ance of the freshman and sophomore program can be chosen at the student's discretion with consideration given to progress toward completion of the School of Physical Sciences breadth requirement, the UCI breadth requirement, and the Chemistry Department scientific breadth requirement. In the junior year all Chemistry majors should enroll in the year sequence of physical chemistry (Chemistry 131A-B-C or 130A-B-C) and in Chemistry 107 (fall) and 151 (winter). During the junior and senior years the Chemistry Department electives requirement should be fulfilled, as should other University, School, and departmental requirements. There is no foreign language requirement, but Chemistry majors are urged to obtain reading competence in a foreign language through course work. Outlines of several typical programs of study for Chemistry majors, American Chemical Society-certified Chemistry majors, and Chemistry-Biological Sciences double majors hav!! been prepared. Students are urged to obtain copies of the sample programs from their academic advisors, from the Chemistry Department Office, or from the Physical Sciences Associate Dean's Office. Graduate Program The Department offers graduate programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemistry. The Ph.D. degree is granted in recognition of breadth and depth of knowledge of the facts and theories.of modern chemistry and an ability to carry out inde\u00ad pendent chemical research demonstrated through submission of an acceptable doctoral dissertation. The M.S. degree may be earned either through submission of an acceptable Master's thesis (Plan I) or through an approved program of graduate course work (Plan II). A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for admission to the Ph.D. program. Upon entering the graduate programs all students are required to take a series of Area Examinations which test the students' competence in the general areas of chemistry, e.g., organic, physical, inorganic, at the undergraduate level. The Area Exam\u00ad inations are designed to ensure a proper fundamental level of preparation for graduate study and are used as a guide in choos\u00ad ing the appropriate program of course work for each entering student. Students in the Ph.D. program are expected to demonstrate their knowledge of chemistry at the advanced level through satisfactory completion of a series of Cumulative Examinations. These examinations are designed to encourage the independent study of chemistry through reading of the classic and current chemical literature and attendance at advanced seminars and colloquia. Normally, beginning with the second year of graduate study, students must take the monthly examinations until four have been passed. This requirement must be satisfied within 12 consecutive Cumulative Examinations. Following completion of the Cumulative Examination require\u00ad ment, participants in the Ph.D. program take an oral examina\u00ad tion for formal Advancement to Candidacy. This examination normally comes in a student's third graduate year and consists of an oral defense before a faculty committee of the student's dissertation research project and a second original research prop\u00ad osition conceived, developed, and documented by the student. The committee may examine the student at this time on any subject it deems relevant to the independent pursuit of chemical research. Students in the Ph.D. and M.S. Plan I (Thesis) programs are required to complete a minimum of seven approved courses, including six graduate-level courses in chemistry. The M.S. Plan II (Course Work) program requires that the student complete 10 graduate-level chemistry courses. Graduate students are expected to maintain a grade point average of B or better to remain in good academic standing. Training in teaching is an integral part of each graduate pro\u00ad gram, and all graduate degree candidates are expected to partici\u00ad pate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate career. The most important component of the Ph.D. program is the doctoral dissertation, which must describe the results of origi\u00ad nal research performed by the student under the supervision of a faculty member of the Department. The criterion for accepta\u00ad bility of the dissertation is that its contents be of a quality suit\u00ad able for publication in a scientific journal of high editorial standards. Each Ph.D. candidate is expected to present the work described in the completed dissertation in a seminar before the Department, following which the candidate will be examined in UC IRVINE - 1981-1982public on the contents of the dissertation by a committee of the faculty. A Master's thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the M.S. under Plan I must also describe the results of a student's original research performed under the direction of a faculty member. However, no public oral defense of the Master's thesis is required. Residency requirements specify a minimum of six quarters in residence at UCI for Ph.D. candidates and three quarters for M.S. candidates. Some faculty from the Department of Chemistry are members of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. The program provides an opportunity for interaction among graduate students and faculty from a number of UCI departments who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together monthly to discuss research problems of mutual inter\u00ad est, and a regular series of interdisciplinary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide formal instruction in areas encompassed by biophysics and biophysical chemistry. See page 75. The following lists specify requirements for each of the graduate programs offered by the Department of Chemistry. Master of Science in Chemistry Plan I (Thesis Plan) Completion of the Area Examination requirement. Completion of a minimum of seven approved courses, includ\u00ad ing six graduate-level courses in chemistry (as specified by the Department and excluding Chemistry 280, 290, and 291) with maintenance of an average grade of B or better in all course work undertaken.

Williams, Ph.D. Brandeis University, Associate Professor of Mathematics UC IRVINE - 1981-1982The Department of Mathematics is engaged in teaching and fundamental research in a wide variety of basic mathematical disciplines. Its activity is reflected in undergraduate and gradu\u00ad ate courses which are responsive to new developments at the research frontier and the ever-changing requirements of government, industry, and education. The Department of Mathematics offers undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to fashion a thorough and soundly based program of study leading to professional competence in mathematical research, or in an area of application. The curriculum in mathematics includes opportunities for supervised individual study and research, and is augmented by seminars and colloquia. It is designed to be compatible with curricular structures at other collegiate institutions in California in order to enable students transferring to UCI to continue their programs of mathematics study. The Department maintains an LSI-11-based minicomputer and a number of programmable calculators that are available for student and faculty use and that supplement the campus Computing Facility. Undergraduate Program Undergraduate mathematics courses are of several kinds: courses preparatory to advanced work in mathematics, the exact sciences, and engineering; courses for students of the social and biological sciences; and courses for liberal arts students and those planning to enter the teaching field.

UC IRVINE - 1981-1982154 MA'IHEMATICS Graduate Program Graduate courses are designed to meet the needs of students doing graduate work in mathematics and in those disciplines that require graduate-level mathematics for their study. Among the fields covered are analysis, algebra, functional analysis, geometry and topology, probability and statistics, ordinary and partial differential equations, and mathematical logic. In addition to formal courses, there are seminars for advanced study toward the Ph.D. in various fields of mathematics. Topics will vary from year to year. Each seminar is conducted by a staff member specializing in the subject studied. Enrollment will be subject to the approval of the instructor in charge. Master of Science in Mathematics The Master's program serves a dual purpose. For some students it will be a terminal program of mathematics education; for others it will lead to study and research at the doctoral level. To earn the Master of Science degree, the student must satisfy course, language, and residency requirements, and pass a com\u00ad prehensive examination administered by the Graduate Studies Committee of the Department. The general course requirement is satisfactory completion of 12 upper-division or graduate courses ( 48 units), at least eight of which (32 units) must be at the graduate level (200 series courses). The specific requirements of the three concentrations (Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Applied Statistical Mathematics) are described below. Each concentration has a core of nine courses, in each of which the student must earn a grade of B (3.0) or better. A grade point average of at least B (3.0) is required for all courses applicable to the M.S. degree. The student's selection of alternative or elective courses must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. The nine required core courses for the Pure Mathematics con\u00ad centration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, Mathematics 220A-B-C, and Mathematics 230A-B-C. The student must complete three additional approved courses, one of which must be an appropri\u00ad ate course offered by a department other than Mathematics. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematics concentration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, Mathematics 220A or 230A; Statistics (Mathematics 131A-B-C or 201A-B-C) or Differential Equations (Mathematics 142A-B-C or 295A-B-C), plus two additional graduate courses in Mathematics. The stu\u00ad dent must complete three additional approved courses, includ\u00ad ing two appropriate courses offered by a department other than Mathematics. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematical Statistics concentration are Mathematics 201A-B-C, Mathemat\u00ad ics 202, Mathematics 204A-B, and three additional approved graduate courses in Mathematics or an appropriate applied.area. The student also must complete Mathematics 129A-B-C. Ordinarily, the final examinations in the courses listed below will comprise the comprehensive examination for the Master's degree. Pure Mathematics: Mathematics 210C, Mathematics 220C, and Applied 142C or 295C. Applied Mathematical Statistics: Mathematics 201C, Mathematics 202, and Mathematics 204B. The student must satisfy the language requirement for the Mas\u00ad ter's degree by demonstrating reading proficiency in French, German, or Russian; or by demonstrating programming pro\u00ad ficiency in one higher level programming language. The residency requirement for the Master's degree ordinarily is satisfied by full-time enrollment for three quarters immediately preceding the award of the M.S. degree. When appropriate, a Leave of Absence may be granted between matriculation and the final quarters of study. Ph.D. in Mathematics To be admitted to the doctoral program in Mathematics, an applicant must have completed a Master's degree in Mathemat\u00ad ics with distinction. When accepted into the doctoral program, the student embarks on a program of formal courses, seminars, and individual study courses to prepare for the Ph.D. qualifying examination and dis\u00ad sertation. A candidate for the Ph.D. should have both breadth and depth of knowledge. Breadth is demonstrated by advanced knowledge and competence in algebra and analysis. Depth of knowledge is demonstrated by profound familiarity with a well\u00ad defined subject in mathematics, e.g., Banach algebras, categori\u00ad cal algebra, group theory, operator theory, probability theory, or topology. After an appropriate period of advanced study, the Graduate Studies Committee will invite the student to prepare for the qualifying examination (or recommend that the student with\u00ad draw from the program). This decision will be reached after consultation with the student's faculty advisor and a review of the instructors' evaluations of the student's performance in courses and seminars. To prepare for the qualifying examina\u00ad tion, the student should study, in depth, two topics selected with the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. The oral qualifying examination is conducted by a candidacy committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council, including at least one member of the faculty outside of the Mathematics Depart\u00ad ment. Following a successful examination, the committee recommends admission of the student to candidacy for the Ph.D. The Ph.D. in Mathematics requires a demonstration of the abil\u00ad ity to read the literature of mathematics in two of these lan\u00ad guages: French, German, or Russian; and the ability to program in a higher level programming language. Teaching experience and training is an integral part of the Ph.D. program. All doctoral students are expected to participate in the teaching program of the Department. The candidate must demonsttate independent, creative research in mathematics by writing and defending a dissertation that makes a new and valuable contribution to mathematics in the / candidate's area of concentration. Following advancement to candidacy, a doctoral committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Council, guides and supervises the candidate's research, study, and writing of the dissertation; conducts an oral defense of the dissertation; and recommends that the Ph.D. be conferred upon approval of the doctoral dissertation.

Physicists study the smallest structure of matter (quarks, nuclei, and atoms); the properties of solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas; the behavior of matter on the grand scale in stars and galaxies; and even the origin and fate of the universe. Other disciplines such as chem\u00ad istry, biology, medicine, and engineering often build upon the foundations laid by physics. In the past century applications of phenomena encountered in the field of physics have led to more changes in our lifestyle thail have occurred in the previous millenium. These changes have brought us a \"high\" standard of living on one hand, and a threat of societal extinction on the other. The knowledge gained in physical studies ha:s affected our daily life, our view of life, our philosophies, and our religions. A subject of so great and general an influence is not only of interest to the specialist but should be understood in its scope, power, and promise for the future by every educated person. The Department offers courses for students of various interests, from those in the liberal arts to those in engineering and other sciences. Faculty members are conducting active research in sev\u00ad eral forefront areas of physical research, and there is student access to specialized research areas such as elementary particles, plasma physics, and condensed matter at both advanced and undergraduate course levels. Instruction varies in approach from traditional lecture courses to seminars at various levels, to independently constructed programs, and ~o experimental com-puter teaching. The faculty is generally young, innovative, and engaged in everything from the traditional activities of research, education, and university service to community action, litera\u00ad ture, and national policy making, to mention a few examples. The Department encourages student-faculty interaction, and faculty members lead the lower-division discussion sections. The Department consists of people committed to intellectual activities and is exciting to those who are so inclined. Undergraduate Program Courses in the Physics Department are designed to meet the needs of many kinds of students, from those students without facility in mathematics whose main interests lie in the humani\u00ad ties or the arts to those students with professional goals in sci\u00ad ence and engineering. In addition to the regular Physics major, a concentration in Applied Physics and a concentration.in Bio\u00ad medical Physics are offered. The three lower-division sequences in physics are distinguished by their intended audience, their mathematical prerequisites, and the extent to which they offer preparation for more advanced courses. These aspects of the beginning courses are summarized in the following table: PHYSICS 3 Premedical students, Biological Sciences majors PHYSICS 5 Intended Audience Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering majors PHYSICS 10-24 Nonscience majors Mathematical Prerequisites Algebra and trigo\u00ad nometry; concurrent enrollment in Math 2 or Math 14 Math 2A (Calcu\u00ad lus); knowledge of computer pro\u00ad gramming is recommended None Preparation for Advanced Courses Physics 5C with permission All upper-division courses in physics None Requirements for Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements: See page 147. Departmental Requirements Physics 5A-B-C-D-E with laboratory; Physics 111A-B, 112A-B, 113A-B, and 115; 150-153); Mathematics 2A7B-C {or H2A-B-C); Mathematics 3A-B-C; 142A-B-C, or 144A-B with Physics 110A-B-C particularly recommended; and three additional coherently related upper-division courses chosen from the Schools of Phys\u00ad ical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineering, or the Depart\u00ad ment of Information and Computer Science. Students should be aware that alternative programs can be developed to meet their special interests and that graduate courses can be used to satisfy undergraduate requirements. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Applied Physics Requirements The requirements of the concentration in Applied Physics include all the requirements of the Physics degree plus six courses in engineering approved by the Physics Department. One quarter of the advanced laboratory requirement may be waived with appropriate engineering laboratory work. Biomedical Physics Requirements The requirements of the concentration in Biomedical Physics include the requirements of the Physics degree, except as noted below, plus the following: Biological Sciences 101, 103, and 104 with associated laboratories; Chemistry lA-B-C with labora\u00ad tory; a three or four quarter sequence of courses in a specific area. Suggested sequences are as follows: 1. Chemistry SlA-B with laboratory; Biological Sciences 106 and 107 2. Biological Sciences lOS plus two psychobiology courses 3. Chemistry 130A-B-C 4. Radiological Sciences 200A-B plus one additional Radiological Science course Approval must be obtained from the program coordinator. Sequences other than those above may be acceptable. The requirement for three additional coherently related upper\u00ad division science courses does not apply to srudents in this concentration. Planning a Program of Study Physics 3 is a one-year course suitable for premedical srudents, srudents majoring in Biological Sciences, and nonscience majors. It surveys most of the important branches of physics with strong orientation toward modem physics. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Nonscience majors with some mathematical skill may wish to consider Physics 3 as an alterna\u00ad tive to Physics 10-24. Sample Programs -Physics PHYSICS 159 A srudent who decides to major in Physics after completing Physics 3 with a grade of A or B may, with the consent of the Departffient, enroll in Physics SC. The premedical physics requirements may be met with Physics 3 or with Physics SA-B-C. Physics S is an intensive five-quarter course for srudents in physics, chemistry, engineering, and other areas interested in a careful quantitative approach to the subject. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Srudents expecting to enroll in the entire five-quarter sequence of Physics S should enroll in Mathematics 3A concurrently with Physics SC. Students plan\u00ad ning to enroll in only three quarters of Physics S need not enroll in Mathematics 3A. The recommended knowledge of computer programming may be gained by enrolling in Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science 1, usually in the fall quarter of the freshman year, or in Physics 1. Biological Sciences majors with facility in calculus should consider Physics S as an alternative to Physics 3. Physics courses numbered between 10 and 24 are general edu\u00ad cation courses intended for nonscience majors. Physics 13A-B is particularly oriented toward students in Social Ecology. The content and format of Physics 21-24 will vary from year to year. In general, these courSes will not include regular labora\u00ad tory work. Courses numbered 110 and above are for Physics majors and other qualified srudents. This series of courses in the upper\u00ad division curriculum is sufficiently broad to provide programs both for the Physics major who does not intend to pursue the srudy of physics beyond the Bachelor's degree level and for the Physics major preparing for a professional career in physics. The Physics major with a career goal in medicine, law, teaching, or business, for example, should emphasize the Physics 130 ser\u00ad ies, which covers most of the important phenomena of physics. The Physics major preparing for graduate work in physics should cover most of the Physics 110 series. Any major who is so inclined can take more than the minimum two quarters of advanced laboratory work. Able srudents may begin the Physics 111 series in their sophomore year. A typical course program for Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate srudy in physics or astronomy is shown below. Three of the electives in the senior year may be physics graduate courses. A srudent with a weak background may want to post\u00ad pone Physics 113A-B-C until the senior year.

Those numbered between 130 and 149 emphasize particular domains of the structure of matter. Laboratory work is assigned to separate courses, 150-153. Transfer students are specifically advised to seek individual con\u00ad sultation with a member of the Physics faculty before deciding on a program of courses. Since many graduate physics departments require a reading knowledge of one foreign language, Physics majors planning graduate work should, if possible, study some Russian, Ger\u00ad man, or French. Introductory courses in biology and chemistry are also recommended options. Every Physics major should avoid overspecialization and wisely use undergraduate years to explore some areas remote from physics. Physics majors with interests other than graduate work in phys\u00ad ics or astronomy need not take as many physics courses as indi\u00ad cated above. Note also that alternatives to Physic.s major require\u00ad ments can be approved upon petition to the Department and the Office of the Associate Dean. As a guide to preparing a suit\u00ad able program, the Department makes the following suggestions: Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate school in engineering should complete the Applied Physics requirements. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in chemistry, biology, or various interdisciplinary areas should contain: Chemistry lA-B-C and SlA-B-C, and Biological Sciences 101, 103, and 104. The concentration in Biomedical Physics is offered for Physics majors who wish to follow an integrated program which com\u00ad bines biology and/ or chemistry with physics, and is suitable preparation for a graduate career in one of these interdiscipli\u00ad nary areas. The course program of Physics majors considering a teaching career in the public schools or the community colleges should contain: Education 171 and 170, or 172; and additional preparation in some other area of science or mathematics. Courses from the Physics 10-24 sequence may be appropriate. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in the history of science shoUld contain at least: History 29A-B-C. Courses from the Physics 10-24 sequence may be appropriate. Sample Program -Applied Physics The Applied Physics concentration within the Physics under\u00ad graduate degree program is designed to provide appropriate education to students who anticipate a career in industrial or technological research. It combines the fundamental knowledge of physical processes obtained from physics courses with the technical knowledge obtained from engineering courses, particu\u00ad larly electrical engineering courses. In addition to the basic courses in physics, a student is required to complete six courses in the School of Engineering approved by the Physics Depart\u00ad ment. Examples of appropriate courses include Engineering BOB, 101C,EE110A,EE110B,EE114A,EE114B,EE176,and EE178. Upon completion of the Applied Physics concentration, the student will receive a B.S. degree in Physics. A typical course program for Physics majors in the Applied Physics concentration differs from the Physics major program only in the junior and senior years. FALL WINTER Junior Physics 110A Physics 111A Engr. BOB Elective Physics 110A 113C 133 Engr. EEl lOB Elective Elective Engr. EE178 Program Planning -Biomedical Physics The Biomedical Physics concentration is designed for the stu\u00ad dent who anticipates a career in physics applied to biology and medicine, such as health physics or radiological physics, or who intends to work in a scholarly field which deals with the physi\u00ad cal aspects of biology or medicine, such as molecular biology or physiology. Completion of requirements for the Physics major is required, except as noted in the Biomedical Physics require\u00ad ments, as are six quarters of basic courses in biology and ch~mistry. (See table on p. 161.) A sequence of three or four integrated additional courses which must be approved by the program coordinator completes the program. Students who wish to follow the Biomedical Physics concentration are advised to seek guidance early in their college careers. The requirements are such that coordination of a \u00b7pro\u00ad gram in the first and second years is essential. Graduate Program The Department offers the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees in Phys\u00ad ics, the first in recognition of demonstrated knowledge of the basic facts and theories of physics, the second primarily in recognition of demonstrated capacity for independent research. In general, graduate study in physics is expected to be a full\u00ad time activity. Other proposed arrangements should be approved by the Graduate Committee. Complementing the formal courses, the Department offers regu\u00ad lar colloquia and informal seminars. The graduate student is a member of an intellectual community and is expected to partic\u00ad ipate fully in departmental activities. Attendance at colloquia is considered an essential part of graduate study. In addition, there are regular weekly research seminars in\u00b7condensed matter, high energy, and plasma physics. About 60 graduate students of physics were enrolled in 1980-81. Active programs of research are underway in high energy physics, condensed matter physics, low temperature physics, plasma physics, mathematical physics, and astrophysics. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Sources of support available to graduate students include teach\u00ad ing assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Students planning to pursue graduate work in physics should obtain a copy of the booklet Physical Sciences from the Department. Master of Science in Physics The requirements for the M.S. degree are: ( 1) at least three quarters of residence; and (2) mastery of graduate course mate\u00ad rial, which may be demonstrated either (a) by passing, with an average grade of B or better, a minimum of nine quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 213A-B, 214A, and 215A-B, and a written comprehensive examination; or (b) by passing the Ph.D. qualifying examination. Under spe\u00ad cial circumstances, a research project and thesis may be accepted in lieu of proficiency in some of the graduate course material. There is no foreign language requirement for the M.S. degree. In addition to the stated course requirements, all stu\u00ad dents who have not passed the Ph.D. qualifying examination must register continuously for Physics 264A-B-C (Seminar in Conceptual Physics). A typical program in preparation for the written examination for the M.S. degree would consist of 12 courses: 211 (Classical Mechanics) 212A-B (Mathematical Physics) 213A-B (Electtomagnetic Theory) 214A\u00b7B (Statistical Physics) 215A\u00b7B from Physics 212C, 214C, 215C, 216-219, or undergraduate upper-division courses in related areas. Doctor of Philosophy in Physics The principal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are a minimum of six quarters of residence, passage of a written and a two-part oral examination, and successful completion and defense of a dissertation reporting results of original research. In addition, PHYSICS 161 the Ph.D. candidate must complete certain graduate course requirements. There is no foreign language requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Course Requirements. The student is required to exhibit mastery of the basic sequences, Mathematical Physics, Classical Mechanics and Electtomagnetic Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mecha~;~ics. A minimum of 15 quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 212A-B, 213A-B, 214A-B, and 215A-B, must be passed with an average grade of B or better. In addi\u00ad tion, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualifying examination are required to register for Physics 264A-B-C. It is expected that students, having selected a research specialty, will ordinarily take the core course in that subject (237A-B-C, 238A-B-C, or 239A-B-C) early in their graduate career. Qpalifving Examination. For advancement to Ph.D. candi\u00ad dacy, a student must pass a qualifying examination consisting of a written part and two oral parts. The written part covers a broad range of fundamentals of physics at the advanced under\u00ad graduate and graduate levels. The first part of the oral examina\u00ad tion will be administered shortly after the written examination. All members of the first oral committee will be faculty from the Physics Departtnent. The second part of the oral examination will be taken approximately one year after successful comple\u00ad tion of the written examination and the first oral. The candidacy committee that administers the second oral examination will contain one or two faculty members from outside the Physics Departtnent. The second oral will cover principally material related to the broad and general features of the student's disser\u00ad tation area. The written portion of the qualifying examination will be given once per year, generally in the fall. The examina\u00ad tion may be taken by some students after one year of graduate study. A second attempt will be permitted if the first is not suc\u00ad cessful. A third attempt will be permitted only in extraordinary circumstances. Teaching Program. Experience in teaching is an integral part of the gradute program, and all graduate students are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate careers. A typical course program for Physics majors in the Biomedical Physics concenttation differs from the Physics major program in the sophomore, junior, and senior years.

A dissertation summarizing the results of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a doctoral committee appointed by the Graduate Council will be required for the Ph.D. degree. The criterion for the acceptability of a dissertation by the Department is that it be suitable for publication in a scientific journal. The dis~ertation must not have been submitted to any other institution prior to its sub\u00ad mission to the Physics Department at UCI. Defense of Dissertation. Upon completion of the disserta\u00ad tion, the student will take an oral examination, open to the pub\u00ad lic, before the doctoral committee. Suggested Course Sequence. Typical programs for the first two years designed to prepare the student for Ph.D. qualifica\u00ad tion and provide the foundation necessary for understanding and participating in modem research might include: First Year: Mechanics).

White, Ph.D. Michigan State University, Professor of Compar- ative Culture and Psychology John I. Yellott, Jr., Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Psychology Undergraduate and graduate education in the School of Social Sciences at UCI represents a commitment to modern social science. The classic subject matter areas of anthropology, eco\u00ad nomics, geography, linguistics, political science, psychology, and sociology are included in the School's educational programs, but these programs go well beyond the traditional disciplines and can be characterized by the following three-way emphasis: First, the faculty recognizes the value of systematic empirical observation and quantitative analysis in the study of human behavior. Developments in computer science and in mathemat\u00ad ics oriented toward the problems of the social sciences and the refinement of techniques for the observational, experimental, and statistical study of human behavior have contributed major new elements to social science. Students in the School of Social Sciences will become familiar with the mathematical, computa\u00ad tional, and statistical tools underlying modern social science. Second, many of the most interesting questions in the study of human behavior cannot be fixed within the traditional discipli\u00ad nary boundaries. Some of the new and evolving areas which cross orthodox boundaries are political sociology, public policy, cognitive anthropology, comparative culture, and psycholinguis\u00ad tics. Therefore, many courses and course modules are built around social science phenomena, rather than representing social science disciplines. Third, the School shares the academic philosophy that consid\u00ad ers the design of hypotheses and of systems of interrelated ideas about the possible structure of the world to be an essential part of scientific pursuit. Consequently, the educational programs place substantial emphasis on understanding social science phenomena through the development of theories that can be used to guide empirical studies. Opportunities for students in the School of Social Sciences to participate in the educational process extend well beyond attendance at courses. Students may develop independent study proposals in cooperation with interested faculty members; they are invited to participate in the quarterly evaluation of courses and instructors, to propose new courses and other modifica\u00ad tions in existing programs, to nominate candidates for visiting faculty appointments, and to serve on School committees. The School provides a variety of opportunities for faculty-student interaction, and students will find the faculty, administration, and academic counseling staff of the School highly accessible and responsive. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Special Facilities The School of Social Sciences maintains several special facilities for research and education. The Social Sciences Research Laboratory occupies the entire fourth floor of the Social Sci\u00ad ences Laboratory Building. The facility contains 40 experiment and control rooms situated around a central core where two PDP 11-44 computers are available for experimental research. The laboratory is used for faculty and student research. The Farm School, a small, open, and ungraded elementary school located in a rural setting adjacent to the campus, serves as a research facility for faculty and students having interests in children and how they learn. Each quarter undergraduates receive course credit for assisting staff teachers, for developing educational materials, and for observing and analyzing child behavior at the school. The Anthropology Laboratory provides research facilities which include computer terminals for statistical studies and for the analysis of texts and other verbal material. The laboratory is also available for undergraduate and graduate instruction in field methodology and analytical techniques through the use of video-Cassettes, films, tapes, computer quizzes, and artificial intelligence programs that simulate interviewing situations. The School also maintains a Video Laboratory where social sci\u00ad ence students and faculty can produce and edit video-tapes for various purposes. The facility currently contains a tape library used extensively in the study of conversation and interaction. Degrees Anthropology ......................................

Alternative 2 A student who has not completed the economics requirements specified above may obtain a B.A. degree in Economics by meeting the School requirements and following a program of study in the area, planned in consultation with a faculty advisor. The program is certified through a petition signed by the Dean and two regular members of the economics faculty. Students who wish to pursue this alternative are strongly advised to con\u00ad sult a faculty advisor well in advance of submitting a petition. Geography A B.A. degree in Geography may be obtained by meeting the School requirements and following a program of study in the area, planned in consultation with a faculty advisor. The pro\u00ad gram is certified through a petition signed by the Dean and two regular members of the Geography faculty. Students who wish to pursue this major are strongly advised to consult a faculty advisor well in advance of submitting a petition. LiQguistics Theoretical and Formal Linguistics School requirements must be met and must include 14 courses (56 units) as specified below: A. One introductory course in linguistics, either Linguistics 50 or Social Sciences 3. B. Social Sciences 50A. C.

Six upper-division elective courses in linguistics Computer Sci\u00ad ence 162. General Linguistics May be taken as a Social Sciences or as a Humanities major. If taken as a Social Sciences major, School requirements must be met and must include 14 courses (56 units) as specified below: A. One introductory course in linguistics, either Linguistiq 50 or Social Sciences 3. B. Two upper-division courses in each of the following modules: A-Linguistics 110-119 B-Social Sciences 141 series (same as Linguistics 120-129) C-Linguistics 130-139 D-Social Sciences 142 series (same as Linguistics 140-149) E-Linguistics 150-159 C. One year (three courses) in a single foreign language. Stu\u00ad dents are strongly urged to study a non-Indo-European language (such as Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Swahili) whenever available. In addition, students may elect a third linguistics track in Applied Linguistics. For information on the requirements for this track as well as those for General Linguistics when taken through the School of Humanities, see page 127. Political Science School requirements must be met and must include 11 courses ( 44 units) as specified below: A. Three introductory courses (12 units) in political science, Social Sciences 6A-B-C. B. Two lower-division courses in political science (eight units). C. Six upper-division courses in political science (24 units). Three of these courses must form a module. Honors Program in Political Science: The honors program in Political Science, open to selected students, provides for advanced work in either of two areas: Theory and Research, or Internship and Research. Admission to the program is based on a formal application normally submitted during the fall quarter of the student's junior year. In order for an application to be considered, two conditions must be met. The student must have UC IRVINE - 1981-1982an overall grade point average of at least 3.2, and the student must have completed at least five political science courses (with a grade point average of 3.5 or higher) by the end of fall quarter of the junior year. Successful completion of the honors pro\u00ad gram requires attendance at the Honors Seminar, completion of an honors thesis, and the passing of an oral examination admin\u00ad istered by three faculty members of the political science faculty. Psychology School requirements must be met and must include 15 courses ( 60 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 7. B. Two four-unit lower-division psychology courses selected from courses listed in the following three groups. The student is strongly encouraged to take courses from two different groups. Group A: Social Sciences SOK; 51A. C. Social Sciences 2A or 2B, and 8, or approved substitutes (eight units). D. Ten four-unit upper-division courses with emphasis in psy\u00ad chology, distributed as follows: (1) Three courses (four or more units each) taken from one of the following modules: Social Sciences 141; 14 any module or combina\u00ad tion of modules other than the module selected to satisfy ( 1) above. (3) Four additional four-unit upper-division psychology courses. These may be selected from any of the modules listed above, including the module used to satisfy ( 1 ), as well as from special topics courses which are psychology-related. Students are also encouraged to take psychology courses outside the School of Social Sciences if such courses are appropriate to their educational goals. Social Science Requirements for the B.A. degree in Social Science are met by completing the School requirements on page 167. Sociology School requirements must be met and must include 11 courses ( 44 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 8. B. Social Sciences 61E. C. Two lower-division courses (eight units) that emphasize sociology. It is strongly recommended that students take one course on sociological methods (such as Social Sciences 61C or 1A) and one course on a special area of sociology (such as Social Sciences 61 B). D. Three upper-division courses (12 units) that emphasize sociology. SOCIAL SCIENCES 169 E. Four: courses ( 16 units) in social science disciplines outside sociology, or in history or social ecology. Three of these courses must be in the same field, e.g., three courses in economics or three in history. These courses may be upper-or lower-division. They may not be counted as part of the breadth requirement. Double Majors In order to double major within the School of Social Sciences, the following conditions must be met: (1) Normally, neither major program may be the gen~ral social science program. (2) Major and School requirements must be met for both majors with no overlap of courses except for those used to satisfy the mathematics, computer science, and introductory social science requirements. The mathematics and computer sci\u00ad ence courses need only be taken once. Only two introductory social science classes are needed, provided this also meets the requirements of both major programs. The same two-digit and upper-division courses may not be used to meet the require\u00ad ments of more than one major program. For example, a student who would like to major in psychology and anthropology may take one of the mathematics sequences, Information and Com\u00ad puter Science 1, and may use Introduction to Psychology and Introduction to Anthropology to meet the major and School requirements f-:,r both programs. However, two different sets of two-digit and upper-division courses must be taken to complete the major and School requirements of the two programs. Honors Concentration in Social Thought The School of Humanities and the School of Social Sciences offer an honors concentration in Social Thought. The concen\u00ad tration offers undergraduates the opportunity to examine major social theories and their implications in a systematic and thor\u00ad ough way. For a complete description of the concentration, see page 131. Concentration in Women's Studies The Women's Studies concentration is not a major but is intended to allow a student to complement any major in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology by the systematic study of women in culture and society. For further information on the concentra\u00ad tion, see page 132.- Planning a Program of Study Since there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major require\u00ad ments, students should consult with their assigned faculty advi\u00ad sors or visit the Undergraduate Advising Office ( 62 7 Social Sci\u00ad ence Tower) to design an appropriate program of study. Students who elect one of the Social Sciences majors in their freshman year might begin by taking the one-digit courses required by their major and one of the mathematics sequences listed under Part A of the School requirements. It is a good idea to take these courses early since they include fundamental con\u00ad cepts that will be widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division Writing Requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) should be completed during UC IRVINE - 1981-1982170 SOCIAL SCIENCES the first year. In the sophomore year, the student might com\u00ad plete the course on computing, three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in the social sciences, and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advan\u00ad tage by taking courses in theory, research methods, mathemat\u00ad ics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. Transfer Students Freshmen and Sophomores: Students transferring to UCI as freshmen or sophomores will fulfill the regular requirements of the four-year program either through work at UCI or through transfer credit for comparable work elsewhere. Juniors: Junior transfers electing to major in one of the School's degree programs and with good records at other ac\u00ad credited colleges and universities normally will be presumed to have satisfied School requirement B and the University require\u00ad ments, with the exception of the upper-division Writing Re\u00ad quirement of the breadth requirement (Category I). Students anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year, however, should plan their programs so as to anticipate the special mathematics requirements of the program (School requirement A). Every effort will be made to accommodate individual varia\u00ad tion in background, provided students are prepared to commit themselves to intensive work in areas of deficiency. Ordinarily, the typical two-year program for junior transfers is simply the last two years of the regular four-year program, except that stu\u00ad dents who have not satisfied the mathematics requirements of the School should plan to do so in the junior year and must do so before graduation. Seniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the School by transferring to UCI in their senior year should plan their work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make senior transfers difficult. The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Students who are interested in a career in administration and who have completed all of the course requirements for the B.A. degree in one of the major programs in the School of Social Sciences may apply to the Graduate School of Management for their 3-2 Program. Application should be made early in the jun\u00ad ior year. During the senior year, students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 total units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon successful comple\u00ad tion of the required courses and units, usually at the conclusion of four years of undergraduate study, a B.A. degree will be awarded in the student's major by the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences. A Master's degree in Administration will be awarded after successful completion of all requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. Teaching Credentials Students planning to seek State of California teaching creden\u00ad tials in social science should discuss their undergraduate curric\u00ad ulum plans with the School's academic counselors. Students completing any of the B.A. programs in the School qualify for a waiver of the Single Subject Credential Examination in social science. For additional information about teaching credentials, see the Teacher Education section. Mathematics and Social Science The mathematics requirement stems from the nature of modern social science. The concepts and terms of mathematics, statis\u00ad tics, and computers are an important part of the social scien\u00ad tist's vocabulary. Basic knowledge of these tools is necessary to an understanding of current literature in these fields, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of models in social sciences. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have a basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and computing. In addition, for students who are pre\u00ad paring for graduate school in an area of social science, it will be important to supplement the minimal mathematics require\u00ad ments with additional courses related to mathematics and social science methodology. The particular courses which would be recommended are not specified here, however, since they are highly dependent on the major emphasis of the student. Stu\u00ad dents who are preparing for graduate study should consult their advisors to determine a program of study which will give them the research skills necessary for successful graduate work. Graduate Programs Graduate education within the School of Social Sciences is focused upon Cognitive Sciences; Comparative Culture; Poli\u00ad tics, Society, and Social Issues; and Social Relations (including anthropology). Four interdisciplinary groups of faculty are responsible for graduate study in these areas of emphasis. A fifth faculty group with shared interests in economic theory, public economics, and the evaluation of public policy is devel\u00ad oping an emphasis in Economics and Public Policy. A sixth faculty group is developing an emphasis in Networks. Most entering Ph.D. students will be admitted to one of the groups and assigned a faculty advisor by that group. Indepen\u00ad dent doctoral study may be offered to a limited number of stu\u00ad dents interested in an interdisciplinary area of social science not encompassed by one of the groups. The work of these students will be guided by a faculty committee of at least three members that is appointed by the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. Doctoral study in Comparative Culture leads to the Ph.D. in Comparative Culture. Doctoral study in one of the other groups or under the interdisciplinary committee system leads to the Ph.D. in Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science, depending upon the focus of the student's dissertation. All can\u00ad didates for the Ph.D. must satisfy the general requirements of the School of Social Sciences and of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. The graduate program of the School does not include educational, counseling, or clinical psychology. The School does not offer a program leading to a Master of Arts degree, although the M.A. degree in Comparative Culture or Social Science may be conferred upon doctoral students who UC IRVINE - 1981-1982satisfy the requirements of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. Applications for admission to the M.A. T. program in Comparative Culture are not being accepted at this time. Admissions Potential graduate students should apply to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research for admission to the graduate program of the School of Social Sciences, indicating the title of the degree which they intend to pursue (Ph.D. in Comparative Culture, Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science), and the academic area in which they expect to concentrate. In addi\u00ad tion to the Division admission requirements, each group may prescribe special requirements or expectations of applicants. All applicants are required to submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test. Letters of recommendation are an important factor in the admission decision. The Program in Comparative Culture admits new graduate students only for the fall quarter of even-numbered years. Financial Aid Limited financial support in the form of teaching assistantships and fellowships is available to qualified students. There may be research assistantships available under grants to individual faculty. Students are expected to seek aid for which they are eligible from sources external to the University. General Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree in Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science The general requirements for the Ph.D. in Political Science, Psy\u00ad chology, or Social Science (in addition to those which apply to all UCI graduate students) are summarized below. Each recog\u00ad nized group within the School of Social Sciences may describe additional requirements, subject to the approval of the Gradu\u00ad ate Council. Length of Study The faculty envisions a student's Ph.D. program to be of approx\u00ad imately four to five years duration. Residence Because the intellectual training the School proposes requires full-time study and constant contact with the faculty, the School does not accept part-time students. Language A knowledge of one foreign language, appropriate to the stu\u00ad dent's research concerns, is required. Each student's group or candidacy committee will prescribe specific requirements. For those proposing to engage in field research, this may involve interviewing capabilities. Quantitative Methods Candidates for the Ph.D. degrees in Social Science, Political Science, or Psychology must satisfy a quantitative methods requirement. This may be met by ( 1) satisfaction of the quanti\u00ad tative methods requirement of the student's group, or (2) com\u00ad pletion of two years of college-level mathematics, statistics, logic, or applications of statistics to social science research prob-SOCIAL SCIENCES 171 !ems, in courses approved by the student's group or committee. In the latter option, courses may include one computer science course; ordinarily at least one year of these quantitative methods courses will be taken during the student's graduate career. Examinations The scope and format of the qualifying examinations will be determined by the student's candidacy committee. These exam\u00ad inations may be written or oral, or both, and usually will be conducted after approximately two years of residence. Also, a student may be required to take additional examinations, sub-. mit research papers, or conduct experiments which the commit\u00ad tee deems appropriate to the student's interests and goals. Upon satisfactory completion of the qualifying examinations, and approval of the dissertation topic, the candidacy committee will recommend that the student be advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Dissertation Following advancement to candidacy, the dissertation is super\u00ad vised by a doctoral committee ordinarily consisting of three members of the candidacy committee. The purpose of the dis\u00ad sertation is to demonstrate the student's ability to originate in\u00ad teresting and significant research problems, to investigate such problems both broadly and deeply, and to write scholarly mate\u00ad rial of publishable quality.

Wexler: Theoretical Psycholiriguistics John I. Yellott, Jr.: Mathematical Models and Visual Perception The Cognitive Sciences group is made up of certain faculty of the School of Social Sciences and graduate students who are pursuing the Ph.D. in either Psychology or Social Science, all of whom share common research interests in human cognition. The Cognitive Sciences group is concerned with how the human mind works. It conducts research and provides advanced graduate training in cognitive psychology and theoret\u00ad ical linguistics. The group lays special stress on precise, scien\u00ad tific approaches to issues in human cognition. It views the for\u00ad mation of formal models as instrumental in understanding what the human mind is all about. The group takes as its intellectual domain the following: mathematical psychology, perception (visual and auditory), cognitive development, problem solving, learning, memory, psycholinguistics, iconics, and theoretical linguistics. It does not UC IRVINE - 1981-198217Z SOCIAL SCENCES emphasize traditional training in psychology or linguistics per se; rather, it stresses the integration of research in the areas mentioned above (and related areas) into a discipline whose central focus is the study of human knowledge and human information processing, regardless of the medium in which it is expressed. Admissions In addition to meeting the general requirements for admission, applicants should have acquired a background in mathematics equivalent to at least one year of calculus. Advanced courses in some of the following fields are considered highly desirable: computer science, mathematics and the physical sciences, biol\u00ad ogy, logic, and linguistics. Each admission application will be considered on its own merits. Requirements Each student is expected to take two three-course graduate sequences. The first is a three-quarter methods sequence cover\u00ad ing the areas of probability and statistics, experimental design, and mathematical models of language. The other is a pro\u00ad seminar sequence covering areas such as learning, memory, per\u00ad ception, and linguistics. Suitable substitutes may be made with written approval of the group. Additional advanced course work in other fields relevant to the student's interests will sup\u00ad plement the required courses. Each student is expected to carry out theoretical/empirical research during the first two years. By the end of the second year, each student should complete a research project of a scope and nature that potentially could be published in a relevant journal. The student's advisor is responsible for assisting in the planning and other facets of the project. Students are expected to write a paper based on their research and to present a talk to the \"Cognitive Sciences Seminar\" or another appropriate forum by the end of the spring quarter of their second full year in the graduate program. Reviews At the end of each academic year, the faculty in the group will meet to discuss the progress of each of its students and to provide feedback on the progress and perceived deficiencies for each student. The advancement-to-candidacy examination will consist of an oral examination and possibly a written examination as well. Normally this step will be completed by the end of the third or beginning of the fourth year of the program. The examination will be based on the student's dissertation proposal. If the stu\u00ad dent should fail the examination the first time, there will be, at most, one additional opportunity to take the examination. A student who fails the examination twice will be asked to with\u00ad draw. Prior to submission of the final version of the dissertation the student will be expected to defend the dissertation in a public colloquium. Comparative Culture .

White: Black Psychology, Community Mental Health, Child Development, and Psychotherapy The doctoral program in Comparative Culture emphasizes study centering on the cultures of the United States, including domi\u00ad nant and minority cultures and their antecedents. The program is designed to educate interdisciplinary intellectuals, teachers, and research scholars. The range of cultures found in America is studied on a comparative basis, with some smdents concen\u00ad trating upon the expressive forms of culture (literature, religion, myth, and the arts} and others on culture from the perspective of social inquiry (history and the social sciences). However, all students will gain interdisciplinary training as comparative ana\u00ad lysts in both broad areas. Finally, the program is intended to prepare graduate students for academic positions in interdisci\u00ad plinary programs as well as in departments of humanities and social sciences. Admission Requirements and standards for admission into the program are in keeping with those of the University of California as a whole. Students with a B.A. degree will be considered for admission on the basis of past academic performance and present academic interests. In addition to the general application material, Gradu\u00ad ate Record Examination Aptitude Test scores are required. Applicants who are admitted to the program begin their study in the fall quarter of the academic year. The deadline for appli\u00ad cations is February 1. The program admits new graduate stu\u00ad dents only for the fall quarter of even-numbered years. Residence Although the University residence requirement for the Ph.D. is a minimum of six quarters, doctoral students in Comparative Culture must complete three years of course work (108 units). Normally, three courses (12 units} will be completed per quarter. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Required and Elective Courses The program requires 21 courses (84 units for the doctorate). Courses are selected in consultation with the academic advisor, to prepare the student for the comprehensive first-year exami\u00ad nation, the qualifying examination, and the development of a dissertation topic. The Proseminar in Expressive Forms (Social Science 27oA-B) and the Proseminar in Social Inquiry (Social Science 273A-B) are required of all first-year graduate students. In addition each stu\u00ad dent must enroll in five approved electives. Electives may be taken in Comparative Culture or other areas pertinent to the program. During the second year, a course sequence in Nondominant American Classes and Cultures (Social Science 274A-B) is required of all doctoral students. For students emphasizing Social Inquiry, Cross-Cultural Comparisons, a methodological sequence (Social Science 275A-B-C) is also required while Expressive Forms students must complete a methodologies sequence (Social Science 276A-B-C) or approved alternative courses. Each second-year student must enroll in four approved electives totaling 16 additional units. During the third year, all doctoral students must enroll in three approved electives (12 units). All graduate students, including Teaching Assistants and Asso\u00ad ciates, are expected to enroll for a minimum of 12 units of aca\u00ad demic credit (ordinarily, three courses) each quarter. Any stu\u00ad dent who wishes to take more than four courses (16 units) must petition the Graduate Committee and gain approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Incomplete grades will not be assigned for year-long courses except in extenuating circumstances. Credit for Previous Academic Work Students entering with an M.A. degree may request credit for a maximum of nine courses (36 units). These courses might be accepted in lieu of electives. A written petition requesting an acceptance of previous work in lieu of electives should be made to the Graduate Committee after consultation with the aca\u00ad demic advisor. Approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research is required. Language Requirements One foreign language and one \"alternate skill\" are required. The language will be decided upon by the student in consultation with the advisor. The language requirement must be satisfied either through a standard ETS examination or by another method approved by the Graduate Committee. The \"alternate skill\" may be another language, or a sequence of two courses in statistics, linguistics, or computer science, or some acceptable skill from the arts which is necessary for research. Both the lan\u00ad guage and the alternate skill must be satisfied before the qualify\u00ad ing examination can be taken. Comprehensive First-Year Examination Prior to the commencement of class work for the fall quarter, second-year doctoral students are administered a comprehensive examination which covers the materials from the two prosemi-SOCIAL SCIENCES 173 nars offered during the first year, including reading lists pro\u00ad vided in those seminars. An ad hoc examination committee appointed by the Chair reads the examinations. It is possible for students who fail this examination to take it a second time. A second failure results in academic disqualification and no degree will be awarded. A student who passes the first or second exam\u00ad \u00b7ination may be awarded the M.A. degree. On the basis of students' performance in courses and on the comprehensive examination, the program faculty will decide which students to invite to continue studies toward the Ph.D. degree. Master of Arts Degree Those doctoral students who pass the first-year comprehensive examination but do not continue beyond that point, or those who have passed the Ph.D. Qualifying Examination, may be awarded the Master of Arts degree by (a) completing 36 units (nine courses), 24 units (six courses) of which must be in Comparative Culture and 12 units (three courses) of which are approved electives in Comparative Culture or a related area; and (b) demonstrating proficiency in a second language or an alternate skill. The Ph.D. Qualifying Examination Doctoral students are administered two examinations, one writ\u00ad ten and one oral. The written examination is scheduled after the completion of course work and language requirements. The student's committee, formed by the Chair of the Graduate Committee in consultation with the student, is responsible for formulating the examination questions. The examination will be based on program courses and electives taken by the student during the second and third years. The entire program faculty can be called upon to submit questions for the examination, and the entire faculty will read the examinations. If the student passes the examination, the student will then be advanced to the oral examination. The oral examination follows successful com\u00ad pletion of the written examination by two weeks or less and is conducted by a candidacy committee (normally the student's advisory committee) appointed in the name of the Graduate Council. This committee normally consists of five members of the UCI Academic Senate or persons with equivalent qualifica\u00ad tions, and will include at least one member who does not hold a faculty appointment in Comparative Culture. The committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. if the candidate successfully completes the oral examination. Students who fail the written examination may, upon petition, take it a second time. Two failures result in academic disqualification. The Dissertation The final requirement for the Ph.D. degree is completion of a dissertation which is approved by the doctoral committee - appointed by the Graduate Council. Master of Arts in Teaching in Comparative Culture This graduate degree program is 'designed primarily for those who want to pursue a career in education at the elementary, secondary, or community college level. M.A. T. students may work concurrently toward a California Teaching Credential, or UC IRVINE - 1981-1982174 SOCIAL SCIENCES may be experienced teachers who wish to upgrade their profes\u00ad sional preparation. Based upon an interdisciplinary and com\u00ad parative framework embracing the range of cultures found in the United States, the M.A.T. prepares its graduates to teach and facilitate the development of multicultural studies in several subject areas. Specifically, our M.A.T. program focuses on the study of Comparative Culture with a special concentration in literature, history, and social sciences relating to various ethnic groups of America. These emphases will be framed by the stu\u00ad dents' interests and needs with respect to their career goals in the field of education. Since the M.A.T. and Ph.D. programs in Comparative Culture have different goals, the students in the M.A.T. program are not automatically advanced to doctoral training. Students who wish to pursue the doctoral degree in Comparative Culture must apply to the Graduate Committee of Comparative Culture. Admissions At the present time applications for the M.A.T. program are not being accepted. Residence The minimum residence requirement for the M.A.T. is three quarters. Required and Elective Courses In addition to the courses which may be required for the cre\u00ad dential, the M.A.T. program consists of at least nine courses (36 units), six of which must be at the graduate level. Outside of the required three-quarter sequence core course, Multicultural Foundations of Education, each student may establish an indi\u00ad vidualized program in consultation with the M.A.T. program advisor. The student will develop and carry out an appropriate project in the teaching of ethnic cultures and/or minority stu\u00ad dents, and submit a report of the project demonstrating an inte\u00ad gration of theoretical knowledge and applied skills for the \u00b7approval of the thesis committee. Language Requirement For those who are recommended to acquire proficiency in a second language or alternate skills pertinent to cultural educa\u00ad tion, additional courses may be required.

Members are committed to studies involving the application of social science theory to the solution of social issues. The Ph.D. is granted in either Political Science or Social Science. The group places special emphasis on recruiting students who propose to pursue research in the following areas: (a) authority, power, and value allocations-relating to public policy, to organization, to participation, and to relationships within and between social and political units; (b) change and structure of cultures and of social and political units; and (c) empirical the\u00ad ory, mathematical models, and quantitative analysis of political phenomena. Faculty are currently conducting research on authority relations, organizational theory, and bureaucratic behavior; economic models of political behavior; mass media and society; racy political political science; foreign policy and international relations; and comparative politics with an emphasis on Europe and Latin America. Two University research institutes affiliated with the group through joint faculty appointments-the Institute of Transpor\u00ad tation Studies and the Public Policy Research Organization-are located at the University of California, Irvine. Both sponsor theoretical and applied research on social issues. They also may .provide research funding for graduate students who select pub\u00ad lic policy or transportation as a specialized field. Admissions Students are normally expected to have a grade point average above 3.0 and scores on the two parts of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Aptitude Test which total over 1,100. Decisions on admission are strongly influenced by letters of recommendation a,nd the statement of student interest. Interna\u00ad tional students will be evaluated primarily on the basis of letters of recommendation and completed seminar or research papers, but GRE scores are required in all cases. Requirements The following is in addition to the general School and campus requirements. Each year a core program, focusing upon method\u00ad ology and substantive problems of current interest, will be out\u00ad lined for entering graduate students. Those who have not already taken college mathematics are required to take at least three quarters of approved mathematics or statistics courses. At the completion of the first year, the performance of each stu\u00ad dent is reviewed and the faculty will indicate whether the stu\u00ad dent should continue. Attendance in a colloquium series also is required for all graduate students during their first two years in residence. Reviews and Examinations At the completion of the first year, a review of performance in the core program will be conducted for each student by the Network faculty. Students ordinarily are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or better. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Comprehensive written examinations are required before a stu\u00ad dent can be advanced to candidacy. The level of competence required in mathematics and language will be decided by the student's candidacy committee. Students may take the comprehensive examination on two occasions. Students who have not been advanced to candidacy at the end of nine quarters of graduate study may be disquali\u00ad fied for unsatisfactory academic progress.

Watt: Iconics, Linguistics, Anthropology The faculty in Social Relations shares with traditional anthro\u00ad pology an interest in whole systems and a willingness to con\u00ad sider long-as well as short-run sociocultural effects. It has a commitment to include the meaning and content of the actions, events, and phenomena it studies from the micro-to the macro\u00ad level. The faculty also is concerned about similarities and differ\u00ad ences among people living at different times and in different places. Unlike traditional anthropology, however, we have not limited our interests to small communities nor to traditional forms of data collection or analysis. In addition, the program leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science with emphasis in anthro\u00ad pology is distinct from more traditional anthropology programs in that it includes no requirements in archaeology or physical anthropology. Admissions We welcome students from diverse educational and social back\u00ad grounds. Students who have research interests corresponding to those of specific faculty members are especially encouraged to apply to this apprenticeship-type program. They should famil\u00ad iarize themselves with the publications of the faculty before applying. Requirements Students are admitted by the entire Social Relations faculty. New students are assigned an advisor who serves until a three\u00ad person committee is formed, which occurs by the middle of the SOCIAL SCIENCES 175 second year of residence. The committee oversees the student's academic work and ordinarily is chaired by the faculty member with whom the student plans to work most closely. A core seminar which meets weekly throughout the year is required of first-year graduate students. Student:; are expected to attend the Social Relations Colloquium Series throughout their graduate careers. In addition, two quarters of statistics, mathematics, computer science, or other appropriate analytical methods are required. Normally these will be completed during the first two years of study. Reviews During the first year each student will prepare an original paper under the committee's direction. The paper will be presented by the student at a meeting of the Colloquium Series, normally during the spring quarter of the first year. The student's com\u00ad mittee members will provide the student with a detailed written critique of the paper as part of the first-year evaluation of the student's overall progress. The second review takes the form of an advancement-to\u00ad candidacy examination. This ordinarily is conducted by the stu\u00ad dent's committee and two additional faculty members from the campus. Students are expected to take this examination no later than the spring quarter of their third year. Satisfactory completion of the dissertation is the final require\u00ad ment in completing the Ph.D. Foreign Language A speaking or reading kn~wledge of one foreign language is required. Economics and Public Policy, and Networks Faculty with shared interests in ( 1) economic theory, public economics, and public policy, or with shared interests in (2) relations among social units with an emphasis on mathemat\u00ad ical and computer techniques in data analysis and modeling, are developing interdisciplinary emphases in these two areas within the School of Social Sciences. At present, there is no forriial graduate curriculum leading to the Ph.D. in the areas described below. Rather, individual programs under the interdisciplinary committee system may be approved for selected graduate stu\u00ad dents, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Sciences. Prior to applica\u00ad tion, prospective students whose interests include economics and public policy or networks are advised to consult with one of the faculty listed under the appropriate headings below. Economics and Public Policy Duran Bell: Formal Models, Labor Economics Frank Cancian: Economic Anthropology Gordon J. Fielding: Urban Theory and Transportation Policy Amihai Glazer: Industrial Organization and Policy Analysis Bernard Grofman: Public Choice, Law and Economics, and Models of Collective Decision Making John Johnston: Econometrics Sheen T. Kassouf: Econometrics and Economics of Uncertainty Charles A. Lave: Transportation Policy, Economics of Energy, and Social Change UC IRVINE - 1981-1982176 SOCIAL SCIENCES Julius Margolis: Economic Analysis of Government Behavior: Positive and Normative Christian Werner: Mathematical Geography and Transportation Networks Economists and faculty from the other social sciences who share interests in public economics, evaluation of public policy, and economic theory are developing an area of emphasis in Economics and Public Policy. This specialization was chosen for two reasons: first, governments and nonprofit institutions now occupy a primary role in our society so that an understanding of their behavior has become critical to understanding the economy in general; second, public economics has become one of the most intellectually exciting frontiers in economic analysis. Special emphasis is on research in the following areas: public choice, political economy, public policy, and organizational behavior. Graduate courses taught by the faculty listed above focus on positive and normative analysis of the behavior of government in formulating and implementing public policy. Theory building is emphasized, as well as empirical studies in governmental behavior and substantive areas of public policy. The School of Social Sciences has strengths in formal social analysis which are valuable adjuncts to economic theorizing about the public sector. Members of the group are affiliated with two major research institutes, the Institute of Transporta\u00ad tion Studies and the Public Policy Research Organization. Public policy and economics are central issues of both institutes. These research institutes provide funding for graduate students who select public policy or transportation as a specit: :zed field. The existing academic programs in medicine and social ecology also provide intellectual support. Networks William Batchelder: Mathematical Models, Measurement, and Cogni- tive Processes Duran Bell: Formal Models, Labor Economics John P. Boyd: Mathematical Anthropology Michael Burton: Cognitive Anthropology, Economic Anthropology, SoCial Organization, Cross-Cultural Comparisons Douglas Chalmers: Social Psychology Linton Freeman: Social Networks and Social Structure Tarow Indow: Mathematical Psychology and Perception Jerome Kirk: Sociology, Social Anthropology, Social Psychology, Social Control and Politics Craig MacAndrew: Psychology, Personaliry Theory Duane Metzger: Cognitive Anthropology, Belief Systems, and Semantic Analysis Louis Narens: Measurement and Logic A. Kimball Romney: Social Sciences, Social Anthropology, Cognitive Anthropology Rein Taagepera: Mathematical Models and Quantitative Analysis of Elections; Inequaliry, Arms Races, and Growth-Decline Phenomena Douglas R. White: Networks and Social Structure, Cross-Cultural Comparisons, Mathematical Anthropology, Division of Labor The faculty developing an area of emphasis in Networks focuses on relations among social units. These units may be individuals, organizations, or collectivities, but in every case, stress is placed on the patterns of relationships among them. The faculty shares an emphasis in mathematical and computer techniques in data analysis and modeling. Although no single mathematical tool can be said to dominate the field, its practi\u00ad tioners frequently use the theories of graphs, automata, semi\u00ad groups, and stochastic processes. Computers are used for multi\u00ad dimensional scaling and statistical analysis, as well as for simulations. The School of Social Sciences has always emphasized formal analysis, and it is out of this tradition that the faculty listed above draws strength. Many are affiliated with other programs, which underscores the interdisciplinary nature of the group. Several also belong to the Social Networks Focused Research Program, which supplies support to the group. At present, there is no formal set of courses leading to a doc\u00ad toral in Networks. Rather, individual programs of directed study with an emphasis in Networks are available for selected graduate students, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Sciences. Stu\u00ad dents applying for admissions to the Social Science Ph.D. pro\u00ad gram with an emphasis in Networks should first consult with a member of the Group. Courses in Social Sciences Courses in the School do not always resemble conventional university courses either in content or in format. Students at any level are encouraged to suggest areas of individual study and may (with faculty approval) pursue any intellectually challeng\u00ad ing area within the social sciences. Such courses may include special seminars, study projects, individual papers, or any other useful educational activity. The faculty encourages students to present evidence that they have done interesting and original work and to receive official credit for that work by enrolling in an individual study course. Such courses are numbered 198 and 199 (undergraduate) and 299 (graduate). Students from other schools are encouraged to take courses and talk with faculty within the School. In addition to the introduc\u00ad tory courses, many of the upper-division courses are open to students without previous work in social science. Since many of the courses touch on several areas of social science, a list of major areas of concentration is normally included in the de\u00ad scription of a course. The classification terms used for this pur\u00ad pose are anthropology, comparative culture, economics, geog\u00ad raphy, political science, psychology, and sociology. Most upper\u00ad division courses are arranged in modules in order to provide continuity over individual courses, to facilitate long-range plan\u00ad ning by students, and.to encourage the pursuit of interdiscipli\u00ad nary programs of study. Students are encouraged to take advan\u00ad tage of the module concept to acquire experience in several integrated sets of courses. It is not necessary, however, for students to take all courses listed in a module; module courses may be taken individually, as long as course prerequisites have been met. The specific courses offered in module form may vary from year to year, but the structure of the curriculum will remain stable. Ordinarily, a student can expect to find at least one module offered in each broad area each year. By observing the content area of courses and by making effective use of module sequences, a student can assemble an individual program of study in a particular discipline or in an interdisciplinary area. . Listed below are course descriptions of some of the proposed courses to be offered during 1981-82. A final, complete listing UC IRVINE - 1981-1982of the courses offered will be available prior to the beginning of each quarter in 627 Social Science Tower. Students who are interested in obtaining this material may receive copies by visit\u00ad ing or writing to the School of Social Sciences. NOTE: Students who entered UCI before fall quarter, 1980 should refer to the 1979-Bo UCI General Catalogue and previous editions for information on the course numbering and lettering system prior to fallz9Bo.

Standish, Associate Professor of Information and Computer Science (programming environments; data structures) The development of the modern digital computer has made possible the solution of large-scale information processing prob\u00ad lems in science, industry, and government. These problems include predicting the orbit of a satellite, simulating the econ\u00ad omy, keeping track of inventories, and sending mail electroni\u00ad cally. Such problems are solved by having the computer execute a procedure-a sequence of information processing operations including, but not limited to, arithmetic operations, testing and comparing numbers and representations of alphabetic informa\u00ad tion, and changing the sequence of operations within the com\u00ad puter. Information and computer science is concerned with the development of procedures which are effective and efficient, languages suitable for stating these procedures, systems for exe\u00ad cuting procedures, and the social setting in which they are used. The implications of research in the development of information processing procedures and of systems for preparing and execut\u00ad ing these procedures extend beyond the direct applications in using the modern digital computer to solve problems ranging from bookkeeping to the control of orbiting satellites. Many animate and inanimate systems can be usefully viewed as infor\u00ad mation processing systems and analyzed in terms of the way they represent, store, and process information. Thus informa\u00ad tion and computer science provides a point of view, an approach, for studying phenomena in many sciences. Computing resources available to students include interactive access to the systems in the campus Computing Facility: a DECsystem-10, a Xerox Sigrna-7, a DEC PDP-11145, and 12 Teraks. The departmental computing laboratory equipment includes a DECsystem-2020, several minicomputers, a com\u00ad plement of peripheral devices, and several microcomputer-based systems. On the basis of our experience over the past several years, we anticipate that the number of incoming freshmen and advanced\u00ad standing students who elect ICS as a major in the fall of 1982 will exceed the number of positions available. In the fall of 1981 about half of the incoming applicants who elected ICS were admitted to the major. To ensure that their application is considered for the fall of 1982, students should be sure to file their application so it arrives on campus before November 30, 1981. The selection criteria will include grades, test scores, and affirmative action considerations. Students interested in using computers as an adjunct to their major field of study will be able to enroll in the introductory programming sequence (ICS 1, 2, and 3). The Department is considering modifications to its rules for allowing students on campus to change majors to ICS, to its rules for admitting advanced-standing students, and to its undergraduate degree requirements. Please contact the Depart\u00ad ment for the current status of these rules. Degrees Information and Computer Science ......... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Honors at magna cum laude, summa cum laude, are awarded on the basis of grade point average and the student's performance on research. Approximately 12 per\u00ad cent of the graduating seniors are selected for honors. Undergraduate Program The undergraduate program in Information and Computer Sci\u00ad ence (ICS) is designed for students preparing for professional careers and for students preparing for graduate study in infor\u00ad mation and computer science. It is designed to acquaint the stu\u00ad dent with the currently available methods of information and computer science which are useful in solving problems of science, industry, and government; to prepare the student for the additional formal and self education required in this rapidly developing field; and to foster and extend the student's abilities to solve the kinds of problems encountered in information and computer science. The use of the computer as a problem\u00ad solving tool and the effects of its adoption on procedure and data repreSentation are the underlying themes of the program. Students enrolled in other degree programs who are interested in digital computer programming will normally begin their studies with Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving I (ICS 1) and continue in the programming sequence with Pro\u00ad gramming and Problem Solving II (ICS 2) and Programming and Problem Solving III (ICS 3) as far as their interests require and their programs permit. Students who are doing, or planning to do, extensive work with numerical problems are advised to consider courses in numerical analysis. Students interested in courses in computer engineering and dig\u00ad ital systems should consult the list of Engineering courses. Stu- UC IRVINE - 1981-1982dents can declare a double major in Engineering and\u00b7 ICS; early consultation on such a double major is advisable. Students are advised on academic matters by faculty and staff. Advising of undergraduate students is coordinated by the departtnental counselor who also provides information on voca, tional and counseling services available on the campus.

Software Design and Analysis-emphasis on the analysis, design, implementation, and management of software systems, such as operating systems, translators, and information retrieval systems. Information Systems-emphasis on the analysis of informa, tion requirements in organizations and the design of systems to meet those requirements. Computer System Organization-emphasis on the specifica, tion and synthesis of computer systems, particularly their organ, izational and hardware aspects. INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCE 193 Admission to the program requires a baccalaureate degree, including two years of course work beyond the introductory level in computer science and at least two years of college, level mathematics or equivalent work experience. The Graduate Record Examination (ORE) Aptitude Test is required, and the ORE Advanced Test in Computer Science is strongly recommended. The departmental Graduate Advisor for the M.S. program should be consulted upon entrance, and periodically thereafter, for guidance in the selection of appropriate courses. The Grad, uate Advisor also is an important source of information about other academic matters. When the student is prepared to begin work on the thesis and is advanced to candidacy for the M.S. degree, a formal thesis committee will be appointed to supervise the thesis and to accept it on behalf of the Graduate Council. The program consists of 12 courses (48 units). Three may be upper,division undergraduate courses. If appropriate to the program, up to three graduate courses (12 units) may be accepted as transfer credit from other institutions. Three courses ( 12 units) are required of all students in the M.S. program: ICS 221 (Analysis of Computer Systems) ICS 231 (Formal Analytic Techniques) ICS 245 (Introduction to Software Engineering) A thesis reporting on a major piece of technical work also is required. The program is available to students who are unable to study full time because of personal or professional commitments. Ph.D. Program The program leading to the Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science is research,oriented and encourages students to work together with faculty to solve advanced problems in computer science. Currently, active research groups are working in analy, sis of algorithms, artificial intelligence, machine architecture, programming environments, software engineering, and social impacts of computing. All of these studies have extra\"rnural funding. Students as well as faculty are active professionally; a number of student papers have recently been accepted for pub, lication in the proceedings of national conferences. The Ph.D. program is designed for full,tirne study, and can be completed in four to five v.ears, depending upon the focus of research. Admission Approximately 15 students are admitted each year. Applica, tions are evaluated on the basis of the student's prior academic record and potential for creative professional contributions. Applicants are expected to have good skills in computer pro, grarnrning and skills in mathematics equivalent to those obtained by students who complete college,level courses in logic and set theory, analysis, linear algebra, and modem algebra or probability and statistics. Computer science undergraduate training is not required, but some familiarity with machine organization, data structures, software systems, and formal models is helpfuL UC IRVINE - 1981-1982194INFORMATION AND COMPlTIER SCIENCE Applicants should take both the GRE Aptitude Test and the GRE Advanced Test in Computer Science. Where feasible, per\u00ad sonal interviews are desired, but inability to have one does not prejudice an application. Additional information on application procedures can be obtained from the Division of Graduate Stud\u00ad ies .and Research. Further information on the Department and the graduate program can be obtained by writing to the Department. Financial Assistance Financial assistance is available to students in the form of teach\u00ad ing and research assistantships. Stipends vary, depending on the duties involved, and range up to $7,000 for the academic year. Students who also teach or assist with faculty research during the summer may earn an additional $2,000 to $4,000 per year. More than half of the doctoral students in residence receive financial assistance. General Requirements for the Ph.D. The Ph.D. degree is attained in three phases. Phase L Breadth: The purpose of the breadth phase is to develop the student's understanding of broad areas in computer science. Understanding is certified by satisfactory performance on a written preliminary examination which examines knowledge in five areas: 1. Architecture and Operating Systems 2. Programming Languages and Data Structures 3. Formal Methods 4. Artificial Intelligence 5. Design, Analysis, and Impact of Systems The examination is designed to test both basic knowledge and problem-solving ability. It is given twice a year, once in October and once in May. Students are required to pass the examination by the end of their second year. Phase IL Directed Research: Research under faculty direction in this phase is intended to develop research skills such as use of the literature; problem identification, definition, and analysis in depth; and creative problem solving. This research may be con\u00ad ducted individually or with other students. Phase II concludes with an oral qualifying examination conducted by a formal can\u00ad didacy committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. In this examination the student must demon\u00ad sttate the essential research skills. Phase IlL Dissertation: This phase is devoted almost exclu\u00ad sively to the dissertation. When the student has passed the for\u00ad mal qualifying examination and advanced to candidacy, a doc\u00ad toral committee is appointed to supervise the dissertation and approve it on behalf of the Graduate Council. The timing and methods chosen by students and their faculty advisors to develop competence in different areas are expected to vary. Typically the student and the advisors will outline a program for each area that makes use of a combination of the following resources: courses, individual study, project work, directed research. Colloquium: Each student shall present a colloquium to the Department in the area of interest prior to entering the disserta\u00ad tion phase. Teaching Requirement: All ICS graduate students are re\u00ad quired to participate in teaching activities before being advanced to candidacy. Teaching activities in summer or night school, service at other universities, etc., may be accepted as fulfillment of the requirement. Programming Competence Requirement: A computer sci\u00ad entist must be able to read and write programs in assembly, algebraic, and nonnumericallanguages. Faculty Research Interests Research areas of the faculty include multimachine and dis\u00ad tributed machine architecture, data flow and reduction language machines, data flow representations of data base, programming languages, program development and maintenance environ\u00ad ments, data structures, analysis of algorithms and concrete com\u00ad plexity, natural language processing, knowledge representation, computer models of music theory, sofrware engineering tools and methods especially for analysis and design, social impacts of computing, and management of computing resources.

Harvard University, Professor of Social Ecology and Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs The Program in Social Ecology applies interdisciplinary scien\u00ad tific methods to the study of a wide range of recurring soeial and environmental problems. Among the issues of longstanding interest to the Program are violence in society, social influences on normal and atypical human development over the life span, and aspects of the physical environment which have an impact on human health and behavior. The curriculum is organized around three major problem areas (Environmental Analysis, Criminal Justice, Social Behavior) rather than by traditional academic disciplines (e.g., regional planning, criminology, psychology). The Program in Social Ecology maintains a central interest in human adaptation, and a special but not exclusive interest in the study of events in the natural settings in which they occur. Social ecologists also use laboratory, questionnaire, and interview methods to study human social and environmental problems. The faculty of Social Ecology is multidisciplinary. It includes psychologists who have specialized in developmental, environ\u00ad mental, community, and social psychology; sociologists; planners; environmental health scientists; and lawyers. While faculty members are firmly grounded in their parent disciplines and teach basic courses in them, they concentrate their efforts on teaching and research with a problem orientation. In these problem-oriented courses, they integrate concepts and perspec\u00ad tives of several disciplines. This focus arises from commitment to the view that the analysis of complex societal problems requires interdisciplinary efforts (i.e., the joining of talents by people with different intellectual backgrounds). Another feature of instruction in Social Ecology is the use of lecturers from the community, individuals whose academic qualifications are com\u00ad plemented by their experiences with practical applications. For example, a judge, an architect, and a former police officer are among those who teach courses in the Program. A number of social ecologists are involved in interventions directed toward UC IRVINE - 1981-1982198 SOCIAL ECOLOGY improving the way groups of individuals, institutions, and communities function; a number of others are involved in interventions aimed at improving the quality and control of the environment. Degrees Social Ecology ........................ B.A., M.A., Ph.D. Applied Ecology (offered jointly with the School of Biological Sciences) ............. B.A. Honors Honors at graduation will be awarded to about 12 percent of the graduating seniors. Initial eligibility for such honors will be on the basis of grade point average. Final decisions concerning the awards of summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude will reflect a number of other factors, including quarters of work completed at UCI, number of graded units of course work in Social Ecology, and the quality of papers written for field study and independent study. Decisions about the award of honors are the responsibility of a committee chaired by the Associate Director for Undergraduate Studies. Undergraduate Program in Social Ecology Social Ecology classes are oriented toward both theoretical and applied learning, so that each enhances and enlarges the other. The undergraduate program is organized around four curricular components: a Principles and Methods cluster and three sub\u00ad areas concerned broadly with problems of Environmental Anal\u00ad ysis, Criminal}ustice, and Social Behavior. Students do not major in a particular subarea; rather, they are expected to develop a degree of competence in each. Field Study. An important characteristic of the undergraduate program is its field study requirement for majors. Field study is open only to Social Ecology majors. In faculty-supervised field study situations, students relate theories learned in the class\u00ad room to actual social-environmental problems, use acquired skills to collect meaningful data, and test findings from con\u00ad trolled laboratory studies in the more complex settings in which significant behaviors and events actually occur. The settings provided for field study include a wide range of problem\u00ad oriented institutions and agencies, e.g., Orange County Planning Department, Orange County Department of Mental Health, Orange County District Attorney's Office, California Youth Authority, Environmental Education Council. Other field study placements may be generated by faculty and students to fit their particular interests. All field studies are taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis. Field studies may not be added after the second week of classes. Further information on field study, including information about sign-up procedures, may be obtained from the Social Ecology Counseling Office. Career Opportunities. Graduates of the Program in Social Ecology bring a distinctive cross-disciplinary perspective to the job market. The Program provides a solid foundation for those students who seek jobs in planning departments, mental health settings, and a variety of community and governmental agencies. Many Social Ecology students find that their interdisciplinary training is also useful for careers in management and personnel. The Program also provides sound preparation for students who wish to apply to graduate and professional schools of law, administration, public health, social welfare, psychology, sociol\u00ad ogy, criminology, and urban planning. Further information on career opportunities and graduate school preparation can be found in the Sample Programs section on page 199. Major Subareas Environmental Analysis The Environmental Analysis subarea is concerned with the impact of the physical environment on human health and behavior. Students begin with basic courses in human ecology, environmental quality, environmental psychology, and planning and public policy. Subsequent course work moves toward problem-oriented courses, enriched by ongoing faculty and stu\u00ad dent research. Such course work covers the effects of environ\u00ad mental stressors (e.g., crowding, smog, noise); the biology and politics of water pollution; the degree of compliance of different California counties with changes in environmental regulations designed to improve the quality of the environment; the way in which economic changes in a community affect the health and well-being of its residents; the psychological determinants of the decision to have children; and the effects of stress on health. In addition to providing basic knowledge for students in other areas, courses are relevant to professional careers in the areas of administration, environmental quality and health, environmen\u00ad tal impact assessment, and community environmental educa\u00ad tion. Graduate and professional opportunities related to envi\u00ad ronmental analysis include urban and regional planning, archi\u00ad tecture, environmental psychology, ecology; and public health. Special emphasis is placed upon the roles of individual citizens and community organizations, both governmental and private, in maintaining and enhancing the quality of the human envi\u00ad ronment. Field study is done at the Orange County. Planning Department, the offices of private architectural firms, environ\u00ad mental information centers, pollution control agencies, and health agencies. Criminal Justice The Criminal Justice subarea is concerned with the social con\u00ad trol of criminality and violence. The subarea focuses on factors that promote criminal behavior, and on the institutions, such as prisons and courts, that attempt to control criminality. Basic courses cover forms of criminal behavior and introduce the student to the criminal justice system. Subsequent course work is complemented by ongoing faculty and student research. Thus, stUdents learn about the prediction of individual violence; the determinants of police decisions to shoot; the relative effects of the law and of peer group norms on the use of illegal drugs; characteristics of persons and of situations which promote intervention by \"good Samaritans\" at the scene of crimes; vio\u00ad lence against women; and the control of delinquency through family counseling and crisis intervention. The Criminal Justice subarea provides Social Ecology students with opportunities to examine critical issues in regard to crimi\u00ad nal and delinquent behavior and society's reaction to crime. The course of study prepares students for careers in law enforcement and corrections, as well as for law school and UC IRVINE - 1981-1982other graduate programs, including criminology and sociology. Offerings examine social problems that involve crime, society's reactions to these problems, and assess the organization and operation of the criminal justice system as it now functions. Field study placements are available in police departments, prosecutor's and public .defender's offices, probation and parole agencies, consumer affairs agencies, and the state juvenile deten\u00ad tion system. Social Behavior The Social Behavior subarea is concerned with the relationship between the social environment and human behavior. The cen\u00ad tral objective is to study variations in social settings (e.g., the family, school, work place) that have implications for healthy and unhealthy development over the course of the life cycle. Students begin with basic course work in human life cycle development, social psychology, community psychology, and abnormal psychology. Subsequent course work, enriched by research, examines the effects of different types of day care facil\u00ad ities on young children's development; psychological conse\u00ad quences of psychostimulant medication in the treatment of childhood hyperactivity; social and economic factors associated with child abuse; the impact of early work experience on ado\u00ad lescents' economic power, psychological and social develop\u00ad ment, and career attitudes; and the role of social support (fam\u00ad ily and friendship networks) in moderating stressful life events. Approximately 50 agencies are available for field study in this subarea, including schools, child care facilities, community clin\u00ad ics, hospital settings, and social service agencies. A major objec\u00ad tive is to give students a foundation which will enable them to work in the private or public sectors or to do graduate work in psychology, and fields related to mental health, human devel\u00ad opment, and education after graduation from UCI. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. Social Ecology Requirements Social Ecology 1 (Principles of Social Ecology) and 10 (Re\u00ad search Design); any three of the following introductory Social Ecology courses: J4 (Introduction to Criminal Justice), ES (Introduction to Environmental Q.iality and Health), E6 (Popu\u00ad lations and Environments), E7 (Introduction to Planning and Public Policy), E8 (Introduction to Environmental Analysis), or S9 (Introduction to Human Behavior); required prerequisite courses for\u00b7field study in a given subarea; Social Ecology 197 A followed by two quarters offield study: E197, S197, or ]197, to be elected during the junior and senior years; and five upper\u00ad division courses (those numbered 100-196) from Program in Social Ecology offerings. Planning a Program of Study As noted earlier, students who major in Social Ecology do not limit themselves to a single subarea of interest. Rather, they are encouraged to develop an appreciation of a wide array of person-environment problems. The strongest program of study also will include basic course work in at least one of the social, biological, or physical sciences. Students who enter the major as freshmen should plan to complete the required lower-division SOCIAL ECOLOGY 199 courses by the end of the junior year. Transfer students and students who declare a major in Social Ecology after entering UCI should work with the Social Ecology Counseling Office to develop a plan for meeting the requirements of the major in an orderly fashion. The Social Ecology Counseling Office is prepared to help all students in planning a program of study. Contact with this Office is important so that students will develop a broad, yet coherent, series of courses. Students who expect to pursue graduate study should consult also with appropriate faculty members to ensure proper preparation. Sample Programs Many Social Ecology majors plan to attend graduate or profes\u00ad sional schools. Since the appropriate undergraduate preparation will vary depending upon the student's postgraduate plans, the Program makes the following suggestions. Psychology. Social Ecology offers a strong program of courses for students who are interested in careers or graduate education in psychology. Specifically, half the faculty have backgrounds in psychology and offer courses in developmental, environmental, community, social, and clinical psychology. Relevant Social Ecology courses for students pursuing career paths in these areas include the following: number of courses from the Schools of Social Sciences and Biological Sciences would strengthen an applicant's preparation for graduate work in psychology (e.g., Social Sci\u00ad ences 7 and 151A-B-C and Biological Sciences 80 and 81). Law. Most law schools prefer applicants with a broad and var\u00ad ied undergraduate preparation over those who have concen\u00ad trated their studies heavily in a narrowly specialized topic. Con\u00ad sequently, Social Ecology majors who plan on a career in law should take a diversified program of courses both within the Social Ecology program and in their non-Social Ecology elective courses (e.g., political science, economics, history, and a wide\u00ad ranging selection of courses in the sciences and the humanities). Social Ecology courses that are relevant to a career in in careers in adminis\u00ad ration or management in business, health care, or governmental agencies should consider selecting several of the following courses: 113, 166,E7,E82,E89,E113,E116,E118,E162, E168,E172,E177,E178,E192,J80,J132,J142,J182,S84, S86,S110,S126,S138,S161. Individuals interested in combining work in Social Ecology and a Master's degree in Administration may apply to the UCI Graduate School of Management for admission to their 3-2 Program. Such students must have completed all of the course requirements for the B.A. degree in Social Ecology by the end of their junior year. Applications should be made early in the junior year. During the senior year, students will take courses in administration which will count toward the 180 total units needed to receive the Bachelor's degree. Upon successful com- UC IRVINE - 1981-1982200 SOCIAL ECOLOGY pletion of the required courses and units, usually at the conclu\u00ad sion of four years of undergraduate study, the B.A. degree in Social Ecology will be awarded. The M.S. degree in Administra\u00ad tion will be awarded after successful completion of all require\u00ad ments for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. See page 228. Education. Students who plan to obtain a teaching credential or a higher degree in the field of education should consult with counselors in the Office of Teacher Education early in their col\u00ad lege careers. Students completing a B.A. in Social Ecology may qualify for a waiver of the Single Subject Credential Examination. Social Ecology courses that are relevant to a career in information about teaching credentials, see page 232. Urban Sociology and Criminology. The program of courses for students who are interested in careers or graduate education in urban sociology or criminology should include some of the course work is offered in the School of Social Sciences. Urban and Regional Planning. Social Ecology provides undergraduates with a broad preparation for careers or graduate study in planning. Relevant courses include: 113, 166, E5, E6, E7,E30,E87,E89,E112,E114,E117,E141,E162,E168, E172,E176,E177,E18l,E182. Public Health. Social Ecology majors who are considering the possibility of graduate school in public health will want to include a number of the following courses in their be noted that a concentration in many graduate-level specialties within the field of public health requires a strong undergraduate preparation in the physical and biological sciences. Further information about appropriate prepa~ation for these and other graduate programs may be obtained from the Social Ecology Undergraduate Counseling Office. Undergraduate Major in Applied Ecology The Program in Social Ecology and the School of Biological Sciences offer a new program of undergraduate instruction .lead\u00ad ing to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology. The objective is to integrate concepts of theoretical ecology and environmental planning and resource management into an advanced educa\u00ad tional framework. By presenting an interdisciplinary approach, the curriculum furnishes a strong undergraduate foundation for students interested in advanced study in environmental planning and resources management. An Applied Ecology major receives the basic science training of a Biological Sciences major and utilizes these skills in a core of environmentally based courses taught in Social Ecology. These courses blend theoretically with applied knowledge. Social Ecology brings to this major a unique combination of courses in Environmental Quality and Health, Planning and Public Policy, and Law and Society. This combination, together with a strong biology background contributed by the School of Biological Sciences and a general science background contributed by the School of Physical Sciences, enables students selecting this major to pursue interdisciplinary learning experiences which are difficult to achieve within traditional disciplines. The first three years of the major are very structured, leaving the last year open for students to specialize in an area of their choice. The Applied Ecology major provides students with a compre\u00ad hensive treatment of basic ecological principles and their rele\u00ad vance to human needs. As an alternate pathway, students with an engineering perspective are encouraged to explore the pro\u00ad gram options in Environmental Engineering offered by the School of Engineering. Also, students are encouraged to explore the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, lead\u00ad ing to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences, offered by the School of Biological Sciences. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in Applied Ecology University Requirements: See page 14. Applied Ecology Requirements Biological Sciences 90, 101, 102, 102L, 103, 103L, 104, 104L, 105, 106, 106L, 120, either 171 or 174, and either 169 or 179; Chemistry 1A-B-C, 1LB-LC, 51A, and 51LA; Mathematics 2A\u00ad B and 7 Mathematics 2A-B and Social Ecology 10; Physics 3A-B, 3LA-LB; Humanities 1A-B-C, or another option of the lower-division Writing Requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) and a three-quarter sequence in either Humanities or Literature (Category IV, Humanistic Social Ecology or E146; and Social Ecology 197A and two quarters of Social Ecology E197. Students must attain at least a 2.0 grade point average in re\u00ad quired courses in Biological Sciences and Social Ecology, and a 2.0 grade point average in required upper-division courses in Biological Sciences and Social Ecology. NOTE: Students entering college prior to fall 1980 may follow the Core Curriculum numbered 101A-B-C-D-E-F; 101LA-LB\u00ad LC-LE-LF. Planning a Program of Study It is important that students take the required science courses early, in order that the science background may be utilized in the Social Ecology courses. There are many required courses, and the student must plan carefully. For initial academic advis\u00ad ing, students should consult the Social Ecology Counseling Office ( 544 Engineering Building) or the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Faculty academic advisors may be either Social Ecology or Biological Sciences faculty members. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Graduate Program in Social Ecology The Program in SOcial Ecology offers graduate education lead\u00ad ing to the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Students desiring a Ph.D. should apply directly for the Ph.D. program. Only individuals interested in the M.A. as their final degree in Social Ecology should apply for admission at the Mas\u00ad ter's level. The emphasis in Social Ecology graduate study is primarily upon theory and research which have implications for policy and social action. Clinical training is not offered. All applicants for either the M.A. or Ph.D. should submit under\u00ad graduate transcripts, three letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test scores, and a formal applica\u00ad tion to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research before February 1. Interested persons may call the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor, Jan Martin, (714) 833-5917, for further information. The Program in Social Ecology is organized around the study of contemporary problems in the social and physical environment. Problems are studied from the diversified viewpoints of a mul\u00ad tidisciplinary faculty, including specialists in community, envi\u00ad developmental psychology; planning; urban sociology; law; criminology; and public health. Graduate education emphasizes this multidisciplinary orientation rather than the focused perspective of a single discipline. Social Ecology is committed to an empirical approach to the study of social problems. Program evaluation, questionnaire and survey methods, field research, naturalistic observation, and quasi-experimental techniques are emphasized as much as labor\u00ad atory experimentation. A sampling of faculty research and teaching interests includes, but is not limited to, human stress, psychosocial aspects of physical and emotional health, program evaluation, economic change and behavioral disorders, atypical child development, effects of employment on adolescent social and cognitive devel\u00ad opment and adult well-being, police use of deadly force, legal sanctions and deterrence, white collar crime, effects of the phys\u00ad ical environment upon feelings and behaviors, childbearing decisions, urban decentralization, social support systems among the elderly, water quality, air quality, the use of scientific infor\u00ad mation in public policy formation, and environmental regula\u00ad tory processes. Collaborative research with faculty members is an important component of graduate education in Social Ecology. Prospective graduate students should contact the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor for more detailed information concerning the current research interests of Social Ecology faculty members. M.A. Program Each incoming Master's student is assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student discusses an individual program of grad\u00ad uate education. The program leading to the M.A. degree re\u00ad quires a thesis and satisfactory completion of seven app/oved courses (28 units), including the Seminar in Social Ecology (200), Research Methods (201), and at least one additional approved course in statistics or methodology. Other courses should be selected with regard to the student's academic and career objectives, and must be approved by the faculty advisor. SOCIAL ECOLOGY 201 The seven required courses must include at least five graduate courses to be exclusive of any directed study, independent study, or thesis courses (298, 299, or 295). One four-unit field study (297) course may be counted as one of the seven required courses. A grade of B or better must be achieved in all courses. Students are advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree, and a thesis committee appointed, after a review of their graduate work and thesis plans by a faculty committee. All M.A. stu\u00ad dents who have not advanced to candidacy will be formally eval\u00ad uated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each academic year. At that time the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the M.A. or cease study in the Program. Eval\u00ad uation of M.A. students who have advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the student's Master's thesis committee. One year of academic residence is required, but completion of all M.A. requirements, including a thesis approved by the student's committee, ordinarily takes about two years. The M.A. degree in Social Ecology may be useful in obtaining a variety of positions. Many recent M.A. graduates are now em\u00ad ployed in federal, state, county, city, and private agencies in such areas as planning, mental health and welfare, and proba\u00ad tion and parole. A number of students with the Master's degree in Social Ecology have entered Ph.D. programs at other universities. Ph.D. Program The doctoral program offers advanced training that prepares students for research and teaching positions. Graduates may be particularly qualified for positions with private or governmental agencies where they can bring advanced academic training, insight, and expertise to bear upon such issues as environmental quality, urban planning, criminal justice, and functional and dysfunctional social development. Students who enter with the normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree in four to five years. Each incoming Ph.D. student will be assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student should meet at least once every quarter to discuss an individualized program of graduate education. Required for all Ph.D. students are: Seminar in Social Ecology (200), Research Methods (201), two approved quarters of graduate-level statistics, Program Evaluation (291), and Issues -in Social Interventions (213). In addition to these six required core courses, doctoral students must also complete a minimum of six other approved graduate level courses before advancement to candidacy. These six addi\u00ad tional required courses are exclusive of any field study, directed study, independent study, or dissertation research courses ( 2 97, 298, 299, or 296). All Ph.D. students who have not been advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each year. At that time, the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the Ph.D., complete the M.A. degree only, or cease graduate studies in the Program. Evaluation of Ph.D. students advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the student's doctoral dissertation commit\u00ad tee. Prior to the award of the Ph.D., each doctoral student must serve as a Teaching Assistant under faculty supervision for at least two quarters. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Z02 SOCIAL EOOLOGY All Ph.D. students are required to complete a research project before advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The method of research may include experiments, questionnaire and survey studies, systematic field observation, computer simulation, etc. It is expected that students will begin this project during their ,first year in residence and that it will be completed during the second year. The written report of the project may be equiva\u00ad lent to a Master's thesis and may be submitted as such if the stlldent has been advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree. Also required for the Ph.D. degree in Social Ecology is a written review of the literature relevant to a social or environmental problem or process. This paper constitutes the written portion of the qualifying examination. In meeting this requirement the student works closely with a committee of three Social Ecology faculty members. The scope and boundaries of the literature review are determined by the student in consultation with committee members. The literature review paper and the doc\u00ad toral dissertation often deal with closely related topics; there\u00ad fore the same faculty members frequently serve on the commit\u00ad tees responsible for guiding and approving these steps in the doctoral program. A student may be formally advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. when the literature review paper and the student's dissertation plan have been approved by the candidacy committee appointed by the Graduate Dean on behalf of the Graduate Council. The student will appear before this committee for an oral examina\u00ad tion. The dissertation plan will include a thorough examination of the history of the problem being proposed for investigation (often, part or all of the review paper completed earlier); its current status; the way in which the proposed research will further knowledge; a detailed specification of the proposed method of approach to the problem; and a description of the planned methods for analyzing research findings. Formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. will be made by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon recom\u00ad mendation by a unanimous vote of the student's candidacy committee. Alternatively, the committee may recommend a course of action to strengthen the student for advancement to candidacy at a future date. When the student is advanced to candidacy, a doctoral committee will be appointed in the name of the Graduate Council. The doctoral committee, ordinarily consisting of three members of the faculty, will supervise the preparation and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The dissertation should be completed and accepted within one to two years, and no later than three calendar years after the stu\u00ad dent's advancement to candidacy.

Tohoku University, Visiting Lecturer in Electrical Engineering (solid state electronics) The School of Engineering offers undergraduate and graduate programs of study for men and women who will engage in the professional practice of engineering as it relates to design, development, research, other engineering functions, and teach\u00ad ing in industry, government, or a university. Programs at all lev\u00ad els emphasize the fundamentals underlying engineering, thus enabling the graduates to continue professional development through formal or informal study. Thus, programs of study in the School of Engineering endeavor to provide UCI graduates with adequate intellectual tools for entrance into the profession and for continued renewal of their technical knowledge. At the undergraduate level a single program in Engineering is offered with options in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engi\u00ad neering, all of which are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (formerly the Engineers' Coun\u00ad cil for Professional Develvpment). In addition, an undergradu\u00ad ate double option of Environmental Engineering in conjunction with either the Civil Engineering or the Mechanical Engineering option is available. ENGINEERING 213 Courses in computer engineering and digital systems are offered. in the Electrical Engineering option. Courses in computer sci\u00ad ence are offered by the Department of Information and Com\u00ad puter Science (ICS). Students can declare a double major in Engineering and ICS. Early consultation with the School on this and other double-major programs, including the 3-2 Program with\u00b7 the Graduate School of Management, is advisable. The Engineering program provides a firm background in the basic sciences through courses in physics, mathematics, and chemistry; a fundamental un-derstanding of the engineering sci\u00ad ences through the required engineering core courses; and spe\u00ad cialization via technical electives. The breadth requirement must be taken in the areas of Humanistic Inquiry, Social and Behav\u00ad ioral Sciences, and Writing. At the graduate level, programs of study become less structured and specialization becomes more intense. The M.S. program requires 36 units to be completed, but the exact choice of the courses will be formulated through consultation between the student and the faculty advisor. Thesis and nonthesis programs are available. At the Ph.D. level the program is still less struc\u00ad tured but more specialized than at the M.S. level. There is no set course requirement; rather, students must demonstrate vari\u00ad ous competencies as they progress toward the completion of their doctoral programs. Engineering students may join any of a number of student organizations. Most of, these organizations are professionally oriented and have relationships to national engineering societies. A primary function of these groups is to provide regular techni\u00ad cal and social meetings for students with common interests. Most of them also participate in the annual Engineering Week activities held each year in February and in other School functions. Engineering student organizations are the Engineering Society of UCI (ESUCI), student groups associated with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the Ameri\u00ad can Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ( ASME ), the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the Mexican-American Engineer\u00ad ing Society (MAES), the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), the honorary engineering societies Eta Kappa Nu and Chi Epsilon Mu (Tau Beta Phi), and the Dean's Cabinet. Composed of the various organizations, the Cabinet provides a direct communication link between the students and the Dean. Faculty and committee meetings (except those involving per\u00ad sonnel considerations) are open meetings; in addition to desig\u00ad nated student representatives, all students are encouraged and expected to participate in the development of School policy. Student evaluation of the quality of instruction is made each quarter. Degrees Engineering ............................. B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Undergraduate honors at graduation in the School of Engineer\u00ad ing are awarded on the basis of a minimum upper-division grade UC IRVINE - 1981-1982214 ENGINEERING point average of 3.5 for work completed at UCI and service to the School, service to the University, service to the community, or achievement in research projects. Approximately 1 percent of the graduating class shall be awarded summa cum laude, 3 per\u00ad cent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude, with no more than 12 percent being awarded honors. Undergraduate Program The undergraduate program leads to a B.S. degree in Engineer\u00ad ing, with an option in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering. A double option of Environmental Engineering in conjunction with either the Civil Engineering or Mechanical Engineering option may be obtained by satisfying the appropriate double option requirements. Admissions Students should plan to enter the Engineering program at UCI as freshmen or as juniors. The sequential nature of the Engi\u00ad neering program and the fact that many courses are offered only once a year also make it imperative that students begin their studies in a fall quarter. High school students wishing to enter the UCI Engineering pro\u00ad gram are advised to have completed four years of mathematics and one year each of physics and chemistry. That preparation is fundamental to success in the Engineering program, and is vital to receiving first consideration for admittance to the Engineer\u00ad ing major during periods of restricted enrollments. Applicants should designate Engineering (and possibly an option such as Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical) as their intended major. If enrollment limitations make it necessary, some freshman applications may be redirected to another UC campus which can still accommodate freshman Engineering applicants. Op\u00ad tionally, freshman applicants subject to redirections can ask for admission to a special two-year program offered by the Physics Department at UC Riverside. Completing this program with at least a 2.40 grade point average guarantees transfer to the UCI School of Engineering as a junior. Transfer students can be admitted to the School of Engineering upon completion of a lower-division program elsewhere at UCI or at another college, including community colleges. Students seeking admission to the School of Engineering from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy the University requirements for admission to advanced standing and must have completed appropriate prerequisites for the junior-level courses to be undertaken in the School. These include courses equiva\u00ad lent to Mathematics 2A-B-C and 3A-B-D; Engineering 10; and six science courses with laboratories selected from Physics SA\u00ad B-C-D-E, Chemistry 61A-B (or Chemistry lA-B-C), but cover\u00ad ing Physics SA-B-C as a minimum. (The typical equivalent at most colleges is a three-or four-semester physics sequence plus a two-semester chemistry sequence, each for majors in those fields. Students planning to study electrical engineering at UCI need a course in modern physics that is equivalent to UCI Phys\u00ad ics SD. If the student's physics preparation did not include such a course, Physics SD can, subsequently, be taken at UCI.) Completion of these minimum requirements does not guarantee admission to the UCI Engineering program, because enrollment limitations in various categories of Engineering may dictate selection based on ranking by academic proficiency. Transfer students satisfying the Statewide Articulations Agree\u00ad ment on Lower-Division Engineering Requirements (California Community Colleges-California State Universities and Colleges\u00ad University of California) may complete the remaining require\u00ad ments for the B.S. degree in six quarters at UCI, assuming nor\u00ad mal progress is maintained. Students coming from community colleges which do not offer engineering courses approved under this agreement should arrange for early consultation with the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office so that a smooth transition can be planned, including perhaps some summer courses. Advising Academic advising is available from the academic counselors and the peer advisors in the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office of the School. Freshmen and sophomores will find that most of their questions can be answered by the counselors, who also approve their programs of study. Juniors and seniors must have their programs of study approved by their faculty advisors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 14. School Requirements Credit for at least 180 quarter units including the following: Engineering Core: Twenty-four units-Engineering 10, BOA\u00ad B-e, and lOlA-B. Courses in Engineering and Technical Subjects other than the Core: Sixty units, of which no more than eight may be at the lower-division level (i.e., numbered below 100). The number of courses and units which are specified vary between options. Courses which are not specified are labeled \"Technical Electives\" in the table of required subjects. Technical Electives are defined as courses in engineering, computer science, mathe\u00ad matics, physics, chemistry, or biological sciences, acceptable toward those majors. Where there is a choice, the course selec\u00ad tion must be made in consultation with the student's faculty advisor. If none of the accredited options is followed, the entire segment of 60 units must be approved by the Undergraduate Studies Committee. Mathematics: Twenty-four units-Mathematics 2A-B-C laboratory units-no less\u00b7 than six courses, with laboratory where appropriate, from Physics SA-B-C-D-E, Chemistry 61A-B (or lA-B-C), and Bio\u00ad logical Sciences lOlE. Excess units acquired through laboratory work may be assigned to Electives (see below). It is recom\u00ad mended that Engineering students take more than this min\u00ad imum and complete both the Physics 5 and Chemistry 61 sequences. Breadth: Thirty-six units-approved three-course clusters in (a) Humanistic Inquiry, (b) Social and Behavioral Sciences, and (c) Writing. At least one Writing course must be taken at the UC IRVINE - 1981-1982ENGINEERING 215 Programs for Accredited Options Programs showing required subjects and typical sequences for accredited options are listed below. These programs are based on a rigid set of prerequisites, beginning with adequate preparation in high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Stud,ents who are not properly prepared or who wish to make changes for other reasons must have their programs approved by their advisors.

Note that the remaining breadth requirements stated there are satisfied by the courses in Mathematics and Basic Sci\u00ad ences specified,above. Electives: Any 12 units with the following exceptions- ( a) physical education and (b) courses taken in preparation for the first required course in mathematics, chemistry, physics, or writing (as a breadth course). Duplication of Subject Material: Students who take courses which involve considerable duplication of subject material may not receive full graduation credit for all units thus completed. Residence Requirement: In addition to the University resi\u00ad dence requirement, at least 36 upper-division engineering units specified by each option must be completed successfully at the University of California. Variations: Variations from the degree requirements may be made subject to the approval of the faculty of the School. Stu\u00ad dents wishing to obtain variances should submit petitions to the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office. Programs of Study A student who wishes to graduate from one of the accredited options-Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering-should select the engineering and basic science courses listed in the respective program of study. Additional information on oppor\u00ad tunities within each option is available from faculty advisors and academic counselors. Students will work out suitable pro\u00ad grams of study with their faculty advisors. Students must realize that they alone are responsible for the planning of their own programs and for satisfactory completion of the graduation requirements. Students may substitute courses of their choosing for those required if they can substantiate the merits of the program of study and obtain the approval of the faculty of the School. Students are cautioned about the structure of prerequisites which underlies most engineering courses. The sample programs shown here constitute preferred sequences which take into account all prerequisites. Students in the School of Engineering, in accordance with gen\u00ad eral campus policy, are permitted to take courses in certain areas on a Pass/Not Pass basis. With respect to programs in engineering, such areas are the breadth courses, except for courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI Writing Requirement; any nontechnical electives; and any courses not submitted as fulfilling the graduation requirement (including technical elec\u00ad tives beyond the number required). Proficiency Examinations A student may take a course by examination with the approval of the faculty member in charge of the course and the Dean of the School. Normally, ability will be demonstrated by a written or oral examination; if a portion of the capability involves laboratory exercises, the student may be required to perform experiments as well as to take a written examination. Double Options for Environmental Engineering A significant feature of these double options is the provision for the broad interdisciplinary education necessary to deal with contemporary environmental engineering problems. The stu\u00ad dent may obtain the Environmental Engineering option from one of two possible paths-from either the Civil Engineering or Mechanical Engineering option-by satisfying additional course work from the Environmental Engineering core. By suitable choice of the courses taken as electives in either the Civil or Mechanical Engineering option, a student may complete most of the requirements for the second option in Environmental Engineering as part of the process of meeting the basic require\u00ad ments for the B.S. degree in Engineering. Specifically, the dou\u00ad ble option requirement can be satisfied by either of the following: Civil and Environmental Engineering In addition to the requirements in the Civil Engineering option, the student must successfully complete 24 units from the fol\u00ad lowing Engineering and Reporting); ME164 (Air Pollution and Control); CE166 (Public Health Aspects of Environmental Quality); ME169 (Vibration and Noise Con\u00ad ME119 (Nuclear Power Generation); ME124 (Solar Engineering). Mechanical and Environmental Engineering In addition to the requirements in the Mechanical Engineering option, the student must successfully complete 24 units from the following Engineering group: CE172 (Water Supply and Hydraulic Systems); CE120 (Environmental Impact Assessment and Reporting); CEl 73 (Water Resources and Water Quality); ME164 (Air Pollution and Control); CE 166 (Public Health Aspects of Environmental Quality); ME169 (Vibration and Noise Control); MEllO (Combus\u00ad Power Generation); ME124 (Solar Engineering). The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding UCI undergraduate engineering students may enter a cooperative 3-2 Pr0gram with the Graduate School of Man\u00ad agement. Students in this Program will complete their first three years in the School of Engineering and the final two years jointly in the School of Engineering and the Graduate School of Management. Successful completion of the requirements leads to a B.S. degree in Engineering and a Master's degree in Admin\u00ad istration. Students wishing to enter the 3-2 Program should consult with both the School of Engineering and the Graduate School of Management prior to, or early in, the junior year. Undergraduate Acceleration toward the M.S. Degree in Engineering Exceptionally promising seniors may, with permission of the Undergraduate Study Committee, take graduate-level Engineer- UC IRVINE - 1981-1982- ing courses in addition to the undergraduate degree require\u00ad ments. After attaining the B.S. degree and upon acceptance to the M.S. program in Engineering, the student may petition for application of up to eight units of excess credit toward the M.S. degree. If the petition is approved by the School and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, the student could complete the M.S. degree in three quarters of residence as a graduate stu\u00ad dent even while serving as a teaching or research assistant. Graduate Program Graduate study is offered leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering. The graduate program has concentrations in civil, electrical, mechanical, and environmental engineering. Civil engineering focuses upon structural mechanics; transporta\u00ad tion, planning, and urban systems; and water resources. The concentration in electrical engineering includes electronics, electro-acoustics and electro-optics, digital systems, telecom\u00ad munications, control systems, and electric energy systems. Mechanical engineering specialties include heat transfer, fluid dynamics, materials, combustion, and solar energy. Environ\u00ad mental engineering is an interdisciplinary concentration with a focus on water quality, air resources, environmental impact, and occupational health and safety. Studies in operations research can be carried out through interdisciplinary courses offered by several academic units. Admissions For information on requirements for admission to graduate study at UCI, see page 22. Admission to graduate standing in the School of Engineering is generally accorded those possessing a B.S. degree in Engineering or an allied field obtained with an acceptable level of scholarship from an institution of recognized standing. Those seeking admission without the prerequisite scholarship record may, in some cases, undertake remedial work; if completed at the stipulated academic level, they will be admitted to full graduate standing. Those admitted from an allied field may be required to take supplementary upper\u00ad division courses in basic engineering subjects. The Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test is required of all applicants. Master of Science in Engineering The M.S. degree is normally attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis, or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. For the M.S. degree with thesis, a minimum of 36 approved units are required, of which at least 20 must be nonresearch graduate units (courses numbered 200-289). A maximum of eight M.S. thesis research units (296) may be submitted. The M.S. thes'is must demonstrate the student's capability of undertaking an original study and carrying it through to a conclusion satisfac\u00ad tory to at least three members of the faculty. For the M.S. degree with comprehensive examination, a minimum of 36 approved units are required, of which at least 24 must be non\u00ad research graduate units (numbered 200-289). The detailed pro\u00ad gram of study for each M.S. student is formulated in consulta\u00ad tion with an advisor who takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate and the specific requirements . of the School. Students should acquaint themselves with core ENGINEERING 217 course requirements in the various concentrations of the M.S. program. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. Full-time students should be able to complete the requirements for the M.S. degree in three to four quarters. Part .. Time Study Those students who are employed may pursue the M.S. degree on a part-time basis, carrying fewer units per quarter. Since prior approval of part-time programs is required and since Uni\u00ad versity residence requirements necessitate the successful com\u00ad pletion of a minimum number of units in graduate or upper\u00ad division work in each of at least three regular University quar\u00ad ters, the part-time student should seek the advice of the gradu\u00ad ate student counselor in the School of Engineering. Full student fees are required of graduate students in residence regardless of the number of units taken. M.S. programs must be completed in four calendar years from the date of admission. Students tak\u00ad ing courses in University Extension should consult the section on Transfer of Courses below. Transfer of Courses Upon petition a limited number of graduate-level courses taken through University Extension, on another campus of the Uni\u00ad versity, or in another accredited university may be credited toward the M.S. degree after admission. With the exception of work undertaken in another Graduate Division of the Univer\u00ad sity, transfer credit will not .be applied to the minimum required units in ZOO-series courses. For further information, see page 27. Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with an ad\u00ad visory committee which takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. There are no specific course requirements, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty of the School; passage of the preliminary examination assessing the student's background and potential for success in the doctoral program; satisfaction of the teaching requirements required of all doctoral students; research preparation; formal advancement to candidacy; completion of a significant research investigation; and preparation and defense of an acceptable dissertation. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. Financial aid, such as research and teaching assistantships, is available.

In addition to the other requirements, Ph.D. applicants are required to submit a previously prepared paper (research report, Master's thesis, essay, case study) which may be indicative generally of the . applicant's interests and capabilities. MANAGEMENr 227 UC IRVINE - 1981-1982228 MANAGEMENT Educational Objectives Three basic premises underlie the School's philosophy of generic graduate education. First, there are significant phe\u00ad nomena and problems common to business, educational, and governmental organizations; second, a common set of disci\u00ad plines, concepts, techniques, and technologies exist which are appropriate to a wide range of organizational or scholarly roles; third, many administrators in the future will work in more than one of the three arenas during their careers. Regardless of the content of particular courses, it is expected that all degree candidates will be exposed to and have the ability to use the following: General Knowledge. The broad context of organizations and management; the late twentieth century (significant trends, con\u00ad ditions, and problems); history of science, scientific inquiry, and the philosophy of science; economic, political, and social analysis. Conceptual and Empirical Knowledge of Organizations. Basic concepts of management; the structure and functions of organizations, including comparative analysis and interorganiza\u00ad tional relations; levels and units of decision making; individual behavior and group norms; operating environments of organizations. Specific Knowledge of Particular Arenas of Administra\u00ad tion. In-depth study of specific institutional environments for administrative practice, such as governmental and business organizations, and other types of organizations. Mathematics and Statistics. As tools of precise reasoning, as languages which will tend more and more to dominate profes\u00ad sional and scholarly literature, and above all, as foundations for relevant quantitative methods. Technical Bases of Management. Decision processes; opera\u00ad tions research; systems and policy analysis; techniques; personnel policies; techniques for mea\u00ad suring and affecting attitudes and behavior; research design and strategies. Management Information Systems. Computer technology, information sciences, and basic computer applications. General Skills. Political skills, effective management of inter\u00ad personal relations, leadership strategies and tactics, and compe\u00ad tence in oral, graphic, and written expression. Professional Orientations. Identification of factors, values, and policies which might bear on successful, responsible, and intellectually honest performance of organizational roles. Recognition of the administrator's potential contributions to society and of ethical and moral problems which arise from social research and the management of human enterprises. Undergraduate Course Offerings The GSM faculty offers a limited number of courses for under\u00ad graduates each year, although there is no undergraduate degree program in administration available at UCI at this time. Examples of these courses include Introduction to Administra\u00ad tion, Introduction to Managerial Accounting, and Basic Quan\u00ad titative Methods for Administration. Students should refer to the listings under the Graduate School of Management in the Schedule of Classes, available each quarter from the Registrar's Office. In establishing the GSM undergraduate course offerings, the faculty anticipated three types of students drawn to courses in administration: ( l) students who wish to learn about the admin\u00ad istration of organizations as a way of gaining appreciation for a significant aspect of the culture, (2) students preparing for careers in other fields that require some knowledge of adminis\u00ad tration but not a high concentration in the field, and ( 3) stu\u00ad dents who expect to go on to graduate work in administration and who wish early guidance and undergraduate work appro\u00ad priate to this career objective. The 3 .. 2 Program for Undergraduates In addition to the two-year Master's program for students who have already received a bachelor's degree from this University or another institution, outstanding UCI undergraduate students may enter a cooperative 3-2 Program with GSM and other campus units such as the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, the School of Biological Sciences, the Program in Social Ecology, or the Department of Information and Com\u00ad puter Science. Acceptance into the 3-2 Program constitutes advance admission to the graduate program. Such students complete their undergraduate major requirements by the end of the junior year. During their senior year, they take graduate courses in GSM. These courses are used to satisfy their under\u00ad graduate unit requirements, and at the same time apply toward their graduate degrees. Successful completion of the require\u00ad ments in the program normally leads to the bachelor's degree in the cooperating discipline after the fourth year, and a Master's degree after the fifth year. Students contemplating entering such a program should contact the Graduate School of Management prior to, or early in, the start of the junior year, for the purpose of program consultation. NOTE: With the exception of 3-2 students, no undergraduates will be enrolled in. GSM graduate-level courses. Master's Degree Programs in GSM In addition to the Master of Science in Administration, GSM anticipates approval of two new degrees for the Masters level, effective fall1981. These will be the M.B.A. (Master of Business Administration), and the M.P.A. (Master of Public Administration). All three will require a minimum of 23 quarter courses (92 units) with a minimum overall grade point average of 3.0 in Core, Tier II, and elective courses. The Master's degree programs normally take two full academic years or their equivalent in part-time registration. Students with substantial personal or professional commitments normally take two courses per quarter and are required to complete the Mas\u00ad ter's degree in no more than four years. To accommodate the needs of these students, GSM offers a number of courses each quarter during the late afternoon and evening hours. Students who cannot take courses in the late afternoon (after 4:00p.m.) may not be able to complete the program successfully. There is no thesis required. The courses in the Master's degree programs are divided into three groups, each group designed to achieve UC IRVINE - 1981-1982specific educational objectives. The courses are divided as fol\u00ad lows: Tier I, Common Core Courses, which are required of all Master's degree students; Tier II B courses, which will be required for the M.B.A. degree; and Tier II P courses, which will be required for the M.P.A. degree. For the M.S. degree, the student is required to take all of Tier II B and II P courses. The balance of the minimum required 23 courses will consist of electives. Tier I Common Core Courses The first group consists of 10 Core courses (Tier I) taken by all Master's degree students. The Core has two fundamental aims: ( 1) to develop skills needed to select and use effectively the appropriate means, methods, and techniques for diagnosing and solving organizational problems; (2) to identify the significant concepts and phenomena associated with the study of complex organizations, and to bring to bear the relevant contributions of the core disciplines on the analysis of organizations and the administrative processes. Tier I Common Core Courses, each of which is four units, are: Management of Complex Organizations, Quantitative Methods for Management, either Quantitative Methods for Management or Statistics for Management, Organizational Analysis for Man\u00ad agement, Accounting Information for Management, Micro\u00ad economics for Management, Macroeconomics for Management, Political Analysis for Management, Computer and Information Systems for Management, Public/Private Interactions. Specialization in Business Management, Public Management, or Business/Public Management Students pursuing the M.B.A. will be required to take all four Tier II B courses: Business Strategy, Marketing for Management, Corporate Finance, and Production Management. Students pur\u00ad suing the M.P.A. will be required to take all four Tier II P courses: Public Policy Making, Public Policy Analysis, Public Financial Analysis, and Public Productivity Management. Stu\u00ad dents pursuing the M.S. are required to take all eight of the Tier II courses. Tier II courses are designed to increase the students' skills in the particular arena they wish to enter, as well as to present them with the problems and options common to high\u00ad level managers. The separation of the M.B.A. and M.P.A. degrees allows for a certain amount of specialization; the M.S. degree is structured to present the widest view of the interface between public and private management. Elective Courses The remaining coursework for the Master's degrees will consist of either nine additional electives for the M.B.A. or M.P.A. degrees, or five electives for the M.S. degree. The major empha\u00ad sis in the elective courses will be to develop additional depth in a discipline or interdisciplinary area or specialized competence in the use of a particular set of technical tools and methods. The student will select the electives in light of the student's edu\u00ad cational and career goals and interests. Management Internship Program To complement the academic curriculum of GSM, a Manage\u00ad ment Internship Program provides practical application and work experience to selected GSM Master's students. Student MANAGEMENr 229 interns are employed in administrative positions by local coop\u00ad erating organizations. Course credit is available for participants in the Internship Program through the course \"Management Internship Seminar.\" GSM faculty and organizational represen\u00ad tatives as well as student interns participate in this seminar which deals with specific topics and projects encountered by the interns in their positions. Special Opportunities Opportunities for students to take part in on-going research exist through two University-wide research units based on the Irvine campus. Through the Public Policy Research Organiza\u00ad tion (PPRO) a student may participate in research on significant public policy issues. Current projects include a nationwide study of local government information systems. The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) conducts research in the areas of urban transportation policy and planning, transit management and labor relations, and transportation system evaluation. Stu\u00ad dents interested in these areas may have an opportunity to work on an ITS project. Doctor of Philosophy in Administration Students who have completed the GSM Master's degree (or who have obtained a Master's degree elsewhere in an area of administration) are eligible to apply for the GSM doctoral pro\u00ad gram. Requirements of the Ph.D. program include a broad knowledge of core disciplines as represented by the 14 core courses of the Master's degree program. In addition, the Ph.D. st;udent must qualify as a skilled researcher and must complete a significant exercise demonstrating these skills. Although there is considerable variation in the length of time beyond a Master's degree needed to complete the Ph.D., a real\u00ad istic range is three to four years. The Ph.D. program is divided into three phases: preliminary, qualification, and dissertation. The preliminary phase (which must be completed within four quarters) is designed to ensure that all Ph.D. students have (1) a thorough\u00b7knowledge of core materials; (2) knowledge of how to conduct research; and ( 3) a depth of knowledge in a basic disci\u00ad pline or tool relevant to administration (e.g., decision sciences, behavioral science models for administration). In the qualification phase the student prepares for dissertation research in an area of specialization. This phase is completed when an oral qualifying examination is passed and the candi\u00ad dacy committee recommen~ advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. There are no foreign language requirements in the GSM Ph.D. program. The dissertation phase involves a significant original research project which demonstrates the Ph.D. student's creativity and ability to launch and sustain a career of research. The disserta\u00ad tion attests to the scholarly objectives of the degree program. Undergraduate Courses 1 Introduction to Administration (4) F, S. Seminar, three hours.

Wynne, M.A. University of Washington, Supervisor of Teacher Education (early childhood and special education) Teacher Education programs lead to California teaching creden\u00ad tials as established by the Teacher Preparation and Licensing Law of 1970, known generally as the Ryan Act. It is possible for a graduate student c~ncurrendy to complete the require\u00ad ments for a teaching credential and to earn an advanced aca\u00ad demic degree: This requires admission to the Teacher Education program and the graduate program in which the degree will be sought. Early in their college career students should consult with coun\u00ad selors in the Office of Teacher Education to work out a long\u00ad range program that will lead to the teaching credentials. There are regular staff counselors on duty daily, and there is a peer counselor who is particularly prepared to advise undergradu\u00ad ates. Individual counselors are not assigned. Each quarter it is essential that graduate students check their progress in a coun\u00ad seling session with Ada L. Nix, Credentials Counselor. The Credential Program There are two types of basic teaching credentials: Single Subject Instruction Credential. \"Single subject instruction\" means the practice of assignment of teachers to specified subject matter courses, as is commonly practiced in UC IRVINE - 1981-1982California high schools and junior high schools. Teachers who are authorized for single subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach any subject in the authorized fields, at any grade level, but normally in a departmentalized secondary school. UCI is approved for this credential. Single Subject Instruction Credentials are authorized by the State of California in art, business, English/ drama, English, his\u00ad tory, homemaking, industrial arts, languages, mathematics, music, physical education, social science, biological science, physical science, and agriculture. Multiple Subject Instruction Credential. \"Multiple subject instruction\" means the practice of assignment of teachers to multiple subject matter instruction, as is commonly practiced in California elementary schools. Teachers who are authorized for multiple subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach in any self-contained classroom: preschool, kinder\u00ad garten, and grades 1-12 inclusive, but normally the assignment is in the elementary school. UCI is approved for this credential. In addition, there are three other types of credentials. These are the Specialist Credential, the Services Credential, and the Designated Subjects Credential: Specialist Credential. The Specialist Credential is a credential on top of a credential. It authorizes teaching in the specific spe\u00ad cialization area at any grade level from preschool through grade 12. In order to qualify for this credential, the applicant must have a valid basic teaching credential and complete a specialized program of professional preparation in an approved program. In the State of California there are seven specialist credential categories: early childhood, bilingual/ cross-cultural, mathe\u00ad matics, reading, agriculture, health science, and special educa\u00ad tion. For the Special Education Specialist Credential a person must complete one of five advanced specialization areas: learn\u00ad ing handicapped, physically handicapped, severely handicapped, communication, or gifted. UCI offers preparation for Specialist Credentials in early childhood education and in the special edu\u00ad cation areas of the learning handicapped, the physically handi\u00ad capped, and the severely handicapped. Services Credential. The Ryan Act provides for five categories of nonteaching credentials which authorize their holders to pro\u00ad vide specific nonclassroom services to public schools. Services Credentials are issued by the State in pupil personnel services, administrative services, health services, library services, and clinical-rehabilitative services. UCI is authorized to recommend for the Administrative Services and the Pupil Personnel Services Credentials. Designated Subjects. \"Designated subjects\" means the prac\u00ad tice of assignment of teachers to designated technical, trade, or vocational courses. UCI is not approved in this credential area. Credential Authorization The credentials authorized by the 1970 credential law are not determined by grade level (i.e., elementary and secondary) but by the type of instructional situation (multiple or single sub\u00ad ject). Each credential carries K-12 authorization. These creden\u00ad tials are awarded by the Commission for Teacher Preparation and Licensing upon recommendation of the UCI Office of 'ICACHER EDUCATION 233 Teacher Education and are required in order to teach or serve in a professional capacity in any public 54;hool in California. Minimum Requirements for the Teaching Credential The minimum requirements for the teaching credential are: 1. A baccalaureate or higher degree, in an area other than pro\u00ad fessional education, from an approved institution. 2. An approved program of professional preparation. This means a sequence of education courses, including an all-clay (full-time) assignment of a semester's duration in student teaching. 3. Passage of a subject matter examination or its waiver via an approved academic preparation. UCI academic programs are approved for most examination waivers. 4. Under certain conditions the passage of the College Level Examination Program is required. See a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for advice. 5. Demonstration of a knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading as validated by successful completion of a pro\u00ad gram of study. 6. A course or an examination dealing with the U.S. Constitu\u00ad tion. 7. A fifth year of study is still required, even though a student may elect to start or complete the approved program of profes\u00ad sional preparation as an undergraduate. Completion of the approved program as an undergraduate at UCI with a grade point average of 3.0 will support admission to graduate study (in UCI Teacher Education) for completion of the fifth-year requirement. The UCl Teacher Education pro\u00ad gram defines the fifth year as 45 quarter units of upper-division or graduate-level work taken after the bachelor's degree is granted. In each instance the fifth year will consist of a con\u00ad trolled program individually determined, based upon the assessed needs of the student as determined by the student, the Office of Teacher Education, and where applicable, the hiring school district. Passage of a Subject Matter Examination Single Subject Examinations. California requires all students to pass the National Teachers Examination (NTE) in the area of their teaching major except as a particular institution has devel\u00ad oped an approved major which waives the NTE. All UCI aca\u00ad demic majors which are commonly taught in the public schools have been waived in lieu of the National Teachers Examination. However, in some majors there are certain requirements that a student must complete while fulfilling the major in order to receive this waiver. Students should consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for detailed information. Supplementary Authorization. Teaching minors by that name no longer exist, but it is possible to add further teaching authorizations beyond the single subject major. Students decid\u00ad ing to be credentialed in more than one subject area may qualify to do so in either of two ways: UC IRVINE - 1981-1982234 TEACHER EDUCATION 1. Students may complete 30 quarter units (15 quarter units if they are upper-division) in collegiate-level course work to be used to develop a supplementary authorization to teach in areas differing from the single subject major. Consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for specifics. . 2. Students may pass the National Teachers Examination in any area of their choice and thus qualify for the supplementary authorization in that subject. Multiple Subject Examinations. A general subject matter examination authorizing teaching multiple subjects includes an examination of the candidate's knowledge of the following areas: English, social science, fine arts, science, and mathe\u00ad matics. The UCI program for the Multiple Subject Teaching Credential is approved for waiver of the examination if the stu\u00ad dent completes the required diversified program. See a coun\u00ad selor in the Office of Teacher Education. Multiple and Single Subject Credentials Multiple and Single Subject Credentials are of three types: The Preliminary Credential. The Preliminary Credential is awarded by the State upon completion of the approved pro\u00ad gram. This can be done in the undergraduate program and is contingent upon possession of the baccalaureate degree. Before the recommendation for the Preliminary Credential can be made, the student must have completed (or demonstrate equiva\u00ad lent credit) for the Multiple Subject Instruction Credential: Education 105A, 105LA, 110A-B, 173-174; for 101, 102, 105B, 105LB, 173-174. The Clear Credential. The Clear Credential cannot be awarded by the State until the completion of (a) a baccalaureate degree, (b) an approved program, and (c) a fifth year. The Life Credential. The Life Credential cannot be awarded by the State until the completion of all requirements for the Clear Credential plus a certain number of years teaching in Cali\u00ad fornia public schools. The Approved Program of Professional Preparation This program refers to education courses required for the State teaching credential. UCI defines the approved program as con\u00ad sisting .of 19 quarter units, plus student teaching. Six quarter units of this instruction are required to be in the teaching of reading. The professional preparation will contribute effectively to the experience, performance, and excellence of the candidates. The understandings and competencies in each of the required courses are attained through the provision of a wide variety of experiences designed to be most effective in providing the competency. Multiple Subject Instruction Credential Program (Elementary) Education 105A; Education 105LA; Education 110A-B; Educa\u00ad tion 173; Education Subject Instruction Credential Program Education 101; Education 102-the students enroll in the sec\u00ad Education 174; Education 320A-B-C-D-E. One of the above patterns will prevail for all candidates. The primary option will be the status of the candidate ( undergradu\u00ad ate or graduate) at entry. The programs are planned for inclu\u00ad sion in the undergraduate degree program, but can all be com\u00ad pleted in the fifth year. Field experience, including student teaching, is offerea in the regular four-year undergraduate program. UC Irvine is committed to the concept that the student should have a broad range of experi\u00ad ences in the schools and community as a part of any kind of college education. This is true not only in the area of Teacher Education but is a concept shared by most other academic units on the campus. Thus, the field experience is relatively easy to achieve for the student preparing to be a teacher. It should be started in the freshman or sophomore year. The Irvine Teacher Education Program suggests two field experi\u00ad ences prior to entering into student teaching. One such program might be becoming a tutor during the freshman or sophomore year and a teacher's aide in the junior year. There are numerous options for this field experience. Each field experience program is a cooperative arrangement between the University and the public school districts to help provide UCI students with experience that will prepare them for their future work as teachers. The field experience can come from any one of several academic areas in which students work in public schools under supervision of an experienced teacher in the school and with a University supervisor. As a tutor, the col\u00ad lege student will usually work with the public school student on a one-to-one basis. As a teacher's aide, the student will work for a block of time per week for a quarter with a teacher in the classroom. During this time students will be given a variety of opportunities to help the experienced teacher enrich the course of study and to participate within the classroom. Ultimately it is in the classroom where the problems of teaching are either solved or ignored; hence here is where teacher preparation begins. This experience will assist the UCI student in making a more realistic vocational choice. It will also involve the public school in the selection of future student teachers. Early in the junior year, when it is not too late for the UCI stu\u00ad dent to change a vocational choice without undue hardship, the University and the student should be in a position to make cer\u00ad tain decisions as to whether to continue in the educational sequence. An additional field experience of one unit value will be required of all students in Education 174, and this involvement must be in multicultural areas. Fifth-Year Requirement Regardless of courses completed prior to the bachelor's degree, students must complete a fifth year to obtain a clear teaching credential. In addition to the approved program listed above for the Multiple or Single Subject Instruction Credentials, the fifth year must include the following: UC IRVINE - 1981-19821. Completion of 45 quarter units 2. Completion of the following courses: a. Education 162, Psychology and Education of the Excep\u00ad tional Child b. Education 360, Synthesis of the Professional Commit\u00ad \u00b7ment c. Education 380, Health Education for Teachers Provision for a Student Teaching Experience Multiple Subject Instruction candidates will be assigned in grades K-8. The assignment will be split to include two levels within this range. Single Subject Instruction candidates will be assigned in grades 7-12. The assignment will be split to include two levels within this range. The student teaching situation requires the student to be in the school the full day the same as the regular teacher, including faculty meetings, parent conferences, and sponsorship of events for a full semester's duration. It is a joint responsibility of UCI and the school districts to guarantee that each student will have student teaching expe\u00ad rience in a multicultural or cross-cultural situation. There is no concurrent course work required of student teachers in addition to the student teaching. A weekly seminar is held as a part of the total student teaching program. Intern Teaching Credential Program Through the intern program, a student may earn a stipend for one year of teaching while completing either the multiple or sin\u00ad gle subject credential. To hold an Intern Teaching Credential in a school district, the student must be enrolled in the graduate program. Teacher candidates are selected by participating schools and the University based on the background and expe\u00ad rience of the teacher candidate, the needs of the particular school, and the candidate's eligibility for the University's gradu\u00ad ate program. The stipend is paid by the school district. The number of internships varies from year to year. For further information see the intern secretary in the Office of Teacher Education. Basic Information 1. Requirements for the candidate's admission to the program of teacher preparation are based on a broad index: Academic Achievement. A 3.0 overall grade point average is required for admission. Education on this campus is primarily a fifrh-year program although the student teaching program by law is open to undergraduate students who can properly arrange their course of study. In any event, a fifrh-year program is still required, and admission to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research is required for the completion of the fifrh year. Absence of Criminal Conviction that Would Preclude the Issuance of a Credential. At the time of admission to the program, a statement is issued concerning criminal conviction and obtaining a teaching credential. The document is clear and concise. There is a difference between being charged and being convicted. A fingerprint checking system is required by the State. lEACHER EDUCATION 235 Interview. An interview committee has been set up that is avail\u00ad able to meet with prospective students. All admitted to the pro\u00ad gram will have gone through a personal interview with a mem\u00ad ber or members of the committee. Written Recommendations. Three letters of recommenda\u00ad tion for admission are required. These recommendations are concerned -with the student's ability to do gradaate-level work and are not necessarily character references. These are the same kinds of letters that are required for entrance to any other cam\u00ad pus graduate program. Admission. Both the UCI academic department corresponding to the student's academic major and the Office of Teacher Edu\u00ad cation must recommend the admission of applicants for the Single Subject Instruction Credential. The applicant's record is reviewed first by the academic department and then by the Admissions Committee of the Office of Teacher Education. Prior Experience with Children and Youth Groups. Prior to acceptance of a student into student teaching, the student will be required to have had two quarters of experience elsewhere. 2. The approved program should be completed in its entirety at UCI, although equivalent course work taken elsewhere may be considered. Education courses taken at UCI prior to fall1974 are not acceptable in the new program. Students who have previ\u00ad ously completed such courses should consult a credential coun\u00ad selor. Any deviation must be cleared with a coUnselor. 3. For the Multiple Subject Instruction Credential, Education 105A, 105LA, 110A-B, 173, and 174 must be finished prior to student teaching. 4. For the Single Subject Instruction Credential, Education 101, 102, 105B, 105LB, 173, and 174 must be finished prior to student teaching. 5. Twenty quarter units of student teaching are defined as a full day, five days per week, for 18 weeks in the appropriate class\u00ad room training environment. Evaluation will be based on per\u00ad formance, excellence in instruction, and professional maturity. These factors will be assessed through a rigorous evaluation by the resident teacher, the supervising teacher, and the candidate. If competence cannot be reached by the conclusion of the stu\u00ad dent teaching program, the student will have failed to qualify for recommendation for credential certification by UCI. 6. Candidates desiring both Single and Multiple Subject Cre\u00ad dentials may apply the basic professional courses of Education 105A, 105LA, 173, 174, 360, and 380 toward both creden\u00ad tials, but must complete Education 101, 102, 110A-B, do stu\u00ad dent teaching in l:;oth areas, and demonstrate competence by passing appropriate State-mandated subject field examinations where needed. 7. Student Teaching Clearances: A student must apply for a student teaching assignment the quarter before student teaching. Students are to consult the Office of Teacher Education for appropriate information. Effective immediately all students are required by law to obtain a certificate of clearance from the Commission for Teacher Preparation and Licensing (located in Sacramento) prior to UC IRVINE - 1981-19822361EACHER EDUCATION beginning student teaching. This process is primarily a finger\u00ad print check to determine that the student is clear of a criminal conviction. See a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for advice on how to handle this complicated, time-consuming process. Clearances for student teaching are processed by the Office of Teacher Education and are contingent upon the certificate of clearance, a current health clearance, and academic preparation clearances. 8. Under the present program a student can be authorized to teach in California prior to the completion of the fifth year. A student can be granted a preliminary credential upon comple\u00ad tion of the B.A., the professional education sequence, a course in the teaching of reading, student t~ching, and where neces\u00ad sary, by passing the National Teacher Examination as required by the Ryan Act. Contact the Office of Teacher Education for information on the National Teacher Examinations. 9. The \"fifth year\" must be completed within five years after the preliminary credential is issued. 10. Commission-administered examinations for subject matter credential approval exist in most areas. The examination for the Multiple Subject Credential is the General Education Section of the Common Examinations of the National Teacher Examinations. The examination can be taken as often as necessary but should not be taken prior to the junior year. The General Education Section of the Common Examina\u00ad tions will cover the areas of Written Composition/English; Social Science/Fine Arts; and Mathematics/Science. Multiple Subject Instruction Credential Requirements in Academic Areas for Waiver of Examination 1. Of the student's total undergraduate program, 128 quarter hours are required to be divided as follows: Nine courses (36 quarter units) in two of the following areas and seven courses (28 quarter units) in the other two: a. English (including grammar, literature, composition, and speech) b. Social science and history (must have courses in each) c. Mathematics and science (must have courses in each with a minimum of three in mathematics) d. Fine arts, foreign language, and philosophy 2. Since on the UCI campus the academic major will normally fulfill one of the four areas above and the UCI breadth require\u00ad ment applies to the others, meeting the four requirements is not particularly difficult if planned early in the student's career. Bilingual/Cross Cultural Emphasis The Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis is a specialization in addition to a regular teaching credential. This means that a can\u00ad didate must fulfill all the necessary requirements for a regular State teaching credential whether this be with a single subject orientation for high school or a multiple subject orientation for elementary school. The Irvine program is limited to the devel\u00ad opment of a bilingual capacity in Spanish only, as the second language. At UCI the Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a B.A. with a Bilingualism and English as a Second Language Emphasis. By acquiring this undergraduate major, the student will complete a significant part of the specific requirements for a Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. This is the best kind of preparation for going into the program leading to a Bilingual/ Cross-Cultural Emphasis. Specialist Credentials Early Childhood Education Specialist Credential. The Early Childhood Education Specialist Credential is a specializa\u00ad tion on top of a regular Multiple Subject Instruction Credential. If the student can complete all the work, the student can obtain a preliminary teaching credential and an Early Childhood Spe\u00ad cialist Credential with the B.A., but it is not likely. In nearly every instance it will be obtained as a result of the fifth-year program. Special Education Specialist Credentials. UCI is approved for three areas of the Special Education Specialist Credential: Learning Handicapped; Physically Handicapped; and Severely Handicapped. Much of the work for the learning handicapped credential can be completed in the undergraduate years, thus allowing concurrent work between the basic teaching credential and the specialist credential. Services Credentials The Pupil Personnel Services Credential and the Administrative Services Credential are approved programs at UCI. Both cre\u00ad dentials are effective for grades K-12. At UCI the Pupil Person\u00ad nel Services Credential requires a basic teaching credential or a Master's degree in Social Ecology. A master's degree is a pre\u00ad requisite to securing the Administrative Services Credential. Courses 100A Educational Strategies for Tutoring and Teacher Aiding (4) F.

These objectives include: Providing an excellent education for medical students and residents resulting in the attraction and admission of candi\u00ad dates of the highest quality and in the graduation of medical students and graduate physicians who are judged by their peers and professors to be competent and knowledgeable; who pursue careers in areas of need ranging from provision of primary care in urban and rural areas to leadership in aca\u00ad demic medicine; and who are representative of the demog\u00ad raphy of California. Achieving a high level of scholarly research in the medical sciences and in the disciplines basic to medicine which results in nationally and internationally recognized conttibu\u00ad tions to fundamental knowledge; to prevention of disease; to diagnosis and therapy; to replacement of ineffective technol\u00ad ogies by scientific solution; to correction of health impairing behaviors; and to enhanced efficiency, effectiveness, and equity of health care services. Providing graduate and postdoctoral programs which com\u00ad plement our scholarly objectives and enterprise, which attract distinguished candidates, and which produce scien\u00ad tists, scholars, and teachers who will assume leadership roles in universities, research institutes, and other areas of public and private service. Cooperating with other segments of the educational system in rigorous programs for health science education, including programs in nursing, allied health, veterinary, dental, and continuing education. Strengthening and developing new approaches for continuing medical education by offering courses characterized by depth, comprehensive treatment of subject matter, and eval\u00ad uation of learning and teaching. Fulfilling with efficiency and sensitivity our committnent to provide exemplary medical services to all patients. Achieving a faculty of the quality, size, and diversity neces\u00ad sary to fulfill these objectives, supported by appropriate facilities and operational resources. Facilities The basic medical science insttuctional programs are located in modern, well-equipped buildings on the Irvine campus. These buildings also house the College of Medicine administration and many of the research laboratories and classrooms. In addition, facilities on the Irvine campus include two amphitheater-style lecture halls, the Medical Sciences Library, and a student lounge/activity center. The UCI Clinical Services System is comprised of the UCI Medical Center, two community clinics in areas of need within Orange County, and several affiliated hospitals and clinics in UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Orange County, in southern Los Angeles County, and in outly\u00ad ing areas. Its goal is to serve the community while also maintain\u00ad ing an environment of quality medical education and research. The UCI Medical Center provides a full range of medical and mental health experiences to medical students and residents, while the community clinics concentrate on the primary care specialties and the affiliated institutions provide clinical training in specific specialities. Plans are being formulated for an on\u00ad campus ambulatory care clinic which will provide primary care services'to the Irvine area and specialty services to a large geo\u00ad graphic area. UCI Medical Center The University of California Irvine Medical Center (UCIMC), located in the City of Orange, is a 493-bed comprehensive med\u00ad ical care center and is the principal clinical facility of the College of Medicine operated by the University. The medical faculty of the College of Medicine, together with the medical resident staff, provides the professional care at the Center. The following services are provided at the Center: medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, family medicine, pathol\u00ad ogy, radiology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, ophthal\u00ad mology, neurology, anesthesiology, and dentistry. The Center also has cardiac, pediatric, neonatal, respiratory, burn, and gen\u00ad eral intensive care units, and more than 90 specialty outpatient clinics are available. The Medical Center is also the designated countywide-Level I tertiary trauma referral center. A six-level addition to the main hospital building was opened last spring, and redevelopment plans call for the renovation of existing buildings and the construction of new facilities, includ\u00ad ing a medical library building. UCI Community Clinics Two University-operated clinics are located in Orange County. The Community Clinic of Orange County (CCOC), located in the City of Santa Ana, is the home of the Department of Family Medicine residency program. The Clinic currently provides comprehensive care for 26,000 outpatients annually. The North Orange County Community Clinic (NOCCC) currently serves 6,500 outpatients annually and is located in the City of Ana\u00ad heim. The affiliated Cllnica Sierra Vista, in Lamont, California, provides an educational experience in rural medicine. Affiliated Hospitals and Clinics Additional major teaching and research programs of the College of Medicine are conducted at tht; Veterans Administration Med\u00ad ical Center, Long Beach, and at Memorial Hospital Medical Center, Long Beach.

Letters of recommendation ftom college professors are invited at this time. Procedure for Admission The College is a member of the Association of American Medi\u00ad cal Colleges Applications Service (AMCAS). Requests for applications should be submitted directly tothe College. Appli\u00ad cations may be submitted at any time between june 1 and November 15 of the year preceding that for which admission is requested. No application for admission will be accepted which does not clearly indicate that all the required subjects will have been completed by the date of anticipated entrance. Tentative accep\u00ad tance may be given, but final acceptance is contingent upon actual evidence of satisfactory completion of courses. Failure to meet this requirement or falsification of information will be grounds for rejection or dismissal. The College Admissions Committee will review all AM CAS applications and may then request submission of additional material, including letters of recommendation, supplemental transcripts, a personal information form, two photographs, and a nonrefundable fee of $25. Nothing except the AM CAS appli\u00ad cation should be submitted until it has been requested by the College of Medicine. Applicants may expect to receive notification of acceptance or rejection any time from November until the beginning of the fall term. A list of alternates is maintained for possible ap\u00ad pointment if a vacancy occurs in the class for a given year. No other notifications regarding the status of an application should be anticipated. Recommended Acceptance Procedures of the Association of American Medical Colleges These acceptance procedures have been approved by the Execu\u00ad tive Council of the Association of American Medical Colleges upon recommendation of the Committee on Research and Edu\u00ad cation. Both applicants and schools are responsible for abiding by their spirit. 1. No offer of admission to medical school should be made to an applicant more than one year before entering the course of instrucrion offered by the medical schoo1.1 1Under special circumstances a school may make an offer more than one year before the expected entrance date to encourage the educa\u00ad tional development of the student, but all such offers should state explicitly that the student is completely free to apply to other schools at the usual time. 2. When offers are made to applicants, the students are re\u00ad quired to file a statement of intent within two weeks of the receipt of the offer. The statement of intent leaves the student free to withdraw if accepted by a preferred school up until the time of actual registration. 3. Each medical school should prepare and distribute to appli\u00ad cants and college advisors a detailed schedule of itS application and acceptance procedures and should adhere to this schedule unless it is publicly amended. 4. No medical school should use any device which implies that acceptance of its offer creates a moral obligation to enroll at that school. Applicants are free to deal with other schools and accept an offer from one of them even if a deposit has been paid and must be forfeited. Under all circumstances every accepted \u00b7 applicant does retain an obligation to notify a school promptly if the decision should Pe not to accept the offer, and to with\u00ad draw at once after accepting an offer from another school. 5. Each school is free to make appropriate rules for dealing with accepted candidates who without adequate explanation hold one or more places in other schools. These rules should recognize the problems of the student who has multiple offers, and also of those applicants who have not yet been accepted. No candidate for admission will be considered who has been dismissed from any college, university, or other professional school. If the applicant has attended another professional school, complete, official transcripts and a letter of honorable withdrawal from that school must be submitted. Notice of Acceptance The Dean of the College will notify the candidate of acceptance or rejection as soon as the application has received final action by the Admissions Committee. Accepted applicants must return a written statement of their acceptance of the College's offer within two weeks after receipt of the notice of acceptance. No advance deposit to hold a position in the class is required of applicants. The statement of intent to register leaves the student free to withdraw if accepted by a preferred school. This is in keeping with the recommendations of the Association of Amer\u00ad ican Medical Colleges. Information regarding \u00b7registration, rules and regulations, grad\u00ad ing procedures, requirements for academic advancement, and other facts will be provided to students in the student hand\u00ad book. Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education The College of Medicine participates in the student exchange program of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Edu\u00ad cation, under which qualified legal residents of \\JVestern states without medical schools are considered along with California residents, and these states of origin reimburse the State of Cali- UC IRVINE - 1981-1982fomia for the costs of their education. These states are Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming. To be eligible for this program, stu\u00ad dents must apply to the WICHE certifying officers in their own states. For addresses of certifying officers, write to the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, P.O. Drawer P, Boulder, Colorado 80302. Admission to Advanced Standing The College of Medicine has a few openings for transfer stu\u00ad dents. Applicants who have completed the equivalent of the first two years of the UCI College of Medicine curriculum will be considered by the Admissions Committee for admission to levels more advanced than the regular entering class level but not beyond the beginning of the third year. Applicants from U.S. medical schools are required to pass suc\u00ad cessfully Part I of the National Board Medical Examination. Foreign medical school applicants are required to pass success\u00ad fully the Medical Science Knowledge Profile Examination, and they may be offered a conditional acceptance which would enable them to take Part I of the National Boards. College of Medicine policy requires passage of Part I of the National Boards for matriculation to the third year. Applicants accepted on a conditional basis who do not pass the National Board Medical Examination will have their conditional acceptance withdrawn on the basis of their not having fulfilled the require\u00ad ments for admission to advanced standing. Those interested in applying should contact the College of Med\u00ad icine Office of Admissions and Records for applications and further information. Applications can be made up to March IS of the year in which admission is sought. Requirements for the M.D. Degree Each medical student must satisfactorily complete the required basic medical sciences, preclinical sciences, and clinical sciences courses of instruction, as well as acceptable electives. Passage of Part I and Part II of the National Boards is required at desig\u00ad nated points in the curriculum for promotion to the next aca\u00ad demic level. Upon recommendation of the faculty and with the Dean's con\u00ad currence, the student is awarded the M.D. degree. Medical Curriculum The M.D. curriculum requires four years to complete. With permission, exceptionally qualified students may shorten their completion time. Conversely, if special needs are identified the time may be extended to five years. This latter option is advan\u00ad tageous to those students who wish to pursue an M.D. /Ph.D. program, to those who feel they have educational deficiencies, or to those who have other impelling demands on their time. The instructional year is divided into quintiles (fifths) of 9-11 weeks each, and the program is composed of 1 7 instructional quintiles. The instructional quintiles and courses of study are grouped as follows: Basic Medical Sciences (Quintiles 1-5) During quintiles 1-5, no more than six hours of instruction are scheduled per day, and of these six hours, no more than four are formal lectures. MEDICINE 251 Gross Anatomy; Embryology; Histology; Neuroanatomy. The language of medicine is taught by studies of gross human anatomy, human neuroanatomy, embryology, and normal microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy is taught through a regional approach with heavy emphasis on laboratory dissection augmented by lectures, demonstrations (radiographic films), and teaching aids. Neuroanatomy is functionally oriented and emphasizes both laboratory and lecture material. Microscopic anatomy is designed to provide students with knowledge of cel\u00ad lular morphology and function in preparation for studies in pathology. All courses in anatomy are given a clinical orientation. Biochemistry. The fundamentals of classical and molecular biochemistry are covered, including the structure, function, and biosynthesis of macromolecules and metabolic interrelations. The molecular mechanisms responsible for regulation at the transcriptional, translational, posttranslational, and enzymatic levels are emphasized. Behavioral Sciences I and II. The ultimate goal of the curric\u00ad ulum is for the student to learn the behavioral aspects of medi\u00ad cine as they apply to general medical and surgical practice. The areas covered are the basic science of neurobiology, somato\u00ad psychic issues, interpersonal (doctor-patient) relationships, and psychopathology. Behavioral Sciences I covers normal human development, the basics of the doctor-patient relationship, basic interviewing techniques, and behavioral neuroanatomy and neurochemistry. Behavioral Sciences II covers human sexuality, psychopathology, alcoholism, and drug abuse. It also covers psychosocial aspects of medical and surgical disease. The courses consist of readings, lectures, and small group discus\u00ad sions. Students also have their first exposure to patients and learn the basics of the interview. In Behavioral Sciences I the emphasis is on interviewing \"normal\" people; in Behavioral Sci\u00ad ences II the student learns how to assess pathology. Physiology. The course consists of lecture, tutorial, and audio\u00ad visual presentations of the classical concepts of vertebrate phy\u00ad siology, with emphasis on the function of normal tissues in man. Specific topics related to neurological, cardiovascular, res\u00ad piratory, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, exercise, and temperature regulation are presented. Microbiology. This course deals with the biochemical and genetic properties of infectious agents, activities of toxins, chemotherapy, and the biochemistry and genetics of antibiotic resistance. A considerable portion of the course deals with the humoral and cellular basis of immunity and the genetic control of the immune response. The course also includes an in-depth study of the biology of parasites and the structure and activity of viruses. Community and Environmental Medicine. This course consists of five main segments: biostatistics, epidemiology, pre\u00ad ventive medicine, legal medicine, and environmental and occu\u00ad pational medicine. The primary segment, epidemiology, is pre\u00ad sented in formal lectures and laboratory sessions. Methods are given for evaluating the distribution and possible causation of acute and chronic diseases, including infections and noninfec\u00ad tious diseases, in human populations. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982Preclinical Sciences (Qpintiles 6-8) During quintiles 6-8, no more than seven hours of instruction will be scheduled each day, and of these no more than four will be formal lecture. Pharmacology. The preclinical course in pharmacology deals with drugs of various classifications that are used for specific or symptomatic therapies of disease states. Emphasis is on the mechanisms of action of drugs at the organ or system level and on their use in medical therapy. This course includes lectures and laboratory demonstrations that illustrate pharmacologic principles, supplemented by small group discussion sessions. Pathology. Theoretical aspects of pathological processes are presented to provide an orientation to disease mechanisms which are correlated with practical laboratory work. Disease is presented as a dynamic process that affects the organism at molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels. Examination of Patient. Basic instruction and experience are offered in the elements of physical diagnosis and patient interviews. Mechanisms of Disease. An organ system approach is utilized in presenting the basic mechanisms and manifestations of disease. Introduction to Medicine. This course introduces students to comprehensive work-ups of their own patients, including his\u00ad tory, complete physical examination of all organ systems, and differential diagnostic analysis and interpretation. Introduction to Surgery. In order to attain the maximum benefit from the basic surgical course, students are oriented to the method, approach, and history of surgery and to specific surgical problems. Clinical Sciences (Quintiles 9-1 7) The clinical experience is composed of clerkship rotations, with a specific allotment of time emphasizing primary care and con\u00ad tinuity of care. Sequencing of clerkships is determined by the Office of Admissions and Records. One and one-half quintiles are undesignated, and students may take electives that suit their particular interests, needs, and goals. These courses must be approved by the student's advisor and the Office of Admissions and Records and, by petition, a number may be taken at institu\u00ad tions other than UCI. Anesthesiology. During the anesthesiology clerkship, students receive instruction in the basic principles of general and regional anesthesia, including the pharmacology of anesthetic drugs, basic respiratory and cardiovascular physiology, airway man\u00ad agement, preoperative evaluation of patients, surgical anesthesia, fluid balance, hazards of anesthesia, postanesthesia recovery care, resuscitation, and the management of respiratory emergen\u00ad cies and comatose states. A two-week elective is offered in which students gain familiarity with the technical aspects of anesthesia by spending a portion of each day in the operating room and by participating in supervised \"hands-on\" patient care. Theoretical aspects of the specialty are covered in daily tutorial sessions with the faculty, and students attend depart\u00ad mental clinical conferences which are devoted to presentation and discussion of interesting cases and complications. Special rotations through the Long Beach Veterans Administration Medical Center Surgical Intensive Care Unit are offered but must be arranged through the department chair; the student must nave at least one week on clinical anesthesia as a prerequi\u00ad site for the elective. Dermatology. The dermatology clerkship provides students the opportunity to learn the common dermatologic diseases. Development of disease recognition, diagnostic skills, and out\u00ad patient management of skin problems are emphasized during this rotation. Students attend inpatient teaching rounds, grand rounds, and slide conferences, and visit private physician offices. Outpatient care under the supervision of the chief resi\u00ad dent and faculty is assigned at UClMC and Long Beach Vet\u00ad erans Administration Medical Center clinics. During the weekly basic science and journal club conferences, students learn advances in scientific understanding of dermatologic diseases and their therapy. Medicine. Students are taught the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approach to commonly encountered medical illnesses with the intent that, in addition to scientific aspects of medical diagnosis and therapy, they will develop an appreciation for the importance of psychosocial-economic factors in the care of the patient. Experience is provided with common medical procedures such as lumbar puncture, insertion of catheters, and thoracentesis. The student is expected to assume increasing responsibility for hospitalized patients and to develop an ap\u00ad proach to patients' problems which includes references to the appropriate medical literature. Neurosciences. A combined effort of neurology and neuro\u00ad surgery, the clinical neurosciences clerkship emphasizes the development of student skills in neurological examination as well as the medical and surgical management of patients with brain, nerve, and muscle disease. Obstetrics and Gynecology. During this clerkship students are taught the scientific basis of gynecology and obstetrics, including reproductive physiology, anatomy, fetal physiology, and pathology. Practical experience is offered in the manage\u00ad ment of normal an~ abnormal pregnancy and delivery. Instruc\u00ad tion is given in office and surgical gynecology. Students who have completed an introductory clerkship may then apply for an advanced elective that allows a progression of clinical responsibility both in operative obstetrics and office gynecol\u00ad ogy. This advanced period also may be devoted to an in-depth study of a subspecialty area such as gynecologic oncology, maternal-fetal medicine, reproductive endocrinology and infer\u00ad tility, or human sexuality. Ophthalmology. Medical students are instructed in basic techniques of ophthalmologic examination, the principles of ophthalmology, and the common sense evaluation of ophthal\u00ad mic problems. Pediatrics and Human Development. Pediatrics includes instruction in the management and nutrition of normal and sick infants and children; relationships with parents and other family members; normal development of the infant into childhood and adolescence; diagnosis of developmental defects; general UC IRVINE - 1981-1982approaches to treatment and rehabilitation; common infections predominant in infancy and childhood; and peculiarities of the effects of medication in children. Physic:al Medicine and Rehabilitation. During the physical medicine and rehabilitation rotation, students are assigned patients who are in an active rehabilitation program. Emphasis is placed on the rehabilitation of the total patient. The medical aspects of the patient's care are discussed in detail. Instruction is provided in the various physical techniques of rehabilitation and in the psychosocial factors which permanently affect this process. Primary Care. Students attend an assigned primary care clinic one-half day per week for five consecutive quintiles in either family medicine, internal medicine, or pediatrics. Each student becomes the primary care provider for a number of patients in an ambulatory setting and continues as their primary care pro\u00ad vider throughout the clerkship. Under the supervision of pri\u00ad mary care faculty, students gain specific primary care skills. This experience in continuous care should provide a basis for a stu\u00ad dent's selection or rejection of a career in a primary care specialty. Psychiatry. The eight-week clinical clerkship is the culmination of the process of learning human behavior as it relates to general medicine. The student elects two four-week clinical rotations as subinternships, participating fully in patient care, clinical teach\u00ad ing, and conferences. Choices include adult inpatient psychiatry, alcoholism, child psychiatry, consultation psychiatry, and emer\u00ad gency room psychiatry. A wide variety of clinical settings and patient populations is available. Radiology. The role of radiological sciences (both diagnostic and therapeutic) in relation to medicine and surgery is taught to students through exposure to clinical specialists in subspecialty areas such as nuclear medicine, ultrasound, computerized tomog\u00ad raphy, chest, bone, gastrointestinal, etc.; daily clinical film con\u00ad ferences with staff and residents; the American College of Radi\u00ad ology film learning laboratory; and daily seminars interrelating general medicine and radiology. Emphasis is given to the use of ionizing radiation for diagnosis and treatment, understanding the risk/benefit ratios involved, and the clinical indications for various radiological procedures. Surgery. Students study both outpatients (including those in the emergency room) and inpatients. This clerkship emphasizes diagnosis, pathophysiology, and general approaches to the treatment of surgical patients, including the special problems of mass casualties. The student becomes an integral part of the surgical team. Pathology. This is an elective opportunity for the study of ana\u00ad tomical pathology, surgical pathology, clinical laboratory pathology, the subspecialties of pathology, and research in a clinical setting. Interactions among pathology, tumor immunol\u00ad ogy, dermatopathology, cytology, neuropathology, medical juris\u00ad prudence, and forensic pathology are demonstrated. Medical Residency Programs The following residency programs are offered: Anesthesiology Dermatology Family Medicine MEDICINE 253 Medicine, Gas\u00ad troenterology, Hematology/Oncology, Diseases, a'nd Rheumatology Neurology Nuclear Medicine Obstetrics and Gynecology Occupational Medicine (Community and Environmental Medicine) Ophthalmology Pathology Pediatrics, including General Pediatrics, Allergy, Genetics and Developmental Disabilities, Ambulatory and Community Pedi\u00ad atrics, Endocrinology, Neonatology, and Hematology /Oncology Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Psychiatry and Human Behavior, including Adult and Child Psychiatry Radiology, including Diagnostic and Therapeutic Radiology Surgery, including General Surgery, Neurosurgery, Orthopedic Surgery, Otolaryngology, Plastic Surgery, Thoracic Surgery, Urology, and Vascular Surgery All programs meet the formal standards of the American Medi\u00ad cal Association and the appropriate specialty boards. The Uni\u00ad versity of California, Irvine adheres to the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1976, P.L. 94-484, Section 709, regarding shared-schedule residency training positions. Graduate Academic Programs The basic medical science Departments of Anatomy, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology, and Physiology and Biophysics of the College of Medicine participate jointly with the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences in offering graduate instruction leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Biological Sciences. In addition, the Department of Radiological Sciences and the Department of Medical Pharmacology and Therapeutics offer M.S. and Ph.D. programs. Application materials may be obtained by writing the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. A detailed' description of the graduate academic programs by department follows: M.D ... Ph.D. Programs Exceptionally well-qualified students interested in careers in academic medicine may be admitted concurrently to the M.D. program and one of several Ph.D. programs. These students pursue curricula leading to an M.D. degree from the College of Medicine and a Ph.D. degree from the School of Biological UC IRVINE - 1981-1982\\ ZS4 MEDICINE Sciences. (Students presently holding either degree are not eligi\u00ad ble for the program.) Applicants for this program must submit separate applications to both the College of Medicine and the Division of Graduate Studies and Research and should note on both applications that they wish to be considered as M.D. /Ph.D. candidates. The Division of Graduate Studies and Research application must be for admission to a graduate department with an approved Ph.D. program, and applicants should write the department they wish to join for graduate admission requirements. For additional information, write Dr. James Hall, M.D./Ph.D. Coordinator, Department of Physiol\u00ad ogy and Biophysics, College of Medicine, University of Califor\u00ad nia, Irvine; Irvine, California 92 71 7: Anatomy The Department of Anatomy in the College of Medicine offers a doctoral program leading to the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, with specialized research training in the neurosciences. Research programs in the neurosciences include neurotransmit\u00ad ter immunocytochemistry, the central neural regulation of circa\u00ad dian rhythms, forebrain organization, and organization and development of sensory systems. Research programs also include growth inhibition, cartilage, and pulmonary edema. The Department maintains research facilities so that the student can become experienced with the following neuroscientific data. Stu\u00ad dents are encouraged to become proficient in multiple areas of study using numerous techniques in various species. Students in the Department of Anatomy have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the technical skills, theoretical back\u00ad ground, and experimental knowledge necessary to conduct innovative and fundamentally sound research. The second goal is to become knowledgeable anatomists with the ability to teach graduate, undergraduate, and professional courses in anatomy and neuroscience. These two goals are achieved through a basic and extended academic program that is tailored to the individ\u00ad ual needs of the student. The core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of gross, cellular, and subcellular anat\u00ad omy; physiology; and biochemistry. In the first year, students will be required to take neuroanatomy, microscopic anatomy, embryology, gross anatomy, biochemistry, and physiology. Over the usual four-year training period the student will be required to complete a practical course in statistics, four departmental seminar courses, four laboratory tutorials, and a total of 50 credit hours of research in anatomy. Elective courses.in the Department of Anatomy or other departments on campus may also be taken; examples include pharmacology, psychobiology, cell biology, genetics, computer science, pathology, and physiol\u00ad ogy. The student typically devoteS the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to tak\u00ad ing electives. Only a minimum of the third year is spent taking courses. Each year following the first year, the student is expected to act as an assistant in one major anatomy core course. When a student is accepted into the graduate program, the stu\u00ad dent and the Graduate Committee deeide to which laboratories the student will be assigned the first year. During the first year the student will spend approximately 25 percent of the time doing research. At the beginning of the second year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the dissertation research. An oral Qualifying Examina\u00ad tion at the end of the summer of the second year is given to the student by a Candidacy Committee. The examination covers anatomy and focuses on the candidate's field of specialization. The dissertation research is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Graduate Committee. The major\u00ad ity of the second, third, and fourth year is devoted to complet\u00ad ing the research and preparing a written dissertation suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the student's advisor and Doctoral Committee constitutes the final examina\u00ad tion. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded follow\u00ad ing completion of all the requirements, a process that normally will take four years to complete. Biological Chemistry The Department of Biological Chemistry in the College of Med\u00ad icine and the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemis\u00ad try in the School of Biological Sciences jointly offer graduate study leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences under the administration of the School of Biological Sciences. The pro\u00ad gram makes extensive use of health sciences facilities, in addi\u00ad tion to those of the School of Biological Sciences. The curricu\u00ad lum is designed to produce creative and productive scientists who have an in-depth comprehension of modern biochemistry and molecular biology and who are highly competent in a given subspecialty. The faculty's research interests include structure and synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, regulation, metabo\u00ad lism, biochemical genetics, gene organization, and immunology. The first-year student is required to take a core of advanced courses (204, 205A-B, and 207), to become associated with the laboratories of at least three different investigators, and to attend the 201A-B-C seminar series. Upon successful comple\u00ad tion of the first year, the student is given a comprehensive oral examination to test breadth and depth of knowledge. Although further supplemental work may be recommended, the student normally begins a specific research project with a faculty member in the second year. By passing an oral examination at the beginning of the third year on the proposed thesis work, the student may advance to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Stu\u00ad dents normally complete their degree programs after a total of four years of graduate study. Participation in the seminar series (201A-B-C) and completion of at least one satellite course per year (210-279) are expected of all continuing students. Regular teaching of undergraduates is part of the training of graduate students at all levels. The graduate committee may waive some of the above requirements for candidates for the Master's degree. Applicants should have adequate undergraduate preparation in calculus, physics, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. Students who have not had an adequate physical chemistry course are expected to take Chemistry 130A-B-C during their first year. UC IRVINE - 1981-1982See page 84 for information on faculty research areas and course descriptions. Microbiology Graduate instruction and research in microbiology leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences are offered by the Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine. The curriculum of the Department is designed to provide advanced training to indi~ viduals interested in the molecular basis of regulatory systems which operate in viruses, microorganisms, and cultured mam\u00ad malian cells; and in the structure, genetics, and synthesis of immunoglobulins. The core curriculum is centered about the molecular biology and genetics of viruses and bacteria, the fun\u00ad damentals of the immune response, the biology of cultured animal cells, and the genetics and physiology of infectious agents. It is recommended that the student's undergraduate preparation include courses in calculus, physical chemistry, and biochemis\u00ad try. Before a graduate degree will be awarded, the student must demonstrate competence, by courSe work and examination, in biochemistry, physical chemistry, genetics, and various aspects of microbiology and immunology. During the first year, all stu\u00ad dents in the graduate program will be expected to spend approx\u00ad imately six weeks in various faculty members' laboratories with the aim of becoming familiar with the research approaches and the laboratory techniques employed in each specific research area. Incoming students review their programs each quarter with the departmental graduate student advisor. During the second or third year, each student will take an advancement-to~ndi\u00ad dacy examination. Graduate students are required to take grad\u00ad uate courses in biochemistry, and Microbiology 210, 212, 213, 214, and 280. Additional course work will reflect the interest of the individual student. The major remaining requirement for the Ph.D. degree will be the satisfactory completion and oral defense of a dissertation consisting of original research carried out under the guidance of a faculty member. Students with ade\u00ad quate preparation should be able to complete the Ph.D. in four years or less. See page 89 for information on faculty research areas and course descriptions. \u00b7 Pharmacology and Toxicology The Department of Medical Pharmacology and Therapeutics offers graduate study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. in Pharma\u00ad cology and Toxicology.

Physiology and Biophysics Graduate instruction and research in physiology and biophysics leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences is offered by the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, College of Medicine. The Department provides research opportunities in the molecu\u00ad lar biophysics of membranes and proteins; endocrinology; cellu\u00ad lar physiology; and the physiology of exercise, respiration, and the nervous system. The faculty research is generally oriented toward molecular and cellular physiology, but opportunities for research in organ physiology also exist. The curriculum pro\u00ad vides the student with a broad background in physiology and biophysics and the closely related fields of anatomy and bio\u00b7 chemistry. Elective courses permit in-depth exploration of par\u00ad ticular areas. Interdisciplinary dissertation research involving the research of more than one faculty member is encouraged. Prerequisites for admission normally include a bachelor's degree in one of the biological sciences, physics, chemistry, mathemat\u00ad ics, or engineering, as well as undergraduate courses in calculus, organic and physical chemistry, biochemistry, and advanced biology (e.g., neurophysiology, cell biology, neurobiology, psy\u00ad chobiology). Up to two prerequisites may be fulfilled as first\u00ad year electives. ORE Aptitude Test scores are required. Prefer\u00ad ence will be given to those students who have prior research experience. The Department admits about three highly qualified students each fall. The program emphasizes original research, and stu\u00ad dents are expected to become involved in the research of the Department as early as possible. The core program includes graduate courses in physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, mor\u00ad phology, and cell biology. After the first year, training will fol\u00ad low the classical tutorial pattern in which a small number of students are tutored by the faculty in an informal setting. Stu\u00ad dents also will participate in a program of laboratory rotations and attend the weekly colloquium in physiology. The third and fourth years will be spent primarily in research, with some par\u00ad ticipation in teaching physiology to medical students. Each stu-dent must submit a written dissertation on an original research project and successfully defend this dissertation in an oral examination. Incoming students will receive academic advising from the Department Graduate Advisor until such time as they choose a thesis advisor .. The faculty conducts quarterly reviews of all continuing students to ensure that they are maintaining satisfac\u00ad tory progress within their particular academic program. Stu\u00ad dents who have completed all necessary prerequisites should be able to complete the Ph.D. within four years. A comprehensive examination will be administered in June at the end of the second year. The examination is based upon the tutorials in advanced physiology and is designed to test the stu\u00ad dent's ability to organize a body of knowledge and to think crit\u00ad ically. Some time during the third year, the student will present a seminar on a topic assigned by the formal candidacy commit\u00ad tee. Following the seminar, the committee will critically examine the stUdent's qualifications for the successful conduct of the doctoral dissertation. Advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. is recommended to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon the unanimous vote of the committee. For information on faculty research areas and course descrip\u00ad tions, see page 90. Some faculty from the Department are members of an interdis\u00ad ciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group; see page 75 for a description of the program. Radiological Sciences The Department of Radiological Sciences offers graduate pro\u00ad grams of advanced study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. Both programs are oriented toward the eq,ucation and training of the superior student who has the potential and desire to become a creative and productive member of the medical or medical-related communities. A broad-based, interdisciplinary curriculum places heavy emphasis on research and is designed to provide the student with a comprehensive knowledge of the field in addition to an exceptionally high level of competence in one or more subspe\u00ad cialties. By utilizing the training received in medical imaging, medical physics, bioengineering, radiobiology, and radiological engineering, the student should be prepared for a wide range of career opportunities in university, hospital, or industrial settings upon completion of this program. Prospective students are cau\u00ad tioned that the program is extremely demanding and requires a broad base of knowledge in a variety of the conventional disciplines. The Department of Radiological Sciences has well-equipped radiodiagnostic, radiobiological, engineering, and medical phys\u00ad ics laboratories located on campus and at the hospitals asso\u00ad ciated with the University of California, Irvine. Major research areas include the general aspects of medical imaging and basic and applied studies dealing with radiodiagnosis, nuclear medi\u00ad cine, computerized tomography, medical ultrasonics, radiother\u00ad apy, and radiobiology. The core program plus additional courses as may be required by the Graduate Committee normally will require two years to \" UC IRVINE - 1981-1982complete. To receive either the M.S. or Ph.D. degree, the stu\u00ad dent must successfully complete the core courses or their equivalents. Requirements for the M.S. degree may be satisfied in one of two ways. Under Plan I, the student completes the Radiological Sciences core program with an average grade of B or above and under the direction of a faculty advisor also prepares a thesis that is acceptable to the thesis committee. Under Plan II, the student completes the core program plus a minimum of eight additional credits (all with an average grade of B or above) in a given area of specialization and satisfactorily passes a compre\u00ad hensive written examination. Requirements for the Ph.D. degree may be divided into four stages. First, the student must complete the core program and take additional course work as recommended by the Graduate Committee, all with an average grade of B or above. Second, the student must pass a written and oral qualifying examination given at the end of the second full year of study. A student who fails the preliminary qualifying examination can, with approval from the Graduate Committee, repeat the examination the fol\u00ad lowing year. Third, within a year after passing the preliminary examination, the student must pass the final oral qualifying examination covering the proposed field of research and be advanced to candidacy. Finally, a dissertation representing origi\u00ad nal research in the student's principal field of study must be prepared and defended. The dissertation, conducted under the direction of the doctoral committee, represents the major ele\u00ad ment in the doctoral program; it must be a significant contribu\u00ad tion to the field and is expected to demonstrate critical judg\u00ad ment, intellectual synthesis, and imaginative creativity. During the final quarter of graduate study the student is required to defend the dissertation in an oral examination conducted by the doctoral committee. Admission to the graduate program is by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon recommendation of the Department and is based upon letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, previous scholarship, and other qualifica\u00ad tions. Applicants should have a broad undergraduate back\u00ad ground in both the physical and the biological sciences. Since most students will need some additional work in one or more disciplines, the graduate program allows for the correction of minor deficiencies during the first year, as determined by departmental review. Although the program is rigorous, it is also sufficiently flexible to allow for a wide range of interests and objectives. Application deadline for the fall quarter is June 1 of each year. However, to receive full consideration for financial assistance, fall quarter applications should be completed by February 1. Applications for the winter and spring quarters will be accepted only under special circumstances.

Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Dis\u00ad closure of Information from Student Records, students at the Univer\u00ad sity have the following five rights: UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS/SIUDENT RECORDS 261 I. to inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capacity as students; 2. tQ inspect records maintained by the campus of disclosure of per\u00ad sonally identifiable information from their student records; 3. to seek correction of their student records through a request to amend the records or a request for a hearing; 4. to file complaints with the Deparrment of Health and Human Ser\u00ad vices regarding alleged violations of the rights accorded them by the Act; and 5. to have withheld from disclosure, in the absence of their prior con\u00ad sent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. Student Records Types and locations of major student records maintained by the cam\u00ad pus are listed in the following table; consult the Campus Directory or building directories for room numbers.

Universiry officials may require access to student records in the course of the performance of their assigned duties. Further, (a) in connection with conditions of certain financial aid awards; (b) when the campus is complying with a judicial order or sub\u00ad poena; and (c) when authorized federal or state officials are conducting an audit or eooluation of federally supported educational programs, con\u00ad fidential information can be disclosed without prior written consent of the student. There are also other situations in which the Universiry is required to disclose information. See Policies Applying to Campus Activi\u00ad ties, Organizations, and Students, Part B, Section 10.721 for a list of exceptions. Normally, the campus will release the following as personally identifi\u00ad able information which can be made public: Student's name; Address (campus, local, and/or permanent) and telephone numbers; Date and place of birth; Major field of study, dates of attendance, degrees and honors received; Most recent previous educational institution attended; Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercollegiate athletics; Name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate University athletic teams. However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these categories to be designated public information 'with respect to them\u00ad selves. (See the NOTE above.) If a student requested that information from his or her records not be regarded as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implications of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from dis\u00ad closure a student's name and degrees and honors received, the campus cannot release for publication information on any honors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student's name and degree earned in the campus commencement pro\u00ad gram without the written consent of the student. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and dates of attendance, a student's status as a student cannot be verified for poten\u00ad tial employers without the written consent of the student. Further, if a student's last instruction to the campus was to withhold from dis\u00ad closure the degree granted to that student and the date on which the degree was conferred, that information cannot be ~onfirmed for a third party in connection with the appointment of that graduate to a new position or in connection with an honor that individual received with\u00ad out the written consent of the student. Students wishing to restrict release of public information should con\u00ad tact the Registrar's Office for instructions on how to do so. Questions regarding the rights of students under the University policies and the federal law should be directed to the Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs or that person's designate, 260 Administration. A Personal Data Sheet is included in each quarter's registration packet which allows students to examine and update their personal data. Furthermore, during the eighth week of classes, every student is pro\u00ad vided with a record of current term enrollment as part of his or her registration materials for the next quarter to ensure the accuracy of official enrollment. Students are urged to report officially to the Regis\u00ad trar's Office all changes in personal data and enrollment data. It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office currently informed as changes occur to assure that accurate and com\u00ad plete records are maintained. Students are informed annually of their rights under the University's student records policies and the federal Act. Copies of the Act and University and campus policies are available for review in the Refer\u00ad ence Room, Main Library. In addition, University policies are pub\u00ad lished in the booklet Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organiza\u00ad tions, and Students-Part B, copies of which are available in Campus Organization Services. Complaints regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded students by the federal Act may be filed with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office (FERPA), Department of Education, 4511 Switzer Building, Washington, D.C. 20202.
