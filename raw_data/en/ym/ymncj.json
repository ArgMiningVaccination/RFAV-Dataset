That's where the breath comes in. The body is connected to the mind and spirit through breath by mindfully concentrating on the breath. In a ](https://swiha.edu/all-programs/) [study](http://www.news.wisc.edu/releases/18748) conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, researchers claim to have found the measurement of mindfulness through breath counting. However, the lead researcher said, \"Counting isn't the main focus; it's the experiential awareness of breath.\" In other words, the breath has the ability to take us to a special place, a place deep within the mind and body to reach that spiritual connection. Spirit is within the breath, not without the breath. Everyone and everything is made of energy, just vibrating at different frequencies. That energy may be moved and shifted with the breath to clear blockages, remove stagnant air, and open one up to new life. The practice of mindful breathing keeps the energy flowing and moving within the body, mind, and spirit. The more we practice connecting with the breath, the stronger the connection becomes between the mind, body, and spirit. This pathway through mindful breathing allows us to connect to our inner knowing for positive transformation and healing. [Think about it this way. Breath is essential to life. What is the first thing we did when we came out of the womb? We gasped for air and took a breath. We did this so that we could clear our lungs and take in life. We did that with our breath. Used intentionally and mindfully, we can harness the power of breathing. The simple power of being mindful of the breath can take a person from feeling down and exhausted to feeling energized, self-aware, and ready to go.](https://swiha.edu/mind-body-transformational-psychology/) Here are 5 easy steps to start connecting the mind, body, and spirit through the breath. - Set an intention to connect the mind, body, and spirit through the breath. - Begin by completely exhaling and pushing out as much air as you can, pulling the belly toward the spine. - Next, inhale to at least a count of four: in through the nose and down into the belly, noticing your belly expand as you do this. Then continue inhaling to fill the lungs, and finally to fill the throat. - Pause for a second or two. - Slowly exhale through the nose to at least a count of four, watch the belly fall, and pull the belly in towards the spine as you exhale completely. Start back at step one, and repeat. [When this process is repeated over and over, we have a larger capacity to breathe. When we have a larger capacity to breathe, we have the opportunity to move into parts of our bodies and our lives that we were not able to reach before. With this larger capacity to breathe, we have a larger capacity to take in life. With breath, we have life. With life, we have power. With power, we can do extraordinary things.](https://swiha.edu/mind-body-transformational-psychology/) The Southwest Institute of Healing Arts offers quite a few classes that discuss the importance of breathing.
