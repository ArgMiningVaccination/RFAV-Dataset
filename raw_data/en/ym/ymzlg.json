Food may splatter and cross-contaminate. Store foods individually wrapped and sealed. Store nuts separately from other food and buy only what you need. Use specific color -designated knives and cutting boards for each allergenic food. Properly sanitize dishes to avoid contamination and designate specific dishes to be used only by the food-allergic person. Clean equipment thoroughly - all pots and pans should be cleaned, dried and stored properly. Clean kitchen surfaces - don't forget front edges of countertops and drawer handles/knobs.
