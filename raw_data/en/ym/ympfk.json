Studies usually focus on perceptions of parents and have largely neglected the group of health care providers. However, doctors' notions on vaccination have a major impact on the decision-making process of their patients. We were interested tounderstand the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy among physicians, with a particular focus on the measles vaccine. Furthermore, we aimed to understand the underlying perceptions of measles that may be associated with vaccine hesitant decisions. Methods: In order to get an in-depth view, semi-structured interviews with physicians were conducted. Doctors were eligible for the study if they articulated vaccine hesitant views and/or demonstrated vaccine hesitancy in their medical practice. Results: We interviewed 12 physicians, of whom 11 had a medical practice with no contract with the Austrian social insurance ('Wahlarzt') and additional training in complementary and alternative medicine. We found perceptions of immunology, health and illness that were discordant with evidence-based medicine and closely related to alternative and complementary medicine. All participants argued for a delayed administration of the measles vaccine. We found a consistent inclination to- wards 'individual vaccination', which was explained as empowering parents and to strengthen their decision-making competencies. Most participants expressed doubts about the reliability of vaccine studies and were con- cerned with possible long-term effects. Conclusions: Paying closer attention to doctors' concerns on vaccination might help to design target-oriented interventions to specifically strengthen vaccine confidence. ...................... ...................... ...................... ...................... ................. Introduction In 2019, global measles cases reached an all-time high of the last quarter-century. Between 2016 and 2019, global annual case numbers climbed up from 132 325 to 869 770. Austria reported77 cases in 2018 and 151 cases in 2019, hence, it ranks in themidrange of the EU. 1-3M e a s l e si sah i g h l yc o n t a g i o u sv i r a ld i s - ease. Stable vaccination coverage rates of /C2195% with two doses of a measles containing vaccine (MCV ) are therefore crucial, as only a slight reduction in coverage would result in multiple timesincreased case numbers. 4,5Vaccine hesitancy (VH), defined by the SAGE working group as 'delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccine services',6is of growing scientific interest and has the potential to undermine measlesimmunization rates. 7The term VH comprises a broad spectrum of attitudes and beliefs, associat ed with different vaccination be- haviour and increased request for alternative vaccination schedules.8Research on VH has mainly focussed on parents.9,10Among them, key elements of VH include risk conceptualization (e.g. the weight-ing of the perceived risk of a vaccine vs. the disease), alternative health beliefs (e.g. 'the vaccine is not natural' and 'children's bodies are overcharged by vaccines'), philosophical considerations onparents' responsibility (e.g. parents want to take self-determinedhealth decisions for their children and they do not want to be pushed towards a certain decision) and distrust towards the pharmaceutical industry, public health authorities and health pro-viders (e.g. these institutions only have financial interests and healthproviders are influenced by them). 10,11 There is no data available on the quantity of VH among Austrian doctors. Studies from other European countries, however, showed that the vast majority of medical doctors is favourable towards vac-cination, and that there is a small percentage who is sceptical. 12-15 The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is regarded as a possible factor for VH.16,17According to Bean et al.18common beliefs among CAM practicing doctors included'I'm not an anti-vaxer!'\u2014vaccine hesitancy among physicians 1157Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/31/6/1157/6377220 by guest on 01 June 2022 that 'the body is able to defend and heal itself', 'disease is an ex- pression of poor personal management' and 'the children's immune system is too weak to bear a vaccine'. Deml et al.19found that the basis of VH among CAM practicing doctors is the firm desire toacknowledge each person's individuality and the will to empowerparents to make self-determined decisions. The Austrian social insurance is based on the principle of soli- darity. Everyone covered by social insurance (in 2017 99.9% of allinhabitants 20) has access to good quality medical care. Doctors who have a contract with the social insurance ('Kassenarzt') settlethe costs directly with them and patients do not have to pay. Doctors who do not have a contract with the social insurance are called 'Wahlarzt'. Patients have to pay these services and getit partly refunded by the social insurance. In contrast to a'Kassenarzt', a 'Wahlarzt' is able to decide freely on opening hours, t h ea m o u n to fp a t i e n t sa sw e l la st h ep r o v i d e ds e r v i c e sa n di t s costs. 21,22 According to Kemppainen et al.23around 36% of the Austrian population used at least one type of CAM in a period of 1 year. Thiswas the third highest percentage found in the EU (after Switzerland and Germany). The Austrian public health insurance does not re- fund CAM products or interventions. 24 Vaccination is not mandatory in Austria. Thus, it is essential that health care providers have an affirmative notion concerning vaccin-ation, since their opinions have a strong influence on patients. 25,26 An in-depth understanding of VH among doctors is crucial in order to implement target-oriented interventions to counter this growingchallenge. It was therefore the aim of this study to investigate beliefsand characteristics of vaccine hesitant doctors concerning (i) vac-cination in generally, (ii) specifically the measles vaccine and (iii) their perceptions on measles. Methods Participants were eligible for the study if they (i) practiced as general practitioners (GPs) or paediatricians (Ps), (ii) were by definition 'vaccine hesitant' and (iii) provided vaccination information or ad- vice, and/or vaccination services. We anticipated that it would be challenging to approach vaccine hesitant doctors, as they are considered a minority (e.g.Reference 15) Furthermore, VH is broadly debated in Austria 27 and several anti-vaccine doctors who articulated their beliefs in pub- lic recently lost their licence as physicians (e.g. Reference 28). Three different sampling approaches were applied:29(i) F.E. enquired the contact details of two vaccine hesitant doctors through personalcontacts (convenience sampling). (ii) Doctors who appeared to be vaccine hesitant judging from their web-page-content were approached (purposeful sampling). (iii) Through recommendationsof previous participants, we were able to contact further potentialparticipants (snowball sampling). Physicians were contacted via tele- phone to explore whether the inclusion criteria were met. In total, we contacted 20 doctors. Three doctors never reacted to the inter-view request and five doctors refused to participate in the study. Participants were asked to indicate demographic data, such as age, sex, specialization (general medicine or paediatrics; additional train- ing in CAM) and type of practice ('Kassenarzt' or 'Wahlarzt'). An interview guide with open-ended questions was prepared that main-ly covered the following topics: perceptions on measles (risks, com-plications, treatment and experience), opinion on vaccination (earlychildhood vaccination and polyvalent vaccines) and especially on the MCV (timing, side effects and necessity). Data collection and analysis were performed after the participants' informed consentwas obtained. The interviews were held in German, lasted between40 and 150 min and were conducted in the doctors' practices. During the process of verbatim transcription, interview data were anonymized by using one of the 12 most frequent last names inAustria as a pseudonym. In qualitative research, the interpretationof data are not considered independent from sampling and furthersampling takes place after the interpretation of earlier data. 29,30We conducted an inductive content analysis, applying techniques of grounded theory:29,31(i) open coding in order to reflect the text and identify categories; (ii) axial coding, in which the codes arebroken down, modified and compared until relationships and var-iations are understood; and (iii) selective coding to determine core categories. During the research process analytic memos were made whenever new insights were gained. The coding was conducted withatlas.ti (version 8.4.20.0). 32As is typical for qualitative research,29,33 the sample size was not determined in advance but continued until theoretical saturation was reached, which depended on the inform- ative value and variety of participants. Theoretical saturation is reached when no new or relevant information emerges from add-itional interviews. To ensure quality and credibility of data, authors met on a regular basis in order to discuss the findings and to reach consensus. Furthermore, all analytic decisions were documented in detail toensure consensus. Results Between May 2019 and January 2020, we conducted 12 semi- structured interviews with 6 female and 6 male participants aged between 42 and 73 years. Seven participants were GPs and five werePs. Eleven doctors worked as 'Wahlarzt' and had further training inCAM, eight practiced homeopathy (HP). Only one doctor was a'Kassenarzt' and did not have further training in CAM ( Table 1 ). In the following sections, we will firstly describe the participants' perception on childhood diseases in general and on measles specif-ically, and on vaccination. Secondly, we will present their particular Table 1 Demographic data Pseudonym Gender Age Specialization CAM-type Type of practice Dr Wagner $ 71 GP Homeopathy Wahlarzt Dr Gruber # 64 Paediatrician Homeopathy Wahlarzt Dr Winkler # 52 GP Homeopathy Wahlarzt Dr Weber # 65 GP Other Wahlarzt Dr Huber $ 46 Paediatrician Homeopathy Wahlarzt Dr Bauer $ 42 Paediatrician Anthroposophic medicine Wahlarzt Dr Wimmer $ 51 GP Homeopathy Wahlarzt Dr Mu \u00a8 ller # 73 Paediatrician Anthroposophic medicine Wahlarzt Dr Wallner # 59 GP \u2014 Kassenarzt Dr Wolf $ 43 Paediatrician Homeopathy Wahlarzt Dr Stein # 42 GP Homeopathy Wahlarzt Dr Pichler $ 57 GP Homeopathy Wahlarzt Participants' demographic data characterized by pseudonym, gender, age, specialization, CAM-type and type of practice (private or panel).

Thirdly, we will explain the participants' preference for selective vaccination and its impli- cations. Finally, we will describe issues of trust towards the medicalsystem ( Table 2 ). Perception on childhood diseases, measles and vaccination Several participants did not find it necessary to prevent measles. Dr Gruber [ #, 64 years, paediatrician (P), homeopathy (HP)] is a case in point by explaining that, 'measles is definitely manageable, if apatient is infected at a certain age'. This 'preferable age' of being infected with measles (i.e. because of 'low rates of complications') lies, according to some participants, between 1.5 and 9 years. It wasoften highlighted that in their own childhood measles was an or-dinary childhood disease, thus, they did not necessarily see the need for preventing it. Some participants reported memories of their own measles infection, in which relational aspects were highlighted. Thedisease was described as an 'intensive time', closely spent with afamily member. In this context, some participants criticized modernfamily structures and gender roles and they blamed vaccination for being a tool to compensate a lack of care for children. Dr Gruber continued: 'Families are not equipped anymore to care for a highlyfebrile patient for two or three weeks. Mother is working, father aswell and grandmother is at the golf course. That's how it is. [ ...]I f families have a great structure and the grandmother is available for the child, it's okay. Why shouldn't this child get measles?'. It was assumed that most measles complications could be avoided if handled in the appropriate way. Participants believed that measlespatients were often hospitalized due to a lack of confidence andexperience among young doctors, which in turn created a wrongimage of measles. It was emphasized that it was crucial to never reduce fever by pharmaceutical means and to order strict bed rest. In addition, CAM treatments or measures were frequently broughtup (e.g. HP, enemas and dietetic measures). Dr Mu \u00a8ller ( #, 73 years, P, anthroposophic medicine), who had a very figurative notion ofhealth and illness, explained that 'measles is a highly febrile illness and it's very important that children learn in advance, in terms of other febrile infections, how to deal with fever'. Some participants pointed out that childhood diseases do have beneficial aspects, e.g. for the immune system or the neurologic development of the child, others viewed it as a 'natural milestone' in a child's development. Subsequently, Dr Mu \u00a8ller continued that a childhood disease is 'the first thing a child can do on its own' andtherefore 'represents the independent will of a child'. Dr Wagner ( $; 71 years, GP, HP) who refused all vaccines claimed that childhood diseases are 'cleaning up the body' and are there 'to get rid of her- editary things'. It was a common belief that one should not interfere with nature, as every illness had its purpose and should therefore not be 'sup-pressed' by a vaccine. Several participants assumed that the eradi- cation of diseases is neither constructive, nor possible. For example, Dr Pichler ( $, 57 years, GP, HP) reckoned that 'if you eradicate a disease, another will appear' and that this phenomenon is 'obviouslya principle of nature'. It was commonly expressed that unvaccinated persons are overall healthier than vaccinated ones. Dr Wagner was sure that there is a 'difference in the development' and she experienced that 'vaccinatedchildren get chronic diseases, while unvaccinated children enjoytheir healthy life'. According to some participants, especially vaccin-ation at an early age has the potential to interfere with the natural development of (i) the immune system and (ii) the neurologicTable 2 Main findings Perception of measles and other childhood diseases 'Measles is a manageable childhood disease''Measles and its risks are often depicted in an exaggerated way' 'Childhood diseases have positive aspects' 'Childhood diseases can be accompanied with CAM measures''Childhood diseases should not be suppressed'Perception of vaccination a young organism' 'Vaccination at a young age should be avoided' Approaches concerning the measles vaccine'Vaccines are better tolerated when a child is older' !Delay of the MCV, but before kindergarten 'Vaccines are more effective when a child is older' 'Measles implicates a high risk' 'Measles infection has positive aspects' !Delay of the MCV until puberty or rejection of the MCV 'Measles infection is manageable' 'MCV implicates a high considered' Individual vaccination 'Every child is different'; decisions only at an individual level; vaccination is an option 'Parents should make self determined decisions' (gathering information \u00feintuitive decision) 'Individual vaccination is not for everybody' (high effort and costs)'Vaccination is for lower socioeconomic classes' Mistrust against public health authorities and pharmaceutical companies 'Studies often have a conflict of interest''Long-term effects, soft side effects and interactions are not sufficiently investigated''Public vaccination schedules are not evidence-based' Criticism of the medical system 'Patients want to see a \"Wahlarzt\", as they were disappointed by a \"Kassenarzt\"''A \"Kassenarzt\" does not have time and resources for information seeking parents/patients' Summary of the main findings structured in six sections: (i) perception of measles and other childhood diseases; (ii) perception of vaccin- ation; (iii) approaches concerning the measles containing vaccine; (iv) individual vaccination; (v) mistrust against public health authorities and pharmaceutical companies; and (vi) criticism of the medical system.'I'm not an anti-vaxer!'\u2014vaccine hesitancy among physicians 1159Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/31/6/1157/6377220 by guest on 01 June 2022 system. Consequently, vaccination would lead to (i) allergies and autoimmune diseases and (ii) to neurologic disorders (e.g. behav- iour change, language deficits, loss of trust and happiness). DrWinkler ( #, 52 years, GP, HP) speaks for the majority of participants when he stated: 'Vaccines are better tolerated when a child is older!The amount of vaccines infants receive is insane. I believe that these are too many toxins for a small organism'. In line with Dr Winkler, most participants were concerned with polyvalent vaccines, whichwould 'overcharge the young organism', whereas Dr Wimmer ( $, 51 years, GP, HP) brought up: 'I sometimes think if I wait sometime, I tend to prefer combined vaccines, [ ...] as the more single vaccines are used, the more additives are injected'. Particular notions on the measles vaccine No participant complied with the guidelines of the Austrian vaccin-ation schedule regarding the MCV. Dr Wallner ( #, 59 years, GP, no CAM-training, 'Kassenarzt') was the only participant who indicatedthat a specified age for the MCV was necessary (in his opinionMCV1 with 14 months, MCV2 4 months later) and who consideredit highly necessary to prevent measles in any case. Concerning the measles vaccination strategy of the other 11 par- ticipants, 3 main approaches emerged: (i) delayed administration ofthe MCV, but before kindergarten entry, (ii) a delay of the MCVuntil puberty (the time when the risk of complications increase) or(iii) complete rejection of the MCV. Supporters of the first approach aimed to protect children from getting measles, but preferred the delay of the vaccine due to a supposed enhancement of immuneresponse and a decrease in side effects. Supporters of the second andthird approach pursued the target of acquiring the infection due toperceived benefits of the disease. Dr Huber ( $, 46 years, P, HP) was 'not convinced that the shots should be given at nine months', as studies would indicate that 'the earlier children get vaccinated, theless antibody levels rise'. In the same manner, several participantscriticized that early vaccination would lead to weak immunity levels among the whole population and therefore to an impaired transfer- ral of maternal antibodies to newborns. This would result indecreased nest protection of infants and to an increased susceptibil-ity of adults, who lose their initially weak protection. Dr Bauer ( $, 42 years, P, anthroposophic medicine) who shared this view explained that for that reason she was 'not sure if it was a right public health decision to introduce the measles vaccine' .Dr Wolf ( $, 43 years, P, HP) also applied this approach to her own children:'Well, I just took the chances and let as much time as possiblepass by to give them the chance to develop a natural immunity by catching their diseases. And if they do not catch a disease till ado- lescence, I vaccinate them'. Some participants condoned great effort and costs for their patients by ordering monovalent measles vaccines from other coun-tries, as they are not available in Austria. These interviewees usually argued that there is a lack of necessity to vaccinate girls against mumps and boys against rubella. Even though participants named minor and even severe side effects of the MCV, they were not considered as major cause for their doubts. However, participants often expressed a perceived lack of studies investigating the safety of vaccines (see chapter Criticismon biomedicine and the current medical system). Individual vaccination\u2014rejecting the 'one size fits all' model Eight participants had an ambivalent point of view towards vaccin- ation and repeatedly used the expression 'individual vaccination'. Dr Stein ( #, 42 years, GP, HP) emphasized: 'I am not an anti-vaxer, I am a supporter of individual vaccination!', while Dr Wolf ( $, 44 years, P, HP) proposed to use vaccines in the same selective man-ner as antibiotics and stated: 'I do not call vaccines bad or good.Similarly to antibiotics, I only use it if it's necessary'. Anotherfrequently addressed aspect that influenced the decision for or against a vaccine was the socioeconomic background of a family, which is exemplified by Dr Weber's ( #, 65 years, GP, other CAM specialization) statement: 'My opinion is that vaccination is an op-tion, which is definitely beneficial for certain social classes, but notnecessarily for everybody. [ ...] Not vaccination for everybody, but vaccination for risk groups!' Furthermore, participants raised the dilemma that healthy and stable children tolerate vaccines, but donot need it, whereas weak children could neither manage the disease,nor the vaccine. Participants indicated to support self-determined decision of parents concerning the selection of vaccines for their children. This approach included two main aspects: (i) the support of the parents'information seeking process and (ii) the encouragement of theparents' personal intuition and feeling towards vaccines, which was considered as important tool to choose the vaccines or to decide against vaccination. For that reason, 'neutral' or 'objective' informa-tion was provided by the doctors, book or web-page recommenda-tions were given and intensive discussions were held. Consequently,'individual vaccination' was described as an active involvement in the child's health, contrary to the passive way of using the offered public vaccination schedule. Hence, the interviewed doctors frequentlyrepeated that no recommendations on the vaccination procedurewere given, as they did not want to influence or push parents towardsa certain decision. Dr Wolf ( $, 44 years, P, HP) explained: 'Individual consideration is as important as herd immunity. My choice for an infection is at least well-considered'. Some participants highlighted that 'individual vaccination' is not the adequate approach for everyone. Dr Pichler ( $, 57 years, GP, HP) stated that 'the Austrian vaccination plan is completely reason- able and should be followed by the biggest part of the population'. She concluded that 'individual vaccination is only possible for edu-cated people who reflect about the topic and actively decide to spendmoney to consult a \"Wahlarzt\"'. Similarly, Dr Wolf explained, 'It is definitely a two-class medical system, which is determined whether someone has time and money to visit a 'Wahlarzt'. [ ...] But I think a lot of people do not want or need vaccination advice anyway', andshe concluded that these persons should stick to the vaccinationschedule. Criticism of biomedicine and the current medical system All participants distrusted forma l medical science, classical bio- medicine, public health authorities and the pharmaceutical indus-try. It was pointed out that vaccine studies had several deficits,predominantly the insufficient investigation of interactions be-tween vaccines, long-term side effects and 'soft side effects' (e.g. loss of trust and happiness, slight ly increased susceptibility for other infections). Most participants assumed that the pharmaceut-ical industry influences public health decisions concerning vaccin-ation and that these decisions are often not evidence based. For example, Dr Stein ( #, 42 years, GP, HP) was sure that the Austrian vaccination schedule was not evidence based and emphasized:'Vaccination is a highly dogmatic topic among the scientific com-munity and this is something that is insanely difficult to breakdown with evidence'. Participants criticized biomedically oriented 'Kassena \u00a8rzte' and indicated that parents increasingly demanded the help of'Wahla \u00a8rzte' and especially of those who practice CAM, as classical doctors (i) have limited time, (ii) send patients away who ask criticalquestions, (iii) reject patients who report side effects, (iv) dismiss patients, if they do not accept the vaccination schedule or (v) do not know how to treat side effects of vaccines. In this context, theparticipants reported several narratives, e.g. 'During a mother-child examination, the doctor came with the shot and without say-ing anything he vaccinated the child. The mother didn't want that!1160 European Journal of Public HealthDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/31/6/1157/6377220 by guest on 01 June 2022 Well, I can understand that!' (Dr Wallner, #, 59 years, GP, no CAM- specialization, 'Kassenarzt'). Discussion This is the first qualitative study investigating beliefs and opinions among vaccine hesitant doctors in Austria. We could show a relationbetween CAM and VH as well as between VH and elitism. We de- scribe the notion of 'individual vaccination' and the accompanying preference to encourage intuition-based self-determined vaccinationdecisions among parents. Participants largely distrusted the medicalsystem and questioned the role of evidence-based medicine. Notionsspecifically related to the MCV were rare, as their criticism rather referred to vaccination in general. Illness is not an enemy or the call for 'individual vaccination' Participants' perceptions on health, illness and the immune system were often not in line with evidence-based medicine and underline the relation of VH and CAM.17,34Participants did not want to be considered as 'anti-vaxxers'. They argued to make selective use ofvaccines and weighed every single vaccine for each patient. Thesefindings are in line with Wardle et al. 19and Deml et al.,21who called the pro- vs. anti-vaccination dichotomy into question and sup- ported a more nuanced view of the phenomenon of VH. To understand these findings it is important to be aware of the underlying concepts of CAM, especially HP. HP presumes that aninner energy determines the level of health, whereas illness is per- ceived as 'something from outside' that causes disturbance of the body's energy, which is called 'the vital forces'. In contrast to bio-medicine, HP views symptoms as visible effort of the 'vital forces' torebuild health, and thus, as something positive. 35,36Several partic- ipants believed in an innate intelligence of nature and the body (see Results: Perception on childhood diseases, measles and vaccination),which relates to the concept of 'vital forces', whereas non-naturalmeasures (often called 'external measures' by our participants, i.e.vaccines) are considered an interruption of the innate intelligence. This may be illustrated by the participants' high trust in the child- ren's immune system and its ability to fight childhood diseases,while insisting that young children are too weak to bear a vaccine(see Bean et al. 18) 'Why shouldn't a child get measles?' was a central question raised by many participants. In a similar finding by Deml et al.,19participants used the expression 'the right to be sick!', underlying the belief in beneficial aspects of measles. In our study participants argued that 'individual vaccination' was not for everyone, especially not for lower social classes or unedu-cated persons, as it needed a high level of commitment and know- ledge. Similar notions were also found in other studies among vaccine hesitant parents. 10An Australian study revealed that highly educated parents believed in their ability to control the health oftheir children without vaccines, since their general success enables them to control their lives. 37Consequently, our results underline that VH is associated with healthism, elitism and the belief to standout of the crowd. Patient-centeredness or the frustration with the Austrian medical system Participants frequently indicate d that the most important factor to determine the individual choice of vaccines is the parents' intu-ition. These findings are similar to Attwell et al. 38who described a 'do-it-yourself' attitude in terms of vaccination decisions that was promoted and supported by CAM p roviders. Some participants had difficulties to specify their pre ferred vaccination strategy (tim- ing, quantity, monovalent vs. polyvalent, rejection), as no generalconcept exists in their point of view. Others who indicated a pre-ferred strategy highlighted that every individual decision-makinghad to be acknowledged even if families did not concur with the physician's opinion. These findings are consistent with Deml et al., 19who reported that the decision-making process is some- times considered more important than the definitive selection ofvaccines. Our participants perceived themselves as consultants forhealth topics and communicators on eye-level and they highly refrained from paternalistic medicine. Furthermore, their view on their occupational role differed from the orthodox image of adoctor, as the patient-centeredness and the empowerment of indi-vidual approaches were considered as the most important part ofthe medical service. A study by Reich 39that examined the beliefs of vaccination rejecting, highly educ ated, mostly full-time-mothers, showed similarities to our findings. These mothers believed in amaternal intuition that was more trustworthy than the knowledgeof experts. Some participants mentioned that their patients consulted them (i.e. a CAM practicing 'Wahlarzt'), as they were disappointed by theway their biomedically oriented 'Kassenarzt' treated the vaccinationtopic. A study on reasons for CAM-use among patients with mus-culoskeletal conditions indicated the patients' wish to increase con- trol concerning health decisions and to close a perceived gap of care in terms of time and quality of the physician-patient relationship asimportant factors. 40The current situation in Austria with a fee-for- service scheme, a high workload among GPs and an average con-sultation time of 5 min per patient might counteract trust building physician-patient relationships that are associated with vaccine ac- ceptance. 22,41-43 Distrust towards the medical system and the role of evidence-based-medicine Similar to several other studies, we found distrust towards public health authorities and the pharmaceutical industry (e.g. References 37,38). Peretti-Watel et al.44described the importance of 'trust issues' in the emergence of VH. 'Scientific scepticism hasbeen extended to science itself and fuelled the disenchantment ofscience. [ ...] Consequently, distrust towards science is no longer a sign of ignorance or even obscurantism, but is endorsed by highly educated individuals'. This statement may also be applied to some of our study participants and explain their perception towards vaccinesin general. Barry 45reported that the investigation of the effectiveness of CAM remedies/measures with the principles of evidence-based medicine usually plays an inferior role for CAM practitioners and that the emphasis for evaluating the efficacy of their treatment is focussed ontheir own experience and reports of colleges, friends and familymembers. In our study, the use of the term 'evidence-based medi-cine' was rather vague. Some study participants drafted a contro- versial image of vaccination that was in their point of view 'evidence-based'. In turn, they blamed evidence-based medicine tobe unreliable due to conflicts of interests as a result of financialsupport from pharmaceutical companies. Limitations In the first place, our study aim was not to focus on VH among CAMpracticing doctors. However, we experienced challenges to approachvaccine hesitant doctors who had no CAM background. The herewith presented sample includes 11 CAM-oriented 'Wahla \u00a8rzte' and only one 'Kassenarzt' who practices orthodox medicine. We assume that ourresults may have been different if we had been able to recruit moredoctors from orthodox medicine. Our findings may also be valid for other high-income countries with a high demand for CAM. Nevertheless, they cannot be gener- alized, as participation in the study might have been a result ofparticipants' enhanced interest in the topic. Hence, one has to con-sider that this sample may represent a small, but vocal minority ofCAM-oriented vaccine hesitant doctors.'I'm not an anti-vaxer!'\u2014vaccine hesitancy among physicians 1161Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/31/6/1157/6377220 by guest on 01 June 2022 Conclusion VH among doctors is a complex continuum of emotions, beliefs, narratives and values and is highly related to a perception of health and illness that is deviant to biomedical concepts. Our simultaneousexamination of sentiments concerning the measles and its vaccineindicates that similar notions might be found for other childhooddiseases and its corresponding vaccines (e.g. rubella, pertussis, mumps or varicella), as core elements in questioning the importance of the measles vaccine were the appraisal of the measles as an 'or-dinary childhood disease' and the belief in positive effects arisingfrom it. From the perspective of vaccine hesitant persons it would beillogic to prevent an infection, which is perceived as beneficial and only lethal if handled wrongly, by using a vaccine, which is regarded as harmful. Most participants were settled in their opinion and theirdistrust against the medical system enabled them to justify theirposition. Thus, it seems pointless to specifically address this vocalminority and provide them with public health information. Instead, approaches to mitigate VH among doctors should start at an earlier stage. Firstly, we suggest that information on vaccines and VHshould be more firmly integrated into medical curricula. Secondly,appropriate communication techniques that address VH should be included in postgraduate education. Furthermore, we suggest that 'vaccination advice' should be reim- bursed by the Austrian social insurance in order to guarantee thatinformation seeking patients receive science-based information inadequate quality and duration.

Vaccine hesitant doctors often use the concept of 'individualvaccination' when arguing against vaccination guidelines. Vaccine hesitancy among doctors implies perceptions of healthand illness that are discordant with evidence-based medicine. Vaccine hesitancy is associated with complementary and alter-native medicine.1162 European Journal of Public HealthDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/31/6/1157/6377220 by guest on 01 June 2022 25 Gust DA, Darling N, Kennedy A, Schwartz B.

Thus, the Danish Health Authorities recommend the presence of experienced physicians in the ED. In 2016, consultant-led triage and continuous presence of consultants were introduced at a larger ED inCopenhagen, Denmark. This study investigated whether the employment of consultants in a Danish ED affected the quality of care for acutely admitted medical patients in terms of length of admission, readmission and mor- tality, as well as socioeconomic equality in quality of care delivery. Methods: Admission data were collected during two 7-month periods, one prior to and one after the organizational intervention, with 9869 adult medical patients admitted for up to 48 h in the ED. Linear regression and Cox proportional hazards regression analysesadjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, level of education and employment status were applied. Results: Following the employment of consultants, an overall 11% increase in index-admissions was observed, and 90% of patients were discharged by a consultant with a reduced mean length of admission by 1.4 h (95% CI: 1.0-1.9). No changewas found in in-hospital mortality, readmission or mortality within 90 days after discharge. No change in distri- bution of quality indicators across patients' socioeconomic status was found. Conclusions: Consultants in the ED was found to reduce length of hospitalization without a negative effect on the quality of care for ED-admitted medical patients in general or patients with lower socioeconomic status. ...................... ...................... ...................... ...................... .................The effect of the employment of experienced physicians in the Emergency Department 1163Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/31/6/1157/6377220 by guest "}
