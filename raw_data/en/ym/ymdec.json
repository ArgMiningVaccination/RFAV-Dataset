APhA and NASPA strongly support the proposed 60-day delay of the effective date and urge the agency to rescind this ill-advised final rule that removes shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA) and vasovagal syncope from the Vaccine Injury Table (Table).1 During a pandemic is not the time to make changes to the Vaccine Injury Table, when we are working as a nation to optimiz e the manufacture, distribution, and administration of COVID -19 and other critical vaccinations. Founded in 1852, APhA represents pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, student pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and others interested in improving medicat ion use, advancing patient care, and protecting public health. APhA members provide care in all practice settings, including community pharmacies, hospitals, long -term care facilities, specialty pharmacies, community health centers, physician offices, ambu latory clinics, managed care organizations, hospice settings, and the uniformed services. NASPA, founded in 1927 as the National Council of State Pharmacy Association Executives, is dedicated to enhancing the success of state pharmacy associations in thei r efforts to advance the profession of pharmacy. NASPA's membership is comprised of state pharmacy associations and over 70 other stakeholder organizations. NASPA promotes leadership, sharing, learning, and policy exchange among its members and pharmacy le aders nationwide. 186 Fed. Reg. 6249 . 2 APhA and NASPA urge HRSA to rescind the final rule for the following legal and policy reasons: Legal Issues Contrary to 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 300aa -14(c), HRSA did not provide the required 180 days for public comment on the proposed revisions to the Table . The proposed rule was published on July 20, 2020 , and the comment period closed on January 12, 2021.2 In addition, HRSA did not properly notify the public of the entire revised regulation, 42 CFR \u00a7 100.3(b) -(e), since both the proposed and final rules published in the Federal Register included only the revised Vaccine Injury Table itself, but not the entire revised regulation. Finally, given that HRSA filed the final rule on January 19, 2021 and published it in the Federal Regis ter on January 21, 2021 -- only three and five business days after the comment period closed on January 12th, respectively - leads APhA and NASPA to question whether HRSA adequately considered \" the relevant matter presented \" in the 772 comments on the prop osed rule as required by the Administrative Procedure Act.3 Policy Issues In our comments on the proposed rule, APhA and NASPA joined the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV) as well as the majority of the other commenters in strongly opposing the removal of SIRVA and syncope from the Table due to our concerns that such a move would put a significant damper on vaccine research and development, the willingness of healthcare providers, including pharmacists, to administer vaccine s, as well as the public's willingness to get vaccinated without the protections provided by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP).4 While pharmacists and other immunizers are currently protected from liability for vaccine administration by the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act), that protection ceases at the conclusion of the declared COVID - 19 public health emergency and might not cover all vaccinators in states with different training requirements. As noted above, t he fact that HRSA published the final rule only a few days after the comment period closed shows that the agency rushed to finalize this rule without adequate time to carefully consider the implications of its action. As we stated in our comme nts, SIRVA and vasovagal syncope are \"vaccine -related to be compensable under the VICP. Despite HRSA's contentions to the contrary, the scientific record supporting the addition of SIRVA and syncope to the Table in 2017 has not materially changed. The final rule represents an abrupt about -face in policy without sufficient scientific and medical evidence to support the changes. This final rule threatens our nation's vaccine R&D, vaccine administration, and adverse event repor ting efforts. It is bad public policy and should be rescinded. 2 85 FR 43794 . 3 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (c). 4 See APhA and NASPA Comments to HRSA on Revisions to the Vaccine Injury Table, Jan. 12, 2021, available at: https://www.pharmacist.com/sites/default/files/audience/APhAandNASPACommentstoHRSAon RevisionstotheVaccineInjuryTable_FINAL_1 -12-2021.pdf 3 Furthermore, our organizations dispute HRSA's conclusion in the final rule that removal of SIRVA and syncope from the Table is necessary in order to incentivize proper administration technique. More than 376,000 pharmacists have been trained to administer vaccines for patients of all ages. They are educated regarding appropriate vaccination technique in accordance with CDC guidelines, and the management of potential adverse events such as syncop e. Appropriate vaccination technique is reinforced through continuing education programming and other sources of information. Pharmacists take their responsibility to properly administer vaccines very seriously, and the removal of SIRVA and syncope from th e Vaccine Injury Table will not further incentivize them to use proper technique. Having SIRVA and syncope within the Table keeps the potential of the injury in front of providers. Removing them might discourage providers from vaccinating if they are conce rned about being sued in court for these vaccine injuries. In order to preserve widespread access to vaccines and provide compensation to victims of vaccine injuries, APhA and NASPA urge HRSA to rescind this final rule. Our members are actively participat ing in the nationwide COVID -19 vaccine administration effort and look forward to continuing to work on vaccination and other public health initiatives with HHS and the Biden Administration.
