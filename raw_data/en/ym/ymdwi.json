Dr. Glidden had served as interim chief quality officer since June 2021. In that capacity, Glidden redesigned Upstate's Quality Management System and championed efforts to develop data-supported strategies to improve quality. He also actively cham- pioned efforts to reduce overall and sepsis-related mortality, and was an active partner in Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI) efforts. \"We are fortunate to have Dr. Glidden in this impor- tant role at Upstate,\" says Chief Medical Officer Amy Tucker, MD. \"He has made great contributions to our quality mission in his interim role, and we look forward to further successes ahead.\"Glidden serves as chair of multiple Upstate quality committees, including the Quality Management Over- sight, Weekly Event Review, and Clinical Quality Improvement Committees. Glidden joined Upstate Medical University in 2006 and has served as the director of the Internal Medicine Clerkship, the medical director of Utilization Manage- ment and Clinical Documentation Improvement, and as the associate chief medical officer. A graduate of the Norton College of Medicine, Glidden remained at Upstate to complete an internal medicine internship, residency, and chief residency. He has received numerous awards for his work and leadership, including the Faculty Gold Standard Award, Upstate President's Award, Best Hospital Award, and Resident Teaching Award. Upstate Medical Students Bring Books and Inspiration to Local Elementary School Students from Upstate Medical University's chapter of the Student National Medical Association (SNMA) distributed dozens of books to students in kindergarten through third grade at Van Duyn Elementary School in Syracuse as part of their outreach efforts to instill in students that anything is possible for anyone. The children's books, which were donated during an early semester book drive and dis- tributed November 30, reflected a rainbow of multicultural inspirational stories that kids could read and likely see their reflection in the pages. \"Books that reflect who you are are so important to children at this age,\" said Julian Yeboah, a second-year medical student from Brooklyn. \"I know from my own experience how important these opportunities are.\" In addition to reading to the classes, the medical students also spoke about the work and education it takes to succeed in the medical field and in science when the principal asked each to highlight the educational journey that had brought them to medical school. \"She made us all realize the sacrifices and deter mination each of us has invested in our studies,\" Yeboah said. \"I think that helped her students understand what it takes to succeed.\" On its Facebook page, Van Duyn thanked the Upstate students for the visit: Our stu-dents were \"thrilled to speak with the future doctors and to hear their journey to medical school. The books, autographs and time will remain a treasure in all of our hearts.\" SNMA is a national organization aimed at supporting future students from underrepre- sented populations to enter medical school. The organization at Upstate is supported by Nakeia Chambers, Upstate's director of multi- cultural affairs and student inclusion.

Helping Hands for Forgotten Feet (HHFF) was started by a group of Upstate medical students about 10 years ago and is now one of Upstate's Service-Learning groups. Run by four student leaders, a group of first- and second-year medical students meet monthly at the shelter to run the clinic with the help of Barbara Feuerstein, MD '84, associate professor of medicine, who oversees the program, and several local podiatrists who volunteer their time. Dr. Feuerstein, an endocrinologist at the Joslin Center, does a general health screening that includes a diabetes screening with the help of the students. She says men and women who experience homelessness often have foot issues because they are on their feet all day, often wearing old shoes that are either too small or too big and without a way to care for their feet. The clinic provides services from bathing to nail and callous trimming, to fungus and wound care and neuropathy care. Second-year medical student Dominique Alexis says the clinic serves about 20 to 25 patients each month. Recently, a return patient addressed a volunteer by name and asked to be screened by him. \"It was a small interaction, but I think that it is a testament to the program being a consis- tent and trusting place for these individuals and to our student volunteers who are dedicated to serving,\" Alexis says. Feuerstein says students treat the patients with amazing respect, dignity, and care. \"They open their hearts to them,\" she says. The Rescue Mission Alliance is thrilled with contributions of the clinic volunteers, said Mackenzie Naum, senior director of development, regarding the award. \"This team is an important piece of putting love into action here in the Syracuse commu- nity,\" Naum says.Accepting the award from the Rescue Mission Alliance are medical stu- dents Dominique Alexis '25, Elsa Diaw '26, Jessica and Simone Seward, director of Upstate's Center for Community Engagement. Findings of Upstate-led Clinical Trial Provide New Treatment Options A clinical trial led by Upstate Medical University radia- tion oncologist Jeffrey Bogart, MD '89, may have major implications for the treatment of small cell lung cancer. The study, \"High-Dose Once-Daily Thoracic Radio- therapy in Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer,\" was published January 9 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. About 30,000 people are diagnosed with small cell lung cancer each year, which accounts for about 15 to 20 percent of all lung cancer patients. The Bogart-led clinical trial was the largest trial in limited-stage small cell lung cancer ever performed, including more than 700 patients throughout the United States from 2008 to 2019. Results showed similar out- comes and long-term survival in patients treated with once-a-day versus twice-a-day radiotherapy. Previously, the twice-a-day regime was recommended as standard, but only 15 percent of patients nationwide opted for twice-daily radiation treatments due to the challenge of coming in for appointments two times each day. Bogart says that a higher dose of radiation given once a day over seven weeks showed no statistical differ- ence in survival rates than the twice-a-day regimen. He says technology today is much more advanced than it was 30 years ago, allowing very focused treatment with image guidance that can produce targeted radiation, resulting with fewer side effects. Bogart says the study's publication in the Journal of Clinical Oncology has the capacity to change care. \"It is one of the top cancer journals in the world, with high visibility and oncology physicians will see the study outcomes and it will impact the patterns of care,\" he says. \"It allows patients a real choice, understanding that there may be some differences in side effects, or their ability to complete the longer therapy, but now they know both regimens can be associated with good outcomes,\" he said. Bogart says the next step in assessing the benefit of this treatment protocol is to look at subpopulations, for example, based on gender or age. \"The goal over time is to get away from the one- size-fits-all approach to now offer better, more personal- ized therapy,\" Bogart says. \"The findings of this study move us in that direction. Our findings need to be con- firmed in subsequent trials, but it can provide a lot of information to help design future trials as well.\" UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023 3 COURT YARDUpstate Awarded $1.1 Million to Establish Suicide Prevention Center UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY HAS received $1.1 million in federal funds to establish a Suicide Prevention Center to provide better access to effective prevention and treatment strategies for high-risk youth and young adults in Central New York. The primary mission of the new center will be to create and foster a continuum of care, from primary pre vention to case identification to early intervention to recovery-based treatment. The center will coordinate and expand current cutting-edge interventions developed and applied at Upstate, and also support the prevention initiatives currently being planned in school districts across Central New York through training, outreach, and other activities. \"With all of our current efforts, and now the grant to help coordinate them, I am hopeful that we can move the needle on suicide here in Onondaga County,\" says Robert Gregory, MD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. \"We have many efforts in diverse directions but there isn't a single umbrella they all fall under. To have the entire spectrum of a continuum of care that's well coordi- nated would be a great goal.\" According to Gregory, suicide rates among youth and young adults have almost doubled in frequency since 2013 and Onondaga County has one of the highest suicide rates overall in New York state. \"There has been a problem with either long waiting lists or a revolving door where people are stuck in chronic depression and other illnesses,\" Gregory said. \"They go in and out of the hospital or in and out of CPEP for suicide, too often ending in death or despair or losing hope through that cycle.\" The Suicide Treatment Center is the newest of Upstate's ground-breaking initiatives. In 2017, Gregory started the Psych- iatry High Risk Program (PHRP) for suicidal youth and young adults, an innovative program focused on trans- formational healing and recovery, using an evidence-based treatment called dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy, which was also developed at Upstate. The program has served more than 600 indi- viduals and has demonstrated more than a 90-percent reduction in hospitaliza- tions and other outcomes and is the only program of its kind in the country. The PHRP was recently awarded the designation as \"a best practice in suicide prevention\" by the national Suicide Prevention Resource Center. Additionally, Upstate is New York's principal site for the Zero Suicide (ZS) Initiative. As part of the initiative, Upstate established universal suicide screening protocols and safety planning in its adult emergency rooms and psych iatric units. In 2019, the ZS initiative was expanded to the adolescent behavioral unit. In 2020, Upstate helped expand a brief, innovative, evidence-based treat- ment program called Attempted Short Suicide Intervention Program (ASSIP) for adults attempting suicide. ASSIP has been shown to reduce suicide attempts and hospitalizations in high-risk adults. Upstate is one of the leading institutions in the U.S. providing ASSIP to suicidal individuals and is a site for a National Institute of Mental Health grant further evaluating its effectiveness.In 2020, Upstate also established the first partial hospitalization program for suicidal adolescents in the region, and involves daily application of dialec- tical behavior therapy for adolescents (DBT-A), for teens, and their families. DBT-A is the most firmly established treatment for suicidal adolescents and is an important component in a continuum of care. Upstate also established a dedi- cated interventional psychiatry program for adults suffering from treatment- resistant depression and suicide idea- tion, adding enhanced electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stim- ulation, vagal nerve stimulation services, and instituting an esket- amine treatment program. Upstate was one of the sites for the initial develop- ment of vagal nerve stimulation therapy and one of the only clinical sites offering ongoing programming on a wide scale. \"We should be proud of our efforts at Upstate,\" Gregory said. \"We have some extraordinary faculty members who have made great strides in suicide prevention. We are really at the forefront.\"Robert Gregory, MD, at podium, speaks about the establishment of a suicide prevention center at Upstate. 4 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023 COURT YARDJames Knoll, MD James Knoll, MD, Elected President of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Upstate's James L. Knoll, IV, MD, has been elected as the 49th president of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law (AAPL), an organization of psychiatrists dedicated to excellence in practice, teaching, and research in forensic psychiatry. Knoll joined Upstate in 2006 and is professor of psychiatry and director of forensic psychiatry. He serves as clinical director of Central New York Psychiatric Center, a secure inpatient forensic psychiatric hospital in Marcy, New York, and has served as an expert witness in cases of national prominence such as the \"Cleveland strangler\" serial murder case of Anthony Sowell, and the \"137 shots\" Cleveland Police shooting case. Knoll is emeritus editor-in-chief of Psychiatric Times and has been widely published on the subject of mass violence. He serves as committee chair on threat assessment for the Onondaga County School Safety Task Force, is an affiliate fellow of the International Criminal Investigative Analysis Fellowship, and teaches basic psychiatry and the law to FBI agents at the National Academy in Quantico.Infectious disease expert Kristopher Paolino, MD, left, says the treatment center will strengthen the care for patients with Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. Dr. Paolino participated in a press conference with U.S. Rep. John Katko in July 2021. Katko was instrumental in bringing funding for the treatment center to Upstate. Upstate To Launch Multidisciplinary Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Treatment Center Upstate Medical University will launch a Multidisci - plinary Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Treatment Center, thanks to a $898,000 grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration. The center will centralize and supp le ment Upstate's existing resources for combatting tick-borne disease, including the Vector Biocontainment Laboratory, which is devoted to studying both vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens. This preexisting expertise will allow Upstate to devote federal funding for the design, construction, and equipment costs asso ciated with establishing the center. The tick surveillance program at Upstate has tested more than 27,000 ticks since it began in 2019, and about a third of those ticks have been found to carry one or more patho- gens or disease-causing organisms. \"We have an increased number of patients who require treatment for tick- borne diseases and we need better education, not only for patients, but for providers on how to iden- tify some of these diseases we are seeing,\" says Kristo- pher Paolino, MD, assistant professor of microbiology and immunology and a specialist in Lyme disease care. \"Having a Lyme disease and tick-borne disease clinical center will be a way to provide patients and providers the tools they need to protect themselves and also encourage patients to seek appropriate treat- ment in a timely manner. The longer someone goes with untreated Lyme disease the more likely they are going to have chronic symptoms.\" The new center will be multidisciplinary in approach. Represented specialties will include infectious diseases, rheumatology, neurology, physical and occupational therapy, pain management, psychiatry, and integrative medicine. Additional specialties will be engaged as required. Using this approach, diagnostic and treatment plans will be highly coordinated, will improve care effi- ciency, and move patients toward faster recovery. \"We have an increased number of patients who require treat- ment for tick-borne diseases and we need better education, not only for patients, but for providers... \" \u2014Kristopher Paolino, MD UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023 5 COURT YARDUpstate's Frank Middleton, PhD, played a key role in the development of a saliva test for concussion that was awarded a patent for Quadrant Biosciences, Penn State College of Medicine, and the SUNY Research Foundation.Upstate Research Leads to Patent for Saliva Concussion Test A patent for a saliva test used to analyze and predict the occurrence of mild traumatic brain injury and concussion symptoms that was developed through research at Upstate Medical University and Penn State College of Medicine has been awarded to Quadrant Biosciences, SUNY Research Foundation, and Penn State College of Medicine. Quadrant is a StartUP NY company based at the Central New York Biotech Accelerator. The patented research was led by Upstate Professor Frank Middleton, PhD, and Steve Hicks, MD/PhD '12, now at Penn State College of Medicine, and focused on young adult and pediatric populations, who are most at risk for head injuries. Hicks earned his doctorates and completed his residency at Upstate. \"Our motivation for developing this technology was to prevent further harm to the kids, athletes, and adults who experience mild, moderate, or repetitive head impacts,\" says Middleton. \"While most of the field has focused on peripheral blood measures, for the past decade we worked extensively to establish the utility of quanti- fying small RNA molecules in saliva as predictors of con- cussion or long-lasting symptoms from head impacts.\" The patent is a transformative piece of intellectual property that Quadrant is using to develop its Clarifi mTBI Saliva Test, expected to be available in late 2023. Quadrant has started discussions about potentially licensing this technology to third-parties. This is the second patent awarded in less than one year to Quadrant and its partners. In March 2022, a patent was issued from the USPTO for its development of a saliva-based, epigenetic autism diagnostic aid; this same technology received FDA Breakthrough Device designation in April 2021. Kathryn Anderson, MD, PhD Kathryn Anderson, MD, PhD, Named Onondaga County Health Commissioner Upstate infectious disease expert Kathryn Anderson, MD, PhD, began a four-year term as Onondaga County health commissioner on November 7, 2022. Dr. Anderson, associate professor of microbiology and immunology, was part of the Upstate team that put together the first model of how COVID-19 could spread through Central New York in the early days of the pan- demic and became integrally involved helping Onon- daga County officials in their response to COVID. Anderson was recruited to Upstate in 2019 by Timothy Endy, MD, MPH, and Stephen Thomas, MD, who had been colleagues at the Walter Reed Army Insti- tute of Research in Maryland. She also previously worked at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Anderson's research includes field epidemiology and respiratory viral disease spread and transmission, including extensive research on Dengue, a mosquito- borne virus common in the Caribbean, Central and South America, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Anderson earned her MD and PhD in epidemiology at Emory University and completed residency in internal medicine/global health at the University of Minnesota. 6 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023Upstate's Norton College of Medicine is committed to training the next generation of public health leaders to address issues ranging from local infant mortality rates to worldwide pandemics. BY REN\u00c9E GEARHART LEVY As a landscape architect working in land planning and design, Meghan Hazer \u00c1lvarez, MS, MPH '15, was frustrated that her work for private design firms might actually be reinforcing some of the environmental injustices she was so concerned about. She set out to get her master's degree from the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) in Syracuse, drafting a thesis proposal on exposure to greenspace and human stress. Then she learned that neighboring Upstate Medical University offered a master's degree in public health (MPH). After sampling a few classes, \u00c1lvarez decided to pursue dual degrees. \"It seemed a natural fit,\" she says. \"Designers focus on the connection between design and how it affects environmental outcomes and human behavior, while public health focuses, in part, on how behavior and environments affect human health outcomes.\" \u00c1lvarez says learning about built environment factors, social determinants, and health outcomes was like finding a missing puzzle piece. Since earning her degrees, she has served as a public health consultant for design projects and pursued grant-funded research investigating the degree to which health can be prioritized alongside sustain- ability in green building platforms. She is currently a city planner for the Baltimore City Department of Public Works, where she integrates public health concepts into stormwater planning work. \"Whether someone cares about the envi ron ment or people, it is critical to understand how decisions we make to shape the built environment affect both,\" she says. An Ounce of UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023 7 A more typical MPH student is Erica Bird, MPH '18, who started working in public health when she joined the National Health Corps (Americorps) after college and was placed in the Allegheny County Health Department in Pittsburgh. She later became a project coordinator in the chronic disease prevention program, and, looking to gain skills in program development and evaluation and data analysis, enrolled in Upstate's MPH program. As part of her studies, Bird interned with the Madison County Health Department, working on a project to address the high burden of lung cancer. \"The experience enhanced my ability to translate research into recommendations for effective programs and policies,\" she says. It also landed her a job. After earning her degree, she accepted a position as a health statistician with the department. Today, she serves as the deputy director of public health for Madison County. \"I use skills learned in Upstate's MPH coursework every day,\" she says. Upstate's MPH program was launched in 2009 by the Norton College of Medicine to prepare students to investigate and manage public health problems from a population-based perspective. While all MPH degree programs have a similar mission, the Upstate program is rare in being part of a medical school, rather than a school of public health or some other location within a university. With the Norton College of Medicine an established provider of physicians to the Central New York region, the goal was to become equally integral to public health training. The many facets of public health work include conducting scientific research, tracking disease outbreaks, studying statistics related to health outcomes such as nutrition, vaccination, or alcohol and drug use, and using that information to create science-based solutions to problems, as well as communicating that information to the public in a way that leads to adoption of healthy behaviors. \"Public health and medicine are parallel pathways that don't necessarily function in overlapping ways,\" says Christopher Morley, PhD, chair of Upstate's Department of Public Health and Preventive Erica Bird, MPH '18 As a city planner in Baltimore, Meghan Hazer \u00c1lvarez, MS, MPH '15 (left and above), incorporates public health concepts into her work in stormwater planning.8 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023Medicine. \"While medicine is focused on individual patient care and diagnosis and treatment of disease, public health looks through a population or community-based lens to address problems. The location of the MPH program within the Norton College of Medicine auto matically provides students with opportunities that are different from many other programs because of access to our clinical programs, hospitals, and a wide variety of research areas.\" Dr. Morley has been involved with the MPH program since the planning stages, along with Martha Wojtowycz, PhD, director. The idea for the program began germinating shortly after Public Health and Preventive Medicine was reestablished as a department within the Norton College of Medicine in 2006. The MPH program accepted its first students in 2009. The following year, the joint MD/MPH program was established, and accepted its first dual-degree students in 2010. Over the course of its first dozen years, the program has expanded from a general curriculum to one that allows students to choose from three tracks of study: public health methods; population health for clinicians; or global health and translational science. \"Our students come from varied backgrounds and have different career goals,\" says Wojtowycz. \"Having these tracks designed around our areas of strength helps students get the training they desire to achieve those goals. The commonality is that they all have an interest in thinking about the population as a whole rather than individual patients.\" DEVELOPING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE The program attracts three main groups of students: those who are strictly MPH students, attending full or part time; medical students at Upstate who have chosen to pursue a dual MD/MPH degree; and Upstate Public Health Scholars, a pathway program for students from under-represented, historically repressed, or disadvantaged backgrounds to earn admission into the MD program, intended to diversify medicine. \"The Public Health Scholars Program has shifted my perspective on health and deepened my understanding of the pathophysiology of disease,\" says Samantha Hanley, MD/MPH '25. \"It has been eye opening yet heartbreaking to see how factors outside the traditional boundaries of healthcare delivery shape and propel disease. Health truly does start within our homes, schools, workplaces, neigh- borhoods and communities.\" Now a second-year Upstate medical student, Hanley says her goal is to adopt a public health approach to medicine to address the psychosocial symptoms that precipitate and drive illness. \"I believe that working to bridge the gap between traditional medicine and public health will ultimately lead to more effective and equitable healthcare,\" she says. K yle Plante, MD '20, MPH '16, also completed his MPH through the Public Health Scholars program before enrolling in the Norton College of Medicine. \"When I was considering the program, I met with Dr. Morley, who sat down with me and discussed the things that I could do with an MPH degree and the skills that I would learn through the program. I had always been interested in health services and outcomes research, and the program offered many opportunities to explore this field more,\" says Dr. Plante, who is currently a chief resident in family medicine in the Department of Family and Community Medicine of Northwestern University. \"Having the training in public health and preventive medicine provided an extremely valuable lens through which to view medical school. Without that experience, I am not sure if I would have ended up in a primary care field or within academia.\" Kyle Plante, MD '20, MPH '16, chief resident in family medicine at Northwestern University\"It has been eye opening yet heart- breaking to see how factors outside the traditional bound- aries of healthcare delivery shape and propel disease. Health truly does start within our homes, schools, workplaces, neighborhoods and communities.\" \u2014 SAMANTHA HANLEY, MD/MPH '25 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023 9 Medical students who enroll as MD/MPH students begin their programs with a year of MPH coursework, followed by four years of medical school. Those who choose to pursue an MPH later typically pause their medical studies for a year to complete the public health curriculum and then resume medical school. One of those is Nicole Cifra, MD/MPH '16, MHPEd, who recently graduated from an adolescent medicine fellowship and is now an attending physician at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and a specialist in eating disorders. \"I started medical school thinking I would do primary care pediatrics but became interested in getting an MPH during my first year to develop a context for my medical practice on a larger scale, focusing on prevention, systematic issues that impact health, health communi- cation, and advocacy,\" she says. A spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, Cifra says one of the most important things she took from her public health education was knowledge about health \"While medicine is focused on individual patient care and diagnosis and treatment of disease, public health looks through a population or community-based lens to address problems. . . .\" \u2014 CHRISTOPHER MORLEY, PHD Nicole Cifra, MD/MPH '16, MHPEd, is a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. 10 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023communication. \"The only media training I received was during the MPH program, which was also critical in devel- oping my interest in the eating disorders field.\" Regardless of the pathway, there is no separation among different types of students within the program. \"They enter as a cohort and are purposefully mixed up for group activities,\" says Telisa Stewart, MPH, DrPH, associate director of the MPH program. \"Every individual has a set of experiences and training that is unique to them. We want a whole host of perspectives to yield a more robust learning experience.\" That diversity mimics the inter- disciplinary nature of public health. \"When we have class discussions, it's great to see multiple views of the problem at hand,\" says Wojtowycz. \"What is the clinical view? What is the social work perspective? What are people trained in education bringing? What are people trained in sociology or economics bringing? And we also have students from other countries, so we often get an interna- tional perspective.\" All MPH students complete a clerkship-like experience, called the Applied Practical Experience (APE), based on their interests. These range from working with bench science researchers to translate that information to public health, to working in the hospital doing quality improve ment projects, to working at county health departments on projects ranging from lead poisoning and maternal-child health to case management of radon and asbestos exposure. Students in the global health track can work locally with refugee communities or at sites abroad. As part of their APE, they also produce two high-quality \"deliverables,\" such as adapting existing agency publications to be culturally appropriate, writing a grant application, or creating a handbook. Joshua Anbar, MPH '15, DrPH, recalls working on a series of grand rounds about the imple- mentation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \"This experience, along with a legion of others, broadened my perspective on understanding how public health research is implemented into patient care as well as highlighting the critical role physicians and other healthcare providers play in communicating public health information to the community at large,\" he says. Anbar went on to earn a doctorate in public health and is an assistant teaching professor at the College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University, where he teaches courses on healthcare administration and policy. In addition to the full degree program, the department also offers a Certificate of Advance Study in Public Health, earned by taking any 15 credits in the program. \"This is a popular option for mid-career professionals, including people working in public health who wish additional training as well as for working clinicians,\" says Morley. Residents in Upstate's new family medicine residency at Community General Hospital are given the option to complete the CAS in public health as a component of their training. This summer, a new micro- credential will be offered to medical students, a two-course intro- ductory sequence in epidemiology and biostatistics. \"They will learn some basic concepts and then do a project that demonstrates they understand them,\" says Wojtowycz. \"The goal is to help them learn key concepts to more critically interpret medical literature and apply that to their patients.\" Students who complete the sequence will receive a special designation on their transcript and diploma. While he values the mix of all students who come to the program, Morley says the MD/ MPH students provide one important validation to its value: an extra year of education and tuition. \"These are students who already have a very long path, and in many cases, substantial student debt. The fact they are willing to add to that to earn an additional degree speaks volumes,\" says Morley. PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE SPOTLIGHT The Norton College of Medicine graduated its first MPH students in 2011 and its first dual degree MD/MPH students in 2012. A decade-plus later, there is no doubt about the success of the endeavor. Students in the program don't just earn a credential, they become part of a community of public health professionals who seek each other out for advice and expertise. \"I can't tell you the countless numbers of students who reach out wanting to get some insight into a particular project or issue that they're working on,\" says Stewart. \"Sometimes those students bring us on to collaborate on projects.\" In addition to the cadre of graduates working in the field, the creation of the MPH program has paid dividends throughout the College, strengthening the research profile of faculty and the preventive health components of the medical school curriculum. \"Historically, medical education has focused on human anatomy and on diagnosing and treating disease,\" says Stewart. \"More recently, clinical medicine fields have started to understand how much public health influences Joshua Anbar, MPH '15 \"Given the leadership role Upstate has played with COVID response, students have received first- hand exposure to dealing with a public health crisis.\" \u2014 CHRISTOPHER MORLEY, PHD UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023 11 human behavior, health impacts, and peoples' ability to adhere to prevention and treatment protocols. When we are teaching medical students, we are bringing our real- world expertise and tailoring it to their needs.\" The Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine has been part of every incident command at Upstate related to COVID-19, and more recently, RSV . As a result, faculty members have initiated various research projects related to the rollout of vaccines and vaccine acceptance that have involved MPH students. \"Given the leadership role Upstate has played with COVID response, students have received first-hand exposure to dealing with a public health crisis,\" says Morley. That was evident to Christine Ortiz, MD/MPH '25, a first-generation Dominican-American student who earned her degree through the Public Health Scholars program and is currently a second-year Upstate medical student. \"Getting a public health degree in the middle of the pandemic was very eye-opening in terms of the work that goes into preventative medicine and public health, especially in communicating with communities that are historically underserved,\" she says. \"We can best serve our communities when we are able to properly share important information on health problems in culturally sensitive ways, such as when we have to convey the importance of vaccination.\" If the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated anything, it's the importance to build the infrastructure of a strong public health workforce trained to analyze health data and statistics, create programs and evaluate their effec- tiveness, and to understand how social determinants and environment impact health behaviors and outcomes. \"This has become a pinnacle point for the field of public health,\" says Stewart. \"It's not just COVID, but RSV , flu, and in our area, the increase in tick-borne illnesses, and a whole host of other emerging problems. It became evident that people needed to have specific public health skills to address health issues on a population level, such as training on evidence-based health messages, behavioral change science, data and analytic skills, and epidemiological surveillance, to name a few. We've seen an increase in people coming forward as they realize they need this additional training and we're excited to teach them these skills.\" 7 Christine Ortiz, MD/MPH '25, and Samantha Hanley, MD/ MPH '25, are earning dual degrees in public health and medicine through Upstate's Public Health Scholars Program.\"We can best serve our communities when we are able to properly share important information on health problems in culturally sensitive ways, such as when we have to convey the importance of vaccination.\" \u2014CHRISTINE ORTIZ, MD/MPH '2512 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023It's a given that doctors pursue medical careers because they want to help people. But when physi- cians want to influence health on a larger scale, they often look to public health careers. Long before Upstate Medical University offered a master's in public health program, Norton College of Medi cine graduates have sought out the credential to impact health care at the population level. Here are a few of their stories. PROFILES BY REN\u00c9E GEARHART LEVYBradley Woodruff, MD '80, MPH NUTRITION EPIDEMIOLOGIST Wheat flour in much of the Western world is fortified with both iron and folic acid since the association between folic acid insufficiency and neural tube defects was discovered 25 years ago. In Vietnam, fish sauce is fortified with iron to combat anemia. Making the fortification of staple foods by manufacturers mandatory is typically the result of data from epidemiological micronutrient studies conducted by experts such as Bradley Woodruff, MD '80, MPH. An epidemiologist and international health and nutrition expert, Dr. Woodruff has spent nearly four decades working in the field of international population health, the last half focused on nutrition and micronutrient assessment. \"There are a lot of mistaken ideas about public health that are not based on data,\" he says. \"I see my mission as gathering data that can be under- stood by program decision makers and then used to implement or modify programs and interventions that are based on scientific evidence,\" he says. Dr. Woodruff did not set out to have a public health career. He was in his second year of surgical residency at Upstate Medical University when the GMENAC report was released, a comprehensive study of medical manpower needs in the United States for the next 10 or 20 years. Woodruff was dismayed to see that there was an oversupply of general surgeons in the areas of the country he was interested in living and working. \"There were two logical paths: pursuing a surgical subspecialty or moving somewhere that I didn't want to go to,\" he recalls. \"I didn't want to do either.\"Public Health in UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023 13 What he wanted to do\u2014after four years of medical school and two years of residency\u2014was to travel. He left his residency and ended up volunteering at mission hospitals in Benin and Kenya. \"That's where I realized that curative medicine didn't really make much difference in the overall health of a pop ulation,\" he says. \"Sure, you can make a difference in one person's life, but if you really want to make a big difference, it's public health all the way.\" Woodruff returned to the United States to pursue a master's degree in public health from Johns Hopkins University, with a concentration in epidemiology and global health. He was then accepted into the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)'s two-year Epidemic Intelligence Service training program, which he followed with a one-year preventive medicine residency at the CDC in Atlanta. Woodruff was hooked. Although he was assigned to the CDC's hepatitis branch from 1989 to 1996, he was regularly \"borrowed\" to respond to humanitarian emergencies around the world. \"Many of the missions were at the request of a UN agency, often UNICEF. And UNICEF at heart is not really a public health agency, so they don't really know what epidemiologists do,\" he says. \"I would hit the ground and figure out what UNICEF was responsible for and what role I could play.\" In Goma, Zaire, for example, UNICEF had responsi- bility for supervising centers for unaccompanied children. \"These were basically orphanages for children whose parents had died of cholera or dysentery,\" says Woodruff. \"There were 12 or 13 such institutions with very little coordination or health supervision among them.\" Woodruff made himself health coordinator, visiting each site, making recommenda- tions, and establishing a surveil- lance system for illness and death to centralize records and monitor health status. In 1996, Woodruff officially joined what had become the International Emergency Refugee Health Branch, his work becoming increasingly focused on nutrition assessment, having worked on a major nutrition assessment of Palestinian refugee camps in the Middle East; conducted health needs assessments of Tajikistan and Afghanistan after their civil wars; and investigated adolescent and adult malnu- trition in Kenya and Nepal. Having narrowed his area of interest and expertise, he joined the CDC's International Micronutrient Malnutrition Assess ment program in 2004 as the senior medical epidemiologist, conducting nutrition surveys in Papua New Guinea and Jordan. Woodruff retired from the CDC in 2007 and continued the same type of work independently as a consultant, assisting with nutrition and micronutrient assessment surveys of Georgia and Mongolia. In 2011, he joined forces with two colleagues from Geneva who had formed a consulting company to assist with nutrition research and evaluations. Although the COVID-19 pandemic put a temporary hold on travel, they recently completed a micronutrient assessment survey in Montenegro. \"We're providing the facts, and then we're formulating those facts into specific recommendations for that pop u- la tion and that government,\" he explains. Woodruff, who now lives in Victoria, British Columbia, has received numerous service honors from the United States Public Health Service for his work, as well as the Secretary's Award for Distinguished Service from the Department of Health and Human Services in 2000, the Charles C. Shepard Award for Outstanding Scientific Contribution to Public Health in 2003, and the Distin- guished Alumnus Award from the Upstate Medical Alumni Foundation in 2010. He says the pandemic has demonstrated the need for public health practitioners. \"We will need public health practitioners forever to assist in the detection and control of communicable disease outbreaks,\" says Woodruff. \"And even more so, we need well-trained experts for monitoring the consequences of poor nutrition and chronic disease and designing interventions to prevent these consequences.\"Bradley Woodruff, MD '80, MPH (center), in Kosovo during the refugee crisis in 1999. 14 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023Lori Fantry, MD '85, MPH HIV EXPERT As a young internist caring for homeless patients in Baltimore in the early 1990s, Lori Fantry, MD '85, MPH, was inundated with patients with HIV . \"It was overwhelming,\"she recalls. While many physicians were afraid of treating patients with HIV/AIDS, Dr. Fantry chose to make it her focus. She left her position as director of the internal medicine residency program at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center to join the Baltimore City Health Department, serving as medical director of the city's Sexually Trans- mitted Disease/HIV Program and running the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) program. But it didn't take long for her to become frustrated by the lack of progress. \"The people were great, but it was a system where it was hard to make any break- throughs,\" she says. Seeking the skills to set policy and be a leader in the sphere of public health, Fantry earned her master's in public health from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, followed by a fellowship in infectious diseases at the University of Maryland Medical Center. She joined the faculty of University of Maryland School of Medicine, and for nearly 20 years, ran the Evelyn Jordan Center, which served some 2,000 HIV patients annually, most of them indigent. \"Having my MPH was what really prepared me to do that,\" she says. In addition to treating patients in the clinic, Fantry focused on quality improvement. Years before the advent of EPIC, she created an electronic record system specific to HIV for the clinic. At the same time, she became involved with HIV medicine both regionally and nationally, serving as a committee member of the American Academy of HIV Medicine, as a peer reviewer for the National Institutes of Health for HIV/AIDS clinical trials and research, and for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Center for AIDS Research. Fantry says the motivation for her work was simple: the patients. \"These are people who in many cases are not accepted by society. They're so grateful to have a doctor who will actually talk to them as a person,\" she says. \"It's not all medical; it's about respect.\" In 2016, Fantry and her husband, George Fantry, MD '84, left Baltimore for Tucson, Arizona, where they both joined the University of Arizona College of Medicine: George as Dean of Student Affairs and Lori as professor of medicine, and associate clinical director, Infectious Diseases Division. She currently is the HIV clinical and education programs director. She also served as the HIV Translational Research Program Director and medical director of the Banner Refugee Screening Clinic and Pacific AIDS Education Training Center. Despite her extensive expertise, Fantry says she faced a steep learning curve treating a different patient population. In Baltimore, her patients were primarily poor, black, and had acquired their infections from injection drug use, while in Tucson, many were Hispanic and the majority had acquired HIV from sex with other men. The patient population is also much more transient. \"Treating STI's has become a bigger focus of what I do here,\" she says, which included 20 cases of Monkeypox last August and September. One of her major efforts has been working with the Pima County Health Department to give out HIV preex- posure prophylaxis, HIV-1 PrEP . \"In 2018, we did a survey and found that only 20 percent of people knew there was a medication to prevent HIV ,\" Fantry says. This helped raise awareness and help led the health department to start a PrEP program, which launched January 31, 2022. Another research project focuses on the use of statins to reduce the risk of heart disease in people with HIV , part of a multi-center, multi-nation study. Fantry says the advent of successful medications and treatment protocols for HIV has changed her work from trying to save people's lives to mostly preventive medicine. \"I'm focused on anal cancer and colon cancer screenings, heart disease and bone loss,\" she says. \"Maybe that's my public health mindset.\" Penny Borenstein, MD '88, MPH COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADER Following her first year of medical school at Upstate Medical University, Penny Borenstein, MD '88, MPH, spent the summer volunteering at a family planning center in Columbia, South America. As a fourth-year student, she did an elective rotation with the director of the Onondaga County Health Department and another working at a rural health clinic in the Philippines. \"Culturally, the practice of medicine was quite different,\" she says. \"It furthered my notion that healthcare was only a piece of what contributes to the health and wellness of communities.\"Lori Fantry, MD '85, MPH UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023 15 After medical school, Dr. Borenstein began a residency in pediatrics at the University of Connecticut. But she realized her interests were more aligned with public health and stopped after one year, switching to a residency in preventive health at the State of Maryland Department of Health, which included getting her master's in public health at Johns Hopkins. Borenstein spent the next seven years working in the Baltimore City Health Department, including posts as director of the Bureau of Immunization and assistant commissioner of health. She then spent six years as health officer for Howard County, Maryland. Since 2008, Dr. Borenstein has served as health officer/ public health director for the San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department in San Luis Obispo, California. In all of her posts, she has kept a hand in clinical medicine, whether practicing part-time pediatrics, working in reproductive health or immunization clinics, or treating patients with tuberculosis. \"I have found it to be a nice marriage of understanding what individual patients experience with the healthcare system, and also doing a lot of policy work at a community or population level,\" she says. \"Both are important to me, but doing the population health management has been very rewarding to see wholesale improvements and communities experience better health models.\" One of those is tobacco policy. San Luis Obispo was the first community in the world to ban smoking in any business environment. Before the state of California passed a similar law, the community banned the sale of flavored vape products. \"Those kinds of things really impact morbidity and mortality,\" she says. For two years, Borenstein was totally focused on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, including substantial pushback on COVID restrictions, mask wearing, and vaccinations. \"People think of California as liberal, but the northern part of the state is quite conservative and geographic areas differ greatly in their response to COVID. Our county is a 50/50 mix,\" she says. Borenstein says she tried to counter that pushback with consistent messaging that came from a scientific or medical perspective. She was honored for her tireless efforts, steady leadership, and calming influence on the community with the 2020 Physician of the Year Award from the Central Coast Medical Association and with the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce's inaugural Community Excellence Award in 2022. Although she still has a team working on COVID response, Borenstein is grateful to have returned to normal operations over the last six months, focusing on efforts to improve community-wide health in other areas, such as opioid addiction, dementia prevention, and addressing obesity. \"For a long time, we thought health education was the most important thing to do, but I have learned that it is not sufficient,\" she says. \"You can provide information to people, but you also have to provide the environment and the social norms to make behavior change easier for people. It's not enough to say, 'eat healthy so you'll avoid adult-onset diabetes,' you have to work with schools to provide healthy lunch options. You have to locate fresh produce stores in communities that don't otherwise have access. You have to make it affordable for communities to buy the healthy options they need. Those actions make it possible for people to take the information you're providing and actually make changes in how they live.\" Celine Costello Daly, MD '84, MPH CREATING INTERNATIONAL PROTOCOLS In the 1990s, the AIDS epidemic ravaged parts of Africa and Asia. Major global efforts were launched to provide access to prevention, treatment, and care. For 25 years, Celine Costello Daly, MD '84, MPH, was on the front lines as a public health specialist in HIV/AIDS/STI and repro- ductive health, working in Malawi, India, Bhutan, Thailand, Cambodia, and other Asian countries. In various locales and capacities\u2014either as a consultant to an NGO or as a program director\u2014Dr. Daly worked with governments to set policies, train providers, secure medications, and conduct research. \"The goal was to get programs up and running and to train providers on the latest proto cols. We did research to determine the best approaches and then made adjustments based on evalu- ation of program effectiveness,\" she says. It was literally a world away from the career as a small-town doctor that Daly imagined for herself when she came to Upstate Medical University. During her family medicine residency at Middletown Hospital in Connecticut in the 1980s, she undertook a research project on prophylactic treatment for tick bites. \"It was the early Penny Borenstein, MD '88, MPH SAN LUIS OBISPO TRIBUNE16 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023days of Lyme disease,\" she recalls. \"That was my first foray into looking at the big picture and thinking about disease patterns, prevention, and optimizing treatment.\" By the time she completed her residency and began receiving job offers, she knew she wanted a different path. She was also burned out from medical school and residency and wanted time off. \"People told me I was going to ruin my career by not going directly into practice, but I didn't care. I wanted an adventure,\" she says. Daly bought an open airline ticket and traveled to Kathmandu, where she had arranged to volunteer as a doctor on a trek to Everest base camp. After that, she backpacked throughout Asia, and then connected with a nonprofit to work with Eritrean refugees in Sudan, and later, at a village health clinic in Kenya. It was there that she met the man who would become her husband, a career United Nations professional. It was clear that their life together would be spent overseas. \"Everything I was doing in Africa at that point was essen- tially as a volun teer and it was becoming obvious that I wasn't going to get paid a salary to do clinical work,\" says Daly. The couple returned to Boston for two years so Daly could earn a master's degree in public health at Harvard while her husband completed a master's in international law and diplomacy, then returned to Malawi. \"We took turns following each other for jobs,\" she says. In the early 1990s, the United States and others were heavily supporting international HIV efforts. \"From Malawi, my husband was transferred to India. Everywhere I went, I was greeted with 'You're an international AIDS specialist? We need your help,'\" Daly recalls. In those years, HIV was a death sentence, and nobody survived, she says. \"In Africa, it was rampant in the general population. But even with those very high rates, people wouldn't admit to having HIV . There was a lot of stigma and denial,\" says Daly. By contrast, in Asia, the epidemic was confined to high-risk groups: injection drug users, sex workers, and men having sex with men. \"Nearly everyone with HIV was from a marginalized group and there were a lot of structural barriers to care,\" she says. \"We worked on education, prevention, and access to testing and treatment.\" Later, the couple moved to Bangkok, Thailand, where Daly spent three years as the regional technical director for Family Health International supporting programs in 12 Asian countries. She also worked as a consultant for an innovative HIV prevention and treatment program for marginalized populations in India for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for UNAIDS to develop the national HIV strategic plan for the government of Cambodia, and as a consultant to the World Health Organization writing international guidelines for monitoring HIV in the health sector and creating global STI guidelines. After returning to the United States in 2017, she worked on a subcontract with Johns Hopkins University to assist in the devel-opment of the New York State Department of Health's HIV Clinical Resource guidelines for clinicians. Retired for two years, Daly says her career provided great rewards as well as challenges. \"It required a lot of resilience,\" she says. \"I never held a job more than three years\u2014it was a project or contract and then you move on. All of that moving around is hard on families.\" But there was never any doubt about the value of her work. Says Daly, \"everything we were doing, it didn't affect just the one person in front of you, it affected the whole country.\" Brian Harper, MD '88, MPH FIGHTING HEALTH DISPARITIES As the newly appointed vice president of diversity and inclusion at New York Institute of Technology, Brian Harper, MD '88, MPH, is helping the institution formalize efforts around diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging across its four campuses: in New York City, Old Westbury, Long Island; Jonesboro, Arkansas; and Vancouver, Canada. Dr. Harper is also chief medical officer of the university and teaches in the New York Tech College of Osteopathic Medicine, bringing a long history working in public health to counter health disparities and promote culturally competent care. \"In medicine, the more you know about a given patient and their culture, the better the rapport is, and ultimately, the better the outcomes are as well,\" he says. Celine Costello Daly, MD '84, MPH, with her husband in Bhutan in 2018 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023 17 \"The same is true for student learning in a diverse campus environment.\" A Brooklyn native, Harper studied biology and Afro- American history at Brown University before coming to Upstate for his medical education. When he was chosen by lottery to do his clinical rotations in Binghamton, he was not enthused. \"In retrospect, it really worked out to my benefit,\" he says. One of those rotations was with the Binghamton Department of Health. \"It was a great experience and gave me tremendous exposure to what a health department does and the importance of preventive health,\" he says. Harper began his internal medicine residency at Harlem Hospital at the height of the AIDS epidemic. \"There were no adequate treatments and people were dying right and left,\" he says. If patients didn't have HIV or AIDS, they were afflicted with multiple chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. \"We would treat them, and they'd get better in a hospital setting, only for them to go back to their lives, neglect their health, and return sick again. It was like a revolving door,\" he says. Harper realized he wanted to work in prevention to stop that cycle from starting in the first place. After his intern year, he moved to a two-year residency in preventive medicine at SUNY Stonybrook, which included earning his MPH at Columbia University. Harper worked as a physician at the Rikers Island Medical Unit and then became the first director of the Bureau of HIV Services at the Nassau County Department of Health. It was in that capacity that he developed a relationship with New York Tech, as a visiting lecturer at the medical school. \"During my HIV epidemiology presen- tations, I would bring patients with HIV/AIDS to talk to medical students about their experiences in healthcare settings in an effort to sensitize students to the stigma these patients faced,\" he says. Harper served as the first community co-chair for the New York State HIV Prevention Planning Committee, which provided oversight and guidance for the use of approximately $80 million in HIV Prevention funding annually from the Centers for Disease Control for New York state. In 2004, Harper became the first African American Commissioner of Health for Suffolk County. During his tenure, he managed a department of 1,500 employees with a budget of approximately $450 million and created programs including an office to address minority health inequities, a commission to find ways to curtail the HIV epidemic, and an institute to investigate long-standing public health problems in collaboration with Stony Brook University. Harper left that post and became chief operating officer and medical director of the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention, a partnership created between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and North General Hospital in Harlem with a $5 million grant from the designer Ralph Lauren. \"The program was created to provide quality cancer care to the residents of Harlem and surrounding areas, irrespective of a patient's ability to pay,\" says Harper. \"It was a great initiative, but the Center was underutilized.\" Harper developed partnerships with area churches and community organizations so that residents would feel comfortable coming in for health screenings. \"The African American community has the highest mortality rate from prostate cancer, from lung cancer, colon cancer, and breast and cervical cancer in women, so this really was a target population,\" he explains. \"We had the ability at our health center to screen for all of those diseases except for lung cancer, and if we found someone who was positive, to channel them right into Memorial Sloan Kettering for care.\" Unfortunately, the closing of North General Hospital ended the community clinic in Harlem. Harper joined New York Tech in 2012 as chief medical officer to over see the New York Tech College of Osteopathic Medi cine Academic Health Care Centers in Old Westbury and Central Islip, New York, and as associate professor of medicine. In the last few years, he's played a leading role in the university's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, helping to ensure the safe operation of New York Tech campuses as well as updating both the campus community and the public on the latest health recommendations and safety measures. And no doubt his work promoting quality health care for all informs his current efforts toward university diversity and inclusion. \"A broad and diverse array of intellectual perspectives is essential to our pursuit of excellence as an institute of higher learning,\" he says. 7 Brian Harper, MD '88, MPH 18 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023STUDENT ROUNDS External Support UPSTATE MD/PHD STUDENTS RECEIVE PRESTIGIOUS FELLOWSHIPS TO FORWARD THEIR DOCTORAL RESEARCH. In any academic environment, external grants are vital to funding research. For graduate students, the ability to secure their own funding\u2014through a grant or fellowship\u2014can signify a student's promise as an independent scientist as well as the strength of their scholarship. Upstate Medical University is no exception. Early in their doctoral program, MD/PhD students take a course in scien- tific writing steered by Leszek Kotula, MD, PhD, which includes writing a grant for submission. It's not just an academic exercise, as evidenced by two prestigious awards recently received by Upstate students. In June 2022, Akshay Patel was awarded a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Fellowship from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The fellowship funds Patel's work examining the role of the enzyme Rab4A and its association with the onset and worsening of lupus. Patel is a fourth-year PhD student in biochemistry, studying how the immune system, metabolism, and biochemistry work together in the body. At Upstate, MD/PhD students complete their first two years of medical school, followed by their doctoral work\u2014generally four years\u2014and then finish their two clinical years of medical school. Patel has conducted his doctoral research in the lab of Andras Perl, MD, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Medicine, and anticipates graduating with his dual degrees in 2025. Patel has focused on the effect lupus has on the liver, which he calls \"the most metabolically active organ in the body.\" Rab4A is increased in lupus patients. Patel is looking at how Rab4A works within cells to \"turnover mitochondria that don't work and adjust proteins on the surface of a cell,\" he says. Initially, Patel undertook an exper- iment to create model mice that don't have the Rab4A enzyme within T cells, key parts of the body's ability to fight disease, including cancer. He theorized that removing the Rab4A from T cells would help reduce the preva- lence of lupus and was surprised to find liver inflammation in the mice. \"It had just the opposite effect,\" says Patel. He applied for funding to support further investigation. While reviewers at the National Institutes of Health did not support his first application, they provided positive, specific feedback, resulting in success when he reapplied. What Patel's research has found is that the T cells without Rab4A are \"overstim-ulated,\" as if the immune response that would normally shut off that reaction is dysfunctional because of the lacking enzyme. This overstimulation might be resulting in liver damage. \"That's the last bit we're trying to solve,\" he says. Prior to Upstate, Patel attended a five-year program at Villanova University, which earned him both an undergraduate and master's degree in microbiology. Planning on attending medical school, it was a summer research program at Drexel University that convinced him to pursue an MD/PhD. \"It makes sense because my interest in becoming a physician was inspired by the things that were happening on the research side being applied clinically,\" he says. Patel was attracted to working with Dr. Perl, both for his expertise in immunology and his own reputation. MD/PhD student Akshay Patel (right), with his advisor, Andras Perl, MD, PhD UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023 19 \"I'm his seventh MD/PhD student and he's an excellent mentor,\" Patel says. \"The lab also has a lot of resources, with techni- cians, postdocs, and other graduate students.\" Patel plans to apply to residency in internal medicine through the Physician Scientist Training Program, thinking he may ultimately pursue gastroenterology. Like his mentor Perl, he plans on an academic career, combining clinical practice with his own research lab. \"The possibilities are endless for what I'd like to study in 15 years, which is probably when I'll be setting up my lab,\" he says. \"I have a lot of interests to delve deeper into what I want to study for a career.\" When MD/PhD student Gargi Mishra joined the lab of Xin Jie Chen, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, her plan was to study mitochon- drial function using a mouse model developed in a lab at the University of Connecticut. But the pandemic created issues generating the mouse model, forcing Mishra to switch to a more mechanistic basic science project using yeast. The change in methodology brought unexpected benefits. \"I found that I was able to do a lot more genetics and biochemistry and that I enjoyed exploring new biology in a way that I wouldn't have been able to in a mouse model,\" she says. Mishra's research focuses on the dysfunction of mitochondria in cells and the possible contributions to heart disease. In January, she was awarded a two-year American Heart Association (AHA) Predoctoral Fellowship to help fund her work. Mishra's proposal was highly ranked by the AHA (0.14 percentile), which she views as an endorsement of the impor- tance of basic science research. \"Following the science can lead to discoveries of unexpected connections to real-world problems,\" she says. Mitochondria are essentially hubs in a cell that help provide energy and other resources for the cell to function. \"They're especially important in tissues that are undergoing high metabolic turnover and expending a lot of energy, which is why they're extremely relevant to the heart,\" she says. \"You need healthy mitochondria for healthy heart cells.\" Mitochondria require about 1,500 different proteins to function. \"If import is halted, perhaps by a protein getting clogged in a transport channel, mito - chon dria cannot function properly,\" Mishra explains. She compares the phen ome non to food debris that accu - m ulates in a clogged sink drain. Mishra is using yeast to mimic the process to determine how mitochondria can either degrade or compartmentalize those accumulated proteins. She's hoping a better understanding of the basic science behind mitochondrial dys func tion can lead to future drug and therapeutic discoveries. \"While there are many drugs that treat heart disease, very few target mitochondrial function in the heart,\" she says. An international student from India, Mishra studied biochemistry at Mount Holyoke College, then spent a year conduct ing research on cancer immunology at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, before coming to Upstate. Although she initially thought she would pursue cancer research, she chose a rotation in Dr. Chen's lab at the suggestion of MD/PhD student Liam Coyne '23. \"I could feel right away that this would be a good environment for me,\" she says. \"There have been some curve balls, but the support and mentorship I have received have been invaluable. Developing this grant really was a team effort, and I am grateful to my advisor, Dr. Chen, for innumerable discussions, and my outside reader, Dr. Steven D. Hanes, emeritus professor of Biochem- istry, who provided insightful critiques for my proposal.\" Mishra is planning a career in academic medicine, with current interests focused on either neurology or physical medicine and rehabilitation. \"I do want a significant portion of my career to be focused on research,\" she says. \"I really enjoy basic biology, asking questions in the lab and trying to figure out mechanisms of disease, which can eventually lead to better health outcomes.\"Gargi Mishra, an MD/PhD student in the lab with her adviser, Professor Xin Jie Chen, PhD 20 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023CLASS NOTES 1953 October 1314, 2023October 1314, 2023 1955 Ronald H.

Of course, we should consider the time of day and schedule when Julian Aroesty would not be riding his bike multi- miles or writing short touching essays on life.\" 1963 October 1314, 2023 Bernard W. Asher and Lillian have recently moved from Batavia, NY, to the Kendal at Ithaca retirement community, located adja- cent to the Cornell campus. \"We can highly recommend this place. It is filled mostly with Cornellians,\" he writes. \"We welcome visitors.\"GEORGE B. JACOBS, MD '58 Pioneering Spine Surgeon When George B. Jacobs, MD '58, began his career as a neurosurgeon in the 1960s, the field was very small. \"Today, there are probably 3,500 members of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, but the AANS did not exist at the time. The Harvey Cushing Society (named for a founding father of neu- rosurgery) had about 350 members and you had to be invited to join,\" he recalls. Dr. Jacobs helped pioneer the field of spine surgery, which was a perfect amalgam of his interests. An engineering student as an undergraduate at New York University, Jacobs came to the Norton College of Medicine thinking he'd pursue orthopedics. \"I liked structure and problem solving,\" he says. In his first year of medical school, he had an infec - tion and became systemically ill. \"I was treated with the new 'wonder' drug penicillin,\" he says. Nonetheless, he got sicker and sicker. When his father, a cardiologist, came to see him, he immediately asked the doctors to stop the penicillin. \"No one appreciated the systemic effects of penicillin allergy at that time,\" he says. Jacobs got better, but he had missed a great deal of course material. He buckled down and made up most of it, then found a summer course at the University of Michigan to take histology. Knowing that Jacobs would have a lot of downtime, his anatomy professor reached out to a colleague at Michigan and got Jacobs a part- time job in the neuroanatomy lab. \"That focused my interests in a new direction,\" he says. Jacobs did his residency in neurological surgery at the Montefiore Medical Center at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, working under world-famous neurosurgeon Leo Davidoff, MD, and then joined the faculty of Markland College of Medicine, at the time the only medical school in New Jersey. Shortly after, he was recruited to the faculty at Einstein, where he would remain for 20 years (minus a two-year stint at the University of Pittsburgh as chair of spine surgery to help them keep accreditation). He attained the rank of professor at both Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the University of Pittsburgh, developing his own skills and technique as a spine sur - geon and teaching others to help grow the field. He became a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, a Fellow of the Scoliosis Research Society, and a Fellow of the International College of Surgeons. Lillian and Bernard W. Asher '63 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023 21 CLASS NOTES In the 1990s, Jacobs became professor and chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery at Rutgers University New Jersey Medical School, the Hackensack University Medical Center Division. He retired from that position in 2012, wanting to clear the opportunity for one of his for - mer residents to become chair, joining a large orthopedic practice as a spine surgeon. Concurrent with Jacobs building his own career, his wife, Rosanne Wille-Jacobs, had served as dean of the College of Nursing and Health Care Professions and pro- vost and senior vice president of Lehman College City University of New York. When she retired, the couple decided to relocate to Florida. \"I was ready to do something else,\" Jacobs recalls. Retirement lasted two months. Jacobs joined the Bay Pines VA Healthcare System as a senior consultant in spine neurosurgery, a part-time post he held for six years, into his late 80s. Now 90, Jacobs remains active on committees of various spine societies and serves on the editorial board of the spine section of Surgical Neurology International. He also serves on the architectural review board and board of directors of his community in Fort Myers. An Airline Transport-rated pilot, he believes he's the oldest flight instructor in the country still certified. Jacobs current passion is training his new rescue dog, a four-year-old German shepherd, Thor III. \"We adopted him two months ago, and you'd never know he's a res- cue, he's a completely different dog,\" he says. A native of Switzerland, Jacobs grew up with German shepherds, which he says are a misunderstood breed. \"They're not easy dogs; they're demanding. But if you have a good German shepherd, you never want another breed.\" Through the years, the Jacobs have had a number of German shepherds, and at one time his wife bred dogs for show. Jacobs describes their last dog, Thor II, as a once-in-a-lifetime dog. \"He was a huge, oversize dog, but incredibly gentle and the smartest dog you've ever seen. He worked independently as a service and therapy dog, and he befriended all the animals that came to our yard: coyotes, raccoons, even a white river rat.\" Devastated by the dog's passing, the Jacobs chose an older rescue based on their own age. \"We didn't want a puppy that would outlive us,\" he says. Looking back on a very full life, Jacobs is proud of the cadre of spine surgeons he's trained, now in leading posi- tions across the country. \"That gives me an incredible amount of satisfaction,\" he says. \"You can't accomplish much more in your lifetime than to educate young people.\" \u2014Ren\u00e9e Gearthart LevyRosanne and George Jacobs '58 with their German shepherd rescue, Thor III 22 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023CLASS NOTES J.

UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023 27 CLASS NOTES JACLYN SISSKIND, MD '09 The Doctor Who Prescribes Books Upstate Golisano pediatrician Jaclyn Sisskind, MD '09, doles out prescriptions at every office visit, using her special pad that's always in her pocket. But she's not dispensing pills to chew or liquids to swallow. Instead of the pharmacy, she sends patients to the library. For Sisskind, the pages of a book are perhaps the most impor - tant tool in her medical bag. She uses them as a diagnostic tool to check developmental milestones of babies, the social-emotional intelligence of toddlers, and to help teens find their bearings. What grew from her own passion for reading and her desire to connect with patients has grown into a whole new identity for her. Now known as the \"Readiatrician,\" Sisskind has her own web- site (readiatrician.com), 15,000 followers on Twitter, and a monthly virtual book club for local pediatricians. She has connected with authors, been asked to speak at reading conferences, and has written blog posts about her experiences, including a January 3 piece published in the School Library Journal, the premiere publication for librarians and information specialists who work with children and teens. \"I always ask kids what they're reading because it's an impor - tant question. And when a doctor asks them something it makes them realize this is something they should be doing,\" she says. \"It also makes the caregiver realize, 'Wow this is important enough that the doctor is asking about it.'\" Prescribing books started causally about nine years ago. Sisskind carries Post-it notes in her pockets and she started jot - ting down titles of books she thought her patients would enjoy. When she realized how powerful that could be, she created her reading prescription pad and applied for grants to supply books for young readers. Since most grants only cover early readers, her book supply only covers patients from babies through age five, and each receives a book at their well-child visit. Sisskind's office, the Baldwinsville location of Upstate Pediatrics, is in the process of becoming a Reach Out and Read site. Reach Out and Read is a national program that provides grant money for books for young patients. Sisskind shows parents of babies and toddlers that books can be used for so much more than reading. She uses board books to check milestones like passing an object from hand to hand, identi- fying colors, counting, and even just using them to make noise or toss around. She gives older patients recommendations, hoping they will find the book at their local or school library.Using books with her teen population is perhaps her most pro- found use of books. Sisskind uses books to build trust with patients and to help them with physical, emotional, and psychological well- being. She recounts an episode with a patient she met as a teen, who had faced medical issues since birth. Sisskind struggled to connect with the patient and even conducted some appointments through the office door. Nothing worked to build trust until she saw a book poking out of the patient's bag. She knew the book and started to talk with the patient about it. Everything changed from that moment, and now the patient is a thriving college student. Whatever the issue\u2014sexual identity, bullying, body image, loss of a parent, racism, fitting in\u2014Sisskind always has a book at the ready to help patients see they are not alone. Sometimes she just recommends a funny book that she and the patient can laugh about together. A huge fan of children's and young adult literature, Sisskind can easily recall relevant texts from the books she is reading or ones she read as a kid. \"My brain tends to hang on to that information,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have to look up the Krebs cycle so often if I could have memorized that in medical school. But I can recall lines and titles and themes and authors. It is just the way my brain is wired.\" Sisskind says she always has a book with her and reads during lunch, with her three boys, who are in eighth grade, fourth grade and kindergarten, and before bed. \"I need to read in the same way some people need to exercise,\" she says. \"I wish I had the relationship with my treadmill that I have with books. I am a happier person when I am reading.\" \u2014Jean AlbaneseUpstate Golisano's Jaclyn Sisskind '09 is known as the \"Readiatrician,\" for prescribing books and trips to the library for her patients. 28 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | SPRING 2023CLASS NOTES Mark A.

Dr. Collins completed her pediatric residency at Bellevue Hospital and Syracuse Memorial Hospital and then joined the Army. She worked as a pediatri- cian in hospitals abroad and in the United States for 20 years. In Land- stuhl, Germany, she was chief of pediatrics and the pediatric consul- tant to the surgeon general of the U.S. Army in Europe. In 1968, she was assigned to William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, where she retired. Collins reached the rank of Colonel, and in 1959, was a charter member of the AAP Section on Military Pediatrics, now the Uniformed Services. Collins was survived by her stepdaughter, Carolyn Wood; stepson William A. Collins III; five grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. 1946 JAMES J. NORTON , of Montour Falls, NY, died February 13 at age 100. He was a country kid and country doctor. He added surgeon, family practitioner, and lifelong community volunteer. He always said he practiced in the Golden Age of medicine, witnessing un believable advances in medicine and technology and whole diseases eradicated during the course of his career. Being a doctor and an inte- gral part of the community meant the world to him. Dr. Norton served in the Army in occupied Japan, where he honed his surgical skills as captain post-World War II. He and his wife, Marjorie Norton '49, moved to Montour Falls, where they were instrumental in the develop- ment of a new Schuyler hospital. He was directly responsible for the construction of the 14A bypass over Route 14, north of Watkins Glen, after a series of accidents were ignored. He and his family hosted fourth-year medical students in a rural health rotation. The Nortons traveled to Yugoslavia as part of a medical advisory team, and he vol- unteered in many other capacities. He also served as coroner for years. After retirement, Norton volun- teered twice at the Rosebud Indian Reservation. He served on many boards and committees, including Elmira Psychiatric Center, Finger Lakes Health Systems Agency Mental Health Committee, NY- Penn American Red Cross Blood Services, and many others.
