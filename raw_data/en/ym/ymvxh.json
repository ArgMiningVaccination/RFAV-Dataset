The WHO estimates that 100 million Europeans are using traditional and alternative medicines, one fifth of them regularly.1 The EU CAMbrella project estimated that between 10 and 50 percent of the E U population is using CAM. It also there are more than 150,000 registered medical doctors (MDs) with additional CAM certification and more than 180,000 registered and certified non-medical CAM practitioners.2 Despite their growing popularity; CAM is contr oversial amongst healthcare professionals, the scientific community, and policy makers . Opponents insist there is no scientifically valid evidence that they are effective, and that complementary therapies are based on pseudo -scientific models. Supporters a nd practitioners of CAM argue that there is compelling anecdotal evidence from patients that many treatments work, and stress that it can coexist with standard medicine and complement it. It is also increasingly debated at EU level. Interest in this topic was mostly raised through the FP7 projects EU CAMbrella that looked at regulation of CAM within the European Union and at attitudes of citizens towards CAM in Europe.3 The project aimed at establishing a roadmap for future CAM research in the EU . Several c onferences focusing on CAM have taken place among which the EPHA conference on \" Complementary and Alternative Medicine - Innovation and Added Value for European Healthcare \". Organisations are also established at EU level to advocate for these types of therapies, including for example the Association of Natural Medicine in Europe (ANME) the Europea n Coalition on Homeopathic and Anthroposophic Medicinal Products (ECHAMP), the European Forum for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (EFCAM) and other groups representing various CAM practitioners or suppliers . In 2010 an Interest Group of MEP s on Complementary and Alternative Medicine was launched within the European Parliament. The European Patients' Forum believe that is important to communicate the p atients' perspective on this theme at EU level to ensure that patients with chronic and or long term conditions , who are users of CAM therapies, have their voice taken into account in the debate that is arising. The aim of this paper is to give a clear ove rview of the issue to patient organisations . Its objective is to support internal discussions, in order to adopt an EPF position in the future . The last s ection of this paper is a discussion section raising some essential questions for EPF membe rs' to refl ect on regarding CAM therapies . 1.2 WHAT IS COMPLEM ENTARY AND ALTERNATI VE MEDICINE ? A simple definition of complementary and alternative medicines is that they are \" medical products and practices that are not part of standard care. Standard care is what medica l doctors, doctors of osteopathy, and allied health professionals, such as nurses and physical therapists, practice. \"4 1 WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014 -2023, World Health organisation, 2013 http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/92455/1/9789241506090_eng.pdf 2 http://www.cambre lla.eu/aduploads/cambrellapolicybrief.pdf 3 For more information and deliverables, please see the projects' website: http://www.cambrella.eu/home.php 4 Definition of the National Centre for Complementary an d Alternative Medicine (U.S) http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/complementaryandalternativemedicine.html 4 Complementary and Alternative Medicine - European Patients' Forum Briefing Paper However as complementary and alternative medicines are defined as what is not considered as part of standard care, it is an evolving and broad category that may change over time . A treatment previously considered CAM can increasingly become part of standard medical culture. It also happens that a treatment may be considered standard for one condition and CAM for another disease. Evidence of efficacy or absence of evidence base are not criterion that define this category of treatment either, as some CAM treatment may be approved and have undergone randomized clinical trials, and a few standard medicines don't necessarily have significant e vidence of benefit according to the Cochrane collaboration.5 Treatments provided by CAM practitioners (e.g. homeopathic doctors, herbalists) are generally considered as CAM. A functional definition was put in place by the Cochrane review to determine wheth er a therapy is considered as CAM or \"conventional\" medicine: \"Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) is a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture [...] CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well-being . Boundari es within CAM and between the CAM domain and that of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed.\"6 Below, you can find a non-exhaustive list7 that give s example of the most common types of complementa ry and a lternative medicines . Categories8 Examples Mind-Body medicine Hypnosis , meditation, relaxation and visualisation, Tai Chi... Natural product based therapies Aromatherapy, nutritional therapy (including diets, and nutritional supplements), herbal remedies... Manipulative and body based practices Shiatsu, chiropractic, osteopathy , reflexology... Energy medicine Acupuncture, Reiki ... Whole medical systems Ayurveda, Chinese Traditional Medicine, Naturopathy, Homeopathy ... Because it is defined in contradiction to standard care, CAM practitioners and supplier s refer to non CAM, mainstream medicine as \"conventional\" \"allopathic\" or \"dominant\". These terms are controverted amongst CAM opponents however. CAM industry: ECHAMP the European Association for Homeopathy and Antroposophic Medic ine reunites 50 companies.

They are not mutually exclusive. A more comprehensive list can be found at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3196853/#!po=75.0000 5 Complementary and Alternative Medicine - European Patients' Forum Briefing Paper medicinal products was valued at \u20ac1.035 billion. These products account for 0.7% of the European pharmaceutical market. According to ECHAMP they employ about 8000 pe ople in the EU.9 In addition to this, CAM products c an be imported (e.g. ayurveda, c hinese traditional medicine) or prepared directly by a practitioner for the individual patients. Globally this industry is estimated to be $60 billion a year (approximately 44 billion euros)10. Regulation of complementary and alternative medicines means both regulation of the products (with a common framework at EU level for herbal medicinal products and homeopathy) and regulation o f the practitioners to ensure patient safety and quality of care which is national. 2.1 IN MEMBER STATES There are divergences across the EU on the use of complementary and alternative medicines. In particular some forms of CAM are more used in some Member Sta tes than other, or/and more accepted by medical practitioners and healthcare services. This leads to divergence across Member States that were highlighted in the CAMbrella research project. A few country examples that demonstrates the diversity of approac h towards CAM therapies: In the United Kingdom, most established disciplines include osteopathy, chiropractic, homeopathy, acupuncture and herbal medicine. There is no statutory regulation for most CAM professions, except for chiropractors and osteopaths, which where regulated to ensure patients' safety.11 The NHS provides information on CAM to the public, and to practitioners. NICE, the health and technology assessment agency, has issued several clinical guidelines for the use of certain therapies in speci fic conditions. The UK is the only European country with public sector CAM hospitals. In France, the most popular forms of complementary/alternative medicine s are homeopathy, acupuncture, herbal medic ines, water cures, chiropractic , and according to a surv ey CAM could be used by up to 49 percent of the population. CAM is in large part provided by mainstream healthcare professionals due to the Code of Public Health that declares it is illegal for other people than physician to perform medical procedures, yet there are in practice CAM practi tioners with no qualification in medicine. In Hungary CAM legislation is integrated in the public health system and all CAM providers must be a part of the official health system. The legislation covers an important number of CAM practices, CAM physicians and practitioners must have a licence to practise and non -medical practitioners have to be official registered members of the public health system.12 9 http://www.echamp.eu/about -echamp/who -are-we.html 10 \"There is \"Legal status and r egulation of CAM in Europe. Part I - CAM regulations in the European countries\" https://fedora.phaidra.univie.ac.at/fedora/get/o:291583/bdef:Content/get 6 Complementary and Alternative Medicine - European Patients' Forum Briefing Paper More information on CAM regulation in Member States can be found in the WH O report from 200513 or in the CAMbrella project report14. Across the EU 28 , several countries have general CAM laws either separate or within their healthcare medicine legislation (Belgium, Germany Portugal, Denmark, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta, Bulgaria, Roma nia), other have legislations in some specific CAM areas ((Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia) , Ireland and Croatiaa no specific CAM regulation.15 2.2 AT EU LEVEL: HOMEOPA THY AND HERBAL MEDIC INE PRODUCT S Herbal products An herbal medicinal product is a ny medicinal product, exclusively containing as active ingredients one or more herbal substances or one or more herbal preparations, or the combination of both. 16 Before 2004 h erbal products were regulated unevenly across the E U, with some countries usually regulating them as food products, other as medicines, and another group with a specific legislation for traditional medicines. Several safety issues involving an herbal product sold across Member States have demonstrated the need for harmonisation of rules at EU level.17 Even a long tradition does not exclude the possibility that there may be concerns with regard to the product's safety . The EU regulation of herbal medicinal products also applies to anthroposophic, traditional chinese and a yurvedic medicinal products, not in form of injection and not containing other ingredients than herbals . For these products there are 3 different routes to obtain a marketing authorisation according to Directive 2001/8 3/EC on medicine for huma n use and its modifying Directive 2004/24/EC also known as the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive : Traditional use : A product can be classified under traditi onal medicinal use provisions accepted on the basis of sufficient safety data and p lausible efficacy: the product is granted a traditional use registration by a Member State. The assessment is mostly on the basis of safety and efficacy bibliographic data. Manufacturers have to provide data showing 30 years of safe use including 15 within the EU. Well -established use: This is demonstrated with the provision of scientific literature showing that the active substances of the medicinal products have been in well -established medicinal use within the Union for at least ten years, with recognised efficacy and a n acceptable level of safety for a product to be granted a marketing authorisation . Marketing authorisation: a product can be authorised after evaluation of a marketing authorisation application consisting of only safety and effica cy data from the company's own 13 http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js7916e/#Js7916e 14 Solveig Wiesener et al \"Legal status and regulation of CAM in Europe.

The Lancet, \"strengthening the regulation of herbal medicines in Europe, Volume 377, Issue 9776, Page 1466, 30 April 2011 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140 -6736(11)60583 -7/fulltext 7 Complementary and Alternative Medicine - European Patients' Forum Briefing Paper development (' stand -alone ') or a combination of own studies and bibliographic data ('mixed application'). As a result the product is granted a marketing authorisation.18 These 3 procedures are simplified compared to the market ing authorisation for medicinal products, as no clinical trial is a required. The EU l egislation also established the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) in the European Medicines' Agency . It is composed of specialists from each EU Member States (1 permanent and 1 alternate) of herbal medicines, as well as a few co -opted experts in other relevant area ( e.g. paediatric, toxicology ). Its role is to provide EU Member States and European institutions its scientific opinion on questions relating to her bal medicinal products. Other core tasks include the establishment of a draft 'Community list of herbal substances, preparations and combinations thereof for use in traditional herbal medicinal products', as well as the establishment of Community herbal mo nographs19. No patients or consumers are involved within this committee. The Directive doesn't cover medicinal products formulated \" in accordance with the specifications of an authorized health -care professional and for u se by an individual patient under hi s direct personal responsibility \" which means that authorized healthcare professionals can supply individual patients with herba l and homeopathic medicinal products. While the EU legislation was criticized by some campaigners as \"putting a ban\" on herbal medicines, it was adopted for public health purpose. 20 However it may affect access to some products that cannot meet the Directive requirement and as result patients may choose to purchase the product from unregulated sources such as internet. 21 It is fully implemented since 2011. Homeopathy Homeopathy is a system of complementary medicine in which ailments are treated by minute doses of natural substances that in larger amounts would produce symptoms of the ailment. At EU level, homeopathic pro ducts are regulated by the Directive 2001/83/EC There are two routes to obtain authorisation for a homeopathic product : A simplified registration procedure for products that are administered orally or externally, which have no specific therapeutic indication on the label , and that are sufficiently diluted. Safety and quality of the product has to be demonstrated , but there is no efficacy proof demanded, and the product cannot make a medical claim . They can benefit from mutual recognition The national registration procedure : the requirements for quality and safety of the product are as outlined in the directive, but Member States can retain their own rules for preclinical tests or clinical trials. 18 http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/general/general_content_000208.jsp# 19 \"A monograph contains the view of the HMPC on all information necessary for the use of a medicinal product containing the herbal substance or preparations described in the monograph: what the herbal product is used for; who the herbal product is intended for; safety information such as information regarding undesirable effects and interactions with other medicines.\" http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/document_listing/document_listing_000212.jsp&mid= WC0b01ac058003380a 20 Euractiv \"EU herbal medicine law set for legal challenge\" 29 March 2011 al http://www.euractiv.com/health/eu -herbal - medici nes-law-set-lega-news -503563 21 The Lancet, \"strengthening the regulation of herbal medicines in Europe, Volume 377, Issue 9776, Page 1466, 30 April 2011 http ://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140 -6736(11)60583 -7/fulltext 8 Complementary and Alternative Medicine - European Patients' Forum Briefing Paper While the Directive gives a common framework harmonizing certain aspects across the EU to ensure a minimum level of safety , regulation of homeopathy is still mostly done at national level. 2.3 OTHER ROUTES: HEALTH CLAIMS UNDER FOOD RE GULATION, AND MEDICAL PURPOSES UND ER MEDICAL DEVICES D IRECTIVE Botanica l products (that are not medicinal) are regu lated under the food legislation . It has to comply with the general requirements set out in the Regulation(EC) No 178/2002 laying down general principles and requirements of food law and creating the European Foo d Safety Authority (EFSA) It also has to comply with the Regulation(EC) 1926/2004 on Nutrition and Health claims. The EFSA has published guidance to assess the safety of botanicals. So far it has not examined health claims by botanical products. In 2012, a capsule based on cranberry also managed to have a medical purpose recognised through obtaining certification as a medical device.22 2.4 IN THE U NITED STATES OF AMERICA Homeopathic remedies are regulated as drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). However, FDA does not evaluate the remedies for safety or effectiveness. It allows homeopathic remedies that meet certain conditions to be marketed without preapproval. Homeopathic remedies must contain active ingredients that are listed in the Home opathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS). In addition, the FDA requires that the label on the product, include at least one major indication (i.e., medical problem to be treated), a list of ingredients, the number of times the active ingredient was diluted, and directions for use. If a homeopathic remedy c laims to treat a serious disease (e.g. cancer) , can only be sold on prescrption . Only produc ts for minor health problems can be sold without a prescription.23 Herbal products may be regulated as dru g or as dietary products according to their intended purpose and claims.24 The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) regulates products intended to supplement the diet\" that contain vitamins, minerals, herbs, or othe r botanicals, amino acids. Under this act, there are requirements to show the product is reasonably safe, but no efficacy requirements, and less stringent post marketing control than for medicines, including over -the- counter medicines. Since 1998, the U.S also has a National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) . The mission of NCCAM is to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of complementary and alternative medicine interventions and their roles i n improving health and health care. Under the current strategic plan running until 2015, it has 5 objectives: Advance research on mind and body interventions, practices, and disciplines. Advance research on CAM natural products. 22 Medical Brands Announces the First use of Medical Claims in the OTC for Treating and Preventing Urinary Tract Infections\" , Reuters ,1st May opathy 24 http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/98fr/06d 9 Complementary and Alternative Medicine - European Patients' Forum Briefing Paper Increase understanding of \" real world\" patterns and outcomes of CAM use and its integration into health care and health promotion. Improve the capacity of the field to carry out rigorous research. Develop and disseminate objective, evidence -based information on CAM intervention.25 The NCCAM grants funds for research on CAM and also conduct its own research. 2.5 WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION STRATEGY The World Health Organisation has long been active on the question of traditional and complementary medicines. In 2013, it adopted a new multiann ual strategy (2014 -2023) for traditional medicines. The objectives of this new strategy are as follow: 1. Build the knowledge base that will allow Traditional &Complementary Medicine s to be managed actively through appropriate national policies that unders tand and recognize the role and potential of these medicines. 2. S trengthen the quality assurance, safety, p roper use and effectiveness of Traditional & Complementary Medicines by regulating products, practices and practitioners through education and train ing, skills development, services and therapies. 3. Promote universal health coverage by integrating Traditional &Complementary Medicines services into health service delivery and self -health care by c apitalizing on their potential contribution to improve health servic es and health outcomes, and by ensuring users are able to make informed choices about self -health car e. The WHO makes recommendations on actions for the Organisation, the Member States, and stakeholders in order to achieve these ob jectives.26 In addition, it recognises the potential of this type of medicine in the management of chronic diseases and for prevention.27 3.1 SAFETY & EFFICACY OF CAM There is a crucial issue as regard the evidence base for the safety and efficacy of complementary and alternative therapies. While research is increasing and the Cochrane Library lists over 4000 randomised trials, there is still little research compared to conventional medicine.28 Many studies are reportedly flawed, due to the size of the trial with often insufficient statistical significance, variable or inconsistent result s due to poor control, and inadequate study design (e.g. lack of comparator such as a placebo or another treatment). In addition for certain form of 25 http://nccam.nih.gov/about/ataglance 26 WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014 -2023, World Health organisation, 2013 http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/92455/1/9789241506090_eng.pdf 27 Ibid, p11; 16 28 Catherine Zollman , Andrew Vickers \"What is Complementary Medicine?\" British Medical Journal volume 319 11 September 1999, p693 10 Complementary and Alternative Medicine - European Patients' Forum Briefing Paper medicines it is difficult to conduct a randomized clinical trials, (e.g. to find an adequate placebo for acupuncture or chiropractic acts).29 There are multiple factors that contribute to this gap. Funding for complementary medicine research is scarce, though some programmes are increasingly open to fund such research, practitioners in this field lack access to academic infrastructure, and may have less focus on research skills during their training. Difficulties to find trial participants with the same condition may also be more important in this field as practitioners have no disease specialty. 30 Supporters and practitioners of CAM sometimes also argue that randomized clinical trials are not suited to test their discipline, given their individualized approach, and they also raise that endpoints measured in clinical studies for conventional medicine do not match for CAM. Instead they prefer to base their study on observation of effectiveness. Some studies show effects of CAM treatment s - e.g. acupuncture increases the level of endorphin. But effect is different from measuring the effectiveness of a treatment. And even observed effectiveness is different from clinical effectiveness as the placebo effect and natural course of the disease can also lead to misleading conclusions. 31 The WHO un derlines in its strategy that \"W hile there is much to be learned fr om controlled clinical trials, other evalua tion methods are also valuable . \"32 These include for example outcome and effectiveness studies, as well as comparative effectiveness research , qualitative methods , or well- designed observational studies. It also published guidelines on methodologies for research and evaluation of traditiona l medicines.33 However, some studies have show n it is possible to demonstrate efficacy of a CAM treatment through clinical trials. Peer reviewed studies can be found on PLOS medicine, as well as the Cochrane collaboration.34 NCCAM -funded research is also ava ilable on Pubmed. 35 For example some reviews and studies have demonstrated the benefits of acupuncture in the treatment of certain type of pains.36 Some other form of CAM treatments have little supporting evidence, despite rigorous research, this is the ca se for example for homeopathy.37 A committee of the H ouse of common in the UK in 2009 -2010 recommended stopping research in this field, an d raised a crucial issue in taking political decisions as regards funding CAM research: it is unethical to enter patien ts in trials over a question that has been already settled.38 29 Richard L Nahin, Stephen E Straus, \"Research into complementary and alternative medicine: problems and potential\" British Medical Journal volume 322 20 January 2011 pp161 -163 30 ibid 31 E.

The placebo effect is often explained as the result of positive expectation, bel ief, or hope in patients derived from the clinical encounte r\".40 This effect has been discovered in the 1950s' and have since become a common feature in clinical trials, were groups of patients testing a new medicine are compared to a group of patients receiving a placebo, rather than no treatment. The placebo effect i s a complex mechanism, and is a subject of research of its own . Providing a placebo means deceiving the patients therefore it also poses ethical issues. As regards CAM for which there is little evidence, it is possible that the placebo effect comes into play. Some researchers argue that some features of CAM contribute to maximize the placebo effect of these therapies. This includes the whole person approach, and the different patient/practitioner relationship . However, even if patients feel better thanks to the placebo effect, they may be missing out on better treatments for their condition, or they may later use CAM for a condition that would be better treated with conventional medicine. 41 When using a placebo, some patients experience what is called the no cebo effect, which means they report adverse reaction s. This effect has been used by some researchers to explain the \"aggravation\" mechanism in homeopathy, whereby patients experience new symptoms before getting better . They argue that this phenomenon is i n fact due to the nocebo effect .42 3.3 RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CAM There is a common misconception about CAM treatment that they are natural and therefore safer than other types of treatment. However there have been multiple cases of adverse reactions or event du e to CAM that contradict this common belief. This ranges from serious reactions and death after chiropractic manipulations, to renal failure due to a wrong preparation of a Chinese traditional medicine, and the Kava, a plant traditionally used to sooth anx iety and provoke sleep has been reported to provoke renal failure, infections due to acupuncture needles.43 In addition to this, CAM also poses risk in that it may lead patients to stop treatment with conventional therapies, or to delay seeking such treat ment. There was recent case in Canada of a child treated by CAM remedies that died due to a treatable infection and several cases where death 39 \"Think Yourself better\" The Economist ,May 19th 2011 retrieved at http://www.economist.com/node/18710090 40Jon C Tilburt , Ezekiel J Emanuel et al \"Prescribing \"placebo treatments\": results of national survey of US internists -bad-science 43Simon Singh\" Beware the spinal 19 April 2008 http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/19/controversiesinscience -health Maurie Markman \" Safety issues in using complementary and alternative medicine \" Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 20, No 18s (September the regulation of herbal medicines in Europe, Volume 377, Issue 9776, Page 1466, 30 April 2011 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140 -6736(11)60583 -7/ful ltext 12 Complementary and Alternative Medicine - European Patients' Forum Briefing Paper was caused by failure to seek conventional medicine by the BBC in Australia.44 Steve Jobs , former Apple CEO, delaye d the recommended procedure for his pancreatic cancer and thereafter reportedly expressed regret over this decision .45 However, evidence shows that most patients usually go to their general practitioners before using CAM. CAM therapies are increasingly deemed complementary with conventional medicine yet there are evidence for certain product that taken in combination it can alter the effectiveness of the treatment e.g. some therapies have been shown to have interactions wit h anaesthetic product s. In addition, for many CAM products, interactions with standard treatments are little studied. CAM products are also a common target for counterfeiter of medicines.46 3.4 BENEFIT S OF CAM Users of complementary medicines report high level of satisfactions with their treatment, about 80 percent. 47 Amongst key factor s the quality of the patient professional interaction is often cited , with more time available, continuity of care from the same professional, non-institutional setting as important features of CAM , particularly for patients with chronic conditions and for patients with non-defined illnesses . Individualised treatment, taking into account the whole person, addressing of psycho -socia l aspects of the disease, also contribute to the positive perception of this type of medicine. Alternative medicine also put the emphasis on low tech intervention, and on prevention and well -being .48It has also been pointed out that patients see that kind o f healthcare as more \"empowering\" and less authoritarian.49 CAM can be provided by standard healthcare professionals, or by practitioners of CAM. Practitioners that only provide CAM may operate outside of medical licencing law, they are mostly private practitioners , with training in private schools or different university compared to conventional healthcare professionals . There are some voluntary bodies that self-regulate certain professions, but joining them is not mandator y for practitioners of a given professions. In Finland osteopaths chiropractors and naprapaths have to be registered. . Another potential issue to look at besides registration is the code of conducts for CAM practitioners. The Independent reported that acco rding to a review of these codes, none are bound to an obligation to report adverse event. In many EU Member States , CAM is also largely provided by conventional healthcare providers . This is for example the case in France, and in Germany, Austria. In certain countries the practice of 44 http://www.nhs.uk/news/2010/12December/Pages/alternative -medicine -danger -for-children.aspx 45John Swaine \" Steve Jobs 'regretted trying to beat cancer with alternative medicine for so long' \", the Telegraph , Zollman, Andrew Vickers \"Complementary medicine and the patient\" British Medical Journal , volume 319 , 4 december 1999 48 ibid 49 John A.

For these countries there are courses and diplomas in seve ral CAM disciplines for physicians , and teaching and practice of CAM is allowed for conventional healthcare providers. Several examples illustrate the diversity of situations as to a CAM profession in the EU. For acupuncture, in half the countries studied by the CAMbrella project , only doctors may provide acupuncture treatment. But in man y other countries there is an acupuncture regulation and it is then provided by either CAM or regulated healthcare professionals. Sometimes regulation is left to the profe ssional associations. The CAMbrella project has mapped the situation for the main forms of CAM therapies. 5.1 WHY PATIENTS USE CAM Several studies have looked at reasons for which patients decide to use complem entary and alternative medicine. The main reason is dissatisfaction, disappointment with medical professionals (e.g. the doctor didn't understand, or didn't take time or didn't seem interested in the problem ), or with medicinal products (e.g. adverse reactions or fear of potential side ef fects, preference for natural method ). It is also often on the advice of friends or relatives. One important issue raised in several studies is that patients rarely disclose their use of complemen tary therapies to their doctors. There is an important gap in knowledge as regards the conditions for which patients most commonly use CAM, however U.S. studies suggests that patients with chronic conditions are a factor in the use of CAM.50 The NCCAM suggest that people sick CAM treatment for musculoskeletal conditions the most.51 Other diseases include gastrointestinal conditions, respiratory diseases, and psychological conditions. 52 5.2 ACCESS TO CAM Several studies acknowledge that CAM is of ten private care, at the patients' own exp ense. For this reason CAM users in industrialised countries tend to be among citizens who have completed higher education and are better -off financially.53 Out of pocket payments of CAM treatment by patients seem to be the norm in many countries according to the CAMbrella project : This includes for example Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Slovenia. In Belgium and Ireland CAM is not covered by the health insurance but several private insurance funds includ e CAM practices in their voluntary health insurance. However in the European Union, it is also frequent to see some forms of CAMs , or some part of the CAM therapies reimbursed. In Denmark treatment by conventional medical practitioners are 50 ibid 51 http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camstats/2007/camsurvey_fs1.htm 52 Susan Eardley et al, \"CAM use in Europe, the patients' perspective.

In Finland CAM is also reimbursed if provided by a physician, or for acupuncture, chiropractic and naprapathy if provided in collaboration with a physician, the health insurance also covers some of the cost for homeopathy. In the UK some forms of CAM are also covered by the NHS. In France, Specific medical activities and products are covered, including chiropractic, medical phytotherapy consultations, and complementary/alternative technical sessions with an approved kinesiotherapist. In addition some CAM is partially covered. In Germany t he statutory health insurance system covers acupuncture and homeopathy within certain conditions. In Hungary CAM is partially covered: massage and acupuncture treatm ents delivered either in public hospitals or public outpatients' surgeries (public) .54 5.3 ACCESS TO HIGH QUALI TY INFORMATION ABOUT CAM THERAPIES Access to reliable, high quality information for the public about Complementary and Alternative Medicine is a key challenge. Patients can come across many claims from CAM therapies across the internet. The UK NHS and the U.S NCCAM both respectively provide lay language information and advice on CAM for the public.55 The Cochrane collaboration also produces lay languag e summary of their review on CAM treatments which are available to patients and the public. Leaflets and advertisement of homeopathic and herbal medicinal products are regulated under the same rules as for medicines in the EU, but for other products (botan ical, dietary supplements) and CAM practices this depends of Member States legislation. When looking at citizens' attitude toward CAM information, the EU CAMbrella study noted that the public still rely mostly on their healthcare professionals for information about CAM in these countries where CAM is most commonly provided by \"conventional\" doctors and healthcare services. In other countries patients' social network , family and relatives are one of the main source of information on CAM. They also rely on media coverage (both print, and TV and internet).56 Another challenge is coverage of CAM by the media. While no study has been conducted in Europe, a study in Australia has indicated that it was generally low, with claims of the success of CAM in treating a condition insufficiently scrutinized (though with variation of quality depending of diseases) . In addition m ost stories leave out cost and potential harm of CAM treatment. In the EU no formal independent body or structure exists to provide information on CAM. 57 54 Solveig Wiesener et al \"Legal status and regulation of CAM in Europe.
