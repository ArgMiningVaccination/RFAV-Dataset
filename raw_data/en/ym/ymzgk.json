Your costs in Original Medicare You pay nothing for the COVID-19 vaccine for as long as the federal government continues buying and distributing the vaccine. You won't pay a deductible or copayment, and your provider can't charge you an administration fee to give you the shot. When the federal government stops buying and distributing the vaccine, you'll still pay nothing for the vaccine if your doctor or other health care provider accepts assignment.

Contact your regular doctor or health care provider and ask if they're able to give you the COVID-19 vaccine in your home. If they can't, they might be able to refer you to someone who can do this. You can also call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) for vaccine contacts in your state. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. More details on providers of the COVID-19 vaccine are also available on Vaccines.gov. Remember, don't give out your Medicare Number or accept a vaccine from anyone who isn't a known or trusted provider, or who contacts you without your invitation. If you paid to get a COVID-19 vaccine When you get a COVID-19 vaccine, your provider can't charge you for an office visit or other fee if the vaccine is the only medical service you get. If you get other medical services at the same time you get the COVID-19 vaccine, you may owe a copayment or deductible for those services. If you paid a fee or got a bill for a COVID-19 vaccine, check this list to see if your provider should have charged you: - Check the receipts and statements you get from your provider for any mistakes. - Call your provider's office to ask about any charges you think are incorrect. The person you speak to may help you better understand the services you got, or realize they made a billing error. - If you have Original Medicare, review your \"Medicare Summary Notice\" for errors. Report anything suspicious to Medicare by calling 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). - If you have other coverage like a Medicare Advantage Plan, review your \"Explanation of Benefits.\" Report anything suspicious to your insurer. If you think your provider incorrectly charged you for the COVID-19 vaccine, ask them for a refund. If you think your provider charged you for an office visit or other fee, but the only service you got was a COVID-19 vaccine, report them to the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by calling 1-800-HHS-TIPS or visiting [TIPS.HHS.GOV](https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/report-fraud/index.asp). Be alert for scammers trying to steal your Medicare Number. Only share your Medicare Number with your provider when you get COVID-related services. As always, guard your Medicare card like a credit card and check Medicare claims summary forms for errors. If someone you don't know calls asking for your Medicare Number, hang up. "}
