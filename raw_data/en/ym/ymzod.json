In addition, we love to compliment western medicine's care for cancer with our list of holistic therapies. Modernizing East Asian Medicine, Bridging the Gap between Eastern and Western Medicine, Advocating for individualized healthcare and giving people a choice when it comes to their medicine . Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a comprehensive medical system developed in China that utilizes 4 categories of techniques, or \"pillars\" to treat an individual. These techniques can be used separately, or for better results, used in combination with each other. Acupuncture, which many are most familiar with, is just one pillar under the house of TCM techniques. What are our clients saying? Acupuncture/Acupressure involves the use of sterile, one time use stainless steel fine needles that are placed in specific areas of the body called acupuncture points. These points are linked to individual meridians, or pathways in which Qi flows. The pathways follow a separate system but have a connection to the autonomic nervous system. When an acupuncture needle stimulates a certain point, it sends a signal to the brain, and a combination of neurotransmitters may be released, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine to help the body to relax, hurdle any pain related to a condition, and reprogram the body to create a pathway for healing. Acupuncture can also be used as a preventative to disease. Chinese Herbal Medicine Chinese Herbal Medicine is when a TCM herbal practitioner will prescribe a specific combination of Chinese herbs to an individual. Very rarely will you see one specific herb prescribed, as the way this medicine works is by combining the herbs within an herbal formula. Herb combinations are chosen based on function, taste, and which organs the herbs travel to. Each herb serves as having a certain function, and when combined with other herbs will have different effects. Manual Therapy/NAET Cupping is a manual therapy that involves the use of glass cups. A vacuum is created using fire and cups are applied to the body to create a vacuum suction. This technique brings circulation to the area, reduces inflammation, helps facilitate lymph drainage, and can remove the lactic acid buildup that occurs in sore muscles after an injury or working out. It is also known to treat a cold or asthma by breaking up phlegm in the lungs. It may leave marks on the body, this is part of a detoxification process bringing any stagnation or injury to the surface to be released and accelerate healing Therapeutic Exercises/Meditation Qi gong is literally translated at 'Qi Practice\". It is a set of therapeutic exercises, breathing techniques, stretches and meditations that can be shown to a patient during treatment, and/or prescribed as homework to further enhance treatment. Custom Qi gong techniques are based from the theories of 5 phases and yin/yang. Therapeutic Massage Therapeutic Massage is a type of Massage that is used to target specific areas of the body in order to achieve a therapeutic result. Massages are custom to the patient and can combine the techniques of Swedish massage, Amma, along with deep tissue. Massages are tailored to you depending on what is needed or requested. Digital Online Self Care Course 5 Elements to Freedom My experiences have brought me online, where I have developed the self-study digital course, 5 Elements to Freedom. In the course I teach you how to diagnose and treat your own energetic imbalances, so you can learn to prevent disease, and learn to live a meaningful, fulfilled, spiritual life. What is a 5 element freedom fighter? A freedom fighter is someone who is not afraid to be who they want to be and are willing to fight for their own personal growth, self love and care to reach their souls purpose regardless of what others say and whatever cultural or social norms there are. They are willing to fight for their own energetic freedom to be whomever they want to be. They are people who have been through trauma, the moms who are not afraid to also be Entrepreneurs, they are the Women and men who are not afraid to be CEOS, trailblazers, The people who have learned through experiences and the ones that are not afraid to live their dreams for the sake of showing their children or family they need to live their own. This is the person that is completely aligned with their purpose and gifts that they want to serve the world with and is not afraid of being unique. They fight for their own freedom to be who they want to be, and how they will care for themselves . They know exactly who they are and they know that their freedom is worth fighting for so that the world and they can be in an aligned place.
