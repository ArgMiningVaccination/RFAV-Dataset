At N uNM, she found her niche studying integrative health sciences after finally elucidating a desire to work in a field that synthesizes the complementary realms of science and spirituality. Stephanie is impassioned by many things, but namely education, natural medicine, and the environment with a specific emphasis on agriculture and soil ecology. She hopes to continue her medical education through the N d program at N uNM and eventually create a career that allows for the continued exploration of education, medicine, and ecology in an inspiring and world- reaching manner. Denice Valencia Martinez became very intrigued in learning about nutrition while taking classes at Health & Science High School. She wanted to expand on that knowledge, and at the age of sixteen she knew NuNM was the place. Prior to enrolling, d enice held various internships and volunteered in places like Providence St. Vincent; was awarded a scholarship to study abroad in Italy; and completed many classes including Intercultural Leadership, Sociology, Latino studies and Women's studies. She is very passionate in helping address racial disparities in health care and sees herself working in a place where she can provide a multidisciplinary approach to nutrition education in a bilingual setting. d enice would like to thank her parents, brother and grandparents for their sacrifices and continuous support.School of undergraduate Studies Saturday, June 27 , 2020 | n oon 4 nunm CommenC ement 2020The School of Undergraduate Studies nurtures students seeking meaningful careers in the health sciences.
