For children, you may designate a pediatrician as the Primary Care P hysician. You do not need prior authorization from Health Advantage or from any other person (including a Primary Care Physician) in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in our network who specialize s in obstetrics or gynecology. The health care professional, however, may be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining prior authorization for certain services, following a pre -approved treatment plan, or procedures for making referr als. For a list of participating health care professionals who specialize in obstetrics or gynecology, contact Health Advantage or visit our Website at WWW.HEALTHADVANTAGE -HMO.COM . 6 1.0 HOW THE COVERAGE UN DER YOUR INSURANCE PLAN WORKS 1.1 Your employer has established and maintains an employee health benefit plan (\"Plan\") for employees and their eligible dependents. The Employer admin isters that Plan and actively promotes the Plan to its employees. The Employer and you, through your premium contributions, have purchased a Plan of insurance benefits provided by the Group Contract and Evidence of Coverage issued by HMO Partners, Inc. d/ b/a Health Advantage that provides a range of coverage for medical services you may need. This is a very valuable benefit for you, but you should understand clearly that your Plan does NOT cover all medical services, drugs, supplies, tests or equipment (\" Health Interventions \" or \" Interventions \"). A Plan covering all health Interventions would be prohibitively expensive. For that reason, we have offered and you have purchased a more limited Plan. This document is your guide to what you have and have not purchased; in other words, what is and is not eligible for benefits under your Plan. Accordingly, you should read this entire document carefully both now and BEFORE you obtain medical or preventive health services be sure you understand what is covered an d the limitations on your coverage. 1.2 The philosophy and purpose behind your Plan is that we want you to have coverage for the vast majority of medical needs or emergencies you may face, including most Hospital and Physician Services, emergency care, pre ventive and wellness services, medications, supplies and equipment. However, in order to keep costs of your Plan within reasonable limits, we have deliberately excluded coverage of a number of specific Health Interventions , we have placed coverage limits on some other Interventions , and we have established an overall standard we call the \"Primary Coverage Criteria\" that each and every claim for benefits must meet in order to be covered under your Plan. 1.3 Here is an important thing for you to clearly un derstand. For any Health Intervention, there are six general coverage criteria that must be met in order for that intervention to qualify for coverage under your Plan. 1. The Primary Coverage Criteria must be met. 2. The Health Intervention must conform t o specific limitations stated in your Plan. 3. The Health Intervention must not be specifically excluded under the terms of your Plan. 4. At the time of the intervention, you must meet the Plan's eligibility standards. 5. You must comply with the Plan's Pr ovider network and cost sharing arrangements; and 6. You must follow the Plan's procedures for filing claims. The following discussion will give you a brief description of each of these qualifications. 1.4 The Primary Coverage Criteria . The Primary Cover age Criteria apply to ALL benefits you may claim under your Plan. It does not matter what types of Health Intervention may be involved or when or where you obtain the intervention. The Primary Coverage Criteria are designed to allow Plan benefits for only those Health Interventions that are proven as safe and effective treatment. The Primary Coverage Criteria also provide benefits only for the less invasive or less risky intervention when such intervention would safely and effectively treat the medical con dition; or they provide benefits for treatment in an outpatient, doctor's office or home care setting when such treatment would be a safe and effective alternative to Hospital ization. Examples of the types of Health Interventions that the Primary Coverage Criteria exclude from coverage include such things as the cost of a hospitalization for a minor cold or some other condition that could be treated outside the Hospital , or the cost of some investigational drug or treatment such as herbal therapy or some f orms of high dose Chemotherapy not shown to have any beneficial or curative effect on a particular cancerous condition. Finally, the Primary Coverage Criteria require that if there are two or more effective alternative Health Interventions , the Plan shoul d limit its payment to the Allowance or Allowable Charge for the most cost effective intervention. The specific coverage standards that must be met under the Primary Coverage Criteria are outlined in detail in Section 2.0 of this document. 1.5 Specific Li mitations in Your Plan. Because of the high cost of some Health Interventions , as well as the difficulty in some cases of determining whether an intervention is really needed, we include coverage for such Health Interventions but place limits on the exten t of coverage by limiting the number of Provider visits or treatments, or treatment received during a Contract Year or other specified time period. Examples of such limitations include a limit on the number of covered visits for home health services, phys ical, occupational and speech therapy. Other types of limitations include requirements that an intervention be provided in a particular location or by a Provider holding a particular type of license, or in accordance with a written treatment plan or other documentation. Common benefits and limitations are outlined in detail in Section 3.0 of this document. You will note that this document refers to Coverage Policies we have developed that may address limitations of coverage for a particular service, trea tment or drug. You may 7 request a copy of our Coverage Policy with respect to a particular service, treatment or drug, or, if you have Internet access, you may review all our established Coverage Policies on our web site at WWW.HEALTHADVANTAGE -HMO.COM . 1.6 Specific Exclusions in Your Plan. There are many possible reasons why we have selected a particular condition, health care Provider, Health Intervention, or service to be excluded from your Plan. Some exclusions are based on the availability of other coverage or financing for certain types of injuries. For example, injuries you receive on the job are generally covered by workers' compensation. Other exclusions are based on the need to try to keep your co verage affordable, covering basic health care service needs, but not covering every possible desired intervention. The exclusion for Cosmetic Services is an example of this type of exclusion. The plan excludes coverage of some health care Providers becau se we believe the Provider is not qualified or because the Provider lacks experience. For example the plan does not cover services rendered by unlicensed Providers or by Hospital residents, interns, students or fellows. Other exclusions are based on our judgment that the need for such Health Intervention is questionable in many cases, or that the services are of unknown or unproven beneficial effect. Examples of these types of exclusions include biofeedback and cranial electrotherapy stimulation devices, as well as some forms of high dose Chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. Before you undergo treatment or tests, you should review the specific exclusions listed in Section 4.0 of this document. If you have any question about whether a specific ex clusion applies, discuss it with your doctor(s). Call our Customer Service representatives if you need assistance. You may also request a copy of our Coverage Policy with respect to a particular service, treatment or drug, or, if you have Internet access , you may review all our established Coverage Policies on our web site at WWW.HEALTHADVANTAGE - HMO.COM . 1.7 Provider Network and Cost Sharing Procedures. Your plan does not provide coverage for one hundred percent of the costs associated with covered Health Interventions . You are expected to pay Copayments, Deductible and Coinsurance. You are encouraged to select, and to maintain a patient -physician relationship with, your Primary Care Physician. Your co verage includes a special limitation in the form of provider network requirements. These provisions are designed to try to hold down the costs of your coverage by limiting the coverage to those physicians, hospitals or other health care providers who participate in our provider networks, and by having your primary care physician consult with you in advance on whether the sometimes more expensive services of a specialist are really needed, or whether the primary care physician can adequately address the pro blem. You and your physician are always free to make any decision you believe is best for you concerning whether to receive any particular service or treatment, or whether to see any provider (in or out of the network). However, if you do decide to go \"o ut- of-network\" for services or treatment, your coverage will be reduced or limited to the out -of-network rate. In some cases, you also may be required to meet certain prior approval of coverage or precertification of coverage procedures as outlined in thi s document. There are exceptions to the network for emergencies or, in rare cases upon approval by Health Advantage, where services or treatment covered under your Plan are not available for some reason from an In -Network Provider. In -Network Providers a re identified in our published provider directory, or you may call Customer Service to ask about a specific provider, or visit our Website at WWW.HEALTHADVANTAGE -HMO.COM . A full explanation of the provider network requirements and your payment obligations applicable to your Plan is set forth in Section 5.0 and the Schedule of benefits. 1.8 Eligibility Standards. You must be eligible for benefits under your Plan at the time you receive a Health Interventio n. Eligibility standards are set forth in Section 6.0 of this document. Since your coverage is through a group contract , this means you must be an eligible member of the Group, either as a Subscriber or an eligible Dependent of a Subscriber . In order to be an eligible member of the Group, you must meet the Group eligibility standards, which often include limited enrollment periods or Waiting Periods , before your Group coverage takes effect. In all cases, in order to be considered \"eligible\" for coverage , your Plan must be valid and in force at the time the services or treatment are provided. All premiums must be timely paid. It is important to understand the provisions of Section 6.0 that outline the circumstances under which your coverage may terminate under the Plan. This section also describes the special situations provided by state and federal law that allow continued coverage under the Plan for a limited time after you are no longer an Subscriber or Dependent. This section also describes the circ umstances under which you may convert your coverage to an individual plan. 1.9 Claim Filing Procedures. Your Plan provides procedures that you, your Provider or your Authorized Representative must follow in filing claims with Health Advantage . Your failu re to follow these procedures 8 could result in significant delays in the processing of your claim, as well as potential denial of benefits. For example not informing a provider of your coverage under the Evidence of Coverage which causes the claim to not me et timely filing requirements will make you fully responsible for charges for services from that provider. These procedures are set out in Section 7.0. In addition, Section 7.0 explains how you can appeal a benefit determination in the event you believe t hat such benefit determination does not comply with the terms of the Plan. 1.10 Plan Administration. Information about the incentives Health Advantage provides In -Network Physicians is set out in Section 8.0. Certain important matters, not otherwise descr ibed in this Evidence of Coverage , are set out in Section 9.0. Section 10.0 is a glossary of defined terms used in the Evidence of Coverage . Finally, Section 1 0.0 provides information the Plan is required to provide in accordance with the Employee Retire ment Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 2.0 PRIMARY COVERAGE CRITERIA 2.1 Purpose and Effect of Primary Coverage Criteria. The P rimary Coverage Criteria are set out in this Section 2.0 of this document. The Primary Coverage Criteria are designed to allow Plan benefits for only those Interventions that are proven as safe and effective treatment. Another goal of the Primary Coverag e Criteria is to provide benefits only for the least invasive or risky Intervention when such Intervention would safely and effectively treat the medical condition, or to provide benefits for treatment in an outpatient, doctor's office or home care setting when such treatment would be a safe and effective alternative to hospitalization. Finally, if there is more than one effective Health Intervention available, the Primary Coverage Criteria allow the Plan to limit its payment to the Allowance or Allowable Charge for the most cost-effective Intervention. Regardless of anything else in this Plan, and regardless of any other communications or materials you may receive in connection with your Plan, you will not have coverage for any service, any medication, an y treatment, any procedure or any equipment, supplies or associated costs UNLESS the Primary Coverage Criteria set forth in this Section are met. At the same time, bear in mind that just because the Primary Coverage Criteria are met does not necessarily m ean the treatment or services will be covered under your Plan. For example, a Health Intervention that meets the Primary Coverage Criteria will be excluded if the condition being treated is excluded by the Plan. (See Subsection 4.2) As explained in the preceding Section 1.0, the Primary Coverage Criteria represent one category of six general coverage criteria that must be met for coverage in all cases. The Primary Coverage Criteria are as follows: 2.2 Elements of the Primary Coverage Criteria . In order to be covered, medical services, drugs, treatments, procedures, tests, equipment or supplies (\"Interventions \") must be recommended by your treating physician and meet all of the following requirements: 1. The Intervention must be an item or service delivered or undertaken primarily to prevent, diagnose, detect, treat, palliate or alleviate a medical condition or to maintain or restore functional ability of the mind or body. A \"medical con dition\" means a disease, illness, injury, pregnancy or a biological or psychological condition that, if untreated, impairs or threatens to impair ability of the body or mind to function in a normal, healthy manner. 2. The Intervention must be proven to be effective (as defined in Subsections 2.3.1.a. or 2.3.1.b, below) in preventing, treating, diagnosing, detecting , or palliating a medical condition. 3. The intervention must be the most appropriate supply or level of service, considering potential benefits and harm to the patient. The following examples illustrate application of this standard (but are not intended to limit the scope of the standard): (i) An Intervention is not appropriate, for purposes of the Primary Coverage Criteria, if it would expose t he patient to more invasive procedures or greater risks when less invasive procedures or less risky Interventions would be safe and effective to diagnose, detect, treat or palliate a medical condition. (ii) An Intervention is not appropriate, under the Pr imary Coverage Criteria, if it involves Hospital ization or other intensive treatment settings when the Intervention could be administered safely and effectively in an outpatient or other less intensive setting, such as the home. 4. The Primary Coverage C riteria allows the Plan to limit its coverage to payment of the Allowance or Allowable Charge for the most cost -effective Intervention. 9 \"Cost -effective\" means a Health Intervention where the benefits and harms relative to the costs represents an economic ally efficient use of resources for patients with the medical condition being treated through the Health Intervention. For example, if the benefits and risks to the patient of two alternative Interventions are comparable , a Health Intervention costing $1, 000 will be more cost effective than a Health Intervention costing $10,000. \"Cost -effective\" shall not necessarily mean the lowest price. 2.3 Primary Coverage Criteria Definitions. The follow ing definitions are used in describing the elements of the Primary Coverage Criteria: 1. Effective defined a. An existing Intervention (one that is commonly recognized as accepted or standard treatment or which has gained widespread, substantially unchalle nged use and acceptance throughout the United States) will be deemed \"effective\" for purposes of the Primary Coverage Criteria if the Intervention is found to achieve its intended purpose and to prevent, cure, alleviate or enable diagnosis or detection of a medical condition without exposing the patient to risks that outweigh the potential benefits. This determination will be based on consideration of the following factors, in descending order of priority and weight: i. scientific evidence, as defined in S ubsection 2.3.2, below (where available); or ii. if scientific evidence is not available, expert opinion(s) (whether published or furnished by private letter or report) of an Independent Medical Reviewer(s) with education, training and experience in the re levant medical field or subject area; or iii. if scientific evidence is not available, and if expert opinion is either unavailable for some reason or is substantially equally divided, professional standards, as defined and qualified in Subsection 2.3.3, be low, may be consulted. iv. If neither scientific evidence, expert opinion nor professional standards show that an existing intervention will achieve its intended purpose to prevent, cure, alleviate or enable diagnosis or detection of a medical condition, t hen Health Advantage in its discretion may find that such existing intervention is not effective and on that basis fails to meet the Primary Coverage Criteria. b. A new Intervention (one that is not commonly recognized as accepted or standard treatment or which has not gained widespread, substantially unchallenged use and acceptance throughout the United States) will be deemed \"effective\" for purposes of the Primary Coverage Criteria if there is scientific evidence (as defined in Subsection 2.3.2, below) sh owing that the Intervention will achieve its intended purpose and will prevent, cure, alleviate or enable diagnosis or detection of a medical condition without exposing the patient to risks that outweigh the potential benefits. Scientific evidence is deem ed to exist to show that a new Intervention is not effective if the procedure is the subject of an ongoing phase I, II, or III trial or is otherwise under study to determine its maximum tolerated dose, its toxicity, its safety, its efficacy, or its efficac y as compared with a standard means of treatment or diagnosis. If there is a lack of scien tific evidence regarding a new Intervention, or if the available scientific evidence is in conflict or the subject of continuing debate, the new Intervention shall b e deemed \"not effective,\" and therefore not covered in accordance with the Primary Coverage Criteria, with one exception -- if there is a new Intervention for which clinical trials have not been conducted because the disease in issue is rare or new or affe cts only a remote population, then the intervention may be deemed \"effective\" if, but only if, it meets the definition of \"effective\" as defined for existing Interventions in Subsection 2.3.1.a, above. 2. Scientific Evidence defined. \"Scientific Evidenc e,\" for purposes of the Primary Coverage Criteria, shall mean only one or more of the following listed sources of relevant clinical information and evaluation: a. Results of randomized controlled clinical trials, as published in the authoritative medical and scientific literature that directly demonstrate a statistically significant positive effect of an Intervention on a medical condition. For purposes of this Subsection a., \"authoritative medical and scientific literature\" shall be such publications as a re recognized by Health Advantage , listed in its Coverage Policy or otherwise listed as authoritative medical and 10 scientific literature on Heath Advantage 's web site at WWW.HEALTHADVANTAGE - HMO.COM ; or b. Published reports of independent technology or pharmaceutical assessment organizations recognized as authoritative by Health Advantage . For purposes of this Subsection b. an independent technology or pharmaceutical assessment organization shall be considere d \"authoritative\" if it is recognized as such by Health Advantage , listed in its Coverage Policy or otherwise listed as authoritative on the Health Advantage 's web site at WWW.HEALTHADVANTAGE -HMO.COM . 3. Professional Standards defined. \"Professional standards,\" for purposes of applying the \"effectiveness\" standard of the Primary Coverage Criteria to an existing Intervention, shall mean only the published clinical standards, published guidelines or published assessments of professional accreditation or certification organizations or of such accredited national professional associations as are recognized by the Health Advantage 's Medical Director as speaking authoritatively on behalf of the licensed medical pr ofessionals participating in or represented by the associations. Health Advantage shall have full discretion whether to accept or reject the statements of any professional association or professional accreditation or certification organization as \"profess ional standards\" for purposes of this Primary Coverage Criteria. No such statements shall be regarded as eligible to be classified as \"professional standards\" under the Primary Coverage Criteria unless such statements specifically address effectiveness of the intervention, and conclude with substantial supporting evidence that the Intervention is safe, that its benefits outweigh potential risks to the patient, and that it is more likely than not to achieve its intended purpose and to prevent, cure, allevia te or enable diagnosis or detection of a medical condition. 2.4 Application and Appeal of Primary Coverage Criteria. 1. The following rules apply to any application of the Primary Coverage Criteria. Health Advantage shall have full discretion in applying the Primary Coverage Criteria, and in interpreting any of its terms or phrases, or the manner in which it shall apply to a given Intervention. No Intervention shall be deemed to meet the Primary Coverage Criteria unless the Intervention qualifies under ALL of the following rules: a. Illegality - An Intervention does not meet the Primary Coverage Criteria if it is illegal to administer or receive it under federal laws or regulation s or the law or regulations of the state where administered. b. FDA Position - An Intervention does not meet the Primary Coverage Criteria if it involves any device or drug that requires approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), and FDA ap proval for marketing of the drug or device for a particular medical condition has not been issued prior to your date of service. In addition, an Intervention does not meet the Primary Coverage Criteria if the FDA or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or any agency or division thereof, through published reports or statements, or through official announcements or press releases issued by authorized spokespersons, have concluded that the Intervention or a means or method of administering it is u nsafe, unethical or contrary to federal laws or regulations. Neither FDA Pre-Market Approval nor FDA finding of substantial equivalency under 510(k) automatically guarantees coverage of a drug or device. c. Proper License - An Intervention does not meet t he Primary Coverage Criteria if the health care professional or facility administering it does not hold the proper license, permit, accreditation or other regulatory approval required under applicable laws or regulations in order to administer the Interven tion. d. Plan Exclusions, Limitations or Eligibility Standards - Even if an Intervention otherwise meets the Primary Coverage Criteria, it is not covered under this Plan if the Intervention is subject to a Plan exclusion or limitation, or if you fail to me et Plan eligibility requirements. e. Position Statements of Professional Organizations - Regardless of whether an Intervention meets some of the other requirements of the Primary Coverage Criteria, the Intervention shall not be covered under the Plan if an y national professional association, any accrediting or certification organization, any widely -used medical compendium, or published guidelines of any national or international workgroup of scientific or medical experts have classified such intervention or its means or method of administration as 11 \"experimental\" or \"investigational\" or as questionable or of unknown benefit. However, an Intervention that fails to meet other requirements of the Primary Coverage Criteria shall not be covered under the Plan, ev en if any of the foregoing organizations or groups classify the Intervention as not \"experimental\" or not \"investigational,\" or conclude that it is beneficial or no longer subject to question. For purposes of this Subsection e., \"national professional association\" or \"accrediting or certifying organization,\" or \"national or international workgroup of scientific or medical experts\" shall be such organizations or groups recognized by Health Advantage , listed in its Coverage Policy or otherwise listed as authoritative on the Health Advantage 's web site at WWW.HEALTHADVANTAGE - HMO.COM . f. Coverage Policy - With respect to certain drugs, treatments, services, tests, equipment or supplies, Health Advantage has devel oped specific Coverage Policies, which have been put into writing, and are published on the Health Advantage' s web site at WWW.HEALTHADVANTAGE -HMO.COM . If Health Advantage has developed a specific Coverage Policy that applies to the If Health Advantage has developed a specific Coverage Policy that applies to the drug, treatment, service, test, equipment or supply that you received or seek to have covered under your Plan, the Coverage Policy shall be deemed to be determinative in evaluating whether such drug, treatment, service, test, equipment or supply meets the Primary Coverage Criteria; however, the absence of a specific Coverage Policy with respect to any particular drug, treatment, service, test, equip ment or supply shall not be construed to mean that such drug, treatment, service, test, equipment or supply meets the Primary Coverage Criteria. 2. You may appeal a determination by Health Advantage that an Intervention does not meet the Primary Coverage Criteria to the Member Response Coordinator. Use the procedures for appeals outlined in Sections 7.2 and 7.3. 3. Any appeal available with respect to a Primary Coverage Criteria determination shall be subject to the terms, conditions and definitions set forth in the Primary Coverage Criteria. An appeal shall also be subject to the terms, conditions and definitions set forth elsewhere in this Plan. The Appeals Reviewer or an External Review organization shall render its independent evaluation so as to comply with and achieve the intended purpose of the Primary Coverage Criteria and other provisions of this Plan. 3.0 BENEFITS AND SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS IN YOUR PLAN Because of the high co st of some services or treatments, as well as the difficulty in some cases of determining whether services are really needed, we include coverage for such services or treatments but place limits on the extent of coverage, either by limiting the number of P rovider visits or treatments during a Contract Year or other specified period of time. This Section 3.0 describes medical services, drugs, supplies, tests and equipment for which coverage is provided of the Plan, provided all terms, conditions, exclusions and limitations of the Plan, including the six coverage criteria, are satisfied. This Section 3.0 sets out specific limitations applicable to each covered medical service, drug, supply, test or equipment. You will note references to Deductible, Coinsuran ce and Copayment obligations. For a description of the amount of these obligations and how they may vary depending upon whether you select an In-Network Provider or an Out-of- Network Provider , refer to Section 5.0 , the definition of Allowance or Allowable Charge as set out in the Glossary of Terms and the Schedule of Benefits. 3.1 Professional Services.

This Section explains the provider network procedures you should follow in order to effectively utilize the services of In - Network Providers, see Subsection 5.1. Under your plan, you are responsible for part of the co sts associated with covered services, supplies, equipment and treatment. Your responsibilities are explained in this Section, see Subsection 5.2. Finally, this Section explains how costs of benefits that are covered by another benefit plan are covered by the Plan, see Subsection 5.3. 5.1 Network Procedures 1. Standard Benefits. Subject to all terms, conditions, exclusions and limitations of the Plan set forth in this Evidence of Coverage, coverage is provided f or Health Interventions you receive from a Provider as defined by the Plan. See Subsection 10.8 6. This coverage is most effective and advantageous for you when the services of In -Network Providers are used. All Benefits are subject to the Health Advanta ge Allowance or Allowable Charge. 2. Primary Care Physician (PCP) Selection. You are encouraged to select and maintain a patient - physician relationship with your PCP. The PCP selected must be an In -Network Physician listed in the Health Advantage Provid er Directory as a PCP and must be accepting Members. You may contact Customer Service to select a PCP or change your PCP. The Provider Directory is available at WWW.HEALTHADVANTAGE -HMO.COM . PCP changes ar e effective on the first day of the following month. If you change your PCP, any outstanding Referral(s) from a previous PCP will terminate, unless the new PCP reauthorizes such Referral. 3. Open Access. This plan is an Open Access Plan, which allows you to receive In -Network benefits for Covered Services provided by In -Network Providers without first having these services authorized, referred or arranged by a PCP. 4. Point of Service (POS) Option. This plan is a Point of Service (POS) Plan. A POS Plan allows a Member the option of obtaining Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provider without first receiving authorization from the Member's Primary Care Physician or Health Advantage. However, the POS option is not as effective or advantageous for yo u as when the services of In -Network Providers are used. Claims associated with services provided by Out -of-Network Providers may have less advantageous Deductible, Coinsurance and Annual Limitation on Cost Sharing than claims for services of In -Network P roviders. For the definitions and explanation of the terms \"Deductible,\" \"Coinsurance,\" and \"Annual Limitation on Cost Sharing \" please refer to Section 10.0 Glossary of Terms and Subsection 5.2. 5. Out-of-Network Providers. Reimbursement for services b y Out -of-Network Providers generally will be less than payment for the same services when provided by an In -Network Provider and could result in substantial out -of-pocket expense. The Out -of-Network Deductible, Coinsurance and Annual Coinsurance Maximum s et forth in the Schedule of Benefits are applied to the Allowance or Allowable Charges for services and supplies you receive from an Out -of-Network Provider, unless : a. Emergency or Imperative Care Services. The Intervention is for Emergency Care (see Subsection 10. 32) or Imperative Care (see Subsection 10.4 9) and initial services are provided within forty -eight (48) hours of the onset of the injury or illness, in which case the applicable In -Network Copayment, Coinsurance and Annual Coinsurance Maximum ap ply; b. Continuity of Care, Prior to Coverage. You request coverage by notifying Health Advantage that prior to the effective date of your coverage, you were engaged with an Out - of-Network Provider for a scheduled procedure or ongoing treatment otherwise covered under the terms of this Plan, and that a change from such Out -of-Network Provider for such procedure or treatment would be detrimental to your health. If Health Advantage approves coverage for the scheduled procedure or ongoing treatment, benefits will be provided, 41 subject to applicable In-Network Copayments, Coinsurance and Annual Coinsurance Limit to claims for services and supplies rendered by the Out -of-Network Provider for such condition after Health Advantage's written approval until the proc edure or treatment ends or until the end of ninety (90) days, whichever occurs first; c. Continuity of Care, Pregnancy, Prior to Coverage. You request coverage by notifying Health Advantage that prior to the effective date of your coverage, you were recei ving obstetrical care from an Out -of-Network Provider for a pregnancy otherwise covered under the terms of this Evidence of Coverage, and that you were in the third trimester of your pregnancy on the effective date of your coverage. If Health Advantage ap proves In - Network coverage for the requested obstetrical care, benefits will be provided, subject to applicable In -Network Copayments, Coinsurance and Annual Coinsurance Limits for services and supplies received from this Out -of-Network Provider after Heal th Advantage's written approval and will continue to apply to claims for services and supplies rendered by such Out -of-Network Provider until the completion of the pregnancy, including two (2) months of postnatal visits; d. Provider Leaves Health Advantag e Network. You request coverage by notifying Health Advantage that your Provider was formerly an In -Network Provider when your ongoing treatment for an acute condition covered under the terms of the Plan began and that you request In -Network benefits for the continuation of such ongoing treatment. If Health Advantage approves coverage for the ongoing treatment, benefits will be provided, subject to applicable In -Network Copayments, Coinsurance and Annual Coinsurance Limits for services and supplies render ed by the Out -of-Network Provider for such condition after Health Advantage's written approval until the end of the current episode of treatment or until the end of ninety (90) days, whichever occurs first; e. Provider Leaves Health Advantage Network, Pre gnancy. You request coverage by notifying Health Advantage that your Provider was formerly an In -Network Provider when you began receiving obstetrical care for a pregnancy covered under the terms of the Plan, and that you were in the third trimester of yo ur pregnancy on the date that the Provider left the Health Advantage network. If Health Advantage approves coverage for the requested obstetrical care, benefits will be provided, subject to applicable In -Network Copayments, Coinsurance and Annual Coinsura nce Limits, for services and supplies received from this Out-of-Network Provider after Health Advantage's written approval and will continue to apply to claims for services and supplies rendered by such Out -of-Network Provider until the completion of the p regnancy, including two (2) months of postnatal visits. f. Out-of-Network Referral. You request coverage by notifying Health Advantage prior to receiving a Health Intervention and Health Advantage has determined that the required covered services or supp lies associated with such Health Intervention are not available from an In -Network Provider and has provided you a written approval of in -network coverage for such services or supplies, applicable In -Network Copayments, Coinsurance and Annual Coinsurance L imit will apply to the claims for the services that you receive from the Out -of-Network Provider. Notification to Health Advantage of requests for coverage of out -of-network services should be made by writing Health Advantage, Attention: Medical Audit and Review Services, Post Office Box 8069, Little Rock, Arkansas 72203, and should be received at least 15 working days prior to your receipt of such services or supplies. See Section 7.0 for procedures related to urgent care requests. 6. No Balance Billing f rom In -Network Providers. In-Network Providers are paid directly by Health Advantage and have agreed to accept Health Advantage's payment for covered services as payment in full except for applicable Copayments, Coinsurance and any specific benefit limita tion, if applicable. A Member is responsible for billed charges in excess of Health Advantage's payment when Providers who are not In -Network Providers render services. These excess charges could amount to thousands of dollars in additional out of pocket expenses to the Member. 7. Provider Directory. The determination of whether a Provider is In -Network or Out -of-Network is the responsibility of Health Advantage. Health Advantage or your Employer can provide a list of In - 42 Network Providers. You may also obtain a list of In -Network Providers on the Health Advantage web site WWW.HEALTHADVANTAGE -HMO.COM . A Provider's network status may change; therefore You should verify a Provider's status by calling Custom er Service at (800) 843 -1329 prior to your receipt of services. 8. Blue Card Program. Your plan includes the BlueCard program. This program allows you to receive in -network benefits without the provider billing more than the Allowance or Allowed Charge for Emergency Care or Imperative Care from a Provider located outside of Arkansas, provided such Provider contracts with the local Blue Cross or Blue Shield Company. Your expenses will be limited to the applicable In -Network Deductible, Copayment and Coins urance. You may verify the BlueCard status of an out of state Provider by calling 1 -800-810-2583. For a description of how to file BlueCard claims, refer to Subsection 7.1.10. 9. Provider Status may Change. It is possible that you might not be able to o btain services from a particular In -Network Provider. The network of Providers is subject to change. You might find that a particular In -Network Provider may not be accepting new patients. If a Provider leaves the Health Advantage Network or is otherwis e not available to you, unless Subsection 5.1.4 applies, you must choose another In -Network Provider to receive In -Network benefits. 10. Providers may not be In -Network for All Services. An In -Network Provider's agreement may not include all covered benef its. In particular all services provided at as In -Network Hospital may not be provided by an In -Network Provider; e.g. anesthesia, radiology or laboratory tests. Some In - Network Providers contract with Health Advantage to provide only certain covered ben efits, but not all covered benefits. Some Providers choose to be an In -Network Provider for only some Covered Services. Refer to the Provider directory, ask your Provider or contact Customer Service for assistance. 11. Relation of Health Advantage to P roviders. The relationship between Health Advantage and In - Network Providers is that of independent contractors. Health Advantage is not a provider of health care services but instead offers health plan coverage for services provided by treating provider (s). Health Advantage does not recommend, direct or control delivery of any health care services. In - Network Providers are not agents or employees of Health Advantage. Neither Health Advantage nor any employee of Health Advantage is an employee or agent of In-Network Providers. Health Advantage shall not be liable for any claim or demand because of damages arising out of, or in any manner connected with, any injuries suffered by the Member while receiving care from any In - Network Provider. 12. Scope of Provider Payment - Global Payment . Health Advantage's payment to a Provider for their services as described in a Current Procedural Terminology (\"CPT\") or Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (\"HCPCS\") code and reimbursed in accordance with the Resour ce- Based Relative Value System (\"RBRVS\") used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") is an all -inclusive, global payment that covers all elements of the service as described in the particular code billed. This means that whatever staffing , overhead costs, equipment, drugs, machinery, tools, technology, supplies, or materials of any kind that may be required in order for the billing Provider to perform the service or treatment described in the CPT or HCPCS code billed, Health Advantage's pa yment to the billing Provider of the Allowance or Allowable Charge for that CPT or HCPCS code constitutes the entire payment and the limit of benefits under this Evidence of Coverage with respect to the CPT or HCPCS code billed. A Provider who bills for a particular CPT or HCPCS code is deemed to represent that the billing Provider has performed and is responsible for provision of all services or treatments described in the CPT or HCPCS code, and is entitled to bill for such services or treatments. If Heal th Advantage pays for a Covered Service by applying the Allowance or Allowable Charge to the bill of a Provider who represents that the Provider has performed a service or treatment described in a CPT or HCPCS code as submitted to Health Advantage, Health Advantage shall have no further obligation, nor is there coverage under this Evidence of Coverage, for bills from or payment to any other provider, entity or person, regardless of whether they assisted the billing Provider or furnished any staffing, equipm ent, drugs, machinery, tools, technology, supplies or materials of any kind to or for the benefit of the billing Provider. In other words, benefits under this Evidence of Coverage are limited to one, global payment for all components of any services falli ng within the scope of any CPT or HCPCS code service or treatment description, and Health Advantage will make only one payment with respect to such CPT 43 or HCPCS code, even if multiple parties claim to have contributed a portion of the staffing, equipment, machinery, tools, technology, supplies or materials used by the billing Provider in the course of providing the service or treatment described in the CPT or HCPCS code. For example, a physician who performs certain surgical procedures in the physician's o ffice might choose to engage an equipment and supply company to set up the surgical table, furnish an assisting nurse, and also furnish certain surgical instruments, devices or supplies used by the physician. When the physician bills Health Advantage for t he physician's performance of the surgical procedure described in a specific CPT or HCPCS code, Health Advantage will make a single, global payment to the physician for Covered Services described in the CPT or HCPCS code, and will not be obligated to pay f or any charges of the equipment and supply company. In such circumstances, any charge or claim of payment due the equipment and supply company shall be the exclusive responsibility of the physician (or other provider) who engaged the equipment and supply company, and permitted or facilitated such company's access to the physician's patient. In any event, as noted above, no benefits are available under this Evidence of Coverage for any services, drugs, materials or supplies of the equipment and supply compa ny. It is Health Advantage's policy (and this Evidence of Coverage is specifically intended to adopt the same) that no benefits shall be paid for \"unbundled services\" in excess of Health Advantage's Allowance or Allowable Charge for any service as describ ed in the applicable CPT or HCPCS code. This means, for example, that if a physician and another category of provider (such as a durable medical equipment supplier, a laboratory, a nurse practitioner, a nurse, a physician's assistant or any other category of provider) agree together to divide up, split or \"unbundle\" the components of any CPT or HCPCS code, and attempt to bill separately for the various components each allegedly provides for the patient, benefits under this Evidence of Coverage shall neverth eless be limited to one Allowance per CPT or HCPCS code; in such circumstances, your benefits under this Evidence of Coverage will pay only one Allowance or Allowable Charge for any Covered Service described in any single CPT or HCPCS code, and the various providers involved in any such \"unbundling\" action or agreement must resolve among themselves any division of that single Allowance or Allowable Charge between or among them. You can protect yourself from the possibility of billing in excess of the Allowa nce or Allowable Charge in these circumstances by always inquiring in advance to be sure that each provider involved in your care or treatment is an In -Network Provider. Please note that Health Advantage makes the following exceptions to the preceding gen eral policy of one global payment (Allowance) per CPT or HCPCS code: (i) where CMS has developed and published an RBRVS policy that specifically recognizes that the Relative Value Units (RVUs) associated with a specific CPT or HCPCS code should be divided into both a professional and a technical component; or (ii) billing of the services of an assistant surgeon for those CPT or HCPCS codes that specifically recognize assistant surgery services as applicable; or (iii) billing of radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine procedures where such radiopharmaceuticals clearly are not included in the practice expense portion of the associated RVU as published and defined by CMS; or (iv) billing of a procedure or set of procedures that, per the applicable CPT or HCPCS code definition, is based solely on time consumed so that it is necessary to submit multiple units of the procedure in order to accurately report the total time devoted to the patient. In the specific four circumstances outlined in the preceding sent ence, Health Advantage will recognize and pay more than one Allowance per CPT or HCPCS code, provided all other terms and conditions of this Evidence of Coverage are met. With respect to the first such circumstance involving RVUs divided between a professi onal and a technical component, Health Advantage's payment will be limited to one global payment (Allowance) for the applicable professional component, and one global payment (Allowance) for the technical component. In other words, even where CMS policy sp ecifically recognizes division of an RVU into professional and technical components, Health Advantage will not be responsible for paying multiple providers or multiple billings for the professional component, nor will Health Advantage be responsible for pa ying multiple providers or multiple billings for the technical component. Benefits under this Evidence of Coverage will be limited in such circumstances to one global payment (Allowance) for the professional component and one global payment (Allowance) for the technical component. 44 5.2. Member's Financial Obligations for Allowance or Allowable Charges under the Plan 1. Deductible. For those covere d Health Interventions, which are specified in the Schedule of Benefits as being subject to a Deductible, each Contract Year, before the Plan makes a benefit payment, a Member must pay the cost of a Covered Service equal to the Annual Deductible Limitation specified in the Schedule of Benefits. If the Plan provides family coverage, once two family members have met their individual Deductible, no further Deductible will be required for the balance of the year, regardless of what member of the family incurs a claim. Deductible payments count toward the Annual Limitation on Cost Sharing specified in the Schedule of Benefits. 2. Coinsurance. Once the Deductible is satisfied, a Member is responsible for Coinsurance, which is a percentage of the Allowance or A llowable Charges paid, for claims incurred until the payment equals the Annual Limitation on Cost Sharing specified in the Schedule of Benefits. After the Annual Limitation on Cost Sharing is satisfied, subject to the provisions of Subsection 5.2.4. of this Evidence of Coverage, the Member will have no further responsibility with respect to Allowances or Allowable Charges incurred during the balance of the Contract Year. 3. Copayments. In order to receive certain Health Interventions from an In -Network Pr ovider, a Member may have to pay a Copayment, which is expressed as either a dollar amount or a percentage of the Allowance or Allowable Charge in the Schedule of Benefits. Copayments count toward the Annual Limitation on Cost Sharing specified in the Sch edule of Benefits. 4. Allowable Charges Not Applicable to Annual Limitation on Cost Sharing. No Allowance or Allowable Charges paid for services or supplies from Out -of-Network shall accumulate to or be impacted by the satisfaction of the Annual Deductibl e Limitation or the Annual Limitation on Cost Sharing, unless the Company determines that the Out -of-Network Provider should be treated as an In-Network Provider in accordance with one of the provisions listed in Subsection 5.1. 5. 5.3 Other Plans and Bene fit Programs 1. Coordination of Benefits. Coordination of Benefits (COB) applies when a Member has coverage under more than one Health Benefit Plan. Health Advantage may annually request that a Member verify the existence of other coverage. a. Definitions. For purposes of this Subsection 5.3 only, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings: i. \"Allowable Expenses\" means any necessary, reasonable and customary item of expens e at least a portion of which is covered under at least one of the Health Benefit Plans covering the person for whom claim is made. When a Health Benefit Plan provides benefits in the form of coverage for services, the reasonable cash value of each servic e rendered shall be deemed to be both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. ii. \"Health Benefit Plan\" means any of the following which provide coverage for medical care or treatment: (1) Coverage under government programs, including Medicare, required o r provided by any statute unless coordination of benefits with any such program is forbidden by law. (2) Group coverage or any other arrangement of coverage for individuals in a group whether on an insured or uninsured basis, including health maintenance o rganization or other form of group coverage; Hospital indemnity benefits in excess of $200 per day; medical care components of group long -term care contracts; and medical benefits under group or individual automobile contracts. (3) An individually underwri tten accident and health insurance policy which reduces benefits because of the existence of other insurance. (4) Coverage under any automobile insurance policy, including but not limited to medical payment, personal injury protection or no -fault benefits. The term \"Health Benefit Plan\" shall be construed separately with respect to: (1) Each Policy, contract or other arrangement for benefits or services. 45 (2) That portion of any such Policy, contract or other arrangement which reserves the right to take the benefits of other Health Benefit Plans into consideration in determining its benefits and that portion which does not. b. Health Advantage shall have the right to coordinate benefits between this Plan and any other Health Benefit Plan covering a Member . The rules establishing the order of benefit determination between this Evidence of Coverage and any other Health Benefit Plan covering the Member on whose behalf a claim is made are as follows: i. The benefits of a Health Benefit Plan which does not have a \" coordination of benefits with other health plans\" provision shall in all cases be determined and applied to claims before the benefits of this Evidence of Coverage . ii. If according to the rules set forth in Subsection c. of this Section, the benefits of another Health Benefit Plan that contains a provision coordinating its benefits with this Plan would be determined and applied, before the benefits of this Plan have been determined and applied, the benefits of such other Health Benefit Plan will be conside red before the determination of benefits under this Plan. iii. Under no circumstances shall benefits payable and paid under this Plan together with any other Health Benefit Plans exceed the total charge for services a Member received. c. Order of Benefit Determination: The order of benefit determination as to a Member 's claim shall be as follows: i. Non-Dependent or Dependent. The benefits of a plan which covers the person on whose expenses a claim is based other than as a dependent shall be determined an d applied before the benefits of a plan which covers such person as a dependent. (By way of example only, if one Plan [Plan A] covers a person as a Policyholder or a Subscriber and the other plan covers the person as a dependent of a Policyholder or of a Su bscriber [Plan B], then Plan A is deemed \"primary\" and Plan A's benefits will be applied and paid before any consideration of Plan B.) ii. Child Covered Under More Than One Plan. When the parents of a dependent child are married, the benefits of a plan wh ich covers the person on whose expenses a claim is based as a dependent child of a person whose date of birth, excluding year of birth, occurs earlier in a Contract Year , shall be determined before the benefits of a plan which covers such person as a depen dent child of a person whose date of birth, excluding year of birth, occurs later in a Contract Year . If the other plan does not have the provisions of this paragraph regarding coverage of dependent children of married parents, or if both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered either of the parents longer is primary. The following rules apply to determine the order of benefit determination for a dependent child of parents who are separated or divorced: (1) When the parents are separated or divorced and there is a court decree which fixes financial responsibility on one of the parents for the medical, dental, or other health care expenses with respect to the child, the benefits of a plan which covers the child as a dependent of the parent with such financial responsibility shall be determined before the benefits of any other plan which covers the child as a dependent child. (2) When the parents are separated or divorced and the parent with custody of the child has not remarried, if there is no court decree fixing financial responsibility on one of the parents for the medical, dental or other health care expense with respect to the child, the benefits of a plan which covers the child as a dependent of the parent with custody of the child will be determined before the benefits of a plan which covers the child as a dependent of the parent without custody. (3) When the parents are divorced and the parent with custody of the child has remarried, if there is no court decree fixing financial respons ibility on one 46 parent for the medical, dental or other health care expense with respect to the child, the benefits of a plan which covers the child as a dependent of the parent with custody shall be determined before the benefits of a plan which covers tha t child as a dependent of the step -parent, and the benefits of a plan which covers that child as a dependent of the step -parent will be determined before the benefits of a plan which covers that child as a dependent of the parent without custody. iii. Active or Inactive Employee. When paragraphs (i) or (ii) above do not apply so as to establish an order of benefits determination, the plan that covers a person as a Subscriber who is neither laid off nor retired, is primary. The same would hold true if a pe rson is a dependent of a person covered as a retiree and a Subscriber . If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Coverage provided to an individual as a retired worker and as a dependent of an actively working spouse will be determined under the rule set out in paragraph (i) above. iv. Continuation coverage. When paragraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) above do not apply so as to establish an order of benefits determinatio n, if a person whose coverage is provided under a right of continuation provided by federal or state law also is covered under another plan, the plan covering the person as a an employee , Member , Subscriber policyholder or retiree (or as that person's depen dent) is primary, and the continuation coverage is secondary. If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. v. Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage. When paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above do not apply so as to establish an order of benefits determination, the plan that covered the person as an employee , policyholder, Member , Subscriber or retiree longer is primary. vi. If the preceding rules do not determine t he primary plan, the allowable expenses shall be shared equally between the plans meeting the definition of health benefit plan, Subsection 5.3.1.a.(ii). In addition, this plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been primary. 2. Medicare, Mi litary or Government Benefits. If a Member is a Medicare beneficiary, benefits will be determined in accordance with the Medicare Secondary Payer rules. Services and benefits for treatment of military service -connected disabilities to which a Member is legally entitled from a military or government benefit plan shall in all cases be provided before the benefits of this Evidence of Coverage . 3. Workers' Compensation. There are no benefits under this Evidence of Coverage for treatment of any injury which will sustain a claim for damages from Workers' Compensation. This regardless of whether or not the Member filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits. Health Advantage will presume that if the Member makes a claim for worker's compensation benefits, the injury for which the Member makes any such claim is an injury which will sustain a claim for damages under the Workers' Compensation Law. Therefore, Health Advantage will not be liable for payment of any benefits as to such a claim, unless the full Wo rkers' Compensation Commission finds that the Member 's injury was not a compensable injury; and, the finding is not overturned on appeal. The foregoing presumption of non -coverage under this Evidence of Coverage also applies to any case in which the Membe r's workers' compensation benefits claim is settled by joint petition or otherwise. In this case, no benefits will be paid under this Evidence of Coverage with respect to such a claim, regardless of the settlement amount. Nor will Health Advantage pay bene fits for injury or illness for which the Member receives any benefits under the Workers' Compensation Law, state or federal workers' compensation, employer's liability or occupational disease law, or motor vehicle no -fault law, regardless of any limitation s in scope or coverage amount which may apply to the Member 's benefits claim under such laws. In the event that Health Advantage pays any claim by the Member for benefits under this Evidence of Coverage , and subsequently learns that the Member has filed a claim for workers' compensation 47 benefits as to such claim, or that the Member has settled a workers' compensation claim with any workers' compensation carrier, or has otherwise received any amount toward payment of such a claim under the Workers' Compensat ion Law, state or federal workers' compensation, employer's liability or occupational disease law, or motor vehicle no -fault law, the Member agrees to reimburse Health Advantage to the full extent of its payments on such claim. 4. Acts of Third Parties (Su brogation/Reimbursement). If a Member is injured by a third party, Health Advantage is subrogated to all rights the Member may have against any party liable for payment of medical treatment (including any and all insurance carriers) to the extent of payme nt for the services or benefits provided. The Member must cooperate fully with Health Advantage in its efforts to collect from the third party. See Subsection 5.3.5. The Member must cooperate fully with Health Advantage in its efforts to collect from the third party. Health Advantage may assert its subrogation rights independently of the Member . In addition to the above -referenced subrogation rights, Health Advantage also has reimbursement rights should the Member , or the legal representative, estate or heirs of the Member recover damages by settlement, verdict or otherwise, for an accident, injury or illness. If a recovery is made, the Member shall promptly reimburse the Plan any monetary recovery made by the Member and includes, but is not limited to, uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, any no -fault insurance, medical payments coverage, direct recoveries from liable parties, or any other source. 5. Member 's Cooperation. Each Member shall complete and submit to Health Advantage such consents, releases, assignments and other documents as may be requested by Health Advantage in order to obtain or assure reimbursement from other health benefit plan(s), from Medicare, from Workers' Compensation, or through subrogation.

The actions, determinations and interpretations of Health Advantage acting on behalf of the Plan with respect to all such matters, and with respect to any matter within the scope of its authority, shall be conclusive and binding on you and the Plan. In reviewing a claim for benefits, Health Advantage will apply the terms, conditions, exclusions and limitations of the Plan set out in this Evidence of Coverage, including but not limited to the Primary Coverage Criteria, Section 2.0; the specific limitations of the Plan, Section 3.0; the specific plan exclusions, Section 4.0; the cost sharing and Provider network procedures of the Plan, Section 5.0; and the eligibility standards of the Plan, Section 6.0. This Section 7 sets out the procedures you must follow in submitting a request for coverage, called a \"claim for benefits\" or a \"claim,\" with your Plan, Subsection 7.1. The section describes procedures you must follow to file oral or written complaints, Subsection 7.2. The section also describes your rights to appeal if a claim for benefits is denied either in whole or in part, Subsections 7.3 and 7.4. Finally, this section sets out how you may have an Authorized Representative to represent you in submitting claims or appeals, Subsection 7.5. 7.1 Claim Processing. 1. Claim for Benefits. \"Claim for benefits\" means (1) a request for payment for a service, supply, medication, equipment or treatment c overed by the Plan or (2) a request for Prior Approval for a service, supply, medication, test, equipment or treatment covered by the Plan where the Plan conditions receipt of payment for such service, supply, medication, equipment or treatment on approval in advance by Health Advantage. 2. Who May Submit a Claim. A Member, a Provider with an assignment of the claim that is approved by Health Advantage or the Member's Authorized Representative may submit a claim. See Subsection 7.5 below concerning the Authorized Representative. 3. Classifications of Claims. There are four general types of claims for benefits possible under the Plan. The type of claim involved affects the procedures for filing the claim and the timing of the benefit determination by He alth Advantage. a. Post -Service Claims. The most common claim involves post -service benefit determination. Such a claim results when a Member obtains a medical service, medication, supply, test, equipment or other treatment and then, in accordance with t he terms of the Plan, the Member or the Member's Authorized Representative submits a claim for benefits to Health Advantage. Examples of post -service claims are claims involving physician office visits, maternity care, outpatient services, and most medica tions obtained through a managed pharmacy benefit. You must submit written proof of any service, supply, medication, test, equipment or other treatment within 180 days after such service, supply, medication, test, equipment or treatment was received. In t he case of a claim for inpatient services for multiple 55 consecutive days, the written proof must be submitted no later than 180 days following your date of discharge for that single admission. Post-Service Claims may be submitted electronically in accordanc e with Health Advantage's electronic claim filing procedures, or such claims may be mailed to Health Advantage Claims Division, Post Office Box 8069, Little Rock, Arkansas 72203. If you fail to disclose your coverage under this Evidence of Coverage which causes the claim to not be filed timely by the Provider of service, you will be fully responsible for charges for services from the Provider. If Health Advantage is able to process your post -service claim without requesting additional information, it will notify you of its claim determination within 30 days of Health Advantage's receipt of the claim. Health Advantage will forward any payment resulting from the claim determination within 45 days (30 days if the claim is submitted electronically) of Health Advantage's receipt of the claim. If Health Advantage requires information reasonably necessary to determine whether or to what extent benefits are covered under the Plan, as specified in Subsection 7.1.4. below, Health Advantage will suspend the claim and request the needed information. If you or your treating Provider supplies Health Advantage the required information within ninety (90) days of the claim suspension, Health Advantage will notify you of its claim determination within 15 days after Health Ad vantage receives such information. Health Advantage will forward any payment resulting from the claim determination within 30 days of Health Advantage's receipt of the required information. If Health Advantage does not receive the required information wi thin the 90 -day period, 15 days later, the suspended claim becomes a denied claim, subject to appeal. See Subsection 7.3 Claim Appeals to the Plan. b. Pre-Service Claims. The terms of the Plan condition receipt of certain benefits on Health Advantage giv ing approval in advance of the Member obtaining a requested medical service, drug, supply, test or equipment that such medical service, drug, supply, test or equipment meets Primary Coverage Criteria . Examples of some Plan benefits requiring pre-service c laims include, but are not limited to claims for Hospital and anesthesia services for dental procedures, Subsection 3.3.3; for Advanced Diagnostic Imaging services, Subsection 3.6; Specialty Medications, Subsection 3.2 3; for 3. 34.6. Please note that prior approval does not guarantee payment or assure coverage; it means only that the information furnished to He alth Advantage at the time indicates that the Health Intervention that is the subject of the pre -service claim meets the Primary Coverage Criteria. (See Section 2.0.) A claim receiving prior approval as a pre -service claim must still meet all other cover age terms, conditions, and limitations. Coverage for any such pre - service claim receiving prior approval may still be limited or denied if, when the claimed Intervention is completed and Health Advantage receives the post -service claim(s), investigation s hows that a benefit exclusion or limitation applies, that the Member ceased to be eligible for benefits on the date services were provided, that coverage lapsed for non -payment of premium, that out -of-network limitations apply, or any other basis specified in this Evidence of Coverage applies to limit or exclude the claim. Pre-service claims should be submitted to the Health Advantage Medical Audit and Review Services, FAX (501) 378 -6647 or mailed to Post Office Box 3688, Little Rock, Arkansas 72203. If He alth Advantage is able to process your pre -service claim without requesting additional information, it will notify you of its determination in a time appropriate for the medical exigencies, but in no case later than 15 days from the date it received the pr e- service claim. If Health Advantage requires information reasonably necessary to determine whether the requested medical service, drug, supply, test or equipment meets the Primary Coverage Criteria under the Plan, Health Advantage will suspend the claim and request the needed information. If you or your treating Provider supplies Health Advantage the required 56 information within ninety (90) days of the claim suspension, Health Advantage will notify you of its claim determination within 15 days after Heal th Advantage receives such information. If Health Advantage does not receive the required information within the 90 - day period, 15 days later, the suspended claim will become a denied claim, subject to appeal. See Subsection 7.3. Claim Appeals to the Pla n. After you have received the Health Intervention that was the subject of an approved pre - service claim, you must submit a post -service claim in accordance with Subsection 7.1.3.a., above. c. Claims Involving Urgent Care. A claim involving urgent care mu st be a pre -service claim (See Subsection 7.1.3.b. above) for which a health care professional with knowledge of the claimant's condition certifies that the processing of the claim in the time period for making a non-urgent pre -service claim determination (1) could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the claimant or the ability of the claimant to maintain or regain maximum function, or (2) would subject the claimant to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that i s the subject of the claim. A claim involving urgent care must be submitted in writing, via mail, facsimile or e -mail, in a format authorized by Health Advantage's claim filing procedures. A claim involving urgent care must include the medical records pe rtinent to the urgent condition. If Health Advantage is able to process your claim involving urgent care without requesting additional information, it will notify you of its determination in a time appropriate for the medical exigencies, but in no case lat er than 72 hours from the date it received the pre - service claim. If Health Advantage requires information reasonably necessary to determine whether the requested medical service, drug, supply, test or equipment meets the Primary Coverage Criteria under th e Plan, Health Advantage will notify your physician within 24 hours of receiving the claim and request the needed information. If you or your treating Provider supplies Health Advantage the required information within 48 hours, Health Advantage will notify you of its claim determination within 48 hours after Health Advantage receives such information. If Health Advantage does not receive the required information within the 48 - hour period, the claim will be denied, subject to appeal. See Subsection 7.3 Cl aim Appeals to the Plan . If the urgent care claim is a request to extend previously approved benefit for ongoing treatment, Health Advantage shall make a determination within 24 hours after receipt of the claim, provided the claim is received at least 24 hours prior to the expiration of the previously approved benefit. Please note that approval of a claim involving urgent care does not guarantee payment or assure coverage; it means only that the information furnished to Health Advantage at the time indicat es that the Health Intervention that is the subject of the claim involving urgent care meets the Primary Coverage Criteria. A Health Intervention receiving prior approval as a claim involving urgent care, must still meet all other coverage terms, conditio ns, and limitations. Coverage for any such claim may still be limited or denied if, when the claimed Intervention is completed and Health Advantage receives the post -service claim(s), investigation shows that a benefit exclusion or limitation applies, tha t the Member ceased to be eligible for benefits on the date services were provided, that coverage lapsed for non -payment of premium, that out -of-network limitations apply, or any other basis specified in this Evidence of Coverage applies to limit or exclud e the claim. After you have received the Health Intervention that was the subject of a claim involving urgent care, you must submit a post -service claim in accordance with Subsection 7.1.3.a., above. d. Claims involving Ongoing Care or Concurrent Review. Health Advantage's termination or reduction of a previously granted benefit under the Plan (other than by Plan amendment or termination) results in a claim involving ongoing care or concurrent review. Health Advantage shall give an explanation of the redu ction or termination of a benefit to the Member, as specified in Subsection 7.1.6, with sufficient time prior to the termination or 57 reduction to allow for an appeal under Subsection 7.3.8.d. to be completed before the termination or reduction takes place. 4. Information Reasonably Necessary to Process a Claim. a. In order to be a claim, the submission must comply with the filing and coding polices and procedures established by Health Advantage. You may request a copy of the claim coding policies and pro cedures from Health Advantage or from your Provider. If the submission fails to comply with the claim filing or code policies or procedures, Health Advantage shall return the submission to the person that submitted it. If the claim involved is a pre -service claim, the submission shall be returned as soon as possible, but no later than 5 days (24 hours for a claim involving urgent care), and Health Advantage shall indicate on the returned submission the proper procedures to be followed. b. In addition to the claim completed in accordance with Health Advantage's claim filing procedures, depending upon the service, supply, medication, equipment or treatment that is the subject of the claim, Health Advantage may require one or more of the following items of information to enable Health Advantage to determine whether or to what extent the claimed benefit is covered by the Plan: i. Information in order to determine if a limitation or exclusion of the Plan is applicable to the claim, or ii. Medical information in order to determine the price for a medical procedure, or iii. Information in order to determine if the Member who received the claimed services is eligible under the terms of the Plan, or iv. Information in order to determine if the claim is covered by an other health benefit plan, workers' compensation, a government supported program, or a liable third party, or v. Information in order to determine the obligation of each health benefit plan or government program under coordination of benefits rules, or vi. Information in order to determine if there has been fraud or a fraudulent or material misrepresentation with respect to the claim. 5. Member's Responsibility with Respect to Claim Information. Before any benefits can be paid, you agree, as a condition o f coverage under the Plan, to authorize and direct any Provider of medical services or supplies to furnish to Health Advantage, its agents, or any of its affiliates, upon request, all records, or copies thereof, relating to such services or supplies. Furt her, as a condition of your coverage, you agree to authorize the release of such records to any third party review person or entity, for purposes of medical review or second opinion surgery. Finally, as a condition of coverage, you agree to fully and trut hfully respond to inquiries from Health Advantage about your claim or condition, including, but not limited to, your other, health benefit coverage, insurance coverage, third party liability, or workers' compensation benefits and to request that any Physic ian or other Provider respond to all such inquiries. You understand and agree that your failure to respond to inquiries from Health Advantage or failure to cooperate fully to obtain information requested by Health Advantage from your Physician or other he alth care Provider shall be, by itself, grounds for denial of benefits under the Plan. 6. Explanation of Benefit Determination. Upon making a determination of a claim, Health Advantage will deliver to you the following information: a. The specific reason or reasons for the determination with information sufficient to identify the claim involved (including the date of service, the health care provider, the claim amount and a way that the Member may learn the diagnosis and treatment codes and their descripti ons); b. Reference to the specific plan provision(s) on which the determination is based; c. A description of any additional information necessary for the claim to be perfected and an explanation of why such information is necessary; d. A description of th e Plan's appeal process, see Subsection 7.3 below. If the claim involves urgent care, a description of the expedited appeals process, see Subsection 7.3.10. below. 58 e. If the determination was based in whole or in part on a Health Advantage Coverage Policy an explanation of how to obtain a copy of the Coverage Policy at no cost. See Subsection 2.4.1.f. above. 7. Informal Claim Review. If you have questions about an Explanation of Benefit Determination, you may contact Customer Service (Telephone toll free (800) 843 -1329, or write Health Advantage, Customer Service, Post Office Box 8069, Little Rock, Arkansas 72203) and ask that the determination be reviewed. Customer Service will respond in like manner with answers to your request. This informal review i s not an Appeal (see Subsection 7.3 below) nor a substitute for an appeal. Nor must you ask for an informal review in order to request an appeal. 8. Benefit Inquiries. From time to time you or your Provider may want an indication whether a service, suppl y, medication, equipment or treatment is an eligible benefit of the Plan. You may make a benefit inquiry to Health Advantage Customer Service Division, Post Office Box 8069, Little Rock, Arkansas 72203, or by Telephone to toll free (800) 843 -1329. a. A be nefit inquiry is not a claim. You should understand that a benefit inquiry is different from a pre -service claim. In the case of a benefit inquiry the Plan does not specify that receipt of the benefit in question is conditioned upon Prior Approval of Hea lth Advantage (see Subsection 7.1.3.b Pre -Service Claims, above). b. Health Advantage's response to a benefit inquiry is not a guarantee of payment. Health Advantage's ultimate determination of a claim will be based upon the relevant facts as applied to the terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions of the Plan. A benefit inquiry is not a claim. Health Advantage's response to a benefit inquiry is not a claim determination. Health Advantage's response is based upon the information available to Health Advantage at the time of the inquiry and such information may not be current or accurate. Health Advantage reserves the right to make a final determination of the post - service claim resulting from a Health Intervention that may have been the subject of a benefit inquiry after the Intervention has been completed and all relevant facts are known. c. A benefit inquiry is not subject to appeal. 9. Member's Responsibility with Respect to Erroneous Claim Payments. Despite our best efforts, we may make a claim payment which is not for a benefit provided under the Plan, or we may make payment to you when payment should have gone directly to the Provider of treatment or services instead. In the event of an erroneous or mistaken payment, you agree to refund the fu ll amount of such payment to us promptly upon our request. If Health Advantage does not receive the full amount of the refund due, Health Advantage will have the right to offset future payments made to you or your Provider under this Policy/ Evidence of C overage or under any other Policy/Evidence of Coverage you have with Health Advantage now or in the future. 10. Out-of-Arkansas Services We have a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans and their Licensed Controlled Affilia tes (\"Licensees\") referred to generally as \"Inter -Plan Programs.\" Whenever you obtain healthcare services outside of our service area, the State of Arkansas, the claims for these services may be processed through one of these Inter -Plan Programs. Typically , when accessing care outside our service area, you will obtain care from healthcare providers that have a contractual agreement (i.e., are \"participating providers\") with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area (\"Hos t Blue\"). In some instances, you may obtain care from non -participating healthcare providers. Our payment practices in both instances are described below. We cover only limited healthcare services received outside of our service area. As used in this Subsection, 7.1.10 \"Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services\" include only emergency care or urgent care obtained outside the geographic area we serve. Any other services will not be covered when processed through any Inter -Plan Programs arrangements. These \"o ther services\" must be provided or authorized by your primary care physician (\"PCP\"). a. BlueCard\u00ae Program i. Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, when you obtain Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, we will remain responsible for fulfilling our contractual obligations. However the Host Blue is 59 responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its participating healthcare providers. ii. The BlueCard Program enables you to obtain Out -of-Area Cov ered Healthcare Services, as defined above, from a healthcare provider participating with a Host Blue, where available. The participating healthcare provider will automatically file a claim for the Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services provided to you, s o there are no claim forms for you to fill out. You will be responsible for the member copayment amount, as stated in your Evidence of Coverage. b. Emergency Care Services: If you experience a Medical Emergency while traveling outside the Health Advantage se rvice area, go to the nearest Emergency or Urgent Care facility. Whenever you access covered healthcare services outside our service area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay for covered healthcare services, if not a flat dollar copayment, is calculated based on the lower of: The billed covered charges for your covered services; or The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to us. i. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an a ctual price that the Host Blue pays to your healthcare provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with your healthcare provider or provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive payments, and /or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of healthcare providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated pri ce. ii. Estimated pricing and average pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct for over - or underestimation of modifications of past pricing for the types of transaction modifications noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price we use for your claim because they will not be applied retroactively to claims already paid. iii. Laws in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to add a surcharge to your calculation. If any state laws mandate other liability calc ulation methods, including a surcharge, we would then calculate your liability for any covered healthcare services according to applicable law. c. Non-Participating Healthcare Providers Outside of Our Service Area, the State of Arkansas i. Your Liability C alculation. When Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services are received from non -participating healthcare providers, the amount you pay for such services will generally be based on either the Host Blue's non -participating healthcare provider local payment o r the pricing arrangements required by applicable state law. In these situations, you will be liable for the difference between the amount that the non -participating healthcare provider bills and the payment we will make for the covered services as set fo rth in this Evidence of Coverage. ii. Exceptions. In certain situations, we may use other payment bases, such as a billed covered charges, the payment we would make if the healthcare services had been obtained within our service area, or a special negotia ted payment, as permitted under the Inter -Plan Programs Policies, to determine the amount we will pay for services rendered by nonparticipating healthcare providers. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the non - participating healthcare provider bills and the payment we will make for the covered services as set forth in this Evidence of Coverage. 7.2 Complaints 1. Definition. A complaint is an expression of dissatisfaction abo ut Health Advantage. 2. Oral Complaints. A Member having a complaint regarding any aspect of Health Advantage may contact a Customer Service Representative toll free at 1 -800-843-1329 who will assist in resolving 60 the matter informally. If the Member is n ot satisfied with the resolution, a written complaint may be submitted. A Member is not required to make an oral complaint prior to submitting a written complaint. 3. Written Complaints. Health Advantage will acknowledge receipt of a written complaint wit hin 5 working days. Health Advantage will investigate the complaint and send the Member a response with resolution. If Health Advantage is unable to resolve the written complaint within 30 calendar days due to circumstances beyond its control, Health Adv antage will provide notice of the reason for the delay before the 30th calendar day. 7.3 Claim Appeals to the Plan (Internal Review). 1. Legal Actions . Prior to initiating legal action, you must file an appeal of your claim in accordance with this Subsection 7.3. No legal action shall be brought after the expiration of three (3) years from the time that a claim is required to be submitted. 2. Who May Request a Review.

Health Advantage provides two levels of review. a. First Level Review. The First Level Reviewer, a person located at the Health Advantage, cond ucts the first level review. b. Second Level Review.

The request for a second level appeal must be made within 60 days after you have been notified of the result of the first level review. The Second Level Appeal Committee, a committee that meets at the Health Advantage Office located at 320 West Capitol Avenue, Suite 300, Little Rock, Arkansas, conducts the second level review. You have a right to appear in person or attend via teleconference to supplement the written appeal and respond to the Second Level Appeal Committee's questions. 6. Documentation. a. Written Appeals.

The Appeals Reviewer shall conduct a complete review of all information relating to the claim and shall not afford deference to the initial claim determination in conduc ting the review. b.

The purpose of this Section 8.0 is to provide Members information about the incentive arrangements between Health Advantage and In -Network Physicians. 8.1 Definitions . The following definitions are used in this Section 8.0: 1. \"Negotiated Fee -For-Service\" means a pre -determined amount for each service an In -Network Provide r provides. In -Network Providers and Health Advantage agree to the Negotiated Fee -For- Service. This amount may be different from the amount the In -Network Provider usually receives from other payers. 2. \"Capitation\" means a set dollar payment per patient per unit of time (usually per month) paid to a Physician to cover a specified set of services and administrative costs without regard to the actual number of services provided. Services to which Capitation may be applied include a Physician's own service s, referral services and other services. At present, Health Advantage Capitation is limited to services provided directly by In -Network Physicians, i.e. there is no Capitation for referral services. 3. \"Medical Trends\" means the percentage increase or de crease in total medical claims (excluding pharmacy claims) received by Health Advantage in a given year, as compared to the previous year, actuarially adjusted for changes in benefits and sex/age ratios. 8.2 Health Advantage In -Network Provider Incentives. Health Advantage pays providers using both Capitation and Negotiated Fee -For-Service arrangements. At the end of each year, if medical costs are below what was budgeted by agreemen t between Health Advantage and participating In -Network Providers, then Health Advantage, In -Network Physicians and In -Network Hospitals share in the surplus, based upon a settlement formula described in the applicable provider contracts. 8.3 Individual Ph ysician's Incentives Not Tied to Referral Practices. An individual In -Network Physician does not make or lose money under his or her contract with Health Advantage b ased upon referral practices. Referral practices are evaluated as part of an overall reimbursement plan for groups of In - Network Physicians, and thus, referral practices could indirectly affect the level of reimbursement for a group of In -Network Physicia ns in some cases. For example, if, as a group, all In -Network Physicians in a given geographic area have fewer expenses than expected, they may share in any surplus amount. If, however, the In -Network Physicians incur more expense than the budgeted amoun t, they are not required to \"make up\" the difference; Health Advantage would absorb this loss. 8.4 Medical Trends Physician Incentives. In some parts of Arkansas, but not necessarily in the wh ole State, Health Advantage may offer incentives to encourage Physicians to practice medicine in a cost -effective manner. Physicians located in part of the Service Area may be entitled to incentive payments in the event that Medical Trends for that part o f the Service Area are lower than Medical Trends for the Service Area as a whole for a given year. The incentive payments will be calculated based on a percentage of the total medical claims received from the Physicians practicing in that part of the Serv ice Area and will reflect the lower Medical Trends for that part of the Service Area. 8.5 Incentive Arrangements Subject to Change. The incentive arrangements described here concern the provider contracts in place and regularly used by Health Advantage at the time this Evidence of Coverage was issued. Because of the rapid pace of change in health care financing in today's marketplace, physician negotiating positions, regulatory changes, or other developments, the precise content of Health Advantage provider reimbursement and incentive plans may change significantly in the future. 8.6 Pharmacy Incentives . In some parts of the Service Area, but not necessarily in the whole Service Area, Health Advantage may offer incentives to encourage In -Network Physicians to inform and educate patients regarding the costs of Prescription Medications and, where appropriate in the physician's independent medical ju dgment, to write prescriptions for Prescription Medications listed as Second Tier on the Health Advantage Formulary or for Generic Medications (First Tier), in lieu of other Prescription Medications. Physicians will be encouraged to discuss available alte rnatives with their patients, including First Tier or Second Tier medications, use of which will reduce the patient's out -of-pocket costs for Copayments and/or Coinsurance. 67 8.7 For Further Information. You may ask your Physician's administrative staff about compensation methods, including incentives, which apply to the services provided by their Physician or request information from Health Advantage by writing to Health Advantage, Post Office Box 8069, Litt le Rock, Arkansas 72203. 9.0 OTHER PROVISIONS The following information is important in the administration of the Plan. 9.1 Assignment of Benefits. No assignment of benefits under this Evidence of Coverage shall be valid until approved and accepted by Health Advantage . Health Advantage reserves the right to make payment of benefits, in its sole discretion, directly to the Provider of service or to you. 9.2 Right o f Rescission. The performance of an act or practice constituting fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact may be used by Health Advantage as the basis for rescission of coverage of the Policyholde r, any Employee or any Dependents. Health Advantage must provide the Policyholder 30 days' advance written notice of its intent to rescind the Evidence of Coverage . 9.3 Claim Recoveries. There may be circumstance s in which Health Advantage recovers amounts paid as claims expense from a Provider of services, from a Member or from a third party. Such circumstances include rebates paid to Health Advantage by pharmaceutical manufacturers based upon amounts of claims paid by Health Advantage for certain specified pharmaceuticals, amounts recovered by Health Advantage from health care Providers or pharmaceutical manufacturers through certain legal actions instituted by Health Advantage relating to the claims expense of more than one Member , recoveries by Health Advantage of overpayments made to health care Providers or to Member s, and recoveries from other parties with whom Health Advantage contracts or otherwise relies upon for payment or pricing of claims. The followi ng rules govern Health Advantage 's actions with respect to such recoveries: 1. In the event that such a recovery relates to a claim paid more than two years before the recovery, no adjustment will be made to any Deductible or Coinsurance paid by a Member and Health Advantage shall be entitled to retain such recoveries for its own use. If the recovery relates to a claim paid within two years and is not otherwise addressed in this subsection, Deductibles and Coinsurance amounts for a Member will be adjusted if affected by the recovery. 2. Only recoveries made within two years of the date of the error by Health Advantage or overpayments to health care Providers or to Member s by Health Advantage will be applied for the purpose of group rating or divisible surp lus calculation, if applicable. The cost actually paid by Health Advantage to procure such recoveries will be treated as an administrative expense in considering group rating or divisible surplus, if applicable. 3. In the event Health Advantage receives from pharmaceutical manufacturers rebates based upon amounts of claims paid for certain specified pharmaceuticals, Health Advantage shall be entitled to retain such rebates for its own use, and no adjustments will be made to claims paid or to Deductibles o r Coinsurance amounts paid by a Member . 4. If a Member is no longer covered by Health Advantage at the time of any such recovery, regardless of the amount or of the time of such recovery, Health Advantage shall be entitled to retain such recovery for its o wn use. 5. If such recovery amounts cannot be attributed on an individual basis, because of having been paid as a lump sum settlement for less than the total amount of claims expense of Health Advantage or otherwise, no adjustments will be made to any Dedu ctible or Coinsurance amounts paid by the Member and Health Advantage shall be entitled to retain such recovery for its own use. 9.4 Amendment. Health Advantage reserves the right to change the benefits, conditions and p remiums covered under the Group Policy or Group Insurance Contract, including the terms of this Evidence of Coverage . If we do so, we will give thirty (30) days written notice to your Employer or its agent and the change will go into effect on the date fi xed in the notice. No agent or employee of Health Advantage may change or modify any benefit, term, condition, limitation or exclusion of this Evidence of Coverage . Any change or amendment must be in writing and signed by an officer of Health Advantage . 9.5 Physician Incentives. In some parts of Arkansas, but not necessarily in the whole State, Health Advantage may offer incentives to encourage Physicians to practice medicine in a cost -effective manner. Phys icians located in part of Arkansas may be entitled to incentive payments in the event that Medical 68 Trends for that part of Arkansas are lower than Medical Trends for the State as a whole for a given year. The incentive payments will be calculated based on a percentage of total medical claims received from the Physicians practicing in that part of Arkansas and will reflect the lower Medical Trends for that part of Arkansas. A Member may want to ask their Physician's administrative staff about compensation methods, including incentives, which apply to the services provided by their Physician. 10.0 GLOSSARY OF TERMS These are terms used in this Group Policy and Evidence of Coverage. 10.1 Accidental Injury is define d as bodily injury (other than intentionally self -inflicted injury) sustained by a Member while the coverage is in force, and which is the direct cause of the loss, independent of disease or bodily infirmity. Injury to a tooth or teeth while eating is not considered an Accidental Injury. 10.2 Advanced Diagnostic Imaging means Computed tomography scanning (\"CT SCAN\"), Magnetic Resonance positron emission tomography scans (\"PET SCAN\"). 10.3 Allowance or Allowable Charge, when used in connection with covered services or supplies delivered in Arkansas, will be the amount deemed by Health Advantage, in its sole discretion, to be reasonable. The Health Advantage customary allowance is the basic Allowance or Allowable Charge. However, the Allowance or Allowable Charge may vary, given the facts of the case and the opinion of Health Advantage's medical director. At the option of Health Advantage, Allowances or Allowable Charges for services or supplies re ceived out of Arkansas may be determined by the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan, See Subsection 7.1.10 dealing with Out of Arkansas Claims. See Subsection 3.2 4.4 with respect to Allowance or Allowable Charge for transplants. See Subsection 3.3.2 wi th respect to Allowance or Allowable Charge for Outpatient Surgery Centers. Please note that all benefits under this Evidence of Coverage are subject to and shall be paid only by reference to the Allowance or Allowable Charge as determined at the discreti on of Health Advantage. This means that regardless of how much your health care Provider may bill for a given service, the benefits under this Evidence of Coverage will be limited by the Allowance or Allowable Charge we establish. If you use an Health Adv antage -participating Provider, that Provider is obligated to accept our established rate as payment in full, and should only bill you for your Deductible, Coinsurance and any non -covered services; however, if you use a non-participating Provider, you will be responsible for all amounts billed in excess of the Health Advantage Allowance or Allowable Charge. The payment to a Provider for their services as described in a Current Procedural Terminology (\"CPT\") or Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (\"HCPC S\") code and reimbursed in accordance with the Resource -Based Relative Value System (\"RBRVS\") used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") is an all -inclusive, global payment that covers all elements of the service as described in the particular code billed. This means that whatever staffing, overhead costs, equipment, drugs, machinery, tools, technology, supplies, or materials of any kind that may be required in order for the billing Provider to perform the service or treatment described i n the CPT or HCPCS code billed, Health Advantage's payment to the billing Provider of the Allowance or Allowable Charge for that CPT or HCPCS code constitutes the entire payment and the limit of benefits under this Evidence of Coverage with respect to the CPT or HCPCS code billed. A Provider who bills for a particular CPT or HCPCS code is deemed to represent that the billing Provider has performed and is responsible for provision of all services or treatments described in the CPT or HCPCS code, and is entit led to bill for such services or treatments. If Health Advantage pays for a Covered Service by applying the Allowance or Allowable Charge to the bill of a Provider who represents that the Provider has performed a service or treatment described in a CPT or HCPCS code as submitted to Health Advantage, Health Advantage shall have no further obligation, nor is there coverage under this Evidence of Coverage, for bills from or payment to any other provider, entity or person, regardless of whether they assisted t he billing Provider or furnished any staffing, equipment, drugs, machinery, tools, technology, supplies or materials of any kind to or for the benefit of the billing Provider. In other words, benefits under this Evidence of Coverage are limited to one, glo bal payment for all components of any services falling within the scope of any CPT or HCPCS code service or treatment description, and Health Advantage will make only one payment with respect to such CPT or HCPCS code, even if multiple parties claim to hav e contributed a portion of the staffing, equipment, machinery, tools, technology, supplies or materials used by the billing Provider in the course of providing the service or treatment described in the 69 CPT or HCPCS code. For example, a physician who perfo rms certain surgical procedures in the physician's office might choose to engage an equipment and supply company to set up the surgical table, furnish an assisting nurse, and also furnish certain surgical instruments, devices or supplies used by the physic ian. When the physician bills Health Advantage for the physician's performance of the surgical procedure described in a specific CPT or HCPCS code, Health Advantage will make a single, global payment to the physician for Covered Services described in the C PT or HCPCS code, and will not be obligated to pay for any charges of the equipment and supply company. In such circumstances, any charge or claim of payment due the equipment and supply company shall be the exclusive responsibility of the physician (or o ther provider) who engaged the equipment and supply company, and permitted or facilitated such company's access to the physician's patient. In any event, as noted above, no benefits are available under this Evidence of Coverage for any services, drugs, mat erials or supplies of the equipment and supply company. It is Health Advantage's policy (and this Evidence of Coverage is specifically intended to adopt the same) that no benefits shall be paid for \"unbundled services\" in excess of Health Advantage's Allo wance or Allowable Charge for any service as described in the applicable CPT or HCPCS code. This means, for example, that if a physician and another category of provider (such as a durable medical equipment supplier, a laboratory, a nurse practitioner, a n urse, a physician's assistant or any other category of provider) agree together to divide up, split or \"unbundle\" the components of any CPT or HCPCS code, and attempt to bill separately for the various components each allegedly provides for the patient, be nefits under this Evidence of Coverage shall nevertheless be limited to one Allowance per CPT or HCPCS code; in such circumstances, your benefits under this Evidence of Coverage will pay only one Allowance or Allowable Charge for any Covered Service descri bed in any single CPT or HCPCS code, and the various providers involved in any such \"unbundling\" action or agreement must resolve among themselves any division of that single Allowance or Allowable Charge between or among them. You can protect yourself fro m the possibility of billing in excess of the Allowance or Allowable Charge in these circumstances by always inquiring in advance to be sure that each provider involved in your care or treatment is an In -Network Provider. Please note that Health Advantage makes the following exceptions to the preceding general policy of one global payment (Allowance) per CPT or HCPCS code: (i) where CMS has developed and published an RBRVS policy that specifically recognizes that the Relative Value Units (RVUs) associated with a specific CPT or HCPCS code should be divided into both a professional and a technical component; or (ii) billing of the services of an assistant surgeon for those CPT or HCPCS codes that specifically recognize assistant surgery services as applicabl e; or (iii) billing of radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine procedures where such radiopharmaceuticals clearly are not included in the practice expense portion of the associated RVU as published and defined by CMS; or (iv) billing of a procedure o r set of procedures that, per the applicable CPT or HCPCS code definition, is based solely on time consumed so that it is necessary to submit multiple units of the procedure in order to accurately report the total time devoted to the patient. In the specif ic four circumstances outlined in the preceding sentence, Health Advantage will recognize and pay more than one Allowance per CPT or HCPCS code, provided all other terms and conditions of this Evidence of Coverage are met. With respect to the first such ci rcumstance involving RVUs divided between a professional and a technical component, Health Advantage's payment will be limited to one global payment (Allowance) for the applicable professional component, and one global payment (Allowance) for the technical component. In other words, even where CMS policy specifically recognizes division of an RVU into professional and technical components, Health Advantage will not be responsible for paying multiple providers or multiple billings for the professional compon ent, nor will Health Advantage be responsible for paying multiple providers or multiple billings for the technical component. Benefits under this Evidence of Coverage will be limited in such circumstances to one global payment (Allowance) for the professio nal component and one global payment (Allowance) for the technical component. 10.4 Ambulance Service means surface or air transportation in a regularly equipped ambulance licensed by an appropriate agency and where the use of any other means of transportat ion is not medically indicated.

High dose Chemotherapy is Chemotherapy several times higher than the standard dose for malignant disease (as determined in recognized med ical compendia) and which would automatically require the addition of drugs and procedures (e.g., Granulocyte Colony -Stimulating Factor, Granulocyte -Macrophage Colony -Stimulating Factor, re -infusion of cells, -infusion of autologous bone marrow tran splantation, or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation) in any patient who received this high dose Chemotherapy, to prevent life -threatening complications of the Chemotherapy on the patient's own progenitor blood cells. 10.11 Child means a Subscriber's nat ural Child, legally adopted Child or Stepchild. \"Child\" also means a Child that has been placed with the Subscriber for adoption. \"Child\" also means a Child for whom the Subscriber must provide medical support under a qualified medical child support orde r or for whom the Subscriber has been appointed the legal guardian. 10.12 Cognitive Rehabilitation means a treatment modality designed specifically for the remediation of disorders of perception, memory and language in brain -injured persons.

The Schedule of Benefits sets forth the Coinsurance for services or supplies received from an In -Network Provider and the Coinsurance for services and supplies from Out -of-Network Providers. NOTE: Because the contract betwee n Health Advantage and an In -Network Provider may include risk sharing arrangements that may involve a portion of the In -Network Provider's compensation or fees being withheld at the time the claim is paid the actual Coinsurance percentage for which a Memb er is responsible on any given claim may be higher than the percentages stated in the Schedule of Benefits. The actual Coinsurance percentage is dependent upon the year-end settlement or periodic adjustments between the In -Network Provider and Health Adva ntage. 10.14 Compound Medication means a non FDA approved medication prescribed by a Physician that is admixed by a pharmacist using multiple ingredients which may or may not be FDA approved individually. FDA 71 approved medications that exist as separate co mponents and are intended for reconstitution prior to administration are not Compound Medications. 10.15 Contract Holder means the Employer that established and maintains the Plan, as shown in the Application of the Group Enrollment Contract. 10.16 Contrac t Month means a month commencing on the first day of a calendar month and expiring on the last day of that calendar month or commencing on the fifteenth day of a month and expiring on the fourteenth day of the following month, depending upon the billing cy cle applied by Health Advantage. 10.17 Contract Year means the twelve consecutive month period commencing on the Group Contract effective date and ending on the day before the anniversary of that effective date. 10.18 Copayment means the amount required to be paid to an In -Network Provider by or on behalf of a Member in connection with Covered Services.
