On the other, was educated by the knowledge of his grandmother who introduced him to his secret herbal remedies. During a trip to Asia, Y-Nhi discovers that these remedies come from another medicine, called \" traditional \", based on the principle of body-mind balance. She then decides to train in Asia and in France within the Integrated Center of Chinese Medicine of La Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re. It is the synergy of these two sciences that is at the heart of each Ylo product. In 2015, Y-Nhi meets Laurent. Expert in \"selfcare\" health products, Laurent has explored both traditional and professional medicines, and is deeply convinced of their effectiveness. Y-Nhi and Laurent share the same desire to publicize the benefits of this millennial natural medicine and decide to launch their start-up together! How to treat yourself by acupressure? Born in China 3000 years ago, acupressure has spread to neighboring countries to give birth to different techniques. We think in particular of tsubo-shiatsu in Japan, the boom-huyet in Vietnam, or su-de-chim in Korea. Acupressure activates by pressure the \"acupoints\", specific areas on the body, called \"acupressure areas\" to harmonize the flows in the meridians and soothe disorders. Acupressure can be practiced by self-massage with the fingers or with acupressure instruments. There are in particular instruments made of metal, wood, horn, plastic, which allow better pressure, more precise, more regular and longer than the fingers. Unlike acupuncture, which is invasive and requires the intervention of a professional third party, acupressure on the skin can be done yourself. A natural alternative to herbal remedies in capsules Phyto-acupressure , although practiced in self-medication, is compatible with consultations with practitioners. By balancing the flow of the body, it allows better efficiency of consultations. By preparing the body and the mind, it increases and maintains the benefits of each consultation. It should be done calmly, while sitting, standing or lying down. It allows you to listen to your body because the acupressure areas are often sensitive depending on the disorders. Particularly effective in the management of everyday ailments such as sleep disorders, headaches, digestive disorders or nasal obstruction. Phyto-acupressure is the synergistic combination of two pillars of traditional Asian medicine, practiced on oneself. Save time by using the quick order form.
