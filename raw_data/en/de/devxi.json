As a parent or a caregiver of a child with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), you are now taking an important step: learning about these illnesses, how they're treated, and how you can help your child learn to live with their disease. The purpose of this brochure is to start you on that educational path\u2014to walk you through some key points about Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and what you may expect. The more you know, the better you'll be able to advocate for your child. Most importantly, you'll be armed with the knowledge and resources to be an active member of your child's healthcare team. The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation provides this information for educational purposes only, which is current as of the print date. We encourage you to review this educational material with your healthcare professional, as this informa-tion should not replace the recommendations and advice of your doctor.

Despite the challenges of living with a chronic illness, your child can have a happy, productive life. While there are not yet cures for these diseases, appropriate treatment can control the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of IBD. This can help achieve long-term treatment goals, including elimination of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, restoration of growth, and improved quality of life. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two most common types of IBD. While these conditions produce similar symptoms and may be treated with similar therapies, they are not the same. Crohn's disease may affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the anus. Unlike ulcer - ative colitis, Crohn's can skip large segments of bowel before reappearing in others. The areas most often affected are the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine (colon). In Crohn's patients, the inflammation does not stop at the mucosa (tissue lining) and may affect all layers of the bowel wall.

Ulcerative colitis also spreads proximally, mean-ing it starts from the rectum and can spread continuously to the rest of the large intestine. Signs and symptoms Despite the differences between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, both cause similar symptoms. Patients may have one or more symptoms, including: persistent diarrhea abdominal pain and/or cramps urgent bowel movements intestinal bleeding fever weight loss Beyond the intestines In addition to having symptoms in the GI tract, some people may experience a variety of symptoms associated with IBD in other parts of the body, known as extraintestinal mani-festations. Signs and symptoms of the disease may be evident in: eyes (redness, pain, and itchiness) mouth (sores) joints (swelling and pain) skin (tender bumps, painful ulcerations, and other sores/rashes) bones (osteoporosis) kidney (stones) liver (primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis, and cirrhosis)\u2014a rare development In some people, extraintestinal manifestations may be the first signs of IBD, appearing even years before the bowel symptoms. In others, 4 they may occur right before a flare-up of the disease. While most symptoms are the same in children and adults, children may additionally be affected by a delay in growth and puberty. In fact, a significant number of pediatric IBD patients are diagnosed after reporting growth delays. This primarily affects Crohn's patients because of direct effects on bone growth and decreased absorption of nutrients. However, it can affect all pediatric IBD patients if abdominal pain or other symptoms result in reduced appetite. It is important to understand that symptoms can vary significantly from patient to patient. Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic diseases, patients will go through periods where the disease flares up and causes symptoms. In between flares, people may experience no distress at all. These symptom- free periods (known as remission) can span months or even years, although symptoms typically do return at some point. You can learn more about signs and symptoms in the following brochures offered online at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org: Living with Crohn's Disease Living with Ulcerative Colitis Managing Flares and Other IBD Symptoms Causes of IBD No one knows for sure what causes Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Most experts believe there may be several factors that contribute to the development of these diseases, including: Genetics\u2014Researchers have discovered that IBD tends to run in families. In fact, data from recent studies demonstrate that the risk for developing IBD is between 1.5 and 28 percent 5 for first-degree relatives (i.e., parents, children, siblings) of a patient with IBD.1 More than 200 genes have now been associated with IBD, though their exact role is still under investigation. It's likely that a person inherits one or more genes that make him or her more susceptible to Crohn's disease. These genes then lead to an abnormal immune response to some environmental triggers. Scientists have not yet identified specific triggers but the bacteria in the intestine, part of our microbiome, are a leading candidate. Environmental elements\u2014Environmental factors likely play a role. In a genetically susceptible individual, whatever the trigger is, it prompts the person's immune system to \"turn on\" and launch an attack in the GI tract. That is when the inflammation begins. Inappropriate immune response\u2014Scientists continue to study whether defective signaling in a patient's immune system may result in an individual's immune system attacking their own GI tract. Though there is a lot that we don't fully understand about IBD, existing data has helped us to resolve some early concerns. We now know that there is no data to support the idea that tension, anxiety, or personality traits cause IBD. In addition, we know that these diseases are not contagious (like a cold or flu). Diagnosis Your child was diagnosed with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis after completing an ex - tended evaluation that likely included obtaining a thorough medical history; completion of a physical examination; laboratory studies, including blood testing; radiology studies; and an endoscopic evaluation of the upper and lower GI tract.6 Physicians generally begin by prescribing the least invasive tests, and may progress to more thorough testing until a diagnosis is obtained. Tests include: Stool tests to exclude infection or detect inflammation (fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin). Blood tests to check for a low red blood cell count (anemia) or high white blood cell count (suggestive of infection or inflammation). Blood tests may also detect the presence of abnormal antibodies and/or nutritional and vitamin deficiencies. Radiology studies to determine the extent of disease. Barium x-rays, CT scans, and MRI studies visualize areas of the small intestine that are out of reach of standard endoscopes (see next bullet). During a barium small bowel series, or CT scan, your child swallows a chalky liquid containing barium (or a similar material that coats the upper intestinal tract). Areas of swelling, narrowing, or other signs of intestinal inflammation can be identified with these imaging techniques. MRI studies typically use clear liquid contrast instead of barium. MRI studies provide great information without the need for radiation. However, this study requires patients to lie still for 45-60 minutes, and this can be difficult for some children. The goal will always be to limit your child's lifetime exposure to diagnostic radiation. Endoscopy is a test that involves inserting a lighted viewing tube/telescope through either the mouth into the upper intestine (upper endoscopy) or through the anus into the colon (colonoscopy). The physician per - forming the exam can also remove tiny pieces of tissue (biopsies) from the intestines, which can later be examined microscopically to assess for signs of allergy, infection, or inflammation. Another type of endoscopy, called wireless capsule or pill endoscopy, does not involve anesthesia. Instead, a patient 7 swallows a small pill-shaped camera, which takes pictures as it travels through the intestines. The images are captured on a device worn by the child. The camera pill is then excreted in the child's stool. As with all tests and procedures, there are rare risks involved that should be discussed with your child's doctor. Patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can present with symptoms observed in other common GI conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Like IBD, patients with IBS may experience symptoms including abdominal pain and diarrhea. However, it is believed that IBS does not involve inflammation of the lining of the small and large intestine. Instead, IBS is thought of as a functional bowel disorder in which the muscles of the intestines react improperly, either moving the bowel contents too quickly or too slowly. In some individuals, it can be difficult to deter - mine whether the symptoms and inflammation observed in patients with IBD are the result of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, even after extensive testing. In these cases, some patients are given a diagnosis of \"indeterminate colitis.\" Lighted scope can reach to the end of the small intestineColonSmall intestine Rectum AnusColonoscopy8 Disease overlap is more common in the young - est patients (those under six years old at the time of diagnosis). Very early onset IBD (VEO-IBD) is defined as IBD that occurs in children less than six years of age. Within this group of patients is a subset with infantile IBD, which is IBD that develops in children less than two years of age. Children with VEO-IBD often have severe symptoms that do not respond to standard treatments. Many children with VEO-IBD have a strong family history of IBD. Some also have under - lying immunodeficiencies, which can impact therapy. Researchers are working to identify causes and treatment options for VEO-IBD to improve quality of life for patients. For further information about diagnosing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, please read our brochure \"Diagnosing and Monitoring IBD\", available at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org. Treatment Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic, meaning that they are lasting inflammatory diseases that will present with increasing and decreasing symptoms, the goal of treatment is to relieve a patient's symptoms to improve overall quality of life, achieve and maintain clinical remission, and to prevent complications of the disease. There is no \"one size fits all\" treatment for IBD. Because each person with IBD is differ - ent, the treatment used to control their illness is unique. Doctors typically work to customize an individual's treatment plan, based on the type and severity of symptoms. There are effective treatments available that may help control your child's IBD.9 Prescription medication It is important to understand that just as the disease impacts each patient differently, there may be a need to change medication regimens over the course of an individual patient's disease. For example, a patient may have few symptoms and may respond well to low-dose drug therapy during one flare, but may require different, and stronger, medications during a more severe or prolonged flare. There are different categories of treatments used in the management of patients with IBD. These include: Aminosalicylates: These aspirin-like compounds contain 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and are used to treat mild-to- moderate active disease or to maintain disease remission. These drugs can be given either orally or rectally. They reduce inflam-mation in the intestine, similar to the manner in which aspirin works against inflammation in other parts of the body such as the joints (arthritis). Aminosalicylates do not suppress the immune system. Possible side effects of aminosalicylate therapy includes include diarrhea, headaches, and nausea. Corticosteroids: Potent anti-inflammatories, these medications work to keep a patient's immune system in check. Corticosteroids are used for children with moderate-to-severe IBD. Administered orally, rectally, or intrave-nously, steroids are effective for short-term management of flare-ups, helping to bring the disease under control. However, they are not recommended for longer-term treatment to maintain remission in children due to their potential unwanted side effects\u2014particularly at higher doses and longer duration\u2014 including, weight gain, sleep problems, mood swings, cognitive and memory changes, oste-oporosis, scalp hair loss or facial hair growth, acne, stretch marks, increased susceptibility of infection and bruising, and stunted growth. 10 To minimize the chance of osteoporosis, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is essential. Once remission is achieved, corti-costeroid dosage is tapered gradually. When patients are tapered off of corticosteroids, a strict schedule should be followed in order to minimize side effects that can occur if patients are weaned off too quickly. Immunomodulators: This class of medica- tions modifies the body's immune system so that it cannot contribute to ongoing inflam-mation. The approach to use of immunomod-ulators as a treatment in children can vary. Usually given orally, immunomodulators may often be prescribed as a combination therapy with biologics. They may also be used when aminosalicylates and corticosteroids haven't been effective, or only partially effective. This medication class can be useful in reducing or eliminating dependency on corticosteroids, and maintaining remission. All patients on immunomodulators need to be monitored closely for side effects, such as nausea, a decrease in white and red blood cell counts, as well as inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) or liver (hepatitis). There is an increased susceptibility to infection, and par - ticularly less common infections, in patients being treated with these medications. Also, there is a small but increased risk of develop-ing certain cancers, including nonmelanoma skin cancers and lymphoma. Antibiotics: Antibiotics may be used when infections\u2014such as an abscess (pocket of pus)\u2014occur. They treat Crohn's disease, peri-anal Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. They are also used to treat pouchitis, which is an inflammation of the ileal pouch (also known as a j-pouch, a surgically constructed internal pouch for those who have had their large intestine removed), and for prevention of recurrent Crohn's disease after surgery.11 Biologic therapies: Biologic therapies are commonly used in the treatment of pediatric IBD. Biologics are protein-based therapies made from living organisms, either human or animal. These medications are antibodies that stop certain proteins in the body from causing inflammation. These therapies are used to control moderate-to-severe disease and to maintain clinical remission. Biologics are typi-cally administered by injection or intravenous infusion on a schedule that varies from weekly to every few months, depending on the individual and the medication. There are also biologic medications known as biosimilars. Biosimilars are designed to be structurally similar and near identical copies of other already approved biologic therapies, also known as the originator drugs. Biosimilars have the same effectiveness and safety profile as the originator drug. Some biologic agents are particularly useful for one form of IBD, and others can be used in patients with either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK Inhibitors): These medications, currently available as tablets, are broken down in the gastrointes-tinal tract after ingestion and are directly ab-sorbed into the bloodstream via the intestinal wall. Due to the small size of these chemically active substances, they can be transported through the bloodstream to nearly any site in the body, including the immune system. Unlike some of the other tablet-based agents like thiopurines and methotrexate, these agents work more quickly and can induce and maintain remission. Tofacitinib is the first JAK inhibitor approved to treat ulcerative colitis. Off-Label: Sometimes doctors will prescribe medications that the Food and Drug Admin-istration (FDA) has not specifically approved for the treatment of Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, or may not be specifically approved in children. Nonetheless, these medications have been shown to be very effective in 12 reducing symptoms. Prescribing medications for other than FDA-approved conditions is known as \"off-label\" use. Your healthcare pro-vider may have to obtain prior approval from insurance companies before prescribing a medication for off-label use. Your health care team might need to make a special appeal in order for an insurance company to pay for an off-label medication. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications Prescription medications reduce intestinal inflammation and form the core of IBD treat - ment. As such, prescription medications may not eliminate all of your child's symptoms. You may want your child to take over-the-counter medications in an effort to make them feel better. Before doing so, please speak with your child's doctor, or other healthcare professional. Sometimes your child's symptoms can indicate a worsening of the inflammation that may require a change in prescription IBD medication, or other course of treatment. As with all medications, you should know the risks and benefits and discuss any concerns with your child's doctor. There are many therapies currently under investigation. For a current up-to-date list of all FDA-approved medications for IBD, please visit the Foundation's online IBD Medication guide: www.ibdmedicationguide.org. 13 Additional information is available in our Un- derstanding IBD Medications and Side Effects brochure. Medication changes and adherence Your child's Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis can be controlled with the right treatment. You should have an open dialogue with your child's healthcare provider and inform them if your child is still experiencing IBD symptoms while in treatment. During these discussions, you should feel comfortable asking the doctor about other available treatment options. Keep in mind that medications are most effective when they are taken as prescribed by your child's doctor. Adherence means that your child is following the medical advice of the physician with regard to: Taking prescribed medication, vitamins, and supplements in the proper doses and at the proper times Returning for scheduled medical appointments Even with the best intentions, it is easy to forget taking medication. To help your child remember: Check out the applications available on your mobile device that can help to track symptoms, diet, and fitness goals. Many of these apps have the option to add notes alongside entries, which can help track and manage your symptoms or triggers. You can also go off-line and track various aspects of your disease in a daily journal. Place medications in locations where your child will be during that time of the day. For example, a medication that has to be taken in the morning and at night might be best stored in plain sight in the same bathroom where the child brushes their teeth.14 Load a multi-dose pillbox with medications each week so missed doses can easily be seen. It is still possible to experience symptoms even with complete adherence. Your child's physician should be notified if this happens, so that they can consider whether or not this should trigger a change in therapy (agent, dose, or dosing interval). It is not unusual for a child to be prescribed different medications in response to an increase or decrease in symptoms, or in response to an evidence-based change in a standard of care. Nutritional support therapy Optimal nutrition is necessary to ensure optimal growth and development in all children. However, this may be difficult to achieve without intervention. In some cases, patients benefit from regular visits with a nutritionist to ensure that dietary goals are being met. In cases in which children with IBD are manifesting poor weight gain or linear growth (getting taller), the nutritionist may prescribe specific foods and liquid supplements that are higher in calories and protein. Intestinal inflammation in patients with IBD, and particularly those with Crohn's disease, may improve with nutritional support. This may require the delivery of a nutrient-rich liquid formula directly into the stomach or small bowel (known as enteral nutrition). This type of nu-tritional support is typically given overnight and delivered through a nasogastric (NG) tube. This method ensures that patients receive adequate nutrition over the course of the day with the least amount of effort and stress (both for the patient and the parents). In the morning, the NG tube is removed, and the patient can go to school and pursue their usual activities. If it is anticipated that enteral feedings will be required over a more prolonged period, and the 15 idea of placing an NG tube every night causes increasing inconvenience or discomfort, patients can undergo placement of a gastrostomy tube (G-tube). A gastrostomy is a surgically created opening through the abdominal wall, leading directly into the stomach. A feeding tube can be passed through this opening. Feedings can be delivered overnight through the gastrostomy. However, because there is no need to insert a tube, patients with IBD can also receive enteral nutrition intermittently throughout the day. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is delivered through a catheter placed into a large blood vessel, usually one in the chest. Although nutrition delivered in this manner bypasses the intestine and thereby allows the bowel to rest, parenteral nutrition often leads to more complications than enteral nutrition. It is also more expensive than the other methods of nu-tritional support, and requires more specialized training to use. To find more information on nutritional support therapy, download the Diet, Nutrition, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease brochure. 16 Surgery In the treatment of IBD, all medical efforts are aimed at sustaining the health of the intestines, especially in children. However, some patients may reach a point where surgery is the best option, or may be necessary. In Crohn's disease, surgery may involve removal of the diseased area of the bowel (called a resection), but the disease may reoccur at the site of the surgery or other area along the gastrointestinal tract. In ulcerative colitis, surgery may be recom- mended to remove all or part of the colon, which may also involve removal of the rectum. After surgery, some patients may experience extraintestinal complications (symptoms outside the colon). While in some situations patients and their loved ones are able to decide whether surgery is the right choice for them, there may also be urgent situations that require more immediate surgery. As with all procedures there may be risks involved, new diet recommendations, or other changes to daily activities that your child may need to adjust to. To learn more about the different types of surgeries, download the Surgery for Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis brochure. Complementary medicine Some people living with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis look toward complementary medicine, also known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to use together with conventional therapies to help ease their symptoms. Complementary therapies may work in a variety of ways. They may help control symptoms and ease pain, enhance feelings of well-being and quality of life, and possibly boost the immune system. If you are interested in ex -17 ploring a complementary therapy for your child, discuss it with your child's healthcare provider. To learn more about complementary medicine, check out the Complementary and Alternative Medicine fact sheet at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org. Other considerations With IBD, there may be some adjustments you need to help your child make, including altering diet or preparing them for daily activities. Diet and nutrition Paying attention to diet may help reduce symptoms, replace lost nutrients, and promote healing. Two things you should remain vigilant about are your child's weight and growth rates. Since weight loss is a symptom of a flare-up, any loss in weight should be reported to your child's physician. Similarly, growth may slow or cease during periods of disease activity. If your child's growth seems to slow considerably (they wear the same size clothing for more than a year, seems smaller than other children of the same age, etc.), bring this to the atten-tion of your child's doctor. Because IBD affects the digestive system, diet and nutrition are impacted in a variety of ways. There is no evidence to suggest that any particular food or diet causes, prevents, or cures IBD. There is no single diet or eating plan that will work for everyone with IBD. Attention must be paid to avoiding foods that worsen or trigger disease symptoms. It is also important to help children learn how to make healthy food choices, address nutritional deficiencies, and maintain a well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet. Every child needs good nutrition to help them grow and develop. While many children with IBD require relatively little or no change 18 in diet, there may be times when modifying the diet can be helpful, particularly when their disease is active. An altered diet may be recommended during different times by your child's physician. To learn more about diet and nutrition, review the Diet, Nutrition, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease brochure, videos, and more at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org. Vitamin and mineral supplementation Some children with IBD may become deficient in certain vitamins and minerals (including vitamins D, B12, and C; folic acid; iron; calcium; zinc; and magnesium), and they may need to supplement their diet to make up for the deficiencies. Vitamin D is essential for good bone formation and for processing calcium. It is recommended that children and adolescents with IBD be screened and monitored for vitamin deficiency. The recommended daily allowance for vitamin D depends on age, and ranges from 400-600 international units (IU) per day. Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the ileum. Children and adolescents with Crohn's disease that af - fects the ileum, and those who have had surgery to remove 20 inches or more of the ileum, may have vitamin B12 deficiency because they are unable to absorb enough of this vitamin from their diet. A blood test can measure the amount of vitamin B12 in the blood. A monthly injection or weekly nasal spray of vitamin B12 may be required for individuals who are deficient. Folic acid absorption may be affected by some drugs used to treat IBD, such as sulfasalazine and methotrexate. Patients who take these medications may require a folic acid supplement. Calcium supplements are recommended for patients taking corticosteroid medication, those 19 not getting enough calcium in their diet, and those who have reduced bone mineral density. Your child's healthcare provider can determine if a deficiency is present and if supplements are needed. Vaccinations Your child should continue to see a pediatrician to help monitor his or her physical development and make sure they are up to date with vaccina-tions, including annual flu vaccines. Make sure this physician is fully informed about your child's medications, as children on immunosuppressive or biologic therapies should not receive live virus vaccines. To learn more about healthcare maintenance for your child, download our healthcare maintenance discussion guide. Daily activities Now that your child has a disease that causes a greater reliance on the bathroom and other symptoms that may impact function, you should plan for more breaks in any scheduled activities. You may also want to encourage your child to review bathroom locations in malls, playgrounds, movie theaters, or other regularly visited areas outside of your home. Doing so can help your child feel more in control of their condition. Some states have created laws that allow access to \"employee only\" restrooms in businesses open to the public. Contact your local Crohn's & Colitis Foundation chapter to see if your state has passed the Restroom Access Act. If so, make sure your child has the required docu - mentation describing their need for immediate bathroom access any time he or she ventures out. During times of flare-ups, it may also help to pack a spare change of clothing and some moist wipes in a backpack for your child to carry.20 Find a Crohn's & Colitis Chapter and get more information about the Restroom Access Act at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/chapters. School accommodations Because children spend most of their waking hours in school, adults who tend to your child at school should be told about your child's illness for several reasons, including: IBD may lead to frequent absences or hospitalizations, make-up work, and other educational needs. Children with IBD may have a greater reliance on bathrooms and thus need open bathroom passes or access. Certain medications may need to be taken during the school day. Requesting a meeting with administrators and teachers to discuss the illness and your child's needs is a proactive way of dealing with potential future issues caused by IBD. Download and share a copy of the Guide for Teachers and Other School Personnel brochure with your child's school. While informing school administrators and teachers about your child's needs is necessary, your child may feel embarrassed about letting others know. Because it may be important to them, let your child decide with whom and when to share that information.

Two federal laws, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, provide protection for public school students with disabilities. Although both laws apply to students with disabilities, not all students with disabilities qualify for the protections of both laws. Each law has specific eligibility requirements and guidelines for services. 504 Accommodations Plan: Also known as the \"504 Plan,\" this law comes from Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This act requires recipients of federal education fund-ing to provide children with disabilities appro-priate educational services designed to meet the individual needs of such students, to the same extent as the needs of students with-out disabilities are met. A 504 plan spells out the modifications and accommodations that will be needed for these students to have an opportunity to perform at the same level as their peers, and might include such things as 22 an extra set of textbooks or home instruction. A Section 504 plan involves an evaluation of the child's disability, as well as his or her aca-demic abilities and specific provisions to help the child reach full academic potential. Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): First passed as the Education for all Handicapped Children Act in 1974, and most recently amended in 2004, the act governs how states and agencies provide certain edu-cational services to children with disabilities, including children with health impairments like IBD. For students with disabilities who require specialized instruction, IDEA controls the procedural requirements. The IDEA process is more involved than that required under Section 504. One of the provisions of the act requires schools that receive public funding to create an IEP for each child covered by the plan, ensuring that the unique needs of the child are met in the least restrictive environment. The \"individualized\" part of an IEP means that the plan has to be tailored specifically to your child's special needs. IDEA covers children with disabilities from birth to age 21. Informal (verbal arrangement with a teacher) and formal accommodations (items covered under a 504 plan or an IEP) for a child may help them reach and maintain their academic potential. Accommodations should be request - ed as soon as possible, preferably before the school year begins, so that there is time to make necessary arrangements and formalize plans. Remember, even if your child is perfectly healthy at the start of a school year, they may need accommodations during the year. It is always best to plan ahead! Some potential accommodations include, but are not limited to: Unlimited bathroom pass: Students with active disease symptoms may need to use the bathroom many times per day\u2014often urgently in order to avoid fecal incontinence. 23 The student and teacher should work out an appropriate bathroom signal to help avoid drawing attention to the student's frequent bathroom breaks. \"Stop the clock\" testing: When taking an exam, the student may need to take a break due to pain or bowel urgency. Test time will be extended by the amount of time that the student is away from the exam. Ability to hydrate: Frequent bowel movements and medication contribute to loss of fluids. Students should be allowed to carry and drink fluids throughout the day. Supply bag: Student will be permitted to eat small snacks and carry candy (to treat dry mouth), wet wipes, and other supplies throughout the day and use as needed. Tests and project limits: Medications and active disease symptoms may contribute to sleep deprivation and fatigue. As a result, the number of tests and projects can be limited to one to two per day. Test and project dead-lines can also be extended without penalty. Rest period: School nurse will provide a location as needed for students to lie down, or a private place to change clothes. School absence: After a specified number of days absent from school, the student will receive in-home or hospital tutoring. Alternate seating: To accommodate easy access to classroom exits, the student's seat may be changed. Medications: The student, parent, and nurse will meet to discuss and establish a medication schedule. Tutoring and support: If the student is absent for more than \"x\" days from school, he or she will have an opportunity to make up or get assistance with assignments. Students will be allowed to have an extra set of books at home.24 Extra-curricular programs: The student will be allowed to participate in programs and events without penalty due to absenteeism. Physical education class: The student should be allowed to self-monitor their energy level to determine if they can participate in physi-cal activities. The physical education teacher will notify the student's parents if there is ongoing non-participation in gym class. To learn more about school accommodations, please contact the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation's Irwin M. and Suzanne R. Rosenthal IBD Resource Center (IBD Help Center) by email at info@crohnscolitisfoundation.org, phone at (888) 694-8872, or online chat at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org. Physical activities Young people with IBD should be as active as possible. Outside of the physical benefits that include building stronger muscles and bones, these activities provide an outlet for stress and can help build confidence. Generally, there is no reason not to participate in sports, dance, or other physical activities, even if the disease is flaring up. Some modifications may be necessary if strenuous activities cause fatigue or aggravate abdominal pain, arthritis, or other symptoms. You and your child should also be vigilant about maintaining proper hydration. 25 Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy may make bones more susceptible to fracture during contact sports, such as football and wrestling. In these instances, a modified exercise program may be advisable. Emotional health and social support The diagnosis of a chronic illness can be difficult for anyone, but for children, it can be especially challenging to process and accept. Still developing both emotionally and physically, young people now must face an extra hurdle of chronic illness, which can pose a threat to a child's sense of well-being and security. As a result, children with IBD may become: Anxious Depressed Frustrated Stressed Agitated It is important to remember that these reactions are a response to their disease, and not its cause. 26 Children with IBD may be more prone to subtle emotional problems, which may not always be reflected in school performance, but may require them to exert more effort/energy to keep up with academic and social demands. As a result, they may get fatigued more quickly, feel less efficient, and become overwhelmed, leading them to withdraw from school and friends. These symptoms require careful monitoring from parents, teachers, and students to minimize the potential for undue distress. At times, a counselor or child psychologist may be helpful in enabling your child to regain the self-confidence that is sometimes impacted by chronic illness. If it takes much more work for your child to get good grades, keep up with friends, or enjoy things they used to, your child may benefit from educational and/or psychological interventions. Children can also find peer support and educa- tion through a number of avenues, including: Camp Oasis\u2014This Crohn's & Colitis Founda-tion-sponsored summer camp for children with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Learn more at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org. Support\u2014Support groups can be especially helpful. The best help, advice, and under - standing will come from interacting with people who know what you or your child is going through from personal experience. Find support groups in your area by contacting your local Foundation chapter. Justlikemeibd.org\u2014A website for teens. Campus Connection\u2014Your child can find tips for adjusting to their new environment in college and can connect to our online community through Facebook with other students who also are affected by IBD at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org.27 It might be helpful to teach your child techniques for coping with or relieving stress. By using these techniques, your child can stay calm, maintain perspective, and avoid anxiety. Encourage your child to try several different approaches and stick with ones that work for him or her. These can include: relaxation and breathing exercises practicing yoga or tai chi cognitive behavioral therapy meditation books, recordings, guided imagery, etc. Realize that the diagnosis may also have an emotional impact on others in the family. If there are other children in the family, they need to understand their sibling's condition and how it may impact their lives. It's important to reassure them that you still love them and want to be as involved in their lives as you've always been, although you may have to devote more time to the child who is ill. Your family may find comfort and support by participating in educational, social, and fund-raising activities sponsored by your Crohn's & Colitis Foundation chapter. Annual walks, Camp Oasis, educational seminars, and fund-raising events build a sense of community among those diagnosed with the disease and those who love them. 28 To find out what is happening in your chapter, go to www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org. Transitioning to independence and adult care Depending on your child's age and level of maturity, they may need more or less support with self-management of IBD. However, the earlier you help your child learn how to manage and take ownership of their IBD, the easier it will be for them to transition to independence as a young adult. In order to achieve independence, self- management plans can be used to teach your child to complete tasks on his or her own by taking an active role in planning, organizing, and monitoring their own behavior. Self- management strategies can be used to improve academic performance, productivity, and medication adherence, and to decrease negative feelings. The key components of self- management include setting goals, monitoring behavior, and evaluating progress. Building behavior, cognitive, organizational, problem-solving, follow-through, and other skills and self-management strategies requires that parents and healthcare providers work together to teach the child\u2014from understanding his or her condition and knowing medications, to making his or her own appointments and more general self-advocacy. Some important skills your child should start working toward building include: Describing their disease Naming their medication, doses, and side effects Taking medications independently Understanding risk of treatment non-adherence29 Knowing why medical tests are done Understanding the impact that drugs and alcohol can have on their body Voicing needs at school Asking questions and talking directly to doctors during appointments, without parents' help Knowing their medical team and how to reach them Knowing their health insurance information Every child is unique and learns these skills at their own pace. Encourage your child to practice these skills as early as possible, and to ask for help and support when needed. Children and teens can visit www.ibdskillsquiz. org to take a short quiz on managing IBD. Living your life It may be difficult and stressful for your child to accept that they have Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. As time goes on, this will not always be the case. In the meantime, try not to hide your child's condition from people close to you. Discuss it with them and help them understand what kind of support you need. 30 You'll learn that there are numerous strategies that can make living with IBD easier. Coping techniques for dealing with the disease may take many forms. For example, attacks of diarrhea or abdominal pain may make your child fearful of being in public places. But that isn't necessary. All it takes is some practical advanced planning. You may want to help your child incorporate some of the following steps into his or her plans: Find out where the restrooms are in restaurants, public parks, theaters, and on public transportation. Carry extra underclothing and toilet paper or moist wipes when traveling as needed. When venturing farther away or for longer periods of time, speak with your child's doctor first. Travel plans should include a long-term supply of medication, its generic name in case your child runs out or loses it, and the names of doctors in the area that will be visited. Encourage your child to go about daily life as normally as possible, pursuing activities as they did before diagnosis. There's no reason for your child to sit out on things that they have always enjoyed, or have dreamed of doing one day. Help your child learn coping strategies from friends and other supportive individuals. Your local Crohn's & Colitis Foundation chapter offers support groups, as well as informational meetings. This can allow you and your child to help others by sharing what you know, too. Develop a support network of family and friends to help you and your child manage the disease. Bring a family member or friend to your child's doctor's appointment for support.31 Join the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation's free online community www.crohnscolitiscommu - nity.org to get the support you need through participation in discussion boards, personal stories, chat rooms, and much more. Make sure your child follows the doctor's instructions about taking medication. Even when your child is feeling perfectly well, your child should continue to take their medication. Maintain a positive outlook. That's the basic\u2014and best\u2014prescription! While Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious chronic diseases, it's important to remember that most people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can lead rich and productive lives. There's no doubt that living with IBD is challenging\u2014your child will have to take medication and, occasionally, make other adjustments. Remember, too, that taking maintenance medication can help your child to maintain remission of disease activity and symptoms, allowing them to experience normal growth and development. Hope for the future Investigators all over the world are devoted to research to find the causes and cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. That's good news when it comes to the development of new therapies for these diseases. It is a very exciting time in the development of new therapies.
