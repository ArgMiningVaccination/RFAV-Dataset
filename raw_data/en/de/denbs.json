With this experience comes responsibility and integrating your experience properly is extremely important. With the proper integration, you will be able to tap into the true power of this medicine. If you are currently feeling confused, don't worry, take a deep belly breath, and rest assured that this will all make much more sense as you read further and time unfolds. After witnessing thousands of processes, we have come to a concrete conclusion when it comes to integration. The integration process of this medicine/therapy is extremely important, and it is an integral part of the overall therapy itself. It is VERY necessary to receive the full benefit of the experience and if integrated correctly, this experience is much more effective and beneficial. After this medicine/therapy, an individual can feel fragmented and confused due to experiencing the dissolving of the ego for the first time. That is exactly why it is so important to take time to properly integrate and digest the experience. Most of our belief systems, habits, fears, and understandings come from the experiences and conditioning we are exposed to during childhood. From the ages of 3-7 years old, we are quite literally soaking up any and all information around us, which in turn creates our perceived world. At this time, we are naturally in what's called the Theta brain wave state. During this time the individuality of someone is developed and the conditioning of our environment really sets in.Unfortunately, during this time, we typically aren't able to co-create or choose our environment whatsoever. During this time, We are simply at the mercy of the environment that is provided for us by our family, friends and geographic location. And most of the time, although many of our experiences could have been loving and nurturing, our environment usually isn't IDEAL for our overall well being. With this being said, we are very blessed to live in a world where we can ultimately CHOOSE what we believe in and stand for. We can also choose to alter the conditioning that was instilled in us at a young age and re-condition ourselves completely as conscious adults.We have the ability to take action and make the necessary choices to re-establish our belief systems, habits, and understandings.The entire premise of this therapy is to integrate the profound lessons and awareness that we receive from the therapy into our everyday lives. To treat others with love, compassion, generosity, and kindness. To be a better husband or wife, brother or sister. To put others before yourself. To treat yourself and others with love, respect, patience, and kindness. To hold yourself and your loved ones accountable. To openly communicate and express yourself in all ways. To help others in need. To be balanced, peaceful and fulfilled. To both experience, and aid in creating a better world for all to live in is the true purpose of this beautiful sacrament and the therapy it provides. While the experience of this therapy itself is awe-inspiring, it is the positive changes, beneficial habits, and newfound awareness that we integrate into our lives after the therapy that makes it so special, beautiful, and essential for evolution. For this reason, after the therapy, and during integration, It's very important that we avoid things that negatively affect our mindset, vibration, and frequency. Examples of this are, but not limited to: Conversely, it is important that we seek and pursue things that positively affect our mindset and frequency. Examples of this are, but are not limited to: You should give yourself, at the very minimum, 3 days to integrate. With that said, we strongly suggest taking 1 week - 1 month to properly integrate your experience for optimal results. Reactivations are very common and natural after Bufo Alvarius therapy, especially during sleep, meditation, and breathwork. It is when you reconnect to the non-dual state experienced during your ceremony. Although not everyone will experience re-activations, many people do about half of all those we serve. They typically last for roughly two weeks after therapy and if they go on longer than this, you should reach out to your facilitator or an integration specialist. THIS IS NORMAL. During reactivations, it is important to stay calm and breathe deeply. I highly suggest sinking into the experience and doing your best to explore and even enjoy it! Your dreams will most likely be much more intense and interesting than usual, this will pass as well. If you are experiencing a reactivation during meditation, breathwork or some other practice, and you get scared or want it to stop, simply stand up, move around, and start talking or singing. You can also splash water on your face or begin eating food. Basically doing anything to engage your 'thinking mind' should bring you out of the reactivation and you will be back to normal in no time. You can also try taking GABA, a natural calming supplement before bedtime to help with reactivations during the night that are interrupting your sleep. I also recommend including L-theanine, magnesium, and 5-htp (only take this supplement for a few weeks and wait a few weeks before taking again). But again, I highly encourage exploring and enjoying these experiences. They can teach you a lot and bring some clarity to the therapy itself, as well as your life and personal journey.
