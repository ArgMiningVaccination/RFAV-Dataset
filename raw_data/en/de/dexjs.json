Here, we focus onmalondialdehyde (MDA) epitopes as prominent examples of OSEs that trigger both innateand adaptive immune responses. First, we review the mechanisms of MDA generation, thedifferent types of adducts on various biomolecules and provide relevant examples forphysiological carriers of MDA such as apoptotic cells, microvesicles, or oxidized low-density lipoproteins. Based on recent insights, we argue that MDA epitopes contributeto the maintenance of homeostatic functions by acting as markers of elevated oxidativestress and tissue damage. We discuss multiple lines of evidence that MDA epitopes areproinflammatory and thus important targets of innate and adaptive immune responses.Finally, we illustrate the relevance of MDA epitopes in human pathologies by describing their capacity to drive inflammatory processes in atherosclerosis and highlighting protec- tive mechanisms of immunity that could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. 1. OVERVIEW Cellular stress, senescence, and cell death are tightly associated with oxidative stress. A major consequence of increased oxidative stress is the per-oxidation of membrane lipids resulting in the generation of various oxidation- specific epitopes (OSEs). OSEs and the immune responses targeting them have been implicated in many acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, mostprominently atherosclerosis. Studies of the biological activities of oxidizedLDL (OxLDL), which is a key pathogenic driver of atherosclerosis, have hel-ped identify OSE as a novel class of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In this chapter, we will particularly focus on a certain group of OSEs, namely malondialdehyde (MDA) epitopes. MDA epitopes have beendocumented on the surface of dying cells and in damaged tissues. Recentstudies have identified them as major targets of various immune responses that modulate homeostatic processes, eg, the clearance of apoptotic cells. In ath- erosclerosis, which is characterized by impaired resolution and chronicinflammation, MDA epitopes have been identified as mediators of inflamma-tion and therefore serve as interesting potential targets for immunological therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). 2. BIOCHEMISTRY AND GENERATION OF MDA IN VITRO AND IN VIVO Oxygen is a fundamental prerequisite for energy production by cellular respiration in aerobic organisms. However, this also results in the constant2 N. Papac-Milicevic et al.generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as potentially damaging by-products, which are produced endogenously in mitochondria, peroxi- somes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and even in the plasma membrane of cells,but can also be induced exogenously by UV light, heat, bacterial, and envi-ronmental agents, such as tobacco smoke and ionizing radiation ( Bae, Oh, Rhee, & Yoo, 2011; Nathan & Cunningham-Bussel, 2013 ). Newly generated ROS can attack membrane lipids containing carbon -carbon double bonds (eg, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of phospholipids), damage themby called lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation of free fatty acidsoccurs through both enzymatic nonenzymatic mechanisms. If not effi- ciently controlled this emanates in the perturbed integrity of different cellular structures potentially leading to cellular death ( Nathan & Cunningham- Bussel, 2013 ). Enzymatic from the double allylic-activated CH 2group of PUFAs, oxygen is added, generating a peroxydienyl radical. This is then transformed into an anion and the reaction is terminated byback-transfer of the proton generated in the first reaction step, resulting in the formation of a lipid-hydroperoxide molecule (LOOH). Nonenzymatic mechanisms are mediated by free radicals, which can be indirectly generatedby ). In turn, free radicals are able to remove hydrogen from aC H 2group of PUFAs, resulting in the generation of LOOH and new dienyl radicals, which propagate this chain reaction. LOOHs that are gener- ated by both reactions then decompose and during their degradation agreat variety of secondary products such as MDA, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and the remaining core aldehyde of oxidized phospholipids, such as 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, are produced ( Yin, Xu, & Porter, 2011 ). These end products of lipid peroxidation are highly reactive aldehydes, which can further propagate oxidative damageand are therefore considered to be downstream mediators of oxidative stress. Under normal conditions, lipid peroxidation is inhibited enzymatically by the activities dismutases and catalases,or nonenzymatically by vitamin C and vitamin E ( Niki, 2009). It has been extensively shown that an imbalance between oxidative stress and antioxidant mechanisms results in pathological oxidation Holbrook, 2000; Nathan & Cunningham-Bussel, 2013 ). There- fore, total levels of end products of lipid peroxidation, especially of freeand adducted MDA, are widely used as indicators of oxidative stress in higher3 Malondialdehyde Epitopes as Targets of Immunityeukaryotic organisms and have been shown to correlate with the extent of tissue damage in acute injury and chronic diseases ( Imai et al., 2008; Pamplona et al., 2005; Weismann et al., 2011; Yla-Herttuala et al., 1989 ). Here, we will mainly focus on the biology of one of these reactive ter- minal aldehyde with the chemical formula C3H4O2that at physiological pH mainly exists in its enol form ( Nair, O'Neil, & Wang, 2001 ). The chemical structure of MDA is given in Fig. 1 . Under physiological conditions, newly generated MDA can modify free amino acids, proteins, nucleotides, and phospholipids creating stable covalent epitopes. Major in vivo carriers of MDA epitopes identified so far are apoptotic/necrotic cells ( Amir et al., 2012; Chang et al., 1999, 2004; Chou et al., 2009; Weismann et al., 2011 ), microvesicles (MV) ( Huber et al., 2002; Liu, Scalia, Mehta, & Williams, 2012; Tsiantoulas et al., 2015 ), and oxidized lipoprotein particles Palinski et al., 1989; Tang, Heinecke, & Oram, 2010 ). The main substrates for the generation of MDA in vivo are arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6) present in membrane phospholipids. Already in the 1970s Pryor et al. ( Pryor & Stanley, 1975 ) pro- posed possible mechanisms of MDA generation from these two PUFAs. He suggested the formation of intermediates that are bicycloendoperoxides, which are then broken down by thermal- or acid-catalyzed reactions giving rise to free MDA. Additionally, it was observed that certain amounts of MDA can be generated as a side product of thromboxane A2 synthesis. The enzymes cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) or COX-2 metabolize AA to prostaglandin H 2 (PGH 2), and newly formed PGH 2is then metabolized by 1989 ). Several reports suggested that MDA can also formed by oxidation of spermine ( Q u a s he ta l . ,1 9 8 7 ), UV-irradiation of the skin surface lipid squalene ( Dennis & Shibamoto, 1989 ), or carbohydrates ( Cheeseman, Beavis, & Esterbauer, 1988 ). structure of malondialdehyde. MDA is an aldehyde with the chemical formula C 3H4O2. At physiological pH, it exists mainly in its enol form ( left structure ). MDA has a molar mass of 72.06 g/mol, a density of 0.991 g/mL, and its melting point and boiling point are at 72 \u00b0C and 108 \u00b0C, respectively. It is produced by acid hydrolysis of 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane at room temperature in vitro ( Nair et al., 2001 ), and due to its high reactivity usually not observed in a pure form.4 N. Papac-Milicevic et al.3. GENERATION OF MDA EPITOPES exists as a bifunctional electrophile and its reactivity is pH dependent. At physiological pH MDA is present in the enolate ion form. MDA reactivity can be increased by lowering the pH, which favors the for- mation of beta-hydroxyacrolein, thereby increasing its affinity toward nucle- ophilic molecules in the vicinity ( Esterbauer, Schaur, & Zollner, 1991 ). In addition, it has been demonstrated that at high concentrations of MDA in an acidic milieu (pH range 4 -7) long oligomers of MDA are formed, which results in hydrolytic cleavage Maya, This observation is very important, as AcA and MDA can react together and create a more complex form of immunogenic epitopes, malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde (MAA). Due to their chemical nature free AcA and MDA possess the ability to create epitopes on major cellular mac- romolecules in different tissues serving as mediators of oxidative stress (Fig. 2 ). Forming stable epitopes with biomolecules has been suggested to increase the half-life of MDA in vivo ( Siu & Draper, 1982 ). Furthermore, MDA modifications of lipids, nucleotides, free amino acids, and proteins may result in their loss of function, loss of structural integrity, and may lead to altered cellular responses ( Fogelman ). Modifications of each type of macromolecules will be discussed separately. Fig. 2 Mechanism of MDA epitope formation. Lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by enzymatic or nonenzymatic mechanisms results in the generation of highly reactive aldehydes such as MDA, acting as mediators of oxidative stress. Covalent attachment of MDA to amino groups present in, eg, Lys of biomolecules nearby results in the formation of MDA epitopes.5 Malondialdehyde Epitopes as Targets of Immunity3.1 MDA Modification of Amino Acids and Proteins MDA-modified biomolecules such as free amino acids or proteins have been identified in different tissues and body fluids in humans and animals in et al., 2005;Weismann et al., 2011 ). Indeed, at neutral pH in the presence of free lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg), MDA can hydrolyze and form epitopes on their side chains. Additionally, at lower pH MDA has also been shown to formepitopes on another group of amino acids, including glycine Nair et al., 2001 ). Proteins are typically modified by MDA on the -amino groups of their side chains forming various epi- topes by Schiff base reaction ( Slatter, Watson, Preedy, & Zibadi, 2012 ). These include preferentially side chains of Lys, but modifications of His, Tyr, Arg, ethionine (Met), glutamine (Gln), and Cys al., 1991; Gurbuz & Heinonen, 2015; Watson et al., 2012 ). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that both glycosylation and the acetylation of proteins render them more susceptible for MDA modification, possibly as a result of slight alterations in the tertiary structure of the protein that facilitate access for MDA( Mooradian, Lung, & Pinnas, 1996; Tuma, Thiele, Xu, Klassen, & Sorrell, 1996 ). In human and animal models of disease MDA epitopes have been detected on proteins found in serum and urine, as well as on proteins ofthe extracellular matrix, and many intracellular ones et 2008;Weismann et al., 2011; Yla-Herttuala et al., 1989 ). Based on available liter- ature we have generated an extensive list of endogenous proteins that had been reported to be modified by MDA, and these are presented in Table 2 . In four different species, MDA modifications of a total of 107 pro- teins have been reported, of which five were found in at least two different organisms. These five proteins are ATP synthase (subunit 1), albumin, and actin. Interestingly, the majority of the proteins have mitochondrial ori-gin, strengthening the notion that mitochondria, being major reservoirs of ROS, could be one site within the cell where MDA epitopes are preferen- tially generated.6 of epitopes between MDA and primary amines have been reported, including fluorescent and nonfluorescent ones as well as cross-linking or noncross-linking ones. Important examples are presented in Fig. 3 . The most common type of adduct is N--(2-propenal)lysine ( Fig. 3 A), which is a linear nonfluorescent adduct without the ability to generate cross- links and forms in the absence of AcA at pH 7 ( Uchida, Sakai, Itakura, Osawa, & Toyokuni, 1997 ). It identified as the major form of endogenous MDA excreted in rat and human urine using ion exchange and high-performance liquid chromatography ( Draper, den Bergh, & Draper, 1988 ) and has been detected on in vitro LDL al., 2010 ). More complex MAA epitopes on -amino groups of Lys are formed by MDA and AcA in a 2:1 ratio ( Tuma et al., 1996 ). The two major MAA a ex\u00bc395 nm and nm. It requires close proximity of two intermediates, including an FAAB adduct that is generated when one mol- ecule of MDA and one of AcA react with free amino groups of a protein side Fig. 3 Chemical structures of MDA epitopes found on Lys side chains of protein (Gonen et al., 2014; Uchida, 2000 ).R, protein backbone. (A) 4-Methyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarbaldehyde derivative. (D) Pyridium and an Schiff base (MDA-enamine) generated by the reaction of MDA with another free amino group. After the generation of these two inter- mediates, the FAAB moiety is transferred to the nitrogen of the MDA-enamine followed by ring closure yielding the MDHDC adduct ( Fig. 3 C) (Tuma et al., 2001 The formation of MDHDC epitopes has been demon- strated to be favored by acidic conditions (pH 4). Using NMR spectroscopy (Kearley, Patel, Chien, & Tuma, 1999 ) and performing chemical analysis (Xu et al., 1997 ) it has been shown that MAA epitopes are different from those epitopes formed when both aldehydes are allowed to react alone. Several linesof evidence suggest that this type of MAA epitopes possesses potent biological activity ( Tuma et et al., 1997 ), although N--(2-propenal) lysine epitopes also been shown to be highly immunogenic ( Gonen et al., 2014). Moreover, epitopes with the ability to form cross-links between dif- ferent Lys residues in vitro have been found as well. These epitopes form cross-links within the same domain of a protein or domains in close proximity. In these reactions, one lysine residue forms a Schiff base with MDA, which isstabilized by equilibration to an enolate, and reacts then with second Lysresidue to form a diimine cross-link ( Requena et cross-links, such as 1-amino-3-iminopropenes ( Fig. 3 B), and more complex ones that are also fluorescent, such as pyridium -dihydropyridine epitopes have been described Osawa, 1996 cross-linking using and EI-MS ( Slatter, Murray, & Bailey, 1998 ). Such epitopes have been proposed to play a role by affecting structural proteins, such as collagen in the vessel wall where this couldcontribute to vascular stiffening and development of vasculopathies. In addi-tion, vitro MDA cross-links distant Lys residues of ApoAI ( Shao et al., 2010) as well as purified ApoE3 and ApoE4 molecules ( Montine of proteins are formed on platelet proteins upon platelet activation and have been found to be increased in diseases associated with platelet activation, such as metabolic syndrome and sickle cell anemia( Z a g o l - I k a p i t ee ta l . ,2 0 1 5 ). 3.2 MDA Modification of Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids Free MDA has been shown to covalent with Papac-Milicevic et al.reaction that is enhanced in the acidic milieu. The major epitopes that can be formed by these reactions are pyrimido-[1,2- ]purin-10(3 H)- one ). Of these, M 1G are five times more abundant than M 1A adducts in the liver, and the amounts of M 1C are generally very low ( Chaudhary, Reddy, Blair, & Marnett, 1996 ). MDA is considered to be a potent mutagen (Esterbauer et al., 1991 ), and MDA modifications of nucleotide bases of DNA have been shown to induce geno toxicity by various mechanisms. MDA epitopes on nucleotides can cause Hashim, Shyr, Niedernhofer, Daniels, Rouzer, -protein cross-links (Voitkun & Zhitkovich, 1999 ). Interestingly, it has been shown that DNA isolated from human and rat liver exposed to enhanced lipid per- oxidation contains increased amounts of MDA epitopes on DNA( C h a u d h a r ye ta l . ,1 9 9 4 ). Nucleotide excision repair has been suggested to be the main mechanism of repair for M 1G-caused damage in DNA (Marnett, 1999 ). Moreover, mitochondrial DNA has been found to have a higher abundance of MDA-DNA epitopes compared to nuclear DNA.This increased amount of MDA epitopes in mitochondrial DNA isthought to be due to the lack of repair in mitochon- Interestingly, increased levels of MDA-adducted nucleotides are found in the serum and urine of patients suffering from cancer as well as diseases associatedwith increased ROS production ( Gungor et al., 2010; Munnia al., 2006; al., 2011 ). 3.3 MDA Modification of Phospholipids In contrast to MDA modifications of proteins or nucleotides, only little data are available on MDA modification of phospholipids, which can be modi- fied Indeed, aminophospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine MDA-modified PS and PE have in aging erythrocytes possibly as a consequence of peroxidative damage Farinas, in urine ( Draper et al., 2000; Uchida et al., 1997 ).9 Malondialdehyde Epitopes as Targets of Immunity3.4 Metabolism of MDA Epitopes In Vivo Not much is known about metabolism of MDA epitopes in vivo. Marnett et al. injected intraperitoneally14C-labeled MDA into male and female Swiss Webster mice and found rapid and uniform distribution of labeledMDA throughout the body ( Marnett, Buck, Tuttle, Basu, & Bull, 1985 ). Moreover, it was observed that conversion of MDA to CO 2is completed in 4 h. In another study, urine samples obtained from rats challenged with oxidative stress by treatment with iron nitrilotriacetate or carbon tetra-chloride or vitamin E deficiency were found to have MDA present inproteins, nucleic acid bases, and phospholipids as measured by HPLC( Draper et al., 2000 ). A similar excretion pattern, albeit in much smaller amounts, was observed in urine samples obtained from humans ( Draper et al., 2000 ). Additionally, it has been shown that MDA levels in human urine can be modulated by diet, physical exercise, and smoking 4. CARRIERS OF MDA EPITOPES Tissue stress and subsequent cellular damage result in the generation of dying cells, the release of MV, and the accumulation of cellular debris.A number of studies have documented the presence of MDA epitopes on apoptotic cells and MV. For example, we and others could show that MDA-specific antibodies bind to serum-deprived apoptotic endothelialcells, necrotic cells and apoptotic blebs from retinal pigment epithelial cells ( Amir et al., 2012; Aredo et al., 2015; Chang et al., 1999; Chou et al., 2009; Weismann et al., 2011 ) (see Table 1 for an overview). Furthermore, MDA epitopes have been found on the membranes of oxidized MV released fromendothelial cells ( Huber et al., 2002 ), and human monocytic cells treated with unesterified cholesterol ( Liu et al., 2012 ), as well as on in vitro gener- ated platelet-derived MV and on circulating MV collected from humanblood ( Gil et al., 2002; Tsiantoulas et al., 2015 ). In addition, MDA has been detected in aging erythrocytes, suggesting the presence of MDA epitopes in their membranes. MDA epitopes have been identified on plasma lipoproteins and proteins. Among the lipoproteins, oxidized high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and10 N. Papac-Milicevic et al.low-density lipoprotein (LDL) eluted from the been shown to carry MDA epitopes ( Haberland, Fong, & Cheng, Shao et al., 2010; Yla-Herttuala et al., 1989 ). In addition, other proteins modified by MDA have been detected in body fluids and tissues of different organisms listed in Table 2 .Table 1 Cellular and Subcellular Carriers of MDA Epitopes Carrier Type Induction Method of Detection References Microvesicles (MV) Circulating MV Flow cytometry Tsiantoulas et al.

TARGETS OF IMMUNE RESPONSE As described earlier, MDA modifications of endogenous molecules are typically associated with structural changes and subsequently functional alterations of these macromolecules. Moreover, MDA modifications occuras a consequence of increased oxidative stress and therefore signify tissuedamage. Thus, for the host to deal with potentially harmful effects of altered self-molecules it needs to recognize them and respond to their accumula- tion, eg, by mounting specific immune responses. Already in the 1980sWitztum and colleagues have shown that injection of guinea pigs with glu-cosylated autologous LDL or glucosylated autologous albumin resulted in the generation of antisera recognizing the glucosylation itself but not the proteins that were modified ( Witztum, Steinbrecher, Fisher, & Kesaniemi, 1983 ). In a follow-up study, specific antisera could also be generated with Curtiss, 1984 ). These pioneering studies demonstrated that even the smallest mod- ifications of autologous proteins can result in the haptenization of self-proteins leading to the formation of neo-self antigens that are recognized by the immune system. This concept has provided insights into the mech- anisms by which oxidation of LDL renders it immunogenic, as this processgenerates several different OSEs that modify OxLDL particles and are rec-ognized by the immune system in a hapten-specific manner. Many different OSEs have been characterized, including 4-HNE, phosphocholine (PC) of oxidized phospholipids, and MDA ( Hartvigsen et al., 2009 ). There is now ample evidence that OSEs are recognized by both innate and adaptiveimmunity. 6. INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSES TOWARD OSEs The innate immune system is instantaneously capable of recognizing a broad range of structures via pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). Depending on whether the ligands originate from a foreign source (eg,microbes) or from within the host, they have been collectively namedpathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), respectively. Tissue-resident macrophages expressing PRRs on their surfaces are among the first cells of the innate20 N. Papac-Milicevic et al.immune system to sense PAMPs or DAMPs and initiate an inflammatory response to ultimately remove pathogens or the triggering agent, respec- tively. Several classes of PAMPs, such as bacterial (LPS), bacterial flagellin, lipoteichoic acid from Gram-positive bacteria, double-stranded RNA, unmethylated CpG motifs and DAMPs, such as high mobility group box 1 protein, heat shock proteins, ATP, and uric acid have been described ( Chen & Nunez, 2010; Krysko et al., 2012 ). DAMPs are typically intracellular components that are secluded from the recognition by the immune system and can be released into extracellular environment upon cellular damage. Because DAMPs convey a message of danger to other cells employing specific cellular receptors and triggering innate immunity response, OSEs, including MDA, which fulfill these criteria can be consid- ered a novel class of DAMPs ( Fig. 4 )(Miller et al., 2011 ). Indeed, OSEs are recognized by PRRs present on macrophages, such as the heterogeneous family of scavenger receptors (SRs), which bind and internalize (scavenge) oxidized but not native LDL ( Canton, Neculai, & Grinstein, 2013 ). Among SRs, CD36 and SR-A1 are the two most relevant receptors for the uptake of OxLDL, which leads to the formation of lipid- laden foam cells\u2014a hallmark of atherosclerotic lesions. Importantly, some Fig. 4 Overview of MDA epitopes and their interaction with different arcs of innate immunity. MDA epitopes are DAMPs generated on biomolecules such as LDL in athero- sclerotic lesions due to oxidative stress and on the surface of cells, cellular debris, or microvesicles during apoptosis and cell activation. Both soluble- and membrane-bound factors of the innate immune system bind to MDA epitopes presented on OxLDL or cell membranes including natural antibodies such as E014 and NA17, the scavenger recep- tor SR-A1 and two members of the complement system, CFH and C3a. Also other OSEs are recognized by innate immunity (not shown here).21 Malondialdehyde Epitopes as Targets of ImmunityOSEs are not merely taken up by SRs but can also serve as inflammatory mediators alarming the immune system about the damage inflicted by ath- erogenic lipoproteins. Another important PRR involved in clearing dam-aged lipoproteins are toll-like receptors (TLRs), which bind to a vast varietyof different PAMPs and DAMPs, including OSEs. Certain recognition of by CD36 on macrophagesenables the formation of a heterotrimeric complex consisting of CD36,TLR4, and TLR6, which mediates inflammatory responses resulting in nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF- B) pathway activation and expression of chemokines including Stewart et al., 2010 ). Macrophages lacking any of the three receptors fail to respond to OxLDL stimulation, while TLR2 defi- ciency does not have any effect. TLR2, however, seems to play a role whenmacrophages subjected to endoplasmatic reticulum stress are stimulated withseveral oxidized phospholipids, saturated fatty acids, and OxLDL, a induction of apoptosis ( et a number of PRRs recognize OSEs and act as sensors of oxidative stress. Upon ligation of OSEs with their corresponding PRRs, signal trans-duction events are initiated that culminate in sterile inflammatory responses characterized by chemokine secretion, leukocyte recruitment, or tissue repair. There is accumulating evidence that certain PRRs and pattern rec-ognition proteins (PRPs) are also involved in sensing of MDA epitopes asDAMPs, and in the following section we will review published work both on the recognition by innate immunity and on the proinflammatory effects of MDA epitopes. 6.1 Cellular Receptors of MDA Epitopes In line with initial studies showing that modified but not native LDL is rec-ognized by macrophages via SRs ( Goldstein, Ho, Basu, & Brown, 1979; Henriksen, Mahoney, & Steinberg, 1981 ), Shechter et al. demonstrated that both acetyl-LDL and fucoidin, known SR-A1 ligand, al., 1981 ), indicating that MDA-LDL is recognized and degraded also via a SR-dependent mechanisms. Similarly, lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) is recognized by human monocyte -macrophages via SRs only22 Papac-Milicevic as MDA-LDL, CuOx-LDL, and Fless, Scanu, & Fogelman, 1992 ). In addition, binding of LDL isolated from rabbit atherosclerotic lesions to mouse peritoneal macrophageswas competed for by MDA-LDL or polyinosinic acid, suggesting SR-A1-mediated uptake ( Yla-Herttuala et al., 1989 ). In light of this, MDA epitopes present on altered self-molecules or on the surface of dying cells could be sensed and identified by SRs as waste markers and signals ofdisturbed homeostasis that are required to be scavenged, ie, removed fromthe system. More recently, additional groups have confirmed that SR-A1 is involved in binding to MDA-modified proteins in a number of different cell types,including J774 ( Willis, Klassen, Brouse, & ), bovine or human & Post, 2007 ), corroborating prior data that SR-A1 is one but not necessarily the only receptor binding to MDA epitopes. Indeed, Zhu et al. accidentally found that CD16, an Fc receptor (Fc R) included in the study as a negative control, inhibited the binding of J774 cells toMDA-LDL-coated wells to a larger extent than soluble CD36, which wasthe original target of interest ( Zhu et al., 2014 ). Similar to SRs, Fc Rs have been shown to identify and eliminate microbial pathogens. Binding to the Fc portion of antibodies attached directly to pathogens or to the surface ofinfected cells allows enhanced uptake and clearance by cells equipped withan Fc R. Four groups of RIIB are activating receptors containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activa-tion motif in their intracytoplasmic domain. In the study, the inhibition ofMDA-LDL binding occurred in a dose-dependent manner and was competed for by immune complexes, known ligands of CD16. Of note, CD16 did not bind to OxLDL. The authors also observed decreased MDA-LDL andimmune complex binding to macrophages after silencing or knocking outCD16, while OxLDL binding was unchanged between wild-type andCD16 /C0//C0macrophages. Lack of CD16 resulted also in reduced of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- ), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 which was dependenton Syk authors showed that CD16 might be23 Malondialdehyde Epitopes as Targets of Immunityan additional receptor for MDA epitopes next to SR-A1, possibly implying that a redundancy of uptake and clearance mechanisms could be beneficial for an organism to protect from consequences of oxidative stress. 6.2 Proinflammatory Effects of MDA Epitopes Inflammation is a physiological process caused by the body's own immunemechanisms that have evolved to sense and handle the undesirable presenceof both altered endogenous and exogenous stimuli. Resolution of an inflam-matory response can only occur when the inflammatory stimuli are cleared and no longer cause any harm. Impaired resolution and/or continuous gen- eration of inflammatory agents might result in the establishment of a chronicinflammation accompanied by persistent tissue damage. Various studies haveaddressed the proinflammatory capacity of MDA-modified proteins in dif- ferent cell types including primary cells and cell lines from different animal models. Stimulation of cells derived from rat heart or liver such as endothe-lial ( Duryee et al., 2008; Hill et al., 2004 Shubert, Sorrell, & protein major that the proinflammatory effects induced by MDA epitopes involve not only the activation of PKC ( Kharbanda et al., 2002; Wyatt & Shanmugam, 2012; Shanmugam et al., 2008 ) have been implicated. Interestingly, in analogy to cholesterol crystals, MDA epitopes were shown to induce lysosomal rupture upon uptake ( Willis et al., 2004 ) when stimulating J774 macrophages with MDA-modified hen egg lysozyme (MDA-HEL). The authors found that binding of MDA-HELto the cells occurs in a SR-A1-dependent manner and results in lysosomal rupture followed by cell death. Other studies have shown that treatment of a human hepatic stellate cell line with MDA-modified horse-serum albumininduces activation of ERK1/2 and NF- B( Kwon al., 2014 ). The same24 N. Papac-Milicevic et al.authors also demonstrated that Kupffer stimulated with MAA- modified human serum albumin secrete IL-6 after 2 h in the presence of LPS, building on an earlier observation that MAA-BSA-stimulated Kupffercells exhibited a synergistically enhanced cytokine response in the presenceof LPS ( Duryee et al., 2004 ). In contrast, synergistic of the TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4 with MDA-BSA in macrophages could be observed (Saeed et al., 2014 ). Additional validation of the proinflammatory capacity of MDA epitopes in vitro is provided in an unbiased approach, where Shanmugam et al. (2008) analyzed conditioned media of THP-1 cells treated with MDA-modified Lys using hybridization-based cytokine arrays. MDA-Lys was found to the levels 20 cytokines, including CCL11, CCL18, CCL28,tumor necrosis MCP-1 andMCP-2. Further in silico analysis of the networks involved using a pathway analysis software revealed that treatment with MDA-Lys induces targets involved in biological processes such as immune response, cellular move-ment, and cell-to-cell signaling. Using reporter gene assays or chemicalinhibitors, the authors showed that MDA-Lys induced activation of NF- B and p38 MAPK pathways. Furthermore, they observed that incubation of monocytes with MDA-Lys increases their adhesion to smooth muscle orendothelial cells. Together, they demonstrated that MDA-Lys impactsinflammatory gene expression, activation, and motility of monocytes. Thiswas also observed in a separate study using Jurkat T cells stimulated with free MDA ( Raghavan et al., 2012 ). Next to the expression of cytokines and adhesion molecules, several groups have also investigated motility, morphological changes, and effectson cell viability caused by MDA epitopes. For example, MDA-BSA-coated plates incubated with SR-A1-expressing HEK cells results a spread mor- phology within 10 min, accompanied by an increase in cell surface areaand the formation of membrane extensions after 2 h in a PI3-kinase- andSrc-kinase-dependent manner ( Nikolic et al., 2007 ). Morphological changes were also observed in rat heart endothelial cells stimulated with MAA-BSA ( Hill et al., 1998 ) or in J774 macrophages ( Willis et al., 2004 ) and in some cases these morphological alterations are followed by detach-ment and cell death ( Thiele et al., 2004; Willis al., 2004; Tuma, & Thiele, 2002 ). In contrast, MDA-LDL only weakly induced the expression of collagen I, collagen III, and fibronectin in human hepatic stellate cells ( Schneiderhan et al., 2001 ), while the cell morphology was found to be unchanged. Also THP-1 cells stimulated with MDA-LDL25 Malondialdehyde Epitopes as Targets of Immunitydisplayed even increased cell proliferation in one study ( Suzuki, Sasaki, Kumagai, Sakaguchi, & Nagata, 2010 ), and other researchers found that free MDA induces migration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells andBMDMs after 1 h of incubation ( Geiger-Maor et al., 2012 ), while rat neu- damaged by free MDA via induction of Ca2+influx ( Cai et al., 2009 ) or via a MAPK pathway in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Cheng, Wang, Yu, Wu, & Chen, 2011 ). These apparently inconsistent results may be due to the different cell types used in these studies. Never-theless, there is little doubt about the proinflammatory properties ofMDA epitopes in vitro. However, there are only few studies investigating the in vivo effect of MDA epitopes. One study by us showed that MAA- BSA induces a proinflammatory response in the retinal pigment epitheliumof mice upon intravitreal injection characterized by a robust increase in KCexpression ( Weismann et al., 2011 ). In another murine of lung injury, MAA-BSA or MAA-modified surfactant D (SPD) was instilled into the lungs of wild-type mice upon which elevated levels of neutrophils andKC were detected in the lung lavage fluid ( Wyatt et al., 2012 ). Even though the amount of in vivo data is scarce, it clearly corroborates the in vitro data demonstrating that MDA epitopes are DAMPs capable of alerting the immune system of high oxidative stress, inflammation, and potential tissuedamage by inducing secretion of cytokines. 6.3 Innate Recognition by IgM Natural Antibodies and Complement Natural antibodies (NAbs) are predominantly of the IgM class and constitute an important component of humoral innate immunity. In addition to their key role in the first line defense against microbial infections, NAbs also play avital role in the removal of apoptotic cells and metabolic waste to maintaintissue homeostasis ( Manson, Mauri, & Ehrenstein, 2005 ). They are naturally occurring antibodies that can bind microbial structures and stress-induced self-antigens through an evolutionary conserved repertoire of variableregions made out of nonmutated germline genes. In mice, IgM NAbs aresecreted by B-1 cells, which constitute a subset of primordial B cells with different surface marker expression, activation requirements, and a distinct anatomical location ( Baumgarth, 2011 ). NAbs are present at birth and detectable already at the fetal stage. They can be found in germ-free mice,indicating that their occurrence is independent of external antigenic stimuli. Nevertheless, their titers can be enhanced by positive antigenic stimulation ( Baumgarth, 2011; Baumgarth, Tung, & Herzenberg, 2005 ).26 N. Papac-Milicevic et al.First insights into the concept that IgM NAbs bind OSEs came from studies in which spleens of 9 months old Apolipoprotein E (Apoe)/C0//C0mice fed a high fat high cholesterol diet for 7 months, which exhibit high titersof OSE-specific IgM, were used to generate hybridoma cell lines ( Palinski et al., 1996 ). About 30% of the hybridoma cell lines producing IgM anti- bodies were recognizing epitopes of OxLDL. Interestingly, a large part of the clones identified were found to have specificity for MDA-LDL. Detailed characterization of one of the clones termed E06 that specificallybinds to PC of oxidized phospholipids of OxLDL demonstrated its CDR3region to be encoded by the canonical rearrangement of the identical V-D-J germ line genes that encode a previously characterized IgA NAb, called T15 ( Shaw et al., 2000 ). This suggested that many more OSE- specific IgM could be NAbs. Indeed, we could subsequently show thatplasma of mice that were kept under complete germ-free conditions contained IgM antibodies with specificity for several OSEs, including MDA-type epitopes ( Chou et al., 2009 ), demonstrating their natural occurrence in the absence of exposure to foreign antigens. Notably, colo-nization of the gut of these mice with microbiota of conventionally housed mice resulted in the expansion of some, but not all, OSE-specific IgM. The latter is consistent with the fact that many IgM NAbs possess dual reactivityfor microbial & Winslow, 2009 ). Moreover, we could also demonstrate that IgM antibodies in human umbilical cord blood of newborns contained high titers of IgM with specificity for OxLDL and MDA-LDL. In contrast to IgG, IgM are not transported across the placenta. Therefore, IgM in umbilical cordblood are exclusively of fetal origin and therefore can be regarded as humanNAbs. Interestingly, compared to the matched maternal plasma of the newborns, the IgM titers to OxLDL and MDA-LDL were significantly enriched in the umbilical cord plasma. Key evidence for the existenceof OSE specific and in particular MDA-specific IgM NAbs came fromcharacterization of the binding specificity of IgM derived from murine B-1 cells, isolated from the peritoneal cavities of wild-type mice. Both supernatants of purified B-1 cells stimulated with LPS or IL-5 as well asplasma of recombination-activating gene 1-deficient mice (Rag1 /C0//C0) (that do not have any functional B or T cells) reconstituted with purified B-1cells contained IgM with specificity for MDA epitopes. Importantly, ELISpot studies for the frequencies of IgM-secreting cells in the spleens and antigen absorption studies of the plasma IgM of B-1 cell reconstitutedmice revealed that ca. 15% of all B-1 cell-derived IgM Targets of as well as more complex MAA epitopes, which constitute the majority of OSE-specific IgM NAbs that represent 30% of the NAb repertoire. Finally, sequence analyses of the variableregion of a newly cloned anti-MDA IgM mAb, termed NA17, derivedfrom the spleens of these mice, did not reveal nucleotide variation togermline genes in the V Hrearrangements, and only 1 nucleotide insertion between V Land J Lgermline gene segments ( Chou et al., 2009 ). Similarly, previously cloned anti-MDA IgM NAbs (E014, LR04) Lichtman, Binder, Tsimikas, & Witztum, ). Thus, several lines of evidence identify MDA epitopes as major targets of IgM NAbs. The high prevalence of MDA-specific IgM NAbs is consistent with an important role in homeostatic housekeeping functions. Indeed, as describedearlier, apoptotic cells as well as MV carry MDA epitopes and are recognized by MDA-specific IgM. NAbs have been shown to play a critical role in the clearance of apoptotic cells via complement-dependent mechanisms ( Chen, Park, Patel, & Silverman, 2009; Ogden, Kowalewski, Peng, Montenegro, &Elkon, 2005 ). We could also demonstrate that the MDA-specific IgM NAb NA17 binds apoptotic thymocytes but not viable cells. Moreover, when injected together with apoptotic thymocytes into the peritoneal cavity ofmice, NA17 enhances their uptake by peritoneal macrophages in vivo( Chou et al., 2009 ). It has been suggested that MDA epitopes exposed on apoptotic cells guide the immunosilent and antiinflammatory clearance of apoptotic cells by recruitment of MDA-specific IgMs and corecruitment of C1q ( Chen et al., 2009 ). Thus, IgM NAbs with specificity for MDA have the capacity to engage certain functions of the complement system for hosthomeostasis. The complement system represents another humoral component of innate immunity. It is a complex system consisting of about 40 different pro-teins organized in three major pathways: the classical, the lectin, and thealternative pathway ( Ricklin, Hajishengallis, Yang, & Lambris, 2010 ). Major functions of complement involve the protection of the host from invading pathogens, the orchestration of innate and adaptive immune responses, andhousekeeping functions in promoting clearance of apoptotic cells. Immunecomplexes deposited on pathogenic surfaces initiate the classical pathway, arange of different carbohydrates exposed on pathogens initiate the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway has a low grade of constitutive activa- tion. Although each complement pathway has a unique way of initiation,they all converge at the step of C3 cleavage, a central component of the28 N. Papac-Milicevic et al.complement, by C3 convertases into a smaller C3a and a larger C3b frag- ment. Downstream of C3, all pathways are merged into one resulting in the generation of the terminal complement complex (TCC). Clearly, theproteolytic cascade of complement needs to be tightly controlled at severallevels to prevent deleterious consequences for the host, which is achieved bya group of proteins called regulators of complement activity (RCA). RCA family members are divided into two major subgroups, soluble ones, such as complement factor H (CFH) and C4-binding now increasing evidence that MDA epitopes also directly trigger specific aspects of complement. Using an unbiased approach to identifyMDA-reactive plasma proteins in pull-down assays using MDA-modifiedpolystyrene beads and plasma from Rag /C0//C0Ldlr/C0//C0mice, we identified CFH as a major binding protein for MDA epitopes ( Weismann et al., 2011 ). CFH is a glycoprotein in plasma with a concentration of 500 g/mL and acts as major regulator of the alternative complement pathway. CFHplays an important complement inhibitory role both in solution and attached to host cell surfaces. CFH regulates complement in three different ways: it disables the formation of the C3 convertase, facilitates binds to MDA epitopes directly andindependently of their protein carrier, but not to PC or 4-HNE epitopes ( Weismann et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, this binding seems to require the presence of advanced MAA epitopes such as MDHDC and is Ca2+- and Mg2+-independent. When CFH is bound to MAA-modified BSA, its complement regulatory activity in factor-I-mediated C3 cleavage is retained, as demonstrated by the fact that MAA-bound CFH had the capac- ity to cleave C3b into iC3b in the presence of factor I. This is important asopsonization of apoptotic cells with iC3b has been shown to mediate theirantiinflammatory clearance by macrophages, and we have demonstrated that binding of CFH to dying cells and blebs is in part mediated by MDA epitopes. CFH is a multidomain molecule composed of 20 domains namedshort consensus repeats (SCRs) arranged in a \"beads on the string\" fashion.Using recombinant constructs of CFH, in which different numbers ofSCRs had been deleted, we could demonstrate that only SCR7 and SCR19/20 were able to mediate binding of CFH to MAA epitopes. Nota- bly, SCR7 and described as clustering sites for mutationsin CFH that are associated with many complement-related diseases, such as29 Malondialdehyde Epitopes In this regard, we could demonstrate that CFH of carriers of the commonCFH SNP rs1061170 that results in an H to Y exchange on position402 (H402Y variant) exhibits severely impaired binding to MAA in agene-dosage-dependent manner with >60% decreased binding for homo- zygous carriers compared to homozygous controls. These findings provided important insights into the strong association of rs1061170 with the risk todevelop AMD\u2014a chronic inflammatory disease of the retina that is associ-ated with increased oxidative stress and the most common cause of blindness in the elderly. One may speculate that binding of MAA on apoptotic and necrotic cells by CFH may allow it to inhibit proinflammatory effects ofMAA and regulate complement activation on these surfaces. Indeed, wecould show that CFH at physiological concentrations has the capacity to inhibit MAA-induced IL-8 secretion by the human monocytic THP-1 cell line. Moreover, the induction of KC expression in the retinal pigment epi-thelium of mice injected intravitreally with MAA-BSA was completelyabolished when CFH was shown to scav- enge proinflammatory properties of MAA in vitro and in vivo, and to medi- ate important cofactor activity on MAA-carrying surfaces. Both propertieswould favor an antiinflammatory removal of potentially harmful dying cells.Recently, Aredo et al. generated transgenic CFH mice carrying humanCFH sequence for SCR6 -8 (with either 402Y or 402H), flanked by the mouse sequence for SCR1 -5 and SCR9 -20 ( Aredo et al., 2015 ). Aged mice transgenic for the human CFH H402 variant, in contrast to wild-typemice, had increased accumulation of MDA-modified proteins, increasedmicroglial/macrophage activation, and induction of proinflammatory gene expression in the retina. Similar results were observed when 11 months old mice of both groups where subjected to another model of chronicoxidative stress using hydroquinone diet and exposure to white fluorescentlight for 8 weeks ( Aredo et al., 2015 ). These findings support the notion that CFH binding to MDA may play an important role in AMD pathogenesis by modulating the consequences of oxidative stress and inflammation in theretinal pigment epithelium. Further insights into the potential importance of CFH binding to MDA were provided by studies investigating the effect of SNPs in SCR19 -20 of CFH that predispose to the development of aHUS ( Hyvarinen et al., 2014 ). This disease is characterized by the development of microangio- pathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia leading to renal failure30 N. Papac-Milicevic et al.(Nester et al., 2015 ). In this study, recombinant CFH SCR19 -20 constructs harboring various SNPs were tested for their ability to bind MDA-BSA. Eight out of 12 SNPs were found to alter binding to MDA-BSA. Theauthors suggested that impaired MDA binding observed in these CFHvariants may be involved in pathogenesis of aHUS. In addition, CFHSCR19 -20 fragments were found to bind to MDHDC epitopes as it has been shown for full-length SCR7-containing fragments ( Hyvarinen et al., 2014; Weismann et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, the authors suggested that binding of SCR6 -8 to MDA-BSA has a different nature of interaction, in contrast to the binding of SCR19 -20, as the SCR6 -8 could not be inhibited with increasing concentrations of NaCl ( Hyvarinen et al., 2014 ). Although CFH is a single chain molecule with SCRs organized in a \"beads on the string\" fashion, structural analyses suggest that when CFH isbound to, eg, C3b on cellular surface it is bent, and SCR4 and SCR9 are brought together in close proximity ( Kajander et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2009 ). It is not known how the 3D structure of CFH looks when it is bound to MDA, but it can be speculated that both domains (SCR7 and SCR19/20)cooperate in mediating binding to MDA, although both SCRs may bind to MDA epitopes in a different manner. The binding affinity of CFH to MAA- BSA, which actually represents the avidity whole molecule, was foundto be/C2462 nM ( Weismann et al., 2011 ). In addition to SCR-containing complement proteins, it has also been shown that recombinant human C3a, a proinflammatory anaphylatoxin, binds specifically to MDA- and MAA-modified LDL or BSA ( Veneskoski et al., 2011). The same authors also showed that MAA- and MDA-modified LDL comigrated with C3a in and facilitated scavenging ofC3a by J744A1 macrophages. Using ELISA, they demonstrated that C3a was binding to MDA- and MAA-modified proteins (HDL and LDL) but not to PC-modified proteins, suggesting that MAA/MDA epitopes onOxLDL mediate binding to C3a. Additionally, we also tested the bindingof plasma purified C3 to MAA-BSA by ELISA, but could not observe any binding. These data suggest that only upon cleavage of C3, the C3a fragment can bind to MDA ( Weismann et al., 2011 ). Thus, certain complement regulators and complement effectors bind to MDA and MAA epitopes in particular, which are present on OxLDL, apo-ptotic cells, and MV ( Veneskoski et al., 2011; Weismann et al., 2011 ). While CFH has been shown to limit MAA-induced inflammation, future studies need to explore the effects of MAA-decorated surfaces on complement acti-vation in general. Because MDA/MAA epitopes are major targets of IgM31 Malondialdehyde Epitopes as Targets of ImmunityNAbs as well as CFH, they may represent important hubs on dying cells and oxidized lipoproteins allowing complement to mediate critical house- keeping functions to maintain host homeostasis. The fact that MDA/MAAepitopes are recognized by membrane PRR, such as SR-A1, as well as sol-uble PRPs, such as CFH and IgM NAbs, identifies them as potent regulatorsof tissue homeostasis and as novel DAMPs of innate immunity ( Fig. 4 ). 7. ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY RESPONSES ON MDA EPITOPES In contrast to innate immunity, adaptive immunity is acquired throughout life following exposure to specific antigens. This results in thegeneration of a nearly unlimited repertoire of receptors with high antigen specificity and the generation of immune memory, which is carried out by various subsets of CD4+ Th and CD8+ Tc as well as B cells and theantibodies they secrete ( Lichtman et al., 2013 ). Different subsets of Th17 cells, have been described. A multitude of studies exists demonstrating that active immunization with MDA-modified proteins or lipoproteins triggers adaptive immune responses. These characterizations were mainly done in atherosclerosis- prone rabbits and mice. Moreover, adaptive IgG antibodies with specificityfor MDA have been documented in humans and several animal models ofatherosclerosis as well as models of ethanol-induced chronic inflammatorytissue injury ( Tuma et al., 1996; Xu et al., 1997 ). Based on this, Witztum and colleagues initiated studies to demonstrate the possibility to induce hapten-specific immune response against MDA epitopes. Both antisera(MAL-2) and monoclonal IgG antibodies (MDA2) generated inguinea and mice immunized with MDA-modified homologous LDL ( Palinski et al., 1989, 1990 ). These data suggested that the robust production of hapten-specific IgG antibodies occurs in a T cell-dependent manner. Wecould show that immunization of mice with homologous MDA-LDLinduced the robust production of T cell-dependent IgG antibody titers with specificity for MDA epitopes. Moreover, this immunization in which MDA-LDL was emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant for the primaryand incomplete Freund's adjuvant for the boosting injections resulted in apreferential production of Th2-dependent IgG1, whereas Th1-dependent IgG2a/c antibodies were only moderately induced. Antigen stimulation assays of splenocytes of immunized mice led to primarily32 N. Papac-Milicevic et al.IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and to a much lower degree IFN following stimulation with MDA-LDL, but not native LDL, consistent with a Th2-biased immune response ( Binder et al., 2004; Gonen et al., 2014 ). The studies also demonstrated the induction of T cells specific for MDA epitopes, whichlikely are recognized by T cells in the context of a specific peptide sequence.Indeed, Wuttge et al. showed that subcutaneous immunization of nude mice that lack T cells with MDA-modified autologous albumin fail to mount Bruzelius, & Stemme, 1999 ). We have confirmed the requirement of T cells for IgG responses triggered byMDA-LDL, as immunization of MHC class II /C0//C0or T-cell receptor /C0//C0mice with MDA-LDL failed to induce robust IgG antibody titers (Binder et al., 2004 ). In addition, immunization of CD4/C0//C0Apoe/C0//C0mice with MDA-LDL results in reduced IgG1, IgG2a/c, & Hansson, 2005 Notably, the remarkable Th2 dominated immune response to MDA- LDL induced by immunization occurs independently of the carrier, andcan be observed also when other proteins, eg, mouse serum albumin, mod-ified with other adducts, used as antigens ( Gonen et al., 2014 ). Nevertheless, MAA-modified proteins have been found to induce the strongest antibody responses. The strong immunoge-nicity of MAA epitopes in particular has been demonstrated before in severalimmunization studies of various organisms (bovine, human, rabbit, andmice), as immunization with MAA-modified homologous albumin induced specific antibodies even in the absence of any adjuvant ( Thiele et al., 1998 ). Of considerable interest is the fact that immunization of SR-A1/C0//C0mice with MAA-BSA resulted in a reduced generation of anti-MAA-BSA anti-bodies compared to control wild type, suggesting that SR-A1-mediated uptake of MDA-modified proteins by antigen-presenting cells is critical ( Duryee et both endogenous and exogenous MDA/ MAA haptens have the capacity to induce robust adaptive immuneresponses, which are characterized by antibody production and induction of specific Th cells. 8. MDA EPITOPES IN DISEASES There is a growing list of diseases in which increased levels of MDA have been detected using various methods ( Bhuyan, Bhuyan, & Podos, al., Aznar, Santos, & Fernandez, 1982; Wade, Jackson, Highton, & van Rij, 1987; Weismann et al., 2011; Yla-Herttuala et al., 1989 ). MDA has been documented in both chronic and acute diseases associated with high levels of oxidative stress, such as cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, meta- bolic, and communicable diseases ( Fig. 5 ). However, the levels of MDA determined in the plasma of healthy individuals have shown great variabi- lity, in part due to the method of blood drawing and sample preparation (Del Rio, Stewart, & Pellegrini, 2005 ). Moreover, the detection methods for MDA still possess a number of limitations. For example, the most com- monly used method for MDA detection, the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay, has long been known to be nonspecific ( Esterbauer et al., 1991 ). Although more reliable methods for detecting MDA levels with high specificity exist including MDA-specific antibodies or assays based on mass spectrometry ( Zagol-Ikapite et al., 2015 ), it still remains unclear if the detected changes of MDA are reliable biomarkers for all these diseases. Fig. 5 MDA epitopes in diseases. MDA epitopes can be found in many pathological settings affecting multiple organs including neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases, cancers, and also infectious diseases.34 N. Papac-Milicevic et al.9. RELEVANCE OF OSEs IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CVDs are among the most-studied diseases with respect to a role for MDA epitopes. CVDs constitute the major cause of mortality and disability worldwide ( Mendis et al., 2011 ). Generally, CVDs can be divided into two major subgroups, CVDs that arise due to atherosclerosis (stroke, heart attack,hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease) or CVDs that are independent of atherosclerotic process (congenital and rheumatic heart diseases, cardio- myopathies, and arrhythmias). According to the WHO, CVDs with athero-genic origin are responsible for 80% of CVD deaths. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of large- and medium- sized arteries and the underlying cause for heart attacks and strokes. Several nonmodifiable and modifiable risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia,hypertension, diabetes, smoking, gender, and age have been identified.Atherosclerotic lesion formation is sustained by high levels of plasma LDL cholesterol that are deposited in the artery wall, where an inflammatory reaction is triggered. These initial fatty streak lesions can progress to morecomplex plaques with many inflammatory infiltrates and large acellularnecrotic areas. Once these advanced plaques become unstable they are proneto rupture, which triggers a local thrombotic event that can ultimately lead to a heart attack or stroke. LDL belongs to a group of lipoprotein particles ranging in size from 18 to 25 nm with the major purpose to transport cholesterol in the circulation. Itcontains a single ApoB100 molecule (with 4536 amino acids, of which 356 are Lys) and a lipid part consisting of phospholipid and cholesterol mole- cules. Atherogenesis is initiated by endothelial cell dysfunction and intimalretention of LDL. Once LDL is trapped in the subendothelial space of thearteries it undergoes several types of modifications, most prominently enzy- matic and nonenzymatic oxidation leading to the generation of OxLDL. OxLDL itself triggers proinflammatory responses in endothelial cells andenhanced recruitment of monocytes into the intima of the artery wall( Gerrity, 1981; Quinn, Parthasarathy, Fong, & Steinberg, 1987 ). Recruited monocytes then differentiate into macrophages that further propagate the oxidation of LDL through 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) andmyeloperoxidase (MPO) pathway, thus enhancing the proatherogenicinflammatory cascade. OxLDL is then taken up by macrophages using anarray of SRs expressed on their surface, such as CD36 and SR-A1 ( Greaves & Gordon, An impaired35 Malondialdehyde Epitopes as Targets of Immunitybalance between cellular uptake and efflux of cholesterol results in the trans- formation of lesional macrophages into lipid-laden foam cells\u2014hallmark cells of atherosclerosis. Consequently, intracellular accumulation of OxLDLresults in the formation of cholesterol crystals that trigger lysosomal ruptureand activation of the inflammasome. In addition, intracellular accumulationof free cholesterol can enhance ER stress and promote an unfolded protein response that triggers apoptosis foam cell macrophages ( Feng et al., 2003 ). Usually, lesional apoptotic cells are silently cleared by professional phago-cytes, but once the efferocytotic mechanism becomes overloaded eitherwith a multitude of apoptotic cells or excess of OxLDL this emanates in impaired clearance of apoptotic cells. Uncleared apoptotic cells then undergo secondary necrosis, lose membrane integrity, and release cellulardebris and DAMPs, further propagating the inflammatory response. Thus,OxLDL, apoptotic cells, and cellular debris accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions and sustain the inflammatory process ( Glass ). Moreover, in addition to innate immune responses adaptive immunity also plays a role in atherogenesis ( Lichtman et al., IFN -secreting Th1 cells\u2014have been found in lesions and were demonstrated to promote atherogenesis. Although B cells arerarely found in lesions, their modulatory roles on atherogenic process haverecently gained much attention. 10. MDA EPITOPES IN ATHEROSCLEROSIS During the oxidative modification of LDL, the phospholipid and cho- lesterol moiety of LDL undergoes lipid peroxidation, which leads thegeneration of many different OSEs, including MDA epitopes. OxLDLhas been shown to be proinflammatory and immunogenic, suggesting that it is a major driver of the inflammatory process during atherogenesis. Indeed, the characterization of OSEs as novel class of DAMPs has provided impor-tant insights into the sterile inflammatory process of atherosclerosis. Accu-mulating evidence suggests that MDA epitopes represent critical mediators of inflammation in atherosclerosis. The fact that atherosclerotic lesions contain MDA epitopes has been known for more than 30 years. Using a monoclonal antibody raised againstMDA-Lys residues, the presence of MDA epitopes was demonstrated in erosclerotic lesions of hyperlipidemic rabbits ( Haberland et al., 1988 ), and later Yla-Herttuala et al. (1989) have shown that LDL in36 N. Papac-Milicevic et al.rabbit and human lesions is in fact oxidized and a major carrier of MDA epi- topes. MDA-modified LDL\u2014in contrast to native LDL\u2014possesses a strong chemotactic potential and can be engulfed more readily by macrophages( Yla-Herttuala et al., 1989 ). Consistent with findings in rabbits and humans, lesions from Apoe/C0//C0mice were shown to contain MDA epitopes in regions rich in macrophages as well as in the necrotic core, which is an area replete with apoptotic cells ( Palinski et al., 1994 ). Possibly, accumulating apoptotic cells prominently contribute to MDA epitopes in atheroscleroticlesions. Indeed, we have recently shown that the levels of plasma MV iso-lated from the culprit lesion site of patients suffering a myocardial infarction are increased and enriched in MDA epitopes compared to plasma MV of the same patients obtained from the periphery ( Tsiantoulas et al., 2015 ). Addi- tionally, it has been shown that HDL isolated from human atherosclerotictissues is enriched in MDA epitopes compared to HDL from plasma of healthy donors. Modification of ApoAI, the major protein moiety of HDL, with MDA in vitro results in dysfunctional HDL. MDA epitopeson ApoAI cause structural and conformational changes, thereby impairingits ability to interact with ABCA1 and promoting cholesterol efflux onto HDL, which is a homeostatic mechanism to remove access cholesterol from macrophages. Thus, oxidative modification of ApoAI by MDA impairs animportant cardioprotective function of HDL, which may also contribute toatherosclerosis development ( Shao et al., 2010 ). Inflammation in vascular lesions is considered a key driver of atherogen- esis. Major carriers of MDA epitopes, such as OxLDL, MV, and dying cells have been shown to possess robust proinflammatory properties, and there isaccumulating evidence that MDA epitopes themselves are mediators ofthese effects. For example, the cytotoxic effect of OxLDL on endothelial cells can be blocked by a polyclonal antibody against MDA but not by a polyclonal antibody against ApoB100. Moreover, it was shown thatMDA epitope-mediated OxLDL cytotoxicity was partially dependenton Akt pathway activity ( Yang et al., 2014 ). Additionally, the direct proinflammatory nature of MDA epitopes has been demonstrated by several groups. As discussed earlier, treatment of THP1 cells with MDA-Lysresulted in strong activation of NF- B activity as well as the activation of signaling pathways related to inflammation, cellular motility, and cell-to-cellsignaling. Furthermore, MDA-Lys also increased monocyte binding to vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells ( Shanmugam et al., ).37 Malondialdehyde Epitopes as Targets of ImmunityAll these cytokines have been shown to play an important in sclerotic promotes leukocyte recruitment to the vas-cular wall and atherosclerosis-prone mice deficient in either Cxcl1 or itsreceptor Cxcr1 develop significantly reduced atherosclerosis. Interestingly,also MDA-carrying were able to induce IL-8 secretion in human monocytes, and this effect could be neutralized in the presence of the MAA-specific IgM NAb LR04, suggesting that MAA epitopes are in partresponsible for the proinflammatory effect of MV ( Tsiantoulas et al., 2015 ). All these data strongly support the fact that MDA epitopes act as DAMPs that modulate lesional inflammation and have a fundamentally important role in the process of atherogenesis. 10.1 MDA Immunization Protects from Atherosclerosis The importance of MDA in atherogenesis has been demonstrated in a largenumber of immunization studies, which showed induction of atheroprotective immunity by immunization with MDA antigens. These studies indicate that endogenously generated MDA is relevant for athero-genesis, as the immune response against MDA specifically mediates protec-tion. For example, immunization of WHHL rabbits with MDA-modified homologous LDL resulted in increased antibody titers to MDA epitopes and atheroprotection, in contrast to Palinski, Miller, & Witztum, 1995 ). Similar atheroprotective effects as well as increased antibody levels were observed in immunization studies ofatherosclerosis-prone Apoe /C0//C0and Ldlr/C0//C0mice MDA-LDL develop high titers of anti-MDA-LDL IgG antibodies and had 50% less lesional area at the aortic sinus compared to con- trol mice injected with PBS ( George et al., 1998 ). Additionally, Ldlr/C0//C0 mice immunized with homologous MDA-LDL or native LDL developed high IgM and IgG titers to MDA-LDL and had attenuated atherosclerosis. Interestingly, immunization with homologous native LDL also protected from atherosclerosis without inducing high titer of antibodies, suggestinga different mechanism for atheroprotection with native LDL ( Freigang et al., 1998 ). Subsequently, seven peptides within human ApoB100 were shown to be immunogenic and were recognized by IgM and IgG autoan- tibodies in human serum N. Papac-Milicevic et al.immunization of Apoe/C0//C0mice with a mixture of two peptides of human ApoB100 (peptides 142 and 210 with 85 -90% similarity to the mouse ApoB100 sequence) resulted in a reduction of plaque area by 60%, incontrast to control immunized mice. Immunization with ApoB100peptides increased IgG titers against MDA-modified peptides, suggestingthat the peptides became modified with MDA in vivo ( Fredrikson et al., 2003 ). The importance of MDA and MAA as a key anti- gen has been demonstrated by the fact that immunization of Apoe/C0//C0mice with plaque homogenates from Apoe/C0//C0mice triggers MDA-specific anti- bodies and reduces lesion formation. More precisely, immunization with MDA-LDL or plaque homogenates led to increased T cell-dependent IgG antibodies recognizing MDA-LDL, the titers of which were foundto negatively correlate with plaque size or serum cholesterol levels ( Zhou et al., 2001 ). In an attempt to identify the exact requirements for the atheroprotective effect of immunization with MDA-LDL, extensive immu- nization studies with different types of related antigens have been per-formed. In these and PBS, and then fed an atherogenic diet for 28 weeks. The most robust reduction in aorticlesion area (40%) compared to PBS control was observed when MAA-MSA was used as an immunogen. Despite similar induction of hapten-specific immune responses with the other antigens, only mice immunized with MDA-LDL and MDA-MSA had a significant reduction of lesion area, albeit to a lesser extent than immunization with MAA-MSA. Notably,immunization with MDA-LDL also induced antibodies that bound toMAA-modified peptides. This observation led to the conclusion that MAA epitopes are the immunodominant epitopes inducing athero- protective immune responses. Thus, MAA hapten-specific immunity medi-ates the protective effect of immunization with MDA-LDL, independent ofthe carrier protein. Several studies tried to characterize the mechanisms responsible for the protective effect of immunization. For example, as discussed earlier, wecould show that immunization of both wild type and atherosclerosis-pronemice with homologous MDA-LDL and MAA-MSA induces a robustTh2-biased immune response that is dominated by MDA-specific IgG1 antibodies ( Binder et al., 2004 ). High titers of antibodies may mediate atheroprotection, as infusion of IEI-E3, a human IgG1 antibody that against MDA-modified peptides human ApoB100, into39 Malondialdehyde Epitopes as Targets of ImmunityApoe/C0//C0mice for 4 weeks resulted in decreased atherosclerotic lesion for- mation compared to infusion of an isotype control ( Schiopu et al., 2007 ). Moreover, infusion of another human recombinant IgG1 (2D03) recogniz-ing the MDA modifications ( al., Using anti-OxLDL IgG that IK17 inhibits the uptake of OxLDL by macrophages in vitro( Shaw et al., 2001 ). In addition, infusion of an adenoviral construct over- expressing recombinant IK17 scFv into cholesterol-fed Ldlr/C0//C0Rag-1/C0//C0 mice resulted formation and reduced ath- erosclerosis ( Tsimikas et al., 2011 ). These antibodies have been suggested to block foam cell formation and protect from atherosclerosis. On the otherhand, Th2 cytokines, such as IL-5 and IL-13, induced by immunization possess important atheroprotective properties. For example, IL-5 stimulates B-1 cells to secrete IgM NAb in a noncognate manner.A large part of IgM NAbs have specificity for OSEs ( Chou et al., 2009 ), and atherosclerosis-prone mice unable to secrete IgM antibodies develop accelerated atherosclerosis ( Lewis et al., 2009 ). in Ldlr/C0//C0mice leads to increased and reduced levels of specific atheroprotective IgM NAb, T15/E06. Furthermore, we alsoshowed that IL-13 protects mice from atherosclerotic lesion formation bypromoting activation of lesional macrophages effi- cient in removal of OxLDL ( Cardilo-Reis et al., 2012 ). Moreover, it has been suggested that immunization with MDA-LDL also induces regulatoryT cells, which could suppress the secretion of the proatherogenic cytokineIFNby specific Th1 cells. Nevertheless, Zhou et al. showed that immuni- zation of CD4 /C0//C0Apoe/C0//C0mice that lack Th cells with homologous MDA- LDL still induced atheroprotection ( Zhou et al., 2005 ). On the other hand, adoptive transfer of CD4+ Th cells from MDA-LDL immunized mice intoApoe /C0//C0SCID mice resulted in accelerated atherosclerosis compared to transfer of T cells from control immunized mice. Thus, the true effects of Th-dependent immunity to MDA-LDL remain to be elucidated in detail.Clearly, a feature common to all immunization studies is the productionof MDA-specific antibodies at much higher levels than the ones occurringnaturally and in the course of diet feeding. In the past 25 years, many epidemiological studies assessed associations of IgG and IgM antibodies to OxLDL and MDA-LDL epitopes with the devel-opment of coronary, carotid, peripheral ( Salonen et al., 2004; Wu et al., 1997 ). These studies have often been very inconsistent due to lack of standardized antigens or assays, and because tested cohorts of patients weresimply too small or not followed prospectively ( Tsimikas et al., 2012 ). Some of these inconsistencies could be overcome with the use of recom-binant peptide mimotopes of MAA that serve as standardized antigens for MAA-specific antibodies ( Amir et al., 2012 ). Nevertheless, studies in humans have provided insights into the role of these immune responsesin CVD. While the role of IgG antibodies to MDA-LDL is less clear,there is now substantial evidence that IgM antibodies to MDA-LDL are inversely associated with atherosclerosis or clinical manifestations thereof ( Gounopoulos, Merki, Hansen, Choi, & Tsimikas, 2007; Tsiantoulas et al., 2014 ). These data suggest that MDA-LDL-specific IgM antibodies may mediate protective functions in atherosclerosis. Interestingly, MDA- specific IgM antibodies have been found to be higher in people younger than 65, females, and nondiabetics ( Fraley et al., 2009; Tsimikas, Lau, et al., 2004 ). Moreover, many if not most IgM antibodies with specificity for MDA-LDL may be IgM NAbs. 10.2 MDA-Specific Natural Immunity Protects from Atherosclerosis As discussed earlier, IgM NAbs are important mediators of MDA-specific immunity, and several potential mechanisms on how they can mediateatheroprotective effects have been suggested. First, IgM with specificityfor MDA/MAA have been shown to act antiinflammatory. We could demonstrate that the MAA-specific IgM NAb LR04 significantly decreased the ability of platelet-derived MV to induce secretion by THP-1 2015 ). IL-8 is a key mediator of leukocyte recruitment to the vascular wall and chief proatherogenic chemokine by endothelial an important modulatory function in atherogenesis. Furthermore,MDA-specific IgM may also protect by promoting clearance of dying cells. Indeed, defective phagocytic clearance of dying cells in atherosclerotic lesions has also been implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis( Tabas, 2010; Van Vre, For example, Ldlr/C0//C0mice reconstituted with bone marrow of mice deficient in the milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 protein (Mfge8/C0//C0), which facilitates PS-mediated clearance of apoptotic cells, developed increased lesion size with more41 Malondialdehyde Epitopes as Targets cells necrotic areas ( Ait-Oufella et al., 2007 ). A similar effect has been observed in Apoe/C0//C0mice also deficient in MER ability of MDA-specific IgM to modulate efferocytosis has been addressed in the studies by Chen et al. (2009) andChou et al. (2009) . For example, incubation of apoptotic thymocytes with wild-type mouse serum in the presence of MDA-BSA resulted in diminished deposi- tion of IgM and C1q on apoptotic cell surfaces and consequently led todecrease in complement-mediated phagocytosis by dendritic cells ( Chen et al., 2009 ). To explain this, the authors suggested that MDA-BSA com- peted for the binding to MDA epitopes on apoptotic cells, on which they may act as hubs for activation of complement-mediated efferocytosis viaIgM and C1q axis. We could directly demonstrate a role for MDA-specificIgM NAbs in apoptotic cell clearance in an in vivo clearance assay in Rag1 /C0//C0mice, deficient apoptotic thymocytes macrophages comparedto apoptotic thymocytes with control IgM ( Chou et al., 2009 ). The importance of this mechanism is further supported by the fact that soluble IgM deficiency ( Lewis et al., 2009 ) as well as C1q deficiency aggravates atherosclerosis in atherosclerosis-prone mice ( Bhatia et al., 2007 ). Thus, MDA epitopes may act as marker of metabolic waste and dying cells in atherosclerotic lesions, allowing the immune system to mediate housekeeping functions ( Chang et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2009; Chou et al., 2009; Weismann et al., 2011 ). Not only IgM antibodies have the capacity to protect from MDA- induced inflammation. Additionally, CFH that colocalizes in human coronary lesions with MDA epitopes has been shown to neutralize MDA-induced expression of proinflammatory genes, including IL-8. Inter-estingly, a few studies have shown an association of 402H allele, whichreduces MDA binding of CFH ( Weismann et 2011 ), with increased cardiovascular risk. However, a metaanalysis of eight different study populations failed to find a significant association of this gene variant withCVDs ( Sofat et al., 2010 ). Nevertheless, additional SNPs of CFH that can affect its capacity to bind MDA have been identified and only functional dataon MDA binding of CFH in plasma may provide insights into a potential association of this CFH function with CVD. In support of this, we could demonstrate that CFH bound on MDA-decorated surfaces still can mediatecofactor activity for Factor I to inactivate C3b into iC3b. turn, Weismann al., 2011 ). Thus, CFH may protect from athero- sclerosis by binding to MDA epitopes, thereby reducing inflammation and additionally increasing opsonization with iC3b, which facilitates effer-ocytosis. Studies in animal models of atherosclerosis may provide criticalinsights into these functions. 11. MDA EPITOPES AS THERAPEUTIC TARGETS IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE Current therapies in CVD mainly aim at lowering LDL plasma levels by increasing the availability of the LDL receptor at the cell surfaceusing, for example, statins or PCSK9 antibodies. Nevertheless, an important contribution of the innate and adaptive immunity to the development of atherosclerosis has become evident. With two ongoing clinical studies, theCanakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS)and the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT), we are cur- rently witnessing a premiere in regard to clinical trials addressing the role of inflammation in CVD. CANTOS and CIRT are the first studies which aim atpreventing recurrent cardiovascular events in patients by reducing inflamma-tion without affecting plasma cholesterol levels using low-dose methotrexate or a neutralizing anti-IL-1 antibody (canakinumab), respectively. Other potentially interesting though preclinical immunomodulatory approachesfor therapeutic intervention in atherosclerosis have been reviewed elsewhere( Amir & Binder, 2010; Lichtman et al., 2013; Miller Lichtman, 2014 ). As OSEs have been implicated as potential antigens triggering innate and adaptive immune responses in atherosclerosis, targeting these structures byactive or passive immunization in order to reduce the inflammatory burdencould provide a novel therapeutic approach to treat atherosclerosis. Indeed, several lines of evidence point toward a protective effect of increasing anti- body titers against OSEs. Interestingly, active immunization using a singleOSE, MDA-LDL as an immunogen is sufficient to protect from athero-sclerosis as demonstrated by a number of studies in animals ( Binder et al., 2004; Freigang et al., 1998; George et al., 1998; Gonen et al., 2014; Palinski et al., 1995; Zhou et al., 2001 ). Even more intriguing is the fact that this protective effect seems to be independent of the carrier presenting MDAepitopes on its surface as several studies showed that immunization using various carrier proteins all modified with MDA epitopes results in less ath- as Targets of 2011 or killed Porphyromonas gingivalis (Turunen et al., 2012 pathogen-carrying surface structures that mimic MDA epitopes. There- fore, the identification of MDA epitopes as critical structures conveyingatheroprotection through immunization could allow for the developmentof more standardized immunogens benefiting from lower variability andthus higher reproducibility. Accordingly, using phage display libraries we have identified an MDA mimotope, the P2 peptide, and demonstrated that immunization with induces MDA-specific antibodies, which bind tohuman atherosclerotic lesions ( Amir et al., 2012 ). On the other hand, several studies reported that passive immunization by therapeutic infusion of anti- MDA antibodies also had beneficial effects by reducing plaque inflammation and regression of atherosclerotic lesions ( Schiopu et al., 2007; Tsimikas et al., 2011 ). Even though animal studies have convincingly shown that vaccina- tion using MDA epitopes is protective in atherosclerosis, translation to human settings has proven to be difficult. Not only do critical differences between rodents and humans exist in terms of lipoprotein metabolism dur-ing atherogenesis, which advises against a direct implementation of exper-imental setups to the clinics, but the ubiquitous presence of MDA epitopes in the body also complicates any human vaccination study because the gen- eration of antibodies against continuously formed MDA epitopes could leadto unwanted side effects of the vaccination in the long term given that westill lack a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved. Meanwhile, other approaches offering protection from pathologically elevated levels of MDA epitopes might be worth of consideration. Several studies demonstrated that endogenous production of natural IgMs can beboosted by treatment ), and IL-5 ( Binder et al., 2004 ), deficiency of sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin G (Siglec G), a negative regulator of the B cell receptor present also on B1a cells ( Hoffmann et al., 2007 ), and by additional strategies yet to be elucidated. While many of these approaches are not spe-cific or even potentially harmful, identification of pathways that specifically regulate IgM NAb production may provide novel therapeutic opportuni- ties. In addition, the MDA-neutralizing properties of CFH could beharnessed for therapeutic purposes as we have shown that CFH protectsfrom MDA-induced inflammation in a mouse model of wet AMD by bind-ing to MDA epitopes ( Weismann et al., 2011 ). Treatment of patients possessing a CFH variant with impaired binding using CFH or truncated CFH constructs which contain only a fraction of the protein includingthe critical MDA-binding region SCR19/20 could help protecting from44 N. Papac-Milicevic et al.MDA-mediated inflammation. Indeed, such constructs, termed mini CFH, have demonstrated their therapeutic potential in mouse models of C3 glomerulopathy ( Nichols et al., 2015 ) and we speculate that their neutraliz- ing capabilities could be also beneficial in atherosclerosis. Regardless of thesuccesses in animal models, the feasibility of these approaches in humanpatients has to be taken with caution as the treatment of a chronic disease that develops over decades might result in long-term complications. Nevertheless, in cases where only short-term treatment is required or forindividuals at high risk, the benefits could outweigh the disadvantages. 12. CONCLUSIONS Lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes results in the generation of various OSEs that act as downstream mediators of oxidative stress in tissues. In this chapter, we have discussed MDA epitopes as a prominent and impor- tant example. This includes evidence that they: (1) are proinflammatorydanger signals for a wide range of cell types, (2) can be recognized by mul-tiple arcs of innate immunity with critical roles in housekeeping functions, and (3) are potent immunogens, which elicit protective immune response in mouse models of atherosclerosis. We speculate that MDA epitopes presenton dying cells and biomolecules damaged by oxidative stress serve as wastemarkers for the immune system, flagging their carriers for complement- mediated rapid and silent clearance by professional phagocytes. However, excessive production of MDA epitopes and/or impaired clearance capabil-ities results in their nonphysiological accumulation and subsequently elicitsproinflammatory responses, which are sustained as long as the carriers ofMDA epitopes cannot be neutralized or scavenged\u2014a condition most likely occurring in many if not all chronic inflammatory diseases that are associated with impaired resolution, such as atherosclerosis.

Humoral immunity is crit- ically dependent on the germinal center where high-affinity memory B cells and plasma cells are generated. In this chapter, we focus on recent advances in our understandingof the molecular mechanisms that govern fate decision for memory B cells and plasmacells and the mechanisms that maintain the long-lived plasma-cell pool, with emphasison how the transcription factor Blimp-1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1)helps regulate the above-mentioned immunoregulatory steps to ensure the productionand maintenance of antibody-secreting plasma cells as well as how it directs memorycell vs plasma-cell fate. We also discuss the molecular basis of Blimp-1 action and how itsexpression is regulated. 1. GERMINAL CENTER 1.1 Initiation of the Germinal Center Reaction A successful establishment of humoral immune response is critical for the clearance of invading pathogen infection and forms the basis of vaccination. Immature B cells are produced in bone marrow and migrate to secondarylymphoid organs where they mature and encounter antigens via B-cellreceptor (BCR). B cells acquire large antigen in the follicle of lymph nodes. The priming of na \u00a8ve B cells with large antigen can be assisted by interaction with dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages located in the subcapsular sinusboundary of lymph nodes or in the marginal zone of the spleen ( Balazs, Martin, Zhou, & Kearney, 2002; Carrasco & Batista, 2007 ). The conduit the basement membrane-like structures ensheathed by fibroblastic reticular cells can deliver small soluble antigens from the afferent lymph to B cells ( Balazs et al., 2002; Roozendaal et al., 2009 ). After encountering antigens that were either in soluble form or presented byantigen-presenting cells ( Batista & Harwood, 2009 ), B cells process antigens and move to the T-B border, where B cells interact with T follicular helper (Tfh) cells via contact between peptide-MHC class II complexes on antigen-primed B cells and the antigen-specific T-cell IFN- , to induce the B B-cell al., 2008 ). In addition, pre-GC Tfh cells express a unique panel of effector molecules, including CD40L, ICOS, and cytoplasmic adaptor protein SLAM-associated protein (SAP), that B-cell activa- tion, differentiation, and survival ( Ma, Deenick, ).62 Y.-H. Yu and K.-I. LinSpecifically, CD40L promotes ( Tangye, Deenick, Palendira, & Ma, 2012 between ICOS on Tfh cells and ICOSL on B cells facilitates the expressionof certain key Tfh-associated molecules, such as IL-21 ( Bauquet et al., 2009 ), which acts in an autocrine manner to maintain Tfh-cell homeostasis.SAP is crucial for the establishment of a stable interaction between Tfh cells and antigen-primed B cells ( Qi, Cannons, Klauschen, Schwartzberg, & Germain, 2008 ). The interaction between antigen-primed B cells and pre- GC Tfh cells also triggers cytokine singling pathways isotypes of class-switch recombination (CSR) in GC, depending on the types of cytokine released by Tfh cells ( McHeyzer- Williams et al., 2012 ). After contacting Tfh cells, activated B cells either enter the GC reaction or move to extrafollicular medullary cords to become short-lived plasma cells that secrete antibody with low affinity against invading pathogens (Jacob & Kelsoe, 1992 ). Short-lived plasma cells express germline transcripts cells survive for only 3 -5 days ( McHeyzer- Williams & McHeyzer-Williams, 2005 ), they produce early protective anti- bodies during infection. Antigen-specific B cells that are committed to GCprecursors subsequently move toward the center of follicles in an orphanG protein-coupled receptor EBI-2-dependent manner and Paus, & Cyster, 2009 ), which results in the formation of the early GC. As vigorous proliferation of GC B cells precedes, the GC increasesin size and is polarized into two microenvironments composed of a dark zone and light zone. B cells in the dark zone and light zone show distinct surface markers: the dark-zone B cells are CXCR4 hiCD83loCD86lo, whereas the light-zone B cells are CXCR4loCD83hiCD86hi. B cells in the dark zone are known as centroblasts whose extensive proliferation, rang- ing from 6 to 12 h to complete a cell cycle ( MacLennan, 1994 ), initiates SHM that further increases the diversification of their IgV genes. Dark-zoneB cells have distinct gene expression profiles that underlie increased expres-sion of cell-cycle regulators and proapoptotic factors but downregulatedexpression of negative regulators of the cell cycle and antiapoptotic factors ( Klein & Dalla-Favera, 2008; Klein et al., 2003 ). B cells in the light zone, called centrocytes, exit the cell cycle and are smaller in size. In additionto B cells, several other cell types including Tfh, follicular DCs, and63 Generation of Antibody-Secreting Plasma Cellsmacrophages ( De Silva & Klein, 2015 ) are also present in the light zone. The expression of CXCR5 along with loss of the T-cell zone-homing chemo- kine CCR7 permits antigen-specific move from theT-cell zone to the GC, which provides essential help for the maturationand differentiation of GC B cells ( Hardtke, Ohl, & Forster, 2005 ). Antigen held by follicular DCs can be taken up by GC B cells, after which these cells further process and present the antigen to Tfh cells ( El Shikh & Pitzalis, from those cells\u2014particularly antigen-specific Tfh cells\u2014centrocytes undergo affinity maturation based on of theirmutated IgV genes, whereby high-affinity BCR variants are selected to differentiate into memory B cells or plasma cells ( Chan & Brink, 2012 ). Centrocytes that express higher affinity BCR transduce signaling pathwaysserve to protect against apoptosis ( Liu et al., 1989 ), and the selected cen- trocytes can reenter the dark zone to reinitiate cell division and undergo additional cycles of SHM, a process known as \"cyclic reentry\" ( Victora et 2010 ). by the biphasic expression of c-Myc in GC B cells, and this expression is suppressed in centroblasts,but c-Myc is reexpressed in a dark-zone reentry ( Dominguez-Sola et al., 2012 ). 1.2 Molecules Important for GC Generation and Function The formation of GC and the GC reaction is regulated by several keymolecules, such as B-cell (AID). proto-oncogene frequently expressed in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ( Ye et al., 1993 ). BCL-6 is a member of the BTB/ POZ/zinc-finger family transcription factors ( Basso & Dalla-Favera, 2012 ). Upregulation of BCL-6 is essential for the formation of the GC, maintenance of GC B-cell genomic integrity, and prevention of prematuredifferentiation of ( Fukuda et al., 1997; Phan, Saito, Kitagawa, 2007; Shaffer et al., 2000 ). BCL-6 binds to thousands of genes in GC B cells including those involved in B-cellactivation, survival, DNA-damage response, cell-cycle arrest, cytokine sig-naling, Toll-like and differentiation ( Basso et al., 2010 ). The expression of BCL-6 can be initiated in antigen-experienced GC B precursors, and this is crucial for sustaining the cognate interactions with pre-GC Tfh cells and for their entry into the center of follicles ( Kitano et al., 2011 ). In addition to its importance in GC B cells, BCL-6 is required for the generation of Tfh cells ( Johnston et al., 2009; Nurieva ). Recent64 Y.-H. Yu and K.-I. Lingenome-wide analysis of target genes directly bound by BCL-6 in Tfh cells revealed that BCL-6 pathways with the transcription fac-tor, activator protein 1 (AP-1), and targeting to the loci ( Hatzi et al., 2015 ). IRF4 is necessary for the formation of the GC, and mice lacking Irf4have an impaired GC and are defective for plasma-cell generation ( Mittrucker et al., 1997 ); specifically, loss of Irf4in mature B-cell stages abrogates GC formation in response to T cell-dependent (TD) antigen immunization andListeria major infection ( Willis et al., 2014 ). The function of IRF4 in ini- tiation of the GC and temporally in aconcentration-dependent manner Ochiai al., 2013 ), and tion of Irf4induces the generation of BCL-6-expressing GC B cells in vivo, whereas strong BCR signaling triggered by increased antigen affinity causes high expression of IRF4, which promotes the generation of plasma cells.IRF4 is also essential for Tfh-cell formation ( Bollig et al., 2012 ). AID was first identified by subtractive hybridization cloning of cDNAs expressed in mouse CH12F3 lymphoma cells that had been induced to undergo CSR ( Muramatsu et al., 1999 ). Mice deficient in Aicda , the gene encoding AID, show a complete blockage of SHM and CSR germline occur nor- mally ( Muramatsu et al., 2000 ). Patients deficient in AID display hyper-IgM syndrome and suffer from recurrent infections ( Revy et al., 2000 ). AID directly converts cytosine into uracil (U) in single-stranded target DNAof both IgS IgV regions ( AID-mediated deamination can be repairedin a number of ways, leading to the generation of transition/transversionmutations in the IgV region in SHM or DNA double-strand breaks in the S region of the IgH gene in CSR ( Keim, Kazadi, Rothschild, & 2006 ). In addition, epigenetic regulation has also been implicated in GC forma- tion function. EZH2, which catalyzes methylation of lysine 27 ofhistone 3, is essential for the generation of the GC ( Beguelin et al., 2013 ). Mice carrying an Ezh2 deletion in postswitched GC B cells show a loss of proliferative GC B cells and impaired immunoglobulin affinitymaturation that results in reduced formation of high-affinity antibodiesfollowing immunization.65 Generation of Antibody-Secreting Plasma Cells2. PLASMA CELLS 2.1 Generation of Plasma Cells The switch from the membrane-bound form of Ig to the secreted Ig form characterizes the terminal differentiation of B cells into plasmablasts, which will eventually mature into noncycling plasma cells. The generation of antibody-secreting plasma cells is initiated by the exposure of matureB cells to a T cell-independent (TI) and TD antigen. Plasma cells generatedby TD antigen can be produced by either extrafollicular or GC responses. Inthe case of an extrafollicular response, T cells outside the follicle, ie, extrafollicular T helper cells, support the proliferation and differentiation of plasmablasts in an IL-21- and ICOS-dependent manner ( Odegard et al., 2008 ). In collaboration with extrafollicular T cells, DCs located in extrafollicular regions also promote the production of switched or unswitched plasmablasts by expressing B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) that can low-density lipoprotein proteins ( Joo et al., 2014 ). The strength of antigen recognition by BCR determines the pathway choice of antigen-experienced B cells to differen-tiate into either extrafollicular or GC plasmablasts ( Paus et al., 2006 ). High- affinity or abundant antigens direct B cells to differentiate into extrafollicular plasma cells, whereas low-affinity antigens instruct B cells to undergo GC reactions by which high-affinity clones can be selected by affinity matura-tion. In GC responses, a subset of GC B express partial ( Angelin-Duclos, Cattoretti, Lin, & Calame, 2000 ). It has been proposed that plasma-cell fate is determined by the affinity of BCR for antigens in the GC rather than stochastic selection from GC B cells (Phan et al., 2006 ). High-affinity GC B cells are more likely to form plasma cells. However, other reports have also provided evidence that cytokine-driven stochastic division regulates the generation of IgG-secreting plasma Duffy et al., recent transcriptome analysis of differen- tial gene expression profiles of dividing B cells stimulated to undergo plasma-cell differentiation showed that the expression of plasma-cell-specific genes was accordingly initiated beginning with initiation of the cell cycle ( Shi et al., 2015 ).66 Y.-H. Yu and K.-I. Lin2.2 Molecular Signatures of Plasma Cells Plasma cells express unique surface markers that are distinct from those of B cells. Many B-cell-specific surface proteins, including MHC class II, B220, CD19, ( Sanderson, Lalor, & Bernfield, 1989 ). Plasma cells emigrating from the GC begin to express CXCR4, which prompts the cells to home to splenic red pulp, lymph-nodemedullary cords, and bone marrow ( Hargreaves et al., 2001 ). With regard to intracellular proteins whose expression level changes during plasma-celldifferentiation, sequential waves of functionally related proteins have been demonstrated to be differentially expressed: mitochondrial and cytosolic chaperones are induced first, followed by a surge in expression of meta-bolic enzymes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident folding factors, 2003 ). Metabolomics analysis of metabolic profiling in extracellular medium of plasma cells has shown that the metabolome of the antibody-secreting phase is characterized bydecreased use of glucose, sustained consumption of glutamine, and releaseof glutamate and alanine ( Garcia-Manteiga et al., 2011 ). The transition from activated B cells to plasma cells requires the coordinated regulation of gene expression governed by several key transcription factors, includingthose that drive plasma-cell differentiation, such as B lymphocyte-inducedmaturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), IRF4, and X box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), and drivers, such as PAX5, BCL-6, BACH2, IRF8, and PU.1. Aside from these key transcriptionfactors, plasma cells express a unique panel of transcription factors thatgovern their cellular functions; these factors include members of theAP-1, NF- B, NFAT, and octamer-binding factor families ( Underhill, George, Bremer, & Kansas, 2003 ). 2.3 Key Transcription Factors in Plasma-Cell Differentiation The discovery that Blimp-1 functions in the B-cell lineage will be discussed in more detail in Section 4 . Pax5 is expressed throughout B-cell develop- ment Busslinger, in stimulated67 Generation of Antibody-Secreting Plasma CellsB cells prohibits the generation of plasma cells ( Lin, Angelin-Duclos, Kuo, & Calame, 2002; Usui et al., 1997 ); conversely, loss of Pax5 in the chicken cell line DT40 is sufficient to induce IgM secretion ( Nera et or 283 abrogates Pax5-dependent suppression of Prdm1 (Yasuda et al., 2012 ). Transcription of XBP-1 is also suppressed by Pax5, whose down- regulation during plasma-cell differentiation may at least partly contributeto the induction of XBP-1 ( Reimold et al., 1996 ). In addition to regulating genes involved in facilitating GC functions, BCL-6 suppresses plasma-cell differentiation at least partly by directly suppressing the transcription ofPrdm1 ( Shaffer et al., 2000; Tunyaplin BCL-6 is phosphorylation by MAPK, leading to its degradation via theubiquitin/proteasome pathway ( Niu, Ye, & Dalla-Favera, 1998 ) Accordingly, LPS-stimulated knockout ofBcl-6 in splenic B cells leads to enhancement of their differentiation into CD138+Ig-secreting cells ( Tunyaplin et al., 2004 ). Recently, the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex was shown to interact with BCL-6 torepress Prdm1 ( Choi, Jeon, Choi, Park, & Seong, 2015 ). Mice lacking the core component of SWI/SNF complex in the B-cell lineage exhibit impaired GC reactions and increased expression of Blimp-1 ( Choi et al., 2015 ). BACH2 is highly expressed from the pro-B to mature B-cell stages through the transcriptional activation by Pax5 ( Schebesta et al., 2007 BACH2 is downregulated in plasma cells ( Muto et al., 1998, 2010 ). BACH2 is also a critical regulator of CSR and SHM ( Muto et al., 2004 ). Mice lacking Bach2 show impaired IgG responses after immunization with TI or TD anti- gen. PRDM1 is an important BACH2 target ( Ochiai et al., 2006 ). In the absence of BACH2, more IgM-secreting plasma cells are produced in stim- ulated mouse splenic B-cell cultures, which correlate with Muto et al., ). IRF8 Aicda (Carotta et al., 2014 ). Deletion of both Irf8andPU.1 in B cells synergistically enhances the production of Ig-secreting plasma cells as compared with B cells lacking either Irf8orPU.1 . Aside from the aforementioned function of IRF4 in GC formation, IRF4 drives plasma-cell differentiation. Mice of Irf4in GC68 Y.-H. Yu and K.-I. LinB cells that have undergone IgG1 CSR manifest complete loss of IgG1- producing plasma cells ( Klein et al., 2006 ). IRF4 activates Prdm1 by directly binding to Prdm1 the plasma-cell gene expression program, and reintroduction of Blimp-1 into IRF4-deficient B cells restores antibody production( Sciammas et al., 2006 ). Recently, IRF4 was shown to upregulate ZBTB20, a BCL-6 homolog that facilitates the generation of plasma cells ( Chevrier et al., 2014 ). The action of IRF4 in gene regulation requires cooperation with other transcription factors. For instance, IRF4 targets AP-1/IRF com-posite elements via interaction with the basic leucine-zipper transcriptional factor ATF-like (BATF), which is an AP-1 family transcription factor, in B cells ( Glasmacher et al., 2012; Ochiai et al., 2013 ). Interestingly, genome- wide analysis of the binding motif of IRF4 revealed that IRF4 preferentiallybinds to the interferon sequence response element motif in plasma cells to activate the gene expression program associated with plasma cells ( Ochiai et al., 2013 ), suggesting that IRF4 concentration determines GC vs plasma- cell fate by targeting a distinct motif in target genes. XBP-1 not only is a critical transcription factor controlling the secretion of antibodies by plasma cells but also plays an important role in the unfolded protein response. Most secreted proteins fold correctly upon disulfide-bondformation and upon being properly modified by posttranslational N-linkedglycosylation in the ER lumen. When the level of misfolded proteinsexceeds the ER capacity, the unfolded protein response may be triggered; this allows the ER to either expand protein folding capacity or initiate apo- ptosis ( Ron & Walter, 2007 ). Upon ER stress, inositol-requiring kinase 1 is activated, leading to the excision of an intron from XBP-1 pre-mRNA and a translational frameshift that results in the production of an alternatively spliced form of XBP-1 with increased transcriptional activity ( Calfon et 2001 ). This XBP-1 mRNA is rapidly induced in vitro by stimuli that are able to triggerplasma-cell differentiation and is required for the generation of antibody- secreting plasma cells ( Iwakoshi et al., 2003; Reimold al., 2001; Todd et al., 2009 ). Specifically, XBP-1 is important for the generation of plasma cells in the late phase of B-cell maturation, as B-cell-specific Xbp-1 knockout mice manifest substantially reduced Ig production but display normal induc-tion of the plasma-cell marker CD138 ( Todd et al., 2009 ). Although the upregulation of XBP-1 level during plasma-cell differentiation has been proposed to be linked with the unfolded protein response resulting frommassive and improperly folded Ig ( Iwakoshi et al., 2003 ), it has been69 Generation of Antibody-Secreting Plasma Cellsdemonstrated that B cells that fail to secrete IgM still upregulate XBP-1 normally following stimulation to induce plasma-cell differentiation (Hu, Dougan, McGehee, Love, & Ploegh, 2009 ). XBP-1 increases content, mitochondrial mass and function, ribosome number, andgeneral protein synthesis at least in part by regulating genes encodingsecretory pathway components ( Shaffer et al., 2004 ). 2.4 Maintenance of Plasma Cells After leaving secondary lymphoid organs, plasmablasts, the dividing antibody-secreting cells, circulate in blood and migrate to bone marrow where they are exposed to survival factors necessary to further differen-tiate into long-lived plasma cells ( Radbruch et al., 2006 ). It has been demonstrated that phenotypically distinct plasma-cell precursors can be found in mouse bone marrow 2 weeks after immunization ( O'Connor, Cascalho, & Noelle, 2002 ); proliferation of these precursors is required for the generation of long-lived plasma cells. Plasmablasts and plasma cellscan be distinguished based on the fact that plasma cells express a relatively higher level of Blimp-1 ( Kallies et al., 2004 ). The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is important for plasma-cell homing to bone marrow and for inter-action with stromal cells that express CXCL12 (CXCR4 ligand), whichenables the Egawa, Sugiyama, Choi, & Nagasawa, 2004 ). Specifically, IgG+plasma cells are associated with CXCL12hireticular cells in bone marrow. CD28 is expressed on all plasma cells, including splenic short-lived plasma cellsand bone marrow long-lived plasma cells. However, CD28 selectively sup-ports the survival of bone marrow long-lived plasma cells but not splenic short-lived plasma cells. Additionally, bone marrow CXCL12 hireticular cells express CD80, the CD28 ligand, which further provides long-livedplasma cells with the CD28-driven survival signal upon interaction withreticular cells ( Rozanski et al., 2011 ). Other cells and chemokines in bone marrow also play important roles in supporting plasma-cell survival. An in vivo study showed that APRIL and itsreceptor, B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), are required for plasma-cellmaintenance ( Benson et al., 2008 ). However, the expression of APRIL is low on CXCL12hireticular cells, but the bone marrow resident eosinophils, megakaryocytes, and monocytes express high levels of APRIL and CXCL12 (Belnoue et al., 2012; Chu et al., 2011; Winter et al., 2010 ). In addition to APRIL, IL-6 is also expressed by these cells in bone marrow to sustain70 Y.-H. Yu and K.-I. Linplasma-cell survival ( Belnoue et al., 2012; Chu et al., 2011; Winter et al., 2010 ). Other studies also have indicated that long-lived plasma cells in bone marrow can be sustained by BAFF, APRIL, and IL-6 in vitro, which is asso-ciated with the enhanced expression of the antiapoptotic protein, myeloidcell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), in plasma cells ( O'Connor et al., 2004 ). Accord- ingly, mice lacking BCMA, the receptor for BAFF, show reduced capacity to maintain long-lived plasma cells in bone marrow after immunization with TD antigen ( O'Connor et al., 2004 ). In addition, CD93 is expressed during early B-cell development but is reinduced during plasma-cell differentiation.Cd93 -deficient mice are unable to maintain antibody production and the numbers of plasma cells in bone marrow, suggesting that CD93 also partic- ipates in plasma-cell maintenance in the bone marrow niche ( Chevrier et al., 2009 ). B-cell intrinsic transcription factors also support the survival of long- lived plasma cells. The number of plasma cells in bone marrow is reduced when Blimp-1 is deleted after immunization with TD antigen ( Shapiro- Shelef, Lin, Savitsky, Liao, -POZ transcription factor ZBTB20, which is expressed in GC B cells but is most highly expressed in long-lived plasma cells, is also essential for the maintenance of long-lived plasma cells and for durable antibody responses ( Chevrier et al., 2014; Wang & Bhattacharya, 2014 ). ZBTB20 is regulated by IRF4 and antagonizes the effect of BCL-6 to promote plasma-cell differentiationand longevity. Activation of APRIL-mediated BCMA signaling increases the expression of Mcl-1, which controls bone marrow plasma-cell survival ( Peperzak et al., 2013 ). Aiolos, one of the Ikaros family members, is essential for plasma-cell generation. Aiolos-deficient mice fail to generate high-affinity plasma cells in bone marrow and to sustain serum antibody titers after immunization, yet SHM and the generation of both memory B cells and short-lived high-affinity plasma cells in the spleen appear to be normal( Cortes & Georgopoulos, 2004 ). 3. MEMORY B CELLS 3.1 Properties of Memory B Cells Memory B cells have several unique features including long lifespan, high sensitivity to low doses of antigen, quick and robust proliferation, and rapiddifferentiation into plasma cells that produce high-affinity antibodies during the secondary response. CD27 is a marker for human memory B cells ( Klein, Rajewsky, & Kuppers, 1998 ). These CD27+memory B also express71 Generation of Antibody-Secreting Plasma CellsIgM or isotype-switched Ig. However, CD27 is not an appropriate marker for mouse memory B cells ( Anderson, Tomayko, Ahuja, Haberman, & Shlomchik, 2007 ). and program cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2, also called CD273) were identified as markers for mousememory B cells and are expressed at different levels among different subsets( Tomayko, Steinel, Anderson, & Shlomchik, 2010 ). Based on the levels of CD80, CD73, PD-L2, at least five phenotypic subsets of murine mem- ory B cells can be defined, regardless of whether IgM or class-switched Ig isexpressed ( Tomayko et al., 2010 ). The heterogeneity within the murine memory B-cell compartment represents the distinct types of memory B cells with different ontology and maturity ( Tomayko et al., 2010 ). Other reports have also shown that Fc-like receptor proteins 2 and 4 are predom-inantly expressed by human memory B cells ( Davis, 2007 ). Memory B cells can survive for long periods and can induce faster and stronger humoral responses when they reencounter the same antigen ( Pape, Taylor, Maul, Gearhart, & Jenkins, 2011 ), in contrast to plasma cells that provide the first line of protection against infection but do not respond to the second infec-tion because of low expression of membrane-bound and tonsil are the major reservoirs for antigen-specific human memory B cells, they appearto be dispensable for preserving immunological memory following areencounter with antigen ( Giesecke et al., 2014 ). 3.2 Generation of Memory B Cells In general, memory B cells expressing class-switched and high-affinityBCRs develop within the GC ( MacLennan, 1994 ), but growing evidence also indicates the existence of GC-independent memory B cells ( Anderson et al., 2007; Kaji et al., 2012; Taylor, Pape, & unswitched Rajewsky, 1997; Pape et al., 2011 ). Memory B cells from the GC-independent pathway express unmutated and low-affinity BCR. The requirement of BCL-6 for the GC reaction has been utilized to inves-tigate the generation of GC-independent memory B cells ( Kaji et al., 2012; Toyama et al., 2002 ). Mice that receive memory B cells derived from Bcl-6/C0//C0donors can still produce antigen-specific IgM or isotype-switched (sw) Ig(G, A, or E) to a lesser extent, whereas mice that receive B cells from wild-type mice produce substantial IgM and sw Ig memory B cells ( Taylor et al., 2012 ).72 Y.-H. Yu and K.-I. LinTo generate TD memory B cells, antigen-activated B cells migrate to the borders of the B-cell and T-cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs and form stable interactions with cognate pre-GC Tfh cells to receive helper sig-nals ( Qi et al., 2008 ). Cognate B cells then migrate to the outer follicles and proliferate, where some of them differentiate into short-lived plasma cells( McHeyzer-Williams & McHeyzer-Williams, 2005 ) and some of the others develop into memory B cells ( Anderson et al., 2007; Kaji et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2012 ). These memory B cells produced early during an immune response in the extrafollicular area are called GC-independent memoryB cells. However, certain B cells that have encountered Tfh cells reenter the B-cell follicle to form the dark zone of the GC, where they undergo clonal expansion and SHM of BCR. After exiting the cell cycle, GCB cells with diverse BCR affinities migrate to the light zone to undergoaffinity selection via interaction with antigen-presenting follicular DCs and cognate Tfh cells. The affinity-matured then exit the GC to become long-lived post-GC plasma cells or memory B cells, the latterof which are also called GC-dependent memory B cells ( McHeyzer- Williams & McHeyzer-Williams, 2005 ). The signals required for prememory B-cell exit from GC cycle are still largely unknown, but main- tenance of the specificity of memory B-cell subsets is dependent on tran-scriptional regulation ( Wang et al., 2012 ). Conditional ablation of T-bet revealed that T-bet is required for generating IgG2a+memory B cells and steady-state survival, whereas ROR is required for survival of IgA+mem- ory B cells ( Wang et al., 2012 ). Distinct from B2 cells, such as marginal zone and follicular B cells, B1 cells are a self-renewing subset of mature B cells that are predominately pre-sent in the peritoneal and pleural cavities. B1 cells can also generate memory B cells by a TI pathway ( Alugupalli et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2012b ). tularensis live- vaccine strain, B1-a memory cells arise in spleen and then rap-idly migrate to the peritoneal cavity. Following FtL rechallenge, these memory B cells remigrate to the spleen and produce anti-FtL IgM ( Yang et al., 2012a, 2012b ). 3.3 Regulation of Memory B-Cell Formation By which mechanism is memory B-cell fate determined? Little is knownabout the intrinsic mechanisms that are essential for the formation of mem- ory B cells. The search for master regulators of transcription that control memory B-cell fate via gene expression profiling has proved challenging.73 Generation of Antibody-Secreting Plasma CellsIn the GC-independent memory B-cell pathway, CD40 signaling provided by pre-GC Tfh cells alone is sufficient to induce activated B cells to differ- entiate into memory B cells but not GC B cells ( Taylor et al., 2012 ). IL-21 signaling provided by cognate T cells upregulates the expression of BCL-6 inB cells ( Linterman et al., 2010 ). This suggests that the duration of conjugate formation can steer activated B cells to become GC B cells with adequate T-cell help or become GC-independent memory B cells with a lower level support ( Kurosaki, Kometani, & Ise, 2015 ). In addition, some reports have defined the mechanisms that govern the size of memory B cells in vivo. Forinstance, studies focusing on the function of the BCL-2 family in B-cell homeostasis have revealed that this family is a major regulator of memory B-cell survival, and therefore, BCL-2 is a key molecule that controlshumoral responses ( Clybouw et al., 2011; Takahashi, Ohta, & Takemori, 2001 ). Activated human B cells express higher levels of the p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and proapoptotic factors BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) but a lower level ofthe prosurvival factor BCL-2 compared with resting B cells or memoryB cells. Overexpression of BCL-2 or deletion of BIM or PUMA leads to an increase in size of the memory B-cell compartment ( Clybouw et al., 2011; Fischer et al., 2007; Takahashi et al., 2001 ). In addition, Syk, the key signal transducer in BCR-mediated signaling in mature B cells, isneeded for the survival of memory B cells ( Ackermann et al., 2015 ). Thus, it is likely that memory B cells are supported by multiple signaling pathways that promote survival ( Kurosaki et al., 2015 ). It is also conceivable that memory B cells need to adopt an intrinsic mechanism that can ensure theirlong-term survival. Ongoing autophagy and limited cell death are character-istic of memory B cells, which ensure the long-term maintenance of mem- ory B-cell pools ( Chen et al., 2014 ). During acute viral infection, the generation of viral antigen-specific memory B cells can be inhibited bythe perforin-dependent effects of natural killer cells on the suppression ofCD4 T cells and Tfh cells ( Rydyznski et al., 2015 ). In the context of transcriptional regulation, signal transducer and activa- tor of transcription 5 (STAT5) is activated in human GC B cells, leading tothe induction of BCL-6, which may facilitate the commitment to memoryB cells by providing memory B cells with self-renewal properties ( Scheeren et al., 2005 ). However, BCL-6 is not expressed in memory B cells, and its expression was found to decrease significantly in an in vitro human memory B-cell differentiation culture system ( Kuo et al., 2007 ). Moreover, ectopic expression of BCL-6 in human memory B-cell differentiation cultures74 Y.-H. Yu and K.-I. Linresults in formation of fewer memory B cells, demonstrating that repres- sion of BCL-6 is required for memory B-cell differentiation. A recent study also indicated that epigenetic regulation plays a role in memory B-cell dif- ferentiation. deletion a histone acetyltransferase, could alter cell-fate decisions in both primary and secondary immune responses ( Good-Jacobson et al., 2014 ). The absence of MOZ in B cells impairs dark-zone generation with a concomitant decrease in both cell-cycle progression and BCL-6 expres- sion, yet the differentiation to IgM and low-affinity IgG+memory B cells is enhanced. 3.4 Activated B-Cell Factor-1 Promotes the Generation of Memory B Cells We recently showed that the basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repres- sor, activated B-cell factor-1 (ABF-1), is prevalently expressed in purified mouse and human memory B cells, and its expression is suppressed by Blimp-1 ( Chiu et al., 2014 )(Fig. 1 ). ABF-1 was identified by yeast two- hybrid analysis using the basic helix-loop-helix region of E2-2, another basic helix-loop-helix E protein member, as a bait. ABF-1 expression is restricted to human lymphoid tissue, fetal liver, bone marrow, activated B cells, and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell lines ( Massari et al., 1998 ). ABF-1 can form homodimers or a heterodimer with the E protein E12 or E47, which then facilitates its binding to the E box DNA element, resulting in the repression of E47-mediated transcriptional activity ( Massari et al., y cellBlimp-1 FLI1 ABF-1ProliferationTfh cell- mediated signals Fig. 1 ABF-1 promotes the generation of memory B cells. In mature B cells, ABF-1 is induced by T follicular helper (Tfh) cell-mediated signals to promote memory B-cell fate. ABF-1 downregulates the expression of FLI1 to repress cell proliferation and prevents plasma-cell fate. In plasma cells, the expression of ABF-1 is suppressed by Blimp-1.75 Generation of Antibody-Secreting Plasma CellsABF-1 coordinates with the protein ID2 to suppress certain B-cell-specific genes by antagonizing the activity of E2A ( Mathas et al., 2006 ). Additionally, B cells treated with Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan or IL-2 express ABF- 1, linking its function to B-cell activation ( Massari et al., 1998 ). of ABF-1 is MyoR (or Musculin, Msc), which is named for its abil-ity to repress myogenesis. Msc is expressed in undifferentiated myoblasts and is downregulated during differentiation in vitro ( Lu, Webb, Richardson, & Olson, 1999 ). We showed that ectopic expression of ABF-1 prevents the production of antibody-secreting plasma cells in an in vitro differentiationsystem derived from stimulating CD27 +human blood memory B cells with IL-21 and anti-CD40. Conversely, knockdown of ABF-1 potentiates the formation antibody-secreting cells. A transgenic mouse model thatexpresses inducible ABF-1 after immunization with TD antigen demon-strated that overexpression of ABF-1 during an immune response facilitates the generation of GC and antigen-specific memory B cells but blocks the production of antibody-secreting plasma cells. When we searched forABF-1 target genes via microarray analysis, we found that ABF-1 down-regulates the expression of FLI1 , which accelerates cell proliferation ( Truong & Ben-David, 2000 ). Consistent with this result, overexpression or knockdown of ABF-1 in human memory B cells results in reduced orenhanced proliferation, respectively. It is plausible that ABF-1-mediatedsuppression of FLI1 may at least partly explain why memory B cells manifest cell-cycle arrest ( Anderson, Hannum, & Shlomchik, 2006 ). 4. BLIMP-1 IS A KEY REGULATOR OF PLASMA-CELL DIFFERENTIATION 4.1 Functional Roles of Blimp-1 in B Cells Blimp-1, initially named PRDI-BF1 (positive regulatory domain I-binding factor 1), was discovered as a transcriptional repressor of IFN- in response to virus infection of human osteosarcoma cell line ( Keller & Maniatis, 1991 ). Blimp-1 is a conserved transcription factor for which homologs Blimp-1 not only plays critical roles in embryonic development of multiple speciesbut also controls the differentiation and function of many cell lineages inadult mice ( Bikoff, Morgan, & Robertson, 2009 ).76 Y.-H. Yu and K.-I. LinBlimp-1 was originally cloned by a subtractive hybridization screen using cDNA from a mouse BCL-1 lymphoma cell line that had been treated with IL-2 and IL-5 ( Turner, Mack, & Davis, ectopic expres- sion of Blimp-1 in BCL-1 cells is sufficient to drive the generation of IgM-secreting plasma cells. One study that used immunohistochemistry to detectBlimp-1 expression in lymphoid tissues following immunization revealed that Blimp-1 is expressed in plasma cells derived from either TI or TD immunization in spleen and in long-lived plasma cells in bone marrow( Angelin-Duclos et al., 2000 ). Studies using reporter mice carrying the GFP gene inserted at the Prdm1 locus showed that heterozygous mice expressed GFP in antibody-secreting cells following immunization and that bone marrow long-lived plasma cells expressed higher levels of Blimp-1 thanthe plasmablasts detected in the spleen ( Kallies et al., 2004 ). The importance of Blimp-1 in plasma-cell differentiation is demonstrated by the phenotypes observed in B-cell-specific Prdm1 conditional knockout mice ( Shapiro- Shelef et al., 2003 ). Mice with B-cell-specific deletion of Prdm1 undergo normal B-cell development but fail to produce plasma cells and secrete Igfollowing immunization with TI or TD antigens, with concomitant enhancement of the generation of GC B cells in the case of immunization with TD antigen. The production of B220 loCD138+plasma cells in Prdm1 - deficient mice is impaired after immunization with TD antigen ( Shapiro- Shelef et al., 2003 ). The NP+CD79b+B220/C0CD138/C0preplasma memory B cells are greatly reduced, but NP+B220+CD138/C0memory B cells are not affected in B-cell-specific Prdm1 -deleted mice ( Shapiro-Shelef et al., 2003 ). An ex vivo study using Blimp-1-deficient B cells stimulated with LPS revealed that those cells proliferate more vigorously than control cellsbut produce little IgM-secreting cells and B220 intCD138+plasma cells (Shapiro-Shelef et al., 2003 ). In addition, Blimp-1 is required for antibody secretion by B1 cells, a peritoneal B-cell subset that contributes to the gen-eration of circulating natural antibodies for protection against bacterial andviral infection ( Savitsky & Calame, 2006 ). Although Blimp-1 is essential for the generation and maintenance of plasma cells, it is not required for the ini- tiation of the commitment of plasma-cell fate ( Kallies et al., 2007 ). Besides, Blimp-1 not only is required for the generation of plasma cells but also needsto be continuously expressed in long-lived plasma cells in bone marrow tomaintain these populations ( Shapiro-Shelef et al., 2005 ). Inducible deletion ofPrdm1 in vivo following immunization results in the loss of plasma cells in bone marrow and reduced titers of antigen-specific IgG1 in serum ( Shapiro- 2005 ). It turns out that Blimp-1 maintains the survival of plasma77 Generation of Antibody-Secreting Plasma Cellscells, at least in part, by directly suppressing the proapoptotic gene ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) by binding to 250 bp upstream of the transcription start site ( Lin et al., 2012 ). ASK1 is activated in vitro fol- lowing treatment of mouse splenic B cells with LPS or cytokine-mimickingTI or TD stimuli-mediated generation of short-lived plasma cells, respec-tively, which may partly account for the short lifespan of short-lived plasma cells. More importantly, not only antigen-specific short-lived cells but also long-lived plasma cells generated by immunization accumulate in ASK1 - deficient mice. Thus, long-lived plasma cells may require sustained suppres-sion of ASK1 by Blimp-1 to avert stress-induced apoptosis. Blimp-1 is also important for the survival of multiple myeloma (MM) cells, which are transformed plasma cells. MM is an incurable neoplasm char-acterized by accumulation of a monotypic plasma-cell population in bonemarrow, the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulins serum and/or urine, and osteolytic bone lesions ( Hideshima & Anderson, 2002 ). MM is a genetically clonal malignancy that progresses slowly ( Greipp et al., 2005 ). Normal B cells undergo CSR and SHM via the GC reaction to produce high-affinity antibodies. During this process, AID generates double-strand DNA breaks at the IgH locus, which creates transformation-promoting genetic lesions via a high mutation rate ( Gonzalez et al., 2007 ). Although these mutations are repaired immediately, some aberrant translocations can accu-mulate, which may result in the generation of monoclonal gammopathy ofundetermined significance ( Kyle et al., 2007 ); this is an indolent, asymptom- atic condition but has an increased incidence of MM. Chromosomal trans- locations at the immunoglobulin switch region of the IgH locus is 2002 Complexity in the activating mutations in the genes RasandTP53 and inactivating mutations in cyclin-dependent kinase genes leads to the malignant transformation of plasma cells ( Palumbo & Anderson, 2011 ). Pathogenesis may occur upon a secondary genetic abnormality, ie, deletion or translocation, such as an abnormality in the plasma-cell program genes, XBP-1, Blimp-1, and IRF4 ( Morgan, Walker, & Davies, 2012 ). In addition to the intrinsic alteration of genes in MM, the communicationbetween MM and the bone marrow microenvironment that supplies sur-vival signals is also important for MM progression. We previously showed that Blimp-1 is required for the survival of MM cells, and deletion of Blimp-1 results in apoptosis of MM cells ( Lin, Kuo, Ying, Yang, & Lin, 2007 ). Blimp-1 sustains the survival of MM cells by directly suppressing78 Y.-H. Yu and K.-I. Linthe expression of ASK1 (Lin et al., 2012 ). Inducible expression of ASK1 in MM cells causes apoptosis, which is linked to a significant induction in the level of the proapoptotic protein Bim, especially Bim EL, which is encoded by an alternatively spliced form of Bim pre-mRNA ( O'Connor et al., 1998 ). Furthermore, ASK1 is for Blimp-1 knockdown-induced apoptosisand -induced Bim elevation. Notably, Blimp-1 is a tumor-suppressor gene whose mutation is linked with activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lym- lymphoproliferation was frequently micewith deletion of Prdm1 ( Mandelbaum et al., 2010 ). Using an animal model with constitutive activation of the canonical NF- B pathway and deletion of Prdm1 in B cells, Calado et al. (2010) showed that animals developed a lymphoma resembling human ABC-DLBCL. There-fore, in the B-cell lineage, Blimp-1 is not only required for the generation and maintenance of normal plasma cells but also involved in sustaining the survival of malignant plasma cells and suppressing the generation of asubtype of DLBCL. 4.2 Roles of Blimp-1 in Other Cell Lineages In addition to the B-cell lineage, Blimp-1 has been implicated in otherimmune responses. In CD4 +T helper cells, Blimp-1 plays a regulatory role to prevent T cells to be overactive because conditional deletion of Prdm1 in mouse T cells causes the accumulation of effector memory T cells and results in the development of autoimmune colitis ( Kallies et al., 2006; Martins et al., 2006 ). Blimp-1 also optimizes the of Th2 cells and limits Tfh-cell differentiation ( Cimmino et al., 2008; Johnston et al., 2009 ).Prdm1 deletion in T cells reduces the differentiation and cytotoxic activity of CD8+effector cells in vivo, thereby lympho- cytic Belz, & Nutt, 2009; Rutishauser et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2009 ). In DCs, Blimp-1 is important for restraining the production of cytokines and homeostasis of DC subsets (Chan et al., 2009 ). Mice lacking Blimp-1 in all hematopoietic lineages, gen- erated by crossing Prdm1f/fmice with Tie2-cre transgenic mice revealed new roles of Blimp-1 in DC lineage ( Chan et al., 2009 ). Blimp-1 negatively regulates the homeostatic development of a select subset of cDCs, CD8/C0 cDCs, and is required for DC maturation. Cytokine- or Toll-like receptorligand-induced maturation of DCs is impaired both in vivo and in vitrowhen Blimp-1 is absent ( Chan et al., 2009 ). Moreover, DC-specific deletion79 Generation of Antibody-Secreting Plasma CellsofPrdm1 resulted in altered DC function and developed systemic lupus erythematosus ( Kim, Zou, Goldstein, Reizis, & Diamond, 2011 ). In addition, the been reported to be either directly or indirectly suppressed by Blimp-1 ( Chan et al., 2009; Smith ). Blimp-1 is also expressed in keratinocytes, and Prdm1 deletion in mouse adult keratinocytes results in macrophage/granulocyte-dominant skin inflammation ( Chiang et al., 2013 ). Adult mice lacking Blimp-1 in keratinocytes manifest chronic skin inflammation, active innate and adaptive immune responses in lym- phoid organs, and enhanced granulopoiesis in bone marrow. Neutrophiliaand skin inflammation in conditional knockout mice at least partly resultsfrom an elevated level of G-CSF, which is indirectly regulated by Blimp-1. In agreement with these results, Blimp-1 level is reduced in skin lesions of some cases of human eczema and chronic skin inflammation ( Chiang et al., 2013 ). 4.3 Mechanisms of Transcriptional Repression by Blimp-1 Human and mouse Blimp-1 contain 789 and 856 amino acid residues,respectively, that comprise several functional domains: the acidic region,the PR domain (named from PRDI-BF1 and the Rb-binding protein RIZ1, the first two proteins in which the PR domain was characterized), the proline-rich domain, and a Kru \u00a8ppel-type zinc-finger domain ( Tunyaplin et al., 2000 ). Mouse Blimp-1 contains an additional 31 residues at the N-terminus despite the high sequence identity between human and mouse Blimp-1 ( Huang, 1994 ).PRDM1 encodes two major isoforms, namely Blimp-1 and Blimp-1 , expression of which is from alter- native promoters ( Gyory, Fejer, Ghosh, Seto, & Wright, 2003 ). Blimp-1 is transcribed from the promoter immediately upstream of exon 1, which pro- duces the full-length protein. Blimp-1 is transcribed from a distinct promoter and exon using a promoter that is located upstream of exon 4.Compared with Blimp-1 , Blimp-1 lacks the first 101 residues and has only part of the PR domain. Although Blimp-1 retains DNA-binding activity, nuclear localization, and the ability to associate with histone deacetylases (HDACs), it cannot repress target genes ( Gyory 2003 ). Blimp-1 is 2007 Zhao et displays80 and K.-I. Lina much lower ratio of Blimp-1 /Blimp-1 than normal plasma cells; this may be a consequence of aberrant hypermethylation-mediated silencing of the Blimp-1 promoter and hypomethylation of the Blimp-1 promoter (Zhang et al., 2015 ). However, the physiological functions, if any, of Blimp- 1have not been formally demonstrated. The functions of two acidic regions located at N-terminus and C-terminus of Blimp-1 have not been fully characterized. The PR domain resembles the SET domain, which mediates histone methyltransferase activ-ity ( Dillon, Zhang, Trievel, & Cheng, 2005 ). However, Blimp-1 has not been shown to have histone methyltransferase activity. The proline-rich domain interacts with several proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, including HDAC1/2, Groucho family proteins, and lysine-specificdemethylase-1 ( Ren, Chee, Kim, Maniatis, 1999; Yu, Angelin-Duclos, Greenwood, Liao, & Calame, 2000 ). Accordingly, deletion of this proline-rich region substantively affects the function of Blimp-1 in controlling plasma-cell differentiation as well as in promotingapoptosis upon its enforced expression in immature B cells ( Messika et al., 1998; Su et al., 2009 ). By interacting with the domain cell line U2OS (Gyory, Wu, Fejer, & ). The interaction between histone modifiers and Blimp-1 results in a change in status of histone modificationsand gene expression. For example, recruitment of HDAC1/2 to endoge- nous Blimp-1 target sites enables the removal of acetyl groups from histones and reduces gene expression ( Yu et al., 2000 ). G9a methylates H3 at lysine 9, which epigenetic regulation of transcription.Moreover, lysine-specific or dimethyl groups on H3 lysine 4, which is generally considered an active histone mark. In mouse primordial germ cells, PRMT5, a histone arginine-specific meth-yltransferase that transfers a methyl group to arginine 3 of histone H2Aand/or H4 tails, is functionally associated with Blimp-1 ( Ancelin et al., 2006 ), although the precise region of Blimp-1 that directly interacts with PRMT5 has not been determined. Blimp1-Prmt5 colocalization is associ-ated with high levels of H2A/H4 arginine 4 methylation in primordial germcells in mouse embryos at day 8.5 ( Ancelin et al., 2006 ). Notably, interaction between Blimp-1 and those histone modifiers appears to be cell type-specific because an interaction between Blimp-1 and Prdm5 has not been detected in plasma cells ( Su et al., 2009 ). There are five consecutive zinc-finger domains in the C-terminal half of Blimp-1, and zinc fingers 1 and 2 confer81 Generation of Antibody-Secreting Plasma CellsDNA-binding activity ( Kelley et al., 1998 ). Two independent studies have elucidated the DNA-binding consensus motifs of Blimp-1, which are Doody et al., 2010 ). Several studies have identified the target genes regulated by Blimp-1 in B cells and other immune cells ( Fig. 2 ). Blimp-1 directly represses c-Myc to halt cell cycling, a characteristic of terminally differentiated plasma cells ( Lin, Wong, & Calame, 1997 ). However, during Blimp-1-mediated plasma-cell differentiation, c-Myc repression is necessary but not sufficient ( Lin, Lin, & Calame, 2000 ).CIITA , which is a master regulator of MHC class II expres- sion, is directly suppressed by Blimp-1, thereby inhibiting the antigen- presenting function of plasma cells ( Piskurich et al., 2000 ). Blimp-1 directly suppresses Pax5 , thereby allowing the transition from mature B cells to plasma cells ( Lin et al., 2002 ). Blimp-1-dependent suppression of Pax5 is suf- the expression of CD19 orJ chain , respectively, in plasma cells. Moreover, several other key transcription factors involved in GC functions are directly suppressed by Blimp-1. For instance, Blimp-1 directly binds to the mouse Bcl-6 genomic locus located 5 kb upstream of the first exon, such that Bcl-6 and Blimp-1 work as antag- onistic transcription factors to control the fate decision during the transition Blimp-1 IL-21 signalingmiR-21 Cell cyclec-Myc 2 a key regulator differentiation. Within B-cell lineage, the transcriptional repressor, Blimp-1, suppresses target genes with functions in cell cycle, antigen presentation, B-cell identity, and apoptosis to direct plasma-cell differentiation. Blimp-1 is upregulated by Fos, STAT3, and by PAX5, BCL-6, BACH2, miR-9, and cells.82 Y.-H. Yu and K.-I. Linfrom GC B cells ( Cimmino et al., 2008 ). Blimp-1 can directly suppress p53by binding to its promoter ( Yan et al., 2007 ), suggesting a possible mechanism underlying the effects of Blimp-1 on the maintenanceof long-lived plasma cells, ie, the mechanism may be partly attributable torepression of p53, which induces apoptosis. Two DNA microarray studies were carried out to globally identify the genes regulated by Blimp-1 ( Sciammas & Davis, 2004; Shaffer et al., 2002 ). Inducible expression of Blimp-1 in human mature B-cell lines was found tosuppress a panel of genes that are important for BCR signaling, antigen pre-sentation, GC reaction, and cell proliferation, whereas only a small number of genes were upregulated upon Blimp-1 expression. SPI-B and ID3 were identified as Blimp-1 direct target genes ( Shaffer et al., 2002 ). Another independent study in which Blimp-1 was expressed in murine B-celllines showed that Blimp-1 regulates genes involved in affinity maturation, homeostasis, migration, differentiation, and antibody secretion ( Sciammas & Davis, 2004 ). It appears that the expression of Blimp-1-dependent genes and their functions rely on the activity of specific domains of Blimp-1.For example, the PR domain of Blimp-1 is required for Ig secretion ( Sciammas & Davis, 2004 ). Blimp-1 also regulates expression of micro- RNAs in the B-cell lineage. Blimp-1 binds to the miR-21 promoter and directly suppresses transcription of the miR-21 Barnes, Stephenson, Cocco, Tooze, & Doody, 2012 ), establishing a feedback regulatory loop that counters the effects of STAT3 on activating miR-21 induced by IL-21 signaling. In the T-cell lineage, Blimp-1 negatively regulates the proliferation and survival of virus-specific CD8+T cells via direct suppression of Il2ra and Cd27 (Shin et al., 2013 ). Blimp-1 also participates in limiting T-cell prolif- eration during an immune response by directly repressing Il-2andFos (Martins et al., 2008 ). the produc- tion of or transcription that are important fordetermining Th1 vs Th2 polarization. Blimp-1 binds directly to a distal regulatory region in Ifn-and to multiple sites in Tbx21 (encoding T-bet) andBcl-6 ( Cimmino et al., 2008 ). By suppressing genes critical for Th1 differentiation, Blimp-1 promotes the generation of Th2 cells. AlthoughBlimp-1 mainly acts as a transcriptional repressor, it also can activate geneexpression. For example, the IL-4/STAT4-dependent pathway induces Blimp-1 expression in Th1 cells, which in turn acts synergistically with c-Maf to induce IL-10 expression by directly binding to a region /C249k b upstream of the transcription start site of the Il-10 locus ( Neumann et al., 2014 ).83 Generation of Antibody-Secreting Plasma Cells4.4 Regulation of Blimp-1 Expression Expression of PRDM1 is tightly regulated during plasma-cell differentiation. Several regulatory mechanisms, including transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational, have been reported to regulate Blimp-1 expression.Aside from the aforementioned numerous transcription factors, includingBCL-6, PAX5, and BACH2, that directly repress Prdm1 transcription in mature B cells ( Mora-Lopez et al., 2007; Ochiai et al., 2006 ;Tunyaplin et al., 2004 ), the expression of Blimp-1 can also be regulated by other tran- scription factors that act downstream of Toll-like induce Blimp-1 expression ( Yasuda et al., 2011 ). Consistent with this, conditional deletion of ERK1 and ERK2 in GC B cells leads to impaired plasma-cell production following immuniza-tion with TD antigen. AP-1 binds directly to the murine Prdm1 promoter, and CD40L/IL-4-stimulated B cells isolated from transgenic mice over- expressing c-Fos show augmented Blimp-1 expression as well as enhanced plasma-cell differentiation ( Ohkubo et al., 2005 ). However, Fos/AP-1 is not essential for Prdm1 activation ( Ohkubo et al., 2005 ). Activated STAT3 ing downstream of cytokine signaling pathways also induces Blimp-1 expression. Activation of STAT3 by IL-21 as well as ectopic expression of STAT3 in human peripheral B cells induces Blimp-1 expression ( Diehl et al., 2008 ). Although CD40L alone does not significantly affect Blimp-1 expression, IL-21 and CD40L have synergistic effects on Blimp-1 induction (Ding, Bi, Chen, Yu, & Ye, 2013 ). Activated STAT3 induced by CD40L treatment in human B cells outcompetes the binding of BCL-6 to PRDM1 intron 3 and thereby induces Blimp-1 expression. The importance ofSTAT3 in plasma-cell differentiation is further demonstrated by B-cell-specific Stat3 knockout mice, in which normal B-cell development, normal IgM responses, and normal GC reactions are observed, but the mice dis- played profound defects in IgG response following immunization withTD antigen ( Fornek et al., 2006 ). STAT3 also interact IRF4, which mediates the induction of Blimp-1 in IL-21-stimulated B cells (Kwon et al., 2009 ). Several binding sites for NF- B are found in Prdm1 (Calame, 2008; Morgan et al., 2009 ). Particularly, NF- B sites have been identified upstream of the exon 1A promoter of Prdm1 , which regulates the induction of Blimp-1 in LPS-treated B cells ( Morgan et al., 2009 ). Mutant B cells lacking Prdm1 exon 1A, encompassing NF- B sites, show severe defects in the induction of Blimp-1 in response to LPS treatmentand cannot generate antibody-producing plasma cells. In agreement with84 Y.-H. Yu and K.-I. Linthis finding, stimulated B cells isolated from mice lacking RelA , a subunit of NF-B, in the B-cell lineage have a severely reduced number of plasmablasts as well as dramatically impaired induction of Blimp-1 ( Heise et al., 2014 ). Blimp-1 expression is also regulated at the posttranscriptional level. The microRNA miR-125b binds to the mRNAs Ectopic expression of miR-125b in LPS-stimulated B cells results in reduced pro- duction of IgM and impaired generation of CD138+plasma cells (Gururajan et al., 2010 ). In Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin lymphoma, high levels of miR-9 and let-7 are linked with the low expres- sion Blimp-1, whereas overexpression or inhibition of miR-9 and let-7 expression results in reduced or increased Blimp-1 expression, respectively( Nie et al., 2008 ). microRNA-mediated Blimp-1 expression has also been implicated in other cell lineages. For instance, Blimp-1 and let-7c recipro- cally regulate each other, which confers activation of DCs; let-7c targets the 30-untranslated region of sup- The expres- sion of miR-23a and miR-125b is negatively with Blimp-1 expression in human DCs and plasmacytoid DCs derived from 2013 ). miR-23a downregulates for and differentiationof CD8 +cytotoxic T cells ( Lin et al., 2014 ). Blimp-1 contains a relatively large proportion of serine (9.2% in human), threonine (5.5% in human), and tyrosine (4.1% in human) residues, and this aspect enables Blimp-1 to be potentially regulated at the posttranslationallevel, eg, by phosphorylation. However, the regulation of Blimp-1 expres-sion at the posttranslational level has been only modestly studied. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification of Blimp-1 has been two studies ( Shimshon et al., 2011; Ying et al., 2012 ). Blimp-1 can be covalently modified by SUMO-1 but not SUMO-2 or SUMO-3.SUMOylation 816 in human Blimp-1 is SUMOylation site. More importantly, disruption of Blimp-1 SUMOylation results in defective plasma-cell differ-entiation, impaired transcriptional repression of target genes, and reducedinteraction with HDAC2 ( Ying et al., 2012 ). The Blimp-1 sequence con- tains a high percentage of PEST (proline/glutamic acid/serine/threonine) residues, and the PEST motif is associated with a short protein half-life; specifically, PEST-containing proteins are targeted for degradation byproteasomes. Indeed, human Blimp-1 has been shown to interact with85 Generation of Antibody-Secreting Plasma CellsFBXO11 ( Horn et al., 2014 ), an F-box protein that functions as the substrate-recognition component of Skp1-Cullin-F-box-E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and is involved in the regulation of protein ubiquitinationand degradation. The interaction of Blimp-1 with FBXO11 triggersBlimp-1 degradation; conversely, knockdown of FBXO11 by a short hair-pin RNA results in the stabilization of Blimp-1 in MM cell lines. In DCs, Hdr1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Blimp-1 and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation ( Yang et al., 2014 ). However, the regulatory machinery that controls Blimp-1 turnover in B cells awaits full characterization. 5. PERSPECTIVES In this review, we have discussed recent findings concerning memory B-cell fate decision, plasma-cell differentiation and maintenance, and thefunctional role of the key regulator, Blimp-1, in these events. However,many intricate and unsolved issues remain, including the detailed molecular mechanisms that control how memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells are selected, how long-lived plasma cells homing to the appropriate niche, andhow transcriptional or signal transduction networks are integrated to supportlongevity. Hence, new techniques are required to facilitate analysis at the single-cell level. Such new approaches may potentiate the manipulation of memory B cells and plasma cells for boosting humoral responses invaccination. The current strategies for designing vaccines focus on the acquisition of high-affinity memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells. Upon reinfection, long-lived plasma cells produce neutralizing antibodies against the original pathogen; however, these antibodies are poorly reactive with variant path-ogens, whereas some memory B cells with broadly neutralizing antibodyspecificities may undergo a reevolution upon entering GCs and undergo additional rounds of GC reactions upon reinfection with variant pathogens, which may result in the production of high-affinity variant pathogen-specific antibodies ( Purtha, Tedder, Johnson, Bhattacharya, & Diamond, 2011 ). It is thus intriguing to further study the mechanisms that enhance the selection of broader pools of memory B cells having the ability to recognize not only specific pathogens but also variant pathogens. In the context of Blimp-1 biology, further understanding of the molec- ular mechanisms, such as the role of ABF-1 in memory B cells combined with modulating the Blimp-1/ABF-1 regulatory pathway, that determine memory B-cell vs plasma-cell fate will provide valuable insight for86 Y.-H. Yu and K.-I. Lindeveloping new vaccines for infectious diseases and aid in boosting immune responses following vaccination. Regulation of Blimp-1 expression is still largely unexplored. Further studies on the posttranslational modificationof Blimp-1 and its relevance in the expression and function of Blimp-1 mayprovide an additional layer of approaches to understand the pathogenesisof plasma-cell- or GC B-cell-relevant disorders. Additionally, proteomic- based studies of Blimp-1-interacting partners in a subset of GC B cells as well as short-lived and long-lived plasma cells may provide further insight intohow Blimp-1 works during the various stages of differentiation, whichmay provide new directions for the design of agents to control Blimp-1 expression for managing certain plasma cell-relevant diseases.

ISSN 0065-2776 All rights reserved. http:/ /dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.ai.2016.02.002101functional diversity. Here, we briefly revisit the past and present understanding of T cell heterogeneity, and the technologies that facilitate this knowledge. In addition, we review the current progress of mass cytometry and high-dimensional cytometric anal-ysis, including the methodology, panel design, experimental procedure, and choice ofcomputational algorithms with a special focus on their utility in exploration of humanT cell immunology. 1. INTRODUCTION Continuous and recently rapid improvements in single-cell analysis methods are allowing for exploration of cellular diversity at unprecedented depth and throughput. The development of fluorescence-based flow cytometry ( Lanier et al., 1983 ) and the ability to probe single-cell protein expression with high throughput has been instrumental laying the founda-tions of modern cellular immunology ( Bendall, Nolan, Roederer, & Chattopadhyay, 2012 ). the use of flow cytometry is ubiq- uitous and is often employed as a foremost tool to identify cells of interestprior to other downstream analysis such as gene-expression profiling orother functional experiments performed in vitro or in vivo. The application of flow cytometry has been the benchmark not only for fundamental immu- nology but also translational biomedical research, from primary discovery toclinical diagnosis and prognosis. It offers the characterization of cell fre-quency, cell subsets, protein expression, and functional or high-dimensional polychromatic flow cytometry ( al., 2009; Bendall et 2011; Newell, Sigal, Bendall, Nolan, & Davis, 2012 ) allow for identification of numerous cellular subpop- ulations and the ability to probe relationships between expression levels of large numbers of proteins simultaneously. In this regard, recent efforts in technology development continue their push to allow better understandingof single-cell heterogeneity in terms of proteomics, by time-of-flight) ( Bandura et al., 2009 ) is a recently developed form of flow cytometry based on atomic mass spectrometry ( Ornatsky et Tanner, Baranov, George, 2013 ) that uses metal isotope tagged antibodies to probe cells for expression of protein antigens that are quantified on individual cells using TOF mass spectrometry. Importantly, these metal isotopes are purified102 Y. Cheng and E.W. Newellmainly from lanthanide family (with atomic numbers from 57 to 71 on peri- odic table) that are rarely seen in biological system ( Bandura et al., 2009 ), making them useful as exogenous tags to probe mammalian cells. Becauseof the limited fluorophores and the difficulties associated with spectral com-pensation in flow cytometry experiments, most laboratories measure cellswith no more than 10 -12 parameters at a time. However, with the devel- opment of novel dyes and improved flow cytometry instrumentation, this number will continue to rise ( Bendall et al., 2012 ). In contrast, the mass win- dow (analog to fluorescent channel) of mass cytometry is >100 atomic mass channels with limited-to-no crosstalk. The measurements depend on the availability and quality of purified metal isotopes and the availability of appropriate chemistries for labeling probes ( Tanner et al., 2013 ). Current practice of mass cytometry allows simultaneously measuring more than40 different antibody parameters, permitting in-depth analysis of multiple aspects of cellular diversity of immune cells, exemplified particularly in T cell biology. T cells are well known as key coordinators of human immune system. The roles of various types of T cells are linked to infectious disease, autoim- mune disease, and cancer. Describing the phenotypes of these cells in health and disease is has been, and continues to be, a major task for biomedicalimmunologists. This task is particularly challenging because of the widerange of cellular factors that need to be considered simultaneously, includingcell differentiation ( Arens & Schoenberger, 2010; 2006; Newell et al., 2012), cell migration/tissue homing ( Griffith, Sokol, & Luster, 2014 ), and antigen recognition ( Newell & Davis, 2014 ). Study of these cellular markers is important to perceive the change of immune homeostasis upon disease perturbation. Our understanding of adaptive immunity and categorization of types of T cell responses has been largely based on the knowledge of cellular proteins expressed by these different types of cells, such as T cell receptors (TCRs), surface markers expression, intracellular cytokines production, or intra-nuclear transcription factors level. In particular, these definitions of cells gaverise the operational CD4 +T like T H1, T H2, T H17 (Harrington et al., 2005 ), regulatory T cells (Treg) ( Josefowicz, Lu, & Rudensky, 2012 ), follicular T cells (TFH)(Johnston et al., 2009 ), and T H9(Xiao et al., 2012 ). Conversely, lack of clear major transcription factors or dominant cytokines for segregating103 Deep Profiling Human T Cell Heterogeneitysubsets, human CD8+T cells have been mostly categorized using a lasting model based on their differentiation markers (eg, CD45RA and CCR7) (Sallusto, For decades, immu- nologists have used these markers to identify na \u00a8ve, effector memory (T EM), central memory (T CM), and terminally differentiated (T EMRA ) T cells (Sallusto, Geginat, & Lanzavecchia, 2004 the addition CD127 and KLRG-1 ( Kaech et al., 2003 ). The latter was proposed by Kaech et al., which endorsed the different nomenclature as memory-precursor effector cell (MPEC) and short-lived effector 2012 ). Notably, the memory/effector subsets between these two approaches are not mutually exclusive, making it difficult to systemically identify different populations when using these four (or more, such as addingCD62L and CD28) ( Lugli, 2013 ) markers altogether. In addition, although both systems have been widely adapted by the immunology community and proved to be informative in understanding various types of immuneresponses, the relationships between these two types of classifications havenot been completely elucidated. As of yet, this discordance of subset termi- nology and their usages can make it difficult to reconcile various seemingly overlapping studies ( 2015 ). With the advent of mass cytometry, many more markers can be inte- grated to systemically characterize human T cell subsets, combining markers indicative of their states of cell differentiation, memory/exhaustion, func- tional capacity, transcription factor expression profiles, trafficking receptorexpression profile, and antigen specificity. With this type of information,it is clear that visualizing cells on two-dimension plots is insufficient and instead, a higher-dimensional perspective is needed. These methods promise a greater ability to visualize and comprehend the seemingly endless diversityof T and other lymphocyte subsets. In this review, we discuss the advance-ment of mass cytometry, from the technical hardware to software, and focus on their application in study of human T cell biology. 2. T CELL HETEROGENEITY: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST After their discovery, for five decades the scientific community had seen lymphocytes as a homogeneous cell population ( Murphy, 1914a ). In 1967 Jacques Miller (JFAP Miller) proposed that lymphocytes were com- posed of T and B cells ( Masopust, Vezys, Wherry, & Ahmed, 2007;104 Y. Cheng and E.W. NewellMiller & Mitchell, 1967 ), and received much criticism ( Miller, 1999 ). A decade later, seminal experiments demonstrated murine Ly-1+and Ly-2,3+lymphocytes were functionally different ( Jandinski, Cantor, Tadakuma, Pierce, 1976 CD8+T cells ( Reinherz & Schlossman, 1980 ). Unequivocal showed that the depletion CD8 /abrogated cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Cantor & Boyse, 1975; Shiku et al., 1975 ). Thus, these studies established the concept of divergent lineages of CD4+and CD8+T cell. Around the same time, several observations had implied the existence of distinct subsetsof helper T cells ( Imperiale, ). Later, Mosmann et al. provided the first solid proof of the existence of T H1 and T H2 cells at the clonal level and showed their functionally distinct roles ( Mosmann, Cherwinski, Bond, Giedlin, & Coffman, 1986 were indispensible in establishing a founda- tion of evidence supporting the notion of T cell heterogeneity. The rapid development of the usage of monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry has dramatically changed our ability to look at immune cells. After its development, the widespread use of flow cytometry to investigate marker expression of T cells quickly became a standardized and required toolin immunological research. Subsequent identification of various master tran-scription factors and their signature cytokines has added Treg, T H17, T FH, and others to the list of CD4+helper subsets in the past decade al., 2012; Weaver, Hatton, Mangan, & Harrington, 2007). Along with other techniques, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based experiments have enabled the exploration of the heterogene-ity of T cells and their distinct functional roles, such as the reciprocal effect of Treg and T H17 in autoimmune disease ( Mucida et al., 2007 ). The use of antibodies to specifically probe markers of T cells and T cells subsets hastherefore opened a new era of T cell heterogeneity. The dissimilar lineage properties of CD4 +and CD8+T cells have earned their reputation as helper T lymphocytes and cytotoxicity T lymphocytes (CTL) during immune response, respectively. Perhaps for this reason, mostimmunologists view heterogeneity of these two lineages from a differentperspective. In general, CD4 +T cells are divided into various functional subsets while CD8+T cells are parted as a range of differentiation. As more CD4+T cells subsets are verified, the different \"helper\" programs of CD4+ T cells seem to be delivered by various helper subsets, especially in different context of diseases. Distinctively, functional population of CD8+T cells has105 Deep Profiling Human T Cell Heterogeneitybeen often depicted as Tc1 (IFN- +, TNF- +, and IL-2+)(Woodland & Dutton, 2003 ) without other well defined subsets. This is possibly because most studies were only focused on a few functional markers attributed to thelimited fluorescent channels in flow cytometry, or the single cytokine secre-tion assay such as ELISPOT. their multiple abilityto produce IFN- +, TNF- +, and/or IL-2+), the characterization of CD8+ T cells has mainly relied on markers associated with cell differentiation as mentioned earlier. Specifically, where the loss of CD45RA suggests theactivation state of cells, and the expression of CCR7 indicates the lymphoidresidency/trafficking ( Sallusto et al., 2004 ). Based on these expression profiles, Lanzavecchia and colleagues impressively discerned CD8+T cells into principle populations with distinct differentiation and effector activitiesbased on these two markers. Furthermore, based on the nonredundancy ofIL-7 signaling in T cell memory development, Kaech et al. used CD127 (IL- 7R) and KLRG-1 to distinguish long-term memory cells and short-lived effector cells ( Kaech & Cui, 2012 ). Others have explored the usages of these two approaches ( Plumlee, Sheridan, Cicek, & Lefrancois, 2013 ), or expanded them by adding several other surface markers ( Gattinoni et al., 2011). Unquestionably though, given the limited channels in flow cyto- metry experiment, the two-marker systems of subset segregations has beenremarkably useful in study of human T cell. By applying one of the two-marker systems, immunologists are in favor of a clear four subsets separationthat could be simply visualized and quantified using a single two- dimensional dotplot. Although the effectiveness of these approaches for analyzing CD8 + T cells responses are clear, they may also underestimate the functional het-erogeneity of human T cells. Compelling evidences in recent years have proved that CD8 +T cells could possess diverse functional subsets in regu- lating immune response instead of the simple ability. Tang, Wang, ) cells, Qa-1 et al., 2013 ). Studies also described other detailed differentiation subsets like stem-like memory T cell (T SCM) (Gattinoni et al., 2011 ), transitional T EM(Mahnke et al., 2013 ) or tissue- resident memory T cell (T RM)(Mueller, Gebhardt, Carbone, & Heath,106 Y. Cheng and E.W. Newell2013). Second, because it takes additional markers to identify these cells of interest, only few differentiation and functional markers can be assessed simultaneously in flow cytometry. The critical relationship between certaincategories of cellular property has been widely unclear, such as differentia-tion vs function or differentiation vs trafficking ( Baaten, Cooper, Swain, & Bradley, 2013; Schmitt & Ueno, 2015 ). From the differences of T cell differentiation, function, transcriptional signaling, tissue homing, and even antigen specificity, there is an unmet needto apply a more robust tool to more comprehensively assess the massivedegree of T cell heterogeneity, such as mass cytometry and high- dimensional cytometric analysis. 3. MASS CYTOMETRY: EXPERIMENTAL WORKFLOW AND DATA PROCESSING Mass cytometry is composed of cell introduction system, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) ( Houk et al., 1980 ), TOF and computer that collects and processes data ( Bandura et al., 2009 ). The meth- odology of mass cytometry has been described in detail elsewhere ( Bendall et al., 2012; Bjornson, Nolan, & Fantl, 2013; Tanner et al., 2013 ). Briefly, the cells labeled with metal-tag antibodies are pushed into machine by argon gas and nebulizer to form single-cell aerosol. Together with the inductivecoil and flowing argon stream, they generate high-temperature (7000 Kat surface and 5500 K in the core) plasma that construct the central compo- nent, ICP. Cell is introduced into this toroidal plasma along the axis in a spray chamber heated to 200 \u00b0C. The plasma further vaporizes the cells, breaking all molecular bonds to ionize each atom that have ionization capac-ity. Subsequently, this ionized cloud moves into the quadrupole that allows only heavier ions ( >100 Da) to filter through, leaving the biological abun- dant atoms from cell (eg, carbon, sulfur, hydrogen, and nitrogen) behind.Filtered ions then enter into TOF and detector that configures the dualcount of each metal signal, and finally processed by computer to produce data file. 3.1 Antibody Conjugation Many laboratories use either commercial metal-conjugated antibody or crosslink the metal and antibody in-house using conjugation kits. The for- mer offers commercial quality of metal-tag antibody, where the latter pro- vides more flexibility on panel design. Current protocol of metal-antibody107 Deep Profiling Human T Cell Heterogeneityconjugation is to use liner (X8) or dendrimer (DN3) polymer to bridge the metal and antibody ( Bandura et al., 2009; Majonis et al., 2010 ). Each anti- body could be attached by 4 -5 metal-chelated polymers, of which has monomers to (+3) elements (lanthanide family). Notably, such covalentlybinding is comparably as strong as streptavidin -biotin in terms of the dissociation constant ( K D)(Bjornson et al., 2013; Tanner et 2013 ). Typ- ically, purified carrier protein-free (ie, BSA or gelatin) antibodies are used formetal conjugation as these carrier proteins can also react with polymer-crosslinkers. 3.2 Cell Staining The experimental procedure of mass cytometry is similar to the standard fluorescence flow cytometry staining workflow with some altered steps to fit better the system of mass cytometry ( Fig. 1 ). After cell isolation, it is rec- ommended to perform further purification of target cells, such as T cell(CD4 or CD8) enrichment or dead cell removal. Since the cell throughput is much lower than flow cytometry, this step can greatly reduce the acqui- sition time of CyTOF, especially when working on large numbers of sam-ples (ie, >20 samples and >6 million cells/sample). If cell stimulation is (eg, PMA/ionomycin, anti-CD3/CD28, ), anti-CD107a can be added into the stimulation as reported for flow cytometry cell staining ( Betts et al., 2003 ). In addition, some surface markers downregulate their expres- sion under stimuli, especially chemokine receptors. To better probe T cells,a minimal amount of metal-tag antibodies against trafficking receptors can be included in the stimulation medium to increase performance of these stains ( Wong et al., 2015 ). For instance, we observed a 10% difference in fre- quency of CXCR5 expression on peripheral and tonsilar CD4+T cells with or without prestain protocol (unpublished data) upon PMA/ionomycin stimulation. Importantly, such difference is affected by strong stimulation and can be prevented by this additional step ( Wong et al., 2015 ). This may be something that is unique for mass cytometry staining as metal-tagantibodies have higher stability of antibody conjugates compared tofluorophore-tag antibodies during cell incubation. Prior to any type of staining, a short exposure of cisplatin (Pt-195, Pt-194, or Pt-198) allows platinum (Pt) (or other reactive probe) to cova-lently bind to dead cells ( Bendall et al., 2011; Fienberg, Simonds, Fantl,108 Y.

The experimental pro- cedure for study of T cell using mass cytometry can be separated into multiple steps, including (i) sample preparation, (ii) cell staining, (iii) cell barcoding, (iv) acquisition of CyTOF, (v) data processing (randomization, normalization and cell de-barcoding), and (vi) high-dimensional data analysis. Briefly, cells are isolated from PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) or tissue samples. After the optional enrichment step, cell (Continued )109 Deep Profiling Human T Cell HeterogeneityNolan, & Bodenmiller, 2012; Mei, Leipold, & Maecker, 2015 ). Notably, it is important to apply stringent wash to reduce the background of cisplatin. Like fluorescent antibody, most surface markers (eg, differentiation and traf-ficking receptors) can be sufficiently stained using metal-tag antibodiesunder the condition of 30 min on ice. Some laboratories have used differentprotocol to optimize the staining quality, such as stain pooled cells together after cell barcoding ( Mei, Leipold, Schulz, Chester, & Maecker, 2015 and fix with paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnightat 4\u00b0C. This resilient fixation is to prevent cell burst when resuspend cells in highly pure water upon acquisition. Permeabilization of cell could be achieved by using saponin-based commercial kit on the next day for intra- cellular cell transcription factor, we recommend toperform the intranuclear permeabilization soon after the surface staining ahead of overnight fixation. It is critical to carefully titrate the intranuclear antibodies for this purpose. Optionally, utilization of secondary antibody(eg, anti-FoxP3-PE followed by anti-PE-metal) to amplify the signal canalso resolve better separation of positive and negative populations. In general and especially for studies intracellular signaling, the lack of cellular autofluorescence gives mass cytometry an additional advantage over fluores-cence flow cytometry ( Bendall et al., 2012 ). 3.3 Cell Barcoding and DNA Staining Cell barcoding is highly beneficial for the efficient acquisition of good qual-ity mass cytometry data. It provides better efficiency during acquisition byreducing time needed to wash instrumentation between samples, eliminat-ing variations between samples, maintaining consistent quality of signal. Also, because mass cytometry does not have forward and side scatter, the light-based measurements in flow cytometry to exclude unwanted cell Fig. 1\u2014Cont'd suspension is stained with Cisplatin for distinguish dead cells. Principally, cells were probed with surface, intracellular, or intranuclear markers after tetramer staining (if applicable). Cells can be further barcoded by Mass-tag cell barcoding (aftercell fixation), or CD45-Pd cell barcoding (before cell fixation) system. Fixed cells are sta- ined with iridium or rhodium DNA-interchelator and resuspended in deionized water for subsequent acquisition on CyTOF. Collected data are converted into FCS file and metalsignals are normalized. De-barcoded samples are loaded onto a bioinformative platform(usually in a MATLAB or R environment, or online server such as Cytobank.org) of choice for high-dimensional cytometric analysis.110 Y. Cheng and E.W. Newelldoublets and debris ( Zunder, Finck, et al., 2015 ), it is therefore important to implement cell barcoding strategy in any mass cytometry experiment. Cur- rent cell double (or triple) barcoding strategies for T cell study includePalladium-tag cell barcoding ( Finck, et ( 2015; Leipold, & Maecker, 2015 ) or other elements ( Lai, Ong, Li, & Albani, 2015). The former approach Palladium isotopes (Pd-102, Pd-104, Pd-106, Palladium isotopes are ideal for cell barcoding becausethe atomic masses of these isotopes are away from the range of atomic masses used for antibody probes (139 -176). The protocol and rationale have been well illustrated by Zunder et al. Alternatively, Maecker and colleaguesemployed human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC). This could be carried out prior surface antibody staining, which permits pooled live cells from differentsamples to be stained simultaneously. Hence, it reduced the antibody con-sumption and staining variation without the need to sacrifice any lanthanide channels for T cell phenotyping. By using 6-choose-3 or 6-choose-2, it can offer 20 or 15 unique combinations to barcode different samples, respec-tively. If the number of sample exceeds this limit, one can adapt multiplebarcode sets and save as independent files upon cell acquisition. Lastly, cells are probed with DNA intercalator diluted in PFA. All mass cytometry to-date use either rhodium iridium (Ir-191/193) metallo-intercalators for this purpose ( Ornatsky et al., 2008, 2010). Together with the cell barcoding scheme, the DNA indicators have provided practical identification of single-cell event with high level of signal intensity. Several studies have addressed the technical usage of DNA inter- calators in this manner ( Bandura et al., 2009; Ornatsky et al., 2008 ). 3.4 Cell Acquisition After all staining procedures are completed, cells are washed, combined, andresuspended in deionized and purified water (Milli-Q). In mass cytometry, acell introduction rate of less than 500 cells/s is critical to resolve single-cellanalysis and maintain high signal sensitivity. Including ours, many laborato- ries have used 500,000 cells/mL (or less) in each 500 L injection (for PBMC), which is roughly 379 cells/s. However, if experiment requires tis-sue samples, we recommend to perform more aggressive dilution to avoid111 Deep Profiling Human T Cell Heterogeneitypossible clog in the cell introduction system, especially the small capillary loop connected to nebulizer. Vigorous washes with wash buffer and 2% nit- ric acid are necessary before and after the acquisition of tissue samples tomaintain high performance of CyTOF and signal intensity. It is also advisedto separate the use of nebulizer and even the connected loop betweenPBMC and tissue sample. Frequent maintenance including the cleaning of sampler cone and skimmer-reducer is also important to obtain high qual- ity data, especially for large cohort or tissue samples. The readout of cell events for mass cytometry is not as robust as flow cytometry. The current output of CyTOF is only about 30 -35% of the injected cells. Avoiding possible clog in the system during runtime is nec- essary. It could also differ from one-loop or two-loop system on the injec-tion end of the CyTOF2. In our experience, the one-loop system providedwith the CyTOF1 is more efficient (up to 45 -48%) than the two-loop system, which may be associated with the different orientations of loops. Efficient acquisition is especially critical when investigating human antigen-specific T cells ( Newell et al., 2013 ) (discussed later). For instance, the fre- quency of viral-specific T cells in human PBMC is usually less than 0.5% of total CD8+T cells. Starting with high numbers of cells and prevent cell lost during steps are consequently important, such as extremely careful whenaspirating cells, flicking plate, or preventing excessive washes betweenstaining. 3.5 Data Processing and Normalization CyTOF collects detected TOF results and converts the configured signalsinto FCS file after cell acquisition ( Bendall et al., 2012 ). Mass cytometry pro- vides absolute quantification of metal-isotopes tagged on the cells, and cell with no metal-tag detected would be considered zero. This signal of zero canbe randomized into values between /C01 and 0 using a simple R-written script with flowCore package or the built-in software in CyTOF before any fur- ther data processing. In our opinion, this step provides a preferable visual- ization (for cells compressed on one axis in 2D plot) on FCS compatiblesoftware such as FlowJo , although such processing does not affect further high-dimensional data analysis. The acquisition time of CyTOF is long and laborious and last from sev- eral hours to even days depending on the sample size. If enrichment of cell is not desirable for experiment, the commitment of individual or change ofmultiple shifts to run the machine is needed. In addition, the strength of112 Y. Cheng and E.W. Newellsignal intensity varies over time, and between machines. Signals in most channels decline gradually as the acquisition continues. In order to remove this signal variation, Finck et al. developed a normalization procedure ( Finck et al., 2013 ) that involves the addition EQ taining has highnumber of corresponded isotope) into the cell suspension. Collected data can be loaded onto an algorithm in MATLAB to normalize the signals based on the beads. This normalization scheme makes large cohort of sample morefeasible for mass cytometry. Finally, after a series of data processing, samplescan be debarcoded by using bivariate Boolean gates or designated algorithm to identify specific sample for downstream high-dimensional cytometric analysis (discussed later). 4. MASS CYTOMETRY: PANEL DESIGN FOR T CELL ANALYSIS In human studies, PBMCs are the most common sample source. Lim- ited quantities of blood and limited access to other types of tissues make mass cytometry an invaluable solution for study of human T cells. This is partic-ularly important when research projects require the study of longitudinalpatients cohort where obtaining sufficient human samples at multiple time points is difficult. The ability of mass cytometry to acquire large in-depth information in single-cell level is hence a robust method to dissect T cellheterogeneity for limited and valuable human tissue. 4.1 Studies of T Cell Using Mass Cytometry To date, several reports have showed the effectiveness of mass cytometryfor study of T cells ( Table 1 ) using various high-dimensional cytometric analyses (discussed later, and Fig. 2 ). Most publications are focused on the usage of mass cytometry in profiling T cell signaling or phenotype in variouscontexts. Combining mass cytometry and high-dimensional data analysis,several groups have also showed the previous elusive aspects of T cells inhuman viral infection, including CMV ( Brodin et al., 2015; Newell et al., 2012, 2013 ), EBV ( Newell al., 2012, 2013 ), Tibshirani, & Nolan, 2014 ), influenza Newell et al., 2012, 2013 ), and rotavirus ( Newell et al., 2013 ).113 Deep Profiling Human T Cell HeterogeneityTable 1 Studies of T Cells Using Mass Cytometry References Spieces/Tissue Types Cell Types SignificantsAnalysis Algorithm Newell et Immunity, 2012Human, PBMC CD8 Differentiation continuum of human CD8 memory CD8 T cells subsets as an example for developing ACCENSEACCENSE (C57BL/6, and thymusCD4 TCR signaling dynamics (ie, CD3 , ERK, etc.) Hierarchical clustering Krishnaswamy et al.

Clus- tering algorithm SPADE (spanning tree progression of density normalized events), a hierarchical clustering algorithm using MST (minimum spanning tree), and its derived forms including Citrus and FLOW-MAP. PhenoGraph and Scaffold map are the other two types of clustering analysis based on different rationales and algorithms. Dimensionality (Continued )116 Y. Cheng and E.W. Newell4.2 Metal Signal and Panel Design The high sensitivity and specificity of ICP-MS installment and the quad- rupole filter that allows <0.0001% overlap between metal channels is what makes mass cytometry such an attractive approach ( Tanner et al., 2013 ), providing a large number of cellular dimensions without the necessity ofcompensation for crosstalk between measured parameters. However, min- imum crosstalk metal channels does occur. Isotopic contamina- tion and oxidation are the two types of cross talks in mass cytometry( Bendall et al., 2012; Tanner et al., 2013 ). These overlaps are relatively minor in mass cytometry experiment (compared to common fluorescencecross talks), but it should be acknowledged when designing staining panel. Of note, this is more important when working on multiplex tetramer staining where requires high mass resolution without cross talk from otherchannels. Isotopic contamination crosstalk is contributed from the metal impurity as the nature of isotope purification. Most commercial enriched lanthanide isotopes are highly purified, usually less than 1% unless for isotopes of veryrare natural abundance. Typically, this impurity of isotopes could leak intotheir neighbor channels (+1 Da and /C01 Da) especially if using sources of metal that are not readily purified for mass cytometry ( Bendall et al., 2012). Future correction of metal purification should overcome this type of crosstalk. Secondly, every metal isotope exhibits certain level of oxidationin argon plasma that causes oxidation crosstalk. During sample introduction, higher rates of \"make-up gas\" (argon) injection allows for better cell throughput and signal intensity during acquisition. However, there is a tra-deoff in that higher gas-flow also leads to higher metal oxidation due to theincomplete ionization in plasma. The oxide ions (+16 Da) from their sourcechannels are dictated by the strength of ion-oxide bond and temperature of Fig. 2\u2014Cont'd reduction algorithm PCA (principal component analysis) reduces dimen- sionality in a linear manner. Alternatively, nonlinear dimensionality reduction DensVM with the clus- tering ability using of One-SENSE soli-expression by nonlinear stochastic embedding) are condensed from t-SNE along with the heatplots of markers expression. t-SNE can also be combined with PhenoGraph to better identify cell clusters. Other nonlinear dimensionality reductionalgorithms used for cell phenotypic progression or trajectory analysis are ISOMAP (isomet-ric feature mapping), Wanderlust, and a recent proposed Diffusion map that simulates cell differentiation with branched continuums.117 Deep Profiling Human T Cell Heterogeneityplasma. The proper warm-up and tuning procedure of CyTOF, which includes the routinely monitoring of current, make-up gas, and oxide ratio (<3%), is important to minimize this issue. Mass window of CyTOF ranges from Y-89 to Bi-209 with lower mass channels at the two ends, while the upper mass signal starts from Eu-153,reach a typical peak signal at Tb-159 and ramp down a little around Yb-170 ( Tricot et al., 2015 ). However, this variation of metal signal inten- sity is within a 2 -3-fold change across the spectrum ( Bendall et al., 2012 ), which is far more consistent than the 10 -50-fold change of fluorescent intensity in flow cytometry. There are many aspects to consider when optimizing a 40-plus panel to meet the experiment purpose, especially for T cell analysis. Based onour experience, we summarize several principles that could be helpfulfor T cell study using mass cytometry, and prioritize the choice of metal channel based on the different characters of markers and experiment purposes.1. Tetramer first: If using tetramer to probe antigen-specific T cell (dis-cussed later), build the panel around it. Leave the best metal channels for tetramer, and then put other cellular markers in rest of the channels accordingly. This is essentially important in investigating rare humanantigen-specific T cells using highly multiplex combinatorial tetramerstrategy. 2.Rare but important markers: Use Tb-159 or channels around it for the important but less abundant markers. In general, channels of Gd-157 to Er-167 are sufficient for this purpose ( Tricot et al., 2015 ). It should also take into account that some markers could have different expressionlevel on different type of T cells and tissues. For instance, PD-1 expres- sion is weaker on human peripheral CD8 +T cell without TCR stimulation. 3.Moderate markers or intranuclear molecules: Markers that usually have\"smear\" expression or intranuclear proteins should be included in the third priority. Use rest of the upper mass channels after tetramer and rare markers. 4.Intracellular cytokines: Most of the cytokines have robust and clearexpression after stimulation, which can be strongly detected in lowermass channels ranging from Pr-141 to Nd-150. However, the concen- tration of metal-tag antibody should be carefully titrated to prevent iso- topic contamination crosstalk, and avoid assigning a weak marker on the+1 channel of a strong cytokine channel.118 Y. Cheng and E.W. Newell5.Abundant markers: Cellular markers that usually have bimodal distribu- tion can be labeled with less sensitive channels. Notably, markers that are coexpressed and traditionally paired up for investigating T cells, such asCD45RA vs CCR7 and CD127 vs KLRG-1, could be used on lowersensitivity channels that are far apart for better resolution withoutsacrificing upper mass channels. 6.Lineage markers: The markers indicate cell lineage, including CD45,CD3, CD4, and CD8, are relatively the most abundant markers on cells.They should be located in some of the weakest metal channels. How-ever, one should also consider the minimum resolution required when gating on target cells, or paired up one \"dim\" channel with one mod- erate channel to identify target lineage cell. Markers that are lineage-specific and exclusive from each other could also be put in the adjacent\"dim\" channels that have less purity. 7.\"Dump\" markers: Markers that are least important and only for exclud-ing unwanted cells can be put together into dim channel, leaving moremetal channels to probe marker of interest. Overall, these principles are mainly based on our experience and should be examined and varied between experiments. Importantly, to best use mass cytometry for its accessibility of investigating T cells in such depth, oneshould designate the panel more systemically to comprehensively probethe T cells heterogeneity or relationship between cellular properties. 5. PROBING T CELL SPECIFICITY: FROM SINGLE TO MULTIPLEX TETRAMER Identifying antigen-specific T cells and understanding their roles dur- ing immune responses against invading pathogen have been the central com-ponent of adaptive immunity. Conventional approaches in defining such antigen-specific T cells in human differ greatly, mainly al., 2007 ). Seminal work by Altman et al. showed that recombinantly produced tetramers of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I can provide high avidity for TCR to directly probe antigen-specific T cells ( Altman et al., 1996 ). This allows the assessment of antigen-specific T cell phenotype ex vivo withoutmanipulation of cells. Queen hypothesis ( Van Valen, 1974a, 1974b ) describes the rapidly evolving interaction between host and pathogen ( Clarke et al.,119 Deep Profiling Human T Cell Heterogeneity1994) that drives molecular coevolution by continuous natural selection for host adaptation (eg, immune escape). This is supported by the highly poly- morphic nature of HLA (human MHC), and the enormous breadth andnumbers of T cell epitopes that can be encoded by viruses ( Newell & Davis, 2014 ). It is therefore important to broadly probe the recognition of numerous epitopes during immune response against a given virus, espe- cially as the virus may rapidly evolve and allow for persistent infection. The power of tetramer technology has recently been increased exponen- tially. The breakthrough UV-cleavable peptide-MHC exchange approach( tetramer strategy ( Hadrup et al., 2009; Newell, Klein, Yu, & Davis, 2009 ) have facilitated the discovery of novel antigen-specific T cells in a high-throughput manner. This uniquecombinatorial tetramer strategy involves what we will as and compu-tational deconvolution scheme ( Fig. 1 ) enables the simultaneous detection of hundreds of antigen specificities ( Newell et al., 2013 ) (unpublished data) in a single human sample with automated epitope identification. The methodo- logical details have reported and reviewed elsewhere ( Harvey & Wucherpfennig, 2013; Newell & Davis, 2014; Newell et al., 2013 ). The key component of combinatorial tetramer staining is the assignment of mul- tiple streptavidin coding. It can be achieved by using a simple R-written algo- rithm to create the unique scrambled combination codings foreach given tetramer. After UV-exchanging the peptide of thesestreptavidin mixtures are used to tetramerize the assigned peptide-MHC. The numbers of unique combinations depends on the number of metal chan- nel that are dedicated for different streptavidins. A demonstration withdetailed procedures of this technique can be found elsewhere ( Leong & Newell, 2015 ). Recently, we have successfully expanded this approach using 1001 unique codings to simultaneously probe 563 candidate CD8+Tc e l l antigens in peripheral blood of chronically HBV (hepatitis B virus) infected patients (unpublished data). 5.2 Combinatorial Tetramer Deconvolution Scheme Traditional identification of tetramer-positive cells relies on the expert man-ual gating by comparing with isotype or tetramer loaded with irrelevant120 Y. Cheng and E.W. Newellpeptide. However, this can be confounded and is subjective to the researcher's expectation. In addition, rare antigen-specific T cells or T cell with low-affinity TCR are very difficult to be confidently identifiedon a 2D dotplot ( Wooldridge et al., 2009 ). This is especially problematic when studying antigen-specific T cell in patients with persistent viral infec-tion, such as HBV ( Reignat et al., 2002 ) and HCV ( Schmidt et al., 2011 ), where low frequencies of antigen-specific cells are expected. Furthermore, if manual gating were to be used together with the highly multiplex tetramer scheme, it may be very difficult to verify any tetramer-positive cells in an objective manner. Instead, using several preset signal thresholds, the tetramer deconvolution algorithm objectively and quantifies the dif-ferent on cells based on theapplied combinatorial tetramer strategy ( Newell et al., 2013 ). It provides high detection sensitivity while reducing background noise and unspecific binding of tetramer. In addition, identified tetramer-positive cells can befurther self-verified by calculating the correspondence between two config-urations of streptavidin coding from the same patient donor. Importantly, even the significance of rare antigen-specific T cells can be robustly distin- guished and statistically quantified by this approach. It is our opinion that thecomputational schemes we are using offers a promising method to investi-gate human antigen-specific T cell in an unprecedented level. 6. DISSECTING MASS CYTOMETRY DATA: HIGH- DIMENSIONAL DATA ANALYSIS Traditional visualization using hierarchical subgating schemes based on the marker expression on biaxial dotplots has provided a straightforward approach to analyze flow cytometry data. However, subjective manual gat- ing is based on expert training and expectation, which could vary betweenresearchers and laboratories. The characterization of subsets could betherefore biased. The FlowCAP (Flow Cytometry: Critical Assessment of Population Identification Methods) consortium and several groups have established various computational methods to improve the precision andaccuracy of flow cytometry analysis ( Aghaeepour et al., 2013 methods include density-, model-, or nonparametric clustering-based methods, which have open access and are easily available using R or MATLAB source code.121 Deep Profiling Human T Cell HeterogeneityGiven the complexity and high dimensionality of mass cytometry data, limitations in the utility of biaxial gating approaches are immediately apparent and this has forced the adaptation and development of many high-dimensionaldata analysis methods ( Bendall et al., 2012; Newell & Davis, 2014 ). However, we would like to emphasize the importance of the use of standard dotplotswith mass cytometry for demonstrating the accuracy of staining and a means of validating findings in a clear and comprehensible way. Beyond this though, current platforms for high-dimensional ( >10 dimensions) cytometric data analysis are mostly based on \"Clustering\" approaches, \"DimensionalityReduction\" methods, or combinations thereof ( Fig. 2 ). Other reports have also used conventional hierarchical clustering approach ( Mingueneau et al., 2014; Wolchinsky et ), or conditional density estimation, DREVI/DREAMI ( Krishnaswamy et al., 2014 ), to study T cell receptor acti- vation and signaling cascades. Noteworthy, most of the analytical methods use nonparametric model (eg, kernel density estimation or k-NNs), as the prob- ability assumption (eg, reference ellipsoid) of parametric statistics is question-able for complex cellular population in high-dimensional space. 6.1 Clustering Analysis SPADE, Spanning Tree Progression of Density Normalized Events, was oneof the first used methods for visually pleasing high-dimensional cytometricdata analysis. Bendall et al. used this analytical approach to study the immune response of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) under drug intervention ( Bendall et al., 2011 ). is a density normalization agglomerative clustering algorithm that visualizes the fold change of marker expressionof cellular data on branches of MST (Minimum spanning tree) structure ( Qiu et al., 2011 ). The derived method, Citrus ( Bruggner et al., 2014 ), was improved for multiple samples analysis ( >10 samples). It identifies cel- lular clusters that are linked to different experimental end points with bio-logical interpretable metrics using regression analysis. Interestingly, Citrus identified a specific T cell cluster that inversely associated with AIDS-free survival risk in HIV-infected patients ( Bruggner et al., ), and has a na\u00a8ve-like (CD27hiCD28hiCCR7hiCD45ROlo) CD8+T cells phenotype in line with previous report using traditional flow cytometry analysis( Ganesan et al., 2010 ). SPADE and Citrus create uniform density by downsampling cytometric data to visualize the cellular relationship in high-dimensional space.Although it has been shown to be useful, the MST structure loses single-cell122 Y. Cheng and E.W. Newellresolution and is susceptible to local variation. To overcome the pitfall, Zunder et al. replaced MST with connected graph structure between cellu- lar clusters that based on local density, named FLOW-MAP ( Zunder, Lujan, Goltsev, Wernig, & Nolan, 2015 ). A robust visualization for complex cellular network should accommodate unsupervised referenced clustering and subjective definition of cellular cluster. Scaffold (single-cell analysis by fixed force- and landmark-directed) map pro- vides such approach ( Spitzer et al., 2015 ). It positions landmark cell population (eg, CD4, CD8, B cell, dendritic cell, and natural killer cells) and connect sim-ilar cell clusters (nodes) by borders with a length correspond to their cosine similarity using force-directed graphs. Given the tissue-specific characteristics of T cell, the authors showed a unique visualization of T cell (ie, CD4, CD8,Treg, MAIT, and T cells) landscape across 10 different tissues. Working on different concepts, Levine et al. modeled high-dimensional space of cells using a matrix of single-cell measurements that cluster the most phenotypic similar cells in set of k-neighborhoods, resulting a graph struc- ture, PhenoGraph 2015 ). Interestingly, parti- tions the interrelated cellular graph into the phe- notypic relationship between cells. PhenoGraph applies this community (ie,modules or clusters) detection method to find the maximum modularity ofdata network, giving dense connections between cells within clusters but dispersed connection between cells from different clusters. 6.2 Dimensionality Reduction Analysis Dimensionality reduction method is another favorable analytical tool for high-dimensional cytometric data. It reduces the number of random vari-ables under different purpose-driven considerations by feature extraction.Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely used in many biolog- ical datasets and is the first of its type proposed for such purpose. PCA ( Hotelling, 1933; Pearson, 1901 ) digests the high-dimensional cellular data into manageable surrogate variables (principal components) in a linear fash-ion in such a way that the first and second principal components contain thelargest possible variance, and segregated major populations that resemble their relatedness. Several groups, including ours, have applied PCA in ana- lyzing human peripheral CD8 +T cells ( Fergusson et al., 2014; Newell et al., 2012, 2013; Sen et al., 2014; Swadling et al., 2014 ), and shown a great123 Deep Profiling Human T Cell Heterogeneitymagnitude of T cell heterogeneity within a continuum of cell differentiation and polyfunctionality ( Newell et al., 2012 ). Fergusson et al. used PCA and mass cytometry to reveal the functional and phenotypic diversity of CD161-expressiong CD8 +T cells ( Fergusson et al., 2014 ). Another group adapted the same approach to describe the phenotypic changes of tonsilar CD4+and CD8+T cells in VZV infection ( Sen et al., 2014 ). Besides delineating the T cells in global population, the definite pheno- types between different antigen-specific T cells can be conveniently distin-guished and visualized under the utilization of PCA. Newell et al. showedthe functional distinct CMV, EBV, and FLU (Influenza A)-specific T cells located in regions of central memory (T CM), effector memory (T EM), to late- stage effector cells on PCA visualization, respectively ( Newell et al., 2012 ). We later demonstrated the unique phenotype of Rotavirus VP3-specific CD8+T cells in intestinal epithelium, effector-like phenotype expressing integrin- 7a n d et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, vaccine- induced HCV-specific CD8+T cells also occupied a distinct memory niche compared to FLU- and CMV-specific CD8+T cells using PCA in a human clinical trial ( Swadling et al., 2014 ). Although it is clear that PCA is effective in inferring the interrelationship of subsets for high-dimensional cytometric data, the resolution is limited byits nature of linear transformation. Endowing a different scope, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( t-SNE) ( van der Maaten Hinton, 2008 ) calculates the probability distribution of pairwise distances of points (cells) in high-dimensional metric space, giving similar points high probability and dissimilar points infinitesimal probability of being chosen, and embeds thepoints with respect to the distances on a two-dimensional (or three) map.It has been used to visually determine immune cell subsets ( Amir el et al., 2013), and worked exceptionally well in identification of rare population (Becher et al., 2014 ). The impressive utility of t-SNE analysis has been proved in uncovering high-dimensional cytometric data of CD4+ T helper cells ( Wong et al., 2015 ), Treg ( Mason et al., 2015 ), and CD8+ T cells ( Cheng et al., 2016; Shekhar et al., 2014 ). Moreover, t-SNE is well capable of integrating with other machine learning methods to better inter-pret high-dimensional cytometric data. Levine et al. recently combinedt-SNE with PhenoGraph ( Levine et al., 2015 ) to acquire the different util- ities of dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis ( Fig. ). McHeyzer- Williams and colleagues used t-SNE on fluorescence flow cytometry data to identify four different GC (germinal center) B cells subsets and furtherloaded these cells onto Wanderlust (discussed later) to predict their124 Y. Cheng and E.W. stages produces high resolution of cellular separation while maintaining single-cell visualization, but it requires manual gating of cell clusters.Building automation to better identify cell subsets on t-SNE, automatic classification of cellular expression by nonlinear embedding (ACCENSE) ( Shekhar et al., 2014 ) computes the probability and peak of local density to automatically cluster cell subsets. ACCENSE automaticallyidentified more than 20 different CD8 +T cells subpopulations in mice blood based on 35 measured parameters. To further improve the automated cell cluster detection, we developed DensVM (density-based clustering) (Becher et al., 2014 ), a modified form of ACCENSE, to calculated cluster boundary based on k-nearest neighbor and cluster cells using machine learn- ing SVM (support vector machine). Combining t-SNE and DensVM, we have identified the extremely heterogeneous CD4+T helper subsets across tonsil and blood, with six na \u00a8ve T cells clusters and multiple functional effec- tor or memory cells, including T H1, T H17, and T FH(Wong et al., 2015 ). Uniquely, ACCENSE and DensVM are the only two current methods incorporate both clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithm for high-dimensional cytometric analysis ( Fig. 2 ). An effective reference map should enable unsupervised identification of cell with a data-driven organization that is flexible enough to accommodatedifferent types of measurements. We have recently developed One-SENSE (One-dimensional Soli-Expression by Nonlinear Stochastic Embedding) to orchestrate the cell using t-SNE with purpose-driven categorical analysis of cellular marker expression ( Cheng et al., 2016 ). It projects the cells using one- dimensional t-SNE analysis based on the predefined cellular category. Cells are binned and embedded defined by their categorical expression on One- SENSE map. This framework recalls the marker expressions that immersein other high-dimensional cytometric analysis without the necessity of exces-sive marker annotation. This improvement provides the opportunity to unbiasedly depict all possible combinations of proteins coexpression examined in the experiment. We have used this unique approach to decipher functionalCD8 +Tc e l l s( w i t h >12 different coexpressions by 15 functional parameters) and Treg heterogeneity. One of the major goals in single-cell measurement is to understand the progression of cellular state (eg, differentiation and function). It is a great interest to model cell trajectory to resolve potential T cell heterogeneity dur-ing immune response. Isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP) ( Tenenbaum,125 Deep Profiling Human T Cell Heterogeneityde Silva, & Langford, 2000 ) preserves local metric and embeds the intrinsic geometry nonlinearly in a low-dimensional map by determining geodesic distances between cells and estimating each cell's neighbors in a given man-ifold. We have previously used ISOMAP to mimic the cell phenotypic pro-gression ( Becher et al., 2014; Wong et ISOMAP captured the path of phenotypic continuum of tonsilar and blood T FHjudging by functional and CD57) ( Wong al., 2015 to neither clustering nor dimensionality reduction methods, Wan- derlust, another cell trajectory detection technique developed by Bendall et al. (2014) for studying the progression and regulatory pathway during B cell development. By using prechosen \"early cell\" and random waypoint cells,Wanderlust nonlinearly connects cells that have similar expression profileand aligns the cells into a nearest neighbor graph with shortest paths based on pseudotime estimation algorithm. Recently, an improved method for analyzing single-cell trajectory and differentiation was ), a dimension reduction algorithm using dif- fusion distance to preserve the data structure as a branched continuum. Haghverdi et al. refined the transition probability matrix to determine thediffusion distance between pair cells through all possible paths. It simulatesthe dynamics of cell differentiation while resisting to noise and samplingdensity heterogeneities. An advanced version, Destiny ( Angerer et al., 2015), was introduced upon the preparation of this manuscript. Diffusion map may show a better performance in analyzing an existing HSC sequenc-ing data, but how would it represent the T cell differentiation or functionaltrajectory needs to be further addressed. 7. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES The complexity of T cell heterogeneity is currently being explored by the conjunction of mass cytometry and high-dimensional cytometric anal-ysis. Along with tetramer strategy,immunologists can now further delve into the specificity of various types of T cells ( Newell & Davis, 2014 ). However, it does not demote the signif- icance of flow cytometry. Mass cytometry cannot easily replace some impor-tant utilities of flow cytometry, such as cell proliferation (CFSE) assay andFACS-based cell sorting. It is more sensible to integrate these two methodsbased on the experiment purposes. To foster the maximum usage of mass126 Y. Cheng and E.W. Newellcytometry, further advancement is also needed. This includes increase the purity of metal isotopes, development of polymer for bi- and quadrivalent isotopes, and the better efficiency of cell introduction system. Conventionally, most flow cytometry have focused on one or few types of cellular markers in single experiment because of the limited parameters. Giventhe multiparametric measurement of mass cytometry, we should aim for designing a more systemic panel to study T cell heterogeneity by assigning markers into different categories based on their cellular properties, such as dif-ferentiation, function, and trafficking. It can directly test the hypothesis of thecritical relationship between different categorical T cell states. For instance, to evaluate the deviated cell trafficking profiles of T FHin different virus infection as recently proposed ( Bentebibel et al., 2013; Locci et al., 2013; Schmitt & Ueno, 2015 ). Or, to help resolve controversies surrounding T cell asymmetry division ( Arsenio et al., 2015; Flossdorf et al., 2015 ) effector and mem- ory cell differentiation program ( Arsenio et al., 2014 ) using mass cytometry and high-dimensional cytometric analysis. We also anticipate that mass cyto-metry is capable of isolating immune subsets that require many markers toidentify in valuable human patient samples, such as innate (ILC) ( Diefenbach, Colonna, & n d myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( Pallett et al., 2015 ). Considering the high dimensionality on each single human T cell, the tra- ditional bivariate dotplots might not be sufficient to reflect the T cell hetero-geneity. Using functional CD8 Dutton, 2003 ) cells have received the most attention than other functionality, fewer havebeen done in addressing other heterogeneity. Moreover, hierarchical sub-gating strategies make it difficult to overview all the possible coexpressions. Researchers need to have preexisting knowledge to subjectively anticipate any possible coexpression. Second, the information behind the double posi-tive population on bivariate dotplot is also missing from the visualization.These generated potential biased interpretation of T cell functionality. Alter- native high-dimensional analysis approaches (eg, One-SENSE) that acquire the utility of unsupervised cell visualization with subjective experimentparameters for different analytical purposes could provide a methodologicalsolution. 8. CONCLUDING REMARKS In 1910s, James B. Murphy first proposed the remarkable role of lym- phocytes in rejection of tissue allografts and protection against infection127 Deep Profiling Human T Cell Heterogeneity(Murphy, 1914a, 1914b ). However, his works were left vastly unnoticed for almost half century, until Arnold Rich and James Gowans recognized its sig- nificance ( Silverstein, 2001 ). With the increase in accessibility of various technologies and resources in the past decades, scientists now have morecapability to dissect the complex human immune cell network, especiallythe discrepancy of T cell role in different contexts of diseases. Taken together, the presence of mass cytometry and high-dimensional cytometric analysis has joined the frontline of immunological and biomed-ical discovery, along with flow cytometry, single-cell mRNA-sequencing,and TCR sequencing. We believe this hybrid technology could substantially contribute in the exploration of human T cells from bench to bedside, such as disease prognosis, vaccine, and therapeutic design.

In mice, GANP depletion in B cells impairs antibody affinity maturation. Conversely, its transgenic over- expression augments the generation of high-affinity antigen-specific B cells. GANP asso-ciates with AID in the cytoplasm, shepherds AID into the nucleus, and augments itsaccess to the rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) region of the genome inB cells, thereby precipitating the somatic hypermutation of V region genes. GANP is alsoupregulated in human CD4 +T cells and is associated with APOBEC3G (A3G). GANP inter- acts with A3G and escorts it to the virion cores to potentiate its antiretroviral activity byinactivating HIV-1 genomic associatedwith cytidine deaminase family molecules in generating diversity of theIgV region of the genome and genetic alterations of exogenously introduced viral tar-gets. GANP, encoded by human chromosome 21, as well as its mouse equivalent on chromosome 10, contains a region homologous to Saccharomyces Sac3 that was char- acterized as a component of the transcription/export 2 (TREX-2) complex and waspredicted to be involved in RNA export and metabolism in mammalian cells. Themetabolism of RNA during its maturation, from the transcription site at the chromo-some within the nucleus to the cytoplasmic translation apparatus, needs to be elabo-rated with regard to acquired and innate immunity. In this review, we summarize thecurrent knowledge on GANP as a component of TREX-2 in mammalian cells. 1. INTRODUCTION Higher organisms have developed a system of self-defense against genetic material, such as viruses and retrotransposon elements invading cells, which involves the induction of cytidine deamination by AID/APOBEC136 N. Sakaguchi and K. Maedafamily members and finally the generation of diverse effector molecule antibodies (Abs) for acquired immunity. The AID/APOBEC family consists of 5 members in mice and 11 members in humans ( Conticello, Thomas, Petersen-Mahrt, & Neuberger, 2005 ). The catalysis by the members differs between RNA and single-stranded (ss) DNA molecules, although thedetails of their targets remain to be determined. AID is well characterized as a molecule that is essential for the diversification of immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) regions and class-switch recombination (CSR) in B cells.AID expression is selective to activated B cells, particularly in germinalcenters (GCs) in the peripheral lymphoid organs after antigen (Ag) immu- nization, and targets ssDNA. We have been studying the molecules upregulated specifically in GC B cells upon immunization with T-cell-dependent Ags (TD-Ags) by anapproach using monoclonal Abs (mAbs). One of these mAbs recognizes a molecule that appears in the light zone of GCs and a study of its cDNA clone indicated that its transcripts of over 6 kb in length appeared in the lightzone of GCs by in situ hybridization ( Kuwahara et al., 2000 ). The putative protein was novel, with no known sequence similarity to mammalian molecules, and was predicted to be a 210-kDa nuclear protein-designated germinal center B-cell-associated nuclear protein (GANP). The centralregion of was shown to be homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sac3, which was identified as a gene involved in the actin assembly( Bauer & Kolling, 1996 ). To distinguish it from its mammalian counterpart, here, we add the letter \"y\" in front of the yeast homologue, namely, ySac3. ySac3 was subsequently characterized as a component of the mRNA exportcomplex in yeast, namely, the transcription/export-2 (TREX-2) complex( & Aguilera, 2003 ). GANP shown to interact with the AID/APOBEC family of cyti- dine deaminases, such as AID in GC B cells and APOBEC3G (A3G) inactivated human T cells, and to be involved in the targeting of AID/ APOBEC family proteins to their appropriate target nucleotide sequences ( Maeda et al., 2010, 2013 ). Since the mRNA export machinery is diverse in the cells of higher mammals and transcribes the complex structures ofcoding and noncoding genes assembling their exon -intron arrangements, our current knowledge of it is limited, so there is a need for com- parisons with data on the homologues in lower eukaryotic cell models. GANP is involved not only in B cell IgV region diversification, but alsoin the escort of AID/APOBEC family cytidine deaminases, along Protein GANPthe of self-defense. The mRNA export function of TREX-2 should be clarified as an important issue in immunological research. 2. AFFINITY MATURATION AND AB SPECIFICITY The molecular mechanisms by which an Ab specifically recognizes a pathogen and eliminates it from the body and how diverse forms of Abs areproduced have been focused on for a long time in immunology. In his selec-tion theory, Burnet suggested that receptor -ligand specificity has a genetic basis, which was later confirmed to involve somatic-cell Ig gene rearrangements that generate enormous diversity in the specific IgV regionas a primary repertoire ( Tonegawa, 1983 ). Pauling attempted to explain the mechanism by which the diversification of receptor specificity occurs inlymphocytes after encountering an Ag as a ligand, using his \"instructive theory\" ( Pauling, 1940 ). Later studies demonstrated the alteration of recep- tor affinities by the accumulation of somatic mutations in the IgV region Pumphrey, & Heller, 1984 ), which was shown to be important in the affinity maturation of Abs, particularly for soluble Ags. In fact, the effectiveness of an Ab in the primary immune response is often limited and insufficient to eliminate path-ogens in order to prevent various infectious diseases; it needs to be aug-mented in the form of affinity maturation by a vaccination. While the obtained results did not prove the validity of instruction theory, the second- ary diversification of the IgV region was shown to involve the somatichypermutation (SHM) mechanism during the immune response, which iscritical for adaptive immunity. 2.1 Germinal Centers Gray's anatomy of the human body describes this region in the lymph nodesas follows: \"The nodules or follicles in the cortical portion of the gland fre-quently show, in their centers, areas where karyokinetic figures indicate adivision of the lymph corpuses. These areas are termed germ centers.\" Our understanding of the physiological role of the lymphoid aggregates of lymphoid tissue was promoted by a presentation by Bob White at the firstPrague meeting. Then, in 1981, Walther Flemming, who was studying celldivision, more specifically pointed out a region of large lymphocytes under- going mitosis as a GC in the follicles lymph nodes ( Nieuwenhuis & Opstelten, 1984 ). GCs are defined as a microenvironment138 N. Sakaguchi and K. Maedathat supports the proliferation and differentiation of Ag-specific B cells dur- ing the initial 3 weeks after Ag stimulation ( Hollowood & Macartney, 1992; & MacLennan, 1991 ), undergoing CSR from the IgM isotype in peripheral lymphoid organs ( Kraal, Weissman, & Butcher, 1982 ), with the binding of high levels of peanut agglutinin ( Rose, Booth, Habeshaw, & Robertson, 1982 ), particularly in Peyer's patches ( Butcher et al., 1982 ). T cells are involved in GC formation and the generation of B cell memory ( Jacobson, Caporale, 1963 ). Earlier studies had already suggested the possibility that some activated B cells enter follicles where they reencounter the relevant Ag (immune complexes) localized onthe surface of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) ( Mandel, 1980; van Rooijen, 1972 ) and proliferate further without differentiating into Ab-secreting plasma cells (Coico & Thorbecke, 1985 ). Thus, GCs are associated with the clonal expansion of Ag-specific B cells ( Jacob al., 1991; Kallberg, Gray, & Leanderson, 1993 ), selection of B cells for high-affinity Ag-binding potentialities ( Liu et al., 1989 ), and subsequent differentiation into plasma 1989; Tew et al., 1992 ) or entry into the memory B cell pool ( Coico, Bhogal, & Thorbecke, 1983; Klaus et al., 1980 2.2 Selection of GC B Cells Centrocytes of GCs are sensitive to apoptosis, presumably favoring to theselection for the affinity maturation of B cell Ag receptor (BCR) by IgVregion SHM. The survival of GC B cells can be achieved in vitro for a longer period by stimulation with anti-CD40 mAb ( Holder et ( Butch & Nahm, 1992; Holder, Grafton, Finney, 1995;Mangeney, Richard, Coulaud, Tursz, & Wiels, 1991 ). These suggest a model in which CD40L and IL-4 are located on the surface of FDCs to maintain long-term survival ( Gray, Kosco, & Kosco, ). FDCs, the organelles of cells with active secretory and endocytic properties, but being quite different from139 AID-Associated Protein GANPmacrophages, are present in both the GC and the adjacent mantle region of secondary follicles ( Chen, Adams, & Steinman, 1978; Chen, Frank, Adams, & Steinman, 1978 ). 2.3 Structure of GCs MacLennan and coworkers described the structure of GCs with microenvi-ronmental zones as a \"dark zone\" localized near the base and a \"light zone\" at the apex of the follicular structure ( Johnson, Gordon, & MacLennan, 1992; MacLennan, 1992, 1994 ). The cell-cycle of B cells in the dark zone was estimated around 6 h in the form of centroblasts with the highest mitoticactivity ( Liu et al., 1992 ). The FDC network is extended in the light zone as the apical light zone with CD23hiFDCs and the basal light zone with CD23loFDCs ( Khan, & MacLennan, 1993 ). Small follic- ular B cells appear at the outer edge of the FDC network to form the fol-licular mantle, which is clearly demarcated from the central portion of the follicle. The light zone was shown to contain smaller and less closely packed lymphoid cells named centrocytes that had not proliferated in the 12 h sincethe last cell-cycle ( Hanna, 1964 ). Current real-time imaging studies have shown the dynamic migration of B cells across the two GC zones ( Allen, Okada, Tang, & Cyster, 2007; Hauser et al., 2007; Schwickert et al., 2007 ) with similar characteristics of cell division and cell death, partially dependent on the altered expressionof the chemokine CXCL13 and surface CXCR4 expression ( Allen et al., 2004 ). GC B cells progress through the cell-cycle in both dark and light zones ( Allen et al., 2007; Hauser et al., 2007; Rahman, Rao, Kalled, & Manser, 2003; Wang & Carter, 2005 ). The dynamic alteration in the two compartments between the light zone and the dark zone implies the indi-vidual functional properties of centrocytes and centroblasts with respect to cell size, cell-cycle progression, CSR for the selec- tion of high-affinity Ab-producing B cells during immune responses. 3. MOLECULES ASSOCIATED WITH AB AFFINITY MATURATION A range of mutant mice produced by the gene targeting of various B-cell-associated molecules exhibited impaired GC formation: MHC classII-deficient ( al., 1991 ), transgenic ( Lane et al., 1994 CD28-deficient ( Ferguson, Han, Xu et al., 1994 et al., 1995; Togni et al., 1994; Matsumoto et al., 1997 ). Mutant mice with deficiencies in T/B cell cooperation also showed impaired affinity maturation, such as MHC class II-deficient, human mice. However, LT- -deficient mice did not show a clear deficiency in affinity maturation upon immunization with TD-Ags, indicating that affinity maturation is not stric tly dependent on GC formation ( Matsumoto et al., 1996 ). 3.1 Neuberger's Model of SHM Generation by AID After extensive studies in many laboratories attempting to identify the\"hypermutator at the IgV region\" enzyme, Honjo's group discovered a molecule named AID that is essential for triggering both SHM and CSR ( Muramatsu et al., 1999, 2000 ), which was proved coincidentally using the B cells in a group of immunodeficient patients ( Revy et al., 2000 ). Gene targeting of AID in mice caused a deficiency of IgV SHM, resulting in theimpairment of affinity maturation, and CSR upon immunization with TD-Ags, but could generate the formation of larger GCs in the splenic follicles after 2 weeks of immunization; thus, IgV region SHM and affinitymaturation are not necessarily associated with GC formation. The cytidinedeaminase activity of AID was shown to be consistently strong in converting dC to dU in ssDNA in an in vitro deamination & Goodman, 2003 ). Neuberger's model clearly explains the molecular mechanism after the initial cytidine deamination, creating thetransition mutation from dC to dU and subsequently to dT on the target strand, accompanied by dG to dA on the opposite strand as reviewed ( Di Noia & Neuberger, 2007 ). This nucleotide pair mismatch might be pas- sed on to the daughter cells during DNA replication in B cells, but is oftenprocessed by uracil nucleotidyl-glycosylase, generating a basic site to be rep-laced by any four nucleotides (dC, dG, dA, and dT) for transversion muta- tions after replication or providing a fragile site at which DNA cleavage occurs and is then targeted for DNA repair by short patch repair or long frag-ment DNA region. In GC B cells, various error-prone DNA polymerases141 AID-Associated Protein GANPgenerate more extensive alterations in the adjacent segments in the IgV region ( Weill & Reynaud, 2008 ). The principle behind DNA damage repair systems involves the analogous biochemical pathways of base excisionrepair and nucleotide excision repair; they enable organisms to respondrapidly to massive DNA damage by copying undamaged and damagedDNA using the class of error-prone DNA polymerases ( Goodman, 2002 ). The catalytic reaction of the enzymes in this class results in low accuracy of nucleotide incorporation, with a base substitution frequency of 10/C01to 10/C03. Error-prone DNA polymerases play critical roles in IgV region SHM in mammals in different profiles with Pol (Rogozin, Pavlov, Bebenek, Matsuda, & Kunkel, 2001; Zeng et al., 2001 ), Pol (Zan et al., 2001 ), and Pol (Poltoratsky et al., 2001 ). 3.2 B-Cell Lymphoma 6 and B Lymphocyte Maturation Protein-1 An important regulator of GC B cells is B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6), which is a transcriptional repressor of the Broad complex, Tramtrack and Bric-a- brac/Pox virus and zinc finger (BTB/POZ) family ( Deweindt et al., 1995 ), the translocation of which was identified in diffuse large B cell lymphoma( Ye et al., 1993 ). BCL6-deficient mice show normal B cell development, but cannot form mature GCs and lack affinity maturation upon immuniza- tion with TD-Ags ( Dent, Shaffer, Yu, Allman, 1997 increases GC formation et al., 2005 ). The roles of BCL6 expression and signaling toward its transcription have been described elsewhere as an excel- lent review ( Klein & Dalla-Favera, 2008 ). ) and an acetylation reaction to BCL6 through an unknown mechanism ( Bereshchenko, Gu, & Dalla-Favera, 2002 ). Since BCL6 binds to the regulatory elements of various target genes at the consensus DNA sequence TTCCT(A/C)GAA( Chang, Ye, Chaganti, & Dalla-Favera, 1996; Seyfert, Allman, He, & Staudt, 1996 ) by interacting with multiple distinct components of repressors such as SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptor) (Ahmad et al., 2003; et al., 2013; Polo et al., 2004 ), the repressive activity presumably covers many biological functions: (1) inhibition of B cell activation (BCL6, CD69, CD80), N. Sakaguchi and K. Maeda(CDKN1A), (3) inhibition of DNA damage response (p53 and ATR), (4) inhibition of plasma cell differentiation (PRDM1 and IRF4), and (5) inhi- bition of memory B cell differentiation. BCL6 is also expressed in CD4+ T cells and is involved in the establishment of GC T follicular helper(T FH)cells by repressing the transcription (T-bet), GATA3, and ROR t(Johnston et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012; Marshall et al., 2011; Nurieva et al., 2009; Pepper, Pagan, Igyarto, Taylor, & Jenkins, 2011; Yu et al., 2009 ). Thus, the complex mechanistic roles of BCL6 in the differentiation of GC B cells and lymphomagenesis have remained as a focusof study ( Bunting & Melnick, 2013 ). A counter regulator of BCL6 is B lymphocyte maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), which was cloned from BCL1 murine lymphoma upon differen-tiation to a plasma state ( Turner, Mack, & Davis, 1994 ). The enforced expression of Blimp-1 drives mature B cells to become Ab-producing plasma cells ( Angelin-Duclos, acts as a to reduce the expression of PRDM1 that encodes Blimp-1; this in turn suppresses the maturation of GC B cells into Ab-secreting plasma cells ( Chang et al., 1996; Dent et al., 1997; Fukuda et al., 1997; Reljic, Wagner, Peakman, & Fearon, 2000; Shaffer et al., 2000 ) by targeting genes including c-myc (Eilers, 1999; Lin, Wong, & Calame, 1997 with increases of BCL6 and SWAP-70, proteins that play critical roles in GC formation ( Allman et al., 1996; Dent et Falini al., 1997; Onizuka et al., 1995; Qi al.,1999; Ye et al., 1997 ). BCL6 physically interacts with PU.1 and is recruited to the PU.1-binding sites of Ig and30enhancer regions, suggesting the complex repressor activities on various genes involved in the regulation of GC B cell maturation ( Wei, Zaprazna, Wang, & Atchison, 2009 ). In the conventional GC model, the dark zone and light zone of GCs are thoughtto contain Ag-stimulated B cells with different proliferation rates. Thecentroblasts rapidly proliferate for clonal expansion in the dark zone by suppressing further differentiation into plasmablasts; in contrast, centrocytes are thought to be cell-cycle-arrested small B cells expressing the maturehigher-affinity BCR, which will be selected by the FDC network. Although143 AID-Associated Protein GANPa recent in vitro vital imaging study demonstrated the periodic transition and cell-cycle progression by cycling between the centroblast and centrocyte stages ( De Silva & Klein, 2015 ), the notion of these distinct subpopulations might be still implicative and would be an issue for the molecular analysis.The genes with increased transcription in centroblasts from na \u00a8ve B cells are: (1) involved in DNA replication (eg, PCNA), (2) encode cyclins and various G2/M and other mitoticproducts components of the centrosome, spindle, and kinetochore.Interestingly, c-myc expression was found to be lower in centroblasts than in centrocytes ( Klein et al., 2003 ). In centroblasts, there was the upregulation of genes associated with DNA repair, such as PMS2 ,MLH1 ,MSH6 ,a n d OGG1 , recombination, such as BRCA-1 ,Rad2 , Exo1 ,a n d DNA ligase 1 Similarly, in human follicular lymphoma cells, ). 3.4 Lyn One of the Src-family tyrosine kinases, Lyn, is a key mediator of B cell acti- vation pathways through interaction Lier, and is involved in phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif in the accessory molecules, leading to initiation of the tyrosine phosphory-lation cascade to Ig /Ig( Saouaf et al., 1994 Btk, Syk, (Lyn/C0//C0) mice, the generation of IgV region SHM and affinity maturation was mildly impaired uponimmunization with a hapten, 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP)-chicken -globulin (CGG), indicating that the Lyn signal is not an absolute require- ment for the generation of IgV SHM. Nevertheless, upon /C0//C0chicken DT40 B cells with the wild-type (wt) DT40, the former showed changes of the expression of 45 genes, and the significant decreased genes in their expression were further selected, including those involved in BCR signaling ( CD74, CD22, cross-linking signal mediates Lyn activation, leading to STAT activation through a Jak-independent mechanism ( Wang, Kurosaki, & Corey, 2007 ), but Lyn also promotes the activation of PU.1, presumably resulting in the upregulation of PU.1-dependent molecules in GC B cells ( Mirnics et al., 2004 ). 4. GERMINAL CENTER B-CELL-ASSOCIATED NUCLEAR PROTEIN 4.1 Expression of GANP in GCs As described earlier, various approaches have been applied in numerous lab- oratories to identify the molecules expressed in the GC area in mice and humans. A mAb prepared by the immunization of mouse B cell lymphoma recognized a protein expressed at a higher level in the GC area of the spleenafter immunization with TD-Ag, sheep red blood cell (SRBC) ( Kuwahara et al., 2000 ). Although the protein is ubiquitously expressed in many kinds of somatic cell, similarly to BCL6, immunohistochemical analysis clearly demonstrated its upregulation in GCs. A isolated by mAb screening using the gt-11 phage cDNA library was shown to encode a 210-kDa nuclear protein. In situ hybridization revealed its marked upregu-lation in the GC area of both mouse spleen and human tonsil; thus, the protein was designated as GANP given its upregulation in immune cells. The transcription of ganp and expression of GANP protein were found to be augmented after 48 h of stimulation with anti-IgM Ab and CD40 cross-linking in B cells in vitro, and the phosphorylation at Ser502 (pSer502) was augmented by stimulation with CD40 cross-linking in vitro and in GC B cells in vivo, particularly in the apical region of the mouse GC area( Kuwahara et al., 2001 ). Promoter analysis of the mouse ganp gene also showed the presence of a PU.1 consensus binding site at a position 134 bp upstream of the transcription start site ( EL-Gazzar et al., 2001 ), suggesting that the signaling to activate PU.1-mediated transcription is asso-ciated with GANP function in B cell activation, as predicted in the Lyn-deficient DT40 B cell model ( Mirnics et al., 2004 ).145 AID-Associated Protein GANP4.2 GANP and AID GC formation was shown to occur in the absence of T cells in mice with trans- genic BCR of the quasi-monoclonal IgV region that recognizes NP (de Vinuesa et al., 2000 ), and the sporadic appearance of GCs in athymic mice (Stedra & Cerny, 1994 ) indicated that T cell costimulatory signaling is not mandatory for GC formation. However, the Ab responses of B cells were found to be augmented by helper T cell interaction through CD40 - CD40L for the proliferation of Ag-specific B cells, increased SHM andCSR, and affinity maturation. Recently, it has also been shown that GC-likeB cells can be maintained for the long term in experiments with IL-2 andfibroblast feeder cells expressing CD40L and BAFF (B cell-activating factor, belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family) ( Kitabatake et al., 2015; Nojima et al., 2011 ). This in vitro culture system can support GC B cell proliferation with the expression of the GC-associated transcription factors AID, IRF4,and BCL6, presumably for GC formation; however, it cannot support the generation of IgV region SHM for Ab affinity maturation. AID seemed to require additional accessory molecules to induce efficient IgV region SHM, so attempts have been made to characterize AID-associatedproteins in many laboratories ( Table 1 ). GANP was shown to associate phys- ically with AID ( Maeda et al., 2010 ). Various kinds of GANP mutants were shown to associate similarly with AID (unpublished data) and such inter-action was found to be independent of the presence or absence of DNA orRNA in immunoprecipitation experiments; thus, no specific interaction domain has been determined so far. AID possesses several acidic motifs, con- taining glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues, on the turns of thepeptide chains between helices and -sheets. GANP also has various basic motifs with arginine (R) and lysine (K) residues. We speculated that the phys-ical interaction between them occurs through the attractive force generated by their opposite charges. AID has six negatively charged residues (D 37SAT, D67WD and AID mutants with substitution of each of these amino acid residuesshowed altered association with GANP. In an AID mutant with the substitu- tion D143A (Asp143 to Ala), the association between AID and GANP was critically impaired. These results indicate that GANP forms a complex withAID and the RNAs in cells, presumably through a charge-mediated mecha-nism in the presence of various accessory components.146 N. Sakaguchi and K. MaedaTable 1 AID-Interacting Proteins Category Genes Transcription units RNA polymerase PAF GANP4.3 Nuclear Translocation of AID AID contains a nuclear localization signal, but is highly acidic and is normally localized in the cytoplasm. For AID to target an Ig gene, it must be localized at least transiently in the nucleus. Many laboratories speculated that accessorymolecules are required for AID shuttling between the cytoplasm and thenucleus in B cells. Alternatively, AID might enter the nucleus along with nuclear breakdown in the mitotic phase, when the nuclear envelope is tem- porarily dispersed. During reassembly of the nuclear envelope, a few copiesof AID would remain in the nucleus and access the IgV region chromatin ina transcription-competent state. By cotransfection experiments in COS7cells, AID(wt) fused with red fluorescent protein (DsRed) was found to be exclusively localized in the cytoplasm as reported previously ( Ito et al., 2004; and AID(wt)- DsRed was shown to comigrate into the nucleus upon cotransfection with the fusion protein green fluorescent protein (GFP)-GANP. Mutant AIDD143A, however, never appeared in the nucleus and remained separately in the cells, as AID(wt)-DsRed in the cytoplasm and GFP-GANP in thenucleus. These results demonstrate that GANP is involved in the machinery that escorts AID to the nucleus. 4.4 Targeting of AID to the Rearranged IgV Region The AID/GANP complex is recruited selectively to the site of the rearranged IgV region locus through the action of the histoneacetyltransferase (HAT) domain of GANP ( Singh et al., 2013 ). The HAT domain (amino acids 1648 -1783) has the ability to acetylate histones H1 and which loosens the chromosome to form oligo- or monochromatin. The rearranged IgVregion is grasped tightly at the two independent sites of the 5 0-end of the V region exon (first site) and the tail end of the rearranged IgV region (second site), maintaining the basic IgV region chromosome structure that is resistantto Mung Bean Nuclease (MNase) treatment, while almost the entire IgVregion is loosened for active transcription in mature B cells ( Kodgire, Mukkawar, North, Poirier, & Storb, 2012 ). The HAT activity of GANP involves selective acetylation at the second MNase-resistant site, which relaxesthe chromatin structure, allowing access of the AID/GANP complex. WhenHAT activity is lacking, the chromatin structure cannot be efficiently released. The initial histone acetylation is followed by the successive alteration of histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9) and Lys 27 (H3K27) over the entire rearranged148 N. Sakaguchi and K. MaedaIgV region locus. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed the access of GANP to the second MNase-resistant site in the rearranged IgV region, together with the stalling factor Spt5 (transcription elongation fac- tor) and the insulator CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor). Moreover, GANP augments the access of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pSer5 (as a transcription initiation phosphorylated form) and pSer2 (as a transcription elongation form). Eventually, access of the AID/GANP complex to the rearranged IgV region locus is facilitated, increasing the mutation frequency. A schematic model of the access of AID/GANP to the rearranged IgV region is shown in Fig. 1 . Collectively, GANP-mediated chromatin modification promotes the recruit- ment of the transcription complex and positioning at the IgV region loci, which facilitates AID targeting. 4.5 Role of GANP in Ab Affinity Maturation The expression of GANP is not restricted to the B cells in GCs; it is also expressed and plays a critical role in early embryos, as evidenced by the embryonic lethality of GANP-null mutant mice ( Yoshida et al., 2007 ). Despite its ubiquitous expression, the upregulation of GANP protein and Histone acetylation the AID/GANP complex to the rearranged IgV region in B cells. The AID/GANP complex is recruited to the selective site of the rearranged IgV region gene through the action of HAT actively of GANP, acetylating H3K9, H3K27, and H1K63, con- sequently releasing AID to the R-loop during the active transcription with the initiation (S5P: phosphorylated at Ser5) and the elongation (S2P: phosphorylated at petent Pol II. The AID effectively induces IgV SHM during the transcription stalling with Spt5.149 AID-Associated Protein GANPits association with AID interaction in GC B cells during responses to TD-Ags suggest the significant role of GANP in immune reactions (Maeda et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2013 ). 4.5.1 GANP Conditional Knockout Mice GANP-null mutant (Ganp/C0//C0) mice were shown to die at the embryo stage (on day 11) with their vessels displaying a fragile endothelial layer, along withmassive hemorrhaging from the liver, aorta, and heart (unpublished data).Ganp /C0//C0mice also displayed abnormalities in the brain, with enlarged third ventricles and a thinner cortex region. These findings indicated that GANP is essential for cell proliferation at the stage of organ formation during earlydevelopment ( Yoshida et al., 2007 ). The first attempt to investigate the physiological function of GANP was performed by the conditional targeting of the ganpgene in B cells using the floxed ganp (GanpF/F) gene between exon CD19-Cre/ GanpF/Fmice were born, they appeared to be normal and showed normal Ab responses, with various isotype s against T-cell-independent Ag ( Kuwahara et al., 2004 ) .T h e s em i c ea l s os h o w e dl e v e l so fs e r u mA b so ft h eI g M ,I g G 1 , IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 classes equivalent to those in the floxed control miceafter immunization with TD-Ag NP-CG G under alum adjuvant immuniza- tion in an earlier inspect ion; however, B cells in CD19-Cre/Ganp F/Fimpaired the affinity maturation against NP-hap ten, as measured by differential ELISA and the typical high-affi n i t y - t y p eW 3 3 L( T r p 3 3t oL e u )m u t a t i o nf r e q u e n c y of IgV H186.2. CD19-Cre/GanpF/Fmice displayed a significant delay in GC formation in the spleen and a marked decrease of 4-hydroxy- 5-iodo-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NIP)-binding CD38+IgG1+B cells compared with the floxed control mice. The mutant mice also showed the increasedapoptosis of GC B cells with relatively low bcl-2expression upon stimulation. 4.5.2 B Cell GANP Transgenic Mice To further investigate the contribution of GANP expression to the affinitymaturation of Abs against TD-Ags, we created transgenic mice that over- express mouse ganp cDNA under the control of Ig promoter and enhancer regions ( Ganp Tgmice)( Sakaguchi et TD-Ags such as NL41 peptidecorresponding to the V3 stretch of HIV-1 gp120, and various kinds of Ags. Biacore analysis demonstrated that several mAbs established from Ganp Tgmice yielded 10- to 50-fold higher affinities against the NL41150 N. Sakaguchi and K. Maedapeptides than those from the hybridomas of C57BL/6 mice. The effective- ness of GanpTgmice was further confirmed by mAbs studies for various clin- ical applications. The GanpTgmice were particularly effective against the epitopes of protein modification for cancer markers such as cancer-specificsugar epitope of Muc5A protein appearing in cholangiocarcinoma( Silsirivanit of serum -fibrinogen ( Ono et al., 2009 ). These results suggested that GANP is associated with the generation of high-affinity Abs against TD-Ags, even though IgV region SHM and GC forma-tion were modestly affected by the 50% increase in GANP expression in B cells. 4.5.3 GANP in Lyn-Deficient Mice The involvement of GANP in GC formation and the generation of IgVregion SHM was further studied using Lyn-deficient mice. Lyn deficiency is associated with the impairment of GC formation ( Hibbs et al., 1995; Nishizumi et al., 1995 ). GANP expression was shown to be regulated by Lyn-mediated signaling in DT40 B cells ( Mirnics et al., 2004 ). Thus, the role of GANP as a Lyn-signaling downstream event was examined by breeding GanpTgmouse with Lyn/C0//C0mouse. GanpTgLyn/C0//C0mice could not recover or affect the impairment of GC formation compared with Lyn/C0//C0mice (Kuwahara et al., 2012 ); however, IgV region SHM was increased in GC B cells upon immunization with NP-CGG. The IgV region SHM could occur in the absence of mature GC formation when GANP expression was increased to a level equivalent to that in GC B cells. These results indi-cate that IgV region SHM could occur outside of the GC area in theparafollicular region with the increase of CD11c +dendritic cells. Collec- tively, these observations provide evidence that GANP expression in GC B cells is indeed involved in the affinity maturation of Ag-specific B cellsin vivo. 5. STRUCTURE OF GANP Numerous findings that reveal the immune function of GANP have been reported, as described earlier, but the molecular mechanisms involved,besides their promoting AID targeting of the rearranged IgV region of the genome, remained unclear. To clarify the mechanistic role of GANP, it is necessary to understand the structure of GANP.151 AID-Associated Protein GANP5.1Ganp Gene Organization Theganp(MCM3AP in human) gene encodes at least six variant transcripts and is located on human chromosome 21 (chr21: 46,235,126 -46,285,394, complement), being mapped of the long arm at 21q22.3. It encodes 28 exonsfor the full-length functional GANP protein. FANM-V data Browser Human Dec. 2013 (GRCh37/hg38) demon- strated the sense strand transcripts starting from the 5 0-UTR region as the full-length transcript. The ganpgene locus is surrounded by the YBEY 2,3-oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase) gene at the 30side. Two additional kinds of antisense transcripts are starting from the middle of the ganpgene locus. Layered H3K27Ac (acetylation) analysis shows two strongly peak signals at the both sides of ganp genome. The middle region of ganp genome locus is also detected H3K27Ac, which is closely related to the tran-scription start site of antisense ganpmRNA. Interestingly, another antisense RNA (MCM3AP-AS) transcripts are also located in the ganplocus at the 3 0 side and use the same antisense exons (exon 20, 26) of ganpgene. The ChIP assay identified the interaction sites in a member of the terpene cyclase/mutase family, catalyzes the first step in the biosyn- thesis of cholesterol, steroid hormones, and vitamin D. The LSS gene is thought to be regulated by p53, Pax-3, and Brachyury, but no reportsdescribing the increased expression of LSSin B cells or in cancer cells have been published. The gene at the 5 0side, putative YBEY ribonuclease has 167 amino acids, but the evidence for the protein detection is still miscellaneous (Uhlen et al., 2012 ), although the Gene Ontology results suggest that the biological process associated with the YBEY gene is rRNA processing, determined using the GenesLikeMe website ( http://genecards.weizmann. ac.il/v3/index.php?path \u00bc/GenesLikeMe ). 5.2 A of Ganp Transcript In 1998, Takei and Tsujimoto identified a protein that interacts to the human minichromosome maintenance protein (MCM) 3 by yeast two- hybrid screening ( Takei & Tsujimoto, 1998 ). It was predicted to encode an 80-kDa protein, named as MCM3-associated protein, MAP80. They152 N. Sakaguchi and K. Maedademonstrated that MAP80 is associated with MCM3, a component of the MCM complex with DNA helicase activity. The short-form putative pro- tein MAP80 has a region homologous to the domain of HAT molecules( Takei et al., 2001; Wickramasinghe et al., 2011 ). These structural protein interactions led to the prediction that GANP might be an accessory mole-cule for DNA replication in rapidly proliferating cells, such as Ag-driven B cells and highly proliferating malignant cells. 5.3 Structure of GANP Protein The full-length 6-kb transcript from the same GANP/MAP80 locus was shown to encode a 210-kDa nuclear protein in B cells that are activatedand rapidly proliferating at the GCs of the peripheral lymphoid organs uponimmunization with TD-Ag, SRBC ( Kuwahara et al., 2000 ). In a subsequent study, the short-form transcript of the GANP/MAP80 locus could not be identified sufficiently in human B cells by Northern blot analysis ( Abe et al., 2000 ). Western blot analysis with specific Abs against GANP did not show a protein of a size corresponding to MAP80 in B cells, suggesting that the short-form MAP80 is expressed far less than the full-length GANP protein in mice and humans. Therefore, in this review, we focus on thestructure of the full-length GANP protein. 5.4 FG-Rich Domain The N-terminal domain of GANP in the region from amino acid 1 to 400shows some differences among the mammalians. GANP has the typical FG(Phe-Gly)-rich amino acid sequence in humans, mice, rats, rabbits, cows, and sheep, in contrast to the proteins homologous to Sac3 in lower eukary- otes, which lack such structures. The family of proteins with FG-repeatregions function as components of the nuclear envelope, as shown in Fig. 2 , suggesting that GANP has properties similar to those of nuclear pore complex (NPC) components. 5.5 RNA Recognition Motif The N-terminal side region of GANP contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM). GANP is involved in the mRNA export of shugoshin-1 , which is required for centromere cohesion and in sister-chromatid exchange( Okamoto et al., 2010 ). Knockdown of GANP with siRNA induces cell- cycle arrest at the G2/M-phase and causes abnormal chromosome alignment at the metaphase. PCID2, other TREX-2 components, also selectively153 AID-Associated Protein GANPregulates the export of Mad2 mRNA, but not of the other cell-cycle- associated genes encoding MAD1, BUBR1, cyclin Nakaya et al., 2010 ). This RRM may be contributed with Sac3-homology region. 5.6 Sac3-Homology Domain In mice and humans, another gene homologous to S. cerevisiae Sac3 was identified and designated as -910 amino acids of GANP corresponds to almost the whole of the SHD1 pro- tein, namely, the region between amino acids 70 -425 of the 425 amino acids of the mouse SHD1 protein ( Khuda et al., 2004 ). SHD1 is necessary for cell division, especially in centrosome duplication, the spindle assembly check- point from metaphase to anaphase, and spindle formation. Mad2 expression was shown to be affected by a lack of SHD1, indicating the functional involvement of the Sac3-homology Nuclear faceNuclear envelope Nup153Transmembrane Fig. 2 Nuclear pore complex (NPC) of mammalian cells. NPC is perforating the nuclear envelope with transmembrane pipe structure composed of Nup62 complex, Nup106 complex, Nup93 complex, Nup98, RAE1, and the other components toward the cyto- plasmic projecting the cytoplasmic tail with RanBP2/Nup358, Nup214, Nup12/ CG1, and Nup88. Toward nuclear face, the NPC involves Pom121, gp210, and Ndc1, for nuclear face with Nup50, Nup153, and TPR, creating the basket-like structure to accept the mRNPs interacting with TREX and TREX-2. The FG-rich region contain- ing molecules play important roles for the assembly of NPC and the mRNA export.154 N. Sakaguchi and K. Maedaregulation through regulation of the anaphase-promoting complex-Cdc20 suppressing Pds1 activation and blocking cell division ( Yu, 2002 ). GANP might possess a similar function in B cells. 5.7 Histone Acetyltransferase Region The C-terminal region of GANP (amino acids 1648 -1783 in mouse) includes a HAT activity domain ( Singh et al., 2013; Takei et al., 2001 ) that effectively catalyzes the acetylation of histone H1, which is different fromthe other HAT complex of SAGA that targets H2A/H2B and H3. HistoneH1 is the fifth nucleosome-binding protein, following H2B, H3, and H4, and is positioned in doublets around a segment of which two turns of DNA are attached. A recent study also suggested the role of H1 in theresponse to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through ( Thorslund et al., 2015 ). H1 is known to play roles in tight chromatin folding and thus in gene regulation. It has three domains: the H1 global domain, which interacts with nucleosomal DNA, the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, which interact with the phosphatebackbone of the linker DNA, and the N-terminal tails of the core histones.Acetylation alters the capacity of H1 to loosen the compact higher-order structure of the chromosome and generates the active gene-rich chromatin, and may also be involved in DNA repair after the targeting of AID to the IgVregion of the genome. 5.8 MCM3-Interacting Region Mammalian GANP is homologous to ySac3 in the central portion desig-nated the Sac3-homology region (between amino acids 686 and 910), withsimilarity of 25%, but carries an additional unique region at the C-terminalend, most of which overlaps with the HAT region ( Sakaguchi, Maeda, & Kuwahara, 2011 ). This region was identified as MAP80, a protein that inter- acts with MCM3 ( Takei & Tsujimoto, 1998 ), a component helicase complex of MCM2 -7(Tye, 1999 ). The MCM complex is known to be involved in genome replication by interacting with DNA Pol for DNA synthesis from the origin of replication center (ORC) in both direc- tions, as the leading strand and the lagging strand, with the help ofoligoribonucleotide chains creating Okazaki fragments. In eukaryotes, theORC binds DNA replication origins and loads two MCM2 -7 single hexamers through interactions et al., 2009; Remus 2009 activation of the -7 complex takes place155 AID-Associated Protein GANPat the S-phase via the involvement of several factors and cell-cycle-specific kinases. Initially, experimental results suggested the proximity of the func- tional interaction and colocalization of GANP with the MCM -DNA rep- lication complex, but further studies failed to clarify the role of thisinteraction in the S-phase. 6. GANP-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS Human and mouse GANPs have unique structures at the N-terminal and C-terminal regions compared with ySac3. Proteomic screening of human GANP-associated proteins using Abs for either its N-terminal orits C-terminal region showed unique molecules in each sample ( Singh et al., 2013 ). The proteins that commonly appeared in both precipitates from human Ramos B cell nuclear extract were mostly involved in RNA pro- cessing and splicing, as well as the nuclear envelope, as listed in Table 2 . Supporting the assertion that GANP is a component of TREX-2, it strongly Table 2 GANP-Interacting Proteins Techniques mouse GANP from 3844 to 5757 nt (2002) . cIgarashi et al. (2009) .156 N. Sakaguchi DNA repair molecules (DNA-PKcs and Top2 ), implying the unique function of GANP in RNA processing and nuclearexport in B cells. 6.1 RNA Export Complex From studies of S. cerevisiae , we have learned that mRNAs move from their site of transcription in chromatin toward the nuclear envelope and then through the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm ( Abruzzi, Lacadie, transcription is undertaken upon the recruitment of Pol II; the subsequently produced nascent transcripts gather together the mRNA- coating factors yTHO and yTREX and with the mRNP-coating factors and yTREX-2complex to interact with the nuclear basket for nuclear translocation through the mRNA surveillance mechanism. After confirming the integrity of mRNPs and transportation into the cytoplasm, the mRNAs are released fromthe assembly by the action of yDEAD box protein 5 and yGle1 colocalizedwith nucleoproteins yNup42 and yNup159. All of these complexes are also composed of various subcomponents, together with the possible mammalian counterparts. 6.2 SAGA Complex and TREX-2 Complex To achieve optimal gene activation in the chromatin, ofH2B is ySAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5- Acetyltransferase) chromatin-remodeling complex binds to the promoters of target genes and facilitates transcriptional activation through histone acet-ylation and/or deubiquitination with two Dent, 2010; Rodriguez-Navarro, complex, demonstrated in yeast and Drosophila models, facili- tates the local remodeling of chromatin and increases the accessibility for157 AID-Associated Protein GANPelongation machinery, allowing the interaction of mRNA export factors with yTREX-2, which anchors the mature mRNPs to the NPC. The export of mature spliced mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is mediated by various sets of accessory factors. Typically, the conserved nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) and its cofactor p15 are involved in the nuclear export of most mRNAs, while a class of endogenous mRNAs and viral genomic RNAs use chromosome region maintenance 1 protein homologue (CRM1, exportin-1, EXO1). The NPC and the export adap- tors have an FG-rich region and play important roles in the early stage of RNA biology as TREX and TREX-2 ( Fig. 3 ). Recent studies have revealed that mRNA export in mammalian cells is mediated not only by the bulk export pathway, but also through alternative mechanisms, particularly for the molecules involved in DNA repair, gene expression, cell proliferation, cell survival, and the maintenance of cell pluripotency ( Katahira, Inoue, Hurt, & et al., 2013; complex interacted with the SAGA complex. Mammalian SAGA complex is the chromatin-remodeling complex that binds to the promoters of target genes and facilitates transcriptional activation through histone acetylation and/or deubiquitination, of component of ATXN7L3 with ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) suggested the functional involvement of mam- malian TREX-2 in the regulation of global transcription elongation based on the studies of yTREX-2 homologues. Human designated as GANP -ENY2 -PCID2 -DSS1 - CETN2/CETN3, while the physical interaction of these components has been partially determined.158 N. Sakaguchi and K. MaedaMammalian TREX-2 is an as-yet functionally undetermined complex that appears as an interface of NPC and the transcription machinery inter- acting next to SAGA and the THO complex. Yeast TREX-2 consists ofySac3, yThp1, ySem1, ySus1, and yCdc31, as listed in Table 3 . The yTREX-2 complex has been thought to interact with the nascent transcriptsafter the initiation and elongation of RNA synthesis by Pol II. The processing of the primary RNA strand proceeds with splicing factors and the RNA-binding particle mRNP with a 5 0-cap, 30-poly(A) tail, and the protein coat of various export factors. The mRNP complex interacts withMediators as a direct yTREX-2 target establishing the communication between yTREX-2 and Pol II. The yThp1 is a prototype of the mammalian PCID2 protein with a unique domain called the PCI domain that interactswith the Sac3 PCI region (amino acids 200 -548) and also with ySem1 (the mammalian homologue of which is called DSS1). PCID2 plays a critical role in B cell survival and embryonic stem cell differentiation in mice ( Nakaya et al., 2010; Ye et al., 2014 ). It associates with EID1 in the form of the CBP/p300-EID1 complex and impedes the association with MDM2, thusinhibiting the deg- radation, thereby modulating the HAT activity of CBP/p300. Recent study showed that ySac3 also interacts with ySus1 and yCdc31 through the C-ter-minal side NPC anchor region (amino acids 723 -805) ( Schneider et al., 2015 ). According to this model, yTREX-2 is a component associated with the Mediator complex involved in mRNA transcription by interacting with Table 3 TREX-2 Complex Components Mammal Yeast TREX-2 ComponentsGene AID-Associated II and also plays a role in mRNA export by interacting with the NPC complex. The ySus1-mediated link of ySAGA and yTREX-2 is necessary at least for the selective transcription-coupled mRNA export ( Klockner et al., 2009 ); however, the mechanism for mRNA export in mammals remains unclear. 6.3 Nuclear Pore Most nascent transcripts are long precursor RNAs and only the processed functional RNAs are transported across the nuclear envelope through NPC. The nuclear envelope is composed of outer and inner nuclear mem-branes, both of which are spanned by the nuclear pores. The outer mem-brane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. Transcriptional regulators cross-link inner nuclear membrane proteins and chromatin, including E2F, Pol II, and RNA splicing complex. Sites of genes in thenuclear compartments are likely to be nonrandom localized in the nuclearlamina and the developmentally repressed genes ). According to the gene gat- ing hypothesis, the compact chromatin anchored to the nuclear membrane,but active chromatin associates with nuclear pores and allows the transportof mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ( Blobel, 1985 ). The overall structure of the nuclear pore is conserved between yeast and mammal, although it has different sizes: 66 MDa in yeast and 120 MDa in vertebrates (Alber et al., 2007a, 2007b ), involving a protein structure with eightfold symmetry, comprising the central transport channel and two rings, onetoward the cytoplasmic side projecting the free loose ends of filaments and the other to the nuclear side with the connected ends forming the nuclear basket. The NPC contains multiple copies of approximately 30 dif-ferent proteins named nucleoporins (Nups). The mammalian NPC is acylindrical pipe-like structure of approximately 145 nm in diameter and 80 nm in length, in contrast to the smaller size of the yeast NPC of approx- imately 96 nm in diameter and 35 nm in length. The NPC is composed ofeight proteins on the cytoplasmic surface, as embedded in the nuclear lam-ina, and a similar ring of eight on the inner surface of the nuclear mem- brane, positioned at the center of the NPC as a sphincter-like gate for the transportation of substances. The membrane-anchored proteins are160 N. Sakaguchi and K. Maedalikely connected to secondary components of specific fold types, the -propeller and -solenoid, as well as FG residues separated by polar spacers of Nups of various lengths. The NPC is known to be involved in mature mRNA metabolism in association with mRNA export by enhancing the coupling of 30-end processing of in The C-terminal region of Pol II is strongly involved in RNA transcription and processing through association with the moleculesthat perform 5 0-end capping, splicing, 30-end Pascual- Garcia et al., 2008 ). The interaction of SAGA -TREX-2 might support the gene -NPC link during the transcription elongation phase, which ensures high-fidelity processing of the transcripts and genomic stability dur-ing the high level transcription of specific genes in rapidly proliferating cells such as GC B cells. 6.4 Miscellaneous Proteins 6.4.1 Protein Phosphatase Subunit G5PR The proteins that interact with GANP were examined by yeast two-hybridscreening ( Kono et al., (FLJ20644, GenBank no. AK000651 ) shown to bind to a truncated version of GANP containing its middle portion (from 3844 to 5757 nt). This moleculenamed G5PR is a novel regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A(PP2A)(PPP2R3C), as a B 00subunit interacting with the catalytic subunit (PP2Ac). PP2A catalyzes a wide variety & In contrast to the various kinase molecules that have unique specificity, PP2Acis regulated to exhibit a wide spectrum of specificity with several B subunit components, such as B, B 0, and B00, as well as the other subunit 4(Inui et al., 1998 ). G5PR is ubiquitously expressed and associated with either PP2Ac or PP5 in various tissues including lymphoid cells. G5PR deficiency producedby conditional gene targeting in B cells was shown to be associated with the enhanced activation of JNK kinase and regulated the JNK-induced cell death signaling associated membrane phosphorylation of the apoptotic BH3 protein Bim ( Lei & Davis, 2003 ) as one of the critical targets of G5PR. The function of G5PR is rather restricted to signaling pathways involved in B cell161 AID-Associated Protein GANPactivation in GCs and also for T cell selection in the thymus ( Xing, Wang, Igarashi, Kawamoto, & Sakaguchi, 2008 ). The conditional targeting of G5PR in B cells was shown to enhance BCR-mediated activation-inducedcell death and markedly decrease the formation of GCs upon immunizationwith TD-Ag, SRBC ( Xing et al., 2005 ). G5PR deficiency, however, did not influence the BCR-mediated activation of ERKs and NF- B, cyclin D2 induction, or Akt activation. Conversely, transgenic G5PR overexpres- sion in B cells with the Ig promoter and enhancer regions, which nearly doubled G5PR expression, did not cause marked abnormality in the GCB cell reaction and without enhancing the affinity maturation against the immunized TD-Ags ( Kitabatake et al., 2015 ). G5PR overexpression in B lineage cells, however, was shown to be associated with an increase ofB1 cells in the peritoneal cavity upon aging with the development of auto-antibodies (autoAbs) of anti-ss and anti-ds DNAs spontaneously, similarly to the case in female New Zealand Black (NZB) and (NZB /C2New Zealand White [NZW]) F1 mice without Ag immunization. The B1 cells appearedin the GCs and interacted with the FDCs. These results suggested thatG5PR is involved in B cell selection at the GCs during immune responses. The dynamism of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation through PP2A covers many reactions, so it has remained unclear how the phosphorylationstate of the AID/GANP complex is affected by G5PR in immune responses.Apart from G5PR, GANP phosphorylation was detected at Ser502, which isclose to the RRM, potentially serving as a primer for DNA replication asso- ciated with the MCM complex ( Kuwahara et al., 2001 ). Ser502 is predicted to be a CDK target, suggesting that the phosphorylation reaction wouldoccur during cell-cycle progression in rapidly proliferating GC cells. 6.4.2 Arginine Methyltransferase PRMT5Another approach for identifying GANP-associated proteins found the interaction of the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT5) using a tan- dem affinity purification system with 293T cells transfected with ganpcDNA in a vector construct under the promoter pEF-BOS with a 3 /C2Flag-tag and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease/calmodulin-binding expression con- struct ( In this system, GANP interacts with PRMT5, which is associated with a 50-kDa WD (Trp and Asp) repeat protein calledmethylosome nine PRMTs, Gly- and Arg-rich (CAR) motifs in their substrates, but the substrates did not seem to be redun- dant. PRMT1 and PRMT5 are asymmetric and symmetric arginine162 N. Sakaguchi and K. Maedamethyltransferases, whose functions are not compatible with each other (Yang & Bedford, 2013 ). The primary targets of PRMT1 are H4R3, SAM68, which function repair. PRMT5 targetsH3R8, E2F1, p53, EGFR, and CRAF, signal transduction, and miRNA pathways ( Mallappa et al., 2011). PRMT5 is also associated with other molecules, such as Pol II, FCP1 phosphatase, and Blimp-1, although the details of their roles remain unclear( Amente et al., 2005; Ancelin et al., 2006 ).PRMT1 transcripts are ubiquitous, butPRMT5 was shown to be inducible by stimulation with lipopolysaccha- ride plus IL-4 in B cells in vitro and in GC B cells in vivo ( Igarashi et al., 2009 signaling causes the upregulation of STAT6-mediated transcriptionin GC B GANP downregulates the phosphorylation of STAT6 by suppressing PRMT5 function. This predicted model was con- firmed in vivo via evidence showing that the loss of GANP in B cells causedspontaneous hyper IgE in the serum. STAT6 activation is observed in theCSR to IgG1 and IgE, but the promoters for IgandIg1transcription might have different affinities to STAT6, as reported with a 10-fold difference in the electrophoresis mobility shift assay ( Mao & Stavnezer, 2001 ). GANP/ PRMT5 is functionally involved in the regulation of B cell activation in GCs,presumably minimizing the aberrant CSR to IgE production. 7. TRANSCRIPTION-COUPLED IgV REGION SHM 7.1 R-Loop During Ig switch region transcription, an RNA strand adheres to the tem- plate strand, but the nontemplate DNA strand remains free, inR-loop formation ( 1990; Reaban, Lebowitz, & Griffin, 1994; Roy, Yu, & Lieber, 2008 ). In the Ig switch region, the R-loop is initiated at a region with clusters ofGs on the nontemplate strand ( Roy & Lieber, 2009 ) and plays a role in the physiological DNA DSBs for Ig CSR. The assembly of the nascent RNA transcripts with mature mRNP biogenesis is maintained by the appro- priate formation of the multiprotein THO complex, which was originallyidentified in the S. cerevisiae ( Chavez et Jimeno, & ), allowing the recruitment of mRNA export factors. In the absence of yTHO,163 AID-Associated Protein GANPDNA:RNA hybrids accumulate and generate R-loop formation ( Gomez- Gonzalez et al., 2011 ), implying that the roles of R-loop formation can be regulated by the mRNP biogenesis TREX machinery including theyTHO complex at the hotspots recombination and genomicinstability Li & Manley, 2006 ). 7.2 Noncoding RNAs and Divergent Transcription Model of IgV region Locus Global run-on sequencing detects nascent transcripts generated at a large proportion of intergenic regions with a subset emanating from transcrip- tional enhancers ( Core, Waterfall, & 2008; Wang et al., 2011 ). Enhancers are cis-elements that can evoke transcription irrespective of ori- entation, either downstream or upstream of the gene ( Levine, Cattoglio, & Tjian, 2014 ); thus, the transcripts from both orientations as the sense and antisense RNAs can be divergent. The asymmetric and enriched allocation of transcription factors in the long genomic DNA element named the superenhancer (SE) causes hyperactivation by acetylation in the form ofH3K27Ac and methylation in the form of H3Kme1 and confers specialized activity of such bidirectional transcription ( Creyghton et al., 2010; Loven et al., 2013; Whyte et al., 2013 ). AID targets such SE by on-targeting and off-targeting simultaneously ( Chiarle et al., 2011; Klein et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2008; Pasqualucci et al., 2001 ). The convergent transcripts that arise from the antisense strand are a likely cause of DNA DSBs ( Meng et al., 2014 ). The off-target gene elements of such SE-associated converged transcripts have been implicated in B Myc, MIR142, CD95, B cell differentiation Muschen 1998; Tsai & Ho, 2008 ). Moreover, genome-wide analysis of the AID- targeting region clarified the selectivity in the genome sequence in therearranged IgV region and switch region genes during the differentiation of B cells ( Yeap et al., 2015 ). 7.3 GANP and DNA Hyperrecombination The lack of ySac3 causes mild alteration in the yeast cell-cycle but alters DNA repair of transcription-coupled DNA damage, showing the DNA164 N. Sakaguchi and K. Maedahyperrecombination measured by the assay ( Bauer & Kolling, 1996 ). ySac3 is associated with yThp1 and involved in the mRNP complex for mRNA export from the nucleus ( Fischer et al., 2002 ). The lack of ySac3 was shown to result in DNA hyperrecombination ( Gallardo et al., 2003 ). Similarly, GANP also resulted in DNA hyperrecombination in the reporter assay of a tandem mutant LacZ0/LacZ00(-galactosidase) con- struct in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells that were ganp-heterodeficient (Yoshida et al., 2007 ). In contrast, overexpression of GANP markedly (>10-fold) suppressed the DNA hyperrecombination that was induced by introduction of the yeast endonuclease I-S ceI to cleave the construct between the LacZ0and LacZ00regions, producing artificial DNA DSBs; however, the effect did not significantly alter the RAG-mediated Ig generearrangement with recombination signal sequence sites. The details ofthe molecular mechanism behind the inhibition of DNA hyperrecombi- nation remain unclear. One possible explanation is a deficiency of RNA transportation because the effect of mRNA export is restricted to the genesthat are actively transcribed. The suppression of DNA hyperrecombinationis marked with the DpnI-treated reporter DNA. The massive accumulation of nascent RNA transcripts before RNA splicing and assembly into the mRNP complex that has complete sequence complementarity to the tem-plate strand DNA causes collision stress in the supercoil winding motion,consequently generating DNA DSBs in a transcription-coupled manner. GC B cells displayed IgV region DSBs with ( Bross et al., 2000; Papavasiliou & al., 2003 ). The asso- ciation of the IgV region DSBs and the rate of AID-mediated SHM have beenissues of debate, while AID might affect region SHM eventsbefore or 2002; Papavasiliou Schatz, 2002 ). We explored the effect of GANP on the fre- quency of IgV region DSBs ligation-mediated PCR The IgV H186.2 region DSBs was increased in GC B cells of GanpTgmice upon immunization with NP-CGG. GANP was shown to play a role in suppressing DNA hyperrecombination in the LacZ0-LacZ00tandem repeat DNA recombination assay ( Yoshida et al., 2007), similarly to ySac3 and other yTREX-2 components in the yeast sys- tem. Further studies showed the role of GANP in regulation of the DNArepair pathway after treatment with the DNA-damage-inducing agents etoposide (a II inhibitor) etoposide-induced (Katsube et al., 2011 ). In contrast, GANP augmented the repair of DNA dam- age induced by camptothecin, which is exclusively repaired by homologousrecombination ( E i de ta l . ,2 0 1 4 ). GANP physically associates with DNA-PKcs, and etoposide- or AID-induced DNA damage rapidly causes the release ofDNA-PKcs from the GANP complex independently of ATM or DNA-PKcs kinase activity. Thus, GANP might prov i d eas t a t eo fl e s sD N A - P K c si n v o l v e - ment at genomic regions with DNA DSBs, which presumably facilitates thechoice of DNA homologous recombination pathway. GANP chooses thehomologous recombination pathway th at repairs the genome at high fidelity without rigorous DNA breaks, rearrang ements, or chromosome transloca- tions, promoting the maintenance of genomic integrity at the sites of DNADSBs. In fact, in the chicken DT40 B cell clone lacking the pseudo-V -light chain genes, which can be used to cle arly demonstrate the frequency of AID-induced IgV region SHM in vitro, GANP overexpression markedly augmented the SHM frequency in the V light chain gene and the heter- odeficiency of GANP significantly reduced the SHM frequency. 7.4 Summary of Current Knowledge on GANP for B Cells In mammalian cells, GANP exerts multiple functions by interacting with many different nuclear proteins, most likely for RNA biogenesis, from the release of chromatin for initial transcription at the locus interacted with SAGAcomplex and the assembly of mRNP with various factors for the efficientexport of mRNA through the NPC to its presentation to the translation appa-ratus. At present, GANP is considered to be a component of mammalian TREX-2 interacting to the SAGA complex and the mRNPs ( Fig. 4 ). The structure of the GANP protein seems to have undergone substantial evolu-tionary development by attaching to the N-terminal FG-rich region,RRM, and the HAT region interacting with the MCM complex. This evo- lutionary development of the molecular structure presumably occurred because of the need to adapt to (1) the diversification of RNA molecules suchas coding and noncoding transcripts in mammalian cells from the simplesteukaryotic cells of S. cerevisiae , (2) the selective transport of transcripts, (3) the size difference of NPC for the import and export of substances, (4) retro- viral threats, and (5) the development of the AID/APOBEC cytidine deam-inase family, particularly in humans, as well as (6) to protect the genome fromvarious genotoxic stresses. The GANP -AID/APOBEC interaction at the NPC might be particularly important for immune cells that are highly special- ized at dealing with stresses to maintain host homeostasis.166 N. Sakaguchi and K. Maeda8. TREX-2 AND DISEASES TREX-2 is a complex that is assumed to be involved in RNA metab- olism from initial transcription until the cytoplasmic translation process. Adequate processing and export are now known to be critical for cellular metabolism and genomic integrity, and thus for the long life of human beings. Numerous genetic changes associated with various human diseases have now been reported, which should eventually lead to a novel paradigm regarding the etiology of human disorders associated with RNA metabo- lism, including the alterations of microRNAs and noncoding RNAs. 8.1 HIV-1 Infection and GANP APOBEC3 (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) proteins primarily target retroviral cDNA in the cytoplasm to cause hypermutation in viral genomes. APOBEC3G (A3G) exhibits antiretroviral activity that potentially restricts HIV-1 replication in T cells. A3G is mostly degraded by the viral infectivity factor (Vif ) that inhibits A3G & Malim, 2002; Zhang, Du, Evans, Yu, & Yu, 2012 ). However, Vif cannot completely degrade A3G and a few copies of A3G molecules that escape it are encapsidated into virions SAGA complex RNA polymerase A model of transcription and mRNA export in mammals. After the initial interac- tion of the SAGA complex, RNA Pol II is recruited to the transcription-competent chro- matin, and the nascent transcript is assembled with THO -TREX complex, mRNA export factors, mRNA-coating factors including splicing factors and RNA helicases, thus creat- ing the mRNPs. TREX-2 interacts with the SAGA complex through the component for the mRNA transport toward the NPC.167 AID-Associated Protein GANP(Browne, Allers, & Landau, 2009 ), presumably through the interaction of various host components and cellular factors ( Didierlaurent 2008 ). Since GANP is likely to associate with most of the APOBEC family cytidine deaminases, its role in HIV-1 infec-tion has been studied ( Maeda et al., 2013 ). GANP is also upregulated coor- dinately with A3G cells that are activated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and IL-2 in vitro. AID and GANP directly interact with viralcomponents through different regions: A3G to the nuclear capsid, butGANP to a more extended region covering the matrix and capsid proteins. The increased expression of GANP recruits A3G efficiently into the virion core region, facilitating the interaction of A3G and GANP with viral geno-mic RNAs GANP enhances A3G encapsidation into the virion core, where only two copies exist together with 7SL RNA, which instead decreases the incorporation of other cellular RNAs such as U1, U2, U4, and U5 that are snRNAs with a cap structure. As shown by an in vitroassay, GANP enhanced the rate of A3G-mediated G !A mutation by 80% and caused an increased proportion of G !A mutations, which eventually decreased the retroviral infectivity of the HIV-1 virus in a secondary infec- tion assay. These results demonstrate that the cellular component GANPplays a role in host defense as a general accessory molecule of AID/APOBEC proteins. 8.2 Autoimmunity GANP expression was examined in the B cells of various autoimmunity- prone mice with aging. Immunohistochemical analysis of the spleen fol- licular region showed high levels of GANP-positive cells in the red pulp(RP) region (parafollicular area) in aged autoimmunity-prone BXSB et al., 2005 ). Other mice, BXSB and NOD, also showed GANPhicells in the RP region, although the number of positive cells was lower. C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice did notdisplay such an increase under nonimm unized conditions. The increase of GANP hicells in the RP region appeared upon aging, and their frequency was correlated with the increase of se rum autoantibody (autoAb) titers. have 1/C0,T D 2 3/C0,a n dP N A/C0.T h e s er e s u l t sm i g h ti n d i - cate that plasmablasts or plasma cells express GANP at a higher level in animals that are autoimmune. The autoAb evolution via SHM occurred outside GCs at border Euler, Sakaguchi and K. MaedaThe aberrantly high GANP expression in late B cell differentiation nearly at the plasma cell stage might be pathological ly associated with autoAb production. GANP might assist the diversification of the IgV region repertoire towardautoAb production in the extrafollicul ar RP region, where strict selection to reduce the number of autoreactive B cell clones may not be undertaken.Thus, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanism by which GANP is upregulated in B lineage cells outside of GCs and to characterize whether the GANP hicells continuously undergo IgV region SHM. 8.3 Cancer The aberrant expression of AID has been observed not only in B lymphomacells ( Jankovic et al., 2013; Robbiani & Nussenzweig, 2013 ), but also in several human malignancies of hepatoma, colon carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and breast cancer. Moreover,APOBEC3B and APOBEC3A are critically associated with breast cancerdevelopment ( Burns et al., 2013; Nik-Zainal et al., et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2013; Xuan et al., 2013 ). Despite the accumulated evidence on the oncogenic role of AID/APOBEC family cytidine deami-nases, little is known about the function of the TREX-2 complex in cancerdevelopment, although its association with this disease has been reported ( Chan-On et al., 2009; Fujimura et al., 2012; Rezano et al., 2013 ). The lack of ySac3 is known to cause DNA hyperrecombination, but the molecularmechanism by which this is generated has yet to be elucidated. The collisiontheory with the triple strands involving of dsDNA and the complementary mRNA may partly explain the rigorous DNA changes, such as DNA hyperrecombination and chromosomal translocation. Recent advances inhigh-throughput sequencing technology have allowed the global study ofgene alteration. The concept of a transcription bubble transiently forming an RNA/DNA hybrid stretch as an R-loop during active transcription has been proposed. The R-loop is the primary site for the targeting ofAID cytidine deaminase that interacts with mRNA as strands.The TREX-2 component interacting with nascent mRNA would be the component most intimately interacting with the AID-targeting loci. Abnormal GANP expression has been observed in various highly malignant tumors. For example, brain tumor patients (101 cases of malignantglioblastoma) expressing low GANP were found to be associated with a worse prognosis. GANP locells are highly metastatic and are linked to loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 10, epidermal growth factor receptor169 AID-Associated Protein GANPgene amplification, and significantly poor prognosis compared GANPhiexpression ( Ohta et al., 2009 ). In hematopoietic tumors including myelodysplastic syndrome, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lympho-cytic leukemia, and Hodgkin's disease, high GANP expression wasexhibited in the bone marrow samples of clinical cases ( Fujimura et al., 2005 ). DSS1, another mammalian TREX-2 component, is known to inter- act with BRCA2 ( Marston et al., 1999; Yang et al., 2002 ) and can inhibit polyubiquitination by blocking access of ubiquitin ligase to BRCA2 in yeast( Funakoshi, Li, Velichutina, Hochstrasser, & Kobayashi, 2004 ). In a cohort analysis of breast cancer patients, DSS1hiexpression was associated with a worse prognosis because of the high rate of malignancy linked to the multidrug resistance ( Rezano et al., 2013 ), which could be explained by the resistance of tumor cells to anticancer drugs that damage DNA. Theseresults suggest that the expression of TREX-2 is involved in the mainte- nance of genomic stability. The lack or impairment of TREX-2 component might be a cause of cancer in an oncogenic state. 9. PERSPECTIVES This chapter has described the interaction of the mRNA export complex, TREX-2, in the metabolism of various cells. Advances in next- generation sequencing strategies have provided further insights regarding the global regulation of gene transcripts in mammalian cells. The diverseexpression of many different transcripts needs to be processed by the cargocomplex and/or the various molecules for appropriate translation and decay. The dynamic metabolism of mRNA molecules might be orchestrated so that the host genome does not become harmful or is properly repaired overthe lifespan. Studying GANP as a key platform for the TREX-2 mRNAexport should produce a new paradigm on regulation of the RNA metab-olism of immune cells and cells at early developmental stages.

Whole-body measurements track the probe accumulation providing a meansto measure biological changes such as metabolism, cell location, or tumor burden.PET can also be applied to both preclinical and clinical studies providing three-dimensional information. For immunotherapies (in particular understanding T cellresponses), PET can be utilized for spatial and longitudinal tracking of T lymphocytes. Although PET has been utilized clinically for over 30 years, the recent development of additional PET radiotracers have dramatically expanded the use of PET to detectendogenous or adoptively transferred T cells in vivo. Novel probes have identifiedchanges in T cell quantity, location, and function. This has enabled investigators to trackT cells outside of the circulation and in hematopoietic organs such as spleen, lymphnodes, and bone marrow, or within tumors. In this review, we cover advances in PETdetection of the antitumor T cell response and areas of focus for future studies. 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 T Cells as a Cancer Therapy For decades apparent cases of sporadic tumor regression and elimination have been documented in mice and humans. These studies formed the foun-dation of the concept that tumors could be immunogenic and recognizedby the immune system ( Rosenberg, 2001 ). In tumors such as melanoma and sarcoma, this has been attributed to antitumor T cells ( Rosenberg & Restifo, 2015 ). Tumor clearance occurs when the immune system recog- nizes the tumor via T cells reactive to immunogenic epitopes. A rapidexpansion and infiltration of T cells into tumors occur, resulting in tumor reduction and/or removal. These rare but encouraging results have led investigators to develop additional immunotherapies that aid in tumor188 M.N. McCracken et al.cell recognition Sharma & Allison, 2015b ). Immunotherapies can be broadly grouped into three major categories: (1) antibodies and cytokines, (2) vaccines, and (3) cell-based therapies. Eachtherapy aims to activate, prime, expand, or increase tumor recognition byT cells through different mechanisms. Early work focused on high-dose cytokine therapy (interleukin-2, IL-2) to expand all T cells in vivo ( Rosenberg, 2014 ). In clinical applications as a mon- otherapy, high-dose IL-2 had response rates of approximately 23% in renal cellcarcinoma ( Rosenberg, 2014 ). The successful but limited efficacy led to the development of alternative and complementary therapies ( Sharma & Allison, 2015a ). The next generation of immunotherapies in development are more T cell-specific antibodies that anti-PD-L1 antibodies directly target T cell inhibition in vivo and have demonstrated clin-ical response rates of up to 52% as a monotherapy in patients receiving thehighest dose (Hamid et al., 2013). In parallel with this influx of new antitumor immunotherapies, there is a pressing need for methods that can monitor sys- temic changes in endogenous T cells (see Sections 3 and 5 ). In the case of cell-based immunotherapies including vaccines or adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)or engineered T cells (T cell receptor\u2014TCR, or chimeric antigen receptor\u2014CAR), robust methods are needed to monitor these cells specif- ically posttransplant. Although cell-based therapies are highly efficacious,they can have unforeseen mortality due to on-target/off-tumor effects( Bendle et al., 2010 ). In one instance, a patient receiving an anti-HER2 CAR therapy died due to low Her2 expression within the lungs ( Morgan et al., 2010 ). Methods described in Sections 2 and 4 address ways that positron- emission tomography (PET) can monitor adoptively transferred cells. With the increased development and utilization of immunotherapies for treating cancer, it is critical to be able to identify the antitumor T cell response and off-target effects. Advances in imaging will provide a comple-mentary tool for clinicians and researchers to understand how newlydeveloped therapies work systemically. 1.2 Current Methods Used to Track Antitumor T Cell Response Conventional methods used to monitor the immune system can be limitedand biased. T cell responses are monitored most often through peripheral189 PET Detection of T Cell Responsesblood analysis and biopsy when appropriate. Blood measurements are the easiest and most robust method, providing information on cytokines, cell subsets, total cell quantity, and an easy method to track T cells in the periph-ery. However, blood sampling is limited by an inability to assess the T cellcomposition in alternative organs and tissues. Occasionally, a biopsy can becollected to allow for intratumoral (or alternative organ) examination. The advantage of biopsied tissue includes high spatial resolution (in 2D) to deter- mine T cell location within the tumor. The drawback to biopsies includesthe invasive procedure, inherent sampling error from heterogeneous tumorimmune microenvironment, and being limited to a single static time point. Furthermore, following fixation and further processing, functional informa- tion can be lost. Together these methods provide information on the state ofthe immune system at one time point and are limited in evaluating theimmune system across the whole body. This poses a clinical challenge for current cancer immunotherapies. Success of therapies frequently depends on the expansion and infiltration of antitumor cells, but there are currentlylimited methods to track this process. In some instances, an additional lim-itation is the inability to detect the on-target/off-tumor cellular cytotoxicity of the infused therapeutic cell product prior to complications, or to deter- mine the quantity of successful tumor-infiltrating cells without biopsy( Park, Rosenberg, & Morgan, 2011 ). Therefore, a noninvasive, whole-body imaging technique to monitor immune cell function can complement andimprove the current sampling methods ( Hildebrandt & Gambhir, 2004; Gambhir, & Grimm, 2011; Wolchok et al., 2009 ). Imaging technologies providing anatomical information such as X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) areused routinely as diagnostics but have had limited applications in tracking T cells specifically. The assessment of immunotherapeutic response using anatomical imaging and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors relieson the reduction of tumor volume, although there are known flaws in thesemethods ( Wolchok et al., 2009 ). To date, most clinical imaging of immune responses has been based on either PET or single-photon emission com- puted tomography (SPECT) Kircher et al., 2011 ). Most preclinical studies have utilized alternative imaging strat- egies that are restricted to small animals such as two-photon microscopy,fluorescent, and bioluminescent imaging or have adapted clinical modalities (SPECT, PET, CT, and MRI) as methods for measuring changes in the immune system ( Cherry & Gambhir, 2001; Hildebrandt & Gambhir, 2004 ). Each technology provides unique information with inherent190 M.N. McCracken et al.advantages and disadvantages, but this review will focus on PET imaging of the antitumor T cell response. One advantage of PET is that technologies developed preclinically can be applied directly to clinical problems, allowingfor imaging agents to transition quickly from bench-top to bedside( Phelps, 2000 ). 1.3 Utility of PET Imaging for Tracking and Analyzing T Cell Populations T cell development and maintenance are complicated with cells residing in almost all organs (reviewed in Farber, Yudanin, & Restifo, 2014 ). Simpli- fied, T cells are differentiated, activated, and exert effector function in dif- ferent tissues with the possibility of homing or residing in additional locations. T cell precursors (pro-T cells) arise in the bone marrow, and thenhome to the thymus to undergo thymic selection prior to cells entering theperiphery. Na \u00a8ve T cells then need to be activated by TCR engagement with peptide-loaded major histocompatibility (MHC) and costimulation from antigen presenting cells. This activation typically occurs within sec-ondary lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes. Proinflammatory cytokinesthen signal for T cells to traffic to the tumor for effector functions. Afterthe resolution of the malignancy (or infection), a small fraction of the effec- tor cells will become memory T cells capable of expansion upon future antigen exposure ( Belardelli & Ferrantini, 2002; Farber et al., 2014 ). Due to this complex development process involving orchestrated traffickingand localization of T cells, whole-body noninvasive imaging can address difficult biological questions that cannot be answered using traditional blood or biopsy samples. PET imaging provides a partial solution to this problemby providing the ability to track populations of cells in vivo by adjusting theprobe of interest ( Phelps, 2000 ). Subclasses of PET include immuno-PET, prelabeling with radionuclides, reporter gene strategies, and small molecule probes. Each technology is described in detail with current applicationsbelow. By adapting one or more PET probes, serial scans can provide lon-gitudinal information or be applied to investigate alternative processes, allwith quantitative noninvasive whole-body detection. 1.4 PET Principles PET scanners detect the location of positron-emitting probes in vivo and produce a three-dimensional (3D) image (reviewed in Phelps, 2000 ). As the probe decays, positrons from the radionuclide annihilate with an191 PET Detection of T Cell Responseselectron in nearby tissue and emit two antiparallel 511 keV high-energy photons. PET technology employs detectors that identify coincident emissions and use the information derived from the lines of response to reconstruct a quantitative 3D activity map. Preclinical microPET scanners typically have spatial resolutions of 1 -2 mm, whereas clinical scanners have a resolution of approximately 1 cm, which is sufficient to detect lymph nodes in both instances ( Cherry & Gambhir, 2001; Gambhir, 2002 ). For immunology or T cell studies evaluating alterations in lymph nodes, a cor- egistered PET/CT scan can be most accurate for determining size, location, and probe accumulation. Dense tissue, such as bone, does not scatter the high-energy photons in small animal imaging; however, attenuation correc- tion is required for accurate quantification of PET images in the clinical set- ting. Other physiological differences between mice and men may change how probes are distributed in vivo. As discussed below, different metabolic rates, physiological differences in the half-lives of antibodies, or changes in metabolite serum concentrations can all effect how probes are distributed and accumulated in vivo. 2. EX VIVO CELL LABELING FOR TRACKING IMMUNE CELLS IN VIVO Ex vivo cell labeling is a process in which cells of interest are harvested, incubated with the radiotracer of choice for intracellular uptake and reten- tion, and then infused back into the patient for subsequent noninvasive detection ( Fig. 1 ). Generally, the radiotracers are taken up by cells via passive Fig. 1 Ex vivo radiolabeling of cells. In this example, cytotoxic lymphocytes transduced with a TCR specific for a tumor antigen are radiolabeled and are reintroduced for cell tracking to antigen-positive tumors. This provides information regarding both success- ful tumor targeting and the presence of the tumor antigen.192 M.N. McCracken et al.diffusion due to the use of lipophilic chelators and are retained by binding to intracellular proteins. There are many aspects of ex vivo cell labeling that need to be optimized/determined to establish a reproducible radiolabelingprocedure that does not cause toxicity for the cells of interest prior to imag-ing experiments, such as incubation time, radioactivity concentration percell, retention of radioactivity over time, viability, radiotoxicity, DNA dam- age, and altered phenotype or activation state. The significant drawbacks of this approach are the restricted longitudinal imaging due to radiotracer half-life, radiotracer dilution due to cell proliferation or cell death, and the smallamount of radioactivity that can accumulate in each cell. In the context of radiolabeled T cells, strict attention needs to be made on cellular activa- tion and cell death due to established radiosensitivity of T lymphocytes.Although this is a relatively routine procedure in nuclear medicine, it isnonetheless a labor-intensive process. Since the 1970s, clinical nuclear medicine departments have routinely used planar scintigraphy in combination with ex sites inflammation or infection ( Hughes, 2003; Peters, 1994 ). The advent of SPECT/CT has enhanced the diagnostic capability of gammaradionuclide-labeled leukocytes in the clinic ( Djekidel, Brown, & Piert, 2011 ). These methods are still used clinically because the detection of locations of infection can be critical for the clinical management of patients. However, certain clinical applications requiring the detection of small num- bers of cells in small volumes have created the need for PET cell-labelingmethods due to enhanced sensitivity, quantification, and resolution ofclinical PET scanners ( Rahmim & ([18F]-FDG) suffers from rapid efflux, low radiolabeling efficiency of cells with low glucose metabolism,and the relatively short physical half-life of 18F (110 Bhargava, Gupta, Mullan, Hung, Lowe, & Thorson, 2000 ). In one study, investigators found that activated human T cells radiolabeled with [18F]-FDG suffered from radiotracer efflux, decreased proliferation, and reduced cytotoxic activity ( Botti et al., 1997 ). Recently, the use of [18F]-4-fluorobenzamido- N-ethylamino-maleimide ([18F]-FBEM) for conjugate18F to cell surface thiols did not reduce T lymphocyte viability and demonstrated homing of T lymphocytes to the spleen at 90 min postinjection ( Lacroix et al., 2013 ). The longer-lived radionuclide64Cu (12.7 h) allows tracking of cells over a longer period of193 PET Detection of T Cell Responsestime. In animals,64Cu-pyruvaldehyde- bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (64Cu-PTSM)-labeled leukocytes were shown to migrate to the spleens of mice as detected by PET ( Fig. 2 )(Adonai et al., 2002 ). However, the64Cu cell-labeling tracer suffered from rapid efflux resulting in nonspecific liver uptake ( Adonai et al., 2002 ). Recently,89Zr (3.2 days) was used to radiolabel various cell types, including human leukocytes, with higher intracellular retention than the typical 111In radiolabeling approach allowing fo r cell tracking at 7 days postinjection (Charoenphun et al., 2015 ). The noninvasive imaging of T cell trafficking in vivo in tumor models could provide information pertaining to the ability of targeted cells to migrate to regions of interest, such as antigen expressing tumors in Fig. 264Cu-PTSM-labeled lymphocytes. Mice were injected intravenously with lympho- cytes radiolabeled ex vivo with64Cu-PTSM and images were acquired at 0.12 h (A), 3.12 h (B), and 18.9 h (C) postinjection. PET images show that the adoptively trans- ferred lymphocytes initially traffic through the lungs and then accumulate in the spleen and liver. Lu, lungs; Li, liver; Sp, spleen; In, intestine.

McCracken et al.the context of TCR- or CAR-engineered T cells. Initial preclinical studies tracking cytotoxic lymphocytes to tumors were performed used111In-oxine-radiolabeled tumor-specific T cell migration, demonstratingthat lymphodepletion before adoptive cell transfer enhanced bothintratumoral migration of T cells and antitumor efficacy ( Pittet et al., 2007 ). More recently,111In-tropoline-labeled human CAR T cells were injected by alternate routes into tumor-free or tumor-bearing immune-incompetent mice to monitor CAR T cell trafficking ( Parente-Pereira et al., 2011 ). Only recently has PET been used to track CD8+T cells to tumors. In one example, activated ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD8+T cells (OT-I) were efficiently radiolabeled with89Zr-oxine, demonstrating efficient cellular retention of89Zr. Importantly, no effects on OT-I proliferation and activation as monitored by expression of CD69, CD25, and CD44 as well as production of IFN- and IL-2 were observed ( Sato et al., 2015 ). The89Zr-labeled CD8 T cells injected into wild-type mice showed migration to the spleen and lymph nodes up to 7 days postinjection. Subse- quently,89Zr-OT-I cells were injected into RAG1 knockout mice bearing B16-OVA melanoma tumors demonstrating low tumor targeting via PET,but no antigen-negative tumors were shown as control for background andnonspecific targeting ( Sato et al., 2015 ). The use of PET to address T cell migration patterns was performed using 64Cu-radiolabeled T h1 CD4+T cells expressing the MHC-II-restricted TCR specific for OVA (OT-II) in the model of chicken OVA-induced air-way hypersensitivity inflammation. Initially, 64Cu-PTSM radiolabeled OT-II were used to monitor the different migration patterns as a result of intravenous or intraperitoneal administration ( Griessinger et al., 2014 ). They demonstrated cell tracking for 48 h postinjection based on optimized radio-labeling conditions that reduced, but did not abolish, the harmful effectsdue to 64Cu-radiolabeling, such as viability, apoptosis, proliferation, IFN- production, and DNA double-strand breaks. A second approach by the same group used a64Cu-radiolabeled antibody specific for the TCR expressed on OT-II cells to utilize TCR plasma membrane turnover forintracellular radiolabeling ( Griessinger et al., 2015 ). This method resulted in reduced radiation-induced cellular damage, decreased radiotracer efflux compared to64Cu-PTSM, and reduced background in PET studies. This method can potentially be applied to radiolabeling CD8+cytotoxic T cells specific for tumor antigens to reduce radiation-induced cell damage.195 PET Detection of T Cell ResponsesIn the future, ex vivo cell labeling of T cells with PET radiotracers could provide information on successful delivery and tumor targeting of TCR- and CAR-engineered T cells for antitumor immunotherapy. Tracking theseengineered T cells to antigen-positive tumors could determine successfultumor-specific delivery of therapeutic T cells and potentially determineantigen expressing vs antigen-negative tumors in metastatic patients. However, ex vivo radiolabeling will not provide information about the presence of adoptively transferred cells at weeks posttransfer due to the lim-itation of radionuclide half-life. Consistent T cell handling, incubationtimes, radiolabeling efficiency, viability, and phenotype of T cells must be established for routine clinical use. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the limits of radioactivity per cytotoxic T cell will be sufficient for PETdetection of low T cell numbers migrating to tumors in patients. 3. SMALL MOLECULE METABOLITE PROBES FOR TRACKING T CELLS 3.1 Introduction of Radiolabeled Metabolites Small molecules and metabolites can be modified or directly radiolabeled to mimic their native compounds and used to track metabolic processes in vivo. This category of PET probes is the most widely used accounting for almost all clinical scans. Examples of probes include analogs of sugars, nucle-osides, amino acids, small molecule drugs, hormones, or neurotransmitters( Serdons, Verbruggen, & Bormans, 2009 ). Once injected, the probe distri- bution and accumulation demonstrate where an increased consumption of the metabolite is in comparison to other tissues within the body. When imaging with small molecule probes the time from injection to scanning is usually short in comparison to other PET probes (ranging fromminutes to only a few hours after infusion) since most of these tracers exhibit rapid blood clearance. The fast metabolism of most small molecule probes also favors the use of short and intermediate half-life radioisotopes. In mostcases, 18F is utilized due to its intermediate half-life (110 min) providing enough time for radiochemical synthesis, transport, and imaging ( Serdons et al., 2009 ).18F chemistry frequently replaces a hydrogen or hydroxyl group with the18F isotope to allow for a metabolite mimetic. In some instances, a Cl or F atom is initially present and can be directly replaced by the radio-isotope. In cases where 18F chemistry cannot be applied other radioisotopes such as11C or in rare cases15O and13N can be used ( Cherry & Gambhir, 2001; Serdons et al., 2009 ).11C has a 20 min half-life requiring high starting196 M.N. McCracken et al.11C activity in order to complete synthesis and purification with enough activity remaining for imaging due to the rapid decay. Small molecule probes are also radiolabeled at a high specific activity to allow for the total probe administered to be only pico- to femtomole pergram of tissue ( Cherry & Gambhir, 2001; Phelps, 2000 ). Due to the extremely low serum concentration, most probes function with no biolog- ical or effect Massoud & Gambhir, 2003 ). The remaining probe not accumulated by the target tissue is then excreted in most cases through renal filtration or hepatic clearance.The total radiation exposure from metabolic probes is usually highest in the kidneys and bladder due to the rapid excretion. Total exposure in these organs is typically used for determining the radiation limit (dose-limitingorgan) and is not dependent on concentrations of the substrate ( Gambhir, 2002 ). To date, thousands of unique PET probes have been made (The Radiosynthesis Database of PET Probes [RaDaP]). We will cover key stud- ies that have applied metabolic probes to address T cell imaging using PET. To measure T cell activity and track lymphocyte function, metabolites that are specifically retained by T cells but not by other cell types are being developed. Each probe measures a specific metabolic process, but due to metabolism being transient and dependent on cell location and environ-ment, not all probes will work for all stages of T cell development oractivation ( Fox, Hammerman, & Thompson, 2005; Radu et al., 2008 ). The major limitations in metabolic and small molecule probes are the risk of accumulation in non-T cells, difficulty in synthesizing certain probes, and the fact that not all T cells will have the same metabolic demands(depending on state, location, etc.). However, identifying probes thatmonitor relevant changes in T cell metabolism in response to infection, cancer, or autoimmunity can be the basis of novel methods to assess appro- priate immune responses. 3.2 Measuring Enhanced Glucose Accumulation by [18F]-FDG The most widely used PET tracer is a fluorinated glucose analog [18F]-FDG. [18F]-FDG measures the glycolytic flux by being transported into cells and phosphorylation by hexokinase into [18F]-FDG-6-PO 4. The phosphoryla- tion traps the radiolabeled probe intracellularly and the position of the18F prevents further metabolism. Under normal physiological conditions, high [18F]-FDG accumulation is seen in metabolically active organs such as the brain and heart ( Phelps, 2000 ). In preclinical models of arthritis and197 PET Detection of T Cell Responsesmultiple sclerosis, [18F]-FDG has been used to monitor the severity of immune lesions which have been attributed to T cells ( Irmler et al., 2010; Matsui et al., 2009; Radu, Shu, Shelly, Phelps, & Witte, 2007 ). In clinical models, [18F]-FDG accumulation has been attributed to multiple benign conditions including inflammation ( Bakheet & Powe, 1998; Beckers et al., 2004 ). Although enhanced [18F]-FDG accumulation is observed in T cell responses, it has also been demonstrated that on a per cell basis, innate immune cells will have higher glucose consumption ( Nair-Gill et al., 2010 ). In addition, most tumors are highly glycolytic and [18F]-FDG is used as a primary clinical measure for tumor detection and staging, making it impossible to distinguish tumor signal from T cell signal ( Gambhir, 2002 ) (Fig. 3 ). For this reason, clinicians and investigators have looked for alterna- tive PET probes for tracking the antitumor T cell response ( Escuin-Ordinas et al., 2013 ). 3.3 Measuring Cell 30-Deoxy-30-[18F] Fluorothymidine Accumulation 30-Deoxy-30-[18F]fluorothymidine ([18F]-FLT) is radiolabeled kinase 1 (TK1). TK1 has maximal activity in dividing cells and peak expression is observed during S phase. Therefore, the accumulation of [18F]-FLT is used as a marker for cell proliferation in vivo ( Barthel et al., 2003; Wagner et al., 2003 ). In healthy dogs, signal was observed in the marrow indicating a site of high cellular proliferation (Wagner et al., 2003 ). Preclinical scans of canines with lymphoma then demonstrated a high signal accumulation within malignant lymph nodes Fig. 3 Metabolic imaging of cells. In this example, a radiolabeled glucose mimetic ([18F]- FDG) is directly given to patients. Cells with high glycolytic activity, including malignant cells and immune cells, will accumulate the probe.198 M.N. McCracken et al.identifying highly proliferative lymphoma cells. Transition into preclinical rodent studies with [18F]-FLT have been limited due to high serum thymi- dine in mice and rats (approximately 100 /C2higher than humans), limiting the efficacy of [18F]-FLT scans in these animals. For example, the average [18F]-FLT dose in humans is administered with endogenous thymidine at greater than 150-fold excess. The high amount of free thymidine in humans and even greater amounts in rodents has limited the sensitivity by blocking signal accumulation and retention. In clinical applications [18F]-FLT dem- onstrated an increased signal in lymph nodes and spleen of metastatic mel-anoma patients being treated with anti-CTLA4 ( Ribas et al., 2010 ). Results from this study are complicated, and cannot rule out T cell proliferation from other causes but trend toward an increase signal in spleen after anti-CTLA4 therapy. Similar to [ 18F]-FDG, deciphering [18F]-FLT signal within the tumor from immune cell infiltrates vs tumor cells is challenging and instead only measurements of hematopoietic tissues can be made ( Ribas et al., 2010; Shields et al., 1998 ). 3.4 Nucleoside Salvage Pathway Measured by Fluorinated Analog Probes [18F]-FLT and [18F]-FDG, although retained by T cells, cannot be used to distinguish between the proliferation of immune vs nonimmune cells in tumors. Recently, several groups have targeted the development of alterna-tive nucleoside analog PET probes specific for deoxycytidine al., 2011; al., 2010 ). is the rate-limiting enzyme in the nucleoside salvage path- way and is known to have high expression in proliferating/activated lym- phocytes. By targeting a metabolic pathway increased in T cells, thedetection of active immune responses can be identified more accurately thanwith [ 18F]-FDG or [18F]-FLT alone. phosphorylation dFdC traps the drug intracellularlyprior to further downstream phosphorylation and incorporation intoDNA. Accumulation of dFdC was the highest in activated T cells, but due to the presence of two fluorine atoms, this compound was not ame- nable for 18F radiochemistry. Removing one of the fluorine atoms and radiolabeling the second led to the development of [18F]-FAC cytosine) ( Radu et al., had strong retention in the spleen, thymus, and bone marrow of wild-type mice. A reduction in signal was observed when animals were199 PET Detection of T Cell Responsestreated with the systemic immunosuppressive drug dexamethasone, which is toxic to lymphocytes ( Radu et al., 2008 ). In a genetic knockout of dCK, a complete loss of [18F]-FAC signal in all lymphoid organs was seen, with a dramatic reduction in the total number of mature T and B cells ( Austin et al., 2012; Toy et al., 2010 ). Together these studies demonstrate the spec- ificity of [18F]-FAC for lymphoid tissues and the requirement of dCK for normal lymphopoiesis. In models of immune cell expansion such as viral-induced tumor or autoimmunity, an increased [18F]-FAC accumulation was seen in the thy- mus, lymph nodes, and spleen ( Fig. 4 )(Nair-Gill et al., 2010; Radu et al., 2008 ). Analysis of isolated immune cells identified that activated effec- tor CD8 T cells from the draining lymph node had the highest accumulation of [18F]-FAC in comparison to other immune cells (myeloid, B cells). The authors found that the accumulation correlated with proliferation, and dur- ing this immune insult, the activated CD8 T cells had the highest percentage Fig. 4 [18F]-FDG and [18F]-FAC metabolic imaging of the antitumor response in mice. Immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice were injected intramuscularly with the MSV/MuLV retrovirus that causes a sarcoma. Mice were then imaged at the peak immune response with [18F]-FAC on day 13 (A) and [18F]-FDG on day 14 (B) to track the antitumor response.

However, tumor-infiltrating T cells had lower accumu- lation, which may be due to a reduction in the proliferation/cell-cycling rates ( Nair-Gill et al., 2010 ). [18F]-FAC is more selective for lymphocytes than other metabolic probes but has limited capacity in detecting tumor-infiltrating T cells, identifying the need to develop additional T cell-specificprobes. In addition, it was observed that [ 18F]-FAC can accumulate in tumors that are sensitive to dFdC making it difficult to distinguish tumor from T cells in vivo ( Radu,2012 ). New, alternative nucleoside probes more specific for T cells are currently being developed. In a preliminary study, a radiolabeled AraG (20-deoxy-20- [18F]fluoro-9- -D-arabinofuranosylguanine ([18F]-F-AraG)) was synthe- sized with primary, activated, or lymphoblastic T cells (Namavari et al., 2011 ). Accumulation of [18F]-F-AraG was increased in activated T cells and in a leukemic cell line. Although animal studies using[ 18F]-F-AraG are limited, the promising preliminary data suggest that [18F]- F-AraG may be useful in detecting T cells or T cell malignancies in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo and ex vivo validation will determine whether [18F]-F-AraG is specific for T cells or has high retention in alternate organs. Other nucleoside analogs have demonstrated signal accumulation within themyocardium that is believed to be from the mitochondrial nucleosidekinases ( Campbell et al., 2012 ). 3.5 Current Limitations and Speculation on Alternative Probes or Pathways to Target T Cells Results from the studies described above are encouraging but still require additional probe development for understanding and detecting tumor-infiltrating T cells. One difficulty in designing T cell probes is the changein metabolism between T cells in lymph nodes and T cells located intratumorally as observed by Nair-Gill et al. (2010) . In order to identify which metabolites are necessary for tumor-infiltrating T cells, sophisticatedmetabolic studies will need to be done to tease out which metabolites arescavenged and taken in by the TILs vs those that are present prior to infil-tration. An additional challenge is finding a metabolite highly enriched in TILs but not utilized by the tumor. Although challenging, the successful development of a unique metabolic probe for TILs would be broadly useful.In an ideal case, the probe would be radiolabeled with 18Fo r11C for rapid201 PET Detection of T Cell Responsesimaging. Due to the fast decay, it would also be possible for patients to have a follow-up [18F]-FDG scan to track total tumor burden either the same or the following day. 4. PET REPORTER IMAGING FOR TRACKING ENGINEERED CELLS IN VIVO Engineering cells to express reporter genes is a common practice in preclinical research. Most often, investigators will engineer cells to includea fluorescent or bioluminescent reporter, which are restricted to preclinical applications due to the depth of penetration limits of optical detection methods ( Acton & Zhou, 2005; Herschman, 2004; Kircher et al., 2011 ). Similarly, cells can be engineered to express a PET reporter gene that canbe directly translated into clinical use. To date, one PET reporter gene has been translated into clinical use (NCI clinical trial, NCT01082926 ) (Yaghoubi et al., 2009 ). In PET, preclinical applications of reporters have been studied since 1996 with many studies investigating lymphocyte tracking after immuno-therapies ( Herschman, 2004; Tjuvajev et al., 1996 ). Reporter genes are ideal for therapies that need to monitor the fate of transplanted immune cells (Herschman, 2004 ). The exogenous protein is expressed in the cells trans- duced with the PET reporter and is then monitored for location, quantity,and distribution by the corresponding PET probe. Studies have tracked total hematopoietic cells, engineered T cells, dendritic cells, and other phagocytic cells in vivo but we will focus on the applications of PET reporter genes onlyin T cell biology for antitumor responses ( Herschman, 2004; Tjuvajev et al., 1996 ). The major limitations in reporter imaging are the need to genetically manipulate cells ex vivo and the risk of immunogenicity from ectopic expression of a foreign protein. 4.1 Advantages and Subclasses of PET Reporter Genes PET reporters fall generally into three distinct categories: transporter, mem-brane bound, or enzymatic ( Herschman, 2004 )(Fig. 5 ). The corresponding probes are therefore designed to minimize off-target signal or signal fromnonengineered T cells. Investigators are then able to detect cells expressing the reporter gene in vivo by imaging with the corresponding reporter pro- be ( Fig. 6 ). Stable expression of a PET reporter also overcomes some of the variability of imaging using metabolic PET probes allowing for more202 M.N. McCracken et al.consistent detection regardless of tissue location. This is important for sequential imaging that can occur days to months after the initial transplant. Extracellular or membrane-bound reporters allow for direct targeting by the radiolabeled probe and are limited based on total surface expression. Fig. 5 Types of PET reporter genes. PET reporter genes are one of three categories: extracellular, transporter, or enzyme. Extracellular reporters can include unique trans- membrane proteins that can be targeted with small molecules or engineered anti- bodies/proteins. Transporter reporters bring probes in intracellularly and allow for accumulation. Enzyme, or kinase, reporters modify or phosphorylate probes to allow for intracellular accumulation. Fig. 6 Reporter gene imaging of adoptive cell therapy. Isolated T cells are engineered to express a PET reporter gene (and TCR or CAR). Cells are then adoptively transferred into recipients. At later time points, reporter-labeled cells are detected by injection of the reporter-specific probe.203 PET Detection of T Cell ResponsesMembrane transporters improve signal to noise by actively transporting their probe intracellularly leading to an accumulation. Lastly, the most common PET reporters are kinase reporters that phosphorylate-specificradiolabeled PET probes. Phosphorylated molecules are typically trappedwithin cells that express the reporter leading to an increase in signal com-pared to nonreporter cells ( Herschman, 2004 ). These kinase PET reporter genes (and in theory membrane bound) have also been demonstrated as effective suicide genes allowing for selective cell elimination if needed.For antitumor T cells, the ability to monitor subsets of cells (ie, only theengineered T cells expressing a CAR, TCR, or transduced TILs) and remove them in the case of adverse events by suicide gene action is advan- tageous in both clinical and preclinical applications. 4.2 Extracellular PET Reporters Receptor-based PET reporter genes have been developed, but theirapplications to tracking antitumor T cell imaging have not been tested.A truncated recombinant carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was tested as a potential PET reporter gene by expression in the Jurkat T cell leukemia cell line ( Kenanova et al., 2009 ). Imaging using an engineered anti-CEA antibody fragment (minibody; see later) detected CEA-positive Jurkat cells,thereby demonstrating the potential applications of receptor or genes ( Barat, Kenanova, Olafsen, & Wu, 2011; Kenanova et al., 2009 ). The type 2 human somatostatin receptor (hSSTr2) was orig- inally targeted as a highly expressed target on neuroendocrine tumors, withSPECT and PET agents developed for diagnosis and staging ( Gabriel et al., 2007 ). Outside of these tumors, expression of hSSTr2 is low throughout the body making this a suitable PET reporter gene. Several studies have demonstrated longitudinal reporter imaging with [68Ga]-DOTATOC in mouse models of xenografts and AAV virus ( Zhang et al., 2011; Zinn & Chaudhuri, 2002 ). Recently, investigators have made decoy or truncated receptors for tracking T cells by flow cytometry or for use as a suicide gene. These trun-cated receptors include CD34 ( Qasim et al., 2007; Zhan et al., 2013 ), CD20 (Philip et al., 2014 ), epidermal growth factor (EGFR) ( Mardiros et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011 ), and low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (CD271) (Bonini et al., 2003; Thomis et al., 2001 ). In each instance, the signaling domains have been removed making the truncated protein nonfunctional.In some cases, the intracellular portion has been fused to a secondary suicide204 M.N. McCracken et al.gene ( Thomis et al., 2001; Zhan et al., 2013 ). Normal T cells also lack expression of these receptors allowing engineered cells to be distinguished from other subsets by flow cytometry using a fluorescently labeled antibodyagainst the receptor. Investigators have also tested antibody therapy in vivoas a method to selectively eliminate reporter-labeled cells ( Wang et al., 2011 ). In theory, these same antibodies clones used for suicide gene function or flow cytometry could be radiolabeled and used for an in vivo PET reporter scan. Additional information on radiolabeling antibodies isdescribed in Section 5 . 4.3 Transporter PET Reporter Adoptive T cells reactive to Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) were engineered to express the human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) as a PET reportergene and detected by [ 124I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine ([124I]-MIBG) (Doubrovin et al., 2007 ). Initially, T cells were injected intratumorally and imaged after 4 h. hNET was able to detect as little as 104cells per tumor in the microPET scan. Investigators then tracked the long-term tumor infil-tration when EBV reactive CD8 T cells expressing the hNET PET reporterwere transplanted intravenously. On days 1, 8, and 28, animals were scanned showing a progressive increase in signal from the TILs. Although hNET was capable of detecting a small number of engineered T cells, when comparedto enzymatic PET reporters hNET was determined to be less sensitive( Doubrovin et al., 2007 ). The sodium iodine symporter (NIS) is an alternative transporter expressed endogenously in the thyroid and stomach. Ectopic expressionof NIS can allow reporter gene imaging by administration of iodine radio-nuclides ( 124I,131I) for PET or alternative isotopes for SPECT ( Penheiter, Russell, & Carlson, 2012 ). In preclinical studies, the expression of NIS was detected by124I in cancer cells infected with adenovirus expressing NIS ( Groot-Wassink et al., 2004 ). One advantage to NIS is the high spec- ificity demonstrated in vivo without needing to synthesize or radiolabel areporter-specific probe or by utilizing 18F probes that have a short half-life (Jauregui-Osoro et al., 2010 ). 4.4 Enzymatic PET Reporters Kinase PET reporter genes have been the most widely used in tracking anti-tumor T cells. One reason for utilizing a kinase PET reporter is that even with low expression, the signal is amplified due to the enzymatic turnover205 PET Detection of T Cell Responsesrate of the reporter ( Herschman, 2004 ). The probe is administered systemically and cells must actively transport the probe intracellularly. Once the probe is intracellular, the reporter enzyme can phosphorylateand trap the modified probe intracellularly. Continued phosphorylationof free probe leads to an accumulation in signal allowing for detection ofreporter-labeled cells. In cells lacking the reporter, the probe can freely efflux, reducing nonspecific signal. Therefore, the largest limitation of enzymatic PET reporter genes is that the probe must be delivered into cellsby endogenous transporters that are not coregulated by the PET reportergene and whose activity may vary depending on cell state or location ( Acton & Zhou, 2005; Gambhir et al., 2013; Pastor-Anglada et al., 2001; Radu et al., Simplex Virus Type Thymidine Kinase Reporters in Preclinical Models The first enzymatic PET reporter gene described was herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-TK). Initially, HSV-TK was demon-strated as a suicide gene with selective elimination of expressing cellsby acycloguanosine compounds such as ganciclovir (GCV) ( Tiberghien et al., 1994 ). HSV-TK was then used as a reporter in SPECT imaging with a radiolabeled 5-iodo-20-fluoro-20deoxy-1-beta- D-arabinofuranosyluracil (FIAU) demonstrating the of engineered reporters probesfor noninvasive imaging ( Tjuvajev et al., 1995 ). To increase resolution and sensitivity investigators then designed and radiolabeled PET probes for HSV-TK to be used as a PET reporter with124Ia n d18F(Gambhir et al., 1998; Tjuvajev et al., 1998 ). In each case, a radiolabeled acycloguanosine-like- compound was able to visualize HSV-TK expression in mice. In 2002, a mutant form of HSV-TK with improved Vmax/Kmfor GCV (sr39TK, described by Gambhir et al., 2000 ) was used to monitor tumor burden in mice transplanted with sr39TK expressing leukemic cells( Le et al., 2002 ). This study was the first demonstration of the feasibility for PET reporter imaging of HSV-TK as a tool to monitor the location of systemic immune cells not located as a subcutaneous graft. HSV-TK was then applied to monitor the migration of EBV reactive human T cells intotumors expressing EBV antigens in mice ( Koehne et al., 2003 ). Signal was observed in the spleen and in the EBV+ HLA-matched tumors with peak signal seen at 48 h. Infused cells could be monitored by PET imaging for up to 15 days posttransplant. In contrast, cells that were prelabeled206 M.N. McCracken et al.with the analog fialuridine-20-deoxy-20-[18F]fluoro-5-iodo-1- -D-arabinofuranosyluracil) (half-life 4.18 days) in vitro maintained signal up to 8 days postinfusion( Koehne et al., 2003 ). This encouraging longitudinal reporter imaging study demonstrated that both prelabel and in vivo probe administration can be usedto track T cells homing intratumor in mice. Most recent studies with HSV-TK have shifted away from the [ 124I]-FIAU probe and instead utilize a penciclovir analog, 9-(4-[18F]- fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl) guanine ([18F]-FHBG). These studies have successfully tracked the location and infiltration of tumor reactive T cells in mouse models of immunotherapy. These have included engineered TCRs, CARs, and tumor reactive T cells from viral-induced et et al., al., 2010; Shu et al., 2005, 2009; Vatakis et al., 2011 ). Animals that received a bone marrow transplant with cells engineered to express HSV-TK were challenged with a viral-induced sarcoma and this allowed for the detection of aprimary antitumor T cell response in vivo ( Shu et al., 2005 ). The dual func- tionality and efficacy of sr39TK as a reporter and suicide gene were recently validated in a humanized mouse model ( Gschweng et al., 2014; Vatakis et 2011 ). Human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were transduced to express a TCR and sr39TK. Engraftment and T cell developmentwere tracked by [ 18F]-FHBG signal. To ablate the engineered cells, thera- peutic doses of GCV were given. Efficacy was determined by follow-up [18F]-FHBG scans that displayed little to no signal in ablated animals (Gschweng et al., 2014 ). By incorporating HSV-TK, reporter T cells are detected with a 3D image of the location of engineered cells. This has enabled investigators to decipher tumor draining lymph nodes signal from tumor signal because of the improved resolution of PET in comparison to alternative imagingmodalities. 4.4.2 Clinical Applications with HSV-TK PET Reporters HSV-TK was first given to patients clinically when expanded lymphocytes used to treat graft vs leukemia were engineered to express HSV-TK as a suicide gene. Expression of HSV-TK was immunogenic in patientswith CD8 T cells against the gene ( Berger, Flowers, Warren, & Riddell, 2006; Traversari et al., 2007 ). Immune responses were rapid and most likely due to memory T cells. In contrast, no preclinical studies have reported immunogenicity from HSV-TK in mice. The lack of prior207 PET Detection of T Cell Responsesexposure to HSV may prevent mice from developing immunogenicity to this PET reporter making it useful as a preclinical tool. Although immunogenicity was observed, there are a number of positive reasons to utilize HSV-TK as a reporter gene clinically. To date, one casereport has been published on the use of HSV-TK PET reporter in clinicaluse ( Yaghoubi et al., 2009 ). This patient presented with glioblastoma (GBM) and was enrolled in a clinical trial of ACT with engineered T cells expressing the IL-13 zetakine and HSV-TK. [18F]-FHBG scans showed a demonstrably higher signal after the infusion of engineeredT cells within the tumor lesions of the brain. Due to the brain being isolated the follow-up of cells after transplant is difficult and the peripheral blood is not believed to represent the state of intracranial T cells. The difficulty andhigh risk of complications from biopsy in GBM also make PET reporterimaging ideal. Interestingly, the observed immunogenicity seen with previ- ous ACT of lymphocytes expressing HSV-TK was not observed. This could be due to transplant conditions, location, or lack of HSV memory in therecipient. An additional success of this case report is the penetrance of[ 18F]-FHBG across the blood brain barrier. Under healthy physiological conditions, [18F]-FHBG does not cross ( Yaghoubi et al., 2001 ). The success of this case report led to an expanded trial ( NCT01082926 ) but results are yet to be published on the efficacy. 4.4.3 Human Nucleoside Kinase PET ReportersDue to the observed clinical immunogenicity when HSV-TK lymphocyteswere transplanted clinically, alternative enzymatic PET reporters have beendeveloped. The homologous human nucleoside kinases were tested as potential alternatives to HSV-TK in preclinical PET applications. Two mutant forms of human deoxycytidine kinase (hdCK) and one mutant formof human thymidine kinase 2 have been established as PET reporters( Campbell et al., 2012; Likar et al., 2010; McCracken et al., 2013, 2015 ). Expression of an hdCK mutant reporter (hdCKDM-point mutations and D133A) when with 20-[18F]-fluoro-20- deoxyarabinofuranosyl-5-ethyluracil ([18F]-FEAU) was able to track tumor-infiltrating CAR modified T cells in a humanized mouse model ofmetastatic prostate cancer ( Likar et al., 2010 ). Human T cells were first engineered to express hdCKDM and the Pz-1 CAR that is directed to prostate-specific membrane antigen. T cells were infused into mice andimaged 6 h posttransplant. Specific antitumor T cell signal was observedin the lung tumors of animals given the hdCKDM expressing T cells.208 M.N. McCracken et al.The rapid imaging time in this study demonstrates that hdCKDM could be used in monitoring cellular adoptive immunotherapy, including tracking the location of engineered cells within metastatic lesions ( Likar et al., 2010 ). A separate study evaluated the expression of hdCK3mut (three point mutations within the active site) with [18F]-L-FMAU to monitor tumor infiltration of immune cells in a humanized mouse model of melanoma (McCracken et al., 2015 ). Human CD34+cells engineered to express the PET reporter and an engineered TCR was engrafted into a modified humanized \"BLT\" (human bone marrow, liver, thymus) mouse model. Expression of hdCK3mut allowed for detection of reporter T cells intratumorally in HLA-matched/antigen-positive tumors ( Fig. 7 ). Impor- tantly, weak/no signal was seen in the HLA mismatched/antigen-positive Fig. 7 hdCK3mut PET reporter gene detects engineered T cells in vivo. NSG mice were humanized with CD34+human HSCs containing (TCR toward MART1). HSCs develop in vivo into CD8+T cells with the PET reporter and F5 TCR. Animals were sequentially transplanted with M202 (an HLA-A2.1 human melanoma cell line that is MART+,red(dark gray in the print version) circle on 2D projection) or M207 (a MART + cell line with a mismatch HLA, blue (gray in the print version) circle on 2D projection). PET reporter imaging with [18F]-L-FMAU demonstrates signal in bone marrow (sites of HSC engraftment) and within the tumor ( red(dark gray in the print version) circle, site of lymphocyte infiltration) seen in both the 3D and 2D projections. No signal is observed within the HLA mismatched tumor ( blue (gray in the print version) circle), demonstrating T cell homing into the correct HLA-matched tumor. Adapted from McCracken, M.

Isolated lymphocytes from these reporter mice were then subjected to activation and stimulation with reporter-labeled cells functioningequivalent to nonreporter cells. These studies show that hdCK-based PET reporter genes can be applied to current cell-based immunotherapies to monitor the location and longevity of transplanted engineered antitumor T cells. Examples of therapies that could benefit from reporter expression include tracking engineered T cell therapies(TCRs, CARs), or monitoring experimental GvHD. hdCK-based reportergenes have also been tested for long-term expression and normal T cell function in vivo ( Likar et al., 2010; McCracken Most impor- tantly, hdCKDM and hdCK3mut are human enzymes with minimal muta-tions and should thus not be immunogenic if translated into clinical studies. 4.5 Future Applications and Limitations in PET Reporter Imaging The major disadvantage of PET reporter gene imaging is the need to manipulate the cell either ex vivo or through targeted vector delivery invivo. Furthermore, inducing expression of a foreign protein may triggerimmune responses, or expression may impair function or cause malignant transformation to the reporter cells ( Kircher et al., 2011; Koehne et al., 2003 ). In preclinical studies, no impact on T cell function was observed when kinase PET reporter genes were expressed ( Koya et al., 2010; Likar et al., 2010; McCracken al., 2015; Vatakis et al., 2011 ). Another disad- vantage to viral gene delivery is the risk of insertional oncogenesis, vector splicing, or vector silencing ( Blumenthal et al., 2007 ). Although these issues can arise due to the use of viral vectors, the coexpression of a PET reporterwith a CAR or TCR will not increase the likelihood of these events. Future directions of PET reporter genes include targeting T cell activa- tion or specific subsets of cells by using lineage-specific promoters. One pre- clinical mouse study has tested this concept by utilizing HSV-TK expressionand PET reporter imaging to detect cells in vivo only after T cell activation( Ponomarev et al., 2001 ). Jurkat cells (a human T-ALL cell line) were trans- duced with HSV-TK under the control of the TCR-dependent nuclear fac- tor of activated T cells promoter allowing for detection in animals only whentreated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 to activate cells. Similar induciblereporter systems may be helpful in addressing the behavior of immune cells after immunotherapies (eg, anti-PD1, DC vaccine, anti-CTLA4, or engineered T cells with TCRs or CARs) are given allowing for detectionof a small subset of cells. In particular, if signal is weak or absent, or if signal is210 M.N. McCracken et al.seen outside the tumor, it might predict treatment failure or off-target acti- vation. Lineage-induced reporters would also be useful in tracking the development/fate of lymphoid lineages including tumor-infiltrating T reg cells. Prior to implementing these technologies, advances in the current lin-eage reporters are needed to amplify expression increasing the overall sen-sitivity of lineage inducible systems ( Hildebrandt & Gambhir, 2004 ). Improvements in the PET reporter probes nonspecific background will enable reporter genes to be applied to a greater number of tumor-infiltratingT cell tracking studies. For example, [ 18F]-FHBG has high gastrointestinal uptake and clearance through the kidneys and bladder ( Yaghoubi et al., 2001 ). This would make imaging within the peritoneal cavity especially near the intestines difficult. Other probes including [18F]-L-FMAU have higher liver uptake in humans, potentially limiting detection of reporter cells withinthis organ ( Campbell et al., 2012 ). In each instance, these are sites that could potentially harbor primary or metastatic lesions and probes with low/no background would increase the use of PET reporters. Low probe back-ground will also increase sensitivity, or superior PET reporter activity willenable detection below the current limits for studies tracking a small number of cells ( Moroz et al., 2015 ). To date, the most common use of HSV-TK clinically has been as a sui- cide gene with the reporter gene as a secondary function. When given phar-macological doses of acycloguanosine compounds (eg, GCV), the HSV-TKexpressing selectively eliminated Gschweng al., 2014; Tiberghien et al., 1994 ). The truncated receptors expressed on the cell sur- face that are designed for selective elimination if necessary by a therapeuticantibody are predicted to also function as a dual reporter/suicide gene( Wang et al., 2011 ). For the new human enzymatic PET reporters being developed, the potential of utilizing the reporter as a suicide gene has been discussed ( Likar et al., 2010; McCracken et al., 2015 ). It is anticipated that those drugs with a higher affinity for these reporters should also function as asuicide gene/drug combination. In future studies, the codevelopment of the suicide gene function will allow investigators to remove reporter cells in case of adverse events, improving the safety of engineered T cell-based therapies. 5. IN VIVO DETECTION OF IMMUNE CELLS USING RADIOLABELED PROTEINS 5.1 In Vivo Cell Labeling Using Radiolabeled Proteins Targeting of extracellular epitopes in vivo by utilizing the high specificity of antibodies to tumor-specific antigens, a concept first introduced by Paul211 PET Detection of T Cell ResponsesEhrlich, has long been a goal of cancer therapy to eradicate tumors. Intact IgG antibodies engage multiple proteins, including the antigen of interest determined by the variable domains and both Fc-receptors and complementby the Fc domain. Antibodies function directly by either blockingproliferative signaling networks on tumor cells (EGFR) or modulation ofsignaling via coinhibitory or costimulatory receptors (CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 or 4-1BB and CD40, respectively). Antibodies also function indirectly by eliciting immune responses utilizingthe antibody Fc domain engaging Fc receptors on immune cells (antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity) or complement (complement-dependent cytotoxicity). Furthermore, antibody half-life is extended by the use of Fc binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). The utility of antibodieshas been demonstrated by their therapeutic development across a varietyof clinical settings, including inflammatory diseases, transplantation, infec- tious diseases, cardiovascular medicine, and agonistic and antagonistic cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, the development of bispecific antibodies,fusion proteins, and antibody -drug conjugates continues to revolutionize the field due to advances in protein engineering ( Carter, 2011 ). The clinical impact of antibody-derived therapeutics is demonstrated by the fact that there are currently over 30 FDA approved antibodies for the treatment ofa variety of diseases and hundreds more are currently in clinical development( Reichert, 2010, 2015 ). The clinical success of antibodies validates the delivery of antibodies to specific targets in vivo and has led to the development of antibodies and antibody fragments as molecular imaging agents ( Fig. 8 ). In the context of oncology, antibody-based imaging has the ability to profile cell surfacemarkers expressed on tumors in vivo, with applications in primary and met- astatic tumor detection, patient staging and stratification in treatment groups, determining radioimmunotherapy dosing and receptor occupancy,and evaluation of response to therapy ( Knowles & Wu, 2012 ). Early efforts into intact antibody imaging utilized planar scintigraphy or SPECT with several receiving their use is very restricted due to limitations in sensitivity, quantification, and immunogenicity. Withthe expansion of target validation, protein and antibody engineering, antibody humanization, availability of long-lived PET radionuclides, and the use of PET in clinics across the globe, the translational potential ofimmuno-positron emission tomography (immuno-PET) is increasing 2009 ).212 M.N. McCracken et al.5.2 Radiotracer Design The long circulation half-lives of intact antibodies that range from days to weeks requires the use of long-lived PET radionuclides, such as124I (4.2 days),89Zr (3.2 days), and, to a extent,64Cu of intact antibodies is generally 5 -7 days postinjection of the radiotracer, resulting in increased radiation dose for the patient and inconvenient patient scheduling. To enhance the target- to-background at early times postinjection, reduce radiation exposure, and make use of short-lived radionuclides, antibody engineering has allowed for the construction of antibody fragments for immuno-PET, including dia- bodies and minibodies ( Fig. 9 A) (Olafsen & terminal half-life /C245-10 h) fragments allow for directed clearance through either the kidney or liver, respectively, due to the renal filtration cutoff of /C2460 kDa. Although the total overall anti- gen targeting (as indicated by percentage injected dose per gram or %ID/g) of antibody fragments is reduced compared to the respective intact antibody, it is the high target-to-background ratio at early times postinjection that allows for the potential of same day imaging and the use of shorter-lived PET radionu- clides, including18F,68Ga, and61Cu. Fig. 8 In antigens. In this example, a cys-diabody is radiolabeled and then injected for targeting endogenous antigens present in the tumor immune microenvironment. These antigens can be cell type specific, such as CD8 or CD4 on T cells ( orange (gray in the print version)) and CD11b expressed on MDSCs ( green (dark gray in the print version)), or activation specific, such as the checkpoint inhibitors CTLA-4 or PD-1 expressed on tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( yellow (white in the print version)) or PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and/or MDSCs ( blue (dark gray in the print version)). Purple (dark gray in the print version) antigens are tumor-specific antigens that can also be targeted using immuno-PET.213 PET Detection of T Cell ResponsesSimultaneously, advances in protein engineering and molecular evolu- tion strategies have led to the construction of highly diverse libraries derived from either immunoglobulin-like structures, such as the human fibronectin type III domain and single domain antibodies, or derived from various other protein-based scaffolds, such as affibodies and cyclic peptides among multi- ple others ( Hosse, Rothe, & Power, 2006 )(Fig. 9 B). These libraries allow for the selection of high affinity binders to virtually all antigens of interest. The molecular weight of these scaffolds is below the renal filtration cutoff and due to their small size have inherently fast clearance rates in vivo, further expanding the use of the shorter-lived PET radionuclides. However, as clearance rates increase, the ability to target the antigen of interest is decreased due to reduced antigen exposure, which has led to technologies that prolong the circulation time, such as PEGylation and fusion to albumin or IgG-binding domains ( Kontermann, 2011 ). Whatever the engineered scaffold, the designed radiotracer must radiolabeled with a suitable PET radionuclide and sufficiently bind the antigen of interest for in vivo PET detection. When generating a protein-based radiotracer, there are other variants to take into account other than radionuclide selection based on half-life for optimal probe design, such as conjugation strategy, chelator, target antigen, Fig. 9 Protein-based scaffolds for targeting cell surface antigens in vivo. (A) Antibodies and the respective antibody fragments engineered for enhanced immuno-PET charac- teristics can be radiolabeled for targeting endogenous antigens in vivo. (B) Similarly, alternate protein scaffolds that are engineered to bind antigens of interest can be engineered and radiolabeled for targeting antigens in vivo.214 M.N. McCracken et al.antigen internalization, valency and route of clearance, among others (reviewed in Wu, 2014 ). Radionuclides are conjugated to an antibody directly or indirectly via the use of a bifunctional chelator halogenation of radioiodine to solvent exposed tyrosine res-idues. This method is not suitable for radiotracers that target rapidly inter- nalizing antigens, as dehalogenation and intracellular catabolism cause of radioiodine and the radiometabolite iodotyrosine, respec-tively, from the target tissue. Furthermore, iodination can potentially reduceantigen-binding capacity if the halogenation occurs to critical tyrosines in the antigen-binding site. Indirect conjugation generally requires a bifunctional chelator that contains a radiometal chelator to form a complexwith a radiometal and a reactive group that binds to the protein. The use ofresidualizing radiometals causes intracellular retention of radioactive metab- olites internalization and catabolism. This results in accumula- tion of radioactivity in both the target cells and the organs of clearance, suchas the liver and kidney. Conjugation of bifunctional chelators has been directed to the nucleophilic -amino groups of solvent exposed lysine residues using N- hydroxysuccinimide esters or isothiocyanates, for example. This nonsite-specific conjugation approach has the ability to abolish antigen-bindingcapabilities if the conjugation occurs to critical lysine residues in the antigen-binding site. As the radiotracer scaffold reduces in size, the conjugation to lysines with chelators or tyrosine via direct iodination becomes more crucial as there are less available noncritical solvent exposed lysines or tyrosinesavailable for conjugation. Nonsite-specific conjugation methods result in a dis-tribution conjugated products all with different chelator-to-protein ratios resultingin alteredpharmacokineticsof different species in thesame batch. This conjugation strategy can also result in inconsistent batch-to-batch conjuga-tions. Therefore, site-specific conjugation methods have become increasinglyimportant to create a single, homogenous and well-characterized radiotracer thatcanbeconsistentlyandefficientlyproduced.Forexample,theintroduction of an engineered cysteine residue can drive conjugation of sulfhydryl-reactive bifunctional chelators away from the antigen-binding site to reducethe probability of affecting the antigen-binding capacity of the radiotracer.In combination with the utility of small protein targeting scaffolds, the expan- sion of bioorthogonal (radio)chemistry has radionuclides as rapid radiolabeling kinetics are T Cell Responses(Sletten & Bertozzi, 2009; Zeng, Zeglis, Lewis, & Anderson, 2013 ). The variety of bioconjugation techniques for protein radiochemistry is constantly evolving to establish best-in-class imaging agents. The pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled proteins varies greatly depending on the chelator, radionuclide, conjugation strategy, and purification tagdue to alterations in surface charge and conformation. For example, diabodies linkers, methods greatly affects the renal hepatic clearance ( Li et al., 2002; Tavar /C19e, Wu, et al., 2014 ). Similarly, studies performed with affibodies demonstrate the impact of purification tag sequence and location, chelator, radiometal, and conjugation method on tumor below the renal filtration cutoff of /C2460 kDa suffer from high renal accumulation, efforts have been made to determine the optimal radiometabolites of altered chelators that reduce radioactive renalaccumulation ( Uehara et al., 2014 ). Interestingly, the same chelator can behave very differently with the use of a different radiometal. In summary, the protein scaffold, conjugation strategy, radionuclide, and chelator used all effect the radiotracers pharmacokinetics, and a well-characterized and optimized combination of these factors will increaseradiotracer accumulation to the antigen of interest in vivo and, therefore,successful detection using PET. 5.3 Imaging Immune Cells with Radiolabeled Proteins Intact antibodies have been used previously to detect T and B cells in patients with a range of disorders using planar scintigraphy ( Malviya, Galli, Sonni, Pacilio, & Signore, efforts into targeting immune cells with radiolabeled antibodies resulted in the FDA to +tumor burden and radiotherapy estimates.89Zr-Zevalin was developed to predict90Y-Zevalin radio- immunothearpy doses Perk al., 2006; Rizvi et al., 2012 ). Subsequently, 89Zr-rituximab was used to determine the effect of the required predose of nonradiolabeled rituximab that is standard of care for90Y-anti-CD20 radioimmunotherapy ( et al., 2015 ). impaired216 M.N. McCracken et al.tumor targeting of90Y-radioimmunotherapy due to the use of a predose in patients that have already received rituximab-based therapy and calls into question the use of the predose to enhance anti-CD20radioimmunotherapy. 64Cu-rituximab has also been developed for clinical translation and PET detection of CD20 expression ( Natarajan, Arksey, Iagaru, engineered anti-CD20 radiotracer based on the human fibronectin type III domain was developed for rapid64Cu-PET detection of B cells ( Natarajan, Hackel, & Gambhir, ). CD8+cytotoxic T lymphocytes noninvasively using immuno-PET was recently demonstrated using antibody fragments targeting mouse CD8 derived from the parental depleting antibodies pro-duced from the hybridomas 2.43 and and YTS169 minibodies demonstrated in vivo specificity for CD8 nodesand spleens of antigen-positive mice ( Tavar /C19e, McCracken, et 2014 ). These engineered minibodies did not deplete CD8+T cells in vivo due to the removal of the full Fc domain when engineered to minibody format. More recently, the 2.43 cys-diabody was used to detect CD8+T cell repopulation over time in a model of HSC transfer ( Fig. 10 )(Tavar /C19e et al., 2015 ). Similarly, CD4+T cell repopulation was also detected using a newly developed anti-CD4 cys-diabody derived from the GK1.5 hybrid- oma ( Fig. ). This work demonstrated that anti-CD4 and -CD8 immuno- PET have the ability to monitor helper and cytotoxic T cell expansion andlocalization noninvasively and has the potential to detect enhanced T cellrepopulation from optimized HSC engraftment protocols. Antigen-specific HSC therapy utilizing CAR or TCRs has become an attractive therapeutic approach for long-term immunity for multiple malignancies. Anti-CD8immuno-PET may be able to detect CAR/TCR transduced HSC engraft-ment and subsequent T lymphocyte The YTS169 cDb specifically detected endogenous CD8 expressed in the spleen and lymph nodes of immune competent mice using 89Zr-immuno-PET ( Fig. 11 ).89Zr-YTS169 cDb could detect increased CD8+TILs in mice bearing CT26 colon carcinoma tumors treated with agonistic anti-CD137 antibody ). Immuno-PET tumors in untreated mice had a periph- eral ring of activity, while the tumors of anti-CD137-treated mice showedenhanced uptake throughout the tumor ( Fig. 11 ). Anti-CD8 immuno-PET217 PET Detection of T Cell Responseswas also used to detect tumor-infiltrating T cells in models of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and adoptive cell transfer ( Tavar /C19e et al., 2016 ). The ability to detect tumor-infiltrating macrophages has been demon- strated with recent work utilizing nanobodies to target myeloid cell markers. Initially, an Fig. 10 Anti-CD4 and -CD8 immuno-PET detection of helper and the parental depleting GK1.5 and 2.43 antibodies, respectively, injected into wild-type C57BL/6 mice ( left panel ) demonstrated specific detection of lymphoid organs and nonspecific kidney uptake due to renal clearance. In a model of hematopoietic stem cell therapy, wild-type mice were lethally irradiated prior to HSC therapy. Anti-CD4 and -CD8 immuno-PET was acquired at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after HSC therapy ( right panel ) demonstrating the detec- tion of helper and cytotoxic T cell repopulation over time. Immuno-PET images were acquired at 22 h postinjection and presented as 25 mm maximum intensity projections. ALN, axillary lymph nodes; B, bone; liver; PLN, popliteal lymph nodes; Sp, spleen.

More recently, this group has detect tumor-infiltrating macrophages with immuno-PET ( B l y k e r se ta l . ,2 0 1 5 ). Nanobodies targeting MHC-II and CD11b have been radiolabeled with18Ff o rP E Td e t e c t i o n of the myeloid-specific cell surface makers in vivo ( Rashidian et al., 2015 ). Specificity was demonstrated in vivo using MHC-II and CD11b knockout mice.

In World molecular imaging congress, Seoul, Korea .219 PET Detection of T Cell Responsesscaffolds selected to target endogenous immune cell subtypes in vivo have immense potential to grow as diagnostic and prognostic imaging agents in parallel with the cancer immunology targets being developed. PET detec-tion of immune antigens of interest using these targeted scaffolds couldprovide noninvasive information relating to the tumor microenvironment,predict responders from nonresponders to immunotherapeutic treatment, and detect antitumor responses posttherapy resulting from immune altering therapies. 5.4 Future Applications and Limitations of Radiolabeled Proteins for PET The dynamic tumor microenvironment has become a topic of great impor- tance in the field of tumor 2008 ). Specifically, the presence of various cell types, such as CD4 and CD8 TILs, regulatory T cells, macrophages, and monocyte-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), contribute to the up- or downregulation of antitumor immune responses.The activation state of each of these cells plays a critical role in determiningthe outcome of the antitumor immune response. Furthermore, the ability of immunotherapies to alter the activation state provides multiple cell surface markers that are either cell type or activation state specific for the develop-ment of future protein-based targeted molecular imaging agents. Thesemarkers include cell-specific lineage based tracers for the immuno-PET detection of both CTLA-4 and PD-L1 have recently been reported and future development of other agentstargeting the same or similar receptors are expected in the future ( Heskamp et al., 2015; Higashikawa et al., 2014 ). The key challenge for imaging these potential biomarkers in the field of cancer immunotherapy is how their detection will guide clinical decisions. For example, molecular biomarkersthat predict who will respond to or which patients have responded to acertain immunotherapy need to be clinically identified for further develop- ment of molecular imaging agents. Furthermore, these markers may have different utility in predicting or assessing antitumor immune response in dif-ferent malignancies. For example, the presence of cytotoxic CD8 +T cells has had mixed results when used to predict overall survival in breast, lung, ovarian, melanoma, and colorectal cancers ( Gooden, de Bock, Leffers, Nijman, Pages et al., 2010 ).220 M.N. McCracken et al.Other challenges for detecting tumor-infiltrating immune cells are the presence of the antigen sink (ie, spleen and lymph nodes) and how the injected protein dose affects efficient and reproducible tumor-infiltratingimmune cell targeting. The optimal protein dose will be dependent not onlyon the patients' treatment history but also on the type of immunotherapeutictreatment. For example, agonistic CD137 therapy causes the systemic expansion of CD8 T cells but checkpoint inhibitor therapy (anti-PD-1/L1) causes local cytotoxic T cell activation at the site of PD-1/L1 expression.Therefore, the optimal protein dose for sufficient CD8 targeting outside theantigen sink might be different due to the mechanistic differences of the two immunotherapies. Methods to establish the optimal protein dose on a patient-by-patient basis should be established to ensure reproducibletumor-infiltrating immune cell targeting. The importance of proteindose for targeting of CD20 B lymphocytes in the clinic was recently reported for radioimmunotherapy treatment of lymphoma patients ( Muylle et al., 2015 ). The lessons learned from B cell targeting in the clinic are rel- evant to other immune cell targeting, as the principles of antibody-basedradioimmunotherapy targeting are similar to that of immuno-PET targeting. Future directions for immune cell targeting in the field of ACT are the use of cell surface expressed reporter probes as discussed in Section 4.2 . These reporter probes can be targeted not only with an imaging probefor longitudinal cell tracking but also with an intact antibody for the removalof adoptively transferred cells if a patient has adverse reaction to the therapy. Examples of these include a human CD20 mimetic ( Philip et al., 2014 ), the truncated human EGFR ( Wang et al., 2011 ), and the truncated human CEA domain ( Barat et al., 2011; Kenanova et al., 2009 ). One challenge for the clinical development of these cell surface reporter probes will be the epitope density expressed on the cell surface and if the expression is high enough to be detected via immuno-PET. In the future, methods for signal amplifica-tion for molecules that are not highly expressed should be examined. Thedevelopment of advanced pretargeting strategies that enhance radiotracer uptake may help achieve this goal. 6. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE DIRECTION OF PET IMAGING THE ANTITUMOR T CELL RESPONSE Resolution of the PET scanner in both clinical and preclinical appli- cations is approximately the size of lymph nodes. Being close to the limit of detection in scans can cause a partial volume effect due to spatial resolution221 PET Detection of T Cell Responsesin some cases ( Lehnert, Gregoire, Reilhac, & Meikle, 2012 ). This is some- thing for researchers and clinicians to be aware of and account for in their analysis of the data. Although these resolution parameters may not beimproved, the overall sensitivity of the instrument may help in obtaininga scan with less total activity ( Herrmann et al., 2013 ). New microPET scan- ners are significantly more sensitive allowing for reduced probe administra- tion. If these improvements are translated into clinical scanners this will provide a safer and lower dose per patient potentially increasing the numberof scans each patient can receive. Another current limitation in PET is theability to synthesize clinical grade probes. As the popularity and versatility of PET increases we anticipate that a larger number of hospitals and clinicians will setup a means to self-produce or order in the necessary PET probesthrough off-site radiopharmacies. PET is a powerful imaging technology that has immense applications. To date, preclinical applications have shown encouraging data and ways that PET imaging can improve how we monitor immunotherapies. As investi-gators continue to make improvements in protein engineering, probes,reporter genes, and scanners, the applicability of PET imaging to track the antitumor T cell response will move from a research technology to a primary method for monitoring T cell efficacy. These combinatorial imag-ing strategies should greatly enhance our understanding of the antitumorT cell response as well as the overall immune status of the tumor microen-vironment and whole-body providing previously unattainable information.
