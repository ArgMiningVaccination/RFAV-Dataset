Different parts of plant species are used as traditional medicines in the form of crude drugs by variety of doses to cure different ailments and diseases. These species are collected and studied from Khandesh region of the state of Maharashtra and Sahyadri ranges of Western Ghats in India and of them, some species are conserved in our botanical garden for research, multiplication and transfer to other botanical gardens. Keywords:Taxonomy; Medicinal plants; Uses; Traditional medicines Introduction Khandesh is the northern part of Maharashtra State of India. Forest areas of Khandesh includes Satpura Mountain ranges and some offshoots of Western Ghat (Sahyadris)-one of the major hotspots of biodiversity in world. Herbal medicine, also known as herbalism or botanical medicine, is a medical system based on the use of plants or plant extracts that may be eaten or applied to the skin. Since ancient times, herbal medicine has been used by many different cultures throughout the world to treat illness and to assist bodily functions. Herbal medicines are one type of dietary supplement. They are sold as tablets, capsules, powders, teas, extracts, and fresh or dried plants. People use herbal medicines to try to maintain or improve their health. Many people believe that products labeled \"natural\" are always safe and good for them. The use of plants as medicines predates written human history. Archaeological evidence indicates that humans were using medicinal plants during the Paleolithic, approximately 60,000 years ago. The ability to synthesize a wide variety of chemical compounds that are used to perform important biological functions, and to defend against attack from predators such as insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals is called herbal medicine. Many of these phytochemicals have beneficial effects on long-term health when consumed by humans, and can be used to effectively treat human diseases. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total [1-5]. One of the oldest herbs in history is the popular Ginkgo biloba. Fossil records show that Ginkgo has been on earth at least since the Paleozoic period. Egyptians wrote one of the earliest known recorded medical documents around the 1500 BC called Papyrus Ebers. This 20-meter long scroll documents 700 plant-based remedies. A medicinal plant is a plant that has similar properties as conventional pharmaceutical drugs. Humans have used them throughout history to either cure or lessen symptoms from an illness. A pharmaceutical drug is a drug that is produced in a laboratory to cure or help an illness. Medicinal herbs are plants that are used for medicinal purposes. Other types of herbs include culinary herbs, used to flavor food, and aromatic herbs, used to add fragrance. Medicinal herbs cover a wide range of types of plants. They can be annuals or perennials; woody or herbaceous; sun loving or shade requiring. It is likely that humans have used plants as medicine for as long as we have existed. Archeological excavations dated as early as 60,000 years ago have found remains of medicinal plants, such as opium poppies, ephedra, and cannabis. Medicinal plants are considered as a rich resource of ingredients which can be used in drug development either pharmacopoeial, non- pharmacopoeial or synthetic drugs. Some plants and their derivatives are considered as important source for active ingredients which are used in aspirin and toothpaste. Traditional medicine is the sum of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness. A discussion of human life on this planet would not be complete without having look at the role of plants. Many of today's drugs have been derived from plant sources Indigenous people derived medicines from thousands of plants. Plants are well known as a major source of modern medicine. From ancient time, humans have utilized plants for the treatment or prevention of diseases, leading to the dawn of traditional medicine. In recent years there has been reawakened scientific interest in the fundamental role of plants including medicinal purposes [6-10]. Tribal people live close to nature and have accentuated unique knowledge about plant utilization for different purposes through the course of their centuries old experience. Therefore ethnobotanical studies of different tribal localities may lead to find new information on unexploited natural resources and new users of existing resources as sources of medicine, food, dyes, agricultural etc. but at some places recent changes in tribal attitudes due to habitat displacement, deforestation, modernization etc. have led to decline and even disappearance to this rich knowledge system, therefore it is essential to gather their entire knowledge on plant use before losing it forever. Taxonomy identifies and enumerates the components of biological diversity providing basic knowledge underpinning management and implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Ex situ collections are sources of plant material for recovery of threatened or endangered species, habitat rehabilitation and restoration, crop improvement, new product development, and a wide variety of research studies. Conservation of medicinal, endemic and endangered plants can be accomplished by the ex-situ i.e. outside natural habitat by cultivating and maintaining plants in botanic gardens, parks, other suitable sites. Conservation efforts are often focused on a single species. This is usually for the reasons that: some species are key to the functioning of a habitat and their loss would lead to greater than average change in other species populations or ecosystem processes. These are known as keystone species [11-17]. Some of the plants that have become extinct in the wild can still be found in botanic gardens. There is no doubt that ex situ conservation of wild plants in botanic gardens and in situ conservation in nature reserves are of complimentary importance. About 5000 or even more species of flowering plants are endemic to India and these are distributed among 141 genera belonging to 47 families. These species are conserved in the floristically rich areas of North-East India, the Western Ghats, north-west Himalayas and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. These areas constitute two of the 18 hot spots identified in the world. The world's roughly 16200 botanic gardens today contain at least 38000 plant species. The Royal Botanic Gardens of England (Kew England) along contains an estimated 27000 species of plants (10 percent of the world's flora) and International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) considers some 2800 of these species are rare, threatened or endangered. Botanical gardens play a very important role in education, research, even recreation and ex-situ conservation especially those facing imminent threat of extinction. Several gardens in the world are specialized in cultivation and study of medicinal plants, while some contain a special medicinal plant garden or harbor special collection of medicinal plants. I have developed a botanical garden and given emphasis on rare or endangered plants, wild flowers and important economic plants of the regions of Khandesh. Each year more than 5-7 field tours were arranged to investigate and collect wild and medicinal plants. Methodology Frequent field tours were arranged to collect saplings, seeds and rhizomes of highly medicinally plants. Seeds and saplings are cared in nursery for germination and post care. Collected specimens are identified with the help of floras and literature cited in references at the end. Herbarium specimens are prepared for authentication of collected material and housed in the Herbarium of the Department. Following plant species, I could conserve in my botanical garden during last two years in the program by saplings and seeds collected from the forests. I also brought saplings of medicinal plants from nurseries for conservation and education to students. In the following systematic enumeration plant species are arranged alphabetically with their botanical names, followed by family in parentheses. Vernacular names are appended at the ends of botanical names in inverted commas, then it is followed by taxonomy, Occurrence, threats, precise locations, flowering and fruiting period, status and traditional uses.

Results and Discussion Our botanical garden is now well flourished with rare, endangered and medicinal plants. Ex-situ conservation of potential plants with high medicinal value is in full process and are fully grown. In proper season I am frequently going to field tours for collection of seeds, saplings, rhizomes etc. to multiply plants. We have successfully germinated the seeds of Terminalia bellirica (Behda) and about more than hundred saplings prepared and distributed to other botanical gardens of other colleges. My main objectives are 1) To prepare saplings of rare, endangered, endemic and medicinal plants 2) To distribute saplings to different botanical gardens, research institutes and biodiversity parks in India 3) To distribute saplings of medicinal plants to societies locally as social program. Conclusion In the concluding remarks it is stated that in the present research and collective data the uses of plants mentioned as traditional uses are useful in pharmacy, pharmacognosy and related pharmacological researches.
