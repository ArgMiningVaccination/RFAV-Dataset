With a little know-how and the right natural homeopathic remedies, you can boost your body's defenses and put yourself on the road to recovery. What Is a Homeopathic Remedy? Homeopathy takes a natural and holistic approach to medicine. The body is remarkable in its ability to heal itself, but sometimes it needs a helping hand. This is where homeopathic medicine comes in. Homeopathic remedies are formulated from very small amounts of different substances which, despite the small quantities and highly diluted concentrations, are powerful enough to enhance the body's own natural self-regulatory and healing processes. Made from minerals, herbs and other natural substances, homeopathic remedies are effective in restoring balance to your system, which is essential to maintaining your overall health. A New Theory - Like Cures Like In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a German doctor named Samuel Hahnemann developed the practice of homeopathy by positing the theory that like cures like. In other words, he believed it would be possible to treat patients by administering a medicine that produced similar symptoms to the ones caused by the disease itself. In fact, the very word homeopathy is derived from two Greek words meaning \"similar\" and \"disease\" or \"suffering.\" Homeopathy Today Ever since then, people have been using homeopathic remedies to treat a wide range of illnesses, including allergies, atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, sinus infections, irritable bowel syndrome, and many other conditions. Over the past two centuries, homeopathy has made great strides, in popularity as well as in effectiveness. Nowadays, people all over the world use natural remedies to promote health and to deal with a wide variety of ailments. Are Homeopathic Remedies FDA Approved? The FDA recognizes homeopathic remedies as natural treatments according to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. They are safe, for children and pregnant women as well as for normal adults.
