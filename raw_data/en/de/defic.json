Board of Regents Chief of Staff Adam Cavotta read the following resolution aloud: WHEREAS, the authority and responsibility of the Board of Regents to control and manage the New Mexico State University is prescribed by the Constitution of the State of New Mexico, the New Mexico legislature and in state statutes; and WHEREAS, the board delegates to the chancellor its authority for the internal management of the university, and all decisions and actions related thereto, including the authorization to sign co ntracts for the university on behalf of the board of regents; and WHEREAS, the mission of the New Mexico State University system is to serve the diverse needs of the state through comprehensive programs of education, research, extension and outreach, and p ublic service. As the state's land -grant and space -grant university, and as a Hispanic -Serving Institution, NMSU fosters learning, inquiry, diversity and inclusion, social mobility, and service to the broader community; and Binder Page: Page 12 of 810 Special Meeting Minutes for September 2, 2020 Page 3 of 5 Regents of New Mexico State University WHEREAS, the board of regents has been periodically and thoroughly briefed on the terms and conditions of the Master Collaboration Agreement with Sodexo America, LLC; NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED in official session that the Board of Regents of New Mexic o State University supports Chancellor Dan E. Arvizu in his desire to enter into a Master Collaboration Agreement with Sodexo America, LLC to provide Comprehensive Hospitality and Facility Services on behalf of the Board of Regents. RESOLVED, this 2nd day of September 2020, in Las Cruces, New Mexico A motion to adopt the resolution was made by Regent Romero with a second by Regent Devasthali. A roll call vote was taken, and the votes cast were: Regent Romero Yes Regent Hicks Yes Regent Chac\u00f3n -Reitzel Yes Motion passed. D'Anne Stuart and Scott Field presented some background information regarding the Master Collaboration Agreement. Ms. Stuart noted that private public partnerships have been used in higher educ ation for several years , but mostly in response to funding shortfalls and related t o specific areas such as housing and construction projects. In the present case, NMSU started working toward an innovative approach in seeking a third -party collaborator who will realize significant synergies across multiple service lines in alignment with the university's strategic drivers. The process that we entered last year was a very diligent and phased solicitation process and key to that selection process was identify ing a party that could drive value to the institution. As the Chancellor has stated in alignment with our LEADS 2025 and today we're pleased to conclude the RFP process by finalizing the master collaboration agreement with our selected partner Sodex o. Thro ugh this process it's become very apparent that NMSU and Sodexo share similar values and vision. Sodexo will bring global expertise and innovation to the collaboration and help drive a best in class solutions that will address today's needs, especially as we all try to recover from COVID and help equip NMSU for a sustainable tomorrow. Mr. Field further noted that t he MCA is an overarching umbrella agreement and which NMSU and Sodexo agreed to work together to find innovative solution s to achieve N MSU's strategic goals. There are two key aspects to the MCA , the first key aspect of the of the MCA is collaboration . The MCA was designed to align NMSU and Sodexo interest s in achieving NMSU's strategic goals as set forth in L EADS 2025 . This is accomplished by measuring the success of the MCA on the achievement of the LEADS 2025 goals. NMSU and Sodexo have agreed to a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) based on LEADS 2025 , which will be used to measure the success of the overall collaboration. The second key aspect of the MCA is scope. The mission of the NMSU system is to serve the diverse needs of the state of New Mexico through comprehensive programs of education , research , extension and outreach , and public service. The MCA covers University operations that fall outside those key functions. Each of the covered University operations will be examined to determine whether it fits within the scope of the collaboration. Separate implementation agreements under the umbrella of the MCA will be negotiated for each university operation that NMSU and Sodexo agree could benefit from the collaboration. Binder Page: Page 13 of 810 Special Meeting Minutes for September 2, 2020 Page 4 of 5 Regents of New Mexico State University Each implementation agreement will also include KPIs . The implementation level KPIs will be more operational in nature than the MCA level KPIs. But these KPIs will als o be designed to help achieve NMSU's LEADS 2025 goals . Chancellor Arvizu thanked the board of regents for their support of this project . Chancellor Arvizu noted that the project has tremendous potential and every stakeholder that he's talked to has given an enthusiastic reception to the concept and to the idea that we're trying to be innovative and creative. The board's support is extremely valuable and very important . Every one of the projects will be subjected to a due diligence process and when necessary will come back to the board of regents for either leasing arrangements or for other matters . Ms. Stuart continued and noted that this collaboration structure is t he key to success of this relationship. It's unique to this agreement, in that it establishes the commitment by both parties at all levels of the organization. This structure will break down silos within our own organization and drive s integrated solutions and ensure s effective decision making. The MCA ser ves as the foundation for all future initiatives as the Chancellor just mentioned. U pon signing the agreement we roll up our sleeves and get to work. Together, we will determine the path forward by reevaluating our priorities based on COVID and our budget situation. E ach initiative will be evaluated following a process that is outlined in the MCA. As we decide to implement any initiative those changes will be approved and communicated through the collaboration structure or will come forward to the board as needed. This approach and model have the potential to be transformative, not only to NMSU you but to the P3 industry . NMSU , in collaboration with Sodexo , look forward to leading such an effort t ogether . We will be bold and together we will shape the future . Chairwoman Chac\u00f3n -Reitzel thanked those that presented and commended the approach as the university faces new challenges. Regent Hicks noted that as we move forward, each one of these projects will be evaluated for KPIs , noting that there's nearly 20 different key KPIs. This is a solution that members of the board have been looking forward to for a few years now. Regent Hicks expressed her excite ment about the opportunities that it presents to the students of New Mexico State University as well as our faculty and staff that are working on our campus. I t's a huge opportunity , it's a collaboration between us and obviously a very large company and we have big ideas and many of them are going to come to fruition in the next few years. It's a very exciting time as we work with Sodexo in a collaborative way in order to find solutions to what we need to have to meet our students needs in this world as we move forward. Regent Romero thanked everyone that had a part in making this a reality , from the Regents to the President's office , to the to the Chancellor's office to everyone that was part of this. It is groundbreaking, first of its kind. The potential that this could have as a result to how it's going to improve the NMSU community, the solutions that it's going to be able to create to help us move forward. Regent Romero noted that the reason that he believes this is how it is going to positively affect the students, our faculty and our staff in the future , including both short term and long -term benefits. Regent Devasthali added her appreciation to all the hard work that has gone into the agreement and is particularly excited that we have decided to have this partnership with Sodexo because it's a known entity and they have served us well in the past. Regent Devasthali noted that many people have worked very hard on this agreement, but specifically thanked Ruth . Scott, and D'Anne , noting that they have been putting a lot of work and a lot of due diligence into the process. Regent Sanchez noted is excite ment at the potential of this collaboration to provide and continue to provide high quality education for students and he reflected on his own experience and s ees some of the research Binder Page: Page 14 of 810 Special Meeting Minutes for September 2, 2020 Page 5 of 5 Regents of New Mexico State University opportunities and experiential learning opportunities he had in the classroom to develop and this collaboration can enable NMS U to continue to provide those for students and provide more experiences in and out of the classroom.

This investigation has been completed and no evidence of data theft or misuse of information has been found. The Foundation has confirmed that the affected computers did not contain credit card or bank account data, social security numbers, or other personal identifying information as defined by the New Mexico Data Breach Notification Act . The Foundation is taking a comprehensive approach to protecting confidential data and reduc ing the risk of disruptive data security events moving forward . In addition to making technical modifications, the Foundation is also issuing risk management guidance, training, and compliance testing for our staff . 5. Giving Tuesday (December 1, 2020) Giving Tuesday 2020 will be held on December 1st. This annual day of giving will be held on NMSU's official crowdfunding site - Make A Statement.

With 68% of NMSU Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) graduates staying in New Mexico in 2019, the NMSU BSN program is a critical part of the solution to the state's critical nursing workforce needs. Graduating qualified nurses during a pandemic is especially important, as nurses are the vital link between the patient and the rest of the health care team. The NMSU nursing program collaborates with its higher education partners across the state to deliver a common curriculum that allows nursing students to easily move from community college to university level courses. In addition to the Las Cruces campus, NMSU delivers the BSN program to students at the NMSU-Alamogordo and NMSU-Grants campuses, meeting critical workforce needs in those communities. BSN program enrollment is limited by: 1) the number of qualified faculty and 2) laboratory space available for clinical skills instruction and training. The School of Nursing is requesting an increase in funding to 1) support enrollment growth, 2) enhance pre-nursing student support services to increase the pipeline of qualified applicants to the BSN program, 3) extra laboratory equipment and personal protection supplies to meet our COVID-19 safety protocols, and 4) a simulation technician for the Nursing Skills and Simulation Center to bring the staffing levels up to national standards and other facilities in the state. The College of Health & Social Services obtained a $400,000 donation from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico for nursing student scholarships and a 3-year Professor of Practice position for a nursing faculty.

The institute is now operationalizing critical work begun in FY15 to develop a Statewide Water Assessment that complements the existing state's tabulations every five years of water use attached to water rights. A version of the New Mexico Dynamic Statewide Water Budget (NMDSWB) model is available on the NM WRRI website. The model synthesizes water supply and demand information; provides easy to access data at a variety of spatial scales (county and/or water planning regions); produces a holistic view of water resources and user-defined future scenarios; and supports local, regional, and statewide water planning. State funding has also funded: faculty and student water research grants statewide; coordination and data acquisition to obtain, process, synthesize, and deliver data; and improved water management through enhanced water use estimates in agricultural areas starting with the Lower Rio Grande. Continued funding will support the Community Hydrology Program that funds research on NM surface water-groundwater interactions in communities of the Upper Rio Grande, the Estancia Basin, the Lower Rio Grande, and other critical sites. In FY20, NM WRRI began a new initiative, New Mexico Universities Produced Water Synthesis Project (NMUPWSP), leading the effort on produced water assessment, water and energy analysis, and spatial systems modeling with considerations of treatment and transportation costs, reuse applications, municipal supplies, and water agreements.1,064.0$ 1,064.0$ - $ Binder Page: Page 52 Sp.

New Mexico's agricultural industry provides nearly $3 billion to the state's economy, second only to the gas and oil industries. Most of New Mexico's agricultural products, however, are shipped out of state for processing before returning to New Mexico as consumer-available products. Processors in other states are profiting from New Mexico's agricultural producers and the lack of extensive value-added industries in New Mexico agriculture. In order to build a vibrant and sustainable food and agricultural industry in New Mexico, state-of-the-art value-added industries must be developed. New Mexico State University, a Hispanic-serving, high-research-activity, land-grant university located 60 miles from the border between the United States and Mexico, is uniquely positioned and equipped to meet the pressing needs of value-added agricultural industries. Another goal of the Center is the development of sustainable food supply chains and the reduction/elimination of food deserts currently occurring in the state.

Delays in diagnostic evaluation impact a family's ability to access ASD intervention services. Access to these services is crucial, as early intervention results in improved outcomes. In New Mexico, current wait times for families seeking an ASD evaluation are among some of the longest in the nation and range from nine to 24 months. Until now, the state has operated with only one diagnostic center located at UNM's Center for Development and Disability (CDD) in Albuquerque. Given the rise in the incidence of ASD and long wait times to access diagnostic services, one center is not sufficient to meet the needs of the state.

For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. Some major accomplishments for AES are listed below. Decreased funding resulting from unfunded mandates, increased salaries, increased utility costs, and increased administrative costs are the biggest obstacles to success. Disruption and scaling back of research activities due to the COVID- 19 Pandemic response has curtailed current research programs and the anticipated scope of accomplishments. Soil degradation has been a significant challenge for sustainable crop production in semiarid regions. Croplands in the region have lost more than 50% of soil organic matter and nutrients in the past century, leading to degradation in soil health and resilience. Cover cropping and cropping system diversification research at the Agricultural Science Center -Clovis revealed an increase in soil organic matter by 18- 20% and microbial community size by 41% with cover crop integration than without a cover crop. In the long -term, cover cropping has the potential to improve soil health, restore degraded lands, and support the rural economy in the semiarid western US. Increasing growth performance and the immune response of newly received feedlot calves in an important way to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with bovine respiratory disease ( BRD). More than 25% of beef cattle placed in feedlots are affected by BRD. Estimated antimicrobial treatment per animal is approximately $23.60 with a success risk of 71%. Research reducing morbidity and mortality is significant regionally and nationally f or producers, feed yards, and consumers. Preliminary statistical analysis of data collected at the NMSU Clayton Livestock Research Center has shown that antimicrobial metaphylaxis therapy is effective to reduce illness and numbers of treatments required fo r BRD control. Conservation agriculture targeting limited irrigation strategies improves crop water productivity across the Southwestern US. NMSU preliminary results show a water -saving of about 25% of seasonal irrigation amount while maintaining crop yield. The extrapolation of this study into the farmers' field targeting the Navajo Agricultural Product Industry (NAPI), with more than 72,000 acres developed, could help in increasing the actual capacity to irrigate additional 15,000- 18,000 acres of the 35,000 acres that can be potentially developed by NAPI. Soil moisture sensors help optimize irrigation management and improving water conservation. Groundwater is needed for agriculture and is becoming scarce in the Permian Basin where produced water (P W) is extracted with oil, but poor water quality impedes the use of PW. Characterizing PW compositional variability is needed to evaluate environmental impact, treatment, and reuse potential. Both energy and food production sustainability are required for our industries and population, especially when they are both located in desert areas.

For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. PW salinity decreased with further increases in depth. Contour maps of salinity illustrate spatial variability across Permian Basin, which suggests that upon treatment PW would support some beneficial uses, such as onsite reuse and mining. The Sustainable Agriculture Science Center at Alcalde is evaluating jujube (Chinese date) as a new fruit crop for New Mexic o. Jujubes are a hig h-value crop that can be relied on to produce fruit every year due to its late flowering cycle. Jujubes contain several antioxidants and have a vitamin C content several times high than oranges. SASC imported 30+ cultivars from China and have collected cultivars across the U.S. for testing. Research is being shared with farmers on growing, flowering, and fruiting habits, along with pruning and other care techniques. Newer jujube cultivars will increase yield and revenue by $1 -2 per pound. Farming practic es that involve leaving soil unsown for extended periods (9 -13 months) can raise aridity, reduce soil fertility and with heavy winds can increase soil erosion (23.64 tons/acre). This practice costs the state more than $31.00 per acre annually. Cover croppi ng enhances soil health by reducing erosion, weed density, soil compaction, and increasing soil organic matter, water retention, and nitrogen. However, because of the high cost of cover cropping, growers are reluctant to adopt the technology. An NMSU study shows that a $50.00/acre subsidy through the 'Healthy Soil Program' would make cover cropping profitable and enhance sustainability. Roundup- resistant redroot pigweed is becoming a troublesome weed in corn -producing areas and growers are having a hard time controlling it in their fields. Several studies are being conducted at the Agricultural Science Center in Clovis, NM, to evaluate redroot pigweed control and corn response to several herbicides other than glyphosate. Results showed excellent pigweed c ontrol using pre -plant followed by post -emergence herbicides applied ear ly in the season. Also , corn yield losses due to pigweed competition were reduced by 90 %. Corn growers in the Clovis area are using this information to increase their income and reduc e pigweed infestation in their fields. New Mexico is known for producing specialty peanuts, i.e., Valencia type (3 -4 seeded pods, red skin, sweet taste, and good flavor). New Mexico's peanut industry exists largely due to research at the Agricultural Science Center at Clovis. Valencia A and Valencia C peanuts, which were developed there, account for 70 percent of the peanuts grown in New Mexico. A new high oleic peanut cultivar NuMex -01 released in 2014 is gaining popularity among growers due to high yie ld and extended shelf life. New Mexico's peanut production is valued over $8 million annually. The research contributes to continued improvements in peanut production through investigations of fertility, inoculants, disease resistance and water management practices. In 2019, advanced cultivars released by the NMSU peanut breeding program accounts for 20% of the total acreage that was cultivated in New Mexico and West Texas regions. Certain water supplies in Eastern New Mexico dairies have been contaminat ed with Perfluoroctane Sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acids (PFOA), which are used as fire retardants. These contaminants can infiltrate milk and meat in the livestock consuming water and feed contaminated with this organic chemical. Producers with contaminated cattle are unable to market their products for 365 days. NMSU researchers, in conjunction with several government agencies, are determining how long it takes for tissue concentrations of PFOS/PFOA to decline below allowable levels. Studies fo und that tissue levels fell below regulatory levels much sooner than originally thought and completed the project four months early. This work will provide government agencies information needed to determine how long a producer must hold animals before products can be marketed. Onion, the third most consumed vegetable in the U.S., is grown on 125,000 acres across at least 20 states. Per capita consumption of onions is about 20 pounds per year, having increased 70% over the past 20 years. Onion has a U.S. farm- gate value of nearly $1 billion/year and over $70 million in added value after processing. More than 20% of the world's onion seed (>$100 million/year value), is produced in the U.S., mostly in California, Colorado, Georgia, New Mexico, New York, Ore gon, Texas, and Washington. NMSU researchers participate in a multistate project, with 12 U.S, universities, USDA, and private industries in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand to develop management strategies to protect this valuable crop (New Mex ico produces about 50% of the U.S. fresh market onions in June and July) from diseases and insect pests.

For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. Being able to use mechanical harvesters will greatly assist the NM chile industry compete with foreign producers who have lower labor costs . Researchers are working with private growers to accelerate chile pepper cultivar development and advancement of green chile mechanization, as well as continuing breeding efforts in high quality paprika cultivars and open pollinated cayenne peppers with mec hanical harvest traits. 7.Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? AES is a constitutional and statutory program supporting the agricultural and community needs of New Mexicans. The mission and breadth of personnel and facilities make state -wide impact a natural result of research and programs. The A ES conducts research and discovery addressing real -world problems designed to increase economic and community developm ent by responding to research needs identified by advisory boards and stakeholders. The research efforts in AES provide a major source of hands -on learning opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students while addressing the needs of the agricultural communities throughout the state. Notable statewide impacts include: the establishment, expansion, and improvement of the chile industry; support of the pecan industry; establishment of the niche onion industry that account for 50% of the fresh market o nions in the U.S. during June and July; extensive support of improved cotton varieties; development of the wool squeezing machine; and characterization of cattle health and diet regimes, both in feedlots and on rangeland. Impacts from current research prog rams include: increased conservation and efficient use of freshwater, along with adaptive use of marginal waters; using nutritional data as preventative medicine for human health and wellness; development of biofuels from oilseed crops; improved rangeland and other natural resources management of lives tock and wildlife; agricultural and food security; resolutions of social and economic disruptions between urban and rural communities, including attracting retirees to NM. 8.Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you so ught out funding from other sources? AES scientists have been effective at leveraging these monies to help secure grant funding and awards from numerous federal, state, and private sources. Federal appropriations for FY19 total $2,362,573. In FY19, AES submitted over $75 million in grant proposals and had research expenditures totaling $13,342,247. In addition, AES receives donations and in- kind contri butions that facilitate research but are not considered part of the overall budget. For every state dollar invested over the past 10 years AES scientists have averaged over $1 in grant funding. 9.Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) Additional Accomplishments, impacts and highlights Crops that are critical to New Mexico's economy, such as the world -famous green chile from Hatch, rely heavily on groundwater during drought. Groundwater and surface water can become disconnected as groundwater table drops, which limits infiltration. NMSU, in conjunction with the Elephant Butte Irrigation District, discovered that the 2010- 2017 drought caused a transition to disconnection within parts of the watershed where Hatch is located, and they confirmed the reversibility of this disconnection by study period end. The method developed can monitor these hydrolog ic transitions overreach to basin scales. Plant growth regulators (PGR) and soil surfactants are commonly used for golf course maintenance. NMSU research has documented that the combination of the PGR Trinexapac -ethyl and the soil surfactant Revolution, reduces irrigation requirements while maintaining higher turf quality. In a follow -up study, further testing will identify the impact of five different PGRs applied separately or in combination with the soil surfactant Revolution at two irrigation levels on bermudagrass quality. The overall goal is to identify the most effective treatment combination to help golf course superintendents save up to 25% of the irrigation water they currently use. Binder Page: Page 65 of 8109. Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) is a significant health concern in the cattle industry, affecting more than 20% of cattle and costing the US beef industry more than $600 million per year. Typically, metaphylactic antibiotic use is employed to prevent feedlot calves from succumbing to BRD. However, consumer pressure to minimize antibiotic use in food -producing animals demands exploration of alternative strategies to prevent BRD and improve animal health. An NMSU researcher is studying to find if nutritional strategies utilizing specific nutraceuticals can be deve loped to increase immunity and reduce BRD in cattle by 5% annually; this could save the US beef industry more than $30 million annually. Identifying alternate crops that can grow with minimum irrigation water, reduce inputs, improve soil quality, and al so provide economically sustainable returns to the growers of the region is important. Research at NMSU has shown that guar can be successfully grown in New Mexico conditions and can help reduce reliance on imports (estimated US guar imports in 2012 are $1 billion) to meet the needs of the US gas and oil industry. Cover crop research has provided cover crop options that can be integrated into organic or conventional cropping systems by local growers to meet their sustainability goals. Wind erosion and dust impact agricultural production, air quality, human health, water cycle, biogeochemical cycles, and climate. Land use and climate change potentially increase erosion rates and fine dust emissions. NMSU researchers have developed approaches to use data fr om national ecological monitoring programs with models to establish benchmark erosion rates for soils that can be used to assess the effectiveness of conservation practices. The research enables soil erosion and air quality to be evaluated in land use plans alongside other indicators of land health. Invasive plants cause costly problems for agriculture and natural resource management. The perennial Lehmann lovegrass was introduced to the Southwest in the 1930s to restore overgrazed rangeland soils. It sp read across Arizona and recently began displacing native grasses in New Mexico. Much research exists on aboveground traits enabling competitive dominance over native plants. Little is known though, about belowground properties, or how rhizosphere microbes may promote or inhibit lovegrass proliferation. Using next -generation sequencing we identified indicator taxa in lovegrass root microbiomes that potentially benefit or harm these plants. Such taxa may lead to soil microbial amendments transforming invasive plant management. Often considered an indicator of wider ecosystem health, the burrowing owl faces conservation concerns with growing urban areas. NMSU researchers are working collaboratively with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Global Owl Pro ject to evaluate and improve translocation efforts for this bird. Their research will improve abilities to successfully move the o wls away from development and provide a standard protocol nationwide. One of the major challenges facing New Mexico and the Southwestern U.S. in the 21st century is coping with water insecurity and the coordinated scientific effort that will be required to meet food and freshwater demands. Agriculture must take a lead role in achieving sustainable water use. Microirrigation is just one of many efficient irrigation and water management technology tools that can successfully address the water insecurity issue, but it is a tool that has several advantages. Microirrigation can reduce water waste and the transport of contaminants to surface water and groundwater. Irrigation events can be fine -tuned to spoon- feed water and nutrients just in time to avoid plant stress. Microirrigation can optimize crop water productivity (more crop per drop) and in many cases increase the quality of agricultural products. NMSU researchers work with a multistate research project (more than 17 universities, and 4 USDA laboratories) to refine and adapt these technologies for the benefit of New Mexico farmers.

Shape the Future. Actual: MISSION of NMSU's Cooperative Extension Service (CES) is to deliver practical, research -based knowledge and programs that improve New Mexicans' quality of life. A part of NMSU's College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, CES is a unique federal, state, and county partnership. FOOD & FIBER PRODUCTION AND MARKETING Trichomoniasis, a venereal disease of cattle, is known to reduce herd fertility resulting in devastating economic impacts. Since 2006, NMSU ACES CES has coordinated 130 Trichomoniasis control programs centered on producer education. As of date, less than 2% of 13,526 bulls tested positive for the disease. Extension targeted outreach and training have been successful in lowering the cases of Trichomoniasis. NMSU ACES CES partnered with the Southwest Border Food Protection and Emergency Preparedness Center, NMSU School of Public Health, NM Farm Bureau and NMDA to provide information to frontline workers in agriculture. The collaboration developed the \"Essential Produce Worker Protocol\" to assist produce farmers with OSHA and CDC guidelines for agriculture workers. NMSU ACES CES and the NMDA developed extension articles addressing the needs of NM growers while working closely with the NM Livestock Board to provide online producer education. NMSU ACES CES professionals across the state assisted local food banks with volunteer support and donation gardens. In addition, due to the shortage of seed supplies, NMSU Master Gardeners coordinated a tomato plant distribution program providing at least 2,000 plants across the state. ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP Large and severe wildfires threaten lives, property, wildlife habitat, and watersheds. One way to mitigate wildfire threats is to use prescribed fire. Since 2014, NMSU Extension has trained 83 practitioners and conducted 6 training burns on 700 acres of private ranches. The forestry and fire research program provide managers with a demonstration area with over 10 years of data showing how thinning and burning treatments build forest resilience to insects, disease and wildfire. Annually, wildlife is responsible for greater than $1 billion in agricultural production losses and $25 billion in losses to homes, businesses and municipalities, nationwide. NMSU ACES CES trains urban and rural New Mexicans to safely and effectively address wildlife damage issues in their homes, gardens, ranches, farms and communities using environmentally responsible methods. CES Programs Selected Accomplishments and Impact Statements Binder Page: Page 75 of 810RPSP Name Here FAMILY DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH OF NEW MEXICANS According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes and prediabetes cost an estimated $2 billion in New Mexico each year. Approximately 241,120 people in New Mexico, or 14% of the population, have diabetes. In addition, a reported 25% of children and teens are overweight. NMSU ACES CES partnered with HealthInsight to offer the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) an evidence -based, lifestyle intervention program facilitated by a trained lifestyle coach through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NDPP is a free year -long lifestyle change program for people with pre -diabetes or having risk factors for developing diabetes. CES reaches more than 200,000 citizens annually through workshops on nutrition, parenting, and physical fitness. CES Nutrition Education Program participants improved nutrition practices by 86%, diet quality by 75%, physical activity by 69%, and saved the state $10 million in health- related expenses. Ideas for Cooking and Nutrition (ICAN) is a NMSU ACES CES program funded by USDA's EFNEP and SNAP -Ed grants to provide nutrition education to limited -resource audiences in New Mexico. ICAN's mission is to inspire New Mexico's limited -resource families to make healthy food and lifestyle choices. In 2019, ICAN reached 105,000 adults and children across New Mexico, delivering face -to-face cooking demonstrations and nutrition education at over 350 locations statewide. After taking ICAN classes, 91% of adults make healthier food choices; 59% of children handle food more safely; and 70% of families conserve more food resources by cooking at home and planning before they shop. ICAN collaborates with 45 partner organizations to provide statewide education. Program staff and partners also visited 122schools and youth organizations to deliver nutrition education to New Mexico's children. ICAN saves New Mexicans an estimated 10 million dollars by reducing future healthcare costs each year. The COVID -19 pandemic has many people experiencing a significant amount of stress. To help with this, NMSU ACES CES created a statewide stress management web series. Stress Management: Thriving in Today's Demanding World provided information on resiliency, impacts of stress on the brain and body, positivity, and self-care. NMSU ACES CES developed Financially Navigating the COVID -19 Outbreak, afour-part online series focused on financial assistance and guidance for individuals and families. The series highlighted the financial impacts of COVID -19 to the average household/family, how to access state and federal stimulus and emergency funds, and how to create a spending plan to maximize current income and savings.YOUTH DEVELOPMENT The NMSU ACES CES Youth Ranch Management Camp was designed to address the decline in students preparing for careers in the agricultural industry. Hosted at the CS Ranch in Cimarron, NM the camp encourages career exploration through a series of week -long experiential learning opportunities. CES specialists, agriculture agents, and ranchers in the industry have provided instruction to over 237 students. While youth across the state are engaging online with their teachers, NMSU ACES CES 4-H Agents have been actively involved in maintaining programming across the state with the 33,000 enrolled members. 4 -H has an educational focus on STEM, healthy living, citizenship, and leadership.

The series highlighted the financial impacts of COVID - 19 to the average household/family, how to access state and federal stimulus and emergency funds, and how to create a spending plan to maximize current income and savings. 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? Additional funding sources include County funding, Federal funding and Grants and Contracts. 9. Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) Trichomoniasis, a venereal disease of cattle, is known to reduce herd fertility resulting in devastating economic impacts. Since 2006, NMSU ACES CES has coordinated 130 Trichomoniasis control programs centered on producer education. As of date, less than 2% of the 13,526 bulls tested showed positive for the disease. Extension targeted outreach and training have been successful in lowering the cases of Trichomoniasis. Profitability is a growing concern for cattle producers in New Mexico. New Mexico's gross income from cattle and calves is down from previous years. The inventory value of all cattle and calves is also on the decline. NMSU CES developed cattle producer programs designed to address the concerns of profitability by cattle producers. New Mexico has the second -highest average age of producers in the U.S. (59.8), second only to Hawaii. As the next generation of farmers and ranchers take ownership of New Mexic o farms, increasing their business and financial acumen is imperative to the maintenance and growth of the NM agricultural industry and economy. NMSU ACES Department of Extension Economics has proposed an Agriculture Transition Planning Initiative to suppo rt farm transition. The NMSU ACES CES Youth Ranch Management Camp was designed to address the decline in students preparing for careers in the agricultural industry. Hosted at the CS Ranch in Cimarron, NM , the camp encourages career exploration through a series of week -long experiential learning opportunities. CES specialists, agriculture agents, and ranchers in the industry have provided instruction to over 237 students. New Mexico is experiencing increasing interest in aquaponics across the state. Aq uaponics are particularly suited for arid environments. In response, NMSU CES provides an overview of aquaponics, information on fish and plant culture, water quality, as well as food safety through workshops. All program participants intend to implement a t least one practice. NMSU ACES CES recognizes the struggles of many in our community to provide adequate resources for children and families. CES Fit Families, a preventative education program, provides basic nutrition, physical activity, social - emotion al well- being, and hands -on cooking demos to families seeking to lead a healthier lifestyle. In 2019, classes were delivered in Southern New Mexico to 45 families, 122 adults and children. Familias En Forma, a Spanish curriculum, was also delivered in unde rserved Spanish -speaking communities. The partnership has allowed Fit Families to connect with various organizations, leading to recruitment opportunities, an increase in program awareness, and continued collaboration. When parents are depressed, mentally stressed or thinking about suicide, their families suffer - which can result in poor mental health among children. New Mexico is the second most stressed- out state with family -related stress causing some of the most significant problems. In efforts to reduce stress, NMSU ACES CES offers Resilient Mothers, Resilient Children , a program designed to reduce the incidence of stress and mental illness in southern New Mexico. Binder Page: Page 79 of 8109. Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) The program also aims to improve positive relationships between mothers and their child ren. Programs were delivered to diverse audiences including three classes in Spanish, one located on the Holloman Air Force Base, and another specifically for Native American women. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes and prediabete s cost an estimated $2 billion in New Mexico each year. Approximately 241,120 people in New Mexico, or 14% of the population, have diabetes. In addition, 603,000 New Mexicans, 40% of the adult population, have prediabetes with blood glucose levels higher than normal but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. Moreover, a reported 25% of children and teens are overweight. NMSU ACES CES partnered with HealthInsight to offer the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) in 12 counties over a 5- year period. NDPP is an evidence -based, lifestyle intervention program facilitated by a trained lifestyle coach through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NDPP is a free year -long lifestyle change program for people with pre -diabetes or having ri sk factors for developing diabetes. CES reaches more than 200,000 citizens annually through workshops on nutrition, parenting, and physical fitness. CES Nutrition Education Program participants improved nutrition practices by 86%, diet quality by 75%, physical activity by 69%, and saved the state $10 million in health -related expenses. Ideas for Cooking and Nutrition (ICAN) is a NMSU ACES CES program funded by USDA's EFNEP and SNAP -Ed grants to provide nutrition education to limited -resource audiences in New Mexico. ICAN's mission is to inspire New Mexico's limited -resource families to make healthy food and lifestyle choices. In 2019, ICAN reached 105,000 adults and children across New Mexico, delivering face -to-face cooking demonstrations and nutrition e ducation at over 350 locations statewide. After taking ICAN classes, 91% of adults make healthier food choices; 59% of children handle food more safely; and 70% of families conserve more food resources by cooking at home and planning before they shop. ICA N collaborates with 45 partner organizations to provide statewide education. Program staff and partners also visited 122 schools and youth organizations to deliver nutrition education to New Mexico's children. ICAN saves New Mexicans an estimated 10 millio n dollars by reducing future healthcare costs each year. ICAN's Seed to Supper program spans all 33 counties reaching over 1500 residents. The program also partners with Master Gardeners to distribute seeds and outreach across the state. In addition, Seed to Supper offers a link to download program materials to serve as a standalone resource for interested residents. The primary cause of financial stress in New Mexico is debt. Low credit score, debt, and spending are major problems, especially for famili es with limited resources. \"How to Get a $500 Per Month Raise without Asking Your Boss\" explores how to save money and add it to your monthly cash flow. The workshop offers tools to improve credit scores and pay off debt. Mindfulness and behavioral economics are used to help participants reflect on current and future financial situations. Annually, wildlife is responsible for greater than $1 billion in agricultural production losses and $25 billion in losses to homes, businesses and municipalities, nationwide. NMSU ACES CES trains urban and rural New Mexicans to safely and effectively address wildlife damage issues in their homes, gardens, ranches, farms and communities using environmentally responsible methods. Large and severe wildfires threaten lives, property, wildlife habitat, and watersheds. One way to mitigate wildfire threats is to use prescribed fire. Since 2014, NMSU Extension has trained 83 practitioners and conducted 6 training burns on 700 acres of private ranches. The forestry and fire res earch program provide managers with a demonstration area with over 10 years of data showing how thinning and burning treatments build forest resilience to insects, disease and wildfire.

Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) NMSU ACES CES Innovative Media Research and Extension developed the \"Because I Care, I Wash My Hands\" series in collaboration with Michigan State University. The partnership hosts a collection of online songs, games, and science experiments for kids. The music videos in the YouTube series \"Because I Care, I Wash My Ha nds\" have been watched more than 1.4 million times since March 2020. The sudden and rapid spread of Covid -19 left many people, including teenagers, wondering how to overcome the outbreak. Outbreak Squad, an online game, was developed by the NMSU ACES CES Innovative Media Research and Extension. The game has been played almost 3,000 times since the Covid -19 outbreak. The game demonstrates how professionals in healthcare, research, enforcement and education must work together it they hope to stop deadly outb reaks and pandemics. The game was developed through a collaboration between NMSU and the University of Tennessee, with funding from USDA -NIFA. Medical Projects 10.

For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the cu rrent FY. Major Accomplishments: New Mexico Department of Agriculture began issuing hemp production licenses for the 2019 growing season. As expected, there was a significant amount of interest from New Mexicans to grow hemp with growers producing in 31 of the state's 33 counties, over 7,000 acres licensed to 300 outdoor growers, and approximately 4 million square feet licensed for indoor production. New Mexico hemp growers have taking a cautious approach to production for the 2020 growing season. Appr oximately 1,700 outdoor acres are currently licensed (June 20, 2020) in 25 counties, and approximately 3.8 million square feet of indoor production. Challenges: Nationally, the hemp industry continues to wait for FDA to rule on regulatory status of hemp extracts. Without clarity from FDA, the major industries that will incorporate hemp extracts into the larger markets continue to refrain from marketing their CBD products. 7. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? Initiating hemp production for 2019 provided the state a one year advantage over Texas and Arizona with respect to attracting out- of-state investments for production as well as processing facilities. The progressive approach of the state meets the Governor's initiatives for economic development while adding to the initiative for Value added agriculture. Binder Page: Page 95 of 8107. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? During the 2019 harvest, the nation's hemp industry experienced its translation from a niche crop to a more mainstream agricultural commodity. Along with that transition came the growing pains, including limitations on processing, uncertainties within lending institutions, and continued delays in regulatory clarity from FDA that all contri buted to post -harvest bottlenecks within the industry and lower -than -expected prices for raw products. 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? NMDA receives federal grants and continues to seek out funding from other sources. Currently NMDA is working on programs funded by: 1. United States Department of Agriculture/Wildlife Services 2. United States Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Marketing Service 3. United States Department of Agriculture/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 4.

Project Description / Executive Summary : New Mexico State University (NMSU), as a leading institute of higher learning , provides an enhanced college experience by maintaining Division One FBS status of its athletic program. As the front porch to the land grant institution for the state o f New Mexico, NMSU Athletics provides a well -rounded and quality educational opportunit y for students of diverse backgrounds and athletic ability. The Division One status also offers its faculty, staff, alumni, and the community a unique opportunity to be a part of a Division One athletics program at a premier institution. NMSU Intercollegia te Athletics strives to be a premier Football Bowl Subdivision (Division 1 A) athletics program.

Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) NMSU Athletics continues to manage its financial situation. In doing so, the department has maintained its commitment to provide operating funds to its 16 sponsored sports. However, the cost of doing business has increased and these higher costs Binder Page: Page 113 of 8103. Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) are being passed on from our vendors, resulting in fewer resources for our teams. Travel, student housing and meals, athletic supplies and equipment, medical services and insurance, have continued to be the areas of greater need. NMSU teams must travel via airplane to most competition sites whereas other universities' athletics programs are within driving distance to competitions. These increased costs, along with our geographic location have continued to place a strain on our coaches and staff and have been consiste nt major challenges in managing costs. Part of recruiting and commitment to our student -athletes is the level of competition we provide them. Maintaining appropriate funding is necessary to allow the programs the opportunity to continue to meet obligations and provide a positive, safe and well -rounded experience for the students participating as athletes. Should any level of funding be further reduced from the current level, NMSU athletic programs face multiple negative impacts including: member institutions classified as FBS to fund their athletic programs at minimum levels including adherence to the Division One philosophy, financial aid, scheduling of athletic contests and sports sponsorship. We continue to make strides i n positioning ourselves for the future and towards meeting gender equity and Title IX requirements. NMSU Athletics will continue to improve academically and competitively and give back through serving the community. We remain committed to contributing to the \"discovery\" potentia l of each and every student -athlete. 4.

Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): The program is designed to meet the needs of traditional and non -traditional students from Southeastern New Mexico. The students are introduced to the skills related to industries such as building trades, welding, industrial maintenance, oil and gas preparation, and automotive repair and are able to earn certification in those fields of study. The programs provide the opportunity f or non -traditional students and individuals who have lost their jobs to be retrained in other career fields. 5. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) The project will provide trained professionals prepared to wor k in the potash industry. The Industrial Maintenance Technician program is the only degree of its kind in New Mexico and the degree was developed in direct collaboration with Intrepid and Mosaic potash. Recently, this program completed the applicatio n process and was granted apprenticeship certification through the state. Also, at risk students both in high school and college will be provided opportunities to learn the essential skills related to demand trades. Trained welders are in extreme deman d in southeastern New Mexico and Carlsbad and Eddy County are experiencing housing shortages. The MSDP program will include funding requests to increase the number of welding professionals and also to implement a testing facility whereby local welders can complete their welding tests to meet state requirements. The building trades program has completed nine houses and they have begun work on the tenth house. The prior nine houses were sold at rates based upon the candidate's affordability. 6. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. Major accomplishments include the completion of an affordable h ouse built by students which will be offered to needy citizens at a rate they could afford. Also, the welding program was able to initiate an industry approved welding test initi ative which allowed area welders to complete a test weld to see if they met i ndustry stipulations. Finally, the program allowed students to attain entry level skills for the potash and the oil and gas industries. 7. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes?

Shape the Future. $102,400 FY allow NMSU Carlsbad to continue offering student nurses the best possible education experience. New Mexico continues to experience a severe nursing shortage and it is imperative that colleges and universities provide a well prepared and competent cadre of nurses each year that are ready to move into the workforce and fulfill healthcare needs. The salaries earned by these nurses make a significant contribution to the City of Carlsbad, Eddy County as well as the New Mexico economy. NMSU Carlsbad is dedicated to ensuring that our nursing curricula are the epitome of best practices and that nurses are appropriately trained and prepared for the National Council Licensure Examination. To this end, nursing expansion funds have been dedicated to the payment of some nursing salaries at the high school level to recruit and introduce nursing program offerings to students in high school and dual credit programs. Additionally, monies will be used for retention of current and future Nursing Faculty. The lack of nurses moving toward nursing education is, and will, continue to be a challenge. Retaining and recruiting qualified competent faculty is vital to the state nursing shortage. Without nursinng educators,there cannot be nurses. This proposal seeks continued funding to support initiatives that assist in the preparation and graduation of competant nurses for clinical agencies throughout New Mexico, and especially those in rural and underserved areas.

The proposed project will stress initiatives aimed at increasing nursing student admission and decreasing nursing student attrition. Additionally, dual credit initiatives will be stressed at Artesia and Carlsbad high schools to increase the recruitment of high school graduates entering the nursing program of study. The project will increase intervention strategies aimed at retaining students recruiting and retaining qualified nursing faculty. All faculty will continue to complete professional development activities and training to further facilitate more student admissions and provide specific student guidance throughout. Producing Employees for the New Mexico Workforce As in many regions of the United States, a nursing shortage, an aging nurse population, and a decreasing amount of nursing educators, continues to be realities in New Mexico. The nursing program at NMSU Carlsbad needs to remain a major contributor to the healthcare workforce in New Mexico and needs to continue to produce highly qualified nurses in every type of clinical setting. Because many NMSU Carlsbad graduates who earn their ADN go on to earn their BSN or higher degrees, and stay in New Mexico to seek employment, this program is extremely vital to addressing the nursing shortage issues in the region and the state. A rigorous, and evidence -based curriculum and reputation for excellence in preparing students for the workforce make NMSU Carlsbad's ADN program a sought -after program of study; however, many of the students applying to the program are under -prepared and retention is therefore a critical issue. Part of the retention effort is to begin preparation of future nursing students by offering dual credit course work to high school students. The project at NMSU Carlsbad will emphasize nursing programs for high school students and thus start these students on the pathway to a career in nursing and allied health. Also, the NMSU Carlsbad project will stress retention of nursing students through various intervention strategies, and recruit and retain qualified nursing education faculty. As a result of these initiatives, a greater number of nurse will graduate from NMSU Carlsba d.

Project Description / Executive Summary : The nursing expansion allocation monies allows NMSU Carlsbad the ability to continue offering its student nurses the best educational experience possible. New Mexico , especially rural areas, is experiencing a severe shortage of nurses and it is imperative tha t the college s and universities provides a well -prepared and competent cadre of nurses each year that are ready to move into the workforce and fulfill healthcare needs. The salaries earned by these nurses are competitive with other states and the nursing personnel make a significant contribution to the city of Carlsbad, Eddy County, surrounding areas, and the New Mexico economy. NMSU Carlsbad is dedicated to ensuring that the nursing curricula are the epitome of best practices and that the nurses are appropriately trained and prepared to pass the National Licensing Examination. To this end, nursing expansion monies have been emplo yed to the payment of some nursing salaries at the high school level to recruit and introduce nursing program offerings to students in high school and dual credit programs. Additionally, monies will be used for recruitment of new faculty , continued training for, and retention of current and future Nursing Faculty. This proposal seeks continued funding to support initiatives that assist in the preparation and graduation of competent nurses for clinical agencies throughout New Mexico, and especially those i n rural and underserved areas. Binder Page: Page 155 of 8103.Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) The nursing expansion allocation of monies will be utilized for nursing salaries related to high school and dual credit programs, to assist with the purchase of needed simulation equipment, to assist with the costs of enhanced simulation professional development, and to retain quality a nd competent nursing faculty . 4.Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): The mission of NMSU Carlsbad Nursing Program is to promote health and improve the quality of life of the people of rural New Mexico through nursing education, practice and public service, recognizing the state's multicultural heritage and dynamic learning needs of Southeastern New Mexico. The program's mission is to prepare graduate nurses who are life -long learners and as members of an interdisciplinary health care team; use clinical judgement to provide caring, safe, evidence - based, client -centered care to promote quality of life. The NMSU Carlsbad ADN or LPN Program provides New Mexico hospitals and clinical agencies with a pipeline of competent new nursing graduates who are prepared to contribute to the nursing workforce in a variety of hospital based, community health, rural and mental health settings. A nursing degree offers mobility, flexibility, and numerous opportunities not just in New Mexico, but throughout the United States. The graduate of either the LPN or ADN program is provided with a sound basis for entry into practice at the appropriate level. Some examples of opportunities available in nursing are acute care hospitals, physician's offices, clinics, long term care settings, health departments, home health care agencies, and hospice care units. 5.Key Pro ject Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) The objectives of the RPSP project are to decrease the attrition rates experienced in the nursing program ; maintain and/or increase the number of applicants to the program by introducing the options of the nursing program at the high school level; to ensure appropr iate professional development , preparation , and retention of current and future faculty. 6.For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. One hundred percent of the faculty have completed professional development initi atives, but with the addition of two new faculty members, a strong emphasis must continue on this initiative. The nursing program continues to work on the student support initiatives in order to reduce attrition rates. The nursing program noticed a spike in attrition rates for the Fall of 2019 which was largely attributed to students \"feeling under prepared\" for the nursing program prior to entrance. During the Fall 2019 semester, there was an addition of two new faculty members to help with the vacancies left behind by the retirees and departures from the previous year . As the program continues to find qualified replacements, the expansion fund will also be utilized to help retain competent faculty members i n order to improve attrition rates. The number of applications to the nursing program continues to be stable, but a concern has been the need to train effective and competent faculty to provide the best possible educational experience for the students. 7.Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? The program has a direct impact on the state as it contributes to the number of qualified nurses. This initiative is of great service to the hospitals in Carlsbad, A rtesia, and other cities in southeastern New Mexico. 8.Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants?

Number of years the project has received General Fund support ( Disregard if new program): 7 years 2. Project Description / Executive Summary : The Dona Ana Community College Nursing Program has continuously utilized the RPSP funding to support various activities that help keep full approval for the New Mexico Board of Nursing, as well as maintaining continuing national accreditation through ACEN. Students benefit by ensuring that high fidelity simulation equipment and other learning resources are available. Having updated equipment and resources ensures that learning outcomes are met which helps achieve graduation and licensure completion for bot h LPN and RN students. The program strives to make sure all students in the nursing program complete the program within 6 months or 150% of time, so that graduate nurses can quickly be placed in local and statewide health care agencies which support pat ient health outcomes, while helping to decrease the nursing shortage. The program currently employs (8) full time faculty and (2) part time faculty, and (1) full time program director. The funding has allowed full time faculty salaries to be at a competitive range and helps maintain retention of nursing faculty. The program was given full approval by the NMBON, December 2019. In March 2020, the program was recommended for continuing accreditation for (8) years by the national accrediting agency, ACEN. Binder Page: Page 169 of 8102. Project Description / Executive Summary : The most recent NCLEX licensure pass rates are 96.55% for RN and 100% for LPN. Job placement rates for both RN and LPN graduates are at 100%, as graduate nurses find employment within (6) months of obtaining licensure. Plans for increased enrollment were scheduled to occur summer 2020 with the beginning of a trimester system that allowed admission to the program three times a year. Current enrollment is 73 students, but with trimester implementation enrollment would increase to 90 students. The RPSP funding has been a vital source for program success and continuation. 3. Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) The addi tional funding of $94,000 in FY 21, bringing the total budget support to $275,900, supported the conversion of (2) 9- month faculty members to 12 -month positions as well as supports the expansion of enrollment by helping the program accept a third cohort. Additionally, this increase in budget also allowed for expansion and maintenance of our simulation program, and more specifically supports the purchase of new virtual simulations which have become necessary in light of the COVID -19 restrictions on in -person clinical rotations with local clinical sites. The FY 22 budget request of $275,900 will continue to support the addition of a third cohort, allowing for the continuation of market differentials for all nursing faculty, and expand our virtual simulation capacity. This funding supports increased student enrollment and graduation, placement in high demand RN jobs in the community, and help s attract and retain qualified Nursing faculty as required by the New Mexico Board of Nursing (NMBON) and ACEN. Our market differentials represent 10% of the faculty member's base salary and has had a significant positive effect on our ret ention in recent years. The FY 22 budget will also allow for continued professional development for faculty and staff via online learning, simulation teaching practices, and training to achieve national accreditation both for ACEN and Simulation. Lastly, the FY22 budget w ill also support simulation equipment replacement, software updates to simulation equipment, and purchases of virtual simulation licenses. 4. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): The mission and purpose of RPSP funding is to provide support for recruitment and retention of qualified nursing faculty, and support end of program outcomes. Ensuring that faculty and students have the tools and resources such as supplies and equipment t o learn is crucial. Learning occurs thru distance education or face to face methods and both students and faculty need the tools and resources to meet program outcomes. Funding helps the program serve the needs of a largely non -traditional student popula tion, where over 70% of nursing program students are first -generation college students who are members of an ethnic/racial minority. Over 60% of students enrolled at DACC meet the federal standards for classification as low income. Out of the ethnic/racial minority populations, Hispanic/Latinx is the largest percentage represented. Many students who are \"First Generation\" college students lack exposure to Math and English skills, as well as having other economic challenges that result in students being placed at a disadvantage. Disadvantages result in high attrition rates and low persistence rates. It is important that the nursing program continue to support nursing students by providing low student to faculty ratios (8:1 NMBON & 9.7:1 NM Joint House M emorial 40), to allow for mentoring, tutoring and more one on one time with students that ensures student success. Binder Page: Page 170 of 8105. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) The purpose of the project is to support the continued expansion of the nursing program enrollment and to help continue meeting the end of program outcomes. Expanding enr ollment will lead to increased pre-nursing enrollment, increased graduation rates and increased nurses in the community which help improve the health outcomes of patients and their families. Funding will help the nursing program continue with meeting expansion of program services, increase d RN placement upon graduation, retention of qualified faculty, and investment in quality simulation, both face to face and virtual simulation. 6. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. Major Accomplishments 1) Cohort enrollment has grown from 16 students to over 20 students due to increased enrollment of LPN to RN and advanced placement students each year. 2) The program achieved has maintained an above 80% licensure pass rates for both RN and PN since 2016, currently the RN licensure pass rate is 96.55%, LPN is 100% 3) The program awarded 28 RN degrees and 5 LPN certificates for 2019. Spring 2020 has 12 RN degrees, and 13 PN certificates.

Does the RPSP align with the NMSU Mission? (Check all that apply) Research Public Service Teaching 2. Explain below how the program aligns with the mission. Answer is limited to the box below. The DACC Nursing Program Expansion Initiative, in alignment with the NMSU LEADS 2025 Strategic Goals, focuses on Goal 1, Enhancing Student Success & Mobility as well as Goal 4, Building a Robust University System. DACC's Nursing Program has long worked towards addressing increased enrollment of a diverse student population and cultivate long-standing relationships with our community health partners for both clinical educational experiences but also for job placement for our graduations upon graduation. Goal 1.1 Diversify, optimize, and increase system -wide enrollment requires a comprehension recruitment and retention plan centered around student needs. T he DAC C Nursing program serves the needs of a largely non -traditional student population, where over 70% of students are first - generation college students who are members of an ethnic/racial minority. Over 60% of students enrolled at DACC meet the federal standards for classification as low income. Out of the ethnic/racial minority populations, Hispanic/Latinx is the largest percentage represented. Many students who are \"First Generation\" college students lack exposure to Math and English skills, as well as having other economic challenges that result in students being placed at a disadvantage. Disadvantages result in high attrition rates and, low persistence rates. Goal 1.2, Increase student learning, retention, and degree attainment requires developing syst em wide advising practices that align with student learning objectives and promote student success. The DACC Nursing program prides itself on having a dedicated Nursing Advisor who works closely with faculty and students to ensure progression through the program, from admissions to graduation. Goal 4.2 Cultivate faculty and staff excellence and 4.3 Establish operational excellence through a metric -driven, service -oriented approach are goals clearly supported by the DACC Nursing program mission. Investme nt in faculty professional development and recruitment and retention efforts are key in meeting the rigorous standards set forth by the New Mexico Board of Nursing (NMBON) and ACEN accreditation bodies. Binder Page: Page 173 of 8103. Short Program Summary: Provide a short description of what the program does, i.e. Mission, scope, how the program benefits the state, or what challenge/need it addresses. The program summary is limited to the box below. It will be used as a description in submissions to the board of Regents, NMSU administration, the Higher Education Department or the Governor's Office. The DACC Nursing Program supports the mission of NMSU DACC as a responsive and accessible learning -centered program that provides educational opportunities to a diverse community of learners in support of workforce and economic development. The nursing program prepares students to graduate into either an LPN or Associates Nursing degree (RN) to help meet the need of the state's nursing shortage. The graduates of our program provide hands -on care to patients in a variety of settings and fill a major role in the healthcare system. We strive to improve health outcomes for patients and their families by providing qualified nurses to help mon itor, treat, and ensure patients are receiving the latest information to improve health outcomes of the state of New Mexico. Challenges that the DACC Nursing Program face include; recruiting and retaining qualified faculty that meet the states Board of Nursing requirements. Additionally, training faculty in up to date teaching methods and making the transition from practicing nurse to faculty requires training resources. Faculty must also be trained beyond the practical application of nursing which inc ludes student support efforts that include tutoring and mentoring as well as soft skills required in the industry. Other challenges include securing adequate space and resources to complete live (face to face) simulation, and laboratory experiences for st udents. 4.

Shape the Future. | New Mexico State University | FY 21 DACC Dental Hygiene program was establish ed in 2007. Its first graduating class of 12 hygienists was in 2009. The Program has graduated over 120 dental hygienists who usually stay and work in Southern New Mexico or other areas in New Mexico. The program operates an on -site dent al clinic open to the public where students, under faculty supervision, practice the craft of clinical dental hygiene while providing access to dental hygiene services to the community . The Dental Clinic is operated in support of the D ACC Dental Hygiene Associate degree program. The clinic, operating since 2008, ensures that entry -level dental hygiene students gain practical experience in a controlled, clinical setting. The clinic provides low cost dental care for citi zens who do not have access to dental care or who do not have insurance to access dental care.On average, the clinic provides low cost service s to over 600 patients yearly and reaches over 3000 individuals through community outreach. The clinical hours prepare the students for the licensure exam required to become Registered Dental Hygienists. The vast majority of patients served by the clinic a re uninsured or underinsured individuals from low income families or are students on limited budgets from DACC or NMSU . People of all ages receive educational, preven tive and therapeutic services such as: oral and general health assessments, oral cancer screening, dental examinations, dental radiographs, oral health instruction and counseling regarding nutrition and health life -style and their impact on oral and general health. OUTLOOK FOR DENTAL HYGIENE Because the Commission on Dental Accreditat ion (CODA) requires that dental hygiene students receive their training under the direct supervision and control of the Program, an on -site clinic is required . In addition, the DACC Dental Clinic is shar e d with the DACC Dental Assistant Program where students learn to work chair -side with practicing clinicians . The Program collaborates with other a g encies such as Las Cruces Public Schools, Amador Health and Ben Archer Clinics to improve access to oral health care services for patients at risk and those with no resources . The DACC clinic helps to expand the servic e s provided by other county public health agencies with the goal to improve the overall health of the county's citizens and thereby help reduce time lost from work and school due to oral/dental disease. The US. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the demand for Dental Hygienists will grow 11% from 2008 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations. The demand for hygienists is increas i ng as state laws allow dental hygienists to work at the top of their training.Quick Facts 100% pass rate on clinical board examinati ons. 90-95% Avg.

Number of years the project has received General Fund support ( Disregard if new program): 7 2. Project Description / Executive Summary : The Dental Clinic is operated in support of the DACC Dental Hygiene Associate degree program. The clinic began operation in Fall 2008 after the Legislature provided funding for start -up of the program. The program prepares students to practice entry- level dental hygiene in private dental offices, hospitals, and public health agencies. The program currently accepts cohorts of 12 students annually. As part of their academic and clinical education, dental hygiene students are exposed to different areas of patient care techniques and management skills while working in the clinic and experiential learning activities. Typically, a minimum of 12 -16 hours a week of clinical is required to provide sufficient practice time for all students. This prepares them for taking their licensure examinations to practice as Registered Dental Hygienists. The clinical practice is necessary to provide students with the skills necessary t o take national and state board ex aminations but also to provide preventative dental Hygiene services to the public in gen eral. The Program within the last year has engaged in several community service learning programs that have the following objectives: 1) To promote student learning and skill building outside of the typical clinical setting in school 2) To promote a sense of community and collaboration between the dental hygiene program and other community agencies Binder Page: Page 187 of 8102. Project Description / Executive Summary : 3) To improve service learning practices where students not only gain additional skills while working with the community but also improve access to preventive dental hygiene services and improve access to care of patients who have limited resources, no res ources and no insurance or under -insured. 4) Promote overall health in the community , decreasing future cost of more complicated treatment due to lack of dental insurance or lack of resources. 5) To provide school -based dental services at the public schools so that students have less school absences. 3. Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) The budget of $287 ,600 serves t o support the salaries of 3 FTE faculty and 0.50 FTE of a staff member Including fringe benefits. A small por tion of the budget is also used to subsidize some of the clinical expenses. The program is expanding its services to extramural sites to provide student s with additional service learning experiences as they provide excellent services to the community and provide access to dental hygiene services for those who are not able to get the care they need. Due to the extent of the clinical practice, the clinic is not able to be sustainable with self -revenues or student tuition. Providing the students with more ample experiences and service learning is a requirement for accreditation , and being able to provide those experiences while increasing access to care to the people of Las Cruces and other areas in Southern New Mexico is a win-win for the college, the students and the community. 4. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): The Program is committed to creating an educational environment that will foster the development of learning as a life -long process, providing students with the cognitive knowledge, psycho -motor skills and overall framework of affective values to provide dental hygiene care for a diverse, dynamic population. As part of the academic and clinical education of students in the Dental Hygiene Program, the DACC Dental H ygiene Program operates an on -site clinic which serves students and citizens of the community. Approximately 600 individuals, annually, are provided with preventive dental hygiene services by students who work and practice dental hygiene under the supervi sion of licensed dentists and dental hygienists. The vast majority of patients served by the clinic are uninsured or under -insured individuals from low income families or are students on limited budgets from DACC or NMSU. People of all ages receive educati onal, preventive and therapeutic services such as oral and general health assessments, oral cancer screening, dental examinations, dental radiographs, oral health instruction and counseling regarding Nutrition and health life -style and their impact on oral and general health. Students and faculty also participate in several community events and provide services free of charge to the community during those events. The program has its \"Happy Smiles\" free dental clinic for children 2 -17 during the month of F ebruary. Children receive all dental hygiene services free of charge during this two day event. Students and faculty also participate in the annual Special Olympics. Most recently, the Dental Hygiene program has expanded its outreach efforts to improve acc ess to dental hygiene services and prevention to under -served communities in Las Cruces and surrounding areas. We collaborate with Las Cruces Public Schools , and have opened the first of its kind \"Happy Smiles Dental Hygiene School Based Clinic\" at the Las Cruces Lynn Community School which is also the first community middle school in Las Cruces area. All dental hygiene services are provided to the children at Lynn free of charge. The program is also in initial planning and collaborating with Amador Health Center to provide dental hygiene services to the homeless population. T he program is also planning to take its services to the south part of the state at Sunland Park , and open a dental hygiene clinic at the DACC branch there to provide services to studen ts, women and children who have limited or no access to preventive dental hygiene services . 5. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) Objective 1: Retention and Graduation: 1. The program will maintain the number of stu dents admitted to the program at 12 students per year 2. The program will graduate 80% of those admitted to the program 3. The program will retain at least 80% of those admitted to the program 4. At least 80% of the students who graduate will compete exit surv eys and 80% will be satisfied with their education. Binder Page: Page 188 of 8105. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) Objective 2: Employment 1. 90% of students who graduate will find employment within one year of graduation 2. 90% of employer satisfaction will be reported on the employer surveys received. Objective 3 : Board Exams and Licensing Credentials: 1. 90% of students taking Board Exams will pass 2. 90% of the students who graduate will become licensed professionals 6. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. The Dental Hygiene Program successfully graduated 12/12 from the class of 2017 , 12/12 from the class of 2018 , 11/12 from the class of 2019, and 12/12 from the class of 2020. Students in classes 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 have passed their local anesthesia written board examinations . Class of 2020 is pending their clinical and Natio nal Board examinations due to COVID -19. One of the challenges encountered by the program has been finding adequate patients for students to work on to meet their clinical requirements for accreditation an d graduation. Recruiting dental and clinical faculty has also been a challenge this year. We continue to work on recruiting qualified dentists and hygienist s to assist in clinical teaching. Expanding our services to other sites in Las Cruces and surrounding areas will permit students to work on a bigger pool of patients while providing preventive services to the community. The program has a new dual degree program AAS to BSDH with the University of New Mexico where DACC Dental Hygiene Students can enroll in a dual degree track to complete their AAS at DACC and shortly after complete their BSDH at UNM. Class of 2021 ha s the first student enrolled in this dual degree program both at DACC and UNM. 7. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? The Dental Hygiene Program has had a significant impact in the Southwest and the State of NM overall. The program has provided quality and affordable education to many students who otherwise would have not been able to attend and aff ord the dental hygiene education at other institutions in the State or out of State. The Program is a competitive program but the cost of tuition is very low compared to similar programs in the State. Students receive the opportunity to graduate with an Associate of Applied Science in Dental Hygiene and enter the workforce with great opportunities for a good salary (avg salary of a dental hygienist in NM is about $ 65,000 annually). In addition, s tudents have the opportunity to enroll in a Dental Hygiene baccalaureate degree completion program at the University of New Mexico . Another benefit of the program includes the services offered to patients and students. The cost for services is very low compared to private practices and other community clinics. This year, the clinic and students provided services to over 1,500 patients in the on- site clinic and had over 2,500 pat ient encounters in the outreach programs , with the majority of the patients served being children. 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? The Dental Hygiene Program receives some funding from the Carl Perkins G rant. Some other grants have been sought and are being considered. Delta Dental of New Mexico donated $60,000; $30,000 received in FY 2019 and $30,000 in FY 2020 for the purchase of mobile equipment to start the school based clinic at Lynn Middle School. Other grants are being sought and funding has been secured from Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico and the Community Foundation of Southern New Mexico. Binder Page: Page 189 of 8109.

Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) $47,000.00 to be used to fund a part -time (.5 FTE or .75 FTE) student veteran liaison position to be officed in the SVRC 4. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): The SVRC is established to serve those persons who are trans itioning from military service to civilian life and the pursuit of an education (Adult Basic Education or College). Student veterans are often ill prepared to navigate their way through the post - secondary processes of applying for admission, financial aid, or VA benefits. Following the successful acceptance into college (an automatic process for NMSU Gran ts as a two -year Community College), student veterans often require increased attention by a college staff member to help them to learn and maintain practices of subsequent enrollment and retention. The latter refer s to st udent veterans making satisfactory progress as they pursue either Adult Basic Education, college -level education, or both. 5.

NMSU Grants Mission: NMSU Grants provides an accessible quality education through innovative teaching and learning that promotes respect and service for our diverse students and community. The Student Veterans Resource Center (SVRC) directly addresses the institutional mission by providing supplemental student services to aid individuals transitioning from the military to civilian life and pursuit of education (Adult Basic Education or College). Individual and group tutoring taking place in the SVRC provides reinforcement of learning through faculty -recommended and/or directed activities tied to specif ic courses . Faculty also may embed supp lemental instruction taking place in the SVRC to aid student veterans to ensure they have every opportunity to successfully complete an individual course or program of study. To ensure Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP), the services offered in the SVR C and the assistance and guidance provided by the part -time liaison staff member provide ongoing support to the student veterans to increase the odds of their retainment through courses of study and completion of an overall program -of-study. In turn, this results in immediate entrance into the workforce or transfer to NMSU to continue educational objectives leading to the completion of a four -year degree. The SVRC's services are also provided to transitioning veterans to ensure they have every opportunity to be recognized as important members of the community of learners represented through NMSU Grants . Like all students enrolled, student veterans are entitled to participate in campus activities tied to or generated from the SVRC. Binder Page: Page 203 of 8103.

Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) Community College Opportunity for Research Experience (SCCORE) Summer 2019 expenses carried over to this reporting year; therefore, funding was provided for materials, supplies, travel to partner campuses statewide, housing, and meals associated with the program. Because of COVID -19, we could not hold SCCORE 2020 . However, state funding paid for an internship p rogram at a STEM -AMP partner institution, Santa Fe Community College (SFCC) , for SFCC Engineering students who took an online Zoom course taught by the STEM AMP Institutional Coordinator at SFCC. Participants learned how to design Personal Protective Equip ment (PPE) and how to navigate the process of prin ting on a 3 -D printer . The students did their course and design work from home and sent th em to a nearby or self- owned 3 -D printer, at which point , the PPE was collected and disseminated to the Navajo Nations/Pueblos area s to help provide for needs of th ose communit ies because of COVID -19. The 8-week program was collaboratively funded by STEM -AMP and by Growth Sector and the Uni versity of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) through a joint National Science Foundation (NSF) -funded INCLUDES Alliance project. 4. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): Since 1993, When STEM AMP was established as an undergraduate organization focused on underrepresented minority (URM) STEM students, the mission has been to increase the number of STEM degrees awarded to URMs. This mission aligns with the 2025 LEADS Missio n of NMSU . NMSU, the Lead Institution of STEM AMP, is the state's land -grant and space -grant university and is recognized as a Hispanic -Serving Institution (HSI) . STEM AMP looks to the LEADS 2025 Mission, Vision, Values, and Strategic Goals to align our organization, its programs, and activities . NMSU and 12 of the other 13 STEM AMP Alliance partners are recognized Hispanic -Serving Institutions (HSIs). STEM AMP aligns with NMSU's 2025 Mission to foster diversity, learning, inclusion, social mobility, and service to the broader community. The following nine statewide STEM AMP programs reflect the LEADS 2025 stated values and goals of student success and social mobility, research and creativity, and extension and outreach: -The Undergraduate Research Scholars (URS): Students are provided with a faculty -mentored research assist antship experience, professional development training , and the opportunity to present research. This program lead s to retention by providing a learning community and engaging and relevant research. It also provides social mobility internships , leading to future careers. -The STEM -PREP program: Th is program allows participants who are Freshmen 2nd-semester or Sophomore 1st- or 2nd- semester to participate in research activities, training, and an opportunity to locate a faculty mentor that prepare s them for URS. - The International Research and Education Participation (IREP): Helps students gain global perspectives by directing them to available international research experiences and provides small stipends to complete the total funding needs . - STEM AMP Student Research Conference: The annual STEM AMP Student Research Conference b rings together students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) from statewide alliance partner community colleges and universities to present research and to participate in professional development workshops and networking activities. -The Summer Community College Opportunity for Research Experience (SCCORE) program: SCCORE provides community college (cc) students with research opportunities, fosters academic success, and assists in the transition to university. With a residential program at every university, SCCORE orients community students to university life and the culture of research. Binder Page: Page 214 of 8104. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): -Book Stipend Award : This award is offered annually in the fall only, and is intended as a recruitment tool to attract students who are interested in NM AMP and its programs. -Community College Professional Development Workshops: The STEM AMP Student Research Conference includes pre- and post -conference workshops the day before and the day after the Conference to help community college students navigate the conference, learn to read abstracts so they can select the most relevant presentations to attend at the conference , learn more about transfer to the 4 -year institution , and reflect on the conference experience. -Transfer Stipend Award: Transfer stipends for students are available for STEM AMP participants the first semester of transfer from partner 2 -year institutions to 4 -year partner institutions. -The Student Advisory Board: Comprised o f one representative from each of the 14 partner institutions on a rotating basis , the Student Advisory Board represents the institution's STEM AMP program and influence s other students to participate. In addition, the Student Advisor's valued perspectives assist the leadersh ip of STEM AMP . 5. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) Project Objectives focus primarily on the increase of the num ber of STEM B.S. degrees awarded to Underrepresented (URM) students in New Mexico through quality STEM -specific services and programs, including undergraduate research, professional dev elopment, and transfer support. Aligning with the NMSU LEADS 2025 Strategic Plan and Goals 1, 2, and 3 and some of their Objectives , STEM AMP's project goals and objectives focus on this increase of URM numbers by assisting statewide students with research -focused experiences, professional developme nt training and experiences, and guidance and support to assist 2 -year students with transfer to the 4 - year institutio n. The STEM AMP program goals align with LEADS 2025 Goals 1, 2, and 3 to 1) enhance student success and social mobility, 2) to elevate research and creativity, and 3) to amplify extension and outreach. These are carried out by the specific objectives that also align with LEADS 2025 Objectives of increasing student retention and degree attainment ( Objective 1.2); strengthen ing career pathways through experiential learning and research engagement that address local and global challenges (Objective 1.4 and 2. 1); encouraging progression to graduate school (Objective 1.5 ); becoming a recognized leader in valuing the inclusion of diverse participants in recognizing diversity as an asset among minority -serving, land grant, and space -grant institutions (Objective 4 .1); cultivating faculty and staff excellence (Objective 4.2); and establishing operational excellence through a metric -driven, service -oriented approach (Objective 4.3). NSF requires STEM AMP , and all other LSAMPs in existence for over 10 years, to complete an educational/social science research project. There is strong evidence from the research literature and the evaluation s that STEM AMP has done that undergraduate research experiences and professional socialization activities help cultivate s cientific identity and facilitate STEM persistence for URM students. For our focused social science project for this funding period of 2018 -2023, social science experts , funded by STEM AMP , are studying the factors that lead to s cientific identity developm ent and subsequent success in STEM. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the success of broadening participation programs such as STEM AMP remains incomplete. To elucidate these mechanisms, our social science research project is focusing on these factors leading to students' scientific identity development and STEM success. This social science study aligns with Binder Page: Page 215 of 8105. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) LEADS Goals and Objectives, particularly those that enhance student success, social mobility, and that achieve comprehensive excellence while l earning from social scientists in how to improve our programs for our student populations. This may lead to more understanding about the needs of URMs and successful outcomes for them. 6.

Outcomes of progress thus far explained in #9 . Binder Page: Page 217 of 8106. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. Obstacles: -The COVID -19 was a major factor the Spring and Su mmer semester for our program. A majority of our URS students were unable to work in their labs (a few could do their animal or plant research); therefore, students were assigned Literature Reviews to give them better backgrounds of their research and to see the implications for future research when the URS meets again in the fall. In interviews, students said the time was useful to learn more about the background, methodologies, and implications of their research from doing the Literature Reviews. Our SCC ORE program, held each June, was cancelled because of COVID -19 and the Stay- at-Home order. 7. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? One of the primary efforts that Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has invested time and funding is education, and among other elements of change in the educational system is her focus on assisting minority students and at-risk students by investing in strate gies that improve education. Governor Grisham's efforts are addressed in the goals and outcomes of STEM AMP . Program impact is evidenced by the STEM AMP statewide number of directly -funded students FY 20 (N=198 ) (N=220) . In addition, the percentages of B.S. degrees earned by underrepresented students is 51% (N=947) for 2018- 2019 , which are our latest updated numbers . Through the contributions of STEM AMP and other statewide programs, such as EPSCoR, CAMP, STEP, HSI , S-STEM, STEM -H, the In dian Resource Development program and other statewide programs , the numbers of URMs who earn B.S. degree in New Mexico is increasing. 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? Since 1993, when STEM A MP was established, over $ 43.7 million in funding has been leveraged against state funding. State funding is critical in securing future NSF funding because NSF values other entities' investments in our program. STEM AMP Funding included the following: STEM AMP Phase VI funding, awarded in August, 2018, $4 M (2018- 2023) from the National Science Foundation LSAMP program. NSF S -STEM and U.S. Department of Education SSS STEM H are housed in the STEM AMP area and benefit from adminis tration help from STEM AMP.

Binder Page: Page 219 of 8109. Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) *Student Advisory Board (a representative who helps with recruitment and lends student perspective for improvement of our programs) STEM AMP hired a Data Analyst, who is working closely with the Manager of the Unit Systems/Tech Support in Extension Computer Support Services to set up a p ortal in which applications can be submitted, a database in which data can be collected and maintain ed, and a database component with a reporting function. In addition, one of the primary efforts since January of 2020 has been to ensure that data is reported accurately and maintained for our different current and future reporting needs. STEM AMP collaborated on an internship entitled the New Mexico Advanced Manufacturing Personal Protective Equipment (NMAMPPE) Project at Santa Fe Community College (SFCC), one of STEM AMP's partner institutions . The program, entitled the New Mexico Advanced Manufacturi ng Personal Protective Equipment (NMAMPPE) Project, is collaboratively funded by STEM AMP and Growth Sector and the University of Colorado Boulder through a joint National Science Foundation (NSF) -funded INCLUDES Alliance project. Students will perform the course work and design work from home and use 3D printers available to them for personal protective equipment (PPE) to be disseminated to the Navajo Nation, Pueblos, and others of high need and low access to PPE. The students will take a credit -bearing Zo om course coordinated and taught by the STEM AMP Institutional Coordinator and Lead Engineering Faculty and PI of the program. Summary of the Progress/Results of the Social Science Research Component: NSF requires that all alliances in existence for over 10 years, participate in a research study. For our focused social science project for this funding period of 2018- 2023, social science experts funded by STEM AMP are studying the factors that lead to scientific identity development and subsequent success in STEM. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the success of broadening participation programs such as STEM AMP remains incomplete. To elucidate these mechanisms, our social science research project is focusing on these factors leading to students' scientific identity development and STEM success. This social science study aligns with LEADS Goals and Objectives, particularly those that enhance student success, social mobility, and that achieve compre hensive excellence while learning from social scientists how to improve our programs for our student populations. During Year 2 (FY 20) of the grant, the social science experts surveyed approximately 900 additional early career STEM majors, followed 470 re spondents from Year 1, using institutional data and follow -up surveys, and conducted faculty and student interviews. While the social scientists are still collecting and clearing the longitudinal survey data, they have begun disseminating the preliminary findings through presentations and manuscripts. Faculty interviews are currently being transcribed and analyzed, while student interviews are ongoing. Qualitative interview data is being collected and analyzed. Twelve NM AMP faculty mentors were interviewed to learn about their interactions with STEM students. Also, women engineering students and associates of science majors from Dona Ana Community College are being interviewed. COVID -19 has constrained the study, so data collection was a ffected, but is no w on track with Zoom or phone interviews. Binder Page: Page 220 of 810 Medical Projects 10.

Does the RPSP align with the NMSU Mission? (Check all that apply) Research Public Service Teaching 2. Explain below how the program aligns with the mission. Answer is limited to the box below. STEM AMP looks to the NMSU LEADS 2025 Mission, Vision, Values, and Goals for concise and focused criteria to improve our own program . Importantly, STEM AMP makes a concerted effort to align our mission to the mission of NMSU, which follows: \"to serve the diverse needs of the state through comprehensive programs of education, research, extension and outreach, and public service. As the state's land -grant and space -grant university, and as a Hispanic -Serv ing Institution, NMSU fosters learning, inquiry, diversity and inclusion, social mobility, and service to the broader community .\" In alignment with this mission, STEM AMP's nine programs purposefully and intentionally strive to fulfill this mission. Since 1993, the STEM AMP progra m, in collaboration with other statewide STEM programs, has contributed to increasing the retention, development, and graduation of underrepresented minority (URM) students in STEM. In 1993 -94, 203 URM students received a B.S. degree, and that number increased to 947 in 2018 -19. STEM AMP's mission is to assist URM students statewide through our activities, events, programs, and opportunities that are designed to increase student recruitment, retention, and graduation in STEM. Our focus on research is a key element in offering opportunities for academic and social integration, and financial support, each important to all students, but particularly significant for URMs, first - generation, or at -risk students . Our target population, t hese students may lack a sense of belonging and community and be unfamiliar with the culture of the university , and r esearch programs not only offer social networking , acceptance , and a sense of belonging in a community, but they also foster academic achievement, develop learning skills, and assist students to knowledgeably inquire and think critically. Our research focus also offers social mobility for students as they are encouraged to participate in internships that often lead to earning higher degree s and entering relevant, engaging, and profitable careers. Our research programs provide professional develop men t training and participation in research symposiums and conferences, attend ance at workshops on issues that develop and provide academic and career aspirations to secure futures for students . In our programs, s tudents often begin to gain passion for topics that matter, such as the need for safe drinking water that directly relate to needs in their ow n communities and encourages students to choose disciplines that prepare them for solving problems and issues in their own and the broader community. Faculty research mentors and their graduate assistants provide good role models by which to pattern their own work ethics, and our programs offer stipends that assist students financially and instill independence and self -efficacy . Therefore, as evidenced by the explanation above, STEM AMP's mission to serve URM, at -risk, and first - generation students and provide them opportunities to pursue productive academic and professional lives by assisting students to develop academically and professiona lly align with the mission criteria of NMSU .

It also provides book stipends, tutoring, mentoring, leadership conferences and multiple STEM workshops throughout their first year. After their freshman year, students apply for limited book stipends and financial assistance for internships and other career related opportunities. CAMP helps students with resume writing, mock job interviews, job portfolio development, and career readiness. All CAMP students have access to a CAMP computer lab, a study area, and laptops and graphing calculators. Expansion funds will help further institutionalize our internship initiative, expand book stipends and scholarships, and provide more leadership, career readiness and professional development opportunities to CAMP students. NMSU CAMP's Impact in New Mexico 70% of CAMP graduates are professionals in New Mex ico contributing to the State's workforce engine. NMSU CAMP fulfills NMSU's land -grant mi s sion of serving traditionally underserved populations across New Mexico. Our outreach and recruitment occurs across New M exico high schools, reaching over 600 students to determine eligibility. We visit families across rural communities, at college fairs, through our NMSU Cooperative Extension offices, and New Mexico farms, dairies, and ranches. NMSU CAMP students are mostly Hispan i c, first- generation college students, and Pell grant recipients. NMSU CAMP was awarded a five -year gr an t from the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Migrant Education for $2,124,959 until 2022. State funds are imperative in leveragi ng the nearly $8 million awarded in federal funding from 2002 -2022. 2021 NMSU CAMP Mission To serve the postsecondary educational needs of eligible farmworkers, dairy workers, and ranch workers across New Mexico by recruiting and retaining them until their graduation at NMSU.

Number of years the project has received General Fund support ( Disregard if new program): 14 2. Project Description / Executive Summary : The NMSU College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) specifically serves the educational need s of eligible U.S. citizen and permanent resident farming, dairy and ranch workers from across New Mexico. NMSU CAMP recruits and retains economically disadvantaged students until their graduation, and provides them with professional preparedness training and student leadership opportunities. CAMP students are underrepresented, first generation college students (mainly Hispanic and Pell Grant recipients [99%]). Student s major across all disciplines and majors at NMSU , and freshmen are specifically exposed to several NMSU STEM based programs to generate scientific interest and STEM majors . At CAMP, students receive outreach, mentoring, stipends, leadership orientations, preparedness courses, research experiences, and job readiness opportunities when funding is possible. State funding will help retain students with hands- on STEM experiences and research- related activities including, but not limited to, professional and job preparedness and leadership opportunities . State f unding will also support efforts to attract and leverag e federal funds (nearly $8 million since 2002) for CAMP programming, which increases graduation rates, post -graduate studies and internships, and overall, contributes to the professional workforce in New Mexico. Binder Page: Page 235 of 8103. Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) Funds are necessary to accomplish program goals and objectives , and retention initiatives for students until their graduation/degree completion. Support services and financial support (book stipends and scholarships) will be awarded to upperclassmen as funds are available. Research and internship program s within New Mexico will help students with job preparedness and career readiness (when funding is available). State funds have consistently strengthened our federal funding and overall retention of students. In 2017, NMSU CAMP received federal funding for an additional five years in the amount of $2.2 million, due in large part to the RPSP state funding (federal dollars are only for freshmen students; RPSP funding functions to retain students through their graduation). 4. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): NMSU CAMP's mission is to serve the educational needs of eligible farm workers, dairy workers and ranch workers from across New Mexico by recruiting and retaining them until their graduation. 5. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performa nce measure form) All project objectives address Academics, Graduation and Diversity, as well as Workforce Development. Program objectives will function to recruit, retain, and support continuing students beyond the freshmen year , and will work to increas e and/or maintain a freshmen cohort of 30 incoming students through outreach and other related activities conducted until their graduation. 6. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. CAMP has generated nearly 8 million in federal dollars for NMSU through the U.S. Department of Education for freshmen retention purposes . RPSP funding has made it possible to leverage these federal dollars . CAMP serves first generation, mainly Pell Grant recipient students (99%) ranging from first generation to fourth generation New Mexicans working on small farms to large- scale dairy, ranching, and agricultural operations across New Mexico. Since 2002, a total of 503 students have participated in the NMSU CAMP program including 90 sets of siblings. 69% of our students are currently enrolled at NMSU and/or have graduated from NMSU since 2002. 35 % of our CAMP students graduated from NMSU between 4 to 4.5 years; and 2 % in 3 to 3.5 years; 36% in 5 to 5.5 years; and 27% in 6 years. As of May 20 20: 31 students have an Associates and 215 have a bachelor's degree; 35 have Masters degrees 4 students are currently pursuing Masters degrees at NMSU and 1 is completing his dissertation in Mechanical E ngineering a t NMSU after participating in a Masters Accelerated Program; 1 student is completing her doctorate in education degree through an on-line program (but is employed professionally in NM), and another student is attending UNM Law School and plans to remain in NM to practice law . Our first medical doctor is completing his hospital rotation at UNM Hospital; two students completed a PhD from NMSU and work in academic settings (out-of-state) . Our first Juris Doctorate recipient has opened his private practice law firm in Las Cruces, NM. One CAMP graduate is an Education Specialist in Bilingual Counseling and Psychology working in Southern NM. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, summer programming was impacted. The Civil Engineering Department's Summer Bridge Inspection internship/CAMP partnership served 1 CAMP student. This 6-week program that consisted of 2 weeks of course work and 4 weeks of field work (travel throughout the state) was cut t o only a two-week course. Also, t he Medicinal Plants Summer Research Internship Program which allows 8 CAMP students to conduct and present research in a NMSU research lab had to be c anceled, because in early June 2020, there were no measures in place to safely return to campus . We c ontinue to be limited in the number of book stipends/scholarships we are able to award to the 131 currently enrolled students that we serve. Binder Page: Page 236 of 8107. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? NMSU CAMP fosters the economic growth of professionals working in New Mexico by preparing a diverse and educated workforce that is competent and highly qualified. Students are prepared to work in a competitive workforce at the state, national, and international levels. The vast majority of our students are bilingual and bicultural which are additional traits needed for a changing demographic environment and majority -minority state. CAMP also works to increase the educational level and earning power of New Mexicans, and also to increase extension and outreach services that stimulate economic, social, education and community development across New Mexico. These efforts also benefit hard to reach rural and farmworking com munities. NMSU CAMP recruits students statewide to provide New Mexico residents with access to postsecondary education, and opportunities to become professionals in their desired fields, and ultimately to return to their local communities to work (CAMP students traditionally desire to return to their hometowns across New Mexico to work , or choose to stay in New Mexico to remain close to their families). They have also proven to give back to their communities through volunteerism; over 70% of NMSU CAMP gra duates work throughout New Mexico in various careers such as teachers, scientists, engineers, criminal justice professionals, accountants, agricultural specialists, and nurses, while contributing to the state's economic developmental goals. *Student Outcomes are noted below under \"Accomplishments .\" 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? Since 2002, NMSU CAMP has received federal funds from the U.S. Department of Education through competitive grants . In 2017, we secured 2.2 million in federal funding until 2022. We also have two endowed scholarships and one memorial scholarship fund through the NMSU Foundation in which at least 5 scholarships are awarded to CAMP students each academic year. 9. Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) 2019 -2020 marked the year NMSU CAMP served its 500th student. A s part of our leadership activities, an event commemorating this accomplishment was held in the Fall semester and included a panel of CAMP graduates , current students, and their families. A CAMP alumna working for Raytheon as an engineer was our keynote speaker , as was a CAMP alumn who is a loc al practicing attorney . Since 2002, 503 students have participated in the NMSU CAMP program, including 90 sets of siblings. 215 students have graduated with a Bachelor's degree; 35 with a Masters degree; 2 with a PhD and 2 are currently working on their PhD/EdD ; 1 with a JD and another currently attending UNM Law School; one former student is an MD at UNM Medical School. One CAMP graduate is an Education Specialist in Bilingual Counseling and Psychology working in Southern NM. We periodically have our graduates return to give workshops or public presentations to our current students and their families. Two former CAMP students , now a CPA accountant and a social worker/advocate for migrant education, sit on our advisory council. 31 students have also completed an Associates degree. Over 70% of NMSU CAMP graduates work throughout New Mexico in various career s (teachers, scientists, engineers, accountants, agricultural specialists, nurses, etc.) contributing to the state's economic development goals. 35 % of our CAMP students graduated from NMSU between 4 to 4.5 years; and 2 % in 3 to 3.5 years; 36% in 5 to 5.5 years (which is still below the national six year average to complete a Bachelors degree); and 2 7% have completed their degree in 6 years. Average GPA of CAMP graduates (Bachelors) is 3. 16. In 20 19-2020, four students participated in a study abroad experience in Spain . 20 CAMP students received tuition and book scholarships for summer 2020 courses. 93 book stipends were awarded to CAMP upperclassmen during the 2019 -2020 academic year. Binder Page: Page 237 of 8109. Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) CAMP is the only year -long academic program focused on at -risk farmworker student retention at NMSU, and has a strong partnership with the State Migrant Education programs across NM including several farmworker advocate stakeholders like NMSU's Cooperative Extension Services . For outreach and recruitment purposes, our recruiter visit ed with nearly 600 students to determine eligibility at high schools, at community meetings in small, rural areas, at information fairs and during parent nights, schools day visits and school monthly meetings. In February 2020, 4 students participated in the annual NM Legislative Shadowing Initiative and 23 attended the annual HEP CAMP Student Leadership Conference, both in Santa Fe; 4 students attended and participated in the US Hispanic Leadership Institute Conference held in Chicago. We partnered with NM SU Career Center, NM HELP and NM Workforce Solutions for career e xploration and career and job preparedness opportunities . 8 CAMP students from engineering, social work, business, and health, were part of the pilot CAMP Student Internship Program, and were placed with local community organizations, local businesses and a national laboratory.

Does the RPSP align with the NMSU Mission? (Check all that apply) Research Public Service Teaching 2. Explain below how the program aligns with the mission. Answer is limited to the box below. NMSU CAMP serves first generation students from rural regions with limited resources and access to college. We recruit students statewide through K- 12 Migrant Education Program collaborators. We contribute to NMSU's diversification, since 99% of our students are Pell Grant recipients, and 99% of our students are Latino. NMSU CAMP fosters a culture of 'Aggie Life' that reflects service -learning, experiential learning, engagement in campus community, and engagement in research. Our ASNMSU CAMP student organization is a key vehicle to accomplish this goal, as is our piloted internship project that pairs CAMP students with community partner agencies (when fun ding is available). We also sponsor students to attend professional conferences, internships, study abroad and other forms of engagement in service- learning or research, like our summer Medical Plants Research Internship program. NMSU CAMP increases stud ent learning, retention, and degree attainment by helping students transition into their academic setting, which leads to professional careers. Our intensive academic advising, individualized education plans, and peer mentoring program provide academic sup port for student success. CAMP strengthens career pathways through job and career readiness via mandatory career fairs; we also partner with New Mexico Workforce Solutions during students' final academic semester to seek employment opportunities. More than 70% of our graduates work throughout New Mexico. CAMP alumn i assist us in hiring or notifying us of job openings for soon -to-graduate students; some alumn i are professionally positioned to hire graduates, and to provide feedback on resumes and job intervi ews. CAMP also elevates graduate education by promoting NMSU's Masters Accelerated Program to our CAMP students. Our first CAMP MAP student is now a doctoral candidate. We also provide competitive book stipends and tuition assistance for graduate students. Binder Page: Page 239 of 8103.

Number of years the project has received General Fund support ( Disregard if new program): 16 2. Project Description / Executive Summary : RPSP funding supports initiatives to meet a critical state -wide demand for baccalaureate -prepared RNs. The NMSU School of Nursing provides New Mexico hospit als and clinical agencies with highly trained new nursing graduates . With 68 % of NMSU Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) graduates staying in New Mexico in 2019 , the NMSU BSN program is a critical part of the solution to the state's critical nu rsing workforce needs . Graduating qualified nurses during a pandemic is espec ially important, as nurses are the vital link between the patient and the rest of the health care team. The NMSU nursing program collaborates with its higher education partners across the state to deliver a common curric ulum that allows nursing students to easily move from community college to university level courses. At NMSU the BSN degree consists of 3 semesters of nursing pre -requisite coursework, followed by 5 semesters of nursing courses with 780 hours of clinical t raining. In addition to the Las Cruces campus, NMSU delivers the BSN program to students at the NMSU -Alamogordo and NMSU -Grants campuses , meeting critical workforce needs in those communities . BSN program enrollment is limited by: 1) the number of qualified faculty and 2) laboratory space available for clinical skills instruction and training. Nurse Expansion funds have supported nursing faculty Binder Page: Page 267 of 8102. Project Description / Executive Summary : salaries and professional development, student support services, as well as equipment and software to improve the quality and efficiency of delivering nursing education. The School of Nursing is request ing an increase in funding to 1) support enrollment growth, 2) enhance pre -nursing student support services to increase the pipeline of qualified applicants to the BSN program , 3) extra laboratory equipment and personal protection supplies to meet our COVID -19 safety protocols , and 4) a simulation technician for the Nursing Skills and Simulation Center to bring the staffing levels up to national standards and other facilities in the state . 3. Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) Currently, Nurse Expansion funding is used for: Faculty and professional staff salaries Faculty development and travel BSN curriculum implementation Simulation laboratory equipment/operations Miscellaneous expenses for BSN program This year's request includes increased funding. The following is a justification for this request: Item : One (1) BSN College Assistant Professor salary + fringe ($65,000/year 9 month salary + $24,375 fringe = $89,375 ) Justification : The BSN program expanded enrollment in FY20 & FY21 by 32 students/year (16 in Las Cruces, 8 in Alamogordo, and 8 in Grants). W e would like to increase enrollment by an additional 16/years at the Las Cruces campus, w hich would put us at full capacity given our current lab and classroom spaces. The FY20 and FY 21 enrol lment increases were funded through a redistribution of salary savings at the college level and an i ncrease in RPSP funding in FY21 . To continue with this enrollment growth, we will require the addition of one additional full time College Assistant Professor . Item : BSN Advisor ($41,310 salary + $15,491 fringe = $56,801 ) Justification : Currently the School of Nursing (SON) has one advisor for 325 BSN students. This individual also manages the School of Nursing database and student records, provides considerable support to the CAASS advisors and individual pre -nurs ing students, and conducts degree audits to identify students eligible to apply to the BS N program. The recent and projected enrollment growth has created a critical need for an additional BSN program advisor. Item : Medical equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies ($19,500) Justification : With the COVID -19 pandemic, the SON had to rethink the way it teaches nursing skills to students. We have reduced the numbe r of times students rotate to different laboratory rooms to limit the potential transmission of SARS -Cov2/COVID- 19. This will require that we purchase additional medical equipment so that all of our laboratory rooms can be stocked. We also had to provide masks and other protec tive equipment for our students as required by the university and local clinical agencies . In order to ensure the best training possible and the safety of our students, we need additional funding to provide the same medical equipment in at least two additional laboratory rooms, and provide approximately 8,300 masks, 250 face shields and safety glasses, and 150 boxes of gloves per semester . There is also additional expense for items to clean and disinfect lab space and equipment. Binder Page: Page 268 of 8103. Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) Item : One (1) S imulation Laboratory Coordinator ($36,720/year salary + $13,770 fringe = $50,490 ) Justification : The School of Nursing conducts approximately 25% of its clinical training hours in the Nursing Skills & Simulation Center. This center is staffed by one full time staff member (a lab coordinator ) and graduate assistants . Most nursing labs and simulation centers in the region, state and nation have full time technical staff to program and run the computerized mannequins, set up nursing skills labs and simulated patient care scenarios. In the event that we are denied access to hospitals and other clinical facilities due to COVID -19, the School of Nursing needs to be prepared to conduct clinical training in its laboratory facility which will require adequate staffing. 4. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): Our mission at the School of Nursing is to promote health and improve the quality of life of the people of New Mexico through nursing education, research, practice and public service, recognizing the state's multicultural heritage and dynamic border enviro nment. A BSN degree from NMSU provides great opportunity for social mobility due to our near -100% graduate employment rates and the high earning potential of nurses (average New Mexico RN salary in 2017 was $69,000/year). The School of Nursing BSN program serves a diverse student body: 69% are from under- represented racial and ethnic minority populations 72% were designated as having 'financial need' (a federal financial aid designation that is reported through the Office of Financial Aid). 52% qualified for Pell Grants -The Federal Pell Grant is usually awarded to undergraduates who have a high degree of unmet financial need. Students whose families have a total income of up to $50,000 may be eligible for the need -based funding, though most Pell grant mone y goes to students with a total family income below $20,000/year. Approximately 70% work part time or full time while going to nursing school Approximately 80% come from New Mexico and 40% come from rural counties in New Mexico The mission of this RPSP is to continue efforts to increase the pipeline of baccalaureate -prepared registered nurses for the state of New Mexico. One key element of this program has been the implementation of the statewide New Mexico Nursing Education Consortium (NMNEC) BSN curriculum. In addition to being founding members and active leaders in NMNEC (5 -7 monthly committee/task force meetings, semi -annual educator conferences, and collaborative research/scholarship) the NMSU School of Nursing regularly collaborates with the nursing p rograms at Dona Ana Community College, NMSU- Carlsbad, and Western New Mexico University. A second critical component was the development of BSN programs on two community college campuses - NMSU -Alamogordo and NMSU-Grants. NMNEC makes BSN education readily available throughout the state and is particularly appealing to those from rural and underserved areas. The Nurse Expansion program at NMSU supports the State's workforce needs, and addresses such recommendations in The Institute of Medicine's 2014 rep ort 'The Future of Nursing', which calls for a significant increase in the number of BSN -prepared nurses by 2020. Currently over 80% of employers state a preference to hire nurses with the BSN degree due to research demonstrating improved patient outcomes when a higher percentage of BSN -prepared nurses are employed. Binder Page: Page 269 of 8105. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) Nurse Expansion Objectives for FY22 Increase BSN program enrollment in a sustainable manner, while maintain ing required faculty: student ratios, graduation rates, and NCLEX -RN exam pass rates. Identify additional innovative and high -quality clinical training experiences (in person and online) for BSN students throughout southwestern New Mexico. Offer a 1 -credit pre-nursing Freshman seminar to orient all incoming pre -nursing students (~300/year = 10 course sections) to the university, BSN major, and nursing profession . Provide faculty with state of the science professional development in BSN education. Support facult y in obtaining the Certified Nurse Educator certification from the National League for Nursing. Enhance advising and student support mechanisms for all BSN and pre -nursing students. Strengthen partnerships with campus programs that support pre -nursing students from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds such as the College Assistant Migrant Program (CAMP) . Enhance advising and application processes in coordination with the Center for Academic A dvising and Student Success (CAASS). Enhance career advising by connecting students with potential employers, on campus, in the community and at career fairs. Seek additional program funding through federal agencies such as the Health Research and Services Administration (HRSA). 6. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. Major Accomplishments (from 2019 -20) Successfully converted all BSN didactic and clinical courses to online delivery methods in March/April 2020 . Graduated all 60 BSN students in May 2020, despite the challenges brought on by COVID -19. Maintained BSN program enrollment increase s from FY20 (128 in Las Cruces, 24 in Alamogordo, and 8 in Grants accepted to the BSN program each year ). Improved outreach and advising offered to pre -nursing students at all three campuses resulting in a significant increase in BSN program applications. Strengthened partnerships with every healthcare organization in the state that the BSN program uses as a clinical training site . Improved the efficiency of faculty and administrator workload to support enrollment increases and additional programming. Upgraded and converted all of the distance education delivery technology at our NMSU -Grants and NMSU - Alamogordo with new videocameras, computers and Zoom software . Maintained high student satisfaction with the BSN program as evidenced by course evaluations , exit/alumni surveys and clinical site surv eys. Challenges: Developing a comprehensive emergency plan to revert to alternative (i.e., laboratory -based or online) clinical nursing training experiences if the hospital and other clinical settings refuse to take students due to COVID -19 or the environment is deemed unsafe for students and faculty. Obtaining adequate PPE for students and faculty in the laboratory and clinical setting . In March 2020, the New Mexico Nurses Association conducted a survey of 1,35 2 nurses across the state about their work during Binder Page: Page 270 of 8106.

Coordinating the advising and tracking of over 800 pre -nursing students with the Center for Academic Advising and Student Success. 7. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? The Nurse Expansion program at NMSU addresses Governor Lujan Grisham's number one workforce priority in 2019 and 2020 , which is to increase the num ber of registered nurses available to fill New Mexico's critical vacancies . Since its inception in 2005, the Nurse Expansion program at NMSU has graduated over 2000 nurses. Currently , the pro gram graduates approximately 125 new nurse s each year. Over the past three years, approximate 70% of NMSU BSN graduates have sought initial licensing as an R N in New Mexico. The School of Nursing is a founding member and active leader in the New Mexico NMNEC partnership, which has established a common nursing curriculum across the state so that colleges and universities can educate nurses at the BSN level. This initiative also allows colleges throughout the state to offer bachelor's degrees in nursing in their own communities - keeping more aspiring nurses in rural areas and ending the requirement that they move to an urban area to attain their higher education. 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? The College of Health & Social Services obtained a $400,000 donation from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico for nursing student scholarships and a 3 -year Professor of Practice position for a nursing faculty. The goal of this professorship is to increase the number of BSN graduates in the region and state. In 2019, the School of Nursing was awarded two federal training grant s, a $1.35 million grant from the Health Research and Services Administration (HRSA) and a $200,000 grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Both are training grants geared towards improving the education and training for Nurse Practitioners in the prevention, identificatio n, and treatment of opioid and other substance use disorders. Funds from these awards are not available to assist with the BSN enrollment g rowth and program support outlined in this expansion request, but do support faculty development in the areas of substance use disorders and telehealth/telemedicine. 9. Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) NMSU continues to expand enrollment in the BSN program, while maintaining excellence in nursing education, as well as retention and graduation rates. NMSU provides a critical pipeline to a career in nursing for students from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds.

Does the RPSP align with the NMSU Mission? (Check all that apply) Research Public Service Teaching 2. Explain below how the program aligns with the mission. Answer is limited to the box below. This program addresses the NMSU LEADS 2025 Strategic Goal 1: Enhance Student Success and Social Mobility . A BSN degree from NMSU provides great opportunity for a career pathway and social mobility due to our high student retention/graduation rates, near -100% employment rates , and the high earning potential of nurses (average New Mexico RN salary in 2017 was $ 69,000/year). Through our efforts across three campuse s (Alamogordo, Grants, and Las Cruces), NMSU is a leader in addressing New Mexico's nursing shortage, which in Fall 2019 included over 3500 RN vacancies across the state. Graduating prepared nurses during a pandemic is especially important, as nurses are a vital link between the patient and the rest of the health care team. The School of Nursing has targeted outreach initiatives to high schools across the state and is building a partnership with the statewide NMSU 4 -H programs for the purpose of community education on health topics and recruitment. The School of Nursing has a long history of working with campus ROTC and other military programs to facilitate a pathway to a career in military nursing. In addition, the BSN program has an accelerated pathway for individuals who have a degree in another field, allowing them to graduate with a second baccalaureate degree and sit for the NCLEX -RN exam in 1.5 years. With its diverse student body ( approximately 70% from under -represented racial and ethnic minority populations, 5 0% first generation college students, 40% from rural counties in New Mexico) and a curriculum that emphasizes health disparities and social justice, the BSN program fosters diversity and inclusion. Finally, the School of Nursing provides financial support and faculty advising to its Student Nurses Association (approximately 1/3 of the BSN students are active members) . The Student Nurses Association provides hundr eds of hours of community service and outreach, and in 2019 received a national award for its efforts to recruit members of the public to join the national bone marrow registry. (Note - The Nurse Expansion program also addresses Goal 3 - see section 5) This program also addresses the NMSU LEADS 2025 Strategic Goal 4: Building a Robust University System by attract ing a diverse array of students, with approximately 70 % of the student body reporting being from minority and under -represented backgrounds. T he BSN program also has several initiatives that provide enhanced support for first generation college students. These include a Living Learning Communities with a pre -nursing Freshman seminar and a partnership with the College Assistance Migrant Program ( CAMP). The BSN program has a BSN student success coordinator who supports student preparation for the RN licensing exam (NCLEX -RN) that BSN graduates must pass in order to gain employment as a nurse. Cultivating faculty and staff excellence , also part of Goal 4, is essential for maintaining our graduation and licensing exam pass rates, which in turn contribute s additional nurses to reduce the nursing workforce shortage in New Mexico. This program funding supports faculty and staff development in teaching, advising, curriculum/program evaluation, NCLEX -RN exam preparation, leadership and teaching -based research/scholarship. Students are directly impacted when faculty and staff professional development leads to improved teaching/learning, better program support, and improved preparation for the NCLEX -RN exam.

Short Program Summary: Provide a short description of what the program does, i.e. Mission, scope, how the program benefits the state, or what challenge/need it addresses. The program summary is limited to the box below. It will be used as a description in submissions to the board of Regents, NMSU administration, the Higher Education Department or the Governor's Office. Our mission at the School of Nursing is to promote health and improve the quality of life of the people of New Mexico through nursi ng education, research, practice and public service, recognizing the state's multicultural heritage and dynamic border environment. RPSP funding supports initiatives to meet a critical state- wide demand for baccalaureate -prepared RNs. The NMSU School of Nursing provides New Mexico hospitals and other clinical agencies with a pipeline of new nursing graduates . A BSN degree from NMS U provides great opportunity for social mobility due to our near- 100% graduate employment rates and the high earning potential of nurses (average New Mexico RN salary in 2017 wa s $69,000/year). Graduating prepared nurses during a pandemic is especially important, as nurses are a vital link between the patient and the rest of the health care team. The NMSU nursing program collaborates with its higher education partners across the state to deliver a common curriculum that allows nursing students to easi ly move from community college to university level courses. In New Mexico, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) consists of 3 semesters of nursing pre - requisite coursework, followed by 5 semesters of nursing courses with 840 hours of clinical training. In addition to the Las Cruces campus, NMSU delivers the BSN program to students at the NMSU -Alamogordo and NMSU -Grants campuses. Having students from the Grants and Alamogordo communities complete their nursing education in their rural hometown increases the likelihood that they will remain in the region upon graduation. 4.

Shape the Future. Actual: $256,600 FY 22 Request: Mexico State University leads the Sunspot Solar Observatory (SSO) consortium in operating the world -renowned Dunn Solar Telescope and surrounding facilities that sit atop Sacramento Peak in Sunspot, NM. This is one of the preeminent places for studying the Sun. The project brings about $1.2 million of revenue into the state annually. The National Science Foundation (NSF) provides 50% and NMSU, with commitments from the state of New Mexico, consortium partners, and grants, provides the other 50%. This project strengthens the state's leadership in astrophysics and geospace research, enhances PhD student research and recruitment, improve a popular education and public outreach visitor center, and retain high -paying jobs in Otero CountyThe SSO oversees scientific and educational directives for the project, and its ongoing success depends on each consortium partner, including NMSU, to provide its own investment during operations. In FY22, we will continue to lead the SSOC, employ and train telescope personnel, provide for scientific and student research, employ and train STEM outreach personnel and organize STEM outreach events. State funding is used to enable NMSU to lead this project. All telescope personnel are NMSU employees and contribute to the mission of the university to serve the diverse needs of the state through education, research, extension, outreach, and public service. Putting New Mexico at the Forefront NMSU, together with the NSO and the NSF, lead the consortium of US and international universities and institutes dedicated to funding and operating the facility over the next decade. This leadership places NMSU in a national forefront role in addressing the global challenges of space weather and solar astronomy, subjects of tremendous interest to NSF, NASA, DoD, and DoE. This directly retains high -paying jobs in Otero County and provides indirect economic benefits to the local region. Beyond maintaining about 10 FTE at the site, annual meetings and workshops will bring over 100 week- long scientists into the area from out of state, and about 15,000 public visitors.

Employ and train telescope personnel: supply mission -critical staff to continue development of scientific and educational operation plans for the site. Provide for scientific research: provide for graduate recruitment and retention opportunities and Employ and train STEM outreach personnel: Lead this premier STEM visitors center for the public. Sunspot Astronomy and Visitor Center Due to strong public interest in astronomy and the many visitors to astronomy facilities, the Sunspot Astronomy and Visitor Center opened its doors on Sacramento Peak in 1997. It is the result of a collaboration between the NSO/Sacramento Peak, Apache Point Observatory, and the USDA Forest Service. The Visitor Center attracts about 15,000 visitors per year.Leveraged funds Located at Sunspot, NM, the Dunn Solar Telescope specializes in high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy that allows astronomers worldwide to obtain a better understanding of the Sun and how space weather impacts Earth. The Dunn telescope continues to provide a versatile and user -friendly set - up to investigate a range of solar activity and provides a testbed for developing cutting- edge technologies. This projects leverages $600,000 of state and partner funding, matching the $600,000 annual investment of NSF. In leading this project, NMSU Astronomy has successfully won several other grants. In 2019, NSF awarded a $1,449,022 5-year grant to NMSU to hire a new faculty member and provide for research start -up costs including graduate students. In 2019 a 3-year $368,015 grant was awarded to NMSU from NSF, in addition to a $212,000 grant from NSO, to fund additional student and postdoctoral research on solar filament eruptions. In 2020, the availability of data from the DST led to two NASA grants totaling $70,000 per year. One of these is to provide support data for the Parker Solar Probe instrument as it fly through the Sun's atmosphere. The second is become part of a major NASA research 'DRIVE' initiative lead by UCLA that will result in a second larger proposal to NASA in the fall of 2021. NMSU involvement in both these projects is only possible because of our leadership in SSO Binder Page: Page 282 of 810NEW MEXICO HIGHER EDUCATION DEPARTMENT Research & Public Service Projects (RPSP) FY 2022 Institution: NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY Name/Title of Project Sunspot Solar Observatory Indicate Type (X): New Continuing Expansion Final (Ending/Closing) FY22 Funding Request ($XXX,XXX) : 256,600 If Previously Funded, Amount that was awarded in FY21 ($XXX,XXX): 256,600 Type of Project (X for Type) Research Public Service Academic Athletics Clinical Economic Development Other (Explain Below) Please explain if other is marked: Click or tap here to enter text. 1.Number of years the project has received General Fund support ( Disregard if new program):3 2.Project Description / Executive Summary : The goal of this RPSP is to continue to promote NMSU and the State of NM to lead the consortium in operating the solar astronomical research facilities at Sunspot, Otero County. This operation has an annual expenditure of ~$1.2M in New Mexico, strengthens the state role as a leader in astronomical and geospace research, enhances PhD student recruitment for NMSU, improves a popular astronomical education and public outreach site, and retains high- paid jobs in Otero County. With an operating consortium and associated funding, the facility, which was slated for closure in 2017, now continues to prosper. NMSU leads the consortium for the benefit of New Mexico in areas of scientific research of critical national importance, student training and education, advanced instrumentation, economic impacts to the state, and public outreach. In FY2 2, we will continue to lead efforts to employ observatory staff, provide graduate student training , and enrich our public outreach Program . 3.Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) In FY2 2, we will employ 4.5 FTES as part of the 1 1 FTE team to provide for scientific research, education, and public outreach in Sunspot. All FY22 requested budget is for NMSU personnel wages and fringes . For FY2 1, this project received $273,000, reduced by 6% to $256,600 in the special session. F or FY2 2, our request is is a flat continuing budget of $256,600 . Binder Page: Page 283 of 810 4. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): As our closest star, the Sun is a critical plasma and astrophysical laboratory. As such it acts to test all our knowledge of plasma (including nuclear fusion) and other stars. As the dominant external influence on Earth, the tremendous energy generated by the Sun can be suddenly and spontaneously released, sending radiation and high-e nergy particles to Earth that wreak havoc with communication satellites and power grids. Th ese Space Weather effects are a combination of physics, astrophysics, and geophysics that makes studies of the Sun of fundamental importance to national funding agencies, including NASA, NSF, DOD and DOE. The Sunspot Solar Observatory has ru n the Dunn Solar Telescope as a U.S. site for this interdisciplinary solar physics research at Sunspot, NM for over 4 years. In 2016, the previous operator, NSO, began to move most personnel to operate a new solar telescope. In 2017, the international research community recognized that facilities at Sunspot continue to be of significant scientific value and started the Sunspot Solar Observatory consortium. Since 2018, the state of New Mexico has invested in the scientific research and public outreach of the consortium in order to reinvent the facility to enable science, education, and public outreach focused on our nearest star. NMSU lead s this consortium of national and international universities and institutes dedicated to funding and operating the facility. NMSU leads and directs the project that brings about $1.2M annually into the state. This retains high -paying jobs in Otero County, and provides economic tourism benefits to the local region. Beyond maintaining about 1 1 FTE at the site, annual meetings and workshops bring over 100 visitors to the area from out of state, and 50 scientists and engineers visit the facility each year for research and technical dev elopment. In total, using all available sources of funding in the consortium, the SSO fund 3 personnel at the telescope, 2 at the visitor's center, 2 at NMSU, and NSF continue to fund 4 personnel for site operations. The SSO manages daily observing at th e telescope, provides these data to the scientific community, operates a critical training facility with high -tech instrumentation for future scientists and engineers, contributes to a national graduate education program in solar physics, and operates the visitor center to attract about 15,000 visitors per year. No other facility in the country provides this combination of opportunities. 5. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) In FY2 2 the 5 objectives of this RPSP are to continue to lead the consortium, employ and train telescope personnel, provide for scientific and student research at the telescope, employ and train STEM outreach personnel, and organize STEM outreach events . 6. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. Given the science, instrumentation, and educational opportuni ties afforded by continued operation of the DST, the Sunspot Solar Observatory, consisting of a consortium of several academic institutions and the NSF, provides for scientific research and public outreach centered on solar physics and space weather. In FY 20, we ha d three NMSU graduate student using data from the telescope for their thesis research , have 5 ongoing MOU s, won a new NSF grant for FY20 and FY21, and hosted a NSF site visit. At this visit NSF recommit ted to their overall responsibility for the operations permit for the site, that includes $ 350,000/yr to NSO to retain their 4 staff at the site and a contribution of $250,000/yr to the consortium . Together this means that NSF contribute $600,000 to the project each year. Our partners, the Calif ornia State University Northridge and University of Colorado , together with NMSU, contributes $115,000 per year. In FY20, w e won 2 new NASA grants, each for about $35,000/yr. We have a new data server and computing resources, resident in computing science building at NMSU, which have been designed to supply all our computing needs for the next 5 years. The major obstacle to our suc cess in FY20 was the site closure due to COVID19 restrictions. We were closed from March 2020 to June 2020. This adversely affected ou r visitor numbers and visitor center income (which were both on track for a 35% increase), our professional visitor total, and our number of STEM and publi c outreach events. We have mitigated these effects by using this time to improve aspects of the project's long term viability. We redesigned computer control boards for Binder Page: Page 284 of 8106.

We have enhanced the visitor experience through new exhibits and creat ed a new audio tour of the site. 7. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? The initial endeavor to lead the formation of the Sunspot Solar Observatory consortium made NMSU a new national hotspot for solar physics research. Leading this consortium to operate the Sunspot site now contributes directly to training and jobs in critica l STEM areas in New Mexico. The major state research centers of Sandia, LANL, and AFRL are all concerned with replenishing their workforces with young, well -trained workers with precisely the set of STEM skills that the project provides and NMSU now has an education agreement and strong personal research connection with all three centers . The Sunspot site provides a unique setting for interdisciplinary research across the nation. For students in areas of space science, astrophys ics, engineering and compute r science, Sunspot offers a real -life research opportunity as part of their degree. In leading the program to retain and enhance Sunspot as a site for scientific discovery, we impact the local community with 11 high -paying jobs in Otero County, and attracting visitor dollars to the area. The Sunspot visitor center provides outreach to the public and K-12 students, attracting ~15,000 visitors annually . 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? In our ongoing MOU with NSF, beginn ing October 2019, they provide about $350,000/yr channeled through NSO to retain site personnel, and $250,000/yr to NMSU as their contribution to fund scientific operations. In FY20 and FY21, University partners provide an additional $2 30,000 to NMSU to obtain their own observation . In FY20, Dr McAteer won to additional grants (total of $70,000/yr) in which Sunspot is a 'Phase I' partner in two nationwide efforts funded by NASA. One of these, led by UCLA , will be turned into a larger 5 year Phase II proposal in FY22. Leading this Sunspot Solar Observatory consortium enables NMSU to obtain more research funding success. In FY19, NMSU Astronomy (PI McAteer) was awarded a $394,000 (3- year) science proposal from NSF, and a $212,000 (3 -year) science proposal from NSO to fund student and postdoctoral research at NMSU to perform scientific research with the data from Sunspot and provide new space -weather data products to the community. In August 2019, NMSU Astr onomy was awarded a $1.5million (5- year) faculty development grant from NSF to provide for a new tenure- track faculty position at NMSU (including all start -up funds), with a focus on connecting SSO research to other new national facilities and space weathe r prediction. In FY20, NMSU was awarded a $350,000 NASA grant to build a new instrument in Sunspot to observe Jupiter. This provides complementary solar system observations with international partners and graduate student participation, in addition to interdisciplinary instrument development with the NMSU College of Engineering. Each of t hese g rants are key contributions to NMSU as it seeks to obtain Carnegie -R1 status , and are only possible due to our leadership in Sunspot. In FY 20, the visitor center brought in $59,000 in admission and purchases . All visitor center income is redirected back into community outreach and enhanced visitor experience at the site. We stress that the continued NSF financial investment in Sunspot is dependent on NMSU obtaining RPSP funds. In return, we fully expect that continued state funding should be dependent on continuing NSF funds . Only by working together can we retain the 1 1FTES on site, provide scientific research opportunities, and fully utilize the Visitor Center to attract tourists to the area. 9.

Number of years the project has received General Fund support ( Disregard if new program): 51 2. Project Description / Executive Summary : Since its creation in 1963, NM WRRI has been the state's nucleus for coordinating water resources research among university faculty statewide. Due to the continuing need for research and training related to water scarcity and other critical water issues in New Mexico, NM WRRI has received Research and Public Service Project general fund support for 51 years. NM WRRI will continue to work to provide new tools for addressing New Mexico's myriad water problems. Funding in recent years has allowed for the development of powerful new tools to account for existing water in New Mexico. The institute is now operationalizing critical work begun in FY15 to develop a Statewide Water Ass essment that complements the existing state's tabulations every five years of water use attached to water rights. A version of the New Mexico Dynamic Statewide Water Budget (NMDSWB) model is available on the NM WRRI website. The model synthesizes water sup ply and demand information; provides easy to access data at a variety of spatial scales (county and/or water planning regions); produces a holistic view of water resources and user- defined future scenarios; and supports local, regional, and statewide water planning. State funding has also funded: faculty and student water research grants statewide; coordination and data acquisition to obtain, process, synthesize, and Binder Page: Page 299 of 8102. Project Description / Executive Summary : deliver data; and improved water management through enhanced water use estimates in agricul tural areas starting with the Lower Rio Grande. Recurring funding of $1.064M is requested for FY22. This funding will continue to support the Community Hydrology Program that funds research on NM surface water -groundwater interactions in communities of the Upper Rio Grande, the Estancia Basin, the Lower Rio Grande, and other critical sites. In FY20, NM WRRI began a new initiative, New Mexico Universities Produced Water Synthesis Project (NMUPWSP), leading the effort on produced water assessment, water and energy analysis, and spatial systems modeling with considerations of treatment and transportation costs, reuse applications, municipal supplies, and water agreements. Recurring funding will continue to support the NMDSWB responding to stakeholder needs fo r quantitative data providing future scenarios for population growth, Ag and M&I water- use efficiency, and management decisions for protecting water in New Mexico. 3.

Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): The NM WRRI was created in 1963 as a statewide program supporting the state's water research at NMSU, UNM, and NM Tech. In 2005, the state legislature gave NM WRRI statutory authority (NMSA 1978 21 -8-40). The institute was approved under the 1964 federal W ater Resources Research Act and is one of 54 water institutes nationwide, with an institute in each state plus three territories and the District of Columbia. The 1964 law was introduced by NM Sen. Clinton P. Anderson and was modeled on the NM WRRI. It is located at its land grant college and is the nucleus for coordinating water resources research in the state. The overall mission is to develop and disseminate knowledge that will assist the state and nation in solving water problems. Water managers and use rs throughout the area rely upon the institute for objective, timely scientific information, and new technologies for water management. Users and beneficiaries are local, city, and county government, local water agencies, water user organizations, state ag encies, and New Mexico universities. NM WRRI helps NM solve its water problems statewide; supports research at NMSU, UNM, NM Tech, Eastern, Western, Highlands and Northern NMC; applies research findings in small communities for local water supply sustain ability; identifies new water sources such as untapped groundwater; identifies new technology for small communities to treat brackish groundwater; and develops a hydrological accurate and dynamic up -to-the-minute statewide water budget. The NM WRRI has adm inistered over 453 research projects; funded over 332 state faculty; provided training for over 2,616 university students; and produced over 427 technical and miscellaneous reports. FY22 funding will support the ongoing research on surface water and ground water as communities continue to face issues related to water scarcity and drought, as well as improve NM's ability to respond to changing water conditions through an easily accessible Statewide Water Assessment, utilizing state -of-the-art data streams fro m remote sensing and new data networks to show current water conditions. The development of the statewide water budget includes the state's water use diversity: acequias, pueblos, groundwater extractors, river corridor users, and rangeland producers among others. The statewide water budget project coordinates efforts among NM's water management agencies. The water budget resource will be made available to researchers to Binder Page: Page 300 of 8104. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): support cutting -edge multidisciplinary water research, and will include all water inputs and outputs to the state to enable hydrology -based water planning. A downloadable version of the dynamic systems model is available on the NM WRRI website and enables scenario testing by planners and scientists for managing existing water and developing n ew water. Every sector of New Mexico's economy, including jobs, education, culture, and health relies on available and good quality water. 5. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) Research: NM WRRI funding supports faculty and student water -related research at the state's major research universities and at the four -year colleges thereby benefitting faculty and students statewide. It supports research in both water quality and water quantity, and in water planning, management, and coordination. NM WRRI funding helps graduate degree programs primarily at NMSU, NM Tech, and UNM. The NM WRRI will continue to administer water- related research and participate in collaborative research efforts, thereby complementing water research statewide and leveraging funds to attract federal and private funding. Public Service: Limited water resources and current drought conditions in NM require the highest quality research to solve its water -related problems. For decades, the NM WRRI has been a leader in water research. Ultimately, the citizens of NM are the primary beneficiaries of the services provided by NM WRRI. Teaching: Training undergraduate and graduate students at NM's universities is a core mission of the NM WRRI and is inst rumental in preparing students to become our future water resources scientists, technicians, and managers. Grants provide students with opportunities for hands -on experience in both the lab and in the field to better prepare them with the skill sets needed to successfully complete degree programs and move into New Mexico's job sector. 6. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challe nges for the current FY. FY19 -21 Provided 52 student water research awards across the state supporting at least 81 students. FY22 funding will support at 8 faculty and staff researchers and 20 students. Six years ago, water planning stakeholders requested better information on NM's water budget in order to ameliorate impacts of drought. NM WRRI responded and built the NM Dynamic Statewide Water Budget (DSWB). The DSWB brings together over 30 million data points in a single easy to access tool that describes the major flows and reservoirs of water in NM. The DSWB helps counties, water planning regions, and the state access data that were never before compiled in a single location, and it runs scenarios of future water supplies based on management decisions. The Statewide Water Assessment includes continued updates to the following two main projects: Comparison of Operational Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Products. The overall study goal is to develop a procedure for a cost -effective assessment of existing precipitation and evapotranspiration products at spatial and temporal scales needed by New Mexico's water resources managers. Specifically, objectives are: 1) Compare and contrast the five precipitation and three evapotranspiration products and quantify biases present over the entire state and over specific ecological climate zones; 2) Validate each product against reliable measurements; 3) Validate two existing methods for assessment of the reference ET for the New Mexico environment. The NM Dynamic Statewide Water Budget synthesizes water supply and demand information from across the Binder Page: Page 301 of 8106. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challe nges for the current FY. state into a single, easily accessible location, and in such a way that users can view information at a variety of spatial scales. The DSWB provides a holistic view of water resources in the state, helping to support local and regional education as well as planning, to improve stewardship of New Mexico's limited and critically important water resources. Research and creative activity to address local and global challenges are facilitated with the NMDSWB project, which involves two PhD students who update and maintain the NMDSWB with the latest data from OSE and USGS including water use and hydroclimate data and evaluating the Drought Monitor Index using NMDSWB. The NMDSWB project has also amplified the impact of research findings by addressing local needs that align with global challenges, some of the ways include: Comparing operational precipitation and evapotranspiration products for their usefulness at various spatial scales Developing interdisciplinary system dynamics models as offshoots of the New Mexico Dynamic Statewide Water Budget (NMDSWB) model Assessing local and regional data received from stakeholders, experts, and decision makers through the offshoot modeling process for accuracy and appropriateness for updating the NMDSWB Developing new drought index specific to climatic and physical conditions in New Mexico Providing online access to model and associated data to a large audience FY21 Community Hydro logy Program offered a program tightly integrated with efforts related to research, service, and outreach. The program, which supports research on surface water and groundwater in the Upper Rio Grande, the Estancia Basin, and other critical sites where communities continue to face issues related to water scarcity and drought, elevated graduate education and provided experience with outreach by maintaining constant communication which connected university and local individuals and groups. This also built a p latform of trust with local communities relevant for implementing projects to address research questions. The New Mexico Universities Produced Water Synthesis Project, an effort on produced water in eastern New Mexico that includes participation from UNM (regulatory aspects),NMT (produced water database), and NMSU, (project lead, produced water assessment, water and energy analysis, spatial data visualization, low cost treatment, and reuse applications for agriculture, fracking, municipal supplies, and reg ional water agreements) amplified impacts of research findings through collaboration with experts from other New Mexico research universities and from industry partners throughout the development of the model through formal interviews, as well as establishing working relationships within the oil and gas industry. 7.

Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? into NM's job sector. Students work under the guidance of accomplished and knowledgeable faculty researchers. Funding through NM WRRI allows faculty and students to present research results at regional, national, and international forums; to disseminate research results through academic and other publications; to secure additional funding from federal, state, and private sources thereby helping to retain students; and can also provide working positions with water agency staff allow ing students entry opportunities into New Mexico's workforce. Many student recipients of NM WRRI grants are now established university faculty and federal laboratory scientists as well as technicians and experts at every level of local, state, and federal agencies. They are also well represented in private water- related industry. These projects will gather, process, analyze, and deliver the data to NM communities for better water management based on their own community -provided needs. The NMDSWB will develop public -private collaborative research and implementation projects with land managers in New Mexico to enhance community resilience. Findings and analyses related to the Community Hydrology Program will help identify specific infrastructural problem s and needs that must be targeted for more accurate data, and by involving non -scientist individuals into the project introduces diversity of local knowledge, supports adaptive management, builds resilience, and addresses water resource risk management. Th e New Mexico Universities Produced Water Synthesis Project works closely with at least three state agencies to inform solutions to water scarcity and water quality using technology and community involvement to better treat and utilize produced water. The N M research university expertise will be complemented with private sector on the ground input to provide cutting- edge research for effective new approaches to produced water. These projects will enhance the Governor's initiative on the Center of Excellence in Sustainable Food and Agriculture Systems by supporting water systems research to better integrate multidisciplinary research and applied solutions. This project will support the Governor's 50 -year water plan initiative through efforts to improve regional water planning based on stakeholder involvement in integrated water resources studies in collaboration with the Office of the State Engineer 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from othe r sources? NM WRRI assists faculty in obtaining support for their water -related projects from external sources and often administers these projects. During the period July 1, 2019 -June 30, 2020, NM WRRI managed eight externally funded awards. The institute administered 26 projects as a result of the eight externally funded awards issued to NM WRRI. The primary research focus of the projects centered around water quality and water planning, and management issues. Agencies providing support included the National Science Foundation (NSF), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), New Mexico Environment Department, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the National Park Service. Agencies award funding to researchers via the NM WRRI , which administers the projects. The institute director and staff participate in proposal development to secure funding whenever opportunities arise. These efforts are often multi- university and interdisciplinary projects. In the past year, nine proposals were developed which sought funding from Bureau of Reclamation, National Science Foundation, United States Department of Agriculture, New Mexico Environment Department, Department Binder Page: Page 303 of 8108.

Shape the Future. Program Accomplishments Doubled program enrollment in the past two years (currently have 56 students enrolled) Obtained $1.5 million in federal training grant funding to support education and training in the area of opioid and other substance use disorder evaluation, treatment and recovery services. DNP students complete a scholarly project that addresses a patient - focused practice issue in psychiatric mental health care. Admission preference to the NMSU PMHNP pr ogram is given to NM residents 2021 Overview There continues to be a critical need for mental health services in New Mexico, particularly in underserved and rural areas. Meeting those needs is a priority for the NMSU School of Nursing (SON). Funding from the Research and Public Service Projects has supported the Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) specialty track in the three -year Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program. The School of Nursing also offers a post -graduate certificate for nurse practitioners in other specialities that, in one year, allows them to sit for the PMHNP certification exam. RPSP funds have been used to hire qualified faculty and student advisors, support innovative clinical training activities, provide professional development for faculty, and for student stipends. Many students in this program participate in clinical experiences in rural and other underserved areas throughout New Mexico. A new focus of the PMHNP program is opioid use disorder prevention, treatment and recovery. Binder Page: Page 317 of 810Leaders in Opioid Use Disorder Education and Training Leaders in Telemental Health Education and Training The NMSU School of Nursing is one of the few health professional programs south of Socorro that has incorporated telehealth technology into the curriculum for all nurse practitioner students. Telehealth is the use of telecommunications technology to provide health care and patient health- related education at a distance. Telehealth improves health care service to remote locations or environments without clinic facilities. All nurse practitioner students are trained on the use of telehealth equipment and in telehealth delivery protocols. The NMSU School of Nursing faculty and students are actively engaged in delivering mental/ behavioral health services to students at a school in Chaparral, NM using telehealth technology.The SON received a 3 -year, $1.35 million HRSA Opioid Workforce Education Program grant in September 2019 titled 'Expanding the New Mexico SUD/OUD Treatment and Prevention Workforce through Interprofessional Education and Training'. This project is an interdisciplinary collaboration with the Counseling Education Psychology PhD and the Master's of Social Work programs. The overall goal of the project is to increase the number of professionals in the state of New Mexico, and in particular the Southern New Mexico counties, who are trained in interprofessional settings to effectively prevent and treat opioid use disorder (OUD) and other substance abuse disorders (SUD) in community -based practices.

Number of years the project has received General Fund support ( Disregard if new program): 13 2. Project Description / Executive Summary : RPSP funding supports the NMSU psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner (PMHNP) program, which is delivered in a distance education format to nurses throughout the State of New Mexico. This program supports initiatives to meet a critical state -wide dem and for highly trained mental health care providers. The 3 -year Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) graduate degree program prepares nurses to take a national certification exam that will allow them to provide comprehensive mental health services, including mental health evaluation, diagno sis and treatment , as well as providing psychotherapy/counselling. Certified PMHNPs have legal authority to prescribe psychoactive medications and the adjunctive pharmacological agents that ameliorate side effects of these medications . Nurse practitioners with other specializations (e.g., family nurse practitioner) can complete NMSU's 1-year PMHNP post graduate certificate program which provides eligibility to sit for the PMHNP certification exam. Students in the PMHNP DNP and certificate programs are also trained to deliver tele -mental health services, which is a key solution for delivering mental health services to residents in rural communities. The PMHNP program is offered through distance education, whi ch allows students to remain in their communities, practicing as a nurse while Binder Page: Page 319 of 8102. Project Description / Executive Summary : earning their DNP degree. RPSP funding provides critical support and career advancement opportunities to students from rural and medically underserved communities in New Mexico. Mental Health Nurse Practitioner funds support nursing faculty salaries and professional development, student support services, graduate student stipends, as well as equipment and software to improve the quality and efficiency of delivering nursing educat ion. 3. Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) Currently, Mental Health funding is used for: Faculty and professional staff salaries - In clinical courses, the nationally mandated ratio of nurse prac titioner faculty:student is 1:6. Faculty professional development - required for nurse practitioner re -certification PMHNP student stipends during the clinical training year - provides support for tuition and other educational expenses during the third year in the DNP program (or firs t year in the certificate program) when students complete 780 hours of clinical training. Medical equipment for clinical assessment training Guest lecturers, equipment and other resources for nurse practitioner 'bootcamp' - a 1 week clinical training required by the program accreditation agency Program market ing and advertising - required to maintain program enrollment and recruit potential st udents from rural counties in New Mexico. 4. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): Our mission at the School of Nursing (SON) is to promote health and improve the quality of life of the people of New Mexico through nursing education, research, practice and public service, recognizing the state's multicultural heritage and dynamic border environment. The m ission of the Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) program at New Mexico State University is to educate nurses for the advanced practice role with the goal of increasing access to mental health services for the res idents of New Mexico. The RPSP funding received by the School of Nursing from the New Mexico legislature is the primary sources of funding for this important program. Once certified as a PMHNP, our graduates are qualified to provide comprehensive mental he alth services, including mental health diagno sis, prescribing medications, and psychotherapy/counsel ing. A recent addition to the curriculum is enhanced education and training on opioid and other substance use disorder, including the delivery of prevention , treatment and recovery services. The Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner program prepares nurses for advanced practice with a focus on mental health issues across the lifespan. The curriculum builds upon four core PMHNP competencies: advanced health assessment (physical and psychosocial); diagnosis (diagnosis of mental disorders, pathophysiology, and neurophysiology); psychotherapy (individual, group, and family); and medication management (pharmacology and psychopharmacology). Other courses de velop competencies in health care systems, best- practice research utilization and translation, and health care quality improvement. Graduates are prepared to sit for the Psychiatric/Mental Health Nurse Practitioner certification exam through the American N urses Credentialing Center (ANCC). PMHNPs assess the mental health needs of individuals, families, and groups. They formulate healthcare plans, implement treatment, and evaluate the effectiveness of short - and long- term progress. Although PMHNPs have independent practice in New Mexico, they often collaborate with physicians and other health professionals in the treatment of complex mental health disord ers. This funding mechanism supports the education for students from rural and medically underserved a reas in New Mexico and provide them the opportunity to obtain an advanced nursing practice degree. The continuation of funding allows the SON to sustain this past year's enrollment growth and the awarding of stipends to PMHNP students who commit to living in New Binder Page: Page 320 of 8104. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): Mexico for three -year s post -graduation. Since the majority of our students are working RNs, our distance education format allows them to pursue an advanced degree, while continuing to live and work in their home communities. Lastly, the SON is one of the few health professional programs south of Socorro that has incorporated telehealth technology into the curricula for our nurse practitioner students. Telemedicine is the use of telecommunication technology to support long distance clinical health care, patient and professional health -related education, public health and community health, health systems development and epidemiology. Telemedicine improves health care service availability in remote or difficult to operate environments. The PMHNP faculty and students are actively engaged in delivering \"Teen Health\" services through telehealth to Las Cruces, Onate, Chaparral, and Gadsden high schools with plans to expand to other area schools. 5.

For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. Obstacles: Recruiting PMHNP students from rural counties in New Mexico Recruiting and retaining qualified PMHNP faculty due to salaries that are lower than the market average. 7. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? The Mental Health RPSP program at NMSU addresses one of Governor Lujan Grisham's workforce priorities in 2019, which is to rebuild the mental health provider network in New Mexico to fill critical vacancies throughout the state, especially in rural communities. New Mexico has some of the highest incidence of opioid and other illicit drug use in the country, greatest need for mental health providers, and some of the most extreme health disparities in the nation. The vast majority of counties in New Mexico have been des ignated a mental health geographic Health Professional Shortage Area by the Health Research and Services Administration (HRSA). Over the past three years, between 43 -60% of NMSU PMHNP graduates have remain ed in New Mexico following graduation. Currently 50% of students enrolled in the PMHNP DNP and certificate pr ograms are New Mexico residents with many providing mental health services to rural and underserved communities throughout the state. 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? The SON received a 3 -year, $1.35 million HRSA Opioid Workforce Education Program grant in September 2019 titled 'Expanding the New Mexico SUD/OUD Treatment and Prevention Workforce through In terprofessional Education and Training.' This project is an interdisciplinary collaboration with the Counseling Education Psychology PhD and the Master's of Social Work programs. This project highlights the direction that the PMHNP program is taking in order to help the State of New Mexico address the current opioid crisis. The project objectives are to: 1. Develop and implement interdisciplinary training experiences with PMHNP and counseling psychology doctoral students, and Master's of Social Work students, to promote the integration of behavioral health with primary care, including trauma -informed care, with a focus on working with OUD and other SUD prevention, treatment and recovery services; 2. Enhance knowledge and competencies around evidence -supp orted prevention and treatment modalities used in integrated and team -based practices for OUD and other SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery services for PMHNP, counseling psychology, and social work students; 3. Increase the number of community -based e xperiential training sites to help meet the behavioral health needs of persons in high need and high demand areas who have, or are at risk for, OUD and other SUD, including children, adolescents, and transitional- age youth; 4. Provide professional developm ent opportunities in the area of in the area of OUD and other SUD, including Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA -waive) Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) for nursing, counseling, and social work faculty, as well as preceptors. Binder Page: Page 322 of 8108. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? The SON received an additional 2 -year, $200,000 training grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in April 2020 titled, 'Integrating Competencies in SUD Prevention, Screening and Treatment throughout a Family Nurse Practitioner Curriculum in the Rural U.S. -Mexico Border Region'. The project objectives are to: 1. Increase the number of faculty at NMSU and other regional FNP programs who have the knowledge and expertise to deliver an integrated OUD/SUD curriculum with enhanced content on non -opioid alternatives for acute and chronic pain management. 2. Increase the number of FNPs in New Mexico and the surrounding border region who are trained to effectively identify, evaluate and treat all forms of SUD and prevent OUD through acute/chronic pain assessment and management using non -opioid alternatives. 3. Increase the number of evidence -based test questions on the topics of OUD and other SUD on the American Nurse Credentialing Center FNP certification exam. The College of Health & Social Services obtained a $400,000 donation from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico for nurse practitioner and nursing student scholarships and a 3 -year Professor of Practice position for a nursing faculty. The goal of this professorship is to increase the number of nursing and nurse practitioner graduates in the region and state. 9. Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) Each year NMSU continues to expand enrollment in the PMHNP program, while maintaining excellence in nursing education, as well as retention and graduation rates. NMSU provides a critical pipeline to a career as a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, with t he only doctoral- level program in the state. NMSU is a state -wide leader in education and training in the area of integrated primary health and mental health care. NMSU supports Governor Lujan Grisham and Workforce Solution's efforts to address the menta l health workforce shortage in New Mexico and expand the pipeline to healthcare careers that offer extraordinary social and economic mobility.

Does the RPSP align with the NMSU Mission? (Check all that apply) Research Public Service Teaching 2. Explain below how the program aligns with the mission. Answer is limited to the box below. This program addresses the NMSU LEADS 2025 Strategic Goal 1: Enhance Student Success and Social Mobility. The psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner (PMHNP) program provides great opportunity for social mobility and elevates graduate education through our high graduation rates, 100% employment rates and the high earning potential of PMHNPs (many of our g raduates are offered positions with a starting salary of > $100,000/year). Career pathways are articulated through the students' clinical training experiences which total 1024 hours for DNP students and 540 hours for certificate students. Over the past two years, we have increased our marketing and recruitment to nurses in rural New Mexico counties since those healthcare providers tend to stay in their hometown/region after graduation. The School of Nursing integrates concepts in interdisciplinary/interprofessional collaboration throughout the curriculum and students have the opportunity to participate in an interprofessional immersion training experience with medical residents, and graduate students from social work, counselling psychology, pharmacology and other health disciplines. All DNP students complete a year -long scholarly project that involves the application of research to improve health system quality and/or population health outcomes. The PMHNP program attracts a diverse array of students from ac ross the State of New Mexico. This program is offered through a distance education/online delivery format which allows students from rural regions to remain within their home communities while they pursue their graduate degree. This program also addresses the NMSU LEADS 2025 Strategic Goal 3: Amplify Extension and Outreach. The School of Nursing has a long history of outreach to regional and statewide clinical partners and governmental health and social service agencies for the purpose of establis hing high quality clinical training sites for our undergraduate and graduate students. In 2019 , the PMHNP program established a formal partnership with NMSU Cooperative Extension Service through its 3 - year federal training grant from HRSA. PMHNP faculty are providing education of substance use disorder services and referral for treatment to extension agents throughout the state and PMHNP students are conducting drug prevention and mental health promotion projects and clinical training experiences with 4 -H programs throughout the state. This program also addresses the NMSU LEADS 2025 Strategic Goal 4: Building a Robust University System . Cultivating faculty and staff excellence through the Mental Health Nurse Practitioner RPSP program is essential for maintaining our graduation and licensing exam pass rates, which in turn allow students to contribute to the severe mental health provider workforce shortage in New Mexico. This program supports faculty and staff development in teaching, advising, curriculu m/program evaluation, leadership as well as teaching - and practice -based research/scholarship. Students are directly impacted when faculty and staff professional development leads to improved teaching/learning, better program support, and improved preparat ion for the PMHNP certification exam.

Students are also trained to deliver telemental health services, which is a key solution for delivering mental health services to residents in rural communities. RPSP funding provides critical support to students from rural and medically underserved communities in New Mexico. Mental Health funds have supported nursing faculty salaries and professional development, student support services, graduate student stipends, as well as equipment and software to im prove the quality and efficiency of delivering nursing education. The School of Nursing is requesting an increase in funding to support 1) enrollment growth and 2) salary stipends designed to reduce the risk of losing nurse practitioner faculty due to high market- based salaries in clinical practice arenas. Graduating mental health providers with prescriptive authority during a pandemic is especially important, as rates and severity of mental and behavioral health problems, including substance use , has risen since March 2020. 4.

IMPACT OF EDUCATORS RISING 2019 -2020 43 Active High School Chapters 600+ registered high school students 300+ students at 2020 State Conference 400+ total attended 2020 State Conference 29 Teacher Leaders trained 5 College Chapters: NMSU, ENMU, NMHU, DACC and Luna Community College New trainings planned for continued Teacher Leader support Education Pathways Programs in NM 2015: 6 2020: 43 Why Educators Rising? New Mexico currently has a need for teachers, especially bilingual teachers, SPED teachers and teachers in rural areas. The enrollment in Educator Preparation P rograms throughout NM has been decreasing for over 10 years. In an effort to reverse this enrollment trend and to support high s chool students who have a desire to pursue education as a career, The Alliance established the Educators Rising NM State office in 2015. Educators Rising serves over 600 students enrolled in 43 active high school chapters across New Mexico plus five College chapters . The Alliance has hosted five successful state student leadership conferences and supported student travel to the 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 national conferences. The funds will be used to continue staffing an Educators Rising State Office as it continues to grow. We will establish a regional support system for t eachers and students throughout the state of New Mexico. http://educatorsrisingnm.nmsu.edu GOAL 1: Increase the Teacher Pipeline in New Mexico Map of Educators Rising Districts Binder Page: Page 351 of 810 Goal 2: Increase partnerships to support Teacher Recruitment in New Mexico Alliance Partners: Outreach and Research Educators Rising Schools 2020 State & National Partners Education and STEM Outreach External Funding FY20 Alamogordo High School Atrisco Heritage Academy High School Aztec High School Bernalillo High School Bloomfield High School Career Prep High School Carlsbad High School Centennial High School Chaparral High School Clovis High School Clovis High School Freshman Academy Crownpoint High School Del Norte High School Deming High School Eldorado High School Farmington High School Floyd High School Gadsden High School Gallup Central High School Gallup High School Grants High School Hatch Valley High School Hobbs High School Las Montanas High School Logan Middle/High School Lovington High School Manzano High School Mayfield High School Melrose High School Newcomb High School Onate High School Piedra Vista High School Portales High School Raton High School REC 9 Rio Rancho High School Sandia High School Santa Fe High School Santa Teresa High School Taos High School Thoreau High School Tohatchi High School V.

Number of years the project has received General Fund support ( Disregard if new program): 14 2. Project Description / Executive Summary : The Alliance for the Advancement of Teaching and Learning focuses on two major initiatives: Educators Rising and the Southwest Outreach Academic Research (SOAR) Evaluation and Policy Center. Educators Rising, established in 2015, is a \"Grow Your Own\" teac her pipeline program that supports high school students interested in education careers. The program is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, the New Mexico Activities Association, and the NMPED as a Career Technical Student Organization (CTSO). There are currently 43 active high school chapters and 5 college chapters with over 600 Educators Rising students throughout New Mexico. Educators Rising coordinates an annual state conference and support for students to attend the annual national Educator s Rising conference. Educators Rising also provides curriculum support and professional learning opportunities for Teacher Leaders throughout the state. Binder Page: Page 353 of 8102. Project Description / Executive Summary : The SOAR Lab (now called the SOAR Evaluation and Policy Center as of December 2019), established i n 2016, employs staff, undergraduate, and graduate research assistants who work with NMSU Outreach programs to close the outreach -research gap. Students get hands -on experience with data collection, analysis and reporting by working with programs like the STEM Outreach Center, Mathematically Connected Communities and sponsored projects across the u niversity . In addition, these students collect the data for the annua l New Mexico Educator Vacancy Report which provides a picture of the need for education professionals in the state. 3. Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) The Alliance is asking for continued support for the rapid expansion of Educators Rising. New chapters need consistent and frequent support and training to help them establish their program, and existing active chapters need the continued program and curriculum support to best serve their students. We are asking for a small am ount of funds to support the SOAR Director, as SOAR has the goal of being self-sustaining as soon as possible. Our status as a Service Center also means that if we do not cover our own expenses (e.g. salaries for Director, staff, and graduate students), it does not go into our rate calculation and makes it falsely seem as though our expenses are low, meaning our rate will be too low. It is important that SOAR funds pay for as much of our expenses as possible without reliance on other funding support, or at least, as little as possible until we can fully cover all of our expenses. The FY22 RPSP request represents: (1) Salary (plus fringe) for the full -time director of Educators Rising NM state office ; (2) 40% salary (plus fringe) for Educators Rising progra m coordinator; (3) 20% salary (plus fringe) for director of SOAR. 4. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): MISSION The mission of the Alliance for the Advancement of Teaching and Learning is to contribute to the academic success of children and youth in New Mexico by supporting a statewide organization for future teachers known as Educators Rising and providing researc h support for K -12 STEM outreach programs through the Southwest Outreach Academic Research (SOAR) Center. VISION The vision of the Alliance is to serve as a catalyst in supporting educational initiatives in New Mexico, specifically those that focus on inc reasing the number of qualified teachers and raising the quality of STEM Outreach programs. Educators Rising has 43 active high school chapters: Atrisco Heritage Academy High School, Aztec High School, Bernalillo High School, Carlsbad High School, Centennial High School, Chaparral High School, Clovis High School , Clovis High School Freshman Academy, Del Norte High School, Deming High School (bilingual chapter), Eldorado High School, Farmington High School, Floyd High School, Gadsden High School, Gallup Ce ntral High School, Gallup High School, Grants High School, Hatch Valley High School (bilingual chapter), Hobbs High School, Laguna- Acoma High School, Las Cruces High School, Las Monta\u00f1as Charter High School, Logan Middle/High School, Los Lunas High School, Lovington High School, Manzano High School, Mayfield High School, Newcomb High School, Onate High School, Piedra Vista High School, Portales High School, Rio Rancho High School, Roswell Early College High School, Roswell High School, Sandia High School, Santa Fe High School, Santa Teresa High School, Taos High School, Thoreau High School, Tohatchi High School, V. Sue Cleveland High School, Volcano Vista High School, West Mesa High School Binder Page: Page 354 of 8104. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): In terms of demographics, about 80 percent of registered students are female, about half are Hispanic, a quarter of them are white, and the rest are other ethnicities, including almost 100 students who are American Indian or who identify as more than one race. In terms of populations served, the SOAR Center partnered wi th several organizations at NMSU and across the state that reach thousands of faculty, students, teachers, and service providers in several diverse districts. This includes our immediate Dona Ana County but also reach districts as far as Taos, Farmington, and Silver City. Many of our evaluations are for projects that focus on underserved students in particular, including K -12 and higher education students who need additional supports to progress through school, obtain a degree, or gain employment. 5. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) GOALS 1: 1. To create a pipeline of new teachers in New Mexico by serving as the state office for Educators Rising NM. 2. To increase partnerships with existing NMSU STEM Outreach Programs, school districts, community agencies Regional Education Cooperatives, State agencies, and National agencies to support teacher recruitment, research and STEM Education in New Mexico. 3: To increase the research capacity of the College of Education through the Southwest Outreach Academic Research (SOAR) Center.

G4: To increase the amount and quality of outreach provided by The Alliance. O1: Link resources, strengthen relationships and create new partnerships. 6. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and cha llenges for the current FY. For SOAR, we had a very busy and excellent 2019 -2020 Year: 1) In December 2019, we became a University recognized internal service center with an established hourly rate and index. This helps streamline our billing, makes it easier to pay for Dr. Boren's salary and other staff and student salaries, and establishes us as more independent when we serve on grant evaluations. 2) We published the 2019 Annual NM Educator Vacancy Report. 3) Four undergraduate interns gained valuable research experience as interns. Binder Page: Page 355 of 8106. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and cha llenges for the current FY. 4) We hired one full time Senior Project Specialist to su pport SOAR projects, the first full time SOAR employee who is not the Director (as Dr. Trujillo was). 5) We are serving as evaluators or research advisors on 14 active projects totaling about $75,000 in funds during 2019 - 2020, and for the first time, we received referrals and had repeat clients this year! We invest these funds to support our staff infrastructure, including the Director's salary, full time staff salary, and graduate students 6) We also received a lot of news coverage about the Vacancy Repo rt, and two articles in the Las Cruces Bulletin about our work with a local behavioral health provider on a grant they have. 7) We are increasing our client base, including the number of external organizations we work with and the departments at NMSU who we partner with on grants. Educators Rising had an excellent 2019- 20 year as well: 1) In September 2019 we established bilingual Educators Rising high school chapters led by Teacher Leaders with a bilingual endorsement, and using a 50/50 dual language model t o teach their Teacher Academy class. 2) We also created several bilingual competitions at our 2020 state conference, not only for the bilingual chapters but for any bilingual EdRising student to compete in. The bilingual competitions were our largest events a t the conference. 3) The 2020 state conference in March was a huge success with nearly 450 attendees from throughout the state including administrators, students, teacher leaders, parents, community members, NMPED representatives, and EPP representatives. We also received additional conference sponsorship from Dual Language Education NM ($2000). 4) Throughout the year we have been working with representatives from a NMHED bilingual education grant as well as Dual Language Education NM to provide bilingual resources, professional learning opportunities and support for our bilingual chapters and their curriculum. 5) In December 2019 we were awarded a $22,000 grant from the LANL Foundation to create new chapters in their region, and support existing chapters in their re gion. These grants are used to help support the Educators Rising growth and the increasingly well attended conference. 6) In May 2020 we applied for a $6,000 grant from the Robert Palmer fund to serve our bilingual chapter in Luna County. 7) While our chapter numbers and student membership numbers increased, we were unable to obtain an accurate account due to the national Educators Rising organization changing their membership system. Many of our Teacher Leaders had difficulty with registering for this required new process and while we were in constant contact with the national organization, they were unable to align our account with theirs. They will be implementing another new system July 2020 that should alleviate these issues in FY21. 7. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? The Alliance contributes to the New Mexico workforce needs by supporting the Teacher pipeline and \"Grow Your Own\" models across the state a s more districts turn to this model to address their own teacher shortages. The number of students registered as Educators Rising members and the number of new chapters and Teacher Leaders who are trained each year indicates the increasing interest in the Career Tech Education pathway through the Educators Rising program. It remains critical that students have a quality experience in Educators Rising so they have a deeper understanding of what it means to be a teacher in New Mexico. It is detrimental to the extant teacher shortage if students enter the profession not knowing what is involved and then lea ve the profession within a year or less. The number of teacher vacancies did decrease last year (per the Vacancy Reports ), and we will continue to examine tr ends in teacher needs and vacancies each year. Our new bilingual chapters also help teachers and ELL students alike in supporting effective dual language models. Educators Rising has hosted five statewide conferences since 2016, with attendance increasing yearly. We continue to work with districts that serve primarily Native American students and schools, who are increasingly effected by the teacher shortage in the state , to support these and underrepresented student needs to help them succeed in school wit h well trained teachers . For SOAR, our evaluations impact thousands of students, educators, social service providers, community members, and other stakeholders across the state. Our evaluations have shown the impact of different professional development and educator Binder Page: Page 356 of 8107. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? support programs on their pedagogy and attitudes that are important for student outcomes, improvements in student math engagement and achievement, interest in career and technical education, and research skills in several different discipline s. In terms of STEM education in particular, SOAR supports individuals in New Mexico who are involved in the different areas under this umbrella. This includes supporting the evaluation efforts for programs such as Math Snacks, MC squared, ECHO for Educati on, and grants in the Colleges of Engineering, ACES, and Arts and Sciences. The SOAR Center provides valuable information for leadership and stakeholders about impacts of these programs/grants, what needs to improve for them to achieve their goals, and key information they need to consider for scaling up their efforts. Consequently, many teachers and students are impacted by this research and evaluation, as they are the key populations that these projects hope to serve not only within their specific locale , but the goal of expanding services and disseminating resources is a constant for these groups. 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? The Alliance staff does seek outside funding to support the efforts of Educators Rising and the SOAR Center initiatives. The following funding sources were provided in FY20: Educators Rising - NMPED Perkins Grant: $35,000 for FY20 with renewal in progress at the time of this submission report . - Cooperative Education Services: $25,000 for FY20 with renewal in progress at the time of this submission report. - Los Alamos National Labs Foundation: $22,000 (December 2019- December 2020) - Dual Language Education NM: $2000 Educators Rising NM state con ference sponsorship - These grants are used to support the growth of Educators Rising, including supporting new chapters and the increasingly well attended state conference. For FY20, SOAR was active on 14 different evaluations with funders that included the National Science Foundation, the New Mexico Public Education Department, the National Institutes of Health, the Bridge of Southern New Mexico, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Kellogg Foundation, the Paso del Norte Foundation, and the United St ates Department of Agriculture, bringing in over $75 ,000 for our evaluation components of these grants alone. We have several continuing projects next year and are on 7 pending grants as of this report date. These funds are invested back into SOAR to suppo rt the Director's salary, our full time staff's salary, and graduate students who help with our many projects. 9. Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) Educators Rising: Over 600 high school student members Hosted Educators Rising state conference in March 2020, with over 400 attendees, including students, teacher leaders, NMPED representatives, EPP representatives, parents and community members.

Does the RPSP align with the NMSU Mission? (Check all that apply) Research Public Service Teaching 2. Explain below how the program aligns with the mission. Answer is limited to the box below. The Alliance for Teaching and Learning Advancement is essentially two organizations: the Southwest Outreach Academic Research (SOAR) Evaluation and Policy Center and Educators Rising. In terms of Research, SOAR actively contributes to the advancement of research at NMSU by writing well reviewed evaluation plans for grants to strengthen their proposals and then serving on projects to provide robus t evaluation plans if these are funded. We are active on several grants across campus and with non -profits across the state and are able to offer excellent evaluations at a reasonable cost due to our recognition as a University Internal Service Center. Man y of these grants focus on working with teachers to improve their abilities to impact student outcomes in high need areas and among underrepresented populations and in rural areas. We also give graduate and undergraduate students hands on experience with r esearch that they cannot learn in a classroom. For Public Service, our Educators Rising office helps to build a robust career tech education program for high school students interested in education to understand what this career involves and to continue t o foster their passion for the profession. Community service is an integral part of each chapters scope of work throughout the year and we have integrated a service -learning project where Educators Rising chapters develop, plan, carry out, and evaluate se rvice projects to improve the quality of life in their local communities . In terms of Teaching, Educators Rising works to help address the teacher shortage in the state by creating a pipeline from high school to Educator Preparation Programs. Educators Rising is collaborating with representatives from a NMHED bilingual education grant to create more bilingual educators and options for bilingual students. In FY20 we added a bilingual Educators Rising option for chapters that have a Bilingual Endorsed Teacher Leader, or teachers who want to complete their bilingual endorsement to create a bilingual chapter. With much success, our 2020 state conference held the first bilingual competitions for not only bilingual chapters to participate, but for any bilingual EdRising student to compete. Our curriculum development efforts with Educators Rising Teacher Leaders are focused on culturally and linguistically responsive practice, as well as online activities and opportunities given COVID -19. Binder Page: Page 359 of 8103. Short Program Summary: Provide a short description of what the program does, i.e. Mission, scope, how the program benefits the state, or what challenge/need it addresses. The program summary is limited to the box below. It will be used as a description in submissions to the board of Regents, NMSU administration, the Higher Education Department or the Governor's Office. The Southwest Outreach Academic Research (SOAR) Evaluation & Policy Center serve as evaluators for grants, internal research, and external organizations in education, healthcare, and the social sciences. We are currently serving as the evaluator for grants and projects in several departments at NMSU that are funded through several organizations, including the National Institutes of Healt h, the National Science Foundation, the United States Department of Agriculture, and others. We also partner with external organizations to serve as evaluators on their grants . We provide robust evaluations and ensure that our partners have the data they need to determine the impact of these programs and identify areas that are not working and need improvement. Educators Rising is a \"grow your own\" program that cultivates highly skilled educators by guiding young people in becoming accomplished teachers, from middle school/high school through college graduation and into the profession. Educators Rising collegiate chapters are student organizations at colleges and universities, and often work with the high school chapters in recruiting new teacher candidate s. We currently have 43 active Educators Rising high school chapters throughout New Mexico, with several new schools beginning to develop chapters. Educators Rising collegiate chapters are at five higher education institutions in New Mexico, with additional chapters in development. Educators Rising hosts an annual state conference for aspiring teachers to compete in authentic performance -based events to demonstrate their knowledge, skills, and leadership in education. 4.

Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performanc e measure form) IRD has 2 key objectives that arise out of the statutory mandate: -To assist in the education and training of NM Native American students through career discovery camps, professional development opportunities, and internships in agricultural and environmental sciences, engineering, and business for the purpose of ensuring the successful development and management of tribal resources. -To work with tribes in developing agricultural, natural and business resources, and associated technical and managerial expertise as a way to promote their economic self -sufficiency. 6. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. Some of the major accomplishments of the IRD program: Note: When this document refers to \"students,\" it means Native American students from New Mexico. -Provided students opportunities and support for internships, professional development, and jobs in collaboration with UNM, Roanhorse Consulting, and NMSU. - Promoted and offered scholarship opportunities for students to participate in the WERC Environmental Design Contest organized by the College of Engineering at NMSU. Participants propose solutions to engineering tasks posed by industry partners and government agencies. - Promoted and offered scholarships for New Mexico Tech's Summer STE2M Experience, an opportunity for high school students to experience what it means to be a college student and learn about a specific science or engineering discipline. - Provided financial relief, in partnership with the Native American STEM program, for 30 qualified students at UNM who w ere experiencing financial difficulties due to being furloughed or loss of employment due to COVID -19. - Connected Navajo Agriculture Products Industry with New Mexico Technical University so they can explore opportunities for collaboration related to th e scholars program that NAPI currently had only with NMSU. - Participated in career fairs at Pueblo of Isleta, UNM, and NMSU where more than 100 students attended each event to learn about career opportunities at New Mexico higher education institutions, and internships and jobs with NM companies and agencies. IRD was registered to attend a career fair at Taos High school but had to cancel due to dangerous road conditions brought about by a winter storm. - Hosted the 2020 Dream Keepers - Online summer camp where 13 high school students participated in daily career -discovery workshops for 6 weeks, in the fields of agriculture, environmental sciences, engineering, and business. The camp was carried out with the help of 5 Native American student counselors from NMSU, UNM, and NTU; and in collaboration with 25+ representatives from NM institutions and organizations like NMTech, Santa Fe Community College, Los Lunas Public Schools, Pueblos of Isleta and Jemez, USGS Water Science Center, and IAIA Contemporary Mus eum. -Co-sponsored 30 Native American youth from New Mexico to participate in the Senior Leadership Retreat which focused on career development by providing 19 different career exploration workshops, and tours for participants. - Helped the Bureau of Land Management with the planning of the 2019 Native American Symposium, featuring inter -tribal cultural presentations and panels. - Connected SFCC with a hemp investor and ag specialist, whose family is Native American, to explore partnerships for the development of hemp opportunities in New Mexico tribal communities. Binder Page: Page 370 of 8106. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. - Sponsored the participation of 14 tribal representatives in professional conferences related to the management of natural resources and best organic agricultural practices. The IRD program faced two challenges brought about by the departure of the program specialist IRD had and the pandemic. The first one, required the newly appointed director to carve out time to find a new program specialist for IRD. The seco nd one, placed limitations that forced a pause in the development of relationships and partnerships with NM schools and tribal communities, and shifted resources that were initially destined for offering or supporting in- person programs like camps and internships. 7. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? The statewide impact of the IRD program is that it extends the opportunity to pre -collegiate students from a spec ific minority group in New Mexico, namely, Native Americans, to explore higher education opportunities in critical areas for their communities, and once in school it supports them by providing professional development opportunities in the form of internshi ps and participation in relevant conferences and national or international experiences. The educational efforts and economic development endeavors of the IRD are aligned with the Governor's priorities because, even prior to her current public service job, Mrs. Lujan Grisham advocated and worked to ascertain the respect, welfare, and progress of Indigenous groups in New Mexico. As Governor, she has clearly demonstrated of her commitment to the Indigenous peoples of New Mexico and her interest in working in a collaborative and respectful manner. Another statewide impact of the IRD relates to the community and economic development work it does with tribes so the economic growth and public welfare of New Mexico will be promoted. The prog ram promotes self -directed and self - sustaining economic development and management of resources by Indigenous peoples on tribal lands in New Mexico. Governor Lujan -Grisham's administration, like the IRD, emphasizes and acts on the importance she places on economic development for New Mexico, and recognizes and respects the sovereignty of tribal entities. 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? Yes, IRD seeks private and corpo rate donations, as well as grant funding. However for FY2019 IRD did not apply for funds for itself but partnered with others to help leverage funds that could have larger impact, for example: - with the in -kind contributions of IRD, NMSU was able to secure $750,000 from the US Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration to offer the Innovation and Commercialization for Regional Energy Workforce initiative which focuses on accelerating clean energy technology and developing a statewide clea n energy workforce. Because of this grant, IRD is able to offer free- of-charge energy efficient assessment for tribal businesses; partner with collaborators across the state who are part of the initiative and are interested in expanding internships and career exploration opportunities to Native American students. A second example of how IRD helped leveraged funds, was by offering in -kind support to an NSF S -STEM proposal at NMSU entitled \"The Natural Resource Career Track (NRCT) Program: A Partnership to R ecruit, Retrain and Engage Students in Natural Resource Sciences.\" IRD offered to use its network to help connect Native American students from the NRCT program with internship and career opportunities through the state of New Mexico, federal government and tribal communities; and share information related to the NRCT opportunity to high school and community college contacts to increase the visibility of this program. Another example of how IRD multiplied its funds was through the partnerships with Studio G at Arrowhead Center to support entrepreneurial initiatives from Native American students at New Mexico universities and community colleges. Together, we were able to offer job opportunities to Native American students at 8 higher education institutions in the State so they can Binder Page: Page 371 of 8108. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? promote the opportunities offered by the American Indian Business Enterprise center and at the same time, promote what IRD can offer in terms of internship and research opportunities. 9. Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) Other accomplishments not captured under numeral 6, however related to the administration of the program, or important partnerships are: Administrative -Defined the role and responsibilities of the tribal advisory committee and began taking steps to work towards its expansion. -Hired (November 2019) a full -time Program Specialist who has ten years of experience working in programs related to social concerns and higher education with substantial involvement in developing student leaders and coordinating i mmersion trips for students. Her educational background is in social work, she holds a Bachelor's and Master's in this field. Partnerships that are beginning to bear fruit - Established a partnership with the NMSU College of Engineering as part of the I nnovation and Commercialization for a Regional Energy Workforce to help extend the benefits of the program to Native American communities in New Mexico. The goal of the project is to promote job creation through education, entrepreneurship, innovation and workforce development. - Established a partnership with the New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) to help increase the participation of Native American students in this program. AMP is a statewide partnership of universities and colleges wi th a goal to increase the number of underrepresented minority students who successfully complete their B.S. degrees in the STEM disciplines. -Established a partnership with Studio G at Arrowhead Center to combine efforts to support entrepreneurial initiat ives of Native American students at New Mexico universities and community colleges via the American Indian Business Enterprise (AIBE) center. The purpose of AIBE is to support entrepreneurship, innovation, business creation, jobs and the local entrepreneur ial ecosystems for Native American students in New Mexico. Continue to work to develop this partnership further - Explored collaboration opportunities with the Native American Budget and Policy Institute with regard to community assessments for job oppor tunities in tribal communities and to secure funding for an outreach person for IRD who could work exclusively with NM high and middle schools.

Number of years the project has received General Fund support ( Disregard if new program): 2 2. Project Description / Executive Summary : New Mexico's agricultural industry provides nearly $3 billion to the state's economy, second only to the gas and oil industries. Most of New Mexico's agricultural products, however, are shipped out of state for processing before returning to New Mexico as consumer -available products. Processors in other states are profiting from New Mexico's agricultural producers and the lack of extensive value- added industries in New Mexico agriculture. In order to build a vibrant and sustainable food and agricultural industry in New Mexico, state -of-the-art value -added industries must be developed. New Mexico State University, a Hispanic- serving, high -research -activity, land -grant university located 60 miles from the border between the United States and Mexico, is uniquely positioned and equipped to meet the pressing needs of value- added agricultural industries. The Center of Excellence in Sustainable Food and Agricultural Systems (CESFAS), established at NMSU in 2019, is a critical component in New Mexico's ability to build and sustain a viable food and agricultural system to feed the population and to grow the state's economy. Increasing the state's value -added processing industry, a key goal of CESFAS, is essential to this effort. Another goal of the Center is the development of sustainable food supply chains and the reduction/elimination of food deserts currently occurring in the state. With the accomplishments of its goals, CESFAS will be a vital asset to the state's recovery from the COVID -19 crisis. The CESFAS will sustain New Mexico's vibrant food and agricultural systems long into the future and will support the ACES four pillars of economic and community development: 1) food and fiber production and marketing, 2) water use and conservation, 3) family development and health of Mexicans, and 4) Environmental Stewardship. Current plans for CESFAS include the following work areas: 1) nutraceuticals and functional foods, 2) specialty markets for Binder Page: Page 385 of 8102. Project Description / Executive Summary : meat and produce 3) food safety, 4) food security, 5) food bioprocessing, 6) hemp industrialization, 7) value -added agribusiness and ag supply chain entrepreneurship, 8) food, agriculture and natural resource law and policy, 9) agricultural and culinary tourism, 10) sustainable water systems , 11) artificial intelligence/big data science in agriculture, 12) beneficial use of produced and brackish water, 13) soil health, 14) science and agricultural literacy, and 15) adapting to climate variability. 3. Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) The CESFAS was originally funded at $250,000 for FY21, but was sanded 4% to $2 40,000 during the Special Legislative Session in June 2020. The budget is being used primarily to hire faculty with expertise critical to the success of the center and administra tive support (17%) . The faculty positions are in the areas of microbial food safety, food bioprocessing and water for food systems. Each of these positions wi ll have responsibilities for research, Extension and teaching. We are also using some of the resou rces for start -up funds for graduate student support, travel, supplies, services and equipment. This will provide for the foundation of the Center of Excellence in Sustainable Food and Agricultural Systems. In addition, we are supporting a competitive seed grant opportunity for research and extension efforts related to CESFAS interest areas and are developing a Sustainable Steward Student Internship program . We hope to be able to fund the first intern in the summer of 2021. 4. Program Mission (include pop ulation served, other de mographic info): Although current food and agricultural systems are remarkably productive, they are not sustainable in the long -term . The goal of agricultural sustainability is to meet society's food, fuel, feed , and fiber needs in the present wi thout compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability is a complex idea with three key facets. Food and agricultural systems should be environmentally sound, economically viable , and socially responsible. Ultimately, through research, education, Extension, and outreach programs, the Center of Excellence in Sustainable Food and Agricultural Systems (CESFAS) will work to sustain human communities and the environments in which they live. CESFAS, established within the College of Agricultural, Consumer , and Environmental Sciences in collaboration with other NMSU colleges, is well -positioned to work across many disciplines with faculty, staff , and students on the main campus and at the Agricultural Experiment Stations and Cooperative Extension Offices located around the state. Beyond the campus community, it will collaborate with NGOs, growers, community members, state and federal agencies including USDA. The Center's work will be heavily focused on applied research, academic education and practical training, community outreach, and public service from K -20 educational institutions to international agencies. 5. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) 1. Develop transdisciplinary collaboration among university faculty with industry partners to identify and work on research and educational needs. 2. Conduct innovative research that supports value -added agriculture. 3. Provide practical, research - based e ducation to develop workforce -ready graduates with the training and skills needed to support value -added food and agricultural industries. 4. Become a hub for collecting and disseminating the most current information and training on livestock production, p lant production, food safety, food science and technology, and value -added entrepreneurship. 5. Foster communication between industry and education and disseminate information that consistently serves as a resource to the agricultural industry, the community and the K -20 educational system. Faculty hired under the umbrella of CESFAS will hold appointments in academic departments within NMSU. They will be expected to develop highly productive, interdisciplinary, collaborative programs within research, Extens ion, and/or teaching in accordance with their position descriptions. They will establish an externally funded program through submission of competitive grant proposals, publish in top- tier journals, and mentor undergraduate and graduate students and post -docs. These performance metrics, among others, will be mea sured and accounted for in their academic departments which is the norm at NMSU. 6. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. FY20 was the first year of this project. The most significant accomplishment to date is developing the structure of the Center and a strategic plan for the Center of Excellence in Sustainable Food and Agricultural Systems that aligns with the goals and objectives of NMSU's strategic plan, LEADS 2025. Other major accomplishments include: Binder Page: Page 386 of 8106. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. 1. Hired administrative support for the Center. We have hired a Director and Associate Director who are paid stipends for this work (their base salaries are supported through the Agricultural Experiment Station, Cooperative Extension Service and the university's Instruction & General Fund) . CESFAS reso urces are also paying 25% of a program manager, who has responsibilities in reporting, impact writing , and communica tions . These administrative costs equaled 17% of the total CESFAS Budget in FY20. 2. Created a website for the Center which provides information useful to both internal partners and external stakeholders. 3. Created awareness of the Center across the NMSU Campus and with agency and industry partners. 4. Developed a faculty resource expertise g uide - Engaged current NMSU faculty in the Center's efforts through the development of a contributing faculty expertise guide. We believe that our existing faculty are the foundation upon which we will accomplish the mission of the Center and their participation is vital to our success. We hoped to engage 50 existing faculty in our first year and are excited to report that 113 faculty in 4 NMSU College's and 2 partner agencies (USGS and USDA) have signed on as Contributing Faculty. These existing faculty wi ll work with CESFAS facult y to develop transdisciplinary research and extension teams to address complex global challenges. 5. Created 3 new faculty posit ions at NMSU in Microbial Food Safety , Food Bioprocessing , and Water for Food S ystems. These three posit ions fill critical gaps in NMSU's expertise in efforts related to sustainable food systems. These three positions were created by leveraging additional resources from the NM Cooperative Extension Service, the NM Agricultural Experiment Station, NMSU's Inst ruction & General Fund, and industry. By leveraging these additional resources, we are able to expand the resources of the Center beyond the 1.5 FTE envisioned by the NM Legislature. We have completed the hiring process for the Microbial Food Safety and Fo od Bioprocessing faculty members . The Water for Food Systems position is advertised. Additionally, an AES faculty line was redirected to hemp research and extension responsibilities. These faculty will develop externally funded research and extension progr ams, teach graduate -level courses, publish high -quality research and Extension publications, mentor undergraduate and graduate students, train post -doctoral scientists, and will help NMSU to meet strategic goals related to NMSU LEADS 2025 and return NMSU t o an R1 research institution. The only obstacle faced this year was the occurrence of COVID -19 and the need to move to an online/telework environment. Although we are able to do this and have adopted the use of available meeting technologies, online inte ractions are not as effective as face -to-face communications, especially when it comes to partnership building. We are continuing to develop new strategies to engage our stakeholders and to develop our advisory committee in the face of this pandemic. 7. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? The Center of Excellence in Sustainable Food and Agricultural Systems was developed through the Governor's special initiative for Centers of Excellence across New Mexico. This Center will develop, expand , and promote sustainability in New Mexico's agricult ural industries through cutting edge research, innovation, technology, student education, and workforce readiness training. The i ndirect impact of the Center will be the development and expansion of value -added food and agricultural businesses, the creation of jobs related to these business es, and increased economic and community development for New Mexico. 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? The faculty positions in deve lopment are being funded partially with this legislative funding and all have additional support from one or more of the following sources: Agricultural Experiment Station, Cooperative Extension Service, NMSU Instruction & General Funds, College of Engineering, the Office of the Vice President for Research , and industry. We have developed a proposal for private funding and will continue to seek partnerships with public and private entities in support of the work of CESFAS. Binder Page: Page 387 of 8109.

The purpose of the FY 22 funding is toexpand diagnostic services for individuals referred for an Autism Diagnosis. The NMSU -ADC will address the need for a timely diagnosis for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in southern New Mexico. Wait times for families seeking ASD evaluation are among some of the longest in the nation and range from 9 to 24 months. Given the rise in the incidence of ASD and long wait times to access diagnostic services, one center is not sufficient to meet the needs of the state. The NMSU ADC will reduce the current backlog at the UNM -CDD and increase diagnostic capacity in the southern region of the state by providing quality and timely evaluations. Children in the area suspected of having ASD can now be evaluated closer to their home and readily access services that will help improve their quality of life and achieve meaningful outcomes. Statement of Need 1.Need to decrease diagnosis wait time. At present, New Mexico has only one state funded autism di agnostic center, the Autism Spectrum Evaluation Clinic (ASEC). The ASEC, located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has been unable to meet the increasing demand for its services. Currently the re is a two-y ear wait time for initial diagnosis. 2.Need to ma ximize intervention outcomes through early intervention. Evidence-b ased intervention research clearly re veals t hat the greatest positive intervention outcomes for i ndividuals with autism occur when intervention is offered as early as possible. A diagnosis of autism is now possible as early as six months of age. Positive treatment o utcomes could be drastically reduced due to postponed diagnosis. 3.Need to offer more local services. Decentralizing autism diagnostic services for individuals in southern New Mexico wi ll offer more efficient patient/practitioner/intervention specialist collaboration and therefore better patient care. 4.Need to offer relief to ASEC . Dona Ana i s the second largest county in New Me xico in terms of population density . Providing autism diagnostic services in Dona Ana County will potentially relieve the two year wait list for ASEC and therefore se rve the state's needs in autism diagnosis as a whole.2021 Purpose INCIDENCE OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER 2000 1 in 150 2016 1 in 54 Incidence of ASD is rapidly increasing -the need for early intervention by qualified practitioners, is critically needed in New Mexico. https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.htm Binder Page: Page 397 of 810RPSP Name HereBackground ASD is a neurodevelopment disorder that impacts a person's communication, behavior and ability to function, and ranges from a total inability to form meaningful communication and social interactions to functional but limited social communication and interaction.

Project Description / Executive Summary : According to the CDC, in the United States, the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been on the rise and is currently estimated at 1 in 54 or 1.85% of children. Across the nation, access to diagnostic services has not kept up with the rapid increase of ASD. Less than half of the children with ASD receive an evaluation by three years of age due to long wait times to access diagnostic services and few individuals with expertise in ass essment of ASD. Delays in diagnostic evaluation impact a family's ability to access ASD intervention services. Access to these services is crucial, as early intervention results in improved outcomes. In New Mexico, current wait times for families seeki ng an ASD evaluation are among some of the longest in the nation and range from nine to 24 months. Until now, the state has operated with only one diagnostic center located at UNM's Center for Development and Disability (CDD) in Albuquerque. Given the rise in the incidence of ASD and long wait times to access diagnostic services, one center is not sufficient to meet the needs of the state. The new Autism Diagnostic Center (ADC) at NMSU was created to reduce the current backlog at the UNM CDD and increase diagnostic capacity in the southern part of the state by providing quality and timely evaluations. Children in the area Binder Page: Page 399 of 8102. Project Description / Executive Summary : suspected of having ASD can now be evaluated closer to their home and readily access services that will help improve their quality of life and achieve meaningful outcomes. Placing the ADC within New Mexico State University, College of Education, and Department of Communic ation Disorders also offers an added benefit of training graduate student clinicians in assessment of individuals with ASD. We hope to train four students per year. 3.

Shape the Future. Actual: $821,600 FY 22 Request: $821,600 Change: $0 The problem : Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), trauma, and social adversity lead to costly challenges including mental and medical health problems, substance misuse, low educational achievement, and lack of job readiness. The solution : Research shows that access to vital services can prevent and mitigate ACEs and social adversity. We work with communities to ensure that 100% of residents have access to 10 vital surviving and thriving services Where we work : we are currently working in the counties of Dona Ana, Socorro, Rio Arriba, San Miguel, Otero, Valencia, and Taos Pueblo . How we work: We use the frameworks of Continuous Quality Improvement, Collective Impact, and Adaptive Leadership. The work in a county begins with an assessment of access to 10 vital services in a community using our 100% Community survey. Local action teams ensure access to ten sectors through a process of Assessment, planning, action and evaluation. Who we work with: We work at the county level with local stakeholders including city, county, and school staff, community members, private businesses, non- profits, and foundations. . Our institute's far -reaching goal is ensuring that our children, students and families are safe and thriving. The Anna, Age Eight Institute was funded by the New Mexico state legislature in 2019. Our institute's far-reaching goal is ensuring that our children, students and families are safe and thriving. To achieve this we're using a data -driven process focused on building the capacity of local government, non- governmental agencies and the business sector to provide the surviving and thriving services that community members need to strengthen health, safety and resilience . MANY CRISES, ONE SOLUTION The institute utilizes the 100% Community initiative to prevent childhood trauma. The 100% Community initiative is also a useful strategy to address access to services during a pandemic and economic disruption. We have worked to support local leaders across the state in providing the services coined \"services for surviving and thriving.\" Our goals and activities are guided by data and research, and are urgently needed across New Mexico as we recover from a pandemic, assess our systems of care, and face a complex economic downturn with high rates of business closures and joblessness. THE PLAN New Mexico has, with the 100% Community initiative, a data- driven, cross -sector and technology -empowered plan of action that provides each county with a way to navigate the colliding crisis of COVID- 19 and economic downturn. Instead of guesswork or relying on old ways of doing things, we have provided a path forward to ensure all residents survive and thrive. We have the framework to guide all cities and counties through a collaborative and data -driven process. We have the expertise in technology to enhance all our vital services to increase quality and reach.Calendar July 2020- Readiness training for San Miguel County and Taos Pueblo August 2020 - Socorro C ounty Readiness training August 2020- San Migue l 100% Community Survey2021 Binder Page: Page 411 of 810 This page left intentionally blank Binder Page: Page 412 of 810NEW MEXICO HIGHER EDUCATION DEPARTMENT Research & Public Service Projects (RPSP) FY 2022 Institution: NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY Name/Title of Project Anna, Age Eight Institute Indicate Type (X): New Continuing Expansion Final (Ending/Closing) FY22 Funding Request ($XXX,XXX) : 821,600 If Previously Funded, Amount that was awarded in FY21 ($XXX,XXX): 821,600 Type of Project (X for Type) Research Public Service Academic Athletics Clinical Economic Development Other (Explain Below) Please explain if other is marked: Click or tap here to enter text. 1. Number of years the project has received General Fund support ( Disregard if new program): 2 2. Project Description / Executive Summary : The Anna Age Eight Institute (AAEI) was funded from the general fund in FY 20 and 21. The AAEI was established for the data - driven prevention of childhood trauma and maltreatment by ensuring that 100% of residents have access to 10 vital surviving and thriving services. When COVID- 19 became a pandemic in March 2020, the in stitute supported crisis response and preparedness by utilizing the established model while moving toward virtual meetings and trainings. 3. Budget Narrative (Overview only - Relates to Budget Form) The requested budget is to continue the work of the AAEI in fiscal year 2022 4. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): The problem: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), trauma, and social adversity lead to costly challenges including mental and medical health problems, substance misuse, low educational achievement, and lack of job readiness. The solution: Research shows that access to vital services can prevent and mitigate ACEs and social adversity. We work with communities to ensure that 100% of residents have access to 10 vital surviving and thriving services Binder Page: Page 413 of 8104. Program Mission (include population served, other de mographic info): Where we work: we are currently working in the counties of Dona Ana, Socorro, Rio Arriba, San Miguel, Otero, Valencia, and Taos Pueblo. How we work: We use the frameworks of Continuous Quality Improvement, Collective Impact, and Adaptive Leadership. The work in a county begins with an assessment of access to 10 vital services in a community u sing our 100% Community survey. Local action teams ensure access to ten sectors through a process of Assessment, planning, action and evaluation. Who we work with: We work at the county level with local stakeholders including city, county, and school sta ff, community members, private businesses, non -profits, and foundations. 5. Key Project Objectives (Overview only - relates to performance measure form) Our key objectives are to support counties in implementing the 100% Community framework. This is measured through number of counties and communities completing the 100% Survey, and the number of communities trained in the 100% Community model. Our short term outcomes include more collaboration across services, increased use of data to identify gaps, and greater public understanding of Adverse Childhood Experiences and social adversity. Our long term outcomes include greater access to the ten vital services, and lower rates of child maltreatment and neglect, as well as overall improvement in child and family wellbeing. 6. For EXISTING PROJECTS - Describe major accomplishments and/or obstacles encountered in the previous fiscal year. For NEW PROJECTS - Identify the top objectives and challenges for the current FY. The original fiscal sponsor lacked the capacity to support the statewide mission of the AAEI or any of the programming which severely curtailed our ability to implement our vision. Despite this, we have accomplished many of our goals including the following (see item 9 for a more detailed description of accomplishments): Completed the 100% Community su rvey in order to assess families' access to ten vital services in the counties of: Dona Ana, Rio Arriba, Socorro, and Taos Pueblo. Supported a summit in La s Cruces to share survey results with over 300 attendees. Started the 100% Community ini tiative in San Miguel county, supported creation of 10 action teams focused on each of the ten vital services, supported the creation of a directory of services. Built relationships with statewide partners in Otero, Santa Fe, Valencia, Bernalillo, and several other counties. Built the institute website ( www.annaageeight.org ) with a directory of every elected official in New Me xico Our major objectives for FY 21 and FY 22 include training pilot counties in the continuous quality improvement process so that they can utilize the survey results and other information collected in the assessment process to fill gaps in access to servic es in local communities. We also hope to complete the 100% community survey in three additional counties - likely San Miguel, Taos, and Santa Fe. Binder Page: Page 414 of 810 7. Describe the project impact (State wide impact, does it address the Governor's initiatives, and/or what are the student outcomes? The Anna, Age Eight Institute was funded by the New Mexico state legislature in 2019. Our institute's far -reaching goal is ensuring that our children, students and families are safe and thriving. To achieve this we're using a data - driven process focused on building the capacity of local government, non -governmental agencies and the business sector to provide the surviving and thriving services that community members need to strengthen health, safety and resilience. MANY CRISES, ONE SOLUTION The strategy, \"the 100% Community initiative,\" to end childhood trauma is also a useful strategy to address access to services during a pandemic and economic disruption. We have worked to support local leaders across the state in providing th e services coined \"services for surviving': medical care, behavioral health care, stable housing, secure food and transport to services. We have also worked to guide local agency leadership as they provide the \"services for thriving;\" parent supports, earl y childhood learning, community schools, youth mentors and job training. Our goals and activities are guided by data and research, and are urgently needed across New Mexico as we recover from a pandemic, assess our systems of care, and face a complex econ omic downturn with high rates of business closures and joblessness. THE PLAN New Mexico is unique in that it has, with the 100% Community initiative, a data- driven, cross -sector plan of action that provides each county with a way to navigate the colliding crisis of COVID -19 and economic downturn. Instead of guesswork or relying on old ways of doing things, we have provided a path forward to increase access to the services residents need to survive and thrive, including a way to train people for jobs that will emerge in the new \"post crisis\" economy. We have the framework to guide all cities and counties through a collaborative and data- driven process. We have the expertise in technology to enhance all our vital services to increase quality and reach. 8. Does the project receive awards, private donations or Federal grants? Have you sought out funding from other sources? In 2019, the institute a pplied for the MacArthur foundation 100 and Change grant, made it to the 3rd out of 5 rounds. We are currently in the process of applying for CDC grant for statewide ACES prevention . 9. Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) DONA ANA COUNTY: Conducted the 100% Community survey in Dona Ana County, implemented by the Dona Ana Resilience Leaders that was organized by Las Cruces City Councilmember Kasandra Gandara. These survey results, showing where gaps in ten services exist and why, is guiding ten action teams focused on addressing gaps. The results were shared at a community summit with over 300 attendees. The Lt Governor provided the welcome for this event. SOCORRO COUNTY: The 100% Community survey results will be available soon, as the 100% Community initiative, led by Dr Sharon Sessions from New Mexico Tech and long-time community activist JC Trujillo, mobilize to begin analyzing data and identify gaps. Binder Page: Page 415 of 8109. Accomplishment/ Highlights (bullet form) RIO ARRIBA COUNTY: 100% Community survey results reveal gaps in all ten vital services and are a call to action for the county's leadership. We are in dialogue with the county's medical providers and education stakeholders to discuss a plan to move forward in all ten sectors. SAN MIGUEL COUNTY: We are working with Matt Probst, PA -C, medical director for El Centro Family Health, twenty clinics in Northern New Mexico, to support his 100% Community initiative, wit h ten action teams and collaboration with Highlands University, the Sheriff Chris Lopez, local government leaders and economic development team. We also designed their Online Resource Guide to Ten Vital Services. TAOS PUEBLO: We supported their surveying o f family members to assess access to ten vital services and have worked with their teams as they sponsored their 100% Community book club, and are now getting ready to pilot our 100% Community course with the initiative. The Taos team has also hosted a meeting with Taos County leadership, where we presented to initiate dialogue about forming a Taos County 100% Community initiative. SANTA FE COUNTY: We have met with city and county leadership, including Santa Fe Mayor Alan Webber and Santa Fe Community College president Dr. Becky Rowley, to begin the process of surveying residents on their access to ten vital services. OTERO COUNTY: We were approached by Alamogordo School's superintendent and assistant superintendent before the pandemic hit, and have been co llaborating with them on a county plan to ensure vital services. Their vision has led to the 100% Community book. VALENCIA COUNTY: We supported their Health Council in sponsoring a 100% County book club with Council members and stakeholders to discuss the strategies in the book and how they might be customized to meet their unique needs. We continue to support their county plan for addressing colliding crises. FIVE COUNTY -EASTERN NEW MEXICO REGION: We are working with Dr Melissa Hardin at Eastern New Mexico University to develop a regional plan to implement a five -county 100% Community Initiative in the counties of Roosevelt, Curry, Chaves, Quay and Lea. This would promote resource -sharing with solutions designed specifically for rural New Mexico. SEVEN COUN TY-NORTHERN NEW MEXICO REGION: We are in dialogue with stakeholders serving seven northern New Mexico counties to discuss the capacity to design a seven -county 100% Community initiative that strengthens the counties of Rio Arriba, San Miguel, Mora, Colfax, Taos, and Harding. This would strengthen individual counties while creating a collaborative system of care to promote coordination. REACHING ACROSS THE STATE The activities documented above represent collaboration with more than half of New Mexico's count ies where we are in dialogue and development. We are in more counties discussing with lawmakers and stakeholders how we might begin to collaborate, including the counties of Grant, Bernalillo , San Juan and Sandoval.

Does the RPSP align with the NMSU Mission? (Check all that apply) Research Public Service Teaching 2. Explain below how the program aligns with the mission. Answer is limited to the box below. The Anna Age Eight Institute (AAEI) aligns with the mission of NMSU's mission to serve the diverse needs of the state through comprehensive programs of education, research, extension and outreach, and public service. The institute's far- reaching goal is ensuring that our children, students and families are safe and thriving. To achieve this, we're using a data- driven process focused on building the capacity of loc al government, non -governmental agencies, and the business sector to provide the surviving and thriving services that community members need to strengthen health, safety and resilience. The five survival services are: medical care, behavioral health care, food, housing, and transportation. The five thriving services are community schools, parent supports, early learning programs, youth mentor ship, and job training services . The Institute provides support to leaders in the county who form ten action teams , one for each survival and thriving service, to utilize a process of Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) to assess gaps in services, plan how to address those gaps, implement the plan (action), and evaluate progress. We bring to county's leaders and sta keholders a process of learning, mobilizing and innovating, all with the support of state -of-the-art technology. Locally, the Institute's 100% Community initiative helps guide collaborative efforts using the critical steps of assessing, planning, action an d evaluation to ensure accessibility to the ten services shown to empower all families. We are part of New Mexico's higher education system, with a mandate from our state's leaders, to serve all New Mexicans by strengthening local systems of health, safety , learning and economic development. The 100% Community initiative is collaborative and works in alignment with local programs that impact health, safety, learning and economic development. Our short term outcomes include more collaboration across services , increased use of data to identify gaps, and greater public understanding of Adverse Childhood Experiences and social adversity. Our long term outcomes include greater access to the ten vital services, and lower rates of child maltreatment and neglect, as well as overall improvement in child and family wellbeing. Binder Page: Page 419 of 8103. Short Program Summary: Provide a short description of what the program does, i.e. Mission, scope, how the program benefits the state, or what challenge/need it addresses. The program summary is limited to the box below. It will be used as a description in submissions to the board of Regents, NMSU administration, the Higher Education Department or the Governor's Office. Our hypothesis guiding the Anna Age Eight Institute's (AAEI) 100% Community initiative is informed by a wealth of research focused on a wide variety of topics including the public health model for addressing crisis, emergency readiness, the social determinants of health, health equity, health and education disparities and historical trauma. Our hypothesis is that if we ensure that families have access to the five survival services and the five thriving services, we will increase family resiliency and reduce incidences of Adverse Childhood Experiences and childhood trauma. The AAEI's model aligns with several of the Governor's priorities including food security, early childhood, and racial justice. The Governor and Lt. Governor have attended and spoke at multiple AAEI events, promoting and supporting the work of the Institute. 4.

Dear New Mexico Department of Agriculture, Office of Director, Please support the set up of rules to implement Senate Bill 57. As someone on the front line of animal rescue I cannot emphasize enough how expensive and difficult it is to try to stem thetide of unwanted pets in this state. There are multiple layers to the problem but one of the mostconcerning is the lack of affordable spay/neuter in a state where many, many, residents are notwealthy or even 'comfortably off'. We pay our taxes and this is something so constructive, helpful, and humane that the NMDA could do for New Mexicans and for animals. Thank you.

Dear New Mexico Department of Agriculture, Office of Director, Let's face it: the SB 57 spay & neuter program is the EASIEST and LEAST EXPENSIVE way to seriously reduce the number of homeless animals and shelter pets WITHOUT BEINGBURDENSOME on taxpayers who are, frankly, not interested in animal welfare. Those of uswith pets shoulder the expense and are happy to do so,. Please alter/change NMDA rules to effectively put SB 57 into operation. Thank you.

I have also been a part of the pet overpopulation and suffering solution for most of the thirty plus years I've lived in New Mexico, as a pet rescuer and fosterer. I now sit on the board of aspay and neuter nonprofit. We are especially struggling to provide services this year, as wewere unable to secure our usual grants (circumstances beyond of our control), and now theeconomy is in disarray. I am hoping for the Department to be able to move quickly on this funding. Little furry lives count on it!

I have personally lobbied for this bill in theCapitol for the past three years. Living in the Bernalillo-Placitas- Algodones area I have personally seen the effects of not having sufficient levels of spaying/neutering with too many abandoned animals. My wife and Ihave personally donated to both animal rescues as well as vet offices to help pay for the costof spaying and neutering to help alleviate this problem.

NMAC, Sections 7, 9, 10, 26 and 31, effective 1/01/2021 Date: Monday, July 20, 2020 9:27:24 AM WARNING: This email originated external to the NMSU email system. Do not click on links or open attachments unless you are sure the content is safe. Good Morning, I am writing today to submit questions and comments regarding the amendment to 21.18.3. NMAC, Sections 7, 9, 10, 26 and 31, effective 1/01/2021. Please see notes/comments in red. 21.18.3.31 SPAY AND NEUTER PROGRAM FEE: A. Additional Fees: In addition to the commercial feed registration fee, an additional annual fee shall be collectedon each pet food registered with the department. This fee shall be implemented as follows: Pet treats are registered under the commercial feed registration and application, and are approved\"feed ingredients\" however, they are not \"pet food\". Will pet treat manufacturers beincluded as \"pet food manufacturers\"? And be required to pay the Spay and Neuter ProgramFee? If so I would recommend changing the language of the amendment to include all manufacturers of pet and speciality pet products. Proposed new amendment language \" In addition to the commercial feed registration fee, an additional annual fee shall be collected oneach pet food product registered with the department.\" or even one further... \"...canine and feline products...\" This would clarify for specialty pet foods as well, such as; parrots, gerbils,hamsters and all other small \"specialty pets\". As non canine and feline product manufacturesshould not have to pay for the spaying and neutering of canines and felines. (1) Beginning January 1, 2021, fifty dollars ($50.00) (2) Beginning January 1, 2022, seventy-five dollars ($75.00) (3) Beginning January 1, 2023, one hundred dollars ($100.00) Why is there a graduated scale of fees increasing from $50-100 over the next three years? Iwould suggest making the fee whatever it is going to be, and do that in year 1. A lot of petproduct manufacturers utilize a firm to complete their product registrations, and have an annual budget set for this. Having a graduated scale requires a change in that budget each year,through 2023. B, Exemptions: (1) A pet food manufacturer shall be exempt of the Spay and Neuter Program fees upon submission of a notarized affidavit attesting that tax-year annual gross revenue from thedistribution of pet food is no more than three million dollars. The Spay and Neuter Programfee exemption affidavit shall be submitted to the department on a form furnished by thedepartment. Is this exemption three million dollars in distributed food within the state of New Mexico? Or is this three million dollars over all as a company? If this is three million overallas a company, I would suggest changing that to food distributed within your state andlowering that amount, to an appropriate state amount (suggested $250k). (2) A pet food manufacturer shall be exempt of the Spay and Neuter Program fees uponsubmission of a notarized affidavit attesting that a specific product meets the definition ofprescription diet. The Spay and Neuter Program fee exemption affidavit shall be submitted tothe department on a form furnished by the department. Why are companies exempt from paying a fee based on \"prescription diet\"? These are the companies that can afford to pay this Binder Page: Page 799 of 810 Binder Page: Page 799 of 810fee for spaying and neutering and should be paying those fees. Additionally with the current lawsuits around the false and misleading marketing of prescriptions diets, and those diets not requiring a prescription by the FDA and only by the manufacturer. As well as those diets notmeeting the FDA language of a drug or requirement of a Rx and licensed pharmacist. Mysuggestions would be to strike this exemption all together. C. Distribution, ninety-six percent of this additional fee collected shall be deposited with the state treasurer to credit the statewide spay and neuter subaccount of the animal care andfacility fund. Four percent of this additional fee collected shall be distributed to the departmentto administer the Spay and Neuter fee dispensation.

Occasionally, a s warranted by the circumstances, t he chancellor may also implement ore revise administrative rules provisionally, pending such r eview. Additionally, non- substantive revisions are made periodically without formal approvals to reformat, update or correct, as part of regular ARP maintenance (e.g. updates to job titles or office names, correcting typographical errors or hyperlinks, adding cross references). This report is submitted pursuant to ARP 1.10 (Part 6 G. 3.) to summarize the revisions made to the ARP during the period April 21, 2020 through September 8, 2020. 1.ARP 16.21 - No Trespass Directive - Restricted Campus Access was revised provisionally by the chancellor on May 8, 2020, as recommended by the police chief , to enhance campus safety and conserve law enforcement resources during declared disasters and other emergencies.
