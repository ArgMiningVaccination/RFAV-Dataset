Centella Asiatica, commonly known as gotu kola leaves, are often used in skincare, but only a few know that they can also be processed into herbal medicine for various diseases, including cancer. Cancer is a highly feared disease that frequently results in death. Researchers worldwide are conducting various studies and efforts to find the right medicine and treatment for this leading cause of death globally. Among them are the 'Acetaminofun' team from Universitas Pelita Harapan (UPH) Pharmacy Study Program. They processed gotu kola leaves as a raw material for herbal medicine to treat cancer. The team that consists of Jocelyn Telaumbanua, Jessica Laurencia, and Imelda Angie won first place in the Pharmaceutical Industry Case Study (PICS) category at the Pharmanova 2023 national competition organized by the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) on January 21, 2023 \"Gotu kola leaves are effective in fighting free radicals due to their high antioxidant content. Gotu kola leaf extract can also slow down the growth rate of cancer cells and even kill them, making it a promising alternative herbal medicine for cancer treatment,\" Jocelyn explained. The UPH Pharmacy students hoped that their research would benefit society and the medical world in dealing with cancer. They also mentioned the valuable experience they gained throughout the whole process of the competition, including research, material deepening, and presentation preparation. They gained new insights related to cancer and are optimistic about the potential of gotu kola leaves as an alternative herbal medicine for cancer treatment. Imelda, on behalf of her team, credited their success to hard work, the support of their lecturers, and the pharmaceutical knowledge they gained at UPH.
