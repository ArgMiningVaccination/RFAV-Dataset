It can be used by a person whenever they feel weak, or on a daily basis to strengthen the immune system. It is also beneficial as a daily practice for those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, trauma or other serious health problems. The hands are used to send energy to three dif - ferent organs of the immune system: the Peyer's patches located in the walls of the intestines, the spleen and the thymus gland. Hold each position for 2 -3 minutes breathing deeply. Imagine light or healing energy filling these parts bringing health and wellbeing to the entire system. This practice is adapted from the work of Sue Hovland and used with permission. Position 4 Leave the left hand on the thymus and move the right hand to the spleen, located on the left side of the abdomen just at the edge of the rib cage. (The spleen gets a double boost.)Position 2 Leave the right hand in place over the Peyer's patches and move the left hand to the spleen, located on the left side of the abdomen just at the edge of the rib cage. Position 3 Leave the right hand over the Peyer's patches and move the left hand to the thymus, lo - cated just above the heart and be - low the throat in the center of the chest.Position 1 Place the left hand on the lower abdo - men just below the navel. The right hand rests on the abdomen just above the left hand, over the navel. This en - ergizes the Peyer's patches found in the intestinal wall. Capacitar: Trauma Healing 38PAIN DRAIN The Pain Drain can be done on oneself or on another person to relieve physical and emotional pain or tension in the body. If the exercise is done on another person, it is important to protect oneself with a shield of light or energy (or some other appropriate image of protection), so that the tension of the other person is not picked up. If you feel their pain or tension entering your body, use an image of a garden hose to drain the tension down into the earth. Do this practices for several minutes. Drain the Pain from the Body Place the left hand on or above the area that hurts and hold the right hand downward and away from the body. Imagine that you can siphon the pain or tension from the sore spot with your left hand and this can drain out your right hand into the earth. A pumping action with the right hand will speed up the process. Hold this position for several minutes or until any sensation or movement of energy flow stops. Fill the Body with Light and Energy Reverse the hands, placing the right hand on or above the area that was painful and hold up the left hand, palm upward, to bring in healing energy from the Universal Energy Field. Fill the area that was painful with light and warmth. Remember that any energy drained off is neutral, does not have negative or positive quality and quickly dissipates into the Universal Energy Field. Source: Hover-Kramer, D.
