Meth creates additional dopamine in the brain which causes euphoria and ultimately a crash when it leaves the system.

This leads to [addiction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4354220/) (1), according to the U.S National Library of Medicine. The meth withdrawal process can be daunting, causing people to feel depressed or even lack emotions. Meth addiction comes with the consequence of withdrawal when attempting to quit \u2014 whether it is cold turkey or even gradually. If you or someone you know is suffering from meth addiction, it's important to understand the proper way to [detox](https://quest2recovery.com/los-angeles/treatment/detox/), as well as the meth withdrawal symptoms to expect. In this article, we will discuss meth withdrawal symptoms, meth withdrawal home remedies, and meth addiction treatment options to help you make the best decision for your situation. Meth Withdrawal Can Be Difficult, But Doing It Right Is Important When an individual is coming down from meth, their body begins to crave the drug still. This is what causes the withdrawal symptoms. However, going through this detoxification process is good and necessary. It is the only way to truly be free of the [substance addiction](https://quest2recovery.com/los-angeles/treatment/) that has plagued you or your loved one. If a person is going through opiate withdrawal, they should be very conscious of any medications they are taking, as well as partake in proper hydration and consume healthy foods to ease the symptoms as much as possible. What to Expect from Meth Withdrawal Treatment Coming down from meth is a very unpleasant process. The symptoms make it very difficult to quit. A person going through withdrawal should seek professional help for addiction treatment at a detox center before they get worse. Some of the meth withdrawal symptoms are mental, while others are physical. These may include: - Paranoia - Agitation - Anxiety - Muscle aches - Depression - Fatigue - Suicidal thoughts - Itchy eyes - Loss of appetite The timeline of these recovery symptoms can be as little as a few days, or up to a few weeks. Those who have been using meth for longer typically experience more prolonged symptoms. Attempting to use meth withdrawal home remedies is common, although it comes with the risk of using the drug and relapsing again. Natural Detox Remedies People may experience intense cravings to consume meth and other drug and alcohol substances when detoxing. This cold turkey meth detox period often leads them to search for home remedies. However, it is important to know that home remedies for meth withdrawal do not have evidence of working effectively for recovery. This means they are not the best option, as you don't have proper substance abuse treatment for the severe withdrawal symptoms you experience. The reality is that most relapses occur when someone is attempting to detox at home without any supervision or treatment. The symptoms \u2014 such as anxiety, muscle aches, and more \u2014 can become so overbearing that the person uses meth again in order to cope. This is especially true if they do not have a strong support system from friends or family around them. For most individuals, addiction recovery should be done in a detox center that works to rehab the patient over time, instead of alone in their own homes. That being said, there are certain natural remedies that those who experience crystal meth withdrawal often try. This includes: Workout Work out as often as possible. Detoxing from meth makes you feel less energetic, even though the additional \"energy\" you had when taking the drug was false. Exercise gets your blood flowing which naturally increases energy. And it also releases endorphins, which make you feel happier. Acupuncture Acupuncture is an alternative medical practice. It involves the use of tiny needles, placed around the body in order to manipulate or release energy (\"chi\") from \"pressure points\" around the body. While some have reported increased mood or relaxation after this procedure, it is not supported by medical science for drug recovery. It is most likely attributed to the placebo effect, which can be achieved via other methods. Yoga Yoga is beneficial because it is a form of light exercise. This allows your blood flow to get going, without putting too much strain on yourself during the detox. It also involves stretching, which has beneficial effects on joints, muscles, and mood. However, Yoga is not accepted as an official treatment for drug abuse, so it should not be depended on for opioid withdrawal. Vitamins When someone has been abusing drug and alcohol substances like crystal meth, they often neglect their health. Instead of eating or cooking foods rich with vitamins and minerals, they may opt for lower quality meals in order to remain focused on their \"high.\" Thus, supplementing with vitamins during meth detox can help replenish some of your body's much-needed nutritional balance. Keep Hydrated Water is an important part of remaining healthy under any circumstances. However, due to the intense detox process of crystal meth, staying hydrated is even more crucial. Aim to drink one liter of water each day at a minimum to avoid relapse. Long Hot Baths to Calm Nerves Being nervous or anxious is a common symptom of withdrawal from substance abuse. Warm baths can relax the body and mind. This helps put your attention on positive thoughts instead of aches, pains, and anxious thoughts \u2014 helping with the mental recovery aspect. Do Something Fun When you drop a bad habit, one of the best things to do is to replace it with a new habit. Get out and do something enjoyable like going for a walk, to the movies, or taking the dogs out. You can also find enjoyable activities at home such as Netflix, video games, family board games, and simple activities.
