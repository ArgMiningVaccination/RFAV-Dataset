Chinese herbal medicine offers a safe and natural treatment for building your immune health. Taking herbs is similar to getting a mini acupuncture treatment every day. We work to boost your body so that if you come into contact with the virus, your immune system has the best chance to do its job against a respiratory illness. COVID-19 + Herbs A collaboration between Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used in China to fight COVID-19 for the past few months. All patients with confirmed infections were to take Chinese Herbal Medicine. The results from the front lines in Wuhan have been very promising. For us as TCM Doctors, this has given us a huge amount of preliminary studies to research the past few weeks. Though we do not prevent, treat or cure COVID-19, this has given us strong knowledge to understand what immune-building herbs are working best in this situation. A Customized Process We are grateful that there are different Chinese herbal formulas that can build up your immune health. Every person that is evaluated will likely receive a different formula, even if the conditions are the same. Since each body is different, the reason for a disorder's existence will be unique as well. Disclaimer: Blue Ova Health makes no claim that we can cure, treat or prevent COVID-19. There is currently no known cure for the virus. All recommendations given are focused on building immune health. All herbs are not to be used in place of Western medicine rather they are to be integrated into a comprehensive plan utilizing both Western and Chinese medicine to ensure optimal outcomes. For readers who may have an infection from COVID-19, contact and consult your primary Western physician, go to the hospital or the CDC immediately. "}
