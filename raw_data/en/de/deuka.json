Today, Chi-nese medicine is no more a living tradition than is the society of impe-rial China, with whose rise and descent it was inextricably linked. Nonetheless, in China and abroad at the beginning of the twenty-rst century, numerous activities continue to upgrade, utilize, or reprocess the residues of Chinese medicine. It would be na\u00efve to assume that Chinese medicine can survive as an artifact in a social and cultural environment based upon entirely different worldviews than those that rst stimulated its rise two millennia ago. Its historical chapter closed, historians are now challenged to evaluate Chinese medicine as a cul-tural product documented in countless textual and material sources. As there is only one other medical tradition whose unbroken devel-opment can be traced from antiquity to the present\u2014European medi-cine, now known as Western medicine\u2014it is only natural that an evaluation of the one requires a comparison with the other. This is all the more true because one has expired while the other continues on with increasing strength. The Chinese and European medical traditions originally developed at separate ends of the Eurasian continent, and their early histories largely unfolded in isolation. Still, the beginnings of Chinese medi-cine are closely connected to the beginnings of medicine in the Eastern Mediterranean, although not necessarily in a tangible sense. While it is tempting to trace this or that development in Han dynasty China to something similar separated by only three centuries in time in an-cient Greece, there is no hard evidence allowing us to view the rise of xixii Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition medicine in Greek culture as a precondition for the somewhat later restructuring of health care in China. Nevertheless, the two events are closely associated because of an apparent similarity in the ancient Greek and Chinese approaches to nature, and in Greek and Chinese ideas about the origin of illness and the best way to prevent or cure it. Unfortunately, little has been written that can help us to clarify the many differences and parallels between early Greek and Chinese medicine. 1 Much more scrutiny would be required to penetrate the surface and advance to the core of the underlying ideologies. The ap-proach chosen here is to leave the health care function of Greek and Chinese medicine alone and focus on a deeper layer, that is, on their cultural signicances. In fact, the therapeutic function of Greek and Chinese medicine may simply be a veil behind which the real message of medicine is to be discovered. I have focused elsewhere on the origins of basic notions of the \"healthy\" and \"sick\" organism in early Greek and Chinese medicine. Apparently, at no time were such notions legitimated by the expressive power of the organism itself. 2Historical evidence suggests that the im- age of the body has its model outside of the body. Neither the theo-ries proposed and tested on human patients in Greek and Chinese antiquity, nor modern notions of, for example, immunology, have their origins in clinical observations or scientic experiments. The origin of such basic notions rather lies in their plausibility. They are plausible, and thus acceptable to many, because they are projections onto the human organism of experiences or ideals of order and crisis in humankind's environment. That is to say, in the history of both Greek/European and Chinese medicine, basic theories of health and illness were metaphors originating in human fears of disorder and chaos as well as from visions of peace and stability. While these theories are mostly understood as attempts at understanding and successfully pre-venting or healing human disease, their deeper rationale is to be seen in their expression of human concern over order and disorder in gen-eral. Presumably, it is difcult to simultaneously harbor in one's sub-consciousness antagonistic understandings of order and crisis. This reality seems to explain why over two millennia of medical history, every fundamental change in the interpretation of health and illness was preceded by fundamental changes in the understanding of order and disorder in the social and natural environment. One may con-clude that without such changes in experience and vision, the dynam-ics of medical history would have lacked their motivating force. Later, I will probe the ideologies underlying Greek and Chinese Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition xiii medicine from a related and yet somewhat different angle. An observa- tion such as \"the image of the body has its model outside of the body\" equally applies to both Greek and Chinese medicine. At rst glance this may come as a surprise, given the apparent differences between cognitive dynamics in Greek/European and Chinese civilizations, but medicine, we need to realize, reflects the deeper strata of human con-sciousness. These may be universal strata. Medicine is a cultural reac-tion by humankind to what is perceived as an existential threat: the limitation of daily routines by illness, suffering, and the risk of early death. Medicine's therapeutic function is to guarantee that such im-pediments are prevented, or cured if they cannot not be prevented, and that death does not come early but at a time when it is considered inevitable. Inevitability is the key concept here, and who is to decide which events in human existence are inevitable? Do we have the right to de-cide when we are to die, and how well, in what fashion, and how long we may live? 3 With this we approach another meaning of medicine; that is, its quest for existential self-determination. Through medicine, humankind attempts to control the quality and duration of earthly existence. Medicine becomes a cultural tool to shift power over human existence from the numinous to humanity itself. This is certainly true for ancient Greek and European medicine; the question we wish to ask and discuss here is whether this is also true for Chinese medicine. A brief glance at ancient Greece may recall the sociopolitical mes- sage underlying the beginnings of European medicine. A quote from Homer's Iliad offers a hint: \"That god was Apollo, son of Zeus and Leto. Angry with Agamemnon, he cast plague down onto the troops\u2014deadly infectious evil.\" 4 This is what intelligent people were convinced of in early times: Apollo was angry with Agamemnon who had mis-treated Achilles, a darling of the gods. Eventually, Apollo sent a plague and countless people on earth died. In the Homeric view, an individ- ual had no control over the quality and length of his or her existence. Homer's epic leaves us no doubt: people may acquire technical skills to heal a wound received on the battle eld or elsewhere, for exam-ple, but they have no control over disease and the moment of death. These were decided by the gods, and the gods decided independently of humans. Some individuals may have traced longevity to their own merits, but one could never be sure what fate had in store. To those who died from the plague cast down by Apollo it did not really matter whether they were good or bad. Their end appeared based on pure arbitrariness.xiv Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition Not much later, beginning in the sixth century b.c., views had changed. Possibly stimulated by the confrontation with oriental reali- ties of despotism in Ionia, some intellectuals in ancient Greece had developed a new worldview with an outlook that promised emanci-pation from the whims of despots, monarchs, oligarchs, tyrants\u2014and gods. The key to these changes lay in the introduction of formal laws, nomoi, to structure social existence, and, most important, per- mit a self-organization of the citizens of political structures. The names of Dracon and Solon are remembered because they symbolize the trend toward early European democracy. The citizens of the early poleis sought to shed despotism, to establish a society free from the rule and arbitrariness of tyrants and monarchs. This freedom was achieved through the introduction of social laws. With their introduction, the citizens of the Greek polis had acquired a standard to measure behav-ior and to solve social crises by themselves, without patriarchal inter-vention by aristocrats or other powerful gures. The subsequent sequence of events appears to have been that the concept of laws for social stability was expanded by some philosophers to embrace what was considered an eternal stability\u2014that is, an eternal regularity of processes\u2014in the entire universe. Inevitably, in the same manner that the introduction of laws in society resulted in the deposition of the aristocrats, the belief in natural laws as the basis of all dynamics in nature resulted in the loss of the gods' power. Common to both social and natural laws is an assertion that events are predictable. Where events are predictable because they are ruled by law, life can be planned\u2014independent of the whims and arbitrariness of secular or celestial authoritarian powers, be they monarchs or gods. Aeschylus and Euripides are witnesses to the rise of this new worldview. Their dramas are still worth our attention because they were the rst to raise the question of an individual's responsibility for the course of his or her own life. How much of what we experience and must bear in life is fate set by the gods? To what extent do people contribute to their own circumstances through their own behavior? This is, as Nietzsche observed, the rise of the tragedy. Tragedy signals a shift from heteronomy to autonomy. Aeschylus and Euripides asked their audiences to consider situations where the gods had forced hu-mans to knowingly commit a wrong, and the humans faced retribu-tion as if they had themselves been responsible. These plays marked a transition. Eventually, the nomoi were seen not only as helpful in achieving stability and predictability in society, but also as useful in Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition xv explaining the stability of the universe and in predicting future events with certainty. A growing segment of the polis intellectual elite ac-cepted a threefold credo\u2014yes, a credo that implicitly began \"I believe,\" because there was no way to prove it: First, natural laws exist independent of time, space, and persons\u2014 be they humans or numinous. Second, humanity is able to recognize these laws.Third, once they have been recognized, these natural laws sufce to understand, explain, and eventually manipulate at will all natural dynamics. This credo left and still leaves no room for gods or, later, one God. This credo offered increasing autonomy to humankind once we had set out to nd and use the natural laws. It was the onset of an irre-solvable contradiction between science and religion, and hence it is no wonder that Socrates paid for his acceptance of this credo with his life. He and his Ionian philosophical masters placed themselves at the beginning of an entirely new cognitive culture. Socrates was perfectly aware that he and his fellows had to start from zero. The dictum ascribed to him, \"I know that I know nothing,\" may be reread, iso-lated from its original context, as an exhortation to realize the three-fold credo identied above. His opponents were equally aware that this was the signal for a slow but inevitable weakening of an old ide-ology that was not prepared to grant humankind self-determination, but was forced from then on to defend existential heteronomy. Greek medicine, in its essence, involved the application of a quest for existential autonomy to the human experience of illness and the risk of early death. Greek medicine was the logical extension of the three-fold credo to humanity's desire to determine the length and the quality of our own existence. This, then, is the cultural message of Greek and European medicine. It emerged out of the beginnings of a democratic mentality in Europe. In the polis society , citizens strove to control their political and everyday life independent of the whims and arbitrariness of the aristocrats. In a broader realm it was gradually understood that, for example, thunder and lightning, harvests and pests origi-nated from conditions ruled by natural laws, not by gods. As in soci-ety as a whole, those who abide with the laws will survive in nature. Laws may, it appears, put pressure on people to behave in a certain way. However, laws are required to limit or even end autocratic arbi-xvi Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition trariness. As early an author as Cicero considered it meaningful to emphasize the liberating potential of the concept of laws when he stated: \"We are servants of the laws so that we can be free.\" 5 The belief in laws, whether social or natural, contradicted a belief in an autocratic order. Each man could decide for himself, and was therefore responsible for, the course of his life. Medicine emerged as an additional cultural tool to grant freedom to each and every indi-vidual. Epilepsy was not a sacred disease cast upon humanity by the gods, as earlier generations of experts had insisted. Its etiology rested, as the anonymous author of a Hippocratic text of the same title noted, in pathological dynamics independent of numinous intervention. Med-icine promises to free us from such heteronomous intervention; medi-cine offers instead secular explanations of all physiological, pathological, and etiological dynamics. Once humankind, presumably after an ex-tended period of research, has laid open these dynamics, we will be able to decide the length and the quality of our lives for ourselves. Naturally, for the entire two and a half millennia that have since passed, and despite impressive results of biomedical research, such as computer tomography and antibiotics, cloning and prenatal diagno-sis, the guardians of human heteronomy have not been silenced in their opposition to the advances of European medicine. Each major turning point has evoked their squeals. Their opposition to vaccina-tion in the nineteenth century and stem cell research more recently are but two examples where humans striving to exploit these scien-tic avenues are denied existential self-determination on the grounds of a morality that is nothing but a thinly disguised acceptance of the rule of numinous powers beyond the reach of humans. To con-clude this brief view on the origins and nature of medicine in ancient Greece and Europe, the antagonism between democratic ideals of individual autonomy and authoritarian principles underlying heter-onomy that has characterized European political history for two and a half thousand years nds its parallel in the contradiction between medicine and religion. It is now worthwhile to turn our eyes to China, and ask ourselves whether Chinese medicine, besides its task of cur-ing pain, lesions, and functional losses, was also built on a cultural message. As we began our recollection of the Greek/European history of health care with a quote from the Iliad (ca. seventh or sixth century b.c.), the Shu jing (Book of History ), presumably from the second half of the rst millennium b.c., may be an appropriate source to examine the earliest traces of Chinese health care. An entry reads:Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition xvii The king has an illness . . voiced a prayer: so-and-so is afflicted with a severe nue-disease. If it is you, the three kings, who bear responsibility for your great son vis-\u00e0-vis heaven, then accept me, Dan, in his place.\" \"The king will not suffer harm. I, unworthy son, have been able to obtain a new mandate from the three kings.\" . . . The following morning the king was healed. 6 This is not the earliest evidence of existential heteronomy in ancient China. The oracle bones of the Shang dynasty preceding the Zhou era inform us of the dependency of the living on the goodwill of the dead. An elaborate communication system was installed to learn the origins of ancestral wrath and to initiate appropriate action to rees-tablish harmony between the two communities. The anecdote just quoted from the Book of History is remarkable insofar as it provides us with additional specics. While the oracle bones helped the living to address their individual ancestors\u2014that is, they acted in a family relationship\u2014the Book of History quote offers evidence of a differ- ent setting. Apparently, tian (heaven) was an institution that could be approached like a ruler and that was open to changing its will. While the severe nature of the king's disease at rst gave his court every reason to envisage his death, life was extended after Duke Zhou intervened and offered himself as a substitute. Life is fate (ming), or to use the Greek term: moira. On earth we may pray and beg, and if one is lucky, heaven will reconsider a fatal decision. Actually, Mengzi and other philosophers granted humanity a certain margin of self-determination and responsible action within the bounds of the more general and loosely knotted web-work of tian ming, the fate ruled by heaven. The ideal social being, the junzi, was admonished to cultivate himself and enhance responsible action to make full use of the options left by tian ming. This is by no means different from what people expe- rienced in the daily life of a feudal society. They were led to behave well, but in the end it was the arbitrariness and the whims of rulers who decided whether or not an individual could enjoy the full span of his or her life or not. Heteronomy was the fundamental social principle underlying the relationships of ruler and ruled on earth, and also of a supposed ruler in heaven and those ruled by him on earth. As the Mawangdui health care manuscripts, so admirably translated by Don Harper, show, in addition to ancestors and heaven, there was a third agency that claimed heteronomy over human life. 7 At some time during the Warring States period humans came to recognize the existence of spirits who were not their personal ancestors. Rather, a huge population of demons was now seen to exist. Their origins and xviii Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition family ties with the living, if they had any, remained unknown. Unlike the ancestors whose wrath appeared to be provoked by misbehavior of their descendants, the demons were universally malicious, and they were always prepared to harm any unprotected humans. From today's perspective we may interpret this everlasting threat as a projection of Warring States experiences on the relationship between the living and unseen spiritual forces. All morals appeared to have lost their binding force among human competitors for power, and the same was assumed to characterize the relationship between humankind and the world of the demons. Demonstration, and if necessary, execution of power, was required to deal with demons. They did not feel obliged to morality or laws, and they would not listen to appeals from their victims. If this scenario was not frightening enough, yet another possibly even more horrifying certainty arose. We can only surmise the extent of mutual distrust that the Warring States period sowed\u2014a state of mind that may have persisted for many centuries to come. Distrustmarked not only the relationship with strangers; distrust was also the dominant attitude even within families, in particular between genera-tions. This is the only possible explanation for a feeling of dependency on the ancestral spiritual world that developed at some time around the Han dynasty and was then transmitted to following generations. The image humans have of the spiritual world always has its model in the reality of the secular world. Hence when Chinese intellectuals came to believe in a dependency on the wrongdoings of their ances-tors up to the ninth generation, the model of such a notion must be sought in the relationships between human generations on earth. 8 This was different from the notion of ancestral wrath apparent in the oracle bones. In the new view, the living had no chance to escape the detrimental effects of their ancestors' bad deeds. No one was seen as a self-determined individual capable of designing the length and quality of his or her life on the basis of personal behavior, but as a link in a chain of generations. There was no way out of it. Deceasedhumans were confronted in the afterworld with the misdeeds they had committed during their life, and their descendants suffered from the allegations and punishments the sinners were exposed to in hell. Perhaps we may reinterpret the age-old Chinese emphasis on one's \"good name\" as a constant reminder of one's obligations beyond this life. The living may have felt compelled to live a morally impeccable life, but they themselves were not promised any benet from it. Theo-retically, if nine subsequent generations led an impeccable life, the Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition xix tenth generation would be spared the consequences of their ances- tors' wrongdoings. As such a positive development was rather hypo-thetical, endless suffering of all existing and future generations was to be expected. One can hardly imagine a higher degree of heteronomy than is expressed in this worldview. Humans were at their secular rulers' mercy, and they were at mercy of their ancestors, of heaven, of count-less demons, and of an otherworldly bureaucracy reacting to the for-mer wrongdoings of their clientele, now in hell. Daoism has been recognized by Michel Strickman as an ideology that attempted to break this dependency, at least partially. The approach chosen was one of power and struggle, together with a recognition of certain nat-ural phenomena that we might consider as tied to natural laws pos-sibly beyond the influence of numinous forces. Much research will be required to trace the development towards an increasing existential autonomy step by step over a formative period that may have lasted from the third century b.c. to the fourth century a.d. Within this long period all the elements emerged that formed Chinese health care until the end of the imperial era. As in Europe, one faction of the intellec-tual elite chose to neglect the numinous entirely; we shall return to their worldview later on. Daoists constituted the most prominent group among those of the intellectual elite who saw no reason to dis-continue their belief in the existence of innumerable types of demons, ghosts, spirits, and gods. In fact, Daoist writers and visionaries per-ceived a universe of numinous beings that paralleled in size and struc-ture the world of the living. Naturally, one might be tempted to say, both worlds were characterized by the same intensity of hierarchical relations, of the use of force, and of general distrust. The quest for harmonious social relations, for a morality guided by a doctrine of the mean, for humanness (ren), and appropriateness of one's behavior in relation to others (yi), as well as the strong emphasis placed on family bonding expressed in a concept such as xiao (lial piety), so promi- nently emphasized in Confucian writings, should tell us that all of this was lacking in the reality of Chinese social life. This lack, in turn, gave rise to a desperate longing to which the various social doctrines of ancient China each reacted in its own way. The path that the Daoists chose was certainly not homogeneous. Nevertheless, a few basic patterns may be discerned. The world of the dead was considered to be populated by forces that constitute hell and heaven. One of the strategies of early Daoism consisted of asso-ciating everything bad in human life, especially illness, with forces in xx Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition hell, and to enlist the help of a celestial bureaucracy to keep the evil of the underworld at bay. The living needed to be freed from the bur-dens placed on them by their ancestors and by the bureaucracy of the underworld intent on making entire lineages of up to nine genera-tions accountable for past wrongs. Daoism recognized all this and identied positive forces in a celestial bureaucracy that would be willing to help humans escape their plight. The question was how to stimulate the good numinous powers to help humans ght the ma-levolent numinous forces. Numerous apotropaic techniques were in-troduced to achieve this end. Basically, they all served to demonstrate power by creating alliances of the living with higher forces. Written amulets, incantations, and ritual movements were at the center of such strategies, reflecting a projection of interhuman power plays onto the world of the numinous. But there was more to it. By the end of the Zhou dynasty, Chinese observers had come to believe that cer-tain natural phenomena had a recurrent nature whose regularity lay beyond the reach of human or numinous power. In particular the so-called qicame to play a most decisive role. If humans and their celes- tial allies were able to act in accordance with specic constellations of climatic qi, they should be in a position to ward off any evil. It was a ght for existence all the time, but there was also a notion of a regu-larity beyond the secular and the numinous world that could be used by the knowledgeable to achieve their particular ends. One of the texts in which this knowledge culminated is the Qi men dun jia, \"The extraordinary ones, the gate and the hidden shield,\" of possibly the third or fourth century a.d. Known today as a strategy manual that suggests successful moves in both military and social conflicts, it ini-tially may have offered a basis for exploiting numinous forces to achieve the ends of the living. The techniques described almost two millennia ago have not lost their appeal among large segments of the Chinese population and they will appeal to future generations as long as daily life is considered to be a ght, and as long as in the absence of solidarity, distrust is the basic attitude toward one's fellow human beings. In this social context, the techniques of the Qi men dun jia and other such manuals have helped humans to solve personal prob-lems believed to be caused by numinous forces. For example, a patient may approach a priest because of what he or she considers an im-moral desire. The priest is consulted because the \"patient\" is consid-ered to be in the grip of a demon named \"immoral desire.\" The belief in existential heteronomy suggests that this demon must be exorcised. The patient who suffers from an \"immoral desire\" is not believed to Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition xxi change his or her mind out of his or her own will. Rather, the priest needs to enlist specic numinous forces and will take into consider-ation certain days and hours of the day where a natural qi is present to support his approach. He will then write an amulet or voice a spell that is an order and that demands the spirit of \"immoral desire\" to leave his victim, otherwise he will be crushed by a superior force. Countless variations of this type of thinking could be listed here. The creativity of Chinese intellectuals and practitioners' records has generated a most impressive range of related strategies and techniques over the past two millennia. Returning to the issue of existential het-eronomy versus existential self-determination, we may conclude that the Daoists have striven to provide humans with more autonomy. As they acknowledged the existence of good and evil numinous forces, they resorted to a struggle and appealed to power relationships to free the living, at least to a certain degree, from the existential plight inflicted upon them by their otherworldly enemies. If the spirits of the ancestors could be placated by the living, demons had to be fought. People caught in this worldview had no alternatives to achieve at least partial sovereignty over the quality and length of their lives. The Chinese version of Buddhism should be mentioned here, as it came to share with Daoism the belief in a densely populated world of demons and gods to be approached by spells and other apotropaic techniques. In contrast to Daoism though, Buddhism offered hope of a better life in a distant future and promised humans an existence increasingly free of suffering. Eventually even a state of wu bing, \"being free of dis- ease,\" as the early Chinese translation of the Indian concept of nir-vana went, was promised an individual who followed the path of the Buddha's morality. It is here that we turn our eyes to a radically different worldview that has not received sufcient attention in Chinese cognitive histori-ography. Similar to ancient Greece, beginning with the nal phase of the Warring States period (the fourth to third centuries b.c.), the neces- sity of social legislation to ensure a harmonious society led some in-tellectuals to believe that the regularity of certain natural phenomena must also be based on laws. This belief came to be expressed in the yinyang and Five Phases (now termed Five Agents) doctrines. In an- cient Greece an analytical approach appeared early on and came to dominate culture. This approach sought to determine the smallest element in the building of the world and attempted to understand the full picture based on such arguments. In China, however, the op-posite view prevailed: the aim was to view as many relations among xxii Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition things as possible and to understand each individual item and its role in the universe from and as functions within these relations. The yin-yang and Five Agents doctrines focused on the classications and relations of the myriad things, but they conveyed the same general message as science in ancient Europe: there are laws that persist ir-respective of time, space, and human or numinous beings. This is the rst credo underlying the evolution of European science, and it is also the credo at the beginning of Chinese natural science. The second credo, that we are able to recognize these laws, and the third credo, that to know these laws is sufcient to understand the universe and manipulate it at will, were also at the basis of Chinese science. What were the implications of this new worldview for human ex- istential autonomy? It may be worthwhile to take a closer look at the two Chinese concepts in question, ming and fa. The base meaning of ming is \"an order.\" An individual on earth follows an order, perhaps issued by heaven. Ming has also been translated as \"mandate.\" Peo- ple also have a mandate to live, and hence ming has also been trans- lated as \"life.\" Human existence, this term suggests, is heteronomous. Some numinous entity issues a mandate, and may recall it again. The question is: who is this numinous entity in whose hands human life rests? An early answer was given in the Lun yu, considered to be re- cords of the teachings of Confucius. Here we read: \"Death and life are fate (ming), and it depends on heaven whether someone accumu- lates wealth and reaches a noble status.\" 9 This is a straightforward statement. It flatly denies humans autonomy over the length and quality of lives. Ming appears to be a Chinese equivalent of the Greek moira. If the quality and length of human life depend on other-than- human entities, this should include health and illness, and hence we nd in the seventh-century Qian jin yi fang by Sun Simiao (581-682?) a quote allegedly from the father of Daoism, Laozi, pointing out: \"The fact that I suffer is tied to my having a body. If I had no body, what reason could there be for my suffering?\" To this Sun Simiao added his own commentary: \"That is, form and matter are the causes of disease. Only the absence of form is free of suffering. If not even the sages are able to keep suffering at a distance how should a candle in the wind be able to achieve this.\" 10 This passage is interesting. It denies the impact of numinous forces, including heaven, by pointing out that all matter rots, and as long as human life is tied to matter\u2014that is, as long as we have a material body\u2014we cannot escape deterioration or disease. To sum up, the het-eronomy of human physical existence is conditioned here not by nu-Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition xxiii minous forces but by its material nature as such. This is an extremely negative outlook on human life, and it may have been recorded by Sun Simiao to justify his collection of thousands of pharmaceutical recipes to cure disease. With his statement, notably published as late as the Tang dynasty, Sun Simiao explicitly contradicted a key phrase found in one of the seminal texts of Chinese medicine that had been laid out more than half a millennium earlier, some time during the latter Han dynasty. In the Huang Di nei jing su wen, at the very end of chapter 3, an author unknown to us emphasized: \"If the Way is carefully observed as the law [demands], the mandate of heaven will last long.\" This is one of the statements inserted into the Su wen by its late Han editors. We do not know the identities of these persons, and perhaps it was only one single individual, who put together sev-eral hundred small textual pieces of different authorship, and used the occasion to add general political statements. The statement just quoted has no immediate medical implication. It reflects the threefold credo identied earlier. There are laws, fa, and they should lead the way, dao, and if they are followed, one's life does not end prema- turely. This is a claim to at least a limited degree of existential au-tonomy. It is repeated at the end of chapter 74, now with an explicit medical implication: \"If the Way is carefully observed in accordance with the law [just outlined], a myriad successes are achieved in a myriad [cases] taken up. Qi and blood will assume a proper balance and the mandate of heaven will last long.\" The task of medicine is to minimize early death and suffering. This is achieved through medicine's potential for healing disease, and for alerting people to risks that may shorten their lives, or at least gener-ate suffering. Medicine is the cultural tool developed by humankind to obtain control over the length and quality of one's life. In ancient Europe, the concept of natural laws opened the path towards a con-tinuous increase of such existential autonomy. If we look at state-ments found in ancient Chinese sources, it appears that a similar movement was initiated by at least a small segment of Chinese intel-lectuals as well. A well-known and most obvious indicator of such a tendency is found in Tao Hongjing's scripture Yang xing yan ming lu, written around 500 a.d. The very title suggests the quest that is com- monly associated with any type of health care, be it medical or not: \"Records of how to nourish one's nature and extend life.\" This may not sound extraordinary. We should be alerted, though, by a state-ment that offers insight into what must have been a discussion among intellectuals about existential heteronomy versus existential auton-xxiv Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition omy. Tao Hongjing flatly contradicted the statement quoted earlier from the Confucian Lun yu when he stated: \"The classic of the im- mortals says: My life/fate/mandate (ming) rests with me, it does not rest with heaven (tian). But the stupid are not aware that this path (dao) is at the core of life (sheng ming). Hence, they are affected by wind evil causing the hundreds of diseases. The reason is always the same: their unrestrained behavior and the extremes of their desires result in depletion that eventually harms life.\" 11 Unlike the Confucian classic of so many centuries earlier, and in contrast to Sun Simiao of the subsequent Tang dynasty, Tao Hongjing,echoing Xunzi, saw a way out of suffering. Humans have a certain degree of existential self-determination\u2014if we are able to restrain our behavior and to keep our lives free of extreme desires. This is the es-sence of natural laws. Once one understands these laws, one has the freedom to live in accordance. This freedom, in turn, provides an individual with the potential for shaping the length and quality of his or her life, rather than depending upon the whims and arbitrariness of numinous powers. Greek medicine started from similar premises. A question that emerges here is: who determines the laws that show the path toward a healthy long life? Apparently, Tao Hongjing's vision of a healthy lifestyle is that of following a specic morality. We do not know whether he himself would have applied the notion of fa, law, to this morality. Certainly, he believed in standard guidelines that should be followed by humans to prevent suffering and an un-timely death. His words, \"My life/fate/mandate (ming) rests with me, it does not rest with heaven (tian), \" sound deant. He must have had someone in mind, perhaps even as far back as the author of the Lun yu passage quoted above, perhaps some contemporaries, who preached a more submissive attitude. Given all the writings by Tao Hongjingon the interactions between the world of the living and the world of the numinous, he cannot be named as witnessing a tendency to deny the existence of otherworldly forces holding sway over the living. But these forces, it appears, also must acknowledge some eternal moral standards. If humans comply with these standards the numinous must grant the expected reward, that is, a good and long life, possibly extended well into an existence beyond secular life. Returning to the Su wen, we nd many more statements to this effect. In its rst chapter, possibly moved there from a less prominent location in the back of the text by the Tang editor Wang Bing, an anonymous author left another statement contradicting Sun Simiao's fatalistic account: \"When essence and spirit are guarded internally, Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition xxv where could a disease come from?\" People are able to escape illness if only they guard their essence and spirits. That is, humans themselves are responsible, and there is not only hope: there is certainty. Let us recall the notions conveyed, to the present, by writings like the Qi men dun jia. Their authors did not think of appealing to an individ- ual suffering from illicit sexual desires. The priest was forced to enlist the assistance of some strong numinous force to expel a lower-rank-ing demon. In the Su wen, the appeal is directed at the individual. The message conveyed here is clear. Guard essence and spirit, and the promise of a life free of disease will come true. TheSu wen conveys this message implicitly and explicitly. Seem- ingly without links to the textual context, an editor or author has repeatedly interspersed in chapter 56 the phrase \"above and below, the identical law,\" as if repetition of a political slogan increased its impact on the reader. In chapter 25, a rather naturalistic interpreta-tion of life denies the numinous any influence on human life: \"Man comes to life through the qi of heaven and earth; he matures in ac- cordance with the laws of the four seasons.\" Whoever wrote this, he certainly did not acknowledge demons, spirits, or any other numi-nous forces as challenging human existential autonomy. And he made it quite clear who was at the top of the hierarchy of all beings: \"Cov-ered by heaven and carried by the earth, all the myriad beings have come to existence. None has a nobler position than man.\" We do not know of what political persuasion the author of these lines may have been. In general, the explicit emphasis on the necessity to follow the law might point to followers of the school of Legalism. But this might be an erroneous conclusion. After all, the importance offa, whether to be understood as \"model,\" \"standard,\" or \"law,\" was acknowledged by virtually all the social ideologies competing for attention in Chinese antiquity. If we consider the yinyang and FiveAgents doctrines, early Chinese expressions of a recognition of natu-ral laws, we will notice that the entire Su wen, in contrast to pharma- ceutical literature supported by Daoists, is based on such protoscientic thinking. As an author whose text found entrance into chapter 2 noted: \"As for the Way, the sages practice it; the stupid wear it [for decoration only]. If one follows yin and yang, then life results; if one opposes them, then death results. If one follows them, then order results; if one opposes them, then disorder results.\" Life and death are compared here to order and disorder; order is health, and disor-der, as we shall see in other quotes later on, equals disease. All these statements were composed by authors who appear to have supported xxvi Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition the credo underlying science. Health is an issue of existential auton- omy. Follow the laws, and you are safe. Disease results from disobey-ing the laws. Hence, again in contrast to Sun Simiao, who collected thousands of recipes to counter what he considered the inevitable, an author in chapter 2 of the Su wen expounded an entirely different worldview: \"the sages did not treat those already ill, but treated those not yet ill, they did not put in order what was already in disorder, but put in order what was not yet in disorder.\" That is, the sages knew how to treat the healthy body, and so did not need to treat diseases. The translation of this passage obfuscates the fact that to express the concepts of \"treating\" and \"ordering,\" the ancient author used the same term: zhi.He could have juxtaposed liao, \"treating a disease,\" with zhi, \"ordering a social community.\" His use of zhiin both con- texts must have been deliberate and evidences the intention of em-phasizing the parallels between medical and political ends. As if this were not enough to demonstrate that medicine is simply used here as a metaphor to push a political message, we nd the origin of this statement in the writings of the second-century b.c. political philoso- pher Xunzi who said: \"The noble man orders what is ordered; he does not order what is in disorder.\" 12For Xunzi, the path ( dao) to be followed had been laid out by the sages of earlier times. They had introduced the dao as an eternally valid compass that every man should own, and he too emphasized the importance of the law, fa, for social order and stability when he pointed out in his discourse on the \"Grand Embodiment of the Perfect Way\": \"if the law is perfected, then the state has constancy.\" 13 Reading through these and other sources leaves one with the im- pression that on the surface Chinese protoscience and medicine seemed to follow the same credo as in ancient Greece. Some intellec-tuals began to believe in natural laws and they questioned older con-cepts of existential heteronomy. But below this surface, the situation as it developed in China differed profoundly from the history of med-icine in Europe. In Chinese history, the close ties of natural laws to morality may have been severed by some authors, but they were never severed for good. Perhaps there were some authors, and a rereading of ancient Chinese sources may conrm this, who rejected the links between natural laws and morality on grounds that were accepted in Europe: the former are truly natural, while the latter is man-made. In Europe, numerous theologians and philosophers have discussed the issue of \"natural law\" and some have sought to place God even as subject to natural law, or at least let natural law be part of divine Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition xxvii creation. But all these attempts at keeping nature and its regularities within the power of the numinous have been only partially success-ful. Beginning with the Renaissance, European culture, in addition to seeing its religious beliefs weaken, has gradually witnessed the rise of an amoral, purely secular understanding of the universe. The results of this tendency are only too obvious. With their failure to shed the ties between natural laws and morality, Chinese intellectuals severely lim-ited the degree of existential autonomy that could be achieved by be-lieving in the yinyang and Five Agents doctrines, and the all-pervasive forces of qi. Existential autonomy is limited in Europe too. People have to respect the limits set by natural laws, for instance the law of gravity. We may be able to construct airplanes and high-rise build-ings, but the limits nevertheless remain. However, in Europe, natural science at least promised moral autonomy. The laws of physics and chemistry, and the technology derived from their application, work for the good as they do for the evil, and there is no punishment to be expected from nature if an individual's intentions or deeds fail to com-ply with standard moral norms. In China, natural science did not shed these ties. Those who wish for a good and long life, and are willing to act in accordance with the requirements of the yinyang and Five Agents doctrines, will not only have to watch their food habits, clothing, ris-ing and resting, and sexual activities, they will also have to watch their thoughts and refrain from morally unbecoming endeavors. More important, however, for an understanding of the fundamen- tal difference between the cultural roles of medicine in China and Europe is the lack of a potential for political and metaphysical libera-tion in the Chinese understanding of laws, be they social or natural. In ancient Greece, social laws were introduced in the polis to further the political autonomy of the citizens. They served to limit the politi-cal influence of aristocrats and monarchy and the rich. Social law in ancient Greece was the cradle of European democracy. Even though polis democracy was followed by two millennia of autocratic rule, its ideals never vanished entirely until eventually the old order broke down and social revolutions occurred at many places. The introduc-tion of social law appears to have encouraged a belief in the existence of natural law. In the sixth and fth centuries b.c. no one could ob- serve the existence of natural law. A few regularities, yes, but the as-sumption that these regularities, indeed all occurrences in the universe, followed a path dened by natural laws may be seen as a projection of the value of laws for society onto the entire natural universe. Right from the beginning, the belief in natural laws was seen as a xxviii Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition threat to the belief in gods, symbolized by the capital punishment of Socrates for blasphemy. As the introduction of social laws limited the social heteronomy of citizens, and tried to put an end to the whims and arbitrariness of rulers, the belief in natural laws limited, and eventually, for an increasing number of people, ended the existential heteronomy of humankind. Thus, science came to be caught in an eternal contradiction with religion. The attempts of noted church fathers, especially in the Middle Ages, to reconcile the obviously use-ful sciences with the logics of a belief in divine almightiness are many, but they are all unsuited to change the basic fact: either you believe in natural laws or you believe in the unfathomable decisions of the gods or God. 14In the nal analysis, the two worldviews are mutually exclusive. Individuals who believe in God may make use of the re-sults of science; they may fly in airplanes and make phone calls with their cellular phones. But the very idea of science, that is, the belief in an existence of natural laws not affected by time, space, and numi-nous or secular persons, contradicts the concept of a god, demon, or ancestor acting at will, and thereby keeping a faulty airplane from crashing. Early Chinese science clearly had a different origin. The notion of an existence of natural laws found entrance into the minds of some intellectuals, but it was unrelated to any quest for social liberation. An attempt was made to grant humankind a higher degree of existen-tial self-determination by denying a concept of ming as being in the hands of heaven, and by pointing out a path, dao, that allows one to lead a long and healthy life. Such assertions are made in various sources, some linked with Daoist authors, such as Tao Hongjing,others with authors apparently closer to Confucian-Legalist thinkers, like Xunzi. Nonetheless, such views were never tied to any consistent attempt at ridding humankind from the belief in the tyranny of gods, demons, ancestors, or other such numinous beings. They were to be kept at bay by alliances with higher powers, or they were only tacitly acknowledged, but they were recognized. There certainly was a de-bate whether to continue such belief, and Mozi, the cynic, responded to such requests by pointing out the value of fear in having the popu-lation refrain from immoral behavior. No major stimulus kept this debate alive in the millennia after the Han dynasty, and Chinese soci-ety at large continued to believe in the ability of gods, demons, and ancestors to control the quality and length of human life. The sharp dividing line between social forces rejecting such existential heteron-omy on the one side, and religious groups ercely objecting to a pos-Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition xxix sibility of existential autonomy on the other\u2014which has characterized European society for so many centuries\u2014did not emerge in China. Itdid not emerge because the very notion of feudal rule, that is, of so-cial heteronomy, was never effectively questioned. The continuous failure of rulers in preimperial and imperial times to exhibit exem-plary behavior stimulated the creators of social doctrines to think of and suggest ways to convince rulers to adhere to certain moral stan-dards. A democratic system, where citizens could participate in regu-lating their affairs, was at best an issue pursued by some thinkers of marginal influence. With the almost unconditional acceptance by virtually all major Chinese social ideologies of a far-reaching social and existential het-eronomy, and given the nature of the Chinese science doctrines of systematic correspondences, the most serious conflicts marking the history of medicine in Europe could not emerge in China. The yin-yang and Five Agents doctrines are relational science. They may be well suited to explain some relationships and their effects in society and in humankind's natural environment. They may even explain a Chinese superiority in social, economic, and military strategies over the West. 15 But in contrast to Europe's analytical science, relational science is unable to generate a technology that permits humankind to overcome many of the limits that constrain our natural existence. Chinese relational science has been the source of many impressive artifacts, some of which have been cherished and transmitted to this very day. An example is the doctrine of the Five Periods and Six Qi (wu yun liu qi) inserted into the Huang Di Nei jing su wen by Wang Bing during the Tang dynasty. 16 This rather voluminous text of ap- proximately thirty thousand characters is devoted to calculating the regularities of climatic change and to assisting people in adapting to these changes and thereby to remain healthy and enjoy a long life. The doctrine of the Five Periods and Six Qi is entirely secular; it does not acknowledge any numinous forces. It rests on the assumption that the climatic characteristics of any day, season, or year are conditioned by the dynamics of qi. The origins and rationale of these dynamics are not to be explained; they are simply there. If one wishes to lead a long and happy life, one should be prepared to live in harmony with these dynamics. The doctrine of the Five Periods and Six Qi was devel- oped by unknown authors during the Han dynasty; it was transmit-ted through unknown channels until eventually Wang Bing provided them with public recognition at some time in the eighth century. As so many other strategies in Chinese health care, they reflect a desire xxx Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition of the inhabitants of China that is identical with that of the people in Europe. The exploitation of countless pharmaceutical substances (be they gathered in nature or man-made), dietetics, needling, moxibus-tion, and so on all serve to help humans to maintain or to regain health, and if this is impossible, to mitigate suffering. Where these facets of health care were given a theoretical underpinning, it was one deduced from the principles of relational science. European medicine has known the relational worldview too, but it has resisted temptations to grant relational worldviews a dominant position. European medicine has instead focused on analytical sci-ence from early on. Dissection and anatomy, as well as in later times the development and application of chemical and physical explana-tory models, were closely tied to this focus on analytical science. The potential of analytical science has made many representatives of Eu-ropean medicine believe that before long they will have the nal tools required for existential autonomy. With biochemistry, biophysics, and biotechnology, it appears, the length and the quality of human life can be improved at human will. However, how far humans may go in their attempts at preventing, alleviating, and curing suffering is a question that has sparked conflict in Europe from the very beginning. The defenders of spiritual hegemony, of God's almightiness have ercely objected to all seminal breakthroughs in the history of Euro-pean medicine, be it the development of anatomy, the introduction of vaccination, the discovery of pain-free delivery, and, in recent times, a wide range of technology-based methods to help humans overcome, for example, the pain of childlessness by means of articial reproduc-tion. Stem cell research and cloning have provoked the wrath of the advocates of existential heteronomy just as prenatal diagnosis and abortion have. This is a conflict that knows no compromise. Chinese culture has not acknowledged such antagonisms. First, this is true because relational science did not have the potential for developing the tools required by humankind to achieve a degree of existential autonomy similar to that reached by European analytical science. Second, it is because no social force existed in two millennia of Chinese imperial culture that might have striven for a social and existential autonomy of the people vis-\u00e0-vis their earthly government or their celestial numinous rulers. Marxism, a social ideology imported from Europe and reinterpreted by Chinese intellectuals in the early twentieth century, has massively challenged spiritual heteronomy for the rst time in Chinese history, and thereby marginalized, at least for the time being, the religious aspects of Chinese traditional culture. ItPreface to the 25th Anniversary Edition xxxi has also recognized that Chinese medicine was tied to and part of a science that offered no hope for successfully countering the superior technological heteronomy that the West imposed on China. It is there-fore that the communist government of the People's Republic of China, while continuing to pay lip-service to impressive achievements and the benets of Chinese medicine in the distant past, dismissed rela-tional science as a basis of health care and replaced it with analytical science right from the beginning. This political strategy of survival in a world where supremacy can be achieved only on the basis of ana-lytical science has resulted in the so-called Traditional Chinese Medi-cine (TCM), an articial product of the 1950s and 1960s. 17 TCM is based on the rationale of modern analytical science, and while the Chinese authorities are cautious enough not to proceed too hastily, in November 2008 they saw the time had come to give the old Chinese medicine, based on relational science, a nal deathblow when they proposed in the Beijing Declaration that the future of TCM lies in molecular biology and related analytical life sciences. With this move, the end of Chinese medicine as an independent health care ideology has been ofcially conrmed. The cultural environment that has kept this medicine alive for exactly two millennia has vanished, and a medicine that has lost its cultural environment has lost its lifeline and is bound to perish. Western analytical science will examine drugs, therapeutic techniques, and some concepts, and it will, where possi-ble, provide their effects with a new scientic rationale. Many people in the West who are unhappy with the rigid antispiritualism of so-called biomedicine, who complain of a lack of humanity in biomedi-cine, and who believe that TCM is natural and holistic will continue to project their quest for an alternative onto Chinese medicine, and they will nd much relief, because health care interventions may be effective for various reasons, and not all of them reveal their causality in double-blind experiments. Any child who has gone through grade- and high-school education, whether it be in China or in the West, who has been taught to use computers and to learn the basics of biology, will be unable to return to the relational thinking that has been the foundation of Chinese medicine for two thousand years. People with an interest in Chinese medicine, wherever they have grown up, will have to study relational science like a foreign language, but unlike a foreign language, relational science no longer has a geographical ba-sis where it is a native language, spoken and understood by all. Medicine in China: A History of Ideas was written in the early 1970s at a time when almost no results of academic research on the xxxii Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition evolution of Chinese medicine were available. It was meant to be a rst overview of the basic cognitive traditions underlying the devel-opment of health care in China from their documented beginnings to the present. In the meantime, Chinese medicine has become an ac-knowledged scholarly pursuit. The inseparable connection between the origin, acceptance, and change of medical concepts and their so-cial, economic, and political environment, so controversially dis-cussed when Medicine in China: A History of Ideas appeared, has been accepted as a truism and many blanks in our historiography have been lled in. 18 My own contribution has focused on the analy- sis of seminal texts. They include the Nan jing of the Han dynasty, a book that has exerted a lasting impact, not only in China but also in Japan, on the practice of acupuncture and diagnosis; 19 the Yin hai jing wei of the fteenth/sixteenth century, as an example of an early Chinese medical specialty (ophthalmology) text;20 the Yi xue yuan liu lun by Xu Dachun of the eighteenth century as a rst example of a reflection by a Chinese intellectual-physician on the nature of medi-cine; 21 and more recently the Huang Di Nei jing su wen of the Han dynasty.22 The latter offers unprecedented insights into the early dy- namics of Chinese medical thinking during the formative period of Chinese medicine. The more such data are made available to audi-ences in the West, the more obvious it becomes that health care in China was multifaceted and ideologically multicentered. Health care in general and medicine in particular in China have evolved continu-ously. The present volume ended at a time when it was not clear to outsiders which direction the Chinese government was aiming at in the treatment of its health care heritage. Since China opened its bor-ders in the late 1970s, it has become clear that the Chinese authorities have unconditionally opted for a future based on analytical science. Inthe general public, though, a debate continues on the benets to be derived from cultivating relational science (spoken of here as xi tong lun) and analytical science (called huan yuan lun ) simultaneously. Nevertheless, as pointed out initially, the chapter of Chinese medicine as an independent health care system is irrevocably closed. This makes it all the more interesting to study the history of ideas of Chinese medicine as a phenomenon that has spanned two thousand years from beginning to end. Much further research is required to fully understand all the ramications and details of the Chinese quest for health. Medicine in China: A History of Ideas offers the necessary rst overview.Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition xxxiii Notes to the Preface 1.
