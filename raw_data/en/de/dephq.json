A slight variation in the deo xyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence can result in a subtle change in a protein which translates into major differences in how the protein functions. The study of variations in DNA sequence as related to d rug response is referred to as pharmacogenetics, an d pharmacogenetic testing involves genotyping to detect relevant vari ants. Genetic variations can be associated with sub optimal drug response, for example poor efficacy or adverse events. A pharmacogenetic test is meant to guide treatment strategies, patient evaluations and decisions based on its ability to predict response to treatment in particular clinical contex ts. When testing is targeted to evaluate an individ ual's response to a specific drug, typically only one gene is analyzed. For warf arin, also known as Coumadin, two to three genes ar e tested. However, laboratories have developed Multi-Gene Panels inclu ding five or more genes in order to proactively eva luate an individual's possible response to many drugs. This policy is des igned to address Multi-Gene Panel testing. Clinical Evidence Anxiety and Depression Up to 42% of variance in therapy response for major depressive disorders (MDD) can be explained by gen etic variation (Tansey et al., 2013), which has led to the development of pharmacogenetic (PGx) tests to inform the use of ce rtain psychiatric medications. Prospective randomized clinical trials have been performed to validate the clinical valid ity and utility of a number of PGx multi-gene panels. In a Canadian participant- and rater- blinded controlled trial (RCT), Tiwari et al. (2022) ev aluated clinical outcomes for patients with a diagnosis of depression whose t reatment was guided by combinatorial pharmacogenomi was a 3-arm, 52-week, multi-center trial primari ly evaluating symptom improvement using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) at week 8, as well as second ary outcomes including response ( 50% decrease in HAM-D17) and Pharmacogeneti c Panel Testing Page 4 of 16 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 07/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyri ght 2023 United HealthCare Services, Inc. remission (HAM-D17 7) at week eight. The participants were randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment arms, including two intervention arms and a TAU arm. For the first inte rvention arm (n = 147), the providers received the standard combinatorial pharmacogenomic test report to guide treatment (GEN arm). The second intervention arm included partici pants (n = 152) for whom the providers received an enhanced test report to guide treatment (EGEN - 6 additional genes) and the final arm was TAU (n = 138). The researchers found that individua ls in the pharmacogenomically guided groups had gre ater symptom improvement (27.6% versus 22.7%), response (30.3% and remission rates (15.7% versus 8.3% ) compared to TAU, but the differences found were not statistical ly significant. Since they felt that this trial was underpowered to detect statistically meaningful differences in outcomes, t he authors did a parallel assessment with the U.S. \"GUIDED\" trial results (discussed in Greden et al., 2019, below). They fou nd consistent results related to relative improveme nts in response and remission rates between GAPP-MDD (33.0% response, 8 9% remission) and GUIDED (31.0% response, 51.0% rem ission) and concluded that in the context of the Canadian univer sal healthcare setting, GAPP-MDD and GUIDED RCTs sup port the use of combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing as an effecti ve tool to help guide treatment of depression. A systematic review to summarize and assess the sta te of evidence regarding the use of PGx testing in individuals with depression was performed by Aboelbaha et al. in 202 1. The researchers queried scientific databases fro m inception through June 30, 2020 for RCTs and systematic reviews which assessed clinical utility of PGx testing for treatm ent of depression. A total of six systematic reviews and three RCTs ultimately met criteria for inclusion in this study. The resul ts provided evidence on efficacy of PGx testing, with newer RCTs of better q uality showing clinical promise regarding efficacy outcomes, especially in participants with gene-drug interactions. The resea rchers state that PGx testing before initiation of treatment or during therapy may improve efficacy outcome and recommend further studies to assess impact of PGx testing on safety o utcomes. Authors Brown et al. (2020), Bousman et al. (2019) and Rose nblat et al. (2018), previously discussed in this p olicy, were included in the Aboelbaha systematic review. Mench\u00f3n et al. (2019) examined the influence of pat ient characteristics such as age, baseline severity , and duration of episode on the clinical utility of PGx testing for psychiat ric drugs from the AB-GEN study, a randomized 12-we ek long study comparing TAU to PGx guided therapy selection in 280 adults w ith MDD. The primary outcomes analyzed were the Pat ient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scale and the Ham ilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17). Patients g enerally showed no difference in sustained response at the 12-week end point between the TAU and PGx group (P\u00e9rez et al., 2017). However, the PGx group had a higher response rate than TAU, and when subjects were removed whose physicians did not follow the genetic testing recommendations, the response rate improved further. Side effects were less in the PGx group b y 6 weeks, which was maintained at week 12. The primary dependent variab le identified was the number of previously failed m edication trials. In the Mench\u00f3n et al. (2019) reanalysis by patient demogra phics, additional important variables were identifi ed. Age was important as PGx testing significantly improved outcomes in thos e under age 60, but not over age 60. Outcomes were also improved in those with moderate to severe depression, but not i n those with mild depression. Genetic testing impro ved PGI-I in one year or less from diagnosis, but not HAM-D17. The effect on HAM-D17 was not significant until the cutoff from time of diagnosis was increased to 5 years. After this, however, a null e ffect was seen, and individuals who were more than 5 years from their diagnosis were actually worse off in the PGx arm th an TAU. To determine which type of patient is most likely to benefit from PGx testing for psychiatric therapies, more prospec tive, randomized trials are needed. GUIDED is a 24-week RCT conducted between April 2014 and February 2017 comparing active treatment group s guided by PGx information, to active treatment groups receivi ng usual care (TAU) for MDD (Greden et al., 2019). Sixty sites participated, and patients were referred to the study when it was self, or clinician reported to have inadequate res ponse to at least one antidepressant. The average number of medications f ailed in the cohort was three, making this a diffic ult to treat population. Genotyping was HTR2A, and SLC6A4 and reported using a proprietary PGx algorithm from Assurex Health. Participants were b linded to the study arm, but clinicians were not, since they needed to consult the PGx results to guide treatment. Using t he results to guide treatment was not mandated. Patients were assessed at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks using the HAM-D17, which w as administered by blinded raters. A total of 1167 enrolled patients m ade it through week 8 with 607 in TAU and 560 in PG x guided. HAM-D17 scores decreased in the TAU arm by 24% and in the P Gx arm by 27%, but the difference was not statistic ally significant. Treatment response, defined as 50% decrease in de pression, was greater in the PGx arm (26%) than TAU (20%). The depression remission rate, defined as score of 7 for HAM-D17, was 10% with TAW and 15% with PGx (p = .007). Additionally, at week 8, there was no difference between the grou ps in reported side effects. When patients taking i ncongruent medications were evaluated as a separate cohort, those who swit ched to congruent medications by week 8 experienced significantly fewer side effects. Medication prescriptions that aligned with PGx results at baseline were 77% in the TAU g roup and 79% in the PGx group. By week 8, the PGx group increased to 91%, a nd the TAU group was unchanged. After 8 weeks, clin icians in the TAU Pharmacogeneti c Panel Testing Page 5 of 16 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 07/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyri ght 2023 United HealthCare Services, Inc. arm were unblinded and could use the PGx results if they chose. A total of 913 participants completed through week 24 with 456 in TAU and 457 in the PGx guided arm. Overall, in the PGx group, HAM-D17 scores decreased by 43% a t week 24 relative to baseline. Response and remission increased by 70 % and 100%, respectively, from week 8 to week 24. W hile the primary outcome being analyzed, symptom improvement at week 8, was not different between the two groups, there was significant difference in response and remission in the PGx gro up on other measures. A panel of ten genes with select polymorphisms comb ined with a proprietary algorithm, the NeuroIDgenet ix \u00ae Test, was the subject of a RCT to evaluate clinical utility for gu iding treatment for depression and anxiety (Bradley et al., 2018). were identified from 20 independent clinical sites in th e US that represented psychiatry, internal medicine , family medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology. A total of 685 patients were included in the study, ranging in age from 19 to 87, and all had a diagnosis of depression or anxiety using the DSM-V criteria and verified by the MINI Psychiatric Inter view. Most were female (73%) with diagnoses of depression (n = 246), anxie ty (n = 235) or both (n = 204). Participants were e ither 'New to Treatment' (newly diagnosed or taking medications for less tha n 6 weeks) or 'Inadequately Controlled' with medica tions as defined by lack of efficacy or treatment discontinuation due to adv erse events or intolerability; although the authors did not report the distribution. PGx testing was performed in all subj ects but was only shared with the physicians of tho se in the PGx arm. Patients were assessed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks using the HAM-D1 7 and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) , with their physicians blinded to the results. Adverse events w ere captured via the Adverse Drug Event form develo ped by external psychiatric consultants, and a blinded clinician ra nked the adverse events on a severity scale. The PG x testing group showed a greater response and remission rate with odds ratio s of 4.72 and 3.54 respectively, than the TAU group at 12 weeks. In the anxiety group, those that received testing had a hi gher response rate at 8 and 12 weeks with an odds r atio of 1.76, compared to the TAU group. Physicians made at least one medicat ion change in 81% of those receiving testing than t he control group (64%) at the two-week time point when results were return ed to physicians. No difference was found in advers e drug events between the two treatment groups. In a post-hoc analysis on the 'Inadequately Controlled' cohort remission rat es (42% vs. 27%, p = 0.03) and response rates (62% vs. 44%, p = 0.01) response rates were greater with PGx than TAU. Perlis et al. (2018) reported on a propensity-score matched case-control analysis of health claims dat a from a US payer that examined the longitudinal claims of individuals wit h a mood or anxiety disorder. Claims from individual s who had received the Genecept PGx ten gene test from Genomind were compa red to case-matched controls who matched on gender, age, and diagnosis who did not receive testing. Diagnoses th at were included were depressive disorders, any anx iety diagnosis, bipolar disorder, and any substance abuse diagnosis. Co-morb idities that were accounted for in the analysis inc luded hyperlipidemia, low back pain, hypertension, migraine and other hea daches, diabetes mellitus, and any mental health vi sit. Of the 1639 individuals who received genetic testing, it was po ssible to match 817. Patients who had PGx testing h ad 40% fewer emergency room visit for any cause and 58% fewer hospitalizat ions for any cause. There was no difference between the groups in the number of psychiatric medications prescribed, or mo od disorder related inpatient hospitalizations. Sel ection bias, since this was an observational study, was a physician that or dered genetic testing might, in theory, be more agg ressive in-patient management. The study's authors concluded that rand omized prospective clinical trials are needed to fu rther validate the clinical utility of genetic testing for psychiatric disorders. Jung et al. (2017) conducted a genome-wide associat ion study (GWAS) in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (G AD) to identify potential predictors of venlafaxine XR treatment ou tcome. Ninety-eight European American patients part icipated in a venlafaxine XR clinical trial for GAD, with Hamilto n Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) response/remission at 24 we eks as the primary outcome measure. All participants were genotyped wi th the Illumina PsychChip, and 266,820 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed. Although no SNP s reached genome-wide significance, eight SNPs were marginally associated with treatment response/remission and HA M-A reduction at week 12 and 24 (p < 0.00001). The authors concluded that several identified genes may indicate markers crossing neuropsychiatric diagnostic categories. Th e authors acknowledged that the limitations of this study include small sa mple size and the lack of statistical power for a G WAS. Areas for future research include the replication of results with la rger samples sizes to increase statistical power an d further elucidate the treatment effects of antidepressant venlafaxine XR on GAD. Researchers enrolled 528 (outpatients and inpatient s) from 18 hospitals and associated mental health c enters in Spain from July 2014 to June 2015 in the AB-GEN study, a 12-we ek, double-blind, parallel, multi-center RCT to eval uate the effectiveness of PGx testing for drug therapy guidance for MDD. Pati ents with a CGI-S 4 and requiring antidepressant m edication de novo or changes in their medication were randomized to a PG x or TAU group. PGx testing was conducted by Neurop harmagen, and results were reported using their web-based clinica l decision support tool. Thirty genes and relevant single nucleotide Pharmacogeneti c Panel Testing Page 6 of 16 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 07/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyri ght 2023 United HealthCare Services, Inc. polymorphisms were analyzed. The primary endpoint w as measuring a sustained response on the Patient Gl obal Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) of 2 within the 12-week follo w-up. Follow up was conducted by phone, and the int erviewer was blinded to the participant's study arm. A patient was consider ed to have a sustained response with a PGI-I score of 2 or less if they reported their condition to be \"much better\" or \"ve ry much better.\" Only 280 of 528 patients completed the study. A difference in sustained response was not observed between PGx and TAU at 12 weeks. Overall, the PGx group had a m uch higher response rate, and this improved when removing the patients whose physicians did not follow the PGx re commendations. Effects were greatest in patients who had failed up to three prior medications. Of those who reported side effects at baseline, the PGx group was more likely to report fewer side effects than the TAU group (P\u00e9rez et al., 2017). Th is study is interesting as it uses real world practices and clinicians, a heterog eneous population with variable disease states and prior treatment failures, and clinicians could choose to not follow the PGx r ecommendations. Additional studies are needed to re plicate these findings across larger, ethnically diverse study groups. Cardiovascular Disease The evidence regarding use of multigene PGx testing for cardiac disease is limited at this time. High- quality studies demonstrating improved outcomes related to use of P Gx testing in individuals with cardiac conditions a nd/or undergoing cardiac interventions are required. Ratner et al. (2022) explored the impact of multige ne PGx testing on individuals undergoing percutaneo us coronary intervention (PCI) and bone marrow transplant. Frequ ency of prescription for 65 medications with action able PGx recommendations were obtained for all participants and a simulation was used to then project the numbe r of opportunities for PGx-guided prescribing. In the PCI group (215 indivi duals), 66.5% of participants were prescribed at le ast one medication that had actionable PGx prescribing recommendations avai lable. Using the simulations, if multigene PGx were available, 26.5 prescribing opportunities per 100 individuals under going PCI were projected. The authors indicated thei r belief that multigene PGx testing may offer potential to improve medicati on prescribing in individuals undergoing PCI. Howeve r, additional high quality studies are needed to further investigate t he role of PGx testing for individuals undergoing P CI. Two hundred and eleven patients from the University of Florida (UF) who underwent percutaneous coronar y intervention (PCI) were included in a study to analyze the benefits of genotype-guided prescribing of PGx drugs and exami ne the clinical utility of multigene panel testing. Genotype data for five gen es (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, VKORC1, SLCO1B1) was compil ed Seventy-seven percent of UF patients e xhibited at least one actionable phenotype for thes e five genes; 32% had opportunities for genotype-guided prescribing of me dications. The data was then used as parameter esti mates in a simulation model to predict genotype-guided opportunities amon g privately insured beneficiaries in the MarketScan database who had undergone PCI with at least one and five years of fo llow-up data (n = 105,547 and n = 12,462, respectiv ely). Fifty percent of the individuals who had undergone PCI with over one year and 68% with over five years of follow-up were tak ing at least one CPIC A/B drug in addition to prescribed antiplatelet the rapy. A 39% and 52% incidence of genotype-guided pr escribing opportunity at one and five years, respectively, was projected. The authors hypothesized that panel-based testing at the time of PCI could result in genotype-driven prescribing decisions in 1/3 of patients, thereby improving therapy outcomes beyond that of CYP2C19 alone for antiplatelet therapy. (Rouby et al ., 2020) The real-world clinical utility of PGx testing for managing cardiovascular disease was studied by Bill ings et al. (2018). A retrospective cohort of individuals was identified through pharmaceutical, medical and laboratory clai ms data from a national health insurer from January 2011 through September 2015. Baseline data and outcomes were measured over a 12-month period. Individuals who received PGx testing that i ncluded CYP2C19, CYP2C9, VKORC1, F5, F2, and MTHFR were matched to controls based on demographics and diagnoses. PGx t esting was ordered at the physician's discretion an d was not influenced by the study. The total number of individuals teste d was 11,060 and 178,096 matched controls were iden tified. Outcomes evaluated through claims data included pharmacy cos ts, medical costs, emergency room visits, outpatien t visits, emergency room stays, controlling for demographics, coverage type, low income, cardiovascular disease, and other co-morbidities, such as diabetes. The PGx test group appeared significan tly more likely to experience stroke, pulmonary emb olism, deep vein thrombosis, or a composite event than the control g roup. Real world PGx testing did not appear to impr ove outcomes based on claims analysis.

Copyri ght 2023 United HealthCare Services, Inc. Anthracyclines The routine use of PGx panel testing in assessment of risk related to chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxic ity (CIC) is not supported by the evidence at this time. Although th e initial research shows promise for potential bene fit, additional prospective studies with long-term follow-up are needed for val idation of the role of PGx related to CIC. Yang et al. (2021) conducted a systematic review an d meta-analysis to examine the correlation between genomic variants and CIC. The review and analysis included forty-one studi es examining the relationship between genetic varia nts and CIC, including 88 unique genes and 154 single nucleotide polymorph isms (SNPs). The results revealed that six variants had an association with increased risk of concluded that this study revealed promising pote ntial benefits of pharmacogenomic testing prior to chemotherapy to mi nimize the risk of CIC, however further studies are r equired to validate the prognostic and diagnostic roles of the six iden tified variants in predicting CIC. Anthracyclines are an important category of chemoth erapeutic agents for hematological and solid tumors but are associated with a high rate of anthracycline associated cardio toxicity (ACT) that can result in symptoms during th erapy or even years after therapy is completed. S\u00e1gi et al. (2018) conducted genotyping of 26 genes and 70 single nucleotide pol ymorphisms (SNPs) associated with anthracycline metabolism and retros pective review of medical records of 622 pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 39 osteosarcoma (OSC) patients tr eated between 1989 and 2015 in Hungarian pediatric oncology centers. Patients with comorbidities such as Down syndrome o r prior cardiac findings were excluded. Blood sampl es were taken on ALL patients in remission. All patients were followed b y echocardiography routinely during and after treat ment, and retrospective chart review examined the following categories; at baseline (used as a control), in the acute phase, d uring oral maintenance, at the end of treatment, 2-3 post diagnosis, 5-10 year s after diagnosis, and 10-15 years post diagnosis. SNPs in ABCC2, NQO1, SLC22A6, and SLC28A3 were associated with decreased fractional shortening and ejection fraction, partic ularly in the 5-10- year period after diagnosis. NQO1 SNP rs1043470 T w as associated with lower left ventricular function in the acute phase and 5-10 years post diagnosis. CYP3A5 rs4646450 TT was found in 17% of ALL individuals with anthracycline associated cardiotoxicity (ACT) with a fractional shortening le ss than 28, and appeared to be more prominent in ACT overall, particularly in boys and the ALL group. Additional studies are need ed that are prospective with long term follow up to further understand how PGx testing can contribute to understanding ACT. Pain Management Although the evidence for use of PGx panel testing related to pain management is evolving, the use of multi-gene panel testing for predicting response, side effects, dependence o r improving overall treatment outcomes is currently not supported as safe or efficacious by the peer-reviewed, published lite rature. In a systematic 2022 review, Zobdeh et al. examined the impact of PGx on safety and efficacy of non-st eroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antidepressants when they are us ed for treatment of pain. A total of 25 articles me t inclusion criteria and were reviewed in the analysis. Interactions applica ble for use in pain management were detected for 10 drug/gene note that the PGx studies identified focuse d on the role of genes in the CYP family for NSAIDs, but the number of studies that investigated the impact of these varia nts on pain relief are very limited and detected on ly small impact of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 on therapeutic effect. Overall, there is a lack of well powered studies investigating PGx in individuals being treated for pain with NSAIDs and antidepressants. Although a higher risk for more severe side effects for CYP2C 9 poor metabolizers and NSAIDs was observed, the researchers concluded that larger in vivo studies are required to further investigate the efficacy regarding use of PGx of NSAIDs and antidepressants in pain management. To determine whether PGx testing may be used to eff ectively customize postoperative pain management af ter a total joint replacement, Hamilton et al. (2022) conducted a pro spective RCT including 107 individuals undergoing hi p or knee arthroplasty. PGx testing was performed using a pan el of 16 genes including CYP2D6, CYP2C9, OPRM1, and CYP 1A2, which have an impact on pharmacodynamics of NSAIDs and ma ny opioids. Participants were blinded and randomize d to either a control group (n = 46) or custom group (n = 61). Th e control group received prescriptions for oxycodon e, tramadol and celecoxib for their postoperative pain. In the cust om group, if variants indicating these drugs would not be normally metabolized were found via PGx testing, alternative drugs (hydromorphone, meloxicam) were prescribed. Participants recorded Pharmacogeneti c Panel Testing Page 8 of 16 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 07/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyri ght 2023 United HealthCare Services, Inc. pain levels and medications used for 10 days follow ing surgery and medication used was converted to mi lligram morphine equivalents (MME). The researchers found that genet ic variations to medications in the standard pain m anagement protocol occurred in 22.4% of participants. The 10-day MME i n the control group for those individuals who had g enetic variants was 162.6 mg. In the custom group, individuals with var iants and custom medications used only 86.7 mg in t he same timeframe. The control group also had a higher 10-day average pain level than the custom group (4.2 vs. 3.1, resp ectively, p < 0.05). The authors concluded that with custom postoperative pa in medication prescriptions based on results of PGx testing, individuals undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty had better pain control and reduced consumption of pain medication , however they acknowledge that this study was small, especially s ince the genetic variations of greatest interest ar e rare. In a 2021 systematic review, Rodriguez et al. exami ned the efficacy and safety of opioid therapy guide d by PGx testing. Out of 3,794 records found, five met inclusion criteria fo r data extraction. Of the five studies, two reporte d significant pain improvement related to PGx-guided therapy in indivi duals with a high risk CYP2D6 phenotype. The authors concluded that evidence on the safety and efficacy of using PGx te sting to guide intervention in opioid therapy for c hronic and postoperative pain is very limited. In 2020 (updated 2022), Hayes published a Clinical U tility Evaluation of pharmacogenetic and pharmacoge nomic testing related to opioid use disorders. Hayes found insuff icient evidence to either predict risk of opioid de pendence or improve treatment for patients with opioid use disorder. In addition, a Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2019 a, updated 2021) found limited, low-quality evidence regarding pharmacogen ng and general opioids with respect to improved opioid related treatment outcomes in adult patients with pain. Lastly, another Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2019b updated 202 1) found insufficient evidence to report or refute the clinical utility of OPRM1 or COMT genotyping for pain management in pati ents with organic causes of pain. Muriel et al. (2019) conducted a six-month, observa tional, prospective study on the use of PGx testing for 88 patients involved in long term opioid deprescription treatment of non-ca ncer related pain in the Pain Unit of Alicante Gene ral Hospital in Spain. Visits were monitored and analyzed based on various genotypes. Visits included baseline, follow-up and final, and other parameters tracked were opioid rotation or disconti nuation, adverse drug events and suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Genotyping consisted of the following genes and var iants (C8622T). Five patients were lost to follow up. The remaining participants were 64% female and 100% Caucasian. In the baseline visit, a median of 6 adverse events were recorded including dry mouth, constipation, sleep disruption, and depression. There was no difference recorded in ADRs from baseline through final visit s. A total of 1659 ADRs were reported in 359 visits for this cohort, and th e most common by system classification were psychia tric (21%) and gastrointestinal (20%). At the baseline visit, ADRs varied between OPRM1 genotypes, with individuals w ho were AA at that A118G locus having, on average, two or more ADRs th an AG/GG patients. Nausea and other gastrointestina l ADRs followed this same pattern. COMT genotyping was similar; with AA/GG patients have more ADRs, and those that were COMT AG were less likely to have loss of libido, skin redness, v omiting, or sexual dysfunction. The OPRD-CT genotype also showed less association with sexual dysfunction and reproductiv e system disorders. The authors were surprised that the number of ADRs did not change over the course of the study, and th ey also noted that the use of antidepressants incre ased from the beginning to end of the study. Antidepressants can have simil ar ADRs to opioids; this may be a confounding varia ble. The authors found value in the PGx testing as a predictor of who may experience nausea and gastrointestinal discomfort a nd highlights the potential promising use of PGx in opioid management . Rheumatoid Arthritis The body of evidence supporting the PrismRA \u00ae test is limited. For this test to be considered pr oven and having clinical utility, additional larger and independent studies with bett er study designs are necessary. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) medications are th e first tier of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment therapy in over 90% of biologic na\u00efve patients whose disease is not contro by conventional disease modifying anti-rheumat ic drugs (DMARDs); 70% of these RA patients do not attain significant clinical improvement (Mellors et al. 2020). Scipher Medicine created PrismRA \u00ae as a molecular signature test that evaluates the l ikelihood that an RA patient may not respond to tra ditional anti-TNF therapy before treatment is initiated. Twenty-three different assessments are made by PrismRA \u00ae; the resulting biomarker panel includes 19 gene expression features, anti-cyclic c itrullinated protein (anti-CCP) and 3 clinical metric s (sex, body mass index, patient disease assessment) which stratify patients based on the likelihood of inadequate response to anti-TNF therapies.. Scipher predicts that a 40% increase in response to the first targeted DMARD could have been achieved for RA patients using Pharmacogeneti c Panel Testing Page 9 of 16 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 07/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyri ght 2023 United HealthCare Services, Inc. PrismRA \u00ae and that both responders and non-responders have a greater chance of responding to their first biolog ic/targeted treatment (Mellors et al. 2020). A Hayes Molecular Test Assessment (2022b) evaluated the clinical validity, utility and analytic validi ty of Scipher's PrismRA test, noting that the test has undergone changes in the n umber of risk categories and cutoff values for clas sification. This Hayes Assessment addresses the PrismRA test in its most c urrent form and previously published analyses of Pr ismRA which did not evaluate the most current version of the test (or i n which the version of the test could not be identi fied) were excluded from the Hayes assessment. Overall, a very low quality body of evidence was identified to support use of the Pr ismRA test. Additional studies evaluating PrismRA in larger and more diver se populations are needed. Jones et al. (2021, included in the 2022b Hayes rep ort) conducted a nonrandomized retrospective assay to assess the analytical and clinical validity of the PrismRA tes t in individuals with RA who have not responded to tumor necrosis factor- inhibitor (TNFi) therapy. A total of 174 individual samples from the NETWORK-004 clinical study were a nalyzed for clinical validity. Of these, 100 were had not undergone any targeted RA therapy and 74 had been exposed to TNFi . The test results classified samples according to non-response predic tion with a positive predictive thresholds were used: signal not detected, high, and very high. Accuracy of the test under study was found to be 95.8% for threshold concordance; high repeatability was detected (92.6%) as well as high reproducibility (1 00%). The authors concluded that PrismRA is a \"robu st assay\" that detects molecular non-response signatures in individuals wi th RA accurately and reproducibly. Limitations to t his study include lack of randomization, small population, wide confidence in tervals and inability to determine potential for se lection bias due to lack of information regarding the original NETWORK-004 stud y. To assess provider decision making and outcomes rel ated to treatment following use of the PrismRA test to inform selection of biologic and targeted synthetic disease-modifying a ntirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) in individuals with RA, a prospective cohort study was undertaken (Strand et al., 2022, i ncluded in the 2022b Hayes report). In the decision making cohort, 377 individuals met inclusion criteria and were evaluat ed according to treatment, treatment modifications and physician questionnaire responses. For the clinical outcomes cohort, 212 individuals completing a 12-week follow up visit and a subset of 85 individuals completing a 24-week follow up visit were included; clinical outcomes were evaluated be tween the subsets based on test results and b/tsDMARD choice. The res earchers report that PrismRA test results informed therapy selection in 73.5% of study participants, noting that when these test results were not incorporated into the decisi on-making process, 62% of participating providers reported that the deviation from the recommendation was due to insurance-relat ed issues. The American College of Rheumatology criteria for 50% r esponses (ACR50) at 24 weeks for individuals prescri bed medication according to PrismRA test results were 39.6%. Indiv iduals whose test results indicated non-response ha d significantly improved responses to non-TNFi therapies compared to TNFi th non-responders to TNFi therapies are not nonrespond ers to other types of RA therapy. The researchers c oncluded that incorporating PrismRA into patient care could signi ficantly improve RA treatment outcomes, however, th e study was nonrandomized and nonblinded and there was no compa rison group of impacted individuals that did not un dergo testing with the PrismRA test. There was also limited racial div ersity (79-84% of population was white) and there w ere significant differences in characteristics, such as age, between the groups . Lastly, there is potential for bias related to af filiations with the test laboratory. Longer term data is required to evaluat e persistence and treatment patterns along with dis ease burden. Mellors et al. (2020) reported on the Scipher cross cohort, cross platform study that developed the mo lecular test to predict decreased/non-response (ACR < 50) to anti-TNF therap ies in biologic-na\u00efve RA patients using the Human I nteractome model; 39 RA-associated SNPs were evaluated. Data taken fr om two cohorts collected from the CERTAIN trial (n = 58/patient discovery cohort and n = 143/training cohort) were evaluated to produce a drug biomarker panel; labora tory studies included CBC, titer and anti-citrullinated protein. A validation cohort (n = 175) was matched to the training cohort for response rate, age and gender a nd all validation patients from the CERTAIN study ha d a clinical disease activity index > 10. Results revealed that the biom arker panel identified non-responders with an 89.8% PPV and 86.8% specificity (OR 6.57%). A limitation of this study is that the researchers did not have a single platf orm or single cohort to analyze. The authors concluded that development and validation of such algorithms to predict drug non- responsiveness shows promise for advancing RA precision medicine treatme nt and for other complex autoimmune conditions wher e patients demonstrate inadequate response to therapeutics. Bergman et al. (2020) developed a decision-analytic model to examine two treatment strategies to evalu ate the clinical and economic outcomes of PrismRA for the first 12 month s following initial biologic treatment. They observ ed clinical decision- Pharmacogeneti c Panel Testing Page 10 of 16 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 07/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyri ght 2023 United HealthCare Services, Inc. making from 175 patients enrolled in the CERTAIN st udy who received anti-TNF after failing to demonstr ate response to conventional synthetic DMARD and modeled clinical d ecision-making for the same cohort using PrismRA \u00ae. In total, 69.7% of patients failed to reach goal of ACR50 in response t o anti-TNF treatment. A PrismRA \u00ae score of 11.8 was used to identify patients with a high or very high likelihood or poo r/non-response to an anti-TNF treatment. Sixty-eigh t subjects were predicted to be poor responders: 61 were correctly predicted; 7 were misclassified as they did reach ACR50. With the first treatment strategy, 70% of subjects did not reach ACR50 withi n 6 months. Subsequently, these subjects received a second-line treatment- either a second anti-TNF treatment (60%) or an rnate treatment (40%); these subjects demonstrated a 20% ACR50 response within 12 months. Subjects who reached ACR50 in the first 6 months stayed on therapy for the entire 12 months. Forty-four percent of patients in the 175-subject cohort were predicted to have achieved ACR50 within the first 1 2 months of treatment. With the second strategy using PrismRA, the 68 subj ects who were poor responders were assigned to anot her treatment therapy; 27 reached ACR50 in the first 6 months and the other 107 subjects were prescribed an anti-TNF treatment. Of 107 responders, 61 did not reach ACR50 and were given an other mechanism of action as a second-line therapy; 16/61 then achieved ACR50. Therefore, 57% of subjects from the 175-patient cohort were predicted to reach ACR50 wi thin the first 12 months of treatment. The researchers listed multipl e limitations for this study including the lack of sensitivity analysis and the assumption that health care providers will follow w ith full adherence the PrismRA test results. The au thors concluded that precision medicine and biomarker-driven treatment a re a necessary step toward advancing clinical effec tiveness and cost- saving for all medications in addition to RA patien t treatment. Johnson and Weinblatt (2018) introduced the PrismRA test for Scipher Medicine stating that it predicts non-response to all anti- TNF treatments including Humira, Enbrel and e prior to drug prescription. Scipher Medicine repo rted that preliminary performance suggests a negative predictive value (N PV) of 92% and a true negative rate (TNR) of 50%. V alidation of the predictive accuracy of PrismRA in a clinical trial is ongoing. Scipher is in communication with rheuma tologists and payers to determine optimal clinical endpoints. Once the end points are determined from the trial, PrismRA will be offered commercially as a CAP-proficient, CLIA-certified lab. PrismRA will allow more RA patients to achieve good response/re mission (ACR50) resulting in improved patient outcome and significa nt cost savings according to the authors. Other Pharmacogenetic Multi -Gene Panel Testing The evidence for use of PGx multi-gene panel testin g to guide individualized therapies for indications such as multimorbidity, polypharmacy, attention deficit/hyperactivity disor der (ADHD), psychotic disorders and for general use with medication prescription is insufficient at this time. In a 2022 systematic review, O'Shea et al. sought t o establish the efficacy of multi-gene, multi-disea se and multi-drug PGx interventions in adults with multiple morbidities a nd/or prescription polypharmacy in healthcare setti ngs and to inform enactment of PGx-guided treatments in practice. The review included 12 studies assessing multi-medicin e PGx in individuals with multiple morbidities or polypharmacy that repo rted on relevant core outcomes. Studies varied in d esign and quality; six non-comparative studies, three observational studie s and three RCTs were included. Only a narrative ana lysis was performed due to high levels of heterogeneity in the evidence reviewed, so the results can provide only a high l evel representation of the impact of PGx testing in multimorbidity and/or poly pharmacy. Ultimately, the authors concluded that du e to the lack of methodologically robust, high-quality studies with appropriate long term follow-up, no generalized con clusions regarding benefits for patients or health systems could be ma de based on this review. They assert that there is promise for individualizing therapies through PGx guidance, but further high-qu ality studies across differing patient care setting s are required to establish efficacy. For use of PGx testing to assist with medication or dose selection for individuals diagnosed with ADHD , a Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2022a) found insufficient evidence to s upport clinical utility/improved clinical outcomes. The authors suggest that future studies to evaluate PGx testing assessing ef fects on ADHD symptoms, medication side effects and other clinical outcomes are needed. A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating th e current evidence regarding impact of PGx testing on hospital admissions and whether PGx leads to changes in medication was published by David et al. in 2021. Five studies foc used on hospitalization and five studies focused on medication change were identified for evaluation. Meta-analysis found that changes in medication occurred significantly more often in the PGx test a rm in four of five studies, and all-cause hospitali zation occurred significantly less often in the PGx test arm than in treatment-as -usual (TAU) comparator. The researchers share thei r belief that these results show proof of concept for use of PGx in prescribing that may lead to patient benefit but point out the evidence gaps that exist related to introduction of PGx into health care sys tems. They feel their analysis will assist with ide ntifying areas where further Pharmacogeneti c Panel Testing Page 11 of 16 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 07/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyri ght 2023 United HealthCare Services, Inc. research is needed, including investigation of the perspectives of health care providers and patients to assist in design of patient-centric PGx-guided care. A Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2021a) addresse d the use of PGx testing to inform selection or dos ing of medication for individuals with selected mental health conditions including anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, depre ssion, schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder. Hayes conclud ed that there was lack of consistency in study resu lts and the role of PGx- guided prescribing to improve outcomes in the selec t mental health disorders detailed above remains un certain. Aranz et al. (2019) analyzed the benefits of PGx te sting of CYP variants for the purpose of adjusting c linical doses of frequently used antipsychotics. Results for patients using PGx information (PI) were compared with patients who w ere treated as usual. Two hundred and ninety patients from three hospital s in Spain with schizophrenia/schizoaffective/ delu sional disorders requiring medication were randomized for PI (PharmG + arm) or treatment as usual (PharmG-arm). Recruitm ent began when initial treatment was started or when a change in a ntipsychotic treatment was deemed necessary. One hu ndred twenty-three patients were genotyped using the commercial Brainc hip PGx test; 167 patients were treated as usual by adhering to standard clinical practices. Positive and negative scale for schizophrenia (PANSS) and UKU- side effect rating scores were gathered at the beginning and again at 12 weeks to assess effec tiveness of treatment. PANSS/UKU values were rated by clinical psychiatrists who were also blinded to the patient' s arm. No statistically significant differences wer e observed in side effects between the two groups. When patients had their dos e adjusted based on PharmG+ data (n = 123), there w as a larger reduction in side effects than those in the PharmG- group but this was not statistically significant ( p > 0.05). PharmG+ patients who were carriers of CYP2D6 UMs (ultra-metabolizer) or PMs (poor metabolizer) variants showed statistic ally larger improvements in global, psychic and other UKU side effects as compared to PharmG- (p = 0.02, p = 0.05 and p = 0.01, respectively). The authors concluded that PGx inter ventions may enhance safety by decreasing the side effects of antipsychotic treatments, however the study did not find evidence of greater efficacy. The researchers also conclude d that the results were not unexpected as treatment success may be influenc ed by more than genomic profiles and describe the e ffect of drug metabolism as a key factor. Borobia et al. (2018) reported on the implementatio n of a PGx program in 2014 at La Paz University Hos pital (LPUH) in Madrid. LPUH is a 1,308-bed tertiary-care teaching hospital of the Spanish NHS serving 600,000 people. The goal of the study was to implement PGx into clinical practice and evolve fro m an ad hoc strategy linked to a prescription to a proactive practice, where genetic information would be obtained prior to a pr escription in at risk populations. The targeted pop ulations were at risk for inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, transplant p atients, high cardiovascular disease risk, leukemia , and colorectal cancer. The authors utilized a 180 SNP panel (PharmArray) f or testing. Ordering providers would submit a recom mendation and request for testing to a centralized Pharmacogeneti c Testing Unit who would evaluate the request based on patient demographics if the requested marker fell into one of three categories. Category A was for pre-emptive screening of an actionable marker, such as HLA-B5701 for abacavir r esponse. Category B was for drugs with a well-define d protocol for treating certain diseases, such as TPMT for thiopurine respo nse in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Category C was for drugs without a well-defined protocol. In this situ ation, the PGx unit would evaluate the therapeutic issue and determine if a PGx test would be clinically useful. From January 2014 through December 2016, the Pharmacogenetic Testing Unit received 2,539 consultation requests. The most common tests were T PMT and MTHFR. There were 1,939 requests for treatm ent selection with well-defined protocols and 711 for drugs with PGx t reatment recommendations for certain diseases or wi th poorly defined recommendations. Of these, 600 were found appropria te and approved, and 32% had a molecular profile th at impacted the drug. In this sub-group, 58% (107) had a dose adjus tment as a result. The program's total cost was est imated at 216 \u20ac ($254) per patient, and 91% of physicians surveyed said th ey would now use PGx regularly. O'Donnell et al. (2014) implemented a PGx testing p rogram, The 1200 Patients Project, at the Universit y of Chicago, to adult patients who were regularly taking at least one pre scription drug, but not more than six. Patients cou ld be referred by a care provider or self-referred to the program. After par ticipating in an informed consent process, patients were tested for PGx variants using a commercially available multi-gene PGx testing panel (Sequenom ADME). Overall, 868 pat ients that completed PGx testing had 2279 patient encounters that were r eviewed. Four medical specialties and seventeen pro viders represented all clinic visits: executive health, nephrology, hepato logy, and pulmonology. aspirin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and amlodipine. Of all medications on active patient dr ug lists, 34% had associated alerts (n = 2869) that included green (21%), cautio nary yellow (13%) and high-risk red (0.5%). The rem aining medications had no actionable PGx information. Of the 2869 alerts p rovided, green alerts were viewed 40% of the time, and 4% had medication changes documented. Yellow alerts were viewed 66% o f the time, and 5% had medication changes documente d. Red alerts were viewed 89% of the time, and 24% had medication changes documented. Nearly half of all medication changes were for Pharmacogeneti c Panel Testing Page 12 of 16 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 07/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyri ght 2023 United HealthCare Services, Inc. omeprazole and atorvastatin. Simvastatin and rabepr azole had the highest overall percentage of changes influenced by the PGx test results. The authors note that limitations to this study include the small number of providers in volved and the modest response to actionable alerts, with only 60 medicat ion changes out of 405 possibly actionable red and yellow alerts. In addition, the providers included in the study were also co-in vestigators which may highlight a bias toward PGx, and they knew their behavior was being examined, which may have altered their choices from what they would have done if th ey had not known their choices were being monitored. Clinical Practice Guidelines American College of Rheumatology (ACR) In a 2021 ACR guideline (Fraenkel et al.) the Prism RA test is not specifically discussed, however the guideline does reference the following as a \"key clinical question requiring further research\": Do clinical or biologic markers predict a differential response to DMARDs? They note that the answer to th is question is an important gap in knowledge relate d to management of RA. ACR has identified eleven measures of disease activi ty for Rheumatoid Arthritis as a minimum standard f or regular use in clinical settings: Disease Activity Score (DAS), Ro utine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 5(RAPID 5), Clinical Disease Acti vity Index (CDAI), Disease Activity Score with 28 jo ints (DAS28-ESR/CP), Patient Derived DAS28, Hospital Universitario La y Score (MBDA Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity In dex (RADAI), Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index D (RADAI-5), Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI). (England et al., 2019) Singh et al. (2016) recommended that the primary go al for RA treatment should be low disease activity and/or clinical remission with a goal of ACR50 or 70 achievement. With modera te to high activity despite DMARD monotherapy, comb ination DMARD or is preferred over DMARD monotherapy. The guideline states that the use of n on-TNF biologics has been proven effective in RA treatment. Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC \u00ae) CPIC \u00ae is an international organization with membership i ncluding clinicians, scientists, laboratorians, and other PGx experts with the purpose of facilitating the use of PGx tes t results for patient care. CPIC's goal is to address the barrier caused by difficulty translating genetic laboratory test resu lts into actionable prescribing decisions for appli cable drugs by creating freely available, peer-reviewed, evidence-based, and updat able gene/drug clinical practice guidelines. CPIC sta rted as a shared project between the Pharmacogenetics Research Netwo rk (PGRN) and the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base ( PharmGKB) in 2009. CPIC guidelines are indexed in PubMed as cli nical guidelines, endorsed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) and the American Society for Clin (ASCPT), and and PharmGKB. In recent CPIC guideline, Crews et al. (2021) summ arized the evidence regarding CYP2D6, OPRM1 and COMT and their impact on opioid analgesia as well as adverse event s and provided therapeutic recommendations for CYP2D 6 genotype result usage related to prescription of codeine and tramad ol. There is substantial evidence that has linked CY P2D6 to variations in effect and toxicity of codeine and tramadol, but in sufficient evidence to support use of this ng dose requi rements for postoperative pain in some opioids, but there is in sufficient evidence to clearly demonstrate altered analgesic response to these variants. The most highly studied COMT variant is rs4680, but there is no evidence to support ass ociation of this variant with adverse effects of opioids and there is mixed evidence for association between COMT rs4680 genotyp e and dosing requirements. For all other variants of COMT, there is mixed evidence regarding association between COM T and analgesia, opioid dosing and adverse events. Overall, there is limited or weak data for use of CYP2D6 genotyping f or hydrocodone, oxycodone and methadone and for OPRM1 and COMT1 use. European Le ague Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Smolen et al. (2019) reported on updates from the E ULAR international task force which revisited 2016 policies by conducting literature searches regarding the efficacy and safe ty of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs ). Five principles and 12 recommendations were made for use of conventiona l synthetic DMARDs; glucocorticoids; biological DMA RDs; targeted (Janus JAK ki nase inhibitors). Guidance on monotherapy/combinati on therapy, Pharmacogeneti c Panel Testing Page 13 of 16 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 07/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyri ght 2023 United HealthCare Services, Inc. treatment strategies and tapering on sustained remi ssion are included in addition to cost and sequenci ng of DMARDs. First treatment is traditionally monotherapy with but poor response within 3-6 months recom mends stratification to risk factors. In the presence of reduced prognostic factors, biological DMARD or JAK inhibitor should be added to the conventional DMARD. With sustained remission, DMARD s may be lowered but not discontinued. EULAR recommends arthritis activity be assessed at 1-3-month intervals to determine treatment. \"Monito ring of disease activity should include tender and swollen joint counts, pat ient, and physician global assessments, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C reactive protein, by applying a composite measure. \" Composite measures recommended include the Diseas e Activity Score with 28 joints, Clinical Disease Activity Index, and Simplified Disease Activity Index. Evaluation of n ew biomarkers and multibiomarkers for the prognosis and treatment of early arthritis is not recommended by the group. (C ombe et al. 2017) International Society of Psychiatric Genetics (ISPG ) In 2021, a group of experts assembled by the ISPG p ublished a narrative review of PGx evidence, produc t labeling and existing prescribing guidelines for psychotropic medications and the main considerations and concerns related t o psychiatric use of PGx testing (Bousman et al., 2021). The group deter mined that current published literature, product la beling and prescribing guidelines support the use of PGx testing for CYP2D6 , and CYP2C19 to inform selection of medication and dosing of multiple common anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medicatio ns. They feel the evidence also supports additional testing for human leukocyte antigen genes with use of mood stabilizer s including carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenyt oin. Screening for variants in POLG, OTC, and CSP1 is recommended for va lproate screening when there is suspicion of a mito chondrial disorder or urea cycle disorder. Noted in this review is the fact that PGx testing is not regulated at present and there are many available tests that include genes with little or no support for clinical implementation which could lead to ina ppropriate medication selection and dosing. Large PGx studies are current ly underway, with the expectation that results will lead to further evolution of evidence supporting the use of PGx testing and remo val of barriers for appropriate testing. Overall, t he group is optimistic regarding the current direction of research and inn ovation in the field of PGx testing and believes th is testing will ultimately become an important tool for use in individuals wit h psychiatric disorders. ISPG updated their guidelines on genetic testing (I SPG, 2019). Their recommendation regarding PGx test ing is as follows: PGx testing should be viewed as a decision-support tool to assist in thoughtful implementation of good clinical care. HLA-A and HLA-B testing prior to use of carbamazepine and oxc arbazepine, is recommended in alignment with regula tory agencies and expert groups. Evidence to support widespread use o f other PGx tests at this time is still inconclusiv e, but when PGx testing results are already available, providers are encour aged to integrate this information into their medic ation selection and dosing decisions. Genetic information for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 would likely be most beneficial for individuals who have experienced an inadequate response or adverse reaction to a pre vious antidepressant or antipsychotic trial. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) NCCN guidelines for adult cancer pain include a secti on on Principles of PGx, indicating that PGx testin g may be considered before initiation or during treatment of pain when concerns of toxicity or lack of analgesic response are present or suspected.
