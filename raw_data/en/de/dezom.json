Relax, Restore & Renew Experience deep rest and rejuvenation. Cleanse & Detox Return to Radiant Health Ayurveda says there are four aspects: hitaaya and ahitayu, sukhayu and dukhayu. Or in English, what is good for the body and what is not, what makes us happy and what makes us sad. Like driving a car, once you know the rules of the road, you can get around safely. Ayurveda uses knowledge about these four aspects to help you more expertly (and enjoyably!) navigate your life. Elements of the Body Those who are born with more of the ether and air element have a vata constitution. Generally, a vata person is very thin, talkative, and often restless. [Read More](#) They typically have a lower body weight, dry skin, brittle nails, thin hair, and small, slightly sunken eyes. In terms of climate, vatas tend to prefer warm or hot weather\u2014they may have trouble tolerating the cold. They have a hard time gaining weight and so tend to be thin. When vata is balanced, one experiences more energy, enthusiasm, clarity of mind, infectious positivity, and flexibility. One is more spontaneous, creative, and affectionate. Pitta people are those who are born with hotter constitutions, containing more of the fire element. [Read More](#) A pitta person is generally active, good looking, a perfectionist, dynamic, intelligent and also short-tempered. They may have leadership qualities, a moderate build, a smart personality, a sharp nose, and their eyes will also be sharp, sometimes offset with a slight pinkish skin tint. Kapha indicates a preponderance of the water and earth elements. People with this kapha constitution are generally cool, calm, cheerful, stocky (if not overweight). [Read More](#) Ayurveda says that because a kapha person is the least bothered, happiest type of person on the planet, the best constitution is kapha\u2014they're cheerful all the time! Other qualities include thick dark hair, big eyes with very white sclera (whites), and prominent, shiny, white teeth. The skin may also be thick, moist, and a cool to the touch. As a personality type, while they tend to accumulate things, they also have a sharing streak that moves them to service for society. Ayurveda Wellness Cleanse/Detox Retreats Panchakarma can help by reversing the negative effects of daily living to restore you to a natural state of health and vitality.
