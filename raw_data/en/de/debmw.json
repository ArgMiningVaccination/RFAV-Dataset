Chief of Staff Report 2. Chief of Staff Action List pg. 1 ZSFG CHIEF OF STAFF REPORT Presented to the JCC -ZSFG on October 25, 202 2 October 2022 MEC Meeting CLINICAL SERVICE REPORT: Neurosurgery Service - Geoffrey Manley , MD, Chief The highlights of the report are as follows: 1. Goals and Scope of the Clinical Service a. Goals - They are as follow s: (1) provide 24/7 neurosurgical care to patients at ZSFG/SFHN, (2) deliver the most advanced care for patients with brain and spinal cord injury, (3) translate basic neuroscience into clinical practice, (4) train the next generation of neurotrauma clinicians and scientists, and (5) transform neurotrauma care worldwide. b. Scope of Clinical Services- These include i npatient services ( traumatic brain, spine, and other neurosurgical emergencies ; neurocritical care ; and elective/consult ) and 24/7/365 services ( attending rounds daily and sees all patients ; attending reviews all consults/studies - improve flow in ED ; comprehensive documentation with real -time monitoring - billing/DRGs ) Clinical Services o Trauma Traumatic Brain Injury - (1) from concussion to coma, (2) neurocritical care and surgical treatment, and (3) non-operative treatment Spine and Spinal Cord Injury - (1) neurocritical care and surgical treatment and (2) non- operative treatment o Non-Trauma Craniocerebral - (1) tumors, (3) vascular malformations, and (4) intra/extra -cranial ischemic disease Spinal - (1) degenerative, (2) deformity, and (3) tumors o Ambulatory - The following are the clinics: 4M Clinic - Tuesdays (2- 3 attendings, NPs, +/ - resident); not a \"resident\" clinic TBI Clinic - twice a month Concussion Clinic - once a month Spine Clinic The collaboration with other department s (Neurology, ED, Radiology, etc.) and providers has led to excellent patient care. The Neur osurger y Service deliver services that are done at the main campus hospital and services that exceed many of the community hospitals in the region. Moreover, the D epartment would like to expand some of the elective surgery for the population served at SF. Patient Population The Department serves many from the disadvantaged populations with extensive efforts to ensure provision of services needed by these people to return to work and/or family life. The Department recognizes the need to consider socio- economic factors for effectiveness of services and recovery of the patients; additional services have been employed for years to ensure their attainment. Trauma and Emergency Neurosurgery Calls The Department has utilized incredible OR rooms and worked with highly skilled OR staf f. Dr. Manley highlighted that injuries to spine and brain need to be quickly at tended to. The Trauma and Emergency Neurosurgery calls have been deemed of high intensity with 8.7K hours a year of primary calls (24/7) and 8.7K hours a year of back -up calls (24/7). \"One Service\" Model - A simple model is in place: 1 attending every week, 1 NSG resident who rotates 4 months at a time, and 1 intern at a time from a pool of 3 interns. In addition, there are back- up staff and NP support. Key statistics in 2021 are as follows: o Operations - 380 cases (19% increase since 2018) o Consults - 2,155 (37% increase) o Inpatient Service - average of 20- 25 inpatients, with 5 -7 of these in ICU o Critical Care - 2K encounters (yearly upward trend with geriatr ic population sicker than population served 20 years ago) Neurosurgery Staff - Along with Dr. Manley, there are 4 physicia ns, 1 fellow, 5 NPs. 2. Faculty and Fellows - For attending staff, there are 3.22 FTE; the estimated \"right size\" is 4.5 - 5.3 with plan of 4.7 FTE for FY 2022 . Currently, there are 72 hours of cal l per FTE a week. 3. Clinical Care and P erformance Improvement Activities The Service is the first in the nation to receive The Joint Commission Certification for Traumatic Brain Injury. The last certification was in 2020 , and there will no longer be disease -specific certifications as per notification from TJC. However, the Nati onal Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (with its Forum on TBI) is communicating with TJC to start thinking of a new certification program for TBI . The following process indicators were presented: a. TBI EtOH TBI patients were screened for EtOH versus 84% the previous year. The process was at 30% - 40% when it began. At ZSFG and around the country, at least 40% of people with TBI used alcoho l. Such needs to be addressed; as a Level 1 Trauma Center, ZSFG takes opportunities to educate. In collaboration with the Addiction Care Team, 76% of at - risk TBI patients substantially improved in FY 2021 -2022 from Alcohol Use Disorder. With the aim of reducing alcohol pg. 2 use or eliminating its use, the likelihood of return for a TBI is reduced. Such scenarios have been witnessed repeatedly over the years. b. Follow -up for GCS 13 -15 ('Mild') TBI Patients - Since 50% of them are not fully recovered by a year, these patients are no longer categorized as \"mild\" TBI cases. The Department is extensively exerting to follow up the patients. Though there is no dedicated staff as part of the research team, the current follow -up is about 47% with opportunities for improvement including better contact information in the charts. c. Efforts to Reduce CAUTI - The Department partnered with Neurology to operationalize an evidence- based urine protocol to reduce overdiagnosis of CAUTI. d. Prevention - The Department performs community outreach. An event in May 2022 included screening for strokes and increasing awareness of risk factors for strokes, along with fitting and distribution of 80 pediatric bicycle helmets. Moreover, helmets are ke pt in the offices to provide to patients when needed. e. Partnership with Nursing and Education - The goal is to promote excellence in Neuro Care. The programs include the following: NeuroPro- 8 experienced ICU RNs given mentoring and advanced clinical train ing in management of TBI Ongoing Bedside Education/support - bedside chats, debrief and healing Love Your Brain - outpatient service (yoga, meditation, and education) for TBI survivors and their caregivers NeuroTrauma Symposium - an education event for staff ZSFG and DPH (and others in the region) which will be resumed in 2023 4. Research a. Scope - The total funding amounts to $94.6M with the breakdown as follows: (1) DoD - $50.4M, (2) NIH $12.1M, (3) Private - $29.1M, and (4) Non- Profit - $3M. Furthermore, the Department works with many people around the country through Track- TBI Team. Track -TBI sta rted as a small study based at ZSFG in 2007 and evolved into an almost corporate research enterprise wherein there are multiple studies through DoD and NIH. Moreover, there is extensive translational work with private partners, specifically Abbott and othe r companies, to try to get these to the patients' bedside. b. Key Projects and Contributions - Many publications by the Department have changed the way healthcare professionals are taking care of TBI patients. Many of the work generated will be included in th e new round of ACS TQIP (American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program) best practices in the management of TBI. Blood Test for Concussions - Last year, the Department had clearance for some of blood -based biomarkers that eliminate nee d for head CT; a pilot program is being planned for clinical care at ZSFG. There is a new initiative with Abbott that received FDA clearance for the first rapid handheld blood test for concussions ; care will be changing rapidly within the next 3 years. TBI: Roadmap for Accelerating Progress - The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine established a committee to form a roadmap for accelerating progress in TBI. It was noted that a t least 4.8M people per year are seeking help for their TBI without any follow -up. The re were 8 recommendations that focus on actions for better care after saving a life ; the Department has successfully implemented these recommendations in delivering care. TBI Care Action Collaborative - A Forum on TBI was established, comprising of 40 institutes/agencies/private partners/academic participants. The Forum's goal is to execute some of the work being done. The Department will be working on the TBI Care Action Collaborative and will be hosting the 1st meeting in San Francisco in December 2022. There will be discussions on the following: (1) TBI education and discharge instructions, (2) best practices for post - acute care, and (3) demonstration project: LHCS (Lear ning Health Care System). 5. Financial Report (FY 2021- 2022) a. Revenue - Most revenues come from research and sponsored projects. b. Expenses - The affiliation agreement increased from FY20 -21 to FY 21- 22 to align with the average MGMA (Medical Group Management Association) median salary rates for Neurosurgery. The change will help in faculty retention and future recruitment. 6. Challenges - They include the following : (1) recruitment of new faculty , (2) future physical environment for neurosurgery clinical an d research team, a nd (3) resources for new clinical programs on minima lly invasive spine surgery and equipment service contracts, and (4) trauma transfers. Dr. Lisa Winston, along with other MEC members, commended and thanked Dr. Manley for his amazing work on landmark research and clinical care; training; collaboration; and dedication over 20 years. Dr. Manley is considered to be the most prominent neurotrau ma expert in the world; the protocols used for the neurotrauma care nationally and worldwide are derived from ZSFG. Moreover, Dr. Manley's leadership and incredible team were credited for the 60% reduction in TBI mortality (most recent TQIP) at ZSFG that i s one of the leaders in the country. In addition, Dr. Manley was recognized for his leadership on researching long- term outcome for a long period of time that has been deemed critical by the trauma community for inpatient care and aftercare.

CHIEF OF THE NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL JOB DESCRIPTION Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 2 I. NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL SERVICE ORGANIZATION A. SCOPE OF SERVICE The Neurosurgery Service at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center is an integral part of the Department of Neurological Surgery at The University of California, San Francisco. The Service serves a broad community of patients and their physicians through the maintenance and continuing development of capacity for the management of surgical disorders of the nervous system with a special emphasis on Neurotrauma and Neurocritical care. While problems associated with acute and severe illness and injury are addressed daily, the range of conditions treated includes chronic and degenerative diseases of the brain, spine, and peripheral nerves. Excellence in patient care is dependent on vigorous interaction with neurological, radiological and other expert ZSFG colleagues. The Rules and Regulations of the Neurosurgery Clinical Service correspond to the standards and requirements set forth in the ZSFG Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules and Regulations. Standards of professional clinical practice are those applicable to all full- and part-time faculty members of the Department of Neurological Surgery of the University of California, San Francisco. B. MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS Membership on the Medical Staff of Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center is a privilege that shall be extended only to those practitioners who are professionally competent and continually meet the qualifications, standards, and requirements set forth in ZSFG Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules and Regulations. 1. Board Eligible or Board Certified by AB NMS Neurological Surgery (may be waived at the recommendation of the Chief of Neurosurgery) 2. Current California medical licensure 3. Current DEA certification 4 CPR/ACLS/BCLS/ATLS is encouraged C. ORGANIZATION and STAFFING OF NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL SERVICE The members of the Neurosurgery Clinical Service are: Chief of Service Chief of the Clinical Service Members of the Attending Neurosurgical Staff 1. Chief of Service Responsibilities (Refer to Appendix D for job description): a. Overall direction of the clinical, administrative, teaching, and research activities of the Neurosurgery Clinical Service. b. Review and recommendation of all new appointments, request for privileges, and reappointments. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 3 c. Appointment of the remaining officers of the neurosurgery clinical service and of committee members. d. Financial affairs of the Neurosurgery Clinical Service. e. Attendance at the Medical Executive Committee, the Chiefs of Service meetings, and other meetings as called from time to time by the Executive Administrator or the Chief of Staff. f. Disciplinary actions as necessary, as set forth in the ZSFG Medical Staff and Rules and Regulations. 2. Chief of Clinical Service Responsibilities (Refer to Appendix D for job description): a. Overall direction of the clinical operations and teaching activities of the Neurosurgery Clinical Service. b. Review and recommendation of all new clinical fellow appointments. c. Coordination and attendance at the Neurosurgery Clinical Staff meeting, and other meetings as called from time to time by the Executive Administrator or the Chief of Staff. d. Disciplinary actions as necessary for clinical staff, as set forth in the ZSFG Medical Staff and Rules and Regulations. Attending Physician Responsibilities Responsibilities include: a. Overall direction of clinical care is the responsibility of the attending staff of the Neurosurgery Clinical Service. In order to discharge that responsibility, close supervision and active participation in decision- making is required. b. All neurosurgical procedures performed in the operating theater will be supervised by an attending neurosurgeon who is physically present during the case. Most procedures can be started by the Neurosurgery Chief Resident without the direct physical supervision of a Neurosurgical Attending provided he/she has previously discussed patient preoperative assessment, surgical approach, and patient positioning with the responsible Neurosurgical Attending. When the Chief Resident performs any procedure for the first time, the responsible attending must be in the room from the beginning. Particularly complex procedures or instances where the Attending and Chief Resident are unfamiliar with each other will also require attending supervision from the beginning of the case. c. Under certain conditions, it will be necessary for the Chief Resident to start a procedure prior to the physical presence of an Attending. This situation applies mainly to emergency neurosurgical procedures for trauma occurring after regular working hours. The vast majority of these procedures are straightforward and there should be no difficulty for a Chief Resident to begin these on his/her own after discussing the case Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 4 with an Attending Neurosurgeon. Nevertheless, the physical presence of an attending is required during the critical portion of the operation. d. All elective cases require that the Attending Neurosurgeon be in-house while the patient is in the operating room (OR) and he/she be physically present in the OR during the important aspects of the procedure. For some procedures, such as lumbar discectomy or stereotactic brain biopsy, the actual physical involvement of the attending neurosurgeon may be minimal. Nevertheless, direct supervision by an attending neurosurgeon who is physically in the operating theater is also required during the more important aspects of these procedures. e. The degree to which a neurosurgical attending actively participates in a surgical procedure will be in proportion to its complexity and the capabilities of the Chief Resident . As such, a greater degree of attending participation is expected for extra- or intracranial vascular surgery, complex tumor surgery or for spinal procedures involving complex instrumentation. g. Procedures performed outside the operating theater may sometimes be performed without the direct physical supervision of an Attending Neurosurgeon . provided he/she has discussed the patient preoperative assessment, imaging, and details of the procedure. These include placement of a HALO cervicothoracic orthosis, insertion of intraparenchymal or intraventricular intracranial pressure monitors, neuromonitors (brain tissue oxygen, cerebral blood flow, microdialysis), insertion of routine intravascular monitoring lines (e.g., central venous pressure lines, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure lines, arterial lines, or jugular venous saturation monitoring lines), and tapping of ventricular access (Ommaya) or ventriculoperitoneal shunt reservoirs. In addition, closure of non- complicated, post-traumatic wounds (both in the operating theater and outside) may be performed in an unsupervised fashion by the neurosurgical chief resident when performed as a service to the trauma team or emergency department.

Privileges to practice in the Neurosurgery Clinical Service will be commensurate with clinical training and documentation of an acceptable standard of clinical practice. Privileges are delineated by consensus of the active members of the Neurosurgery Clinical Service and are recommended for approval by the Chief of Neurosurgery, subject to the recommended approval of the Credentials Committee of the Medical Staff and the Governing Body. Individual privileges are subject to review and revision at an initial appointment, throughout the period of proctoring, at the time of reappointment, at the time as judged necessary by the Chief of Service, or at any time recommended by two thirds of the Service's active staff. D. TEMPORARY PRIVILEGES Temporary Privileges shall be authorized in accordance with the ZSFG Medical Staff Bylaws. IV. PROCTORING AND MONITORING A. REQUIREMENTS Monitoring (proctoring) requirements for the Neurosurgery Clinical Service shall be the responsibility of the Chief of the Service. Such requirements shall include, as a minimum, the successful management by each proctored physician of six (6) clinical cases, including surgical therapy and all pre- and post-operative care and the interval to final outcome. Assessment is based on review of all pertinent records including inpatient and outpatient documents, incorporating critical care, operative, and pathologic data. All areas of concern or uncertainty in performance assessment will be addressed by such further review of additional cases as the Chief of Service determines to be required for such assurance, and the areas of performance meeting such additional examination necessary will be discussed with the proctored physician. Additionally, continuous review of clinical cases through detailed morbidity and mortality analyses, identifying in each case the responsible attending physician, provides an ongoing process of monitoring of all Neurosurgery Service attending physicians, and includes documentation of all analyses and discussions on a regular basis. All sources of data are used in identification of problems, risks and practice trends. B. ADDITIONAL PRIVILEGES Requests for additional privileges for the Neurosurgery Clinical Service shall be in accordance with ZSFG Medical Staff Bylaws. C. REMOVAL OF PRIVILEGES Requests for removal of privileges for the Neurosurgery Clinical Service shall be in accordance with ZSFG Medical Staff Bylaws. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 7 V. EDUCATION OF MEDICAL STAFF Education is considered a prime function of the Neurosurgery Service of Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital as an academic component of the Department of Neurological Surgery of the University of California, San Francisco. It is not simply a necessary by-product of clinical activity. The process of education applies to all medical persons whether within school of postgraduate training, or board certified and beyond. Daily rounds include residents, fellows, interns (PGY-1), attending physicians, clinical nurse specialists, and students, as well as associated staff including representatives of speech pathology, physical therapy, and social services, and other participants. Discussion of each case permits involvement and input by each of these persons as various aspects are addressed. Specific examples include detailed critical care/advanced physiology discussions with Critical Care and Neuro-vascular specialists on the one hand, and discussion of efficient and effective patient placement in rehabilitation or other programs on the other. Prior to or during daily clinical rounds review of all new and otherwise pertinent radiographic data is conducted with discussion of a number of relevant clinical and scientific points. Education also includes a weekly neuroradiology conference attended by neurosurgical, neurological and radiologic faculty and housestaff members, and by medical students. Regular focused conferences include spine, trauma, and neurology/neurosurgery meetings in which topics are reviewed after preparation, often incorporating bibliographic sources. In addition, medical students meet on Wednesday and Friday mornings for organized patient-centered discussion with a designated neurosurgical attending physician from full-time to clinical faculty. The Neurosurgery Service contributes to the education of neurosurgeons, neurologists, and other specialists, including primary care physicians, through both formal and informal exchange of ideas and experience. Members of the clinical faculty are encouraged to spend day-long intervals of time with staff and housestaff on the Service, contributing to their own learning and enhancement of advanced skills in diagnosis and therapy. The ZSFG Neurosurgery faculty participates on a weekly (or more frequent) basis in UCSF Neurosurgical rounds, Neuro- radiological rounds, and research progress meetings. When possible they also participate in other special conferences including pediatric neurosurgery, vascular surgery, and neuropathology sessions. Medical students are invited to observe neurosurgical operations and participate under supervision in case management in the intensive care units, the wards and the outpatient clinic. They are actively encouraged to learn through association with physicians who do likewise. VI. NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL SERVICE HOUSESTAFF TRAINING PROGRAM AND SUPERVISION (Refer to CHN Website for Housestaff Competencies link.) The members of the housestaff participating in the activities of the ZSFG Neurosurgery Service vary somewhat in number and level of experience, but usually include two PGY-1 physicians and one intermediate level UCSF Neurosurgical resident serving as Chief Resident. All function under the continuing, daily supervision of qualified attending neurosurgeons who are ultimately responsible for all aspects of the safety and welfare of every patient. The interns referred to are usually, but not always, members of the ZSFG general or specialty surgical services' housestaff. They may be supplemented by a more senior resident from any surgical specialty. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center offers an important complex of experiences for the neurosurgical resident assigned. Through relative autonomy and progressing responsibility he or she develops diagnostic, operative, physiologic and pharmacologic, and other essential skills, especially in relation to acute, severe illness or injury. The Neurosurgery Service is mindful of the need for constant supervision of every resident during the process of rapid development of clinical competence and confidence and acts accordingly through in-person Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 8 direction of every operative procedure and every clinical case during daily, and often more frequent, focused rounds. It is the policy of the Neurosurgery Service that every patient admission, every consultation, and every significant clinical change in hospitalized patients is discussed by the neurosurgical resident with the responsible faculty neurosurgeon. A small number of procedures may be performed by a resident after attending approval. These are limited to placement of intracranial pressure monitors, advanced neuromonitors, access lines and lumbar drains, as examples. With such practical exceptions no neurosurgical procedures are conducted without the physical presence of an attending neurosurgeon. This invariable rule applies to night- time emergencies with the same force as an elective day-time operation. On alternate weekends and on some other occasions a neurosurgical resident assigned elsewhere in the UC program covers for the ZSFG chief resident. All of the same policies continue to apply. The goal of the Neurosurgery Service with respect to resident training has two objectives, each fully consistent with the other when properly organized and vigorously pursued; the safe, effective, and compassionate care of patients, and the development to the maximum extent possible of resident competence. Attending faculty shall supervise house staff in such a way that house staff assumes progressively increasing responsibility for patient care according to their level of training ability and experience. A. ROLE, RESPONSIBILITY AND PATIENT CARE ACTIVITY OF THE HOUSE STAFF 1. Role of Resident Within the Service The service consists of one Chief Resident and three interns (PGY 1). The interns shall field all primary calls regarding in-house patients and take first call for consults and emergency room admissions. In addition, the interns shall write all admission orders, transfer orders and dictate discharge and transfer summaries for the service in addition to pre-rounding on service patients and consults prior to morning rounds. Interns are expected to consult frequently with the Chief Resident with any and all patient-care issues. Furthermore, the interns are required to immediately contact the Chief resident regarding all consults and emergency room admissions. The Chief Resident shall take primary responsibility for the running of the clinical service. This includes supervision of the interns, maintenance of the surgical schedule, scheduling cases, and participating in all neurosurgical operations. The Chief Resident is expected to consult frequently with the responsible Attending with any and all patient- care issues. Furthermore, the Chief Resident shall contact the responsible attending regarding all neurosurgical consults and emergency room admissions upon completion of the initial evaluation. In addition, he/she shall discuss all surgical cases with the responsible attending prior to making the final surgical decision. 2. House Staff Supervision Supervision of the house staff shall be the responsibility of the service attending as well as the Chief of Service. The service attending shall round with the house staff on a daily basis allowing the Chief Resident to run rounds and to formulate the patient care-plan. However, the service attending has the responsibility to modify such plan as he/she may deem appropriate while discussing the change in an instructional manner. Surgical supervision shall be as stated in sections I.C.3.a-f. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 9 Progressive patient-care involvement and independence of action shall be left at the discretion of the supervising attending and the Chief of Service. B. RESIDENT EVALUATION PROCESS Informal evaluation shall be done on a daily basis with emphasis placed on house-staff and medical student instruction. Formal evaluation shall be done on a monthly basis for interns via the UCSF computerized evaluation system. The Chief Resident shall be evaluated at the end of his/her rotation (4-6 months) via the UCSF Department of Neurosurgery resident evaluation form. These are submitted to the Residency Program Director of Neurosurgery. Formal feedback to the interns is done through the UCSF Department of Surgery. Formal feedback to the Chief Resident is done through the office of the Residency Program Director of the UCSF Department of Neurosurgery. Informal feedback is done via face-to-face discussion between the Chief of Service and the Chief Resident or intern. C. PATIENT CARE ORDERS At the beginning of their rotation, all residents and interns shall be given a copy of both the Neurosurgery House Staff Manual and Guidelines for the Critical Care Management of Severe Head Injury which address guidelines for patient care, orders, and neurological and neurosurgical assessment. Proper order writing and patient care issues will be re- enforced on daily rounds and conferences. Housestaff are expected to independently write orders for step-down unit and regular ward patients under general patient-care guidelines discussed on daily rounds. All new orders or changes in patient-care plan for ICU patients must be discussed with the Chief Resident. He/she shall then discuss these with the attending prior to their implementation. VII. NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL SERVICE CONSULTATION CRITERIA The Neurosurgery Service provides consultation on both urgent and routine bases on behalf of any requesting service. Such requests frequently originate in the Emergency Department, ICU, Operating Room or other acute care sites. The importance of prompt response is recognized by a policy that requests for consultation will be answered immediately, in cases described as unstable, changing, or unclear, and as soon as practicable in all other cases, including relatively minor or stable conditions. In this sense, no consultation is considered \"routine\" or unimportant. In the case of severe or undiagnosed problems the resident immediately discusses the case with the responsible attending neurosurgeon, at any hour, and in any matter of doubt about diagnosis or therapy the attending neurosurgeon personally sees the patient immediately. The attending neurosurgeon is called for discussion and approval at some time during the consultation process in every case. The Neurosurgery Service also serves as an information resource for physicians calling from acute care facilities. VIII. DISCIPLINARY ACTION The Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules and Regulations will govern all disciplinary action involving members of the ZSFG Neurosurgery Clinical Service. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 10 IX. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PATIENT SAFETY (PIPS) AND UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT A.

Goals and Objectives A. To assure that all patients receive appropriate and timely care with respect to their diagnostic and therapy, including surgical treatment where appropriate. B. To minimize to the fullest extent possible both morbidity and mortality. C. To prevent unnecessary in-patient days. II. Responsibility The Chief of the Neurosurgery Service has the overall responsibility for the program. Initiation, implementation, and follow-up of patient care evaluation activities may be delegated to another staff member. III. Components of the Performance Improvement and Patient Safety (PIPS) A. The quality and appropriateness of care on the Neurosurgery Service area assessed by the following: 1. Morbidity and mortality review 2. Complications review including incidence of infections 3. Surgical case review without specimens 4. Housestaff evaluations 5. Chart reviews 6. Attending staff reappointment review 7. Clinical Service monthly meetings which include patient care 8. Incident reports and risk-management cases related to the clinical practice are responded to promptly since they are almost always based on complications of clinical events already documented in the minutes of the monthly Morbidity and Mortality Review. Search of the clinical records for additional details may also be necessary. This documentation is the mechanism by which adverse patterns and trends may be identified, in which case the following remedial actions are implemented: a) In-service education and training program, b) New revised policies and procedures c) Staffing changes or equipment changes IV. Reporting Evidence of all Neurosurgery Service performance improvement and patient safety activities will be maintained in the Service and reported during monthly Neurosurgery Service staff meetings. Minutes of the meetings will be forwarded to the QM office monthly. V. Correction The Chief of the Neurosurgery Service will be responsible for assuring the correction of interservice/committee patient-care issues. Assistance from the Q&UM Office will be requested when certain problems cross service/committee boundaries and/or when the Service is unable to correct the problem. VI. Peer Review Appraisal of Service and individual patterns of patient care as determined by reviews and evaluations conducted by the Neurosurgery Service, e.g., complication rates, housestaff reviews, and hospital committees/programs (e.g., Performance Improvement & Patient Safety, Infection Control), will be used by the Chief of the Service in the medical staff reappointment process and delineation of privileges. Patterns of care will be discussed during the monthly service meeting. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 17 VII. Admission Policy for Patients with Head Trauma Head-injury patients with either of the following: a. New abnormality on CT scan of the head, or b. Abnormal neurological exam not entirely attributable to intoxication or other obvious process, with negative CT Will be admitted by the Chief Resident unless a neurosurgical-attending physician who has examined the patient and reviewed the scan writes a note that discharge is safe. VIII. Service Policy: Level-One Trauma Designation The Neurosurgery Service at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital supports the American College of Surgeons trauma designation criteria and procedures and maintains its service in compliance with Level-One Trauma criteria. A housestaff member of the Neurosurgery Service is in-house 24 hours a day to respond immediately to the Emergency Clinical Service for cases involving trauma to the nervous system. A senior neurosurgical resident is immediately available from outside the hospital for additional consultation and for all cases requiring surgery. Minor cases such as wound debridement and scalp laceration repair do not require attending coverage. The Neurosurgery Service is organized separately from the Trauma Service, but coordinates its activities closely with the Trauma Service. The Neurosurgery Service participates routinely in Trauma Quality Improvement proceedings and maintains its own independent Performance Improvement and Patient Safety Program. Neurosurgery actively participates with a variety of other services at ZSFG through weekly joint conferences with Neurology and with Neuro-radiology, and monthly multidisciplinary conferences regarding trauma care at ZSFG. Faculty members of the Neurosurgery Service routinely teach principles of neuro-trauma care to other services within the Hospital.

No part of this manual may be reproduced without prior written permission of the SFHN Primary Care . 4 San Francisco Health Network Primary Care Standardized Procedures: Primary Care Registered Nurse The following Primary Care Nurses have reviewed the standardized procedure and have demonstrated competency as Registered Nurses working in SFHN Primary Care Clinics. They are authorized to practice in any SFHN Primary Care clinic under the Standardized Procedures and Protocols contained in this manual: RN Name Joseph Pace MD Date Medical Director, SFHN Primaty Care Philippa Doyle, RN Date Nurse Director, SFHN Primary Care Updated: 9/6/200 San Francisco Health Network Primary Care Standardized Procedures: Primary Care Registered Nurse Introduction The following protocols are the policies and guidelines for the care provided to patients at San Francisco Health Network (SFHN ) Primary Care (PC ) by the Registered Nurse (RN). Since it is impossible to anticipate every clinical situation or presenting ch ief complaint that may arise, it is expected that Provider of the Day (POD) consultation may be warranted. The RN will consult the POD by using their nursing clinical judgment. In general, the RN shall function within the scope of practice as specified in the State of California Nurse Practice Act. Every patient presenting to Primary Care has ongoing evaluation by a provider (MD/NP/PA) regardless of the initiation of a standardized procedure by the RN. All Standard Procedures are intended for adult patients >18 years, unless otherwise indicated. When the Standardized Procedure is initiated and any diagnostic test is ordered (blood tests, radiologic exams as listed in the procedure), the Primary Care Provider will be listed as the ordering provider. The Standardized Procedures were developed with assistance from the following: 1. Implementation of Standardized Procedures. Position Stat ement of the California Nurse Association 2. Standardized Procedure Work Sheet, State of California Board of Registered Nursing, Department of Consumer Affairs. 1 San Francisco Health Network Committee on Interdisciplinary Practice STANDARDIZED PROCEDURE Registered Nurse Management of Chronic Disease in Primary Care Title: Registered Nurse in Primary Care I. Purpose of Policy A. To expe dite patient care by initiating evidence- based interventions by Registered Nurses based on patient controlled of chronic disease. These medical staff approved procedures and protocols are intended to be a guide for RNs to initiate basic medication adjustme nts in Primary Care . II. Policy Statement A. It is the policy of Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center that all standardized procedures are developed collaboratively and approved by the Committee on Interdisciplinary Practice (CIDP) whose membership consists of Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, Regis tered Nurses, Physicians, Administrators and other Affiliated Staff and conform to all 11 steps of the standardized procedure guidelines as specified in Title 16, CCR Section 1474. B.

II. Functions to be performed The Registered Nurse, as outlined in the Nurse Practice Act, Business and Professions Code Section 2725, is authorized to implement appropriate standardized procedures or changes in treatment regimen after observing signs and symptoms of illness, reactions to treatment, general behavior, or general physical condition, and determining that these exhibit abnormal characteristics. The RN provides interdependent functions that overlap the practice of medic ine. These overlapping functions require standardized procedures. These standardized procedures include guidelines stating specific conditions requiring the RN to seek PCP or designee consultation. III. Circumstances Under Which RN May Perform Function A. Setting The Registered Nurse may perform the following standardized procedure functions in any SFHN Primary Care clinic consistent with their experience and training. 2 B. Scope of Supervision Required 1. The RN is responsible and accountable to the Primary Care Nurse Manager and PCP or provider designee. 2. Overlapping functions are to be performed in areas, which allow for a consulting Provider of the Day (POD) to be available to the RN, by phone or in person, including but not limited to the clinical area. 3. Provider consultation is to be obtained as specified in the protocols and under the following circumstances: a) Assessment of acute and episodic illness and injuries b) General evaluation of health status c) Emergency conditions requiring prompt medical intervention d) Upon request of nurse or provider e) Any patient requiring likely hospitalization 4. Every patient who presents to primary care has ongoing evaluation by a provider, regardless of the initiation of a Standardized Procedure by the RN . III. Requirements for the Registered Nurse A.

Initial: At the conclusion of the standardized procedure training the Nurse Manager and Medical Director or designated provider will assess the RN's ability to perform the standardized procedure by: i. Consecutive and concurrent review of a minimum of 65 patient cases for completeness and accurac y. The chart review must include cases where HTN medications were adjusted and cases where no adjustment was necessary. b. Annual : Nurse Manager, Medical Director or designated provider will evaluate the RN's competence through an annual performance appraisal and skills competency review along with feedback from colleagues, PCP, direct observation, and no fewer 3 than 3 chart reviews. The chart review must include cases where HTN medications were adjusted and cases where no adjustment was necessary. c. Follow -up: Areas requiring increased proficiency as determined by the initial or annual evaluation will be re -evaluated by the Nurse Manager, Medical Director, or designated provider at appropriate intervals until acceptable skill level is achieved. V. Development and Approval of Standardized Procedure A. Method of Development Standardized procedures are developed collaboratively by the registered nurses, nurse managers, physicians, and administrators and must conform to the eleven steps of the standardized procedure guidelines as specified in Title 16, CCR Section 1474. B. Approval The CIDP, Credentials, Medical Executive, Nursing Executive, and Joint Conference Committees must approve all standardized procedures prior to the implementation. C. Review Schedule The standardized procedures will be reviewed every three years by the registered nurses, nurse manager, nurse director and medical director and as practice changes. D.

Function: This protocol describes the functions, which may be performed by Registered Nurses (RNs) in managing uncomplicated hypertension in adults ages 18 and older. 2. Definitions and criteria Hypertension: Patients who have been diagnosed by a provider with hypertension defined by systolic/diastolic blood pressure levels 140/90 mmHg Provider: A physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical pharmacist 3. Blood Pressure Treatment Goal Generally: <140/90 mmHg Home blood pressure goal: <135/85 mmHg As defined by referring PCP Consult with PCP on goal for patients > 65 years old CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH RN MAY PERFORM FUNCTION: 1. Target Population May Include: Adults aged 18 and older with known hypertension At the request of the PCP regardless of if exclusion criteria below is met Exclusion Criteria: Age <45 with blood pressure >160/100 mmHg will need PCP assessment prior to nurse management to evaluate for secondary hypertension; please check in with PCP prior to management History of myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease with GFR <45, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias, pregnancy or breastfeeding Women of childbearing potential who are reasonably able to get pregnant Hypertension that is treated off of this standardized procedure (uncontrolled hypertension with 3 or more maximized medications of drug classes included in this algorithm: thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and dihydropyridine calcium channel b lockers). Patients may be taking other anti- hypertensive medications other than those listed which will not be titrated. Abnormal lab findings of sodium (Na <136 or >145), (K <3.5 or >5.1), or serum (SCr >1.3) values within the past 6 months (RN can repeat labs if last labs were >6 months ago prior to follow up with PCP or pharmacist) Active stimulant use and not ready to discontinue will need PCP consultation prior to nurse management Unstable hyperthyroidism FUNCTIONS TO BE PERFORM ED 1. Patient Education: Lifestyle modifications Physical activity: (30 minutes, >4 times per week) Weight management (goal BMI <25 kg/m2) Reducing dietary sodium (1.8- 2.4 gram sodium daily) Limiting alcohol consumption ( <1 drink for women, or <2 drinks for men per day) Low-fat, high fruit, vegetable, and whole grain diet (DASH diet) Smoking cessation Advise patients to avoid drugs that can induce/aggravate hypertension- decongestants (Sudafed), OTC diet pills, sometimes NS AIDS or non -cardioprotective doses of Aspirin 5 (i.e. taken for pain - doses of >325 mg). Self-monitoring blood pressure and documentation with the use of preferred home blood pressure monitor: Instruct patient to take 2 BP readings (1- 2 minutes apart) upon waking and another 2 BP readings at bedtime, for five to seven days during the second week following medication adjustment Educate on proper technique (refer to toolkit) Calibrate machine (have patient bring machine to clinic and compare reading on home machine to in- clinic machine) Home blood pressure goal <135/85 mmHg Women of child- bearing age: Reminder that ACE inhibitors and ARBs (e.g. Benazepril and Losartan) are contraindicated in pregnancy. Women with unexpected pregnancy on ACE inhibitors or ARBs are to discontinue it and notify their provider. Importance and techniques for medication adherence and pharmacy navigation (e.g. mediset , phone alarm, auto refills) 2. Procedure: Provider responsibilities prior to nurse management Diagnose hypertension and identify BP goal Request RN disease management visit for recheck of BP and medication titration according to protocol. RN subjective assessment Home BP machine validation, BP checking technique Side effects from medications (see Appendix A) Symptoms of end organ damage with elevated blood pressure (160- 179 systolic and/or 100-109 diastolic): headache, chest pain, blurry vision Symptoms of hypotension: dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue Adherence with medications and lifestyle modification Allergies or intolerances to blood pressure medications previously taken Pregnancy risk (use of contraception, sexual activity, etc.) RN objective asses sment In-clinic BP, repeated with accurate positioning if elevated Self-monitored blood pressure trends: Average systolic BP readings to obtain a mean systolic measure. Average diastolic BP readings to obtain a mean diastolic measure. Standing BP (remain supine for 5 minutes, then recheck BP 2- 5 minutes later) should be measured in all elderly patients ( >65 years old), any age with sitting systolic BP <110, or patients who complain of hypotension side effects (orthostatic dizziness, syncope, fatigue, weakness). If there is a 20 mmHg systolic drop or 10 mmHg diastolic drop, patient is having orthostatic hypotension. Consider fall risks and a higher blood pressure goal; consult provider and adjust medications accordingly. Serum potassium, sodium, and creatinine results done 2 weeks after initiation or dose titration of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or thiazide diuretic (see Appendix A) Assessment/Plan Blood pressure 159 systolic and/or 90- 99 diastolic Follow medication titration steps that include initiating and titrating ACE inhibitor/ARB, thiazide diuretic, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (see Appendix B) The registered nurse will order and transmit medications to the pharmacy through the EMR and send to provider for co- signature. Patient is adherent to medication regimen Labs are within normal limits Self-monitored blood pressure average is within 10 mmHg of in- clinic blood pressure reading Monitoring: See Appendix A 6 Blood pressure 160- 179 systolic and/or 100- 109 diastolic with no symptoms of end organ damage Notify Primary Care Provider or Provider of the Day Follow medication titration steps as explained above Symptomatic hypotension (dizziness) or asymptomatic with systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg Consult with provider. Refer to provider for evaluation, and do not release the patient: Blood pressure 160- 179 systolic and/or 100- 109 diastolic with symptoms of end organ damage Blood pressure > 180 systolic and/or 110 diastolic Symptomatic hypotension, asymptomatic with systolic BP <100, or orthostatic hypotension Note differences between home BP readings and in clinic BP readings If home machine is reading >10 mmHg incorrectly from in- clinic machine, patient will need to call manufacturer for new machine If home machine is reading accurately, and home BP is >135/85 mmHg, treat home BP (masked hypertension) If home machine is reading accurately, and home BP is <135/85 mmHg but in clinic BP is elevated, treat home BP (white coat hypertension) Review allergy list, screen for potential contraindications or precautions Identify barriers to medication adherence Intolerance to medication Consult provider of the day to determine if intolerance is due to a side effect, allergic reaction (rash, shortness of breath, swelling of the face), or other cause If discontinuing medication due to intolerance, document in medical record allergy list and progress note based on provider determination of cause Pregnancy Discontinue ACE inhibitor or ARB and notify PCP. Refer to OB GYN for management. Any abnormal labs (Na <136 or >145, K <3.5 or >5.1, or SCr >1.3) Consult with pharmacist or provider Patient follow up After every medication initiation or titration: Recheck BP every 2 weeks Draw and review labs as indicated in Appendix A Titrate medications per protocol (see Appendix B) If home BP machine is reading accurately, follow up can take place via telehealth Once patient has reached BP goal, patient will no longer require follow up through this protocol and will be returned back to their Primary Care Provider for continued follow up as needed. Patient to continue to check home blood pressure Refill current blood pressure medications for 1 year supply (90 days with 3 refills) If the patient achieves maximum dosage of medications used in this protocol, and still does not achieve goals of BP less than 140/90, the patient will be returned back to their Primary Care Provider for continued follow up within 4 weeks. 3.
