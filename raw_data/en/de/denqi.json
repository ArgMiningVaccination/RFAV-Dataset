T erminolog y and Context T erm Definition Ecosystem services The benefits that people obtain from ecosystem s. These include provisioning services (e.g., m angrove and estuarine habitats critical to fish stocks, forest foods, and water), regulating services (e.g., flood control), cultural services (e.g., places for recreation), and supporting services (e.g., soil formation). 3 Natur e-based solutions Actions that protect, sustainably m anage, and restore natural ecosystem s to benefit nature and people by addressing societal challenges like climate change, food and water insecurity , and environm ental degradation. 16 Current as of: February 2023 2 Climate-smart agricultur e An integrated approach to address climate change and food security challenges with three objectives: (1) sustainably increasing agricultural productivity to support equitable increases in farm incom es, food security , and development; (2) adapting and building resilience of agricultural and food security system s to clim ate change at multiple levels; and (3) mitigating climate change by increasing carbon sequestration or reducing GHG em issions associated with agriculture. 2 Landscape A socioecological system characterized by physical, environmental, economic, institutional, and cultural resources. \"Production\" landscapes are m ultifunctional and provide dif ferent goods and services to various stakeholders. Landscape-level approaches take into account the needs and objectives of m ultiple, diverse stakeholders to optimize land use and m anagem ent practices. 17 O ne Health A m ultisectoral approach that works at the local, regional, national, and global levels to im prove health outcomes by recognizing the interconnection of people, plants, anim als, and their shared environment. 2 Regenerative agricultur e An approach that seeks to m aintain or increase agricultural productivity while improving ecosystem health. Exam ples of regenerative agricultural practices include reducing tillage, decreasing use of chem ical inputs, growing cover crops, and rotating crops. 18 Regenerative grazing A livestock m anagem ent practice that involves rotating herds through m ultiple areas in short bouts of grazing interspersed with longer periods of recovery to boost regrowth of vegetation. 19 Sustainable intensification An approach that focuses on increasing agricultural productivity and incom es on the sam e am ount of land while reducing negative econom ic, environm ental, and social im pacts. 20 T enur e The bundle of formal and inform al rights and rules that determ ine how individuals, com m unities, and institutions access, use, and benefit from resources such as land, water , trees, and fisheries. For lar ge areas in Africa, Asia, and Latin Am erica, land tenure can be inform al (derived from custom ary or com munity-based system s), form al (based on and enforced by written laws and procedures), or a combination of the two. 21 T enur e security The certainty that an individual' s rights to land and other resources will be recognized by others. Sources of tenure security include legal system s, com m unity or ganizations (e.g., local farmers' or ganizations and water user associations), and governm ents. 21 Common pr operty r esour ces Natural resources. such as forests, fisheries, and forage and grazing lands. that are owned and/or m anaged collectively by com munities, countries, or societies. 22 Na t ura l R e s our ce M a na g e m e nt Suppor t s G FS S St ra t e gic O bje ct iv e s O bje ctive 1: and sustainable agr ic ultur al-led ec onom ic gr owth.
