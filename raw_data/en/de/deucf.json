The CCA Research Committee Me mbers Dr. Chris Martin (BC) - Chair Dr. Frank Mangoni (NB) Dr. Debbie Brake-Patten (NF) Dr. Deb Kopansky-Giles (ON) Dr. Grayden Bridge (AB) - Executive Committee liaison Chair's Message - Investing in people The CCA Research Committee, and the Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundatio n (CCRF) have enjoyed a very successful year to date. Our strategies of building and maintainin g pivotal relationshi ps with federal granting agencies, universities , and research organizations, clearly advances our integration into Can ada's health care system. \"Investing in people\" who will fos ter enduring c ommitments has been tremendously successful in bringing us much closer to real izing our organiz ation's mis sion. One of our many goals is the full integration of our profession and it s new knowledge into the health care delivery system in or der to ensure quality health care fo r all Canadians. There is a distinction to be drawn between Canada's health care system and Canada's health research system. To be effective, our organiz ation must provide the means to substantially increas e our ability to do rese arch in the universities , hospitals a nd affiliated institutes. We have made important gains in the health research system and these gains will lead to signifi cant benefits for the profe ssion and for Canadians as these gains impact the health ca re syste m. The chiropractic profession has an important role to play in health research and health care in Canada an d the next 5-year period will be determi native of our very future. Dr. Chris Marti n DC Chair, CCA R esearch C ommit tee You will see in this bulletin how our capacit y is increasing. Our many researchers to date, such as Dr. Greg Kawchuk DC, Ph D, Dr. Mark Erwin DC, PhD, Dr. Jean- S\u00e9bastie n Blou in DC, PhD, Dr. Jill Hay den DC and many others, have strengthened the foundation of our bridges to the universitie s such as the University of Alberta, the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia. Our relations hip with research organizations is growing as well. Dr . Allan Gotlib for example, has facilitated and helped to solidify our bridges with the Canadian Institutes for Health Res earch (CIHR) and the Cochr ane Collaboration. In the comi ng year we hope to establish th ree additional chiropractic researchers as Chairs in u niversities as part of the CCRF CI HR partnership prog ram. If realized in full, this aspect of the program potentially amount s to more than a $1.6 million investment in people . And in addition, the UQTR in Qu\u00e9bec has recently announced a newly created university-based Chiropr actic Rese arch Chair which wa s awarded to Dr. Martin Descarrea ux DC, PhD. This is very exciting news for the profession. More chiropractors are considering research as a career path. We are moving steadily forward and our research capacity is increas ing as we had hoped. Ideally we will soon have chiropractic researchers based at universities all across Canada, but \" investing in people\" is our first ste p. Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation CCRF Boa rd of Directors and Officers Dr. Rob Allaby DC (NB) - President Dr. Martin Gurvey DC (MB) Dr. Eric Jackson DC (ON) Dr. David Brunarski DC (ON) Dr. Ron Bodkin PhD ( ON) Dr. Dave Peterson DC (AB) Dr. Allan Gotlib DC (ON) President's Message: Helping the pr ofession meet its research targets Our profession's capacity to do research is growing. But we need to catalyze even faster grow th! Sound research enhances our profession's credibility. Canadians benefit when our credibility increases. University-b ased chiropractic researchers allow our chiropractic knowledge to be integrated in to the national health research and healthcare systems an d this enables us to do our part in terms o f mitigating the burdens of illness and disab ility that so many Canadians needless ly endure. Dr. Rob All aby DC Presid ent, CC RF 2 Less than 1% of our profession is actively engaged in fu lltime healt h research. CCRF add resses this inequ ity with the targeted goals of est ablish ing and facilitating the funding for a university- based Chiropractic Research Chair in each province in Canad a. By \"investing in people\", CCRF has created extraordinary opportunity for many chiropractors to pursue a career in research and obtain their PhD's and secure the training and expertise required to advance our profession. The rigorous training our chiropractors receive in the universities as part of their graduate studies, provides the basis for our profession to firmly withstand the scrutiny of the scientific community. It also provides the basis for s ound evidenc e to support what 99% of us do in clinical practice and the successes we experience with our patients everyday. Currently CCRF is fun ded by provincia l donations, Foundation me mberships, fundraisin g events and partnering with govern ment agencies. I want to sincerely thank all of the provinces for their continued s upport of the CCA/CCRF research pr ogram. Their commitmen t to our goals has ensured our continued success in meeting the cha llenges our profession face s. I also thank the many individual members of t he CCRF who annually contribute through their membership. We truly appreciate your participat ion and commitment to the CCRF. Our most valuable commodity is our researchers. It take s $500,000 to create and suppor t a university-b ased Chiro Professorship. Please support the CC RF with a donation or a member ship.

Dr. Jill Hayden has joined the group as Research Scientist. In addition to research into treatment and rehabilitation, CREIDO will addr ess return to work practices and interventions, the organization and design of work, and the interactions between injured workers and health care providers, t he workplace, and the WSIB. CREIDO's primary objective is the development and testing of interventions that will return workers with musculoskeletal pain to safe and sustainable work. 6Research Projects of Note Ongoing Stroke Study In a collaborative initiative, two leading prin cipal investigators are undertaking a population based case-crossover study and a case control st udy to answer the question - Are chiropractic services associated with an increased risk of stroke? Dr. J. David Cassidy DC, PhD, Dr Med Sc is a Pr ofessor of Epidemiology at the University of Toronto and a Senior Scientist in the Division of Outcomes and P opulation Health at the Toronto Western Hospital. Dr. Pierre C\u00f4t\u00e9 DC, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Toronto and a Scie ntist at the Institute for Work and Health. Co-investigators include Dr. Sue Bondy from the University of Toronto, Dr. Sheilah Hogg-Johnson from the Institute for Work and Health and Dr. Frank Silver (neurologist) from the University Health Network. The research team will address the limitations of two prior epidemio logical studies of the risk of stroke following neck manipulatio n (Rothwell et al 2001, Smith et al 2003) by using a design (case-crossover study) that allows for a more e fficient control of confounders. The study will also benefit form a larger sample size and clinically re levant case definitions for stroke. The study will rely on CIHI data to identify relevant strokes and determine w ho visited chiropractors. The project has undergone an Ethics Review at the Universi ty of Toronto. The Ministry of Health and Long Term Care has provided funding of approxima tely $360,000 and it is estimated that the project will take 3 years to complete. RCT back surgery Dr. Gord McMorland DC, who is affiliated with the University of Calgary Spine program (faculty of medicine, division of neuros urgery), is the principle inve stigator of a randomized trial comparing back surgery to chiropractic for LBP/ sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc. The project title is: \" Comparison of Treatment Outcomes and cost-effectiveness between chiropractic and back surgery for low back pain and sciatic a secondary to herniated lumbar disc\". It is funded by FCER. Co-investigators include PhD, R.J Hurlbert MD, PhD, S.J. du Plessis MD, and S. Casha MD, PhD. Patients presenting to the Foothills Medical Centre Spinal Neurosurgical Clinic deemed candidates for spinal decompression surgery were asked to participate in the study. The primary outcomes are low back disability, pain, direct heal th care costs and health care utilization. There are no controlled studies comparing patient outcome and treatment cost between chiropractic care and back surgery. This study is examining an important health issue but has also served to act as a working model demon strating how complementary therapi es can work in conjunction with allopathic medicine. 7Accolades Carlo Ammendolia Dr. Carlo Ammendolia recently received his PhD from the University of Toronto and has been appointed to several new positions.

Brake-Patten New Masters Recipient Memori al University of Newfoundland Debbie Brake-Patten DC, M.Ed, received her Ma sters of Education degr ee in post-secondary education from the Memorial University of Newfoundland in May 2006. The emphasis of her research focused on the chronic low back pa in sufferer and how they manage their pain conservatively outside the practitioner's office . Her research study looked at the existing exercise programs and found that while many exercise programs exis t, the average low back pain sufferer continues to have difficulty with t he simplest exercise programs. Her research determined that the need exists for the development of a pain- specific low back exercise program for the chronic low back pain sufferer.

He is an Assistant professor in the Divis ion of Orthopedic Surgery, Univer sity of Toronto, and Toronto Western Hospital. Dr. Erwin's work concerns the biology of the intervertebral disc. He has determined that soluble factors produced by notochord cells stimulate chon drocytes to produce important extra-cellular matrix molecules and proteoglycans in tegral to the health of the disc nucleus; specifically the impor tant proteoglycan aggrecan. Noto chord cells produce connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Dr. Erwin is the first to ever report the nature of the soluble factors produced by notochord cells, specifically including CTGF. Dr. Erwin has two very significant papers recently published. Erwin WM , Inman RD. Notochord cells regulate intervertebral cell proliferation. Spine 2006;31(10): and Erwin WM, Ashman K, O intervertebral disc chondrocytes. Arthritis and Rheumatism 2006 (In Press). You just have to read the entirety of both papers to understand the revolutionary impact his research will have on the future treatm ent of degenerative disc disease. Dr. Erwin recently delivered a key note lecture at the AO Spine \"Degenerative Spine Symposium\" in Montreal. His lecture was entitled \"Regenerative Medicine Applications for Degenerative Disc Disease: Pipedr eam or Reality?\" The lecture clearly created a great deal of \"buzz\" on the part of researcher s, clinicians and the medical te chnology sector who were in attendance at this lecture. The meeting was ch aired by Dr. Michael Fehlings (Professor of Neurosurgery, Krembil Chair in Neural R epair and Regeneration, McLaughlin Scholar in Molecular Medicine University of Toronto, Medical Director of the Krembil Neuroscience Center, and Head Spine and Spin al Cord Injury Program at Toronto Western Hospital, University Health Network) who was enthusiastic in his congratula tions to Dr. Erwin for the high quality of his presentation. Dr. Erwin deliver ed an outstanding invited lecture that consisted of a review of degenerative disc biology, the current state of t he art for the treatment of degenerative disc disease but more interestingly sh owcasing his exciting research into the role of notochordal cells and CTGF in disc repair and re generation. The audience inclu ded about 40 spine surgeons (neuro and orthopaedic, mainly North American audience). Erwin's work as a chiropractic researcher is generating serious discussions fo r creating a \"Disc Biology Research Group\" centered at Toronto Western Hospit al and the University of Toronto. He currently collaborates with clinicians and scientists both at the University of Toronto, Un iversity Health Network, Ohio State University, University of Western Ontario and the Austra lian Proteome Analysis Facility.

Uchasz Greg Uchacz DC, FCCSS(C), CSCS in Calgary, is the current President of the CCSS(C). Recently he and Ian Shrier and Dale Macdonald submitted a study to t he British Journal of Sports Medicine, comparing changes in jump height and running velo city with and without pre- event high velocity low amplitude manipulation (HVLA). They us ed 17 elite world class healthy athletes (age range 19-35) and a cr oss-over study design. Subjec ts appeared to perform better after HVLA for both CMJ and SPRINT (both aver age and peak results) but none of the results were statistically significant (p-values ranged fr om 0.30 to 0.61) Prelim inary findings within subgroups suggested HVLA may improve SPRINT in world class athletes (n=7: -0.05 95%CI: - 0.12, 0.02). They concluded that although the p ilot study was underpowered to detect clinically relevant differences, the direction / magni tude of the changes associated HVLA and the increased soreness following HVLA suggest it warr ants further study.

JCCA Accepted into PubMed Central On Friday September 8, 2006 the Journal of t he Canadian Chiropractic Association (JCCA) was notified that it had been accepted into the P ubMed Central database. Following an extensive two year period of review, the JCCA was delighted to receive the positive news. This represents another milestone for the profession in Canada. In the coming mont hs, the JCCA will be accessible through this very important database. PMC Overview PubMed Central is a digital arch ive of life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), developed and managed by NIH's National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in the Nati onal Library of Medicine (NLM). With PubMed Central, NLM is taking the lead in preserving and maintaining unrestric ted access to the electronic literature, just as it has done for decades with the printed biomedical literature. PubMed Central aims to fill the role of a world class library in the digital age. NLM believes that giving all users free and unrestricted access to the material in PubMed C entral is the best way to ensure the durability and utility of the archive as technology changes over time. 24Participating journals must meet certain editorial standards. The value of PubMed Central, in addition to its role as an archive, lies in w hat can be done when data from diverse sources is stored in a common format in a single repository. With PubMed Central, one can quickly search the entire body of full-text articles and locate rele vant material regardless of its source. It also makes it possible to integrate t he literature with a variety of other information resources such as sequence databases and other factual databases that are available to scientists, clinicians and everyone else interested in the life sciences. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/gquery.fcgi Upcoming Events Canadian Chiropractic Conventi on November 16-18, 2006 Vanc ouver, British Columbia www.chiroconvention.com 5th Canadian Cochrane Symposium will be held on 12-13 February 2007 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Ottawa.
