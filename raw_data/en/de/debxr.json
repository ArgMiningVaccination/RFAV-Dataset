The government has certain rights in the invention.FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention encompasses a recombinant bacterium capable of eliciting an immune response against Streptococcus pneumoniae, a vaccine comprising the bacterium, and methods of using the bacterium.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The use of attenuated bacteria that are unable to cause disease triggers a self-limited infection that leads to the stimulation of protective immunity. Attenuated Salmonella vaccines induce cellular immune responses by limited replication in the host, which mimics natural infection and results in strong and long-lasting immunity. Oral vaccination with attenuated Salmonella induces mucosal immunity and prevents infection at the portal of entry for mucosal pathogens. Avirulent strains of Salmonella can be genetically engineered to stably express, at high levels, colonization and virulence antigens from other bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal pathogens. When used for oral immunization, these live avirulent recombinant vaccine strains attach to, invade, and colonize the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and then pass to other lymphoid tissues, such as mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and spleen. In these lymphoid tissues, the live avirulent recombinant vaccine strains continue to synthesize the foreign colonization or virulence antigens. Since delivery of antigens to the gut associated lymphoid tissue stimulates a generalized secretory immune response, oral immunization with these vaccines stimulates mucosal immunity throughout the body. In addition, systemic and cellular immune responses are elicited against the foreign expressed antigens as well as against Salmonella antigens. Achieving maximal immune responses to the foreign antigen is dependent upon the amount of the foreign antigen produced by the recombinant avirulent Salmonella and also upon the inherent immunogenic properties of the foreign antigen. Although data to indicate the importance or non importance of antigen location in recombinant avirulent Salmonella is by and large lacking, there are some reasons to believe that the time of onset, magnitude and/or duration, as well as the type of immune response might be influenced by antigen localization in the recombinant avirulent Salmonella vaccine. S. pneumoniae is the world's foremost bacterial pathogen, causing high morbidity and mortality, even in regions where antibiotics are readily available. It is the single most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, and has become the most common cause of meningitis in many regions. The pneumococcus is conservatively estimated to kill 1-2 million children under the age of 5 years each year in developing countries, accounting for 20-25% of all deaths in this age group. The problem of pneumococcal disease is being further exacerbated by the rate at which this organism is acquiring drug resistance and the rapid global spread of highly resistant clones. In developed countries this necessitates use of newer, more expensive antimicrobials, but this option is not available in the developing world. Antibodies to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides can protect against fatal infection and capsule-based human vaccines have been developed. These vaccines provide serotype-specific protection, and the adult formulation contains a mixture of the 23 most common polysaccharides. However, there are over 90 distinct capsular serotypes of S. pneumoniae, and geographic differences in serotype prevalence have resulted in suboptimal protection in many countries. Moreover, this vaccine is not immunogenic in children under two years old who have the highest disease burden. A more immunogenic 7-valent protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine has recently been licensed for children that is quite effective against invasive disease and provides some protection against nasal carriage and otitis media. Unfortunately, it covers only 50-60% of pneumococcal infections in many developing countries. Alarmingly, trials of the conjugate vaccine have shown that although carriage of vaccine types was reduced, the vacated niche was promptly occupied by non-vaccine serotypes known to cause invasive disease. This \"replacement carriage\" has translated into a significant increase in cases of disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes in conjugate vaccine recipients. The remedy for this problem has been to add more capsular types to the conjugate vaccine. However, at its current cost of US$260/course the 7-valent vaccine is already too expensive for use in the developing countries. Thus, continued use of vaccines that simply alter the serotype distribution of pneumococcal disease are likely to have little long-term impact on pneumococcal disease, especially in the poorest countries where most of the disease occurs. Consequently, there is a need in the art for an effective vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One aspect of the present invention encompasses a recombinant Salmonella bacterium. The bacterium is capable of the regulated expression of at least one nucleic acid encoding a Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen. Additionally, the bacterium is capable of regulated attenuation.

The present invention provides a recombinant Salmonella bacterium wherein the bacterium is capable of both the regulated expression of at least one nucleic acid encoding a Strepococcus pneumoniae antigen and capable of regulated attenuation. The bacterium further comprises at least one mutation that affects the persistence of the bacterium, and at least one mutation that reduces fluid secretion in a host. As used herein, \"persistence\" refers to the bacterium's ability to survive (i.e. live), whether within a host or in the environment. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a recombinant bacterium possessing the genetic characteristics of 9639, 9640, 9633, or a derivative thereof. In another exemplary embodiment, a recombinant bacterium may comprise ten or more of the mutations selected from the group Additionally, the present invention provides a vaccine composition comprising a recombinant bacterium of the invention, and methods of eliciting an immune response against S. pneumonia using a bacterium of the invention. Generally speaking, a recombinant bacterium of the invention is a species or subspecies of the Salmonella genera. For instance, the recombinant bacterium may be a Salmonella enterica serovar. Non-limiting examples of suitable serovars may include S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi, S. Enteritidis, S. Choleraesius, or S. Dublin. In an exemplary embodiment, a recombinant bacterium of the invention is derived from S. Typhi. Such a bacterium may be RpoS+ or RpoS. I. Regulated Expression of at Least One Nucleic Acid Encoding a Streptococcus pneumoniae Antigen The present invention encompasses a recombinant bacterium capable of regulated expression of at least one nucleic acid sequence encoding a S. pneumoniae antigen. For instance, the bacterium may comprise a chromosomally integrated nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor and a vector. Each is discussed in more detail below. (a) Chromosomally Integrated Nucleic Acid Sequence Encoding a Repressor A recombinant bacterium of the invention that is capable of the regulated expression of at least one nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen comprises, in part, at least one chromosomally integrated nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor. Typically, the nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor is operably linked to a regulatable promoter. The nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor and/or the promoter may be modified from the wild-type nucleic acid sequence so as to optimize the expression level of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor. Methods of chromosomally integrating a nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor operably-linked to a regulatable promoter are known in the art and detailed in the examples. Generally speaking, the nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor should not be integrated into a locus that disrupts colonization of the host by the recombinant bacterium, or attenuates the bacterium. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor may be integrated into the relA nucleic acid sequence. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor may be integrated into the endA, ilvG or cysG nucleic acid sequences. Other suitable insertion sites can be readily identified by those with skill in the art. In some embodiments, at least one nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor is chromosomally integrated. In other embodiments, at least two, or at least three nucleic acid sequences encoding repressors may be chromosomally integrated into the recombinant bacterium. If there is more than one nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor, each nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor may be operably linked to a regulatable promoter, such that each promoter is regulated by the same compound or condition. Alternatively, each nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor may be operably linked to a regulatable promoter, each of which is regulated by a different compound or condition. i. Repressor As used herein, \"repressor\" refers to a biomolecule that represses transcription from one or more promoters. Generally speaking, a suitable repressor of the invention is synthesized in high enough quantities during the in vitro growth of the bacterial strain to repress the transcription of the nucleic acid encoding an antigen of interest on the vector, as detailed below, and not impede the in vitro growth of the strain. Additionally, a suitable repressor will generally be substantially stable, i.e. not subject to proteolytic breakdown. Furthermore, a suitable repressor will be diluted by about half at every cell division after expression of the repressor ceases, such as in a non-permissive environment (e.g. an animal or human host). In some embodiments, the repressor is not derived from the same species of bacteria as the recombinant bacterium. For instance, the repressor may be derived from E. coli if the recombinant bacterium is from the genus Salmonella. Alternatively, the repressor may be from a bacteriophage. Suitable repressors are known in the art, and may include, for instance, LacI of E. coli, C2 encoded by bacteriophage P22, or C1 encoded by bacteriophage . Other suitable repressors may be repressors known to regulate the expression of a regulatable nucleic acid sequence, such as nucleic acid sequences involved in the uptake and utilization of sugars. In one embodiment, the repressor is LacI. In another embodiment, the repressor is C2. In yet another embodiment, the is C1. ii. Regulatable Promoter The chromosomally integrated nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor is operably linked to a regulatable promoter. The term \"promoter\", as used herein, may mean a synthetic or naturally-derived molecule that is capable of conferring, activating or enhancing expression of a nucleic acid. A promoter may comprise one or more specific transcriptional regulatory sequences to further enhance expression and/or to alter the spatial expression and/or temporal expression of a nucleic acid. The term \"operably linked,\" as used herein, means that expression of a nucleic acid is under the control of a promoter with which it is spatially connected. A promoter may be positioned 5 (upstream) of the nucleic acid under its control. The distance between the promoter and a nucleic acid to be expressed may be approximately the same as the distance between that promoter and the native nucleic acid sequence it controls. As is known in the art, variation in this distance may be accommodated without loss of promoter function. The regulated promoter used herein generally allows transcription of the nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor while in a permissive environment (i.e. in vitro growth), but ceases transcription of the nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor while in a non-permissive environment (i.e. during growth of the bacterium in an animal or human host). For instance, the promoter may be sensitive to a physical or chemical difference between the permissive and non-permissive environment. Suitable examples of such regulatable promoters are known in the art. In some embodiments, the promoter may be responsive to the level of arabinose in the environment. Generally speaking, arabinose may be present during the in vitro growth of a bacterium, while typically absent from host tissue. In one embodiment, the promoter is derived from an araC-PBAD system. The araC-PBAD system is a tightly regulated expression system that has been shown to work as a strong promoter induced by the addition of low levels of arabinose. The araC-araBAD promoter is a bidirectional promoter controlling expression of the araBAD nucleic acid sequences in one direction, and the araC nucleic acid sequence in the other direction. For convenience, the portion of the araC-araBAD promoter that mediates expression of the araBAD nucleic acid sequences, and which is controlled by the araC nucleic acid sequence product, is referred to herein as PBAD. For use as described herein, a cassette with the araC nucleic acid sequence and the araC-araBAD promoter may be used. This cassette is referred to herein as araC-PBAD. The AraC protein is both a positive and negative regulator of PBAD. In the presence of arabinose, the AraC protein is a positive regulatory element that allows expression from PBAD. In the absence of arabinose, the AraC protein represses expression from PBAD. This can lead to a 1,200-fold difference in the level of expression from PBAD. Other enteric bacteria contain arabinose regulatory systems homologous to the araC araBAD system from E. coli. For example, there is homology at the amino acid sequence level between the E. coli and the S. TyphimuriumAraC proteins, and less homology at the DNA level. However, there is high specificity in the activity of the AraC proteins. For example, the E. coli AraC protein activates only E. coli PBAD (in the presence of arabinose) and not S. Typhimurium PBAD. Thus, an arabinose regulated promoter may be used in a recombinant bacterium that possesses a similar arabinose operon, without substantial interference between the two, if the promoter and the operon are derived from two different species of bacteria. Generally speaking, the concentration of arabinose necessary to induce expression is typically less than about 2%. In some embodiments, the concentration is less than about 1%, 0.5%, 0.2%, 0.1%, or 0.05%. In other or below, e.g. about 0.04%, 0.03%, 0.02%, or 0.01%. In an exemplary embodiment, the concentration is about 0.05%. In other embodiments, the promoter may be responsive to the level of maltose in the environment. Generally speaking, maltose may be present during the in vitro growth of a bacterium, while typically absent from host tissue. The malT nucleic acid encodes MalT, a positive regulator of four maltose-responsive promoters (PPQ, PEFG, PKBM, and PS). The combination of malT and a mal promoter creates a tightly regulated expression system that has been shown to work as a strong promoter induced by the addition of maltose. Unlike the araC-PBAD system, malT is expressed from a promoter (PT) functionally unconnected to the other mal promoters. PT is not regulated by MalT. The malEFG-malKBM promoter is a bidirectional promoter controlling expression of the malKBM nucleic acid sequences in one direction, and the malEFG nucleic acid sequences in the other direction. For convenience, the portion of the malEFG-malKBM promoter that mediates expression of the malKBM nucleic acid sequence, and which is controlled by the malT nucleic acid sequence product, is referred to herein as PKBM, and the portion of the malEFG-malKBM promoter that mediates expression of the malEFG nucleic acid sequence, and that is controlled by the malT nucleic acid sequence product, is referred to herein as PEFG. Full induction of PKBM requires the presence of the MalT binding sites of PEFG. For use in the vectors and systems described herein, a cassette with the malT nucleic acid sequence and one of the mal promoters may be used. This cassette is referred to herein as malT-Pmal. In the presence of maltose, the malT protein is a positive regulatory element that allows expression from Pmal. In still other embodiments, the promoter may be sensitive to the level of rhamnose in the environment. Analogous to the araC-PBAD system described above, the rhaRS-PrhaB activator-promoter system is tightly regulated by rhamnose. Expression from the rhamnose promoter (Prha) is induced to high levels by the addition of rhamnose, which is common in bacteria but rarely found in host tissues. The nucleic acid sequences rhaBAD are organized in one operon that is controlled by the PrhaBAD promoter. This promoter is regulated by two activators, RhaS and RhaR, and the corresponding nucleic acid sequences belong to one transcription unit that is located in the opposite direction of the rhaBAD nucleic acid sequences. If L-rhamnose is available, RhaR binds to the PrhaRS promoter and activates the production of RhaR and RhaS. RhaS together with L-rhamnose in turn binds to the PrhaBAD and the PrhaT promoter and activates the transcription of the structural nucleic acid sequences. Full induction of rhaBAD transcription also requires binding of the Crp-cAMP complex, which is a key regulator of catabolite repression. Although both L-arabinose and L-rhamnose act directly as inducers for expression of regulons for their catabolism, important differences exist in regard to the regulatory mechanisms. L-Arabinose acts as an inducer with the activator AraC in the positive control of the arabinose regulon. However, the L-rhamnose regulon is subject to a regulatory cascade; it is therefore subject to even tighter control than the araC PBAD system. L-Rhamnose acts as an inducer with the activator RhaR for synthesis of RhaS, which in turn acts as an activator in the positive control of the rhamnose regulon. In the present invention, rhamnose may be used to interact with the RhaR protein and then the RhaS protein may activate transcription of a nucleic acid sequence operably-linked to the Prha promoter. In still other embodiments, the promoter may be sensitive to the level of xylose in the environment. The xylR-PxylA system is cyclic AMP-Crp system. The XylR protein serves as a positive regulator by binding to two distinct regions of the xyl nucleic acid sequence promoters. As with the araC-PBAD system described above, the xy/R-PxylAB and/or xylR-PxylFGH regulatory systems may be used in the present invention. In these embodiments, xylR PxylAB xylose interacting with of nucleic acid sequences operably-linked to either of the two Pxyl promoters. The nucleic acid sequences of the promoters detailed herein are known in the art, and methods of operably-linking them to a chromosomally integrated nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor are known in the art and detailed in the examples. iii. Modification to Optimize Expression A nucleic acid sequence encoding a repressor and regulatable promoter detailed above, for use in the present invention, may be modified so as to optimize the expression level of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor. The optimal level of expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor may be estimated, or may be determined by experimentation (see the Examples). Such a determination should take into consideration whether the repressor acts as a monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, or higher multiple, and should also take into consideration the copy number of the vector encoding the antigen of interest, as detailed below. In an exemplary embodiment, the level of expression is optimized so that the repressor is synthesized while in the permissive environment (i.e. in vitro growth) at a level that substantially inhibits the expression of the nucleic acid encoding an antigen of interest, and is substantially not synthesized in a non-permissive environment, thereby allowing expression of the nucleic acid encoding an antigen of interest. As stated above, the level of expression may be optimized by modifying the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor and/or promoter. As used herein, \"modify\" refers to an alteration of the nucleic acid sequence of the repressor and/or promoter that results in a change in the level of transcription of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor, or that results in a change in the level of synthesis of the repressor. For instance, in one embodiment, modify may refer to altering the start codon of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor. Generally speaking, a GTG or TTG start codon, as opposed to an ATG start codon, may decrease translation efficiency ten-fold. In another embodiment, modify may refer to altering the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor. The SD sequence is a ribosomal binding site generally located 6-7 nucleotides upstream of the start codon. The SD consensus sequence is AGGAGG, and variations of the consensus sequence may alter translation efficiency. In yet another embodiment, modify may refer to altering the distance between the SD sequence and the start codon. In still another embodiment, modify may refer to altering the 35 sequence for RNA polymerase recognition. In a similar embodiment, modify may refer to altering the 10 sequence for RNA polymerase binding. In an additional embodiment, modify may refer to altering the number of nucleotides between the 35 and 10 sequences. In an alternative embodiment, modify may refer to optimizing the codons of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor to alter the level of translation of the mRNA encoding the repressor. For instance, non-A rich codons initially after the start codon of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor may not maximize translation of the mRNA encoding the repressor. Similarly, the codons of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor may be altered so as to mimic the codons from highly synthesized proteins of a particular organism. In a further embodiment, modify may refer to altering the GC content of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor to change the level of translation of the mRNA encoding the repressor. In some embodiments, more than one modification or type of modification may be performed to optimize the expression level of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor. For instance, at least one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or nine modifications, or types of modifications, may be performed to optimize the expression level of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor. By way of non-limiting example, when the repressor is LacI, then the nucleic acid sequence of LacI and the promoter may be altered so as to increase the level of LacI synthesis. In one embodiment, the start codon of the LacI repressor may be altered from GTG to ATG. In another embodiment, the SD sequence may be altered from AGGG to AGGA. In yet another embodiment, the codons of lacl may be optimized according to the codon usage for highly synthesized proteins of Salmonella. In a further embodiment, the start codon of lacl may be altered, the SD sequence may be altered, and the codons of lacl may be optimized. Methods of modifying the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor and/or the regulatable promoter are known in the art and detailed in the examples. iv. Transcription Termination Sequence In some embodiments, the chromosomally integrated nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor further comprises a transcription termination sequence. A transcription termination sequence may be included to prevent inappropriate expression of nucleic acid sequences adjacent to the chromosomally integrated nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor and regulatable promoter. (b) Vector A recombinant bacterium of the invention that is capable of the regulated expression of at least one nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen comprises, in part, a vector. The vector comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one antigen of interest operably linked to a promoter. The promoter is regulated by the chromosomally encoded repressor, such that the expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen is repressed during in vitro growth of the bacterium, but the bacterium is capable of high level synthesis of the antigen in an animal or human host. As used herein, \"vector\" refers to an autonomously replicating nucleic acid unit. The present invention can be practiced with any known type of vector, including viral, cosmid, phasmid, and plasmid vectors. The most preferred type of vector is a plasmid vector. As is well known in the art, plasmids and other vectors may possess a wide array of promoters, multiple cloning sequences, transcription terminators, etc., and vectors may be selected so as to control the level of expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen by controlling the relative copy number of the vector. In some instances in which the vector might encode a surface localized adhesin as the antigen, or an antigen capable of stimulating T-cell immunity, it may be preferable to use a vector with a low copy number such as at least two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten copies per bacterial cell. A non-limiting example of a low copy number vector may be a vector comprising the pSC101 ori. In other cases, an intermediate copy number vector might be optimal for inducing desired immune responses. For instance, an intermediate copy number vector may have at least 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 copies per bacterial cell. A non-limiting example of an intermediate copy number vector may be a vector comprising the p15A ori. In still other cases, a high copy number vector might be optimal for the induction of maximal antibody responses. A high copy number vector may have at least 31, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 copies per bacterial cell. In some embodiments, a high copy number vector may have at least 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 375, or 400 copies per bacterial cell. Non-limiting examples of high copy number vectors may include a vector comprising the pBR ori or the pUC ori. Additionally, vector copy number may be increased by selecting for mutations that increase plasmid copy number. These mutations may occur in the bacterial chromosome but are more likely to occur in the plasmid vector. Preferably, vectors used herein do not comprise antibiotic resistance markers to select for maintenance of the vector. i. Antigen As used herein, \"antigen\" refers to a biomolecule capable of eliciting an immune response against S. pneumoniae in a host. In some embodiments, an antigen may be a protein, or fragment of a protein, or a nucleic acid. In an exemplary embodiment, the antigen elicits a protective immune response. As used herein, \"protective\" means that the immune response contributes to the lessening of any symptoms associated with infection of a host with S. pneumoniae. The use of the term \"protective\" in this invention does not necessarily require that the host is completely protected from the effects of the pathogen. In preferred embodiments, an antigen of interest will be conserved across many different pneumococcal strains. For instance, PspA may be an antigen of interest because >99.9% of pneumococcal strains express pspA. Similarly, PspC (found in >95% of pneumococcal strains), PsaA, PcsB, and Ply are also highly conserved across pneumococcal strains, and therefore may also be preferred antigens of interest. Generally speaking, a conserved antigen may be found in greater than 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% of pneumococcal strains. In certain embodiments, a conserved antigen of interest may be classified into one or more families based on sequence homology. For instance, there are three families of PspA sequences based on homology. In order to induce an immune response against as many different pneumococcal strains as possible, an antigen of interest may comprise a fusion protein that combines sequences from two or more antigen families. For example, a PspA antigen may comprise a fusion protein comprising sequence from a Family 1 PspA and a Family 2 PspA. Similarly, a PspC antigen may comprise a fusion protein comprising sequence from a group 2-3 hybrid and a group 1, 6, 7, hybrid. In one embodiment, an antigen of interest may include PspA and/or PspC from Streptococcus pneumoniae. In another embodiment, the of interest may include Ply, PcsB, PsaA, and StkP. In other embodiments, the antigens of interest may be selected from any of the antigens listed in Table A. It is not necessary that the vector comprise the complete nucleic acid sequence of the antigen. It is only necessary that the antigen sequence used be capable of eliciting an immune response. The antigen may be one that was not found in that exact form in the parent organism. For example, a sequence coding for an antigen comprising 100 amino acid residues may be transferred in part into a recombinant bacterium so that a peptide comprising only 75, 65, 55, 45, 35, 25, 15, or even 10, amino acid residues is produced by the recombinant bacterium. Alternatively, if the amino acid sequence of a particular antigen or fragment thereof is known, it may be possible to chemically synthesize the nucleic acid fragment or analog thereof by means of automated nucleic acid sequence synthesizers, PCR, or the like and introduce said nucleic acid sequence into the appropriate copy number vector. In another alternative, a vector may comprise a long sequence of nucleic acid encoding several nucleic acid sequence products, one or all of which may be antigenic. In some embodiments, a vector of the invention may comprise a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one antigen, at least two antigens, at least three antigens, or more than three antigens. These antigens may be encoded by two or more open reading frames operably linked to be expressed coordinately as an operon, wherein each antigen is synthesized independently. Alternatively, the two or more antigens may be encoded by a single open reading frame such that the antigens are synthesized as a fusion protein. In certain embodiments, an antigen of the invention may comprise a B cell epitope or a T cell epitope. Alternatively, an antigen to which an immune response is desired may be expressed as a fusion to a carrier protein that contains a strong promiscuous T cell epitope and/or serves as an adjuvant and/or facilitates presentation of the antigen to enhance, in all cases, the immune response to the antigen or its component part. This can be accomplished by methods known in the art. Fusion to tetnus toxin fragment C, CT-B, LT-B and hepatitis virus B core are particularly useful for these purposes, although other epitope presentation systems are well known in the art. In further embodiments, a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen of the invention may comprise a secretion signal. In other embodiments, an antigen of the invention may be toxic to the recombinant bacterium. ii. Promoter Regulated by Repressor The vector comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one antigen operably-linked to a promoter regulated by the repressor, encoded by a chromosomally integrated nucleic acid sequence. One of skill in the art would recognize, therefore, that the selection of a repressor dictates, in part, the selection of the promoter operably-linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen of interest. For instance, if the repressor is LacI, then the promoter may be selected from the group consisting of Lacl responsive promoters, such as Ptrc, Plac, PT7lac and Ptac. If the repressor is C2, then the promoter may be selected from the group consisting of C2 responsive promoters, such as P22 promoters PL and PR. If the repressor is C1, then the promoter may be selected from the group consisting of C1 responsive promoters, such as promoters PL and PR. In each embodiment herein, the promoter regulates expression of a nucleic acid sequence encoding the antigen, such that expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen is repressed when the repressor is synthesized (i.e. during in vitro growth of the bacterium), but expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen is high when the repressor is not synthesized (i.e. in an animal or human host). Generally speaking, the concentration of the repressor will decrease with every cell division after expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor ceases. In some embodiments, the concentration of the repressor decreases enough to allow high level expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen after about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 divisions of the bacterium. In an exemplary embodiment, the concentration of the repressor decreases enough to allow high level expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen after about 5 divisions of the bacterium in an animal or human host. In certain embodiments, the promoter may comprise other regulatory elements. For instance, the promoter may comprise lacO if the repressor is LacI. This is the case with the lipoprotein promoter Plpp that is regulated by LacI since it possesses the LacI binding domain lacO. In one embodiment, the repressor is a LacI repressor and the promoter is Ptrc. iii. Expression of the Nucleic Acid Sequence Encoding an Antigen As detailed above, generally speaking the expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the antigen should be repressed when the repressor is synthesized. For instance, if the repressor is synthesized during in vitro growth of the bacterium, expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the antigen should be repressed. Expression may be \"repressed\" or \"partially repressed\" when 1% of the expression under non-repressed conditions. Thus although the level of expression under conditions of \"complete repression\" might be exceeding low, it is likely to be detectable using very sensitive methods since repression can never by absolute. Conversely, the expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the antigen should be high when the expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor is repressed. For instance, if the nucleic acid sequence encoding the repressor is not expressed during growth of the recombinant bacterium in the host, the expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the antigen should be high. As used herein, \"high level\" expression refers to expression that is strong enough to elicit an immune response to the antigen. Consequently, the copy number correlating with high level expression can and will vary depending on the antigen and the type of immune response desired. Methods of determining whether an antigen elicits an immune response such as by measuring antibody levels or antigen-dependant T cell populations or antigen-dependant cytokine levels are known in the art, and methods of measuring levels of expression of antigen encoding sequences by measuring levels of mRNA transcribed or by quantitating the level of antigen synthesis are also known in the art. For more details, see the examples. (c) Crp Cassette In some embodiments, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may also comprise a Pcrp::TT araC PBAD crp deletion-insertion mutation. Since the araC PBAD cassette is dependent both on the presence of arabinose and the binding of the Pcrp::TT araC PBAD crp deletion-insertion mutation may be included as an additional means to reduce expression of any nucleic acid sequence under the control of the PBAD promoter. This means that when the bacterium is grown in a non-permissive environment (i.e. no arabinose) both the repressor itself and the Crp protein cease to be synthesized, consequently eliminating both regulating signals for the araC PBAD regulated nucleic acid sequence. This double shut off of araC PBAD may constitute an additional safety feature ensuring the genetic stability of the desired phenotypes. Generally speaking, the activity of the Crp protein requires interaction with cAMP, but the addition of glucose, which may inhibit synthesis of cAMP, decreases the ability of the Crp protein to regulate transcription from the araC PBAD promoter. Consequently, to avoid the effect of glucose on cAMP, glucose may be substantially excluded from the growth media, or variants of crp may be isolated that synthesize a Crp protein that is not dependent on cAMP to regulate transcription from PBAD. This strategy may also be used in other systems responsive to Crp, such as the systems responsive to rhamnose and xylose described above. (d) Attenuation In each of the above embodiments, a recombinant bacterium of the invention capable of regulated expression may also be attenuated. \"Attenuated\" refers to the state of the bacterium wherein the bacterium has been weakened from its wild type fitness by some form of recombinant or physical manipulation. This includes altering the genotype of the bacterium to reduce its ability to cause disease. However, the bacterium's ability to colonize the gut (in the case of Salmonella) and induce immune responses is, preferably, not substantially compromised. In an exemplary embodiment, a recombinant bacterium may be attenuated as described in section II below. In which case, both regulated attenuation and regulated expression of an antigen encoding sequence may be dependent upon an arabinose regulatable system. Consequently, the concentration of arabinose needed for optimal expression of the regulated antigen encoding sequence may not be the same as the concentration for optimal expression of attenuation. In an exemplary embodiment, the concentration of arabinose for the optimization of both regulated attenuation and regulated expression of sequences encoding antigen will be substantially the same. Accordingly, the promoter and/or the nucleic acid sequence encoding an attenuation protein may be modified to optimize the system. Methods of modification are detailed above. Briefly, for example, the SD ribosome binding sequence may be altered, and/or the start codon may be altered from ATG to GTG for the nucleic acid sequences fur and phoPQ, so that the production levels of Fur and PhoPQ are optimal for both the regulated attenuation phenotype and the regulated expression when growing strains with a given concentration of arabinose. One of skill in the art will appreciate that other nucleic acid sequences, in addition to fur and phoPQ, may also be altered as described herein in combination with other well-known protocols. In addition, these attenuating nucleic acid sequences may be regulated by other systems using well-established protocols known to one of skill in the art. For example, they may be regulated using with promoters dependent on addition of maltose, rhamnose, or xylose rather than arabinose. Other methods of attenuation are known in the art. For instance, attenuation may be accomplished by altering (e.g., deleting) native nucleic acid sequences found in the wild type bacterium. For instance, if the bacterium is Salmonella, non-limiting examples of nucleic acid sequences which may be used for attenuation include: a pab nucleic acid sequence, a pur nucleic acid sequence, an aro nucleic acid sequence, asd, a dap nucleic acid the above nucleic acid sequences may be placed under the control of a sugar regulated promoter wherein the sugar is present during in vitro growth of the recombinant bacterium, but substantially absent within an animal or human host. The cessation in transcription of the nucleic acid sequences listed above would then result in attenuation and the inability of the recombinant bacterium to induce disease symptoms. II. Regulated Attenuation The present invention also encompasses a recombinant bacterium capable of regulated attenuation. Generally speaking, the bacterium comprises a chromosomally integrated regulatable promoter. The promoter replaces the native promoter of, and is operably linked to, at least one nucleic acid sequence encoding an attenuation protein, such that the absence of the function of the protein renders the bacterium attenuated. In some embodiments, the promoter is modified to optimize the regulated attenuation. In each of the above embodiments described herein, more than one method of attenuation may be used. For instance, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may comprise a regulatable promoter chromosomally integrated so as to replace the native promoter of, and be operably linked to, at least one nucleic acid sequence encoding an attenuation protein, such that the absence of the function of the protein renders the bacterium attenuated, and the bacterium may comprise another method of attenuation detailed in section I above. (a) Attenuation Protein Herein, \"attenuation protein\" is meant to be used in its broadest sense to encompass any protein the absence of which attenuates a bacterium. For instance, in some embodiments, an attenuation protein may be a protein that helps protect a bacterium from stresses encountered in the gastrointestinal tract or respiratory tract. Non-limiting examples may be the RpoS, PhoPQ, OmpR, Fur, and Crp proteins. In other embodiments, the protein may be a necessary component of the cell wall of the bacterium, such as the protein encoded by murA. In still other embodiments, the protein may be listed in Section I(d) above. The native promoter of at least one, two, three, four, five, or more than five attenuation proteins may be replaced by a regulatable promoter as described herein. In one embodiment, the promoter of one of the proteins selected from the group comprising RpoS, PhoPQ, OmpR, Fur, and Crp may be replaced. In another embodiment, the promoter of two, three, four or five of the proteins selected from the group comprising RpoS, PhoPQ, OmpR, Fur, and Crp may be replaced. If the promoter of more than one attenuation protein is replaced, each promoter may be replaced with a regulatable promoter, such that the expression of each attenuation protein encoding sequence is regulated by the same compound or condition. Alternatively, each promoter may be replaced with a different regulatable promoter, such that the expression of each attenuation protein encoding sequence is regulated by a different compound or condition such as by the sugars arabinose, maltose, rhamnose or xylose. (b) Regulatable Promoter The native promoter of a nucleic acid encoding an attenuation protein is replaced with a regulatable promoter operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence encoding an attenuation protein. The term \"operably linked,\" is defined above. The regulatable promoter used herein generally allows transcription of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the attenuation protein while in a permissive environment (i.e. in vitro growth), but cease transcription of the nucleic acid sequence encoding an attenuation protein while in a non-permissive environment (i.e. during growth of the bacterium in an animal or human host). For instance, the promoter may be responsive to a physical or chemical difference between the permissive and non-permissive environment. Suitable examples of such regulatable promoters are known in the art and detailed above. In some embodiments, the promoter may be responsive to the level of arabinose in the environment, as described above. In other embodiments, the promoter may be responsive to the level of maltose, rhamnose, or xylose in the environment, as described above. The promoters detailed herein are known in the art, and methods of operably linking them to a nucleic acid sequence encoding an attenuation protein are known in the art. In certain embodiments, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may comprise any of the combination thereof. (P stands for promoter and TT stands for transcription terminator). Growth of such strains in the presence of arabinose leads to transcription of the fur, phoPQ, and/or crp nucleic acid sequences, but nucleic acid sequence expression ceases in a host because there is no free arabinose. Attenuation develops as the products of the fur, phoPQ, and/or the crp nucleic acid sequences are diluted at each cell division. Strains with the Pfur and/or the PphoPQ mutations are attenuated at oral doses of 109 CFU, even in three-week old mice at weaning. Generally speaking, the concentration of arabinose necessary to induce expression is typically less than about 2%. In some embodiments, the concentration is less than about 1%, 0.5%, 0.2%, 0.1%, or 0.05%. be about 0.04%, 0.03%, 0.02%, or 0.01%. In an exemplary embodiment, the concentration is about 0.05%. Higher concentrations of arabinose or other sugars may lead to acid production during growth that may inhibit desirable cell densities. The inclusion of mutations such as araBAD or mutations that block the uptake and/or breakdown of maltose, rhamnose, or xylose, however, may prevent such acid production and enable use of higher sugar concentrations with no ill effects. When the regulatable promoter is responsive to arabinose, the onset of attenuation may be delayed by including additional mutations, such as araBAD23, which prevents use of arabinose retained in the cell cytoplasm at the time of oral immunization, and/or araE25 that enhances retention of arabinose. Thus, inclusion of these mutations may be beneficial in at least two ways: first, enabling higher culture densities, and second enabling a further delay in the display of the attenuated phenotype that may result in higher densities in effector lymphoid tissues to further enhance immunogenicity. (c) Modifications Attenuation of the recombinant bacterium may be optimized by modifying the nucleic acid sequence encoding an attenuation protein and/or promoter. Methods of modifying a promoter and/or a nucleic acid sequence encoding an attenuation protein are the same as those detailed above with respect to repressors in Section I. In some embodiments, more than one modification may be performed to optimize the attenuation of the bacterium. For instance, at least one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight or nine modifications may be performed to optimize the attenuation of the bacterium. In various exemplary embodiments of the invention, the SD sequences and/or the start codons for the fur and/or the phoPQ virulence nucleic acid sequences may be altered so that the production levels of these nucleic acid products are optimal for regulated attenuation. For instance, in Pfur77::TT araC PBAD fur, the start codon may be ATG to GTG, and in Pfur81::TT araC PBAD fur the SD sequence may be weakened as well as the start codon changed from ATG to GTG. Additionally, PphopQ173::TT araC PBAD phoPQ may have modifications to the start codon as well as the second codon, which may be changed from ATG to GTG. Similarly, PphoPQ177::TT araC PBAD phoPQ, may have a SD sequence that has been changed to the weaker AAGG sequence, a modified start codon, and a modified second codon (from ATG to GTG). In other exemplary embodiments of the invention, the SD sequences and/or start codons for the rfc virulence nucleic acid sequence may be altered so that the production levels of the nucleic acid product is optimal for regulated attenuation. For instance, nucleotides upstream from the rfc start codon may be replaced with araC PBAD and either a modified SD sequence, a modified start codon, or a combination or both. Non-limiting examples of modifcations to the rfc nucleic acid sequence may be found in Table B. In certain embodiments, a bacterium of the invention may comprise a modified fur sequence in combination with one or more modifications selected from the group consisting of a modified phoPQ sequence and a modified rfc sequence. In an exemplary embodiment, a modified fur sequence may be used in combination with a modified rfc sequence. (d) Crp Cassette In some embodiments, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may also comprise a Pcrp::TT araC PBAD crp deletion-insertion mutation, as described above. Since the araC PBAD cassette is dependent both on the presence of arabinose and the binding of the Pcrp::TT araC PBAD crp deletion-insertion mutation may be included as an additional control on the expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding an attenuation protein. Generally speaking, the activity of the Crp protein requires interaction with cAMP, but the addition of glucose, which may inhibit synthesis of cAMP, decreases the ability of the Crp protein to regulate transcription from the araC PBAD promoter. Consequently, to avoid the effect of glucose on cAMP, glucose may be substantially excluded from the growth media, or variants of crp may be isolated that synthesize a Crp protein that is not dependent on cAMP to regulate transcription from PBAD. This strategy may also be used in other systems responsive to Crp, such as the systems responsive to rhamnose and xylose described above (e) Regulated Expression In each of the above embodiments, a bacterium capable of regulated attenuation may also be capable of regulated expression of at least one nucleic acid encoding an antigen as detailed in section I above. For instance, various embodiments of the present invention may encompass a recombinant pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae species comprising deletion-insertion insertion mutations conferring regulated attenuation and regulated expression of a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen. In some embodiments, the recombinant bacterium may further comprise at least one chromosomal nucleic acid sequence containing a mutation conferring a lethal phenotype. The mutated chromosomal nucleic acid sequence may be complemented by a plasmid vector containing a functional nucleic acid sequence corresponding to the mutated chromosomal nucleic acid sequence. III. Balanced Host-Vector System In some embodiments, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may comprise one or more balanced host-vector systems. In these embodiments, the recombinant bacterium comprises at least one chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid sequence that is altered so that it is not expressed, and at least one extrachromosomal vector. Each is described in more detail below. (a) Chromosomally Encoded Essential Nucleic Acid that is Altered so That it is not Expressed A recombinant bacterium of the invention comprises at least one chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid sequence, wherein the essential nucleic acid sequence is altered so that it is not expressed. As described above, an essential nucleic acid is a native nucleic acid whose expression is necessary for cell viability or a metabolic activity essential for virulence. In some embodiments, an individual nucleic acid sequence is not essential, but the combination of one or more sequences, together, is essential. Stated another way, if the nucleic acid sequences in an essential combination are altered, so that they are not expressed, the cell is non-viable and/or avirulent. A nucleic acid sequence that encodes a protein necessary for the formation of the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall may be an essential nucleic acid. In one embodiment, an essential nucleic acid encodes a protein involved in D-alanine synthesis. For example, an essential nucleic acid may encode one or more alanine racemase proteins. In another embodiment, an essential nucleic acid may encode a protein involved in D-glutamate synthesis. In yet another embodiment, an essential nucleic acid may encode a protein involved in muramic acid synthesis. Such nucleic acid sequences are known in the art, and non-limiting examples may include asd, murA, murl, dap, alr, and dadB. In an alternative embodiment, nucleic acid sequence that encodes a protein whose metabolic activity is essential for virulence may be an essential nucleic acid. Such nucleic acid sequences are also known in the art, and or ilvE. A recombinant bacterium of the invention may comprise more than one chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid sequence that is altered so that it is not expressed. For instance, a recombinant bacterium may comprise two, three, four, five, or more than five different chromosomally encoded altered essential nucleic acid sequences. Methods of making a recombinant bacterium comprising a chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid sequence that is altered so that it is not expressed are known in the art and detailed in the examples. Non-limiting examples of suitable alterations are detailed below. i. Essential Nucleic Acid Encoding a Protein Involved in D-Alanine Synthesis In one embodiment, an essential nucleic acid may encode a protein involved in D-alanine synthesis, since D-alanine is a required constituent of the peptidoglycan layer of a bacterial cell wall. Gram-positive bacteria comprise only one alanine racemase, an enzyme necessary for D-alanine synthesis. Consequently, if the essential nucleic acid sequence encoding the Gram-positive alanine racemase is altered so that it is not expressed, the bacterium is non-viable. Gram-negative bacteria, however, comprise two alanine racemases. Consequently, it is the combination of both sequences that is essential, and the nucleic acid sequences encoding both alanine racemases need to be altered so that both sequences are not expressed. Suitable alterations may include deletion of the nucleic acid sequence encoding an alanine racemase. For instance, the combination of the deletions alr and dadB will alter the essential combination such that neither racemase is expressed. Advantageously, an extrachromosomal vector need only encode one racemase to restore viability and/or virulence to the Gram-negative bacterium. ii. Essential Nucleic Acid Encoding a Protein Involved in Muramic Acid Synthesis In another embodiment, an essential nucleic acid may encode a protein involved in muramic acid synthesis, as muramic acid is another required constituent of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. For example, an essential nucleic acid may be murA. It is not possible to alter murA by deletion, however, because a murA mutation is lethal and can not be isolated. This is because the missing nutrient required for viability is a phosphorylated muramic acid that cannot be exogenously supplied because enteric bacteria cannot internalize it. Consequently, the murA nucleic acid sequence may be altered to make expression of murA dependent on a nutrient (e.g., arabinose) that can be supplied during the growth of the bacterium. For example, the alteration may comprise a PmurA::TT araC PBAD murA deletion-insertion mutation. During in vitro growth of the bacterium, this type of mutation makes synthesis of muramic acid dependent on the presence of arabinose in the growth medium. During growth of the bacterium in a host, however, arabinose is absent. Consequently, the bacterium is non-viable and/or avirulent in a host unless the bacterium further comprises at least one extrachromosomal vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence, that when expressed, substantially functions as murA. Recombinant bacteria with a PmurA::TT araC PBAD murA deletion-insertion mutation grown in the presence of arabinose exhibit effective colonization of effector lymphoid tissues after oral vaccination prior to cell death due to cell wall-less lysing. iii. Essential Protein Involved in D-Glutamate Synthesis In yet another embodiment, an essential nucleic acid may encode a glutamate racemase, an enzyme essential for the synthesis of D-glutamic acid, which is another required constituent of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. An essential nucleic acid encoding a glutamate racemase may be altered by deletion. For instance, the mutation murl alters the nucleic acid sequence so that it is not expressed. iv. Essential Protein Involved in DAP Synthesis In still another embodiment, an essential nucleic acid may encode a protein involved in the synthesis of diaminopimelic acid (DAP). Various nucleic acid sequences are involved in including dapA, dapB, dapC, dapD, dapE, dapF, and asd. Methods of altering an essential nucleic acid encoding a protein involved in the synthesis of DAP are known in the art. For instance, one of skill in the art may use the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6,872,547, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, for alterations that abolish DAP synthesis. In one example, the essential nucleic acid asdA may be altered by a asdA mutation, so that asdA is not expressed. This eliminates the bacterium's ability to produce -aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme essential for the synthesis of DAP. v. More Than one Chromosomally Encoded Essential Nucleic Acid That is Altered In exemplary embodiments of the invention, a recombinant bacterium may comprise more than one chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid sequence that is altered so that it is not expressed and at least one extrachromosomal vector. For instance, in one embodiment, a recombinant bacterium may comprise a first chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid that is altered so that the first essential nucleic acid is not expressed, a second chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid that is altered so that the second essential nucleic acid is not expressed, a first extrachromosomal vector, the vector comprising a nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid sequence, that when expressed, substantially functions as the first essential nucleic acid sequence, and a second extrachromosomal vector, the vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence, that when expressed, substantially functions as the second essential nucleic acid sequence. In another embodiment, a recombinant bacterium may comprise a first chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid that is altered so that the first essential nucleic acid is not expressed, a second chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid that is altered so that the second essential nucleic acid is not expressed, a third chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid that is altered so that the third essential nucleic acid is not expressed, a first extrachromosomal vector, the vector comprising a nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid sequence, that when expressed, substantially functions as the first essential nucleic acid sequence, a second extrachromosomal vector, the vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence, that when expressed, substantially functions as the second essential nucleic acid sequence, and a third extrachromosomal vector, the vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence, that when expressed, substantially functions as the third essential nucleic acid sequence. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant bacterium may comprise a first chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid that is altered so that the first essential nucleic acid is not expressed, a second chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid that is altered so that the second essential nucleic acid is not expressed, a third chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid that is altered so that the third essential nucleic acid is not expressed, a fourth chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid that is altered so that the fourth essential nucleic acid is not expressed, a first extrachromosomal vector, the vector comprising a nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid sequence, that when expressed, substantially functions as the first essential nucleic acid sequence, a second extrachromosomal vector, the vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence, that when expressed, substantially functions as the second essential nucleic acid sequence, a third extrachromosomal vector, the vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence, that when expressed, substantially functions as the third essential nucleic acid sequence, and a fourth extrachromosomal vector, the vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence, that when expressed, substantially functions as the fourth essential nucleic acid sequence. In other embodiments, a recombinant bacterium may comprise more than four chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid sequences that are each altered so that they are not expressed, and more than four corresponding extrachromosomal vectors. In each of the above embodiments, the extrachromosomal vectors may further comprise a nucleic acid sequence encoding one or more antigens, as detailed below. By way of non-limiting example, suitable alterations in essential nucleic acid sequences may include an alteration selected from the group consisting of asdA, any dap mutation, a dadB mutation with a alr a aroC mutation, a aroD mutation, a ilvC mutation, and a ilvE mutation. For instance, a bacterium may comprise two, three, four, five, or more than five alterations in an essential nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of asdA, any dap mutation, a dadB mutation with a alr a aroC mutation, a aroD mutation, a ilvC mutation, and a ilvE mutation. (b) Extrachromosomal Vector A recombinant bacterium of the invention also comprises an extrachromosomal vector. The vector comprises a nucleic acid sequence that when expressed, substantially functions as the chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid that is not expressed. Furthermore, the vector typically also comprises a nucleic acid sequence that encodes at least one antigen. As used herein, \"vector\" refers to an autonomously replicating nucleic acid unit. The present invention may be practiced with any known type of vector, including viral, cosmid, phasmid, and plasmid vectors. The most preferred type of vector is a plasmid vector. The term \"extrachromosomal,\" as used herein, refers to the fact that the vector is not contained within the bacterium's chromosomal DNA. The vector may comprise some sequences that are identical or similar to chromosomal sequences of the bacterium, however, the vectors used herein do not integrate with chromosomal sequences of the bacterium. As is well known in the art, plasmids and other vectors may possess a wide array of promoters, multiple cloning sequences, transcription terminators, etc., and vectors may vary in copy number per bacterium. Selection of a vector may depend, in part, on the desired level of expression of the nucleic acid sequence substantially functioning as the essential nucleic acid. Additionally, the selection of a vector may depend, in part, on the level of expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoding a S. pneumoniae antigen of interest necessary to elicit an immune response. For instance, in embodiments where the vector might encode a surface localized adhesin as the antigen, or an antigen capable of stimulating T-cell immunity, it may be preferable to use a vector with a low copy number such as at least two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten copies per bacterial cell. A non-limiting example of a low copy number vector may be a vector comprising the pSC101 ori. In other cases, an intermediate copy number vector may be optimal for inducing desired immune responses. For instance, an intermediate copy number vector may have at least 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 copies per bacterial cell. A non-limiting example of an intermediate copy number vector may be a vector comprising the p15A ori. In still other cases, a high copy number vector may be optimal for the induction of maximal antibody responses. A high copy number vector may have at least 31, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 copies per bacterial cell. In some embodiments, a high copy number vector may have at least 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 375, or 400 copies per bacterial cell. Non-limiting examples of high copy number vectors may include a vector comprising the pBR ori or the pUC ori. Additionally, vector copy number may be increased by selecting for mutations that increase plasmid copy number. These mutations may occur in the bacterial chromosome but are more likely to occur in the vector. Vectors of the invention generally possess a multiple cloning site for insertion of a nucleic acid sequence that may be operably-linked to the promoter sequence and generally posses a transcription terminator (TT) sequence after a coding region. Preferably, vectors used herein do not comprise antibiotic resistance markers to select for maintenance of the vector. i. Nucleic Acid that Substantially Functions as an Essential Nucleic Acid An extrachromosomal vector of the invention comprises a nucleic acid, that when expressed, substantially functions as the essential nucleic acid that was chromosomally altered so that it is not expressed. The phrase \"substantially functions,\" as used herein, means that the expression of the nucleic acid sequence encoded by the vector restores viability and/or virulence to the recombinant bacterium comprising a chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid sequence that was altered so that it was not expressed. The nucleic acid, that when expressed, substantially functions as the essential nucleic acid that was chromosomally altered, may, in some embodiments, be derived from the same strain of bacteria as the essential nucleic acid. In other embodiments, the nucleic acid, that when expressed, substantially functions as the essential nucleic acid that was chromosomally altered, may be derived from a different strain of bacteria as the essential nucleic acid. As described above, if the chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid that is not expressed encodes a protein nucleic acid sequence encoded by the extrachromosomal vector will substantially function as a nucleic acid An extrachromosomal vector of the invention vector may also comprise a promoter operably-linked to the nucleic acid sequence that substantially replaces the function of an essential nucleic acid sequence. This may depend, however, on the copy number of the vector. For instance, if the vector is a high copy number vector, the nucleic acid sequence that substantially replaces the function of an essential nucleic acid may not be operably-linked to a promoter but may instead only comprise a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence. Alternatively, if the vector is a low copy number vector, the nucleic acid sequence that substantially replaces the function of an essential nucleic acid may be operably-linked to a promoter. Such a promoter may be a weak promoter, a strong promoter, a regulated promoter or a constitutive promoter, depending, in part, on the desired level of expression of the sequence that substantially replaces the function of an essential nucleic acid sequence. The \"desired level,\" as used herein, is at least the level necessary to render the bacterium viable and/or virulent. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence encoded by the extrachromosomal vector may be modified to alter the level of transcription of the nucleic acid. For instance, such alterations may include modifying the SD sequence and or the sequence of the start codon. ii. Nucleic Acid Sequence Encoding at Least One Antigen A balanced host-vector system typically comprises an antigen. Suitable antigens are defined in section I(b)i. In an exemplary embodiment, the antigen elicits a protective immune response. iii. Antigen Delivery System In addition, the vectors may be designed for various types of antigen delivery systems. The system that is selected will depend, in part, on the immune response desired. For example, if an antibody response is desired, then a Type II secretion system may be used. Examples of Type II secretion systems are well-known in the art, for instance, the -lactamase secretion system may be used. The use of a Type II secretion system with the signal sequence located at the N-terminus is useful for secretion of many antigens while a Type II secretion system that combines a signal sequence located at the N-terminus with a segment of the C-terminus portion of -lactamase often improves secretion of the antigen encoded by the nucleic acid sequence between the N-terminus segment and the C-terminus segment. This may in turn improve the immune response to the antigen. Alternatively, if a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response is desired, then a Type III secretion system may be used. Type III secretion systems are known in the art. This type of antigen delivery system delivers the antigen to the cytoplasm of cells in the host to enhance induction of CTL responses. Yet another type of antigen delivery strategy that may be used is regulated delayed lysis of a bacterium in vivo to release protein antigen(s) and/or viral proteins. The viral proteins may include viral core particles with or without epitope fusion. Regulated antigen delivery systems are known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,780,405, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. (c) Inhibiting Recombination Although extrachromosomal vectors, such as plasmids, may be designed with unique nucleotide sequences, there is some potential for vector-vector recombination to occur that might lead to deletion of and/or alterations in one or more nucleic acid sequences encoding an antigen of interest. This could potentially expose a host to unintended antigens. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may be deficient in one or more of the enzymes that catalyzes recombination between extrachromosomal vectors. If a bacterium comprises only a single extrachromosomal vector, then such mutations are not necessary. If two or more extrachromosomal vectors are used, however, then the recombinant bacterium may be modified so that one or more recombination enzymes known to catalyze vector-vector recombination are rendered non-functional. In certain embodiments, the recombination enzymes do not participate in recombinations involving chromosomal nucleic acid sequences. For instance, the recombinant bacterium may comprise a recF mutation. This mutation does not alter the virulence attributes of the recombinant bacterium, nor its ability to effectively colonize effector lymphoid tissues after immunization of a host. One of skill in the art will appreciate that other recombination enzymes known to catalyze vector-vector recombination but not to participate in recombinations involving chromosomal nucleic acid sequences may be targeted for deletion or mutation in addition to RecF. Alternatively, the recombinant bacterium may be modified by introducing a recA mutation that prevents all recombination, whether between vectors or chromosomal nucleic acid sequences. A recombinant bacterium with a recA mutation is also attenuated. A recA mutation, however, may diminish a bacterium's ability to colonize effector lymphoid tissues after oral or intranasal immunization. To counter this, a recombinant bacterium may be constructed with a PrecA:: araC PBAD recA insertion-deletion mutation so that expression of the RecA recombination enzyme is dependent on the presence of arabinose in the growth medium. In this system, the recombinant bacterium with the PrecA:: araC PBAD recA mutation is grown in medium devoid of arabinose to preclude vector-vector recombination. Then, just prior to administration of the recombinant bacterium to a host, arabinose may be supplied to enable expression of the nucleic acid encoding the RecA enzyme. This allows the recombinant bacterium to efficiently colonize effector lymphoid tissues. However, since there is no arabinose present in animal or human host tissues, the RecA enzyme will be depleted by cell division and the absence of recombination in vivo can be restored. Such a strategy may be used in addition to, or in place of, using a recF mutation. IV. Additional Mutations In some embodiments, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may comprise additional mutations. Suitable mutations are described in more detail below and in the examples. (a) Mutations That Reduce Fluid Secretion In some embodiments, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may be modified so as to reduce fluid secretion in the host. For instance, the bacterium may comprise a mutation in sopB. By way of non-limiting example, the mutation may be a sopB1925 mutation. Alternatively, the bacterium may comprise a mutation in msb. By way of non-limiting example, the mutation may be a msbB48 mutation. In yet another alternative, the bacterium may comprise a mutation in pagP. By way of non-limiting example, the mutation may be a pagP81::Plpp IpxE mutation. For more details, see the Examples. (b) Biological Containment Under certain embodiments, a live recombinant bacterium may possess the potential to survive and multiply if excreted from a host. This leads to the possibility that individuals not electing to be immunized may be exposed to the recombinant bacterium. Consequently, in certain embodiments, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may comprise one or more mutations that decrease, if not preclude, the ability of Salmonella vaccines to persist in the GI tract of animals. In another embodiment, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may comprise one or more of the (gmd fcl)-26 or (wcaL-wza)-7, agfBAC811 or (PagfDagfG)-4, bcsABZC2118 synthesis of colanic acid, thin aggregative fimbriae (i.e., curli), cellulose and extracellular polysaccharide, respectively, all of which contribute to biofilm formation. An expansion of the agfBAC811 mutation may be made to (agfC-agfG)-999, which would remove not only the curli structural subunits but also the curli export machinery and agfD ( A further anticipated benefit such mutations is the further stripping from the vaccine strain cell surface of macromolecules that might mask immunological surveillance of surface localized LPS core and cross reactive outer membrane antigens. Thus possibly allowing enhancement of levels of induced immune responses to expressed antigens. Indeed, vaccine strains with the (wcaM-wza)-8 mutation synthesize five to ten percent more protective antigen and induce similarly higher antibody titers to this antigen. In exemplary embodiments, a recombinant bacterium comprising a biological containment mutation is not adversely effected in their virulence or the ability to colonize mice. (c) Regulated Lysis In some embodiments, a recombinant bacterium may comprise a method of regulated delayed lysis in vivo that prevents bacterial persistence in vivo and survival if excreted. Non-limiting examples of suitable mutations may include: (gmd-fcl)-26 that precludes synthesis of colanic acid that can protect cells undergoing cell wall-less death from lysing completely and agfBAC811 that blocks synthesis of thin aggregative fimbriae (curli) that are critical for biofilm formation to enable persistent colonization on bile stones in the gall bladder, asdA27::TT araC PBAD c2 insertion-deletion mutation to impose DAP and PmurA12::TT araC PBAD murA insertion-deletion mutation blocking synthesis of the peptidoglycan constituent muramic acid. The latter two mutations are typically complemented by a regulated delayed lysis plasmid vector such as pYA3681 that has an arabinose-dependent expression of asdA and murA genes. A recombinant bacterium comprising such mutations grows normally in the presence of arabinose. In vivo, however, the bacterium ceases to express any nucleic acids encoding the AsdA and MurA enzymes, such that synthesis of the peptidoglycan cell wall layer ceases, ultimately resulting in the lysis of the bacterium. This lysis may result in the release of a bolus of antigen specific for an enteric pathogen, thereby serving as a means to enhance induction of immunity against that enteric pathogen while conferring biological containment. (d) Modified Lipid A A recombinant bacterium of the invention may also comprise a modified lipid A. Such modifications typically reduce the toxicity of lipid A. If a recombinant bacterium of the invention undergoes lysis in vivo, it may be advantageous to the host to reduce the toxicity of the lipid A released from the lysed bacterium. Suitable mutations that modify lipid A may include mutations in the acyltransferase PagP and/or the deacylases, PagL and LpxR. may include pagP8, pagP81::Plpp IpxE, pagL7, IpxR9 or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, a recombinant bacterium comprises the mutation pagP81::Plpp IpxE. (e) Flagellin Mutations In various embodiments, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may comprise flagellin mutations. By way of non-limiting example, a bacterium may comprise a mutation in fljB or fliC. For instance, a bacterium may comprise a fliC181, fliC241, fliC2426, or fljB217 mutation. In one embodiment, a bacterium of the invention may comprise a fliC181 mutation. (f) Vi Antigen Mutations In some embodiments, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may comprise a mutation that alters the synthesis of the Vi antigen. For instance, a bacterium may comprise a tvi mutation. To inactivate the expression of the S. Typhi-specific Vi capsular antigen, the genes tviA to tviE (tviABCDE10) were deleted. However, tviA encodes a regulatory protein that plays a role in coordinating expression of Vi antigen, and a number of genes required for host invasion (Houng et al., 1992 J. Bacterio 174:5910; Pickard et al., al., 1998 Mol Microbiol 29:835; Winter et al., 2008 Cell Microbiol 10:247). These include genes encoding flagella and T3SS-1, whose expression in S. Typhi is reduced by a TviA-mediated repression of the master regulator FIhDC (Winter et al., 2009 Mol Microbiol 74:175). The total numbers of genes regulated, directly or indirectly, by TviA remain unknown. Thus, a modification of the complete Vi antigen deletion, tviABCDE10, may be made which leaves tviA intact in the chromosome (tviBCDE29) ( (g) Mutations Which Alter the Expression of Heterologous Antigen In some embodiments, the relA198::araC PBAD lacl TT mutation may result in in vivo expression of heterologous antigen in inappropriate tissues or may delay expression past the optimal immunologic window. This mutation may be replaced with the PBAD lacl TT, relA197::araC PBAD lacl TT or relA1123 mutations in order to facilitate more rapid antigen expression. The relA196::araC PBAD lacl TT mutation contains a weak Shine-Dalgarno sequence and a suboptimal translation start codon (GTG) for lacl, which results in low levels of LacI synthesis and more rapid deregulation of antigen in vivo. The relA197::araC PBAD lacl TT mutation contains and translation start codons (ATG) for lacl, which results in moderate levels of LacI synthesis and deregulation of antigen in vivo at an intermediate rate. In some instances, lacl regulation may not be desired at all, but the removal of the stringent response restrictions on translation of proteins may still be necessary. In such instances, the relA1123 mutation will be used ( (h) Mutations Which Increase the Level of Eukaryotic Cell Invasion In some embodiments, vaccines may exhibit sub-optimal levels of eukaryotic cell invasion. One of the major mechanisms of S. Typhimurium invasion of animal hosts is by entering and traversing the epithelial monolayer through microfold (M) cells. The hilA (hyper-invasion an OmpR/ToxR family transcriptional regulator that activates expression of invasion genes in response to both environmental and genetic regulatory factors. To improve M cell-mediated Salmonella invasion, the PhilA::Ptrc lacO888 hilA mutation will replace the native hilA promoter sequence ( V. Exemplary Recombinant Bacterium An exemplary recombinant bacterium of the invention may express one or more than one protective antigen as detailed above. Specifically, in one embodiment, a recombinant bacterium may comprise a balanced-host vector system such that the chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid sequence that is altered is aroC, and the extrachromosomal vector comprises a PspA fusion peptide. For instance, the aroC mutation may be aroC1083, and the PspA fusion peptide may be a fusion between Rx1 and EF5668. In another embodiment, a recombinant bacterium may comprise a balanced-host vector system such that the chromosomally encoded essential nucleic acid sequence that is altered is aroD, and the extrachromosomal vector comprises a PspC fusion peptide. For instance, the aroD mutation may be aroD769, and the PspC fusion peptide may be a fusion between L-81905 and EF6796-G54. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant bacterium may comprise both an aroC balanced-host vector system and an aroD balanced-host vector system. In such an embodiment, recombination between the extrachromosomal vectors of the balanced-host vector systems may be minimized by not including homologous sequences on the vectors. A recombinant bacterium may also express one or more than one antigens using a regulated delayed lysis vector, as detailed in section IV(c) above. Specifically, in one embodiment, a bacterium may comprise a PmurA::TT c2 mutation. These mutations may be complemented with a vector that allows arabinose dependent expression of murA and asd. This vector may comprise one or more antigens. For instance, the vector may comprise a Ply antigen, a PcsB antigen, a PsaA antigen, or a combination thereof. In an exemplary embodiment, a bacterium of the invention may express five different antigens by comprising the following mutations: aroC1083 balanced by a vector encoding a PspA fusion peptide between Rx1 and EF5668, aroD769 balanced by a vector encoding a L-81905 and EF6796-G54, with a vector encoding Ply, PsaA, and PcsB antigens. An exemplary bacterium of the invention also comprises one or more than one mutation that attenuates the bacterium, including one or more mutations that allow regulated attenuation. For instance, in one embodiment a bacterium of the invention may comprise one or more than one of the exemplary embodiment, a bacterium may comprise two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight mutations selected from the group comprising embodiments, an exemplary bacterium of the invention may comprise at least one mutation that affects the persistence of the bacterium. For instance, a bacterium may comprise one or more than one of the exemplary embodiment, a bacterium may comprise two, three, four, five, or six mutations selected from the group comprising embodiments, an exemplary bacterium of the invention may comprise at least one mutation that reduces fluid secretion in a host. For instance, a bacterium may comprise a sopB mutation such as sopB1925. In an especially exemplary embodiment, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may comprise one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen mutations selected from the group may express one or more antigens selected from the group comprising Ply, PsaA, PcsB, PspC, and PspA antigens. In another embodiment, a may express two, three, four or five antigens selected from the group comprising Ply, PsaA, PcsB, PspC, and PspA antigens. In still another embodiment, a recombinant bacterium of may express selected from the group comprising Ply, PsaA, PcsB, PspC, and PspA antigens. A recombinant bacterium of the invention may be derived from, or posses the genetic characteristics of, a strain in Table C. Similarly, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may comprise a plasmid detailed in Table D. VI. Vaccine Compositions and Administration A recombinant bacterium of the invention may be administered to a host as a vaccine composition. As used herein, a vaccine composition is a composition designed to elicit an immune response to the recombinant bacterium, including any antigens that may be expressed by the bacterium. In an exemplary embodiment, the immune response is protective, as described above. Immune responses to antigens are well studied and widely reported. A survey of immunology is given by Paul, W E, Stites D et. al. and Ogra P L. et. al. Mucosal immunity is also described by Ogra P L et. al. Vaccine compositions of the present invention may be administered to any host capable of mounting an immune response. Such hosts may include all vertebrates, for example, mammals, including domestic animals, agricultural animals, laboratory animals, and humans, and various species of birds, including domestic birds and birds of agricultural importance. Preferably, the host is a warm-blooded animal. In an exemplary embodiment, the host may be subject to infection by S. pneumoniae. The vaccine can be administered as a prophylactic or for treatment purposes. In exemplary embodiments, the recombinant bacterium is alive when administered to a host in a vaccine composition of the invention. Suitable vaccine composition formulations and methods of administration are detailed below. (a) Vaccine Composition A vaccine composition comprising a recombinant bacterium of the invention may optionally comprise one or more possible additives, such as carriers, preservatives, stabilizers, adjuvants, and other substances. In one embodiment, the vaccine comprises an adjuvant. Adjuvants, such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, are optionally added to increase the ability of the vaccine to trigger, enhance, or prolong an immune response. In exemplary embodiments, the use of a live attenuated recombinant bacterium may act as a natural adjuvant, obviating the need for any additional adjuvants. The vaccine compositions may further comprise additional components known in the art to improve the immune response to a vaccine, such as T cell co-stimulatory molecules or antibodies, such as anti-CTLA4. Additional materials, such as cytokines, chemokines, and bacterial nucleic acid sequences naturally found in bacteria, like CpG, are also potential vaccine adjuvants. In another embodiment, the vaccine may comprise a pharmaceutical carrier (or excipient). Such a carrier may be any solvent or solid material for encapsulation that is non-toxic to the inoculated host and compatible with the recombinant bacterium. A carrier may give form or consistency, or act as a diluent. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers may include liquid carriers, such as normal saline and other non-toxic salts at or near physiological concentrations, and solid carriers not used for humans, such as talc or sucrose, or animal feed. Carriers may also include stabilizing agents, wetting and emulsifying agents, salts for varying osmolarity, encapsulating agents, buffers, and skin penetration enhancers. Carriers and excipients as well as formulations for parenteral and nonparenteral drug delivery are set forth in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 19th Ed. Mack Publishing (1995). When used for administering via the bronchial tubes, the vaccine is preferably presented in the form of an aerosol. Care should be taken when using additives so that the live recombinant bacterium is not killed, or have its ability to effectively colonize lymphoid tissues such as the GALT, NALT and BALT compromised by the use of additives. Stabilizers, such as lactose or monosodium glutamate (MSG), may be added to stabilize the vaccine formulation against a variety of conditions, such as temperature variations or a freeze-drying process. The dosages of a vaccine composition of the invention can and will vary depending on the recombinant bacterium, the regulated antigen, and the intended host, as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art. Generally speaking, the dosage need only be sufficient to elicit a protective immune response in a majority of hosts. Routine experimentation may readily establish the required dosage. Typical initial dosages of vaccine for oral administration could be about 1\u00d7107 to 1\u00d71010 CFU depending upon the age of the host to be immunized. Administering multiple dosages may also be used as needed to provide the desired level of protective immunity. (b) Methods of Administration In order to stimulate a preferred response of the GALT, NALT or BALT cells, administration of the vaccine composition directly into the gut, nasopharynx, or bronchus is preferred, such as by oral administration, intranasal administration, gastric intubation or in the form of aerosols, although other methods of administering the recombinant bacterium, such as intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous injection or intramammary, intrapenial, intrarectal, vaginal administration, or other parenteral routes, are possible. In some embodiments, these compositions are formulated for administration by injection (e.g., intraperitoneally, intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, etc.). Accordingly, these compositions are preferably combined with pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles such as saline (including buffered saline), Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and the like. VII. Kits The invention also encompasses kits comprising any one of the compositions above in a suitable aliquot for vaccinating a host in need thereof. In one embodiment, the kit further comprises instructions for use. In other embodiments, the composition is lyophilized such that addition of a hydrating agent (e.g., buffered saline) reconstitutes the composition to generate a vaccine composition ready to administer, preferably orally. VIII. Methods of Use A further aspect of the invention encompasses methods of using a recombinant bacterium of the invention. For instance, in one embodiment the invention provides a method for modulating a host's immune system. The method comprises administering to the host an effective amount of a composition comprising a recombinant bacterium of the invention. One of skill in the art will appreciate that an effective amount of a composition is an amount that will generate the desired immune response (e.g., mucosal, humoral or cellular). Methods of monitoring a host's immune response are well-known to physicians and other skilled practitioners. For instance, assays such as ELISA, and ELISPOT may be used. Effectiveness may be determined by monitoring the amount of the antigen of interest remaining in the host, or by measuring a decrease in disease incidence caused by S. pneumoniae in a host. For certain pathogens, cultures or swabs taken as biological samples from a host may be used to monitor the existence or amount of pathogen in the individual. In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for eliciting an immune response against S. pneumoniae in a host. The method comprises administering to the host an effective amount of a composition comprising a recombinant bacterium of the invention In still another embodiment, a recombinant bacterium of the invention may be used in a method for eliciting an immune response against S. pneumoniae in an individual in need thereof. The method comprises administrating to the host an effective amount of a composition comprising a recombinant bacterium as described herein. In a further embodiment, a recombinant bacterium described herein may be used in a method for ameliorating one or more symptoms of infection by S. pneumoniae in a host in need thereof. The method comprises administering an effective amount of a composition comprising a recombinant bacterium as described herein. The following examples are included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples that follow represent techniques discovered by the inventors to function well in the practice of the invention. Those of skill in the art should, however, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments that are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, therefore all matter set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.EXAMPLES The following examples illustrate various iterations of the invention.Example 1 Salmonella Typhi Vector Construction Description Three live recombinant attenuated Salmonella Typhi vaccines (RASV) expressing S. pneumoniae surface protein PspA-Rx1 have been constructed. (see S. to PspA-Rx1 antigen to yield 9640(pYA4088). S. pneumoniae PspA-Rx1 antigen to yield 9633(pYA4088). Description of all Mutations and Sequences The following is a complete description of each deletion mutation engineered into the Ty2 and ISP1820 parent wild-type strains. In addition to the restoration of rpoS in the Ty2 derivative made by allelic exchange from the suicide vector pYA3467 containing the rpoS gene, there are eight deletion mutations incorporated into ISP1820 S. Typhi, seven deletion mutations incorporated into Ty2 RpoS and Ty2 RpoS+ and RpoS+ and purposes, an S. Typhimurium UK-1 strain was constructed to enable safety and immunogenicity studies in a murine model. pmi-2426 deletes the interconverts fructose-6-phosphate and mannose-6-phosphate. Table 1 below shows the virulence of the pmi-2426 mutation, in an S. Typhimurium strain, in mice. To ensure that all mannose provided to the vaccine strain during growth prior to vaccination is directed at LPS O-antigen synthesis, we include the (gmd-fcl)-26 mutation ( (gmd-fcl)-26 deletes two structural genes that encode and synthetase for conversion of GDP-Mannose to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-Mannose and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-Mannose respectively, thus blocks colanic acid production. ( araE25 deletes the structural gene for the low-affinity L-arabinose transport system proton symport protein that promotes the internalization and externalization of L-arabinose, thus enhancing retention of L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase, preventing use of arabinose retained in the cell cytoplasm at the time of oral immunization. ( sopB1925 deletes a gene for reduction of fluid secretion and neutrophil accumulation in the intestinal tract. ( tviABCDE10 deletes the structural genes for synthesis of the Vi antigen, an external capsular polysaccharide and an essential virulence factor and protective antigen of S. Typhi. ( agfBAC811 deletes the structural aggregative fimbriae. ( asdA33 aspartate -semialdehyde dehydrogenase which is required for the synthesis of diaminopimelic acid (DAP), an essential component of peptidoglycan ( Pcrp527::TT deletes the promoter sequence of gene and inserts the 1,335 bp TT araC PBAD fur deletes the 239 bp promoter sequence of the fur gene and inserts the 1,335 bp TT araC PBAD cassette for arabinose regulated the 2,247 bp of the relA gene including 12 bp of the SD sequence and 2235 bp of ORF and inserts 2,393 bp containing araC PBAD lacl TT sequence encoding for arabinose regulated lacl synthesis. ( In studies with live attenuated S. Typhi strains in adults, mild diarrhea is observed in about 10 to 20 percent of volunteers. Since this might be a more common or severe problem in immunizing infants and children, we have evaluated fluid secretion by S. Typhimurium strains with specific mutations, including those to give a regulated delayed attenuation phenotype, using injection of strains into ileal loops of rabbits and measuring inflammatory symptoms histologically and accumulation of fluid. Strains with the sopB1925 mutation exhibit reduced symptoms with only slight attenuation (Table 6) or reduced ability to colonize lymphoid tissues after oral vaccination. Salmonella lipid A is a mixture of closely related species that contain between 5-7 fatty acid moieties decorated with other small molecules ( The role of the individual mutations in mouse virulence was determined (Table 7). The LD50 of the wild-type strain, 3761, (1.0\u00d7104 CFU) was similar to that previously observed (Kong Q, Liu Q, Roland K L, Curtiss R 3rd. Infect Immun. 2009). The pagP8 mutant strain 9434 had the same oral LD50 as wild-type, consistent with a previous report that a pagP mutant is unaltered for virulence when introduced by the intraperitoneal route (Belden, 1994). The LD50 of 9845 (pagL7 was 10-fold the LD50 of 9732 (pagP81::Plpp approximately 105-fold greater than either 3761 or 9434, although at the highest doses we observed mild to severe clinical manifestations of disease (scruffy coat, lethargy, and death) from which some mice recovered. Strain 9705 (pagL7 pagP81::Plpp IpxE IpxR9) was completely avirulent, and no disease symptoms were observed even at the highest dose, suggesting a LD50 value at least 105-fold greater than the wild-type strain. The greatly attenuated phenotype for both 9732 and 9705 was not due to a general growth defect, as each mutant strains had a similar growth curve to 3761 when grown in LB medium (data not shown). The pagP81::Plpp IpxE strains, 9732 and 9705, exhibited an LPS profile similar to 3761, although the O-antigen banding pattern was less distinct. In addition, 9732 and 9705 were slightly more sensitive to bile salts and SDS than other strains, which may affect their survival in the intestinal tract. Nevertheless, each mutant strain was able to colonize mouse lymphoid tissues. Similar numbers of bacteria were recovered from Peyer's patches, liver and spleen for each strain, 3 days post-inoculation ( Surviving mice from the LD50 experiment for and 9705 (inoculation from 1.0\u00d7106 to 1.0\u00d7109 CFU) were challenged orally lethal inoculum of the wild-type strain 3761 (1.0\u00d7109 CFU) thirty days after administration of the attenuated strains. All mice immunized with 9732 or 9705 were protected from challenge. Taken together, these data indicate the triple mutant 9732 (pagL7 pagP81::Plpp IpxE IpxR9) is completely attenuated, yet remains sufficiently immunogenic to give protection with wild-type challenge with a shift in LD50 of 105-fold.Example 4 Enhanced Antigen Expression by Inclusion of (wza-wcaM)-8 Mutation The mutation (wza-wcaM)-8 deletes twenty structural genes from wza to wcaM that encode colanic acid synthesis genes, thus blocking colanic acid production ( The use of attenuated bacteria as vaccine delivery vehicles for heterologous antigens has been studied extensively in both animals and humans. Attenuated Salmonella is the best choice due its ability to, when given orally, stimulate both cell and humoral-mediated immunity against a heterologous antigen and thus provide protection against pathogen challenge. A good live oral Salmonella vaccine would retain its ability to colonize and invade host lymphoid tissues but would be completely avirulent after oral administration. The lipopolysaccharide of Salmonella is a recognized virulence determinant, and contributes to several stages of the infectious process, including swarming motility, intestinal colonization, serum resistance, invasion/intracellular replication, and resistance to killing by macrophages. Rough Salmonella strains that do not make the O-antigen side chains or outer core or inner core sugar were not able to survive the succession of stresses encountered in vivo and were less virulent than the smooth Salmonella strain. Therefore, structural rough mutants have been considered to be inappropriate live vaccine carriers. There are currently many other attenuating mutations being investigated by researchers involved in vaccine development, but it is a good choice to manipulate LPS synthesis gene to develop vaccine. Theoretically, a moderate decrease in the number and/or length of LPS chains can lead to attenuation paralleled by retained immunogenic potential to deliver the heterologous antigen. Three Salmonella Typhimurium strains have apparently provided attenuation through modification of LPS. Two of these mutations, galE and pmi, are involved in synthesizing the sugars of LPS. GalE is a UDP-galactose epimerase that inter-converts UDP-glucose and UPD-galactose, an essential part of core sugar and O-antigen. This mutant synthesized core-defective LPS in the absence of galactose but made normal LPS when galactose was available in the growth media. The avirulence of this mutant in the murine model of Typhoid was thought to be due to the fact that the strains were susceptible to galactose-induced lysis. However, this same mutation, transferred to S. Typhi, was not attenuated and was poorly immunogenic in humans. Following a similar concept, a pmi knockout in Salmonella Typhimurium was constructed and evaluated in our lab. Pmi is a phosphomannose isomerase, which converts fructose-6-P to mannose-6-P, and, in vivo, the deletion mutant is unable to synthesize the O-antigen due to inavailability of mannose, which is a component of O-antigen. When the mutant is grown in the presence of mannose, the smooth LPS phenotype is exhibited. This mutant was attenuated but also showed high immunogenicity and efficacy in enhancing induction of high antibody titers to cross-protective OMPs, however, the pmi deletion in Typhi has not yet been evaluated in humans. Both galE and pmi mutant strains transiently express LPS before colonizing the GALT or organs. Another gene involved in LPS biosynthesis, rfaH, was evaluated in BALB/c mice. RfaH is a transcriptional anti-terminator, and is involved in the synthesis of many virulence determinants including O-antigen, core sugar, capsular polysaccharide, and Vi antigen. An rfaH deletion mutant, described as \"gently rough\", exhibited some deep-rough characteristics, i.e. lack of O-antigen and outer core, sufficient attenuation, susceptibility to detergents and to some antibiotics, but still proved to be immunogenic. Rfc (Wzy) is a polymerase responsible for polymerizing the O-unit, and, in conjunction with Wzx (transporter), Wzz (length determinant) and WbaP (O-antigen synthesis initiation). synthesizing, assembling, and transporting the O antigen to the periplasm, where WaaL (Ligase) ligates O-antigen to lipid A to form complete LPS (Whitfield, 1995) (Raetz, 2002) (Tran, 2009). The mutant with an rfc deletion constitutively makes LPS with a single O-unit in each core molecule, which is designated as a semi-rough phenotype. Salmonella with an rfc mutation exhibited good colonization and immunogenic attributes against Salmonella Typhimurium when orally inoculated BALB/c mice. A tightly regulated araC PBAD activator-promoter has been used extensively in our lab to regulate gene expression. We replaced the rfc promoter with an araC PBAD promoter to create arabinose inducible production of Rfc and thus regulate rfc expression to mimic transient expression of smooth LPS; this is similar to the manner in which the galE or pmi phenotypes are controlled by the availability of, galactose or mannose. It is of interest to evaluate the ability of each mutant to deliver heterologous antigen to the host immune system and the strain's ability to protect the host against subsequent challenge.Example 6 Mutations that Increase Reusability of the Vector System in the Host fljB217 deletes the flagella gene encoding Phase 2 flagella antigen in S. Typhimurium, which does not exist in S. Typhi. The deletion encompasses 1,247 base pairs from fljB300 to fljB+26 ( fliC2426 deletes the flagella gene encoding Phase 1 flagella antigen. The deletion encompasses 1,488 base pairs including the ATG start codon and including the TAA stop codon ( fliC180 deletes the part of flagella gene encoding Phase 1 flagella antigen. The deletion encompasses 540 base pairs encoding flagella antigen from amino acid 181 to amino acid 360 ( fliC240 deletes the part of flagella gene encoding Phase 1 flagella antigen. The deletion encompasses 720 base pairs encoding flagella antigen from amino acid 181 to amino acid 420 ( ompA deletion encompasses 1050 base pairs encoding ompA antigen starting from ATG start codon to TAA stop PCR complementary to DNA sequences up-stream and down-stream of that flank the ompA gene generate a DNA fragment that is 1050 bp shorter when using DNA from the mutant with the ompA mutation than DNA from the wild-type parent strain. The ompA 11 mutation does not contribute to attenuation and S. Typhimurium strains with this mutation have the same virulence for mice as the wild-type parent (Table 10). The S. Typhimurium with ompA reduces the ability of the bacterium to synthesize dominant surface antigens, diminishes immune response to dominant Salmonella antigen ( Various mutations are described below and shown in (araC PBAD)-5::PR araBAD44: Changed original TGGA to AGGA and the second and the third codon to K (lysine) from A, to enhance the expression of araB. (araC PBAD)-5::PR13 araBAD44: Addition to the modification in the araB region, further modification in the OR1 region by changing G and C bases to T and T (underlined and bolded) to reduce the binding of the repressor C2. (araC PBAD)-5::PR14 araBAD44: Addition to the modification in the araB region, further modification in the OR3 region by changing G and C bases to A and T (underlined and bolded) to reduce the binding of the repressor C2. (araC PBAD)-5::PR15 araBAD44: Addition to the modification in the araB region, further modifications in the OR1 and OR3 region by changing G and C bases to T, T and A, T (underlined and bolded) to reduce the binding of the repressor C2.Example 8 Construction of Recombinant Plasmid Containing aa 3-257) The mature (588 amino acids) contains a highly immunogenic a-helical region that spans amino acids 3-257. This immunogenic region of PspA/Rx1 (255 amino acids; 765 base pairs) was selected for use as a test antigen. For overexpression of PspA/Rx1 fused to the -lactamase signal sequence, the fragment of the pspA/Rx1 gene specifying the immunogenic -helical region (amino acids 3-257) was cloned into the pYA3493 vector ( The N-terminal primer contains an EcoRI site (underlined). The C-terminal primer specifies two consecutive stop codons (TAA TAG; boldface) followed by a HindIII site (underlined). The amplified PCR product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII enzymes, and then cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pYA3493, resulting in pYA3494. The in-frame fusion of PspA/Rx1 with the 3-lactamase signal sequence was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The nucleotide sequencing data showed that one base pair G is missing at position 703 causing the frameshift after amino acid 233. For overexpression of His6-tagged PspA/Rx1, the fragment of the pspA/Rx1 gene specifying the immunogenic -helical region (amino acids 3-257) was cloned into the pYA3342 vector. The 765 bp DNA fragment was PCR amplified from template pYA3193 DNA using the primers: The N-terminal primer contains an EcoRI site (underlined) and six consecutive histidine codons (alternate use of CAT and CAC; boldface) for His6 tagging at the N-terminus. The specifies two consecutive stop codons (TAA TAG; boldface) followed by a HindIII site (underlined). The amplified gene fragment, digested with EcoRI and HindIII enzymes, was then cloned into the pYA3342 vector using the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pYA3342, resulting in pYA3496. The in-frame fusion of PspA/Rx1 to His6 tag confirmed nucleotide sequencing. pYA3635 (Codon Optimization of PspA/Rx1 aa 3-257) In order to optimize PspA expression, the following nine rare codons contained in the pspA/Rx1 gene of pYA3494 were altered: 2nd CCC to CCG, 57th CTA to CTG, 77th CTA to CTG, 95th ATA to CTG, 221st CTA to CTG. All codon changes were designed to introduce the optimal codon used by Salmonella without altering the amino acid sequence of PspA. Additionally, a G was inserted at position 703. Mutations were introduced into the gene sequence by PCR. Primers containing the altered codon sequence were used to amplify different fragments harboring the optimal codons. These fragments were then used as template to run a second round of amplification in order to assemble the final sequence containing all the altered codons. The optimized gene sequence was cloned into pYA3493 using the EcoRI and HindIII sites to generate pYA3635. After cloning, an additional two codons in pYA3635 were altered by the same PCR GCT and nucleotide of the codon optimized pspA/Rx1 was verified by and pYA4088 (PspA/Rx1 aa 3-285) ( The pspA/Rx1 gene was extended to include amino acids 258-285 bp three rounds of PCR amplification. In the first amplification, the pspA/Rx1 gene was amplified from the DNA template pYA3635 using the primers: The 820 bp gene fragment generated from the first reaction was used as the template for the second PCR amplification with the primers: The 849 bp PCR fragment produced in the second step was used as the template for the third and final amplification with primers: This reaction produced an 869 bp gene fragment which was cloned into pYA3493 using the EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites. The resulting plasmid was pYA4088. In-frame cloning was verified by sequencing and enzyme digestion. Example 9 Improvements in Induction of Enhanced Immune Responses to Expressed Recombinant S. pneumoniae PspA Antigens by Using the 6-Lactamase Type II-Like Secretion Pathway We have expressed the -helical domain of the S. pneumoniae Rx1 to PspA protective antigen as a fusion to the 3-lactamase signal sequence. Half of the protein was secreted with an equal apportionment to the periplasm and to the cell exterior without cell lysis. The antibody titers induced to PspA were significantly higher than to S. Typhimurium LPS and OMP antigens. The DNA sequence encoding the fusion of the -helical domain of PspA from strain Rx1 to the -lactamase export system (bla SS) has been engineered to depend on the Asd+ balanced-lethal system. The plasmid pYA4088, shown in Using lacl Constructions. Over-expression of protective antigens by RASV strains can be deleterious, reducing colonizing ability and thus immunogenicity. On the other hand, high-level expression of recombinant protective antigens is very important to induce significant protective mucosal and systemic antibody responses. The Ptrc that we have used is constitutive under most environments but actually is more transcriptionally active both anaerobically and aerobically than other promoters selected for in vivo activity. For this reason, we have generated the relA198::TT araC PBAD lacl TT deletion-insertion mutation so that vaccine strains growing in culture in the presence of 0.2 percent arabinose synthesize the LacI repressor at high level to repress transcription from Ptrc on the Asd+ plasmid vectors until after vaccination when the vaccine strain is already colonizing internal lymphoid tissues. This has been achieved by increasing the expression of the lacl gene by changing the SD sequence from AGGG to AGGA, the lacl start codon from GTG to and optimizing all codons for high-level expression of lacl in Salmonella. Strains with the relA196::TT araC PBAD lacl TT deletion-insertion mutation present in 9226 and 9226 are unaltered in virulence. The presence of the araBAD23 deletion, which further increases the amount of LacI synthesized, also has no appreciable effect on virulence (9509 Table 12). The stability of the Asd+ PspA plasmid pYA4088 was evaluated in strains 9633(pYA4088), 9639(pYA4088) and 9640(pYA4088) grown in broth medium without DAP to simulate the same conditions to be used in the clinical trial. The stability of pYA4088 in each Asd bacterial host was subsequently determined by growing the strain in the broth media with DAP for approximately 50 generations which was accomplished by a succession of subcultures over a 6-day period. At the end of approximately 50 generations of growth, 100 colonies each from the Working Seed, from the 1st and from the 5th passages were analyzed for the requirement for diaminopimelic acid (DAP). Representative colonies were further tested for the presence of the 3927 bp plasmid and the expression of the PspA protein. Master seed and working seed banks of each vaccine organism in separate vials have been prepared for frozen storage in vegetable-based cryopreservative. Purity of the seed banks was established following standard operating procedures Full characterization of the seed banks includes phenotypic evaluation on selective media, PCR, antigenic agglutination, colorimetric assays, LPS gel analysis, production of catalase to reveal the RpoS phenotype and demonstrated to reflect the correct and anticipated phenotype and genotype of the three vaccine strains. Antibiotic sensitivity testing has confirmed that these strains are sensitive to ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Table 13). Ampicillin, typically tested for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for Salmonella. The vials of vaccine Working Seed are maintained frozen in designated boxes and entered into the freezers' inventory logs. The Working Seed vials are stored in duplicate freezers maintained between 65\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 C. Vaccine stability is determined by titration of representative vials of each of the RASV-Sp Master and Working Seed banks at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 months and every 6 months thereafter. Table 14 shows the stability of the RASV-Sp Master Seed and Working Seed stocks as determined by quarterly viable titration. Live, whole bacteria constitute the unformulated active immunogenic substance that when fermented in permissive conditions will be formulated with sterile PBS pH 7.4 to produce the final vaccine product. The final vaccine products will be prepared on the day of administration to the volunteers in the clinical trial to optimize immunogenicity and fitness of the strains. Briefly, a 37\u00b0 C. overnight culture of each vaccine strain is prepared from a frozen vial of RASV-Sp Working Seed. The next morning, the cultures are subcultured 1:20 into fresh, prewarmed media and shaken gently at 37\u00b0 C. to an optical density (OD) at 600 nm ideally between 2.0-2.3. The cells are harvested by centrifugation and resuspended gently in sterile PBS to the final dosage prescribed. Data collected from production runs of the vaccine dosages conducted prior to the start of the clinical trial will be used to correlate the OD600 of the final PBS cell suspension to CFU/ml (GCGH-ASU-SOP-096-00, see CMC section of the IND application). This data will be used to confirm the target range of the final dosage prior to releasing the vaccine dosages to the clinic. Table 15 shows the production record of three consecutive dosages of the RASV-Sp inocula for producing 10-ml final liquid dosages of live vaccine for oral administration to adult volunteers. The data provide assurance that the RASV-Sp vaccine inocula can be consistently produced within the target range of the dosage required on the start date of the clinical trial. Formulation The human fasting stomach can reach pH levels as low as 1.5. Low pH tolerance of the RASV-Sp strains was tested after suspending cells in medium at pH 7, 4.5 or 3 for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. Viability of the samples after incubation was assessed by plate counts. Data shown are the average number of CFU/ml recovered. In these studies, we included the parental wild-type S. Typhi ISP1820 strain (8110) that had been used in a previous trial in which reactogenicity was observed. In all cases, the vaccine constructions 9633(pYA4088), 9639(pYA4088) and 9640(pYA4088) were more acid sensitive than their wild-type parents or than the attenuated ISP1820 strain 8110 ( The PBS used as the diluent is unlikely to provide sufficient buffering activity. Since the stomach pH rises dramatically upon ingestion of food, we plan to increase the stomach pH of volunteers by administering Ensure nutrition shakes prior to administering the vaccine dosages. Stability of RASV-Sp Strains The RASV-Sp vaccine dosages maintain a stable titer suspended in the PBS at room temperature for a period of less than 2 hours. It should be noted that S. Typhi is an obligate human pathogen and no animal models are available for a full evaluation of the S. Typhi-based vaccines. Inoculation of newborn mice with high doses of wild-type virulent strains of S. Typhi, even when modified to express the S. Typhimurium virulence plasmid needed by S. Typhimurium to cause disseminated disease in mice, fails to infect or cause any signs of disease or any weight loss. We constructed, in parallel of the engineering of S. Typhi, S. Typhimurium strains bearing essentially identical mutations as the S. Typhi-based vaccines for pre-clinical safety and immunogenicity evaluation in mice. Safety of S. Typhimurium 9558(pYA4088) in Newborn Mice. A relevant safety test was to evaluate the safety in newborn and infant mice of S. Typhimurium mutations nearly identical to the S. Typhi vaccine strains and the same plasmid to enable PspA expression. Newborn mice are highly susceptible to wild-type S. Typhimurium infection and succumb at oral doses lower than 100 CFU. Newborn and infant mice were orally inoculated with 5 l containing 1-3\u00d7108 CFU of the strain 9558(pYA4088) at 0, 2, 4 or 7 days of age. Table 16 shows the health status and survivors over a 10-week period. No disease symptoms or death occurred in any of the mice at any time after oral inoculation with over 106 times the wild-type LD50. Distribution of S. Typhimurium 9558(pYA4088) in Tissues of Newborn Mice Colonization of tissues from newborn and infant mice was evaluated 3 and 7 days after oral inoculation with the S. Typhimurium strain 9558(pYA4088). Homogenized tissue samples from euthanized mice were spread onto agar plates and CFU/g enumerated. In addition, samples of homogenized tissues were also subjected to enrichment culture to reveal presence or absence of Salmonella. Table 17 shows the tissue distribution of the attenuated S. Typhimurium strain 9558(pYA4088) in newborn mice to 7 days of age. The levels of colonization of the intestinal tract by S. Typhimurium 9558(pYA4088) were quite good. In this regard, it should be noted that isolation of Peyer's patch tissue in these infant mice to determine Salmonella titers is not feasible. Titers in liver and spleen were lower than expected but this was interpreted as an indication of the safety of 9558(pYA4088) for newborn and infant mice. These data in Table 14 and Table 15 show that the attenuated S. Typhimurium vaccine strain with mutations nearly identical to the S. Typhi vaccine strains is safe for newborn and infant mice. Therefore, it can be extrapolated from these data that these mutations provide an equivalent level of safety to the S. Typhi vaccines. Evaluation of Safety of S. Typhi Vaccine Strains in Young Mice. Newborn mice (<24 h) were each orally inoculated with 10 l containing 1\u00d7109 CFU of each of the S. Typhi vaccine strains. Table 18 shows the health status and survivors over a six-week period. No disease symptoms or death occurred in any of the mice at any time after oral inoculation. Distribution of S. Typhi Strains in Tissues of Newborn Mice. Although S. Typhi can invade murine cells with low efficiency (compared to S. Typhimurium), they do not survive well or multiply and quickly decline in titer following oral administration. For this reason, the ability of S. Typhi to colonize (or not colonize) murine tissues is not necessarily indicative of the ability of the strain to colonize human tissue. However, the distribution of S. Typhi cells in tissues from newborn mice was evaluated as an addition to the data from the S. Typhimurium RASV-Sp strain 9558(pYA4088) (see Table 17). Colonization was assessed 3 and 7 days after oral inoculation with the S. Typhi vaccine and wild-type strains. The attenuated ISP1820 strain used in a previous trial (8110) and the typhoid vaccine strain Ty21a were also included for comparative purposes. Homogenized tissue samples from euthanized mice were spread onto agar plates and CFU/g enumerated. In addition, samples of homogenized tissues were also subjected to enrichment culture to reveal the presence or absence of Salmonella. These data demonstrate that the mutant vaccine candidate S. Typhi strains colonize mouse tissues no better than the wild-type parental strains. The additional strains Ty21a and 8110 showed similarly poor levels of colonization. These results were not unexpected, since mice are unable to support an infection with S. Typhi strains even when infected soon after birth. Reactogenicity of PBS Diluent With and Without S. Typhi The general safety test as directed in 21 CFR 610.11 was performed to address concerns raised of the possibility that residual media components might be reactogenic in volunteers. The RASV-Sp PBS cell suspensions were filter-sterilized and these cell-free solutions, along with sterile PBS and sterile growth medium were injected intraperitonneally into mice and guinea pigs. The weight, health and general well-being of study animals were monitored daily for 7 days. At the conclusion of the study, animals were euthanized and necropsied, and observable differences of the internal organs (including alterations in size, shape, coloration and vascularization) were photographed for comparative analysis. All animals survived for the duration of the general safety test (7 days after injection). No unexpected or nonspecific responses were observed with any of the RASV-Sp strains as compared to the PBS controls. The average weights for each group throughout the course of the study are shown in No diminishment of the health and general well-being, and no change in the character of internal organs of mice and guinea pigs were noted. These data provide evidence to support the conclusion that the trace amount of residual media components present in the final vaccine preparation is unlikely to be reactogenic in human volunteers. Immunogenicity Assessment of S. pneumoniae Antigen The immunogenicity of the PspA antigen of S. pneumoniae was assessed using the Asd+ plasmid vector pYA3634. The pYA3634 plasmid is a and encodes aa 3-257 of the PspA-Rx1 protein (pYA4088 spans aa 3-285) (See Four weeks after the second oral immunization, mice were challenged in two experiments with approximately 5\u00d7104CFU of S. pneumoniae WU2. Both experiments gave similar results, and the data have been pooled for presentation and analysis. This challenge dose resulted in the deaths of 100% of the unvaccinated mice, with a mean time to death of 2-3 days. The percent protection rate and the number of days of survival after challenge with virulent S. pneumoniae strain WU2 are shown in Passive Transfer of Pneumococcal Immunity. An experiment to demonstrate passive-antibody transfer of protective immunity to pneumococcal challenge was conducted in mice. Mice were orally inoculated with 1\u00d7109 CFU of a RASV-Sp strain containing either the empty vector pYA3493 or the vector pYA3634 and boosted with the same strain and dose 8 weeks after primary immunization. At week 12, sera from immunized mice were collected and pooled. Na\u00efve, syngeneic BALB/c mice received 100 l in the tail vein of undiluted serum from pooled serum of immunized mice. All groups were challenged intraperitoneally 12 h later with S. pneumoniae WU2. The percent survival of mice receiving pooled serum was assessed 15 days after challenge with S. pneumoniae WU2. Table 19 shows the percent survival of mice that were protected by passive-antibody transfer from challenge with more than 250 LD50 doses of the virulent S. pneumoniae WU2. Sera from mice immunized with S. Typhimurium 9558(pYA3634) passively protected 100% of mice challenged with over 250 LD50 doses of the virulent S. pneumoniae WU2. Immunogenicity of 9639(pYA4088), and 9640(pYA4088) in Female 6- to 7-Week-Old BALB/c Mice. The ability of the S. Typhi RASV-Sp strains administered intranasally to BALB/c to induce serum antibody titers to PspA was assessed (GCGH-ASU-SOP-074-00, see CMC section of the IND application). Mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 l of approximately 109 CFU of a RASV strain with either the empty vector pYA3493 or the PspA+ vector pYA4088. Sera were collected 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after vaccination and anti-PspA, -LPS and -OMP IgG titers determined by ELISA. It should be noted that this type of immunogenicity assay has been used by others even though we believe it is of marginal value. This is because S. Typhi (wild-type or mutant) is unable to successfully invade and persist in murine cells or lymphoid tissues as is S. Typhimurium. Complement Deposition Assay and Passive Protection of Mice Using Serum from Human Vaccine Volunteers. Sera from the vaccine volunteers which test positive for PspA will be evaluated for their ability to passively protect mice from pneumococcal infection. Passive transfer of protective immunity to pneumococcal challenge will be demonstrated by transfer of pre- and post-immune serum and the antibodies it contains to naive unimmunized mice followed by intravenous challenge with virulent S. pneumoniae. As an additional measure of the protective capacity of the anti-PspA response in volunteers, sera may be further evaluated by the complement deposition assay. This test will quantitatively evaluate the ability of antibody in pre- and post-immune sera to facilitate deposition of complement C3 onto S. pneumoniae. Immunization of humans with PspA has been shown to lead to elevated levels of antibody to PspA, increases in the ability of the sera to mediate complement deposition on S. pneumoniae, and increases in the ability of human sera to protect mice from fatal pneumococcal infection. The deposition of complement on S. pneumoniae has been shown to correlate inversely with the ability of S. pneumoniae to cause invasive disease.Example 13 Non-Clinical Assessment of Safety Additional safety tests were conducted to address concerns raised regarding the apparent lack of adequate safety data for the ISP1820 derivative strain 9633(pYA4088). Another ISP1820 derivative, 8110 cfs), (cya-27 crp-pabA-40 cfs), was shown to be safe in Phase I clinical trials. To bridge the previous human data with 8110 to the present vaccine candidate 9633(pYA4088), additional safety data were generated to demonstrate that 9633(pYA4088) is equivalent to or more attenuated than 8110 as evaluated by survival in human blood and peripheral blood monocytes. Comparisons to the Ty21a vaccine Vivotif\u00ae which is the gold standard for live Salmonella vaccine safety were also included in the following non-clinical assessment of safety. Survival of RASV-Sp Strains in Human Blood The bactericidal effects of heat-treated and untreated whole blood were compared by incubating the RASV-Sp strains and wild-type S. Typhi counterparts in the presence of normal whole blood (GCGH-ASU-SOP-081-01, see CMC section of the IND application). Approximately 1\u00d7106 CFU of each RASV-Sp strain, 8110, Ty21a and their wild-type counterparts were added to duplicate 1.5 ml blood aliquots from volunteers. Blood was collected in accordance with the ASU human use protocol #0804002872. Survival of the Salmonella strains was assayed in blood that had been heat inactivated (HI) by incubation at 55\u00b0 C. for one hour prior to inoculation, or in untreated, active (A) blood. Viability of the Salmonella strains was measured by plating samples on permissive media 0, 3, 6 and 18 hours after inoculation. The RASV-Sp candidates are severely attenuated in their ability to survive in whole human blood as compared to wild-type S. Typhi and 8110. Vaccine strain levels drop below the threshold of detection within 3 hours and the strains did not regrow at the later timepoints of the assay. This is in contrast to 3744, 3769 and 8110, which are not only present at significantly higher levels, but also replicate in the blood at the later timepoints of the assay. The RASV-Sp candidates, including the ISP1820 derivative 9633(pYA4088), are as attenuated Ty21a and more attenuated than the ISP1820 RASV 8110 used in a previous clinical trial. Sensitivity of RASV-Sp Strains to Native Guinea Pig Serum Complement. The bactericidal properties of guinea pig serum complement were determined for the RASV-Sp strains and their wild-type counterparts. Guinea pig complement was used for this assay because of its high level of bacteriocidal activity. GCGH-ASU-SOP-062-01 Preparation of RASV-Sp dosages for adult volunteers. The sensitivity of the cells to complement was assayed following GCGH-ASU-SOP-091-00 Resistance of RASV-Sp strains to guinea pig complement. Strains were assayed in PBS only, complement (purified from guinea pig serum) only, and complement with anti-S. Typhi O-antigen D1 opsonizing antibody. Reactions were incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00b0 C., and then the viability of the Salmonella strains was measured by plating on permissive media. Data shown in Both the wild-type Salmonella Typhi strains and the RASV-Sp strains are sensitive to killing by complement in the presence of Salmonella Typhi O-antigen specific D1 antibody. The vaccine strains are killed to a moderately higher degree than the wild-type strains. In the absence of S. Typhi-specific antibody, the wild-type strains are resistant to complement-mediated killing. However, the RASV-Sp strains exhibit a high level of sensitivity to complement-mediated killing even in the absence of opsonizing antibody. Survival of RASV-Sp Strains in Peripheral Human Mononuclear Cells. Rubin et al. demonstrated that in patients with typhoid fever, circulating S. Typhi cells are associated with mononuclear cell-platelet fraction of whole blood. Because this serovar does not typically cause disease in mice or other animals, the development of rapid ex-vivo assays using freshly elutriated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have been demonstrated as reliable tools for determining attenuation of S. Typhi for vaccine research and development. PBMCs derived from blood of 3 different volunteers were elutriated following GCGH-ASU-SOP-082-01 Survival of RASV-Sp strains in peripheral human mononuclear cells. After incubation of PBMCs and bacteria in 24-well culture plates for 1, 3 and 23 additional hours, PBMCs were lysed and cell lysates were plated onto permissive media to determine viable CFU. Survivability of the RASV-Sp strains peripheral blood mononuclear cell assay used to measure the invasion and persistence of the S. Typhi strains readily distinguished between virulent S. Typhi and the attenuated RASV-Sp strains and Ty21a, known to survive poorly both in vitro and in vivo. The wild-type Ty2 and ISP1820 strains invaded and persisted at a significantly higher rate than the RASV-Sp strains and Ty21a (p<0.05). Both 9639(pYA4088) and Ty21a were the least fit to survive and persist in PBMCs compared to the wild-type Ty2 RpoS strain (p=0.0022 and 0.0022 at 24 hours, respectively), which may be a consequence of possessing the rpoS mutation. These results are consistent with the RpoS phenotype in that null mutants are susceptible to killing by macrophage and exhibit increased sensitivity to environmental stress. The ISP1820 derivative 9633(pYA4088) was equivalent to 8110 in surviving within PBMCs at 2, 4 and 24 hours (p=1.00, 0.505 and 0.878, respectively) and both strains were significantly reduced in their ability to invade and persist within PBMCs compared to the wild-type ISP1820 at all timepoints. Together these data demonstrate further safety of the RASV-Sp strains. Additionally the ability of the ISP1820 derivative 9633(pYA4088) to invade to a lesser degree than the wild-type ISP1820 but persist at a low level in PBMCs demonstrates that this strain is not compromised to reach host target cells to deliver the PspA for antigen processing. Taken collectively, the RASV-Sp strains are adequately attenuated due to their extreme sensitivity to complement-mediated killing, their poor survival in whole human blood and in fresh elutriated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The ISP1820 derivative 9633(pYA4088), although sufficiently attenuated by the data presented here, may display the best attributes for antigen presentation to the appropriate antigen-presenting cells of the host immune system. RASV-Sp Shedding and Survival in Human Stool A consequence of oral administration of live Salmonella vaccine organisms is that they can be shed transiently in the stool of vaccine recipients. An important aspect of the potential impact of environmental release of a live vaccine is to evaluate the duration, rate of shedding and the survival rate. Endeavors to develop live vaccines that reduce shedding have been met with variable success. The licensed live oral typhoid vaccine, serovar Typhi Ty21a, is shed at low rates in the stools of most vaccinees for 1 to 4 days. Ideally, it is desirable to limit the number of genetically modified microorganisms entering the environment, without decreasing vaccine immunogenicity or efficacy. An initial assessment of the duration of shedding following oral inoculation was conducted in 6-week old adult mice. The S. Typhi RASV-Sp strains and 9640(pYA4088), and 8438 were grown. Approximately 1\u00d7109 CFU of each strain was administered orally to groups of 3 mice. Shedding was monitored for 6 days after inoculation by homogenizing fecal pellets and plating on selectively differential media. The data shown in Table 20 represent the average number of CFU/ml detected for each group. None of the S. Typhi strains (wild-type or RASV-Sp) were detected more than 3 hours following the inoculation. The S. Typhimurium RASV-Sp strain 9558(pYA4088) was also not detected after the initial day of inoculation. These data indicate that significant levels of vaccine organism shedding are confined to the initial day of immunization. Low-level shedding (less than 103 CFU/ml) may occur for a slightly longer period. Since S. Typhi is unable to efficiently attach to and invade to the intestinal epithelial cells of mice, the results of the previous study may not accurately represent the duration of shedding from a human host. In order to gather data about the competitive fitness of the strains in the human intestinal environment, the RASV-Sp and wild-type S. Typhi strains were evaluated in anaerobic human stool samples. Viability of the S. Typhi strains was assessed by plating dilutions onto selective media 1, 3, 7 and 10 days after inoculation of fresh stool suspensions with approximately 1\u00d7108 CFU/ml. Inoculated samples were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in an anaerobic environment. The limit of detection for recovering the S. Typhi strains was 104 CFU/ml. These data represent the worst case scenario as the RASV-Sp strains were prepared in this study to allow the regulated-delayed expression of the near wild-type attributes that would endow the strains with characteristics that would make them most fit for survival. In reality, once ingested by volunteers, the strains will eventually lose and no longer display these protective attributes due to the absence of exogenous arabinose and mannose and would rapidly succumb to the harsh and competitive environment present in stool. Survival of S. Typhi in Canal Water, Chlorinated Water and Sewage The aim of this study was to compare the survivability of the RASV-Sp strains and S. Typhi wild-type counterparts in several conditions that mimic the environment and to address concerns regarding the impact of releasing live attenuated, genetically-modified organisms into the environment. Three environmental conditions were prepared to serve as test material for assessing survivability of the S. Typhi strains. Chlorinated water was prepared to contain approximately 3 to 5 ppm chlorine. The S. Typhi test strains were washed twice to remove residual media and approximately 1\u00d7108 CFU of each strain were added to triplicate tubes containing the test solution. Raw sewage was retrieved from a local waste water treatment plant in Phoenix, Ariz. Untreated canal water was collected from the Phoenix metropolitan area. Viability of the S. Typhi strains was assessed by plating dilutions onto selective media 1, 3, 7 and 10 days after inoculation of the triplicate test solutions with approximately 1\u00d7108 CFU/ml. The limit of detection for recovering the S. Typhi strains was 104 CFU/ml. In summary, the data show that the RASV-Sp strains do not have a competitive advantage in chlorinated water, untreated surface water or sewage over naturally-occurring organisms and are no more likely to persist in these conditions than the wild-type Salmonella Typhi.Example 14 Response to S. Typhi Vaccines in Adult Mice Immunized by Intranasal Response Immune Response to S. Typhi Vaccines in Adult Mice Immunized by Intranasal Response. Adult BALB/c mice (7 weeks) were inoculated intranasally with approximately 1\u00d7109 of RAStyV expression plasmid pYA4088 or control plasmid pYA3493 in 10 l, and boosted with the same dose of the same strain six weeks later. Sera were collected 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after vaccination and serum IgG responses to rPspA, S. Typhi LPS and S. Typhi OMPs were measured by ELISA. This experiment was performed twice, with each group (8 mice) receiving approximately the same dose of vaccine. Sera from all mice in a group were pooled for analysis. Absorbance levels of a secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated to HRP was recorded at 405 nm using an automated ELISA plate reader (model EL311SX; Biotek, Winooski, Vt.). Absorbance readings that were 0.1 higher than PBS control values were considered positive. The results from both experiments were similar and have been pooled for analysis. Results: All mice immunized with strains expressing pspA developed anti-PspA titers ( Mucosal IgA anti-PspA responses were slow to develop, but reached high titers after boosting ( Protection of Adult Mice Immunized with S. Typhi Vaccines Against Challenge with Virulent S. Pneumoniae. Method: At week 10, mice were challenged by intraperitoneal injection with 1.0\u00d7104 CFU of S. pneumoniae WU2 (50 LD50) in 100 l BSG. Challenged mice were monitored daily for 30 days. Result: All mice immunized with three S. Typhi vaccine strains expressing pspA were significantly protected compared with controls ( Method: For colonization studies, 0, 2, 4 and 7 day-old pups (6/group) born from either na\u00efve or immunized mothers were orally inoculated with 5 l containing approximately 5\u00d7108 CFU of 9558 (pYA4088). Mice were euthanized on days 3 and 7 post-infection and samples of the upper intestinal tract (ileum, jejunum and duodenum), spleen and liver were collected. Tissues were weighed and homogenized in a total volume of 1 ml BSG. Serial dilutions were plated onto MacConkey arabinose and 0.2% mannose to determine the number of viable bacteria. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for at least 18 h. Also, 900 l of homogenized tissues were inoculated into 5 ml selenite broth (Difco) for Salmonella enrichment. Samples that were negative by direct plating and positive by enrichment were recorded as 10 CFU/g. Samples that were negative by both direct plating and enrichment were recorded as 0 CFU/g. Result: The ability of 9558 (pYA4088) to colonize intestine, liver, and spleen was examined when administered to pups 0, 2, 4 or 7 days of age born from either na\u00efve or immunized mothers. Overall, immunization of the mother had the greatest effect on inhibiting colonization in pups inoculated at 4 and 7 days of age, but had no negative effect on pups inoculated at 0 or 2 days of age ( Method: To assess the immune responses to rPspA after immunization in early life, 18-24 neonatal (7-day-old), and infant (21-day-old) mice per group from na\u00efve or immunized mothers were orally immunized with approximately 5\u00d7108 CFU of (pYA4088) or strain 9558 harboring the control plasmid pYA3493. For convenience, these groups will be referred to as N 7 d (na\u00efve mother, pups immunized at day 7), I 7 d (immunized mother, pups immunized at day 7), N 21 d (na\u00efve mother, pups immunized at day 21) and I 21 d (immunized mother, pups immunized on day 21). Mice were immunized again 3 and 6 weeks following the first dose. Age-matched control mice were given sterile BSG to serve as non-immunized controls. Serum IgG antibody responses to rPspA and Salmonella LPS and mucosal IgA responses to PspA were measured. This experiment was performed twice with similar results, which have been pooled for analysis. Result: The anti-PspA serum titers in mice from immunized mothers were higher at three weeks post-primary immunization than the responses in mice born from na\u00efve mothers ( Vaginal washes were used to evaluate mucosal responses. This also allowed us to keep the mice alive for challenge studies. At week 8 vaginal washes were collected and evaluated in the 12-17 female mice per group. No mucosal samples were taken from the remaining male mice. Development of mucosal IgA responses was dramatically and significantly enhanced by maternal immunity ( Method: To evaluate the capacity of 9558(pYA4088) to protect mice immunized as neonates or infants, immunized mice (18-24 mice per group) were challenged intraperitoneally with 2\u00d7103 CFU (10 LD50) of S. pneumoniae WU2 four weeks after the final boost (11 weeks of age). Result: All mice inoculated with 9558(pYA3493), a Salmonella strain that does not express pspA, or with BSG, succumbed to the infection within 3 days ( Although S. Typhimurium serves as a model for S. Typhi, the two organisms differ in many respects. For that reason, the effect(s) of the proposed second generation mutations on the phenotype of S. Typhi were compared to S. Typhimurium to ensure that all improvements to the vaccine would have the desired effect. Many mutations resulted in a phenotype not significantly different from S. Typhimurium and will not be described in this section. Three examples of mutations that differed between S. Typhi and S. Typhimurium are described below. Please refer to Table 21 for a list of all strains evaluated. Plasmid Recombination in recF S. Typhi Strains Deletion of the recF gene in S. Typhimurium has been shown to substantially reduce the frequency of recombination between plasmids within a cell. This allows stable carriage of multiple plasmids. However, a Ty2 recF126 S. Typhi strain (11053) carrying two plasmids with homologous sequences has the same frequency of interplasmid recombination as the wildtype Ty2 (Table 22). Deletion of other rec genes, such as recA (known to reduce interplasmid recombination in S. Typhimurium) and recJ (known to reduce interplasmid recombination in E. coli) has no impact on the frequency of interplasmid recombination in S. Typhi. The deletion of recF in S. Typhi is able to reduce the frequency of intraplasmid recombination (recombination between homologous sequences on the same plasmid), which was not observed in S. Typhimurium. Invasion of Human Cells by S. Typhi with Flagellar Truncations Large internal deletions in the flagellin protein frequently reduce the motility of strains, but in S. Typhimurium, the lack of motility presents no obstacle to epithelial cell invasion or to strain virulence. In S. Typhi, clinical observations of typhoid patients have indicated that there is a correlation between reduced motility, reduced cell invasion and strain attenuation. These same studies also indicate that internal deletions in the flagellin protein can reduce the likelihood of disease complications such as meningitis. Two internal deletions of the flagellin protein were evaluated\u2014fliC181 (deletion of the 180 aa comprising the variable domain of flagellin) and fliC241 (deletion of 240 aa comprising the variable domain and the TLR5 binding site)\u2014as well as a complete deletion of the flagellin protein (fliC2426). In both Ty2 and ISP1820, all mutations in the flagellin protein resulted in severely decreased motility on 0.3% BactoAgar (Table 23). However, a decrease in motility correlated with a decrease in cellular invasion only for strains derived from Ty2 ( Strains were spotted onto 0.3% motility agar and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 16 hours. LPS O-Antigen Production by (galE-ybhC)-851 S. Typhi Strains The (galE-ybhC)-851 deletion was created to render O-antigen production dependent on the presence of galactose, thus contributing to the delayed attenuation of the strain as well as its biological containment. This deletion was introduced into the ISP1820 and Ty2 wild-type S. Typhi strains (generating 11247 and 11248, respectively). LPS O-antigen production was assayed by growing strains in nutrient broth, then subculturing in nutrient broth in the presence or absence of 0.05% galactose and growing to stationary phase. LPS present on cells was analyzed by SDS-PAGE ( Methods: Mice were immunized orally with 1.0\u00d7109 CFU Salmonella on day 0, day 7, and day 42. On day 56, mice were challenged intranasally with 5\u00d7106 CFU S. pneumoniae EF3030 in 10 l PBS. After five days, 200 l of PBS was flushed through the trachea, out the nose, and collected. One hundred microliters of PBS was slowly injected into the lung and slowly suctioned out. Results: Mice immunized with 9241 harboring the plasmid containing PcsB fused to the signal sequence of DsbA showed higher immune responses and had significantly lower nasal colonization of S. pneumoniae EF3030 ( The same strategy may also be used to increase the expression and secretion of StkP in Salmonella.Example 20 PsaA Significantly Decreases Nasal and Lung Colonization of S. pneumoniae in Mice An experiment to demonstrate protective immunity to pneumococcal challenge was conducted in C57BL/6 and Balb/C mice. Plasmid pYA4729 encodes the full length from S. pneumonia strain Tigr4. This plasmid and pYA3342 arabinose at C. LB with 0.05% arabinose with aeration at 37\u00b0 C. to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8 to 0.9. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at room temperature (6,000\u00d7g for 15 min), and the pellet resuspended in buffered saline with gelatin (BSG). Serial were plated onto MacConkey agar supplemented with 1% lactose to determine titer. Mice were intranasally or orally inoculated with 10 or 20 l of BSG containing 1\u00d7109 CFU of the RASV strain. At week 6, the mice were boosted with the same strain at 109 CFU/mouse. At week 10, mice were challenged intranasally with 5\u00d7106 CFU S. pneumoniae strain L82016 or E134. Nasal washes were performed using 1 ml of saline after 5-6 days. Serial dilutions of the samples were plated in duplicate on blood agar containing 4 mg/ml gentamicin. Alpha-hemolytic colonies were counted after incubation of the plates for 24 h at 37\u00b0 C. The detection limit was 20 CFU/ml. For representation in the graphic and statistical analysis log10 was applied to the values and recovery of 0 CFU was considered 20 CFU. In C57BL/6 mice challenged with S. pneumoniae serotype 6B strain L82016, there is significant reduction of S. pneumoniae nasal colonization in the 9241(pYA4729) by intranasal and oral immunization compared to the control animals that received 9241(pYA3342) (P<0.05 for intranasal immunization and P<0.05 for oral immunization) ( Administration of 9241(pYA4729) induced significant reduction of serotype 23 S. pneumonia of E134 colonization compared with the 9241(pYA3342) group by intranasal and oral immunization (P<0.02 for intranasal immunization and P<0.02 for oral immunization in BALB/c mice) ( Construction of a RASV conferring maximal protective immunity to diverse pneumococcal strains will be best achieved by delivery of multiple protective antigens. Since the protective PspA antigen has multiple B-cell epitopes, we have constructed a fusion that represents the diversity found among pneumococcal strains representing PspA Family 1 and PspA Family 2. This trial was conducted in compliance with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice E6 (ICH-GCP) and the applicable Food and Drug Administration and other Department of Health and Human Services regulatory requirements. Study design is summarized below and in Objectives: Objective 1. To evaluate maximum safe tolerable single dose levels of the three recombinant attenuated S. Typhi vaccine ISP1820) using dose escalation studies in healthy adult volunteers. Objective 2. To evaluate immunogenicity of the three recombinant attenuated S. Typhi with regard to their abilities to induce mucosal and systemic antibody and cellular immune responses to the S. pneumoniae PspA antigen and to Salmonella LPS and outer membrane protein (OMP) antigens. Study Outcome Measures Primary Outcome Measures: Safety and tolerability will be measured by assessment of reactogenicity and Adverse Events following vaccination. Escalation to the next dose level will occur only after review of the safety data from day 28 post-inoculation of the previous Arm. Secondary Outcome Measures: Immunogenicity testing will include antibody and/or cellular responses to vaccine at Days 0, 7, 28, 84 and 168. Hypotheses Tested The recombinant attenuated ISP1820 vaccine vectors will be safe when given orally to healthy adult human volunteers. The 9640(pYA4088) S. Typhi Ty2 RpoS+ recombinant attenuated vaccine vector will higher titers of antibodies to the Streptococcus pneumoniae PspA antigen than will the parental vector. The 9633(pYA4088) S. recombinant attenuated vaccine vector will induce higher titers of antibodies to the Streptococcus pneumoniae PspA antigen than will either the RpoS or 9640(pYA4088) S. Typhi Ty2 RpoS+ vaccine. Study Design The study was a dose escalating study divided into four Arms (1-4). Each Arm will consist of 3 groups (A-C) of 5 healthy young adults 18-40 years of age and each group (A-C) will be administered one of three different vaccine vectors. Each subject will receive an oral dose of vaccine on day 0 and be followed closely to determine the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the vector. The vaccine vector found to be both safe and immunogenic with maximum immunogenicity and ease of genetic manipulation will be selected as the parent for second generation vaccine vectors to deliver multiple S. pneumoniae protective antigens. Arm 1 will evaluate the attenuated in an initial single oral dose (107 CFU), evaluating safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant attenuated strains. An escalation in dose will proceed only after demonstrating the safety and tolerability of the lower vaccine dose through Day 28. Arm 2 will evaluate an escalation of dose (108 CFU) for safety and immunogenicity in 3 groups of 5 new volunteers. An escalation dose will proceed only after demonstrating the safety and tolerability of the lower vaccine dose through Day 28. Arm 3 will evaluate an escalation of dose (109 CFU) for safety and immunogenicity in 3 groups of 5 new volunteers. An escalation dose will proceed only after demonstrating the safety and tolerability of the lower vaccine dose through Day 28. Arm 4 will evaluate an escalation of dose (1010 CFU) for safety and immunogenicity in 3 groups of 5 new volunteers. This is the highest dose to be tested The dose escalation schedule is provided below: The study will enroll Arms 1 through Arms 4 in succession as data are reviewed following each Arm and the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) authorizes the next Arm to enroll based on review of 28-day safety data including final blood and stool culture results obtained from previous Arm. This review cycle allows for an interval of a minimum of 35 days of review of all data from the current Arm, after enrollment of the last subjects in the current Arm, before proceeding to the next higher dosage Arm of the study. Maximum Limit of Tolerability and Dose Escalation of a Specific Strain Escalation to the next dose level of any of the three vaccine vectors will occur only if the safety data in the preceding dose level cohort for a specific vaccine are acceptable to the SMC and the PI. Escalation to higher dose levels for each of the three vaccines shall proceed in this manner until the highest dose level is reached, or dose-limiting toxicity (maximum limit of tolerability) prevents further dose escalation. Dose escalation of a specific strain shall not proceed in the event that: 3 or more individuals within 1 dose level develop the same severe laboratory abnormality and the abnormality is deemed medically significant by the SMC and is determined to be associated with vaccine; or if 2 or more individuals develop a severe systemic reaction that is determined to be associated with the vaccine; or if 1 individual develops an SAE determined to be associated with vaccine. Subject Selection Criteria Volunteers will be healthy 18-40 year old male or non-pregnant female adults who fully understand the purpose and details of the study. Subject exclusion criteria include history of Salmonella infection or vaccination, and a history of pneumococcal vaccine. Claims 1.
