This is what the spray bottle looked like: If my partner asked me to pick up some fragrance spray, I'm not sure if I would spot the aromatherapy/crystal woo, or particularly care if this product happened to be the cheapest on offer.

The aromatherapy/crystal marketing has nothing to do with it. The product name: Better Homes & Gardens Lavender & Chamomile Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones, That is about as woo a name as anything I could come up with as a joke. The irony is the Better Homes and Gardens prefix. My 6 year old Maine coon shits on the floor. Nothing we have done has stopped it. Nothing you've done has stopped it, but have you tried getting rid of the cat? Nope. Because my kids would likely not cotton to that at all and I love the cat otherwise. She's incredibly friendly and cuddly. She just happens to crap on the floor. And odds are good no one else will adopt her if I share with a shelter why we are giving her up. I'm having pretty major surgery soon, and the sheer amount of people trying to push oils and aromatherapy on me as a way to 'shorten my healing' has made me delete nearly all social media and stop replying to some texts. First off, I literally do not have a sense of smell, second off I don't believe in any of this crap being helpful. And now, I REALLY don't want it anywhere near the healing wounds I'll have after reading this article. Sheesh, how enraging. It was a spray from Walmart. Maybe it was selected for the \"woo,\" but more likely it was a combination of placement on the shelf, packaging, and the actual scent (lavender and chamomile).Proof positive that not only can woo therapies waste time and money, sometimes they can be deadly. Same way that most parents gave teething tablets to infants without even noticing the homeopathic text or less common ingredient name of belladonna (AKA deadly nightshade). Things on the shelf say they make babies stop crying, or rooms smell nice and we don't have time to dive deeper because we trust the regulators to keep poison off the shelves. Yeah, but nobody needs that room spray. Aerosolized anything is already pretty questionable. If a room smells bad open a window and fix your diet. That's adorable... Meanwhile in the real world actual people use products like this. Let's not get into how I don't have windows that open in most of my house. Even if I could it's hot, humid and where I live it just kind of stinks because of natural processes. Or the fact I have digestive problems and a glass of water can give me paint peeling farts. But do go on with your fantasy world... Personally, I prefer incense because I think it covers odors better, as well as lingers a lot longer. I also have an oil diffuser, that I use for no other reason than it smells good, but it's a hassle to set up. My 6 year old Maine coon shits on the floor. Nothing we have done has stopped it. At least she has learned to crap on the laundry room floor next to the litter box so we don't find random land mines throughout the house. Anyway, she can often peal paint. Next time I'll remember not to spritz some room scent (lemon grass I think is what my wife got?) once I've cleaned up a real bad one and just open a few windows when it's 100F and 75% humidity outside, or when it's winter and 18F at 10 o'clock when I find it, and leave them open for 20 minutes to air the place out. Or I can sit in my home office 20ft away gagging for an hour if it's a particularly horrible one. And sometimes she is helpful and will go back and take a second small shit a few minutes after I clean up the first one. Check your cat's diet. It could be IBD or a food allergy. We had a similar problem - cat that would randomly poop on the floor, horrible smelling, sometimes bloody. Turns out he's allergic to the ingredients of most mainstream (cheap) cat food. Switched to a grain free, limited ingredient diet - no more shit on the floor. It's more expensive but worth it to not have to clean shit off the floor, IMO.. This nonsense needs regulation. No only did it kill people, they have imported a bacterium that is harmful to the rest of us. Like Covid, the bullshit is affecting more than just the rubes.

Which makes it an instant non-buy for me - too many skin irritants also irritate the lungs and eyes, and I'm supposed to spray this around a room? Nope. I suspect \"skin irritant\" was an attempt to keep people from using this as a body spray. By July 12, the boy was taken to a local emergency department and admitted to the hospital, where he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, which may have obscured his melioidosis. Can anyone with a Medical background comment as to whether a patient presenting with Covid would be further tested for other causes of similar symptoms? Not sure even Mass General would find zebras hiding behind Covid. That can happen with a lot of uncomon diseases. Medical diagnosis uses occams razor. Frequente diseases with the same simptoms of rare diseases will allways come first in the diferential diagnostics list. When the diferential diagnostics list contains a uncomon or rare disease that is very grave, it moves to the top. In this case it was a very, very rare disease, even if it was deadly. There are no perfect systems.

And if, for example, you choose a secented candle instead, you are just swapping one hazard for another. Candles cause ~15k house fires per year leading to 150 deaths.

Switched to a grain free, limited ingredient diet - no more shit on the floor. It's more expensive but worth it to not have to clean shit off the floor, IMO.. I appreciate the suggestion. Yeah, we've gone down the allergy path too. But it doesn't seem to be it. I think she is an anxiety reaction. She will not pee in a litterbox either. However, we have at least trainer her to pee on a piddle pad next to the litter box. Every once in a blue moon she'll poop on it too instead of the floor. As near as I, and the vet, can tell is it is probably an anxiety related behavior. Our eldest cat who is about 13 bullies her. It has gotten better over the years, but the times he is most likely to attack her... Right after she has crapped on the floor. Which, like I get. Like, way to go buddy, you tell her not to poop on the floor. But I think it has led to an anxiety complex for her. I've been dragging my feet on it, but actually about the only thing we have not tried are antianxety meds for her to see if that helps. At least the \"kittens\" (quarantine pets, they are about 2 now) both have great behavior. They are siblings. A black male and a tort female, who is half her large older brother's size. Though the black cat (Simon and River [tam]) is bossy towards his servants. He boops me awake at about 30 minutes pre-dawn to feed him. As soon as there is the first hint of light. Jumps on the bed or my dresser, leans over and taps me on the head/forehead until I wake up and come feed them. The only way to stop it is to LOCK them out of my bedroom (then he will sing the songs of his people until I wake up to feed them). Because if I only close our bedroom door, his sister will jump up and TURN the door knob to open it. We do not have lever door knobs, they are round knobs. She is able to jump up, grab the knob with the pads of her paws and TURN it. Then her brother comes in, jumps up, and boops me on the head. And people claim cats do not actually rule the world. The fourth person affected by a bacterial outbreak linked to imported aromatherapy room sprays sold at Walmart last year occurred in a previously healthy 5-year-old boy in Georgia, who died of the infection. I've never found that slathering a good smell on top of a bad one makes the bad one go away, but I think I'm in the minority. I used to ride with people who thought a vanilla air freshener made up for chain smoking with the A/C on \"recirculate\" and it so, so did not as far as I was concerned.

Why, what's wrong with it? The fourth person affected [snip] occurred in a previously healthy 5-year-old boy in Georgia, who died of the infection. The fourth person affected by a bacterial outbreak linked to imported aromatherapy room sprays sold at Walmart last year occurred in a previously healthy 5-year-old boy in Georgia, who died of the infection. Why, what's wrong with it? I feel like we are bit too obsessed by the packaging of the room spray. In the end it's just a fragrance spray and those come in many forms with different marketing claims, and it frankly should not matter whether the parents of this poor little boy bought it for the \"semi-precious stones\" or, much more likely, just for the lavender and chamomile fragrance. Even if you would never buy it you could still be exposed to it somewhere else, like at a friends house or a public restroom. That being said, I would really like to know whether there is any realistic way to prevent cases like this? The article seems to suggests that B. pseudomallei is somewhat common in warmer and humid areas of the world, so is it reasonable to test products coming from an affected region for bacteria? Does it hint at bad hygiene at the production facility, or is this something that could happen anytime everywhere? It was a spray from Walmart.

Things on the shelf say they make babies stop crying, or rooms smell nice and we don't have time to dive deeper because we trust the regulators to keep poison off the shelves. As far as many of these things are concerned, a bribed few in Congress made damned sure that the regulators have no power to act in a way which could diminish their paymasters' profits. Hopes and prayers, just as we were before the scientific revolution. If they're not worried about 27,071 people dying so far this year of gunshot, including 211 young children and 834 teens, you can bet they're not going to act to save a few or a few hundred or even a few thousand people dying of contaminated or poisonous aromatherapy. There is no obligation to take them into our houses and live with them, and no obligation to keep an animal that doesn't meet our expectations and whose behavior is uncorrectable. When an animal is not useful to you, there is no point in feeding it. Euthanasia is an acceptable option. I've never found that slathering a good smell on top of a bad one makes the bad one go away, but I think I'm in the minority. I used to ride with people who thought a vanilla air freshener made up for chain smoking with the A/C on \"recirculate\" and it so, so did not as far as I was concerned. Same here. The bad smell infects the good and makes a smell complex that's overall worse than what you started with. Like someone smeared poop or stale sweat all over your pretty flowers. My wife disagrees though and I think she might be in the majority. But we've often observed I can smell many things she can't - her smeller has always been semi-broken. I'm also easily overcome by too much of a good smell. For example, lavender flowers brought inside are too intense for me, but I enjoy them outside, and I've been made sick from women's perfume.

My vet said the general rule should be at least one more litter box than number of cats in the house, and at least one box per floor. Several tips like that worth checking out. Also make sure the cat's water, food, and litterbox are as far away from each other as possible on any given floor. YMMV because living beings aren't identical, after all. It may also be worth it to get a properly litter-trained \"loaner\" for a few weeks. Anecdotal, but I've heard and read plenty of cat owners describing their incontinent chonker going all \"Whut? we're supposed to go in the gravel quarry?\" on seeing a more senior cat do it's business in the right place - and mending their ways. \"The aromatherapy/crystal marketing has nothing to do with it.\" Not true because toilet bowl cleaner is not marketed as making your health better.

Government regulators are vitally important to any society but their modus operandi is best summarized in the way road and vehicle departments set speed limits; by template and only issue a lower speed limit when the death toll on a given stretch of road exceeds the expected average. I.e. people usually need to die a lot before the government gets itself involved in regulating the cause of death. Just in case you are looking for ideas (if not, I apologize!), have you tried an automatic (self-cleaning) litterbox? I had a cat who'd leave packages just outside a conventional litterbox if my other cat (who sometimes bullied him) had used said litterbox and I'd not yet had a chance to scoop it. The automatic litterbox took care of that problem right away.My 6 year old Maine coon shits on the floor. Nothing we have done has stopped it. Nothing you've done has stopped it, but have you tried getting rid of the cat? Nope. Because my kids would likely not cotton to that at all and I love the cat otherwise. She's incredibly friendly and cuddly. She just happens to crap on the floor. And odds are good no one else will adopt her if I share with a shelter why we are giving her up. "}
