Most of the time our body movements do not cause problems, but it's not surprising that symptoms develop from everyday wear and tear or overuse. [ Elbow ](topic.jhtml?docId=aa136550#aa136550-sec) problems can be minor or serious and may include symptoms such as pain, swelling, numbness, tingling, weakness, or changes in temperature or color. Home treatment often can relieve minor aches and pains. To better understand elbow problems, you may want to review the structure and function of the elbow. See a picture of the [ elbow ](topic.jhtml?docId=tp13079#tp13079-sec). Conditions that may cause elbow symptoms - [Osteoarthritis](topic.jhtml?docId=sto167524#sto167524-sec)may cause pain that is worse in the morning but improves during the day. Other types of arthritis, such as [rheumatoid arthritis](topic.jhtml?docId=str2414#str2414-sec), [gout](topic.jhtml?docId=stg124256#stg124256-sec), and [lupus](topic.jhtml?docId=stl158197#stl158197-sec), can also affect the elbow. - A [pinched nerve](topic.jhtml?docId=aa136625#aa136625-sec)can cause elbow pain with numbness and tingling. - A [problem elsewhere in the body](topic.jhtml?docId=aa136653#aa136653-sec), such as a heart attack, can cause [referred pain](topic.jhtml?docId=str2344#str2344-sec)in the elbow. Overuse elbow problems Most people may not remember having a specific injury when their symptoms get worse over time, but overuse problems are actual injuries. They occur when too much stress is placed on a joint or other tissue, often when you overdo an activity or repeat an activity over and over. Overuse injuries include: - [Bursitis](topic.jhtml?docId=stb117159#stb117159-sec). Swelling behind the elbow may be [olecranon bursitis (Popeye elbow)](topic.jhtml?docId=aa136635spec#tp21119). - Tendinosis, which is a series of microtears in the connective tissue in or around the tendon. - Soreness or pain felt on the outside (lateral) part of the elbow may be [tennis elbow](topic.jhtml?docId=stt11563#stt11563-sec)(lateral epicondylitis). This is the most common type of [tendinopathy](topic.jhtml?docId=stt11569#stt11569-sec)that affects the elbow and most often is caused by overuse of the forearm muscles. This overuse may occur during sports, such as tennis, swimming, golf, and sports involving throwing; jobs, such as carpentry or plumbing; or daily activities, such as lifting objects or gardening. - Soreness or pain in the inner (medial) part of the elbow may be [golfer's elbow](topic.jhtml?docId=aa136518#aa136518-sec). In children who participate in sports that involve throwing, the same elbow pain may be described as [Little Leaguer's elbow](topic.jhtml?docId=aa136364#aa136364-sec). - Soreness or pain felt on the outside (lateral) part of the elbow may be - [Ulnar nerve](topic.jhtml?docId=ax1000#ax1000-sec)compression, which is the pinching of the ulnar nerve in the elbow joint. This usually occurs with repeated motions. Treatment for an elbow problem may include first aid measures; application of a brace, splint, or cast; [ physical therapy ](topic.jhtml?docId=zt1096#zt1096-sec); or medicine. [Check your symptoms](topic.jhtml?docId=elbpb#tw10211) to decide if and when you should see a doctor. Check Your Symptoms The medical assessment of symptoms is based on the body parts you have. - If you are transgender or nonbinary, choose the sex that matches the body parts (such as ovaries, testes, prostate, breasts, penis, or vagina) you now have in the area where you are having symptoms. - If your symptoms aren't related to those organs, you can choose the gender you identify with. - If you have some organs of both sexes, you may need to go through this triage tool twice (once as \"male\" and once as \"female\"). This will make sure that the tool asks the right questions for you. [blue, very pale, or cold](#tf7020)and different from the other arm? [Signs of pain in a baby or toddler](#tf7019)are different than [signs of pain in an older child](#tf7096). [How bad is the pain](#tf7017)on a scale of 0 to 10, if 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain you can imagine? [symptoms of infection](#tf6946)? [weakened immune system](#tf6944), peripheral arterial disease, or any surgical hardware in the area? Many things can affect how your body responds to a symptom and what kind of care you may need. These include: - Your age. Babies and older adults tend to get sicker quicker. - Your overall health. If you have a condition such as diabetes, HIV, cancer, or heart disease, you may need to pay closer attention to certain symptoms and seek care sooner. - Medicines you take. Certain medicines, such as blood thinners (anticoagulants), medicines that suppress the immune system like steroids or chemotherapy, herbal remedies, or supplements can cause symptoms or make them worse. - Recent health events, such as surgery or injury. These kinds of events can cause symptoms afterwards or make them more serious. - Your health habits and lifestyle, such as eating and exercise habits, smoking, alcohol or drug use, sexual history, and travel.

Based on your answers, you may be able to take care of this problem at home. - Try home treatment to relieve the symptoms. - Call your doctor if symptoms get worse or you have any concerns (for example, if symptoms are not getting better as you would expect).

There are other reasons for color and temperature changes. Bruises often look blue. A limb may turn blue or pale if you leave it in one position for too long, but its normal color returns after you move it. What you are looking for is a change in how the area looks (it turns blue or pale) and feels (it becomes cold to the touch), and this change does not go away.

Home Treatment Most minor elbow problems go away on their own. Home treatment is usually all that is needed to relieve your symptoms. Home treatment for minor problems Home treatment may help relieve pain, swelling, and stiffness. - If you have swelling, [remove all rings](topic.jhtml?docId=tp9593#tp9593-sec), bracelets, watches, or any other jewelry that goes around your wrist or fingers of the affected arm. It will be harder to remove the jewelry later if swelling increases. - Use [rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE)](topic.jhtml?docId=tw4354spec#tp21229)to treat pain and swelling. - Wear a [sling](topic.jhtml?docId=sts14925#sts14925-sec)if it makes you more comfortable and supports your elbow. If you feel you need to use a sling for longer than 48 hours, discuss your symptoms with your doctor. - An elbow support, such as an elbow sleeve, forearm wrap, or arm sling, may help rest your elbow joint, relieve stress on forearm muscles, and protect the joint area during an activity. A [counterforce brace](topic.jhtml?docId=aa136481#aa136481-sec)may be helpful for tennis elbow symptoms. Follow the manufacturer's directions for using the brace. - Gently massage or rub the area to relieve pain and encourage blood flow. Do not massage the elbow if it causes pain. - After 48 to 72 hours, if swelling is gone, apply [heat](topic.jhtml?docId=tp20088#tp20088-sec)and begin gentle exercise with the aid of moist heat to help restore and maintain flexibility. Some experts recommend alternating between hot and cold treatments. - Do not smoke. Smoking slows healing because it decreases blood supply and delays tissue repair.
