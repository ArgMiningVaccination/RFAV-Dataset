Nearly half of pet owners consider their animals to be members of the family2. Traditionally, during major disaster responses such as earthquakes and hurricanes, the primary focus of first responders has been on human rescue efforts. However, as we saw in hurricanes Katrina and Rita, pet o wners often stay ed behind at the risk of their own safety to ensure the safety of their pets. This fact underscores the need to factor pets into any major human rescue effort. The first half of this report is intended to inform local and state emergency program managers about Federal regulations regarding incorporating animals into emergency management plans and to illustrate the complexity of developing animal response teams . The second half of this report collects best practice s and relevant information from various government and nonprofit agen cies pertaining to the topics of pre -disaster planning and disaster response for household pets for animal first responders, animal shelter mana gers, and veterinarians . The NASAAEP veterinary medical care best practices working group will address issues of exotic animals, large animals, and working animals in future reports. Background As a result of the 2005 hurricane season, the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006 (PETS Act) was enacted. The PETS Act amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to require the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ensure that state and lo cal emergency preparedness operational plans address the needs of individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster3. This legislation was designed to ensure local, state, and federal governments plan for evacuation, rescue, sheltering, and essential needs of household pets and service animals in the wake of a disaster. FEMA has released Developing and Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans Comprehensive Guide (CPG) 101 version 2.04 to provide guidance for incorporating Household Pets and Service Animals Plans (HPSAPs) into State, Territorial, Tribal, and Local emergency operations plans (EOPs). Each HPSAP should comply with the PETS Act5, which requires the provision of essential assis tance (e.g., rescue, care, shelter, and basic needs) to individuals with household pets and service animals, and to their animals, following a disaster. 1 American Veterinary Medical Association.

(www.govtrack.us/co ngress/bill.xpd?bill+h109 -3858 ) Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 2 In support of the PETS Act, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) issued Disaster Assistance Policy (DAP) 9523.19 entitled, Eligible Costs Related to Pet Evacuations and Sheltering . This policy guides the reimbursement process for governments seeking public assistance for pet -related emergency activities. According to DAP 9523.19, governments th at receive evacuees from areas declared a major disaster area may seek reimbursement under mutual aid protocols through the affected and supported states. For more detail, please refer directly to DAP 9523.19, which may be found on FEMA's Public Assistance webpage6 and is attached to this document as Appendix A . DAP 9523.19 details eligible reimbursements related to shelter facilities, supplies and commodities, labor, equipment, emergency veterinary services, transportation, shelter safety and security, cl eaning and restoration, and the removal disposal of animal carcasses. Household Pets, Service Animals, and Assistance Animals Definitions The term \"household pet\" refers to a domesticated pet, such as a dog, cat, bird, rabbit, rodent, or turtle that is tra ditionally kept in the home for pleasure rather than for commercial purposes and can travel in commercial carriers and be housed in temporary facilities. Household pets do not include reptiles (with the exception of turtles), amphibians, fish, insects/ara chnids, farm animals (including horses), and animals kept for racing purposes. Owners may arrive at public shelters with pets that do not fall within the definition of a \"household pet\" as outlined in DAP 9523.19. Individual jurisdictions should develop procedures to accommodate citizens and these animals; however, such activities will not be eligible for reimbursement. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) redefined its definition of \"service animal\" in 2010 to be a dog that has been individually tr ained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability (see Appendix B)7. The rule states that other animals, whether wild or domestic, do not qualify as service animals. Dogs not trained to perform tasks that mitigate the e ffects of a disability, including dogs used purely for emotional support, are not service animals. The final rule also clarifies that individuals with mental disabilities who use service animals trained to perform a specific task are protected by the ADA. The rule permits the use of trained miniature horses as alternatives to dogs, subject to certain limitations. To allow flexibility in situations where the presence of a horse would not be appropriate, the final rule does not include miniature horses in the definition of \"service animal.\" Service animals are not considered household pets or companion animals. Service animals are not required to be licensed or certifie d by a jurisdiction. It can be challenging for first responders and shelter staff to delineate service animals from pets or companion animals. The ADA does not require service animals to have specific training. A service animal may be excluded from a shelter only if its behavior is a direct threat to the health or safety of people. Duri ng a disaster, a service animal is expected to accompany its owner in rescue/evacuation vehicles and shelters, clinics, and any other facility related to the emergency (e.g., a Federal 6 Federal Emergency Management Agency, Disaster Assistance Directorate. Disaster Assistance Policy 9523.19: Eligible Costs Related to Pet Evacuations and Sheltering, 2007. ( http://www.fema.gov/government/grant/pa/9523_19.shtm ). 7ADA 2011 Revised Requirements - Service Animals ( http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.pdf ) Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 3 Recovery Center). Every effort must be made to provide service animals with food, water, emergency veterinary service, and other basic necessities throughout the duration of the disaster. The U .S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recognize s another category of animals classified as assistance animals. A memo from Sara Pratt, HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Programs, indicated that u nder the F ederal Housing Act (FHAct) and Section 504, individuals with a disability may be entitled to keep an assistance animal as a reasonable accommodation in housing facilities that otherwise impose restrictions or prohibitions on animals. In order to qualify for such an accommodation, the assistance animal must be necessary to afford the in dividual an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling or to participate in the housing service or program. Further, there must be a relationship, or nexus, between the individual's disability and the assistance the animal provides . If these requiremen ts are met, a housing facility, program or service must permit the assistance animal as an accommodation, unless it can demonstrate that allowing the assistance animal would impose an undue financial or administrative burden or would fundamentally alter th e nature of the housing program or services8. States may have laws that further define the assistance animal classification. Recovery FEMA defines recovery as the development, coordination, and execution of service - and site - restoration plans; the reconst itution of government operations and services; individual, private - sector, nongovernmental, and public -assistance programs to provide housing and to promote restoration; long -term care and treatment of affected persons; additional measures for social, political, environmental, and economic restoration; evaluation of the incident to identify lessons learned; post -incident reporting; and development of initiatives to mitigate the effects of future incidents9. Restoring veterinary infrastructure to the pre -disaster state should be a major goal for planners and disaster managers. Responders should not expect to replace or supersede operational veterinary infrastructure in the affected area. Instead, r esponders can assist affected veterinarians and help veterinary infrastructure return to pre-disaster levels in their communities. 8 US Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Memo dated February 17, 2011 (http://www.fairhousing.com/include/media/pdf/serviceanimalmemo.pdf ).

Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 4 Pre-Disaster Preparedness Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 5 Household Pet Responder Training Credentialing Credentialing for household pet disaster responders, including veterinary personnel, is critical to assure a well -managed response. Considerations in credentialing include basic core requiremen ts, educational background, and physical and mental health capabilities. Household pet disaster responders should consider themselves part of the overall disaster response and are subject to the same requirement s as other disaster response personnel . Whe n interstate deployment is required, credentialing and identification will help facilitate a smooth response and ensure that jurisdictions receive trained personnel. Some animal response teams or state jurisdictions may require volunteers to have a crimin al background check prior to allowing membership to an applicant or deployment for a member. Household Pet Responder Training The National Incident Management System (NIMS) has set basic Incident Command System (ICS) training levels for emergency responders (see Figure 1) . Figure 1 - NIMS Training Pyramid Most animal response organizations require the FEMA basic responder training to be completed, which includes: Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 6 1.

Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 9 Figure 2 - Animal Emergency Response Incident Command Structure Template Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 10 Veterinary Personnel Professional Licensure, DEA Licensure and Professional Liability Professional licensure is an issue for all responders required to have a professional license to practice in a state. The exceptions to this rule are federal responders deployed through federal response agencies. When properly deployed as federal assets, these responders are deemed to be licensed in the state to which they are responding. Few states have addressed the issue of temporary licensure for non-federal out-of-jurisdiction responders in the event of a disaster. Interstate deployment through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact helps to address licensure issues but state veterinary boards still have discretion in this area and proper notification and approval needs to be received before any deployment begins. Certain Memorandums of Unde rstanding, such as those between the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Veterinary Medical Assistance Teams (VMAT) program and state animal health authorities, address these licensing issues as well. No veterinary professional should respond o utside their jurisdictional limit without addressing proper licensure first. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Licensure is site - and state -specific. DEA - controlled substances should only be managed and handled by a DEA-licensed veterinarian within t he affected state. Professional liability coverage must be addressed for all responders ; this extends not only to interstate response activities but intrastate and local response as well. Responders must consult with their own liability coverage provider to determine the extent to which they are protected or covered. Some states ' Good Samaritan laws provide liability protection but these vary widely in scope and depth ; thus, each responder should become familiar with applicable local and state laws concerning this issue. Appropriately deployed federal assets, through the National Disaster Medical System National Veterinary Response Team ( NDMS NVRT ) program and the United States Department of Agriculture National Ani mal Health Emergency Response Corps ( USDA NAHERC ) program s, are federally provided with liability coverage while deployed. Some states have also legislated liability coverage for responders when deploying with an appropriate state organization such as a r ecognized Medical Reserve Corp (MRC) unit. It is the responsibility of each responder to ensure they have appropriate liability coverage for their activities. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 11 Considerations for the Veterinary Medical Responder Personal Preparedness Kit and Me dical Cache Personal Preparedness Kit Responders are usually required to bring a personal preparedness kit or \"Go -bag\" with them that will last them for at least 72 hours during their initial deployment to an animal disaster response. Each disaster presen ts a different set of variables to contend with and items brought with a responder should be considered prior to preparation for deployment. An example of a 72 hours \"Go -bag\" may be found in Appendix D. Logistics and Cache When evaluating best practice l ogistical capabilities and cache supplies for veterinary medical disaster and emergency response groups, many factors must be considered and evaluated. To begin to evaluate what a group 's capabilities and cache should be, one must fi rst evaluate the group itself. Initial considerations should include: 1. Mission statement/assigned missions or tasks a. First responders b. Shelter operations c. Animal urban search and rescue support d. Veterinary medical support for local government agency (e.g. animal control) e. All species vs. specific species f. Decontamination support g. Foreign animal disease response support h. Public health response support 2. Territory covered a. Local b. State c. Regional d. Tribal e. National f. International 3. Size a. Incident Type Classification (Class I -IV) b. Number of patien ts c. Number and types of trained and credentialed volunteers and employees Other considerations that are common among all groups include: 1. Storage and accessibility (including size limitations and access to refrigeration). 2. Base equipment (trailer, mobile cli nic, tents, go bags) Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 12 3. Sponsoring agency (state or local Veterinary Medical Association, state department of agriculture, humane group, local or state emergency management, and local or state health department). 4. Ability to handle and manage drug cache (espec ially controlled drugs). 5. Availability/source of supplies (local veterinarians, local suppliers, national distributors). 6. Support by governmental entity/facility (local animal shelter, college of veterinary medicine - teaching hospital). 7. Management (paid, volunteer) 8. Insurance requirements/needs 9. Inventory management (drug rotation, expirations) Once these factors are evaluated, a group can evaluate the status of their current capabilities and cache and make determinations as to needs and wants . See Appendix E for an example of the Veterinary Medical Assistance Team (VMAT) Veterinary Cache Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 13 Disaster Response Best Practice Recommendations Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 14 Household Pet Responder Safety Responder safety is a first priority in any disaster response. The working group has identified the following considerations household pet responders and safety officers should consider during the response effort. Zoonotic Disease and Public Health Issues The Veterinary Standard Precautions (VSP) outlined in the Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions for Zoonotic Disease Prevention in Veterinary Personnel from the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, Veterinary Infection Control Committee are routine infection control practices designed to minimize transmission of zoonotic pathogens from animal patients to veterinary personnel in private practice. The Compendium was first published in 2008 in response to a growing recognition of the occupational risks inherent in veterinary practice and the need for infection control guidance for veterinarians. The Compendium focuses largely on personal protective equipment and actions. A multifaceted approach to workplace safety that incorporat es environmental engineering control measures, appropriate administrative policies, and personal protective actions is recommended. The current edition of the Compendium may be found at the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians website .10 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Responders Selection of the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is a complex process which should consider identification of the hazards (or suspected hazards), the routes of potential hazard to employ ees (inhalation, skin absorption, ingestion, and eye or skin contact), and the performance of the PPE materials (and seams) in providing a barrier to these hazards. The amount of protection provided by PPE is material -hazard specific. Protective equipmen t materials will protect well against some hazardous substances and poorly, or not at all, against others. In many instances, protective equipment materials that provide continuous protection from a particular hazardous substance are not available. In the se cases, the breakthrough time of the protective material should exceed the scheduled work duration. Other factors to consider are matching the PPE to the employee's work requirements and task -specific conditions. The tear resistance and seam strength o f the PPE materials should be considered in relation to the employee's tasks. The effects of PPE in relation to heat stress and task duration should also be considered. In some cases, multiple layers of PPE may be necessary to provide sufficient protecti on to the wearer or to protect PPE inner garments, suits, or equipment. 10 National Association of State Publi c Health Veterinarians website ( www.nasphv.org ). Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 15 Specific knowledge of the hazards at the site or the animals being transported from a site will aid in appropriate PPE selection. As more information about the hazards and site condi tions become available, the safety officer should adjust the level of PPE protection accordingly. The following guidelines may be used by the safety officer to select the appropriate PPE. Per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) (29 CFR 1910.120) standard, four levels of PPE use are recognized (i.e., A, B, C, or D). However, the listing below does not fully address the performance of specific PPE material in relation to specific hazards at the job site, and PPE selection, evaluation and refinement is an ongoing process. Level D Level D is primarily a work uniform level, such as the traditional firefighter turn -out gear. This level requires coveralls and safety shoes/boots, with other PPE (such as gloves) based on the situation. Level D should be worn when the atmosphere contains no known hazard and work functions preclude splashes, immersion, or the potential for unexpected inhalation of or significant contact with hazardous ch emicals. Level C Level C protection should be selected when the type of airborne substance is known, concentration measured, criteria for using air -purifying respirators (APR) met, and skin and eye exposure is unlikely. Periodic monitoring of the air mus t be performed. Required elements include: Full-face or half -mask, APR (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) approved); Chemical resistant clothing (one -piece coverall, hooded two -piece chemical splash suit, chemical -resistant hoo d and apron, disposable chemical -resistant coveralls); Gloves, inner and outer, chemical resistant; Boots, steel toe and shank, chemical resistant. Level B Level B protection should be selected when the highest level of respiratory protection is needed, b ut a lesser level of skin and eye protection is sufficient. In emergency situations, Level B protection is the minimum level recommended until the hazards have been identified and defined by monitoring, sampling, and other reliable methods of analysis. R equired elements include: Positive pressure (pressure demand), NIOSH -approved SCBA or positive pressure supplied air respirator with escape SCBA; Chemical resistant clothing (overalls and long -sleeved jacket, coveralls, hooded two-piece chemical -resistant splash suit, disposable chemical -resistant Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 16 coveralls); Gloves, inner and outer, chemical resistant; Boots, outer, chemical resistant, steel toe and shank. Level A Level A protection should be worn when the highest level of respiratory, skin, eye and mucou s membrane protection is needed. Required elements include: Positive pressure (pressure demand), self -contained breathing apparatus (SCBA, NIOSH approved) or positive -pressure supplied air respirator with escape Self - Contained Breathing Apparatus; Fully e ncapsulating chemical protective suit; Gloves, inner and outer, chemical resistant; Boots, chemical resistant, steel toe and shank (depending on suit boot construction, worn over or under suit boot). NIOSH has identified a number of potential health and safety hazards associated with caring for displaced animals. These include: Bites; Scratches; Crushing injuries; Exposure to zoonotic organisms and bodily fluids; Injuries related to sharp, jagged debris; Heavy -lifting injuries. NIOSH guidelines for PPE to be worn when handling animals include: Gloves o Thick nitrile or polyvinyl chloride gloves offer protection from gasoline, diesel fuels, grease, other oils, and acids; o Provide additional protection against bites and scratches, double gloving with an outer heavy fabric glove may be required. Protective eyewear o Safety glasses do not protect against splash hazards, so tight fitting goggles should be used instead; o Full face shields may be worn for major splashing and to protect against claws and flying debris. Durable clothing o Coveralls or long -sleeved pants and shirts should be worn to protect against animal bites and scratches; o Lightweight, waterproof garment can be worn to prevent liquids from soaking through the undergarments. Protective footwear o Knee -length rubber boots with slip -resistant soles. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 17 N-95 particulate respirator o Protect against spray mists during decontamination; o Fit testing is required. Other factors to consider when selecting protective clothing include the mobility of the user and the susceptibility of the user to heat stress while working. Each disaster poses its own distinct health and safety risks. Therefore, these recommendations are general guidelines only and should not be expected to anticipate or account for all possible d angers. In addition, because the disaster landscape varies with the region and time of deployment, it is important that the safety officer and command staff closely monitor current conditions at deployment sites so that elements of PPE can be modified as necessary. A more comprehensive discussion of the types of protection provided by various levels of PPE and recommendations on when to use a particular level can be found on the OSHA website.11 Vaccinations for Household Pet Responders Household pet respon ders may be at risk for diseases endemic within the response area and are more at risk to exposure of rabies due to intake of animals with unknown or undocumented rabies prophylaxis. See Appendix F for a list of recommended vaccinations for responders. 11US Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration website (http://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/oshasoft/index.html ). Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 18 Triage By Dr. Wayne Wingfield, MS, DVM, DACVECC, DACVS In a disaster involving large numbers of animals, triage is conducted with the purpose of doing the greatest good for the largest number of patients. Disaster triage is an ongoing process and animals may be reassess ed multiples times as necessary (e.g. in the field to determine transportation to a shelter/medical facility or euthanasia , and when arriving at shelters on transport s from the affected area or with owners as they arrive at shelters). Triage entails rapid examination followed by classification of a patient according to the urgency of treatment needs. The triage process requires an organized approach to multiple patients to ensure the most critical animals are identified and normalized first. Thus, triag e is based upon two key points: 1. The immediate medi cal needs of the patient . 2. The available medical resources (facilities, e quipment, personnel, and time). Triage in local disasters requires knowledge of available facilities and capacities immediately adjacent to the disaster as well as knowing this same information for facilities located just outside of the disaster area12. Critically ill patients may require transport to local veterinary facilities, if available, rather than tre atment onsite. Procedures A standard intake form is considered best practice. Currently , the National Animal Rescue and Shelter Coalition (NARSC) recommend including EARS ( RedRover's Emergency Animal Rescue Services) forms. Other forms may be used or required by the local jurisdiction. Forms may also be requested through NARSC at http://www.narsc.net . When completing an intake form for the shelter it is beneficial to indicate the initial triage point to document the progress of an animal's recovery. If an organization creates their own forms it is advantageous to include the following items: Check boxes - Check boxes or yes /no answers minimize time spent on a document and reduces the opp ortunities for errors ; The entire physical exam form should be limited to one page in triplicate. One copy is supplied to the shelter, one copy is retained by the veterinarian, and the other copy is given to the owner; Provide enough space for a veterinar ian to record their professional license number and sign ; Create a space to indic ate the \"next step\" for the animal. 12 Wingfield WE et al. Veterinary Disaster Triage: Making Tough Decision s. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 19 Ongoing assessment forms utilized by the shelter need to be filled out by veterinary personnel every day on every animal. Also, make sure to provide enough space on these forms to record the professional license number and signature of the veterinarian who examined the patient each day. Field Triage Field triage is performed to sort the most severel y injured or sick animals which involves categorizing patients at the disaster site and classify the animals into three categories: 1. \"Likely to survive regardless if care is administered or not\" (GREEN); 2. \"Critical: may survive if lifesaving measu res are administered\" (RED) ; 3. \"Dead or likely to die\" (BLACK). When faced with large numbers of veterinary patients in a disaster, the initial assessment involves an organized, systematic assessment of several important organ systems. Specifically, the triage officer assesses: Respiration , Pulse rate, Pulse chara cter, and Neurological status . This assessment uses the acronym RPPN (see Figure 3). Respiratory distress, abnormal pulse rates, weak pulse character, and abnormal neurological status all require more immediate assessment and pos sible emergency treatment. Additionally, abnormalities in these parameters may direct the veterinarian to pursue euthanasia. These decisions are based upon the patient's physiological status, available resources, and personnel. Field triage only sorts p atients and does not rout inely administer immediate care . Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 20 Figure 3- RPPN Field Triage Flowchart Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 21 Shelter Intake Triage Prior to entry into a shelter intake area, each animal is given a brief evaluation by veterinary personnel to determine the health status of an animal and assess for any serious conditions or highly contagious diseases. Animals should have the following assessments recorded : If an animal appears healthy, it will then be allowed to proceed through the intake area to be processed ; If a minor injury is present and it is assessed the animal only requires a simple treatment , the animal is placed in a tent with appropriate medication or treatment ; If greater care is required, the animal is assigned to a hospital tent; If the incoming animal appears to carry an infectious disease ( e.g. nasal discharge, ringworm) the animal is assign ed to an isolation ward or tent; If the incoming animal is in need of intensive veterinary care , the animal is referred to a n off -site veterinary hospital, if available. Animals are categorized further as they reach their intended locations. An example of detailed shelter assignments is outlined in Table 3. Upon arrival of patients, it is important for staff to remain calm, work quickly, and minimize patient stress. Rapid and efficient triage depends upon a well -developed team approach and a pre -arranged categorization of case priority Table 4 provides a recommendation for such categorization. Table 3- Shel ter Intake Priority System Group Color Type of Injuries Priority 1 / Immediate Red Critical: may survive if simple lifesaving measures are applied Priority 2 / Delayed Yellow Likely to survive if simple care is given within hours Priority 3 / Non-urgent Green Minor injuries; care may be delayed while other patients receive treatment All Groups Blue* Patients have been decontaminated None (Dead or Dying) Black Dead or severely injured and not expected to survive *Blue is not a universally approved triage category but is listed as one means to identify patients that have been decontaminated following the disaster. This gives caretakers more confidence they will not be exposed nor will their facility become contami nated. Additionally, a beha vioral assessment should be completed at intake. A veterinarian or behaviorist (if available) should assess an animal displaying aggressive behavior. When possible , local animal control should be consulted for handling aggressive animals. Aggressive ani mals are a serious sheltering issue and should be isolated from rest of the population as they pose a threat to other anima ls, caretakers, and themselves. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 22 Animals not classified as Household Pet A disaster may cause ca tastrophic casualty management of species not covered by the PETS Act (e.g. , cattle, horses, poultry, reptiles ). With large numbers of animals affected , severely limited medical resources, and poorly tr ained local response personnel these catastrophic casualties remain at the scene for a protracted period of time as they may not be covered under emergency management plans and must be frequently reassessed. Triage is decentralized and often occurs at multiple sites in the disaster zone. In order to address these considerations, the Sec ondary Assessment of Victim Endpoint (SAVE) system of triage is designed to identify animals most likely to benefit from the care available under severe conditions. Most likely the SAVE system will be used for large mass casualty events that may occur in feedlots, poultry hous es, or swine rearing facilities. Triage under the SAVE system is immediate and dynamic. The methodology divides animals into three categories: 1. Those that will die regardless of how much care they receive. 2. Those that will survive whe ther or not they re ceive care. 3. Those that will benefit significantly from intense intervention. Only animals expected to improve should receive additional care above basic husbandry . In this way, resources are more focused. The categorization of an animal outside the common household pet species is based largely upon the experience of the triage team. Little to no information is available regarding the probability of survival for veterinary patients. Post -response, the team can examine those decisions in hopes of improving outcome at the next disaster. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 23 General Intake Procedures in a Disaster R esponse Animal intake is often the most important contact point for animals in the shelter system. The veterinarian's role in the animal intake procedure is essential for infectious disease (prevention and control. Veterinarians should be available through out the entire intake process. At intake, the animal is: 1) Identified through physical description, photograph, and micro chip scanning; 2) Provided a physical examination to determine health status and triaged for treatment of medical conditions ; 3) Provided preventive treatments to reduce risk for infectious diseases ( vaccines, parasite treatment); 4) Assessed for temperament and behavior as necessary to prevent animal bites as part of public health and safety ; 5) Document and report known animal bites. Each step is essential and ensures animals have the best opportunity for a positive outcome. Animals must be pr ocessed as soon as possible after arrival to the facility, preferably within one hour , to quickly identify animals with urgent medical needs as well as to protect the shelter population from infectious disease outbreaks. Specific information on sheltering as well as animal search and rescue are found in the documents produced by the Best Practices Working Group on Sheltering and Animal Search and Rescue Report . Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 24 Field Diagnostics Diagnostic equipment and capabilities Given the variety of animal -disaster combinations that result in a need for disaster veterinary care, the absence of medical records in a typical disaster and the limited patient -veterinarian -client relationship, the requisite field diagnostics may vary greatly. Below is a list of e quipment that might be used in a shelter during an emergency to aid in triage and treatment of incoming animals. To adequately address these needs, the following are considered basic diagnostic equipment for the veterinary health care team: Basic Level Otoscope and Ophthalmoscope Stethoscope Thermometer Mid-Level (includes everything in basic level) Microscope Test Refractometer Felv/FIV Test Heartworm Test Glucometer Urinalysis Dipsticks Advanced Level (includes everything in basic and mid-level) Chemistry Analyzer Radiology Centrifuge Microcrit Centrifuge Giardia snap test Note: Follow appropriate storage and handling of equipment and supplies (to include refrigeration) as recommended by manufacturer's guidelines. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 25 Animal Id entification Dogs and Cats Detection of implanted microchips is an essential component of animal identification and the reunification of pets with their owners. Scanning with a 'global' or 'universal' microchip reader enables the shelter to detect any fre quency of microchip identification (125, 128, and 134.2 kHz). Global scanners currently available include, but are not limited, to the HomeAgain\u00ae Universal WorldScan Reader and Bayer's iMax Black Label Reader (also known as ResQ\u00ae scanner). Global scanners (and extra batteries!) should be available at all impound stations as well as written policies and procedures for scanning at multiple critical contact points. Scanning at multiple points during an animal's shelter stay provides the greatest potential fo r microchip detection. A recent study found that nearly 13% of microchips detected were found after the animal scanned negative at intake13. To maximize the opportunity for detection of microchips, require scanning at each of the following points: In the field for immediate reunification with owner As part of the intake examination upon entry to the shelter Prior to euthanasia It is essential to use consistent speed, scanner orientation, scanning pattern, and scanning distance when using a microchip scanner and to scan the ENTIRE animal. Rocking the scanner slightly side to side will maximize the potential for optimal chip orientation and successful detection. 1. Scanner Orientation - the scanner should all be held parallel to the animal. During scanning , rock the scanner slightly from side -to-side. This will maximize the potential for optimal chip orientation and successful detection. 2. Scanning Distance - the scanner should be held in contact with the animal during the scanning process, in other words it should be very close to the animal either lightly touching the skin or held just over the skin less than an inch away from contacting the patient. 3. Scanner Speed - you should not scan any faster than \u00bd foot per second because the universal scanners must cy cle through various modes to read all possible chip frequencies. GOING SLOW IS THE KEY!! This is extremely important. 4. Areas of Animal to Scan - the standard recommended implant site is midway between the shoulder blades over the back. Scanning should begin over this area (see diagram A). If a microchip is not detected in this region, scan down the back, on the sides, neck and shoulders, down to the elbows and back down the hindquarters. 5. Scanning Pattern - The scanner should be moved over the scanning areas in an \"S\" shaped pattern in a transverse (from side to side) direction over the scanning 13 Internal Auditor Follow -up Report Summary of Audit Corrective Actions, Brevard County, September 14, 2011. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 26 area (see diagram B). If no microchip is detected, the scanner head should be rotated 90 degrees and then the scan should be repeated in an \"S\" shaped pattern in a lon gitudinal direction ON BOTH SIDES (see diagrams C & D). As the scanner moved in this \"S\" shaped pattern over the various contours of the animal's body, it will maximize the ability of the scanner to detect the microchip, regardless of the orientation of th e microchip. Animal identification allows for the tracking of the arrival of every animal through intake to discharge. Once an animal has been identified, using a scanner or other means, it is important for the animal's individual identification to remain on the animal at all times, similar to a hospital neckband. A cage card is not acceptable for ani mal identification as an animal may become displaced from the original cage. Furthermore, an animal should Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 27 be scanned at every critical junction from intake to release as some chips may migrate from the original location. It is recommended that each animal be scanned twice b efore euthanasia is performed. Finally, it is imperative to ensure the information from the shelter is correct on each medical form. If an animal is not micro -chipped upon entry to the facility, an authority should be consulted as to a \"micro -chipping pla n\" upon the animal's release to the owner or to an other shelter.

Scanning for a Microchip http://www.sheltermedicine.com/documents/micro_scan_proc.doc Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 28 Physical Examination of Canines and Felines Shelter health care for canines and felines should begin with a thorough physical examination as soon as possible after admission to ide ntify those requiring immediate further medical care. This examination is more thorough than a triage examination which place pets in priority categories. The exam should identify animals with obvious illness and those requiring immediate isolation to pr event spread of infectious disease. Intake exams are critical to help limit or prevent a widespread disease outbreak, to group animals appropriately in the shelter, and to initiate effective population management. In addition, the intake exam can confirm the accuracy of the animal's description by verifying neuter status and age, conducting a preliminary assessment of temperament, and initiating an ac curate medical shelter record. It is important to note that physical examination of animals occurs at man y areas during intake and sheltering. Reassessment occurs throughout the process and may occur prior to all necessary paperwork being completed. Shelter physical examination procedures should: Implement and enforce biosecurity precautions to reduce the r isk of fomite transmission of infectious diseases. Shelter triage prior to animal intake area to assess any animals with serious conditio ns or highly contagious disease; Staff members should wear disposable exam gloves to handle each animal and change gloves between animals; Staff members should strive to minimize animal contact with clothing. Any staff member who unexpectedly handles a sick or potentially contagious animal should change clothes, thoroughly sanitize hands and arms, and preferab ly handle a different species for the rest of the day; Clean and disinfect common use areas and intake area supplies between animals. Such supplies might include scales, exam tables, and animal handling equipment. Develop a detailed written protocol for i ntake examination. Examination of every animal on intake for injuries, disease, or other conditions that may require immediate intervention is one of the essential responsibilities of the intake team . o The protocol should contain step -by-step instructions for physical examination and a clear plan of action for reporting medical problems at intake and tracking r esponses in the medical record; o Record examination findings (both normal and abnormal) and any treatments in the medical record for each animal (see Appendix G). Weigh all incoming animals and record in the medical record. Body weight is a good indicator for tracking health and welfare concerns during an animal's stay at the shelter, especially for cats. Loss of body Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 29 weight after intake indicates animals may not be eating either due to unmitigated stress or illness. Acquiring an accurate intake weight enables appropriate dosing of parasite treatments and treatments for medical conditions. If a scale is no t available weight should be estimated by a qualified individual with suitable experience and documented as \"estimated\". Assess the body condition score on all animals at intake (examples include the Purina 1 -9 scale or Hills 1 -5 scale). Post the canine an d feline body condition scoring charts at all examination and impound stations; Train staff to evaluate body condition scores; See Appendix H and I for the Purina Cat and Dog Body Condition Scoring System s. Use dentition along with other physical findings to estimate animal age. Weight and body size a re not as accurate as dentition; Adults are defined as 6 months based on eru ption of permanent canine teeth; Juveniles are defined as puppies and kittens < 6 months based on presence of deciduous canine teeth; See Appendix J for the HSUS Aging Dentition Guidelines.

In general, vaccinations minimize the spread of infectious diseases in a high -density, high -risk population such as in a shelter. Modified -live vaccines (MLV) are recommended instead of inactivated vaccines because of potential for quicker onset of immunity and stimulation of humoral and cell mediated immunity responses1415. Vaccinations should be administered as soon as possible upon intake into an emergency shelter. Delaying vaccination or not vaccinating certain populations can compromise the effectiveness of a disease control program and could lead to sustained outbreaks of infectious disease. Early vaccination is essential for optimizing the opportunity to prevent or reduce the severity of shelter -acquired infections. In order to protect public health and the general animal population in a disaste r shelter , vaccinations should be provided unless the owner provides unambiguous documentation of current vaccination status at the time of admission to a shelter or it is determined that vaccination of the animal is contraindicated due to a medical condit ion. If there is proof of current vaccination, there is no reason to revaccinate with canine core vaccines, but feline core vaccin es (specifically Feline c aliciv irus and Feline h erpesv irus), may be of value in boosting immunity16. Unvaccinated animals shou ld not be placed in the general population and should be handled with appropriate biosecurity precautions. Determining Household Pet Vaccination Recommendations The work group reviewe d the following resources in researching vaccination recommendations: 2011 American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) Canine Vaccination Guidelines ; 2010 World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Guidelines for Vaccinat ion of Dogs and Cats ; The 2006 American Association of Feline Practitioners (AA FP) Feline Vaccine Advisory Panel Report ; Ferrets, Rabbits, and Rodents Clinical Medicine and Surgery . The scientific studies and referred journal publications are not available to support all of the vaccination recommendations included within the AAHA and WASVA reports. Some recommendations are based on unpublished studies, current knowledge of immunology, and the experience of experts in the field.17 Furthermore, regarding disaster shelter environments, experience of first responders were taken into co nsideration in deve loping this work group's recommendations. AAHA and WSAVA developed core vaccination recommendations for animals in shelter environments . Additionally, these organization s have developed a list of core and non -core 14 2010 World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Guidelines for Vaccination of Dogs and Cats . 15 Western Veterinary Conference 2011 Proceedin gs, Small Animal Session 169, The View on Vaccines. 16 2010 World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Guidelines for Vaccination of Dogs and Cats . 17 2011 American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) Canine Vaccination Guidelines . Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 31 vaccines for use in household pets under normal and shelter conditions . Core vaccines are defined as vaccines ALL dogs and cats, regardless of circumstances, should receive.18 Under shelter conditions , these organizations have identified the following as core vaccines: Table 4 - AAHA and WSAVA Shelter Core Vaccines Canine Shelter Core Vaccines Feline Shelter Core Vaccines Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) Feline Panleukopenia Virus (FPV) bronchiseptica (Bb) Intranasal Rabies Virus (RV) Non -core vaccines are defined as those that are required by only those animals whose geographical location, local environment or lifestyle places them at risk of contracting specific infections.19 AAFP, AAHA, and WSAVA have identified the following as non -core v accines under normal condi tions: Table 5 - AAHA and WSAVA Non -Core Vaccines Canine Shelter Non -Core Vaccines Feline Shelter Non -Core Vaccines Canine Influenza Virus H3N8 (CIV) WSAVA does not recommend the use of other feline vaccines in shelter situation s. 20 The WSAVA vaccination guidelines group does not recommend the use of other feline vaccines in shelter situations. AAHA has developed a category of vaccines not recommended in shelter environments. AAHA has determined t hese diseases do not represent a significant threat to the population of dogs residing in shelters, would not provide protection because there is inadequate time for immunity to develop, or that have limited efficacy against clinical disease. Among the various canine vaccines licensed fo r use within the US, the following vaccines are not recommended for routine use in shelter -housed dogs : leptospirosis; for the exception); and parenterally administered CPiV. Because most of these vaccines are killed (inactivated) and therefore require two doses at least two ( 2) weeks apart, use of these vaccines is viewed as impractical and u nnecessary in most shelter - housed dogs. 18 2010 World Small A nimal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Guidelines for Vaccination of Dogs and Cats. 19 . Ibid. 20. Ibid. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 32 After reviewing this information, this working group has compiled the following statements and tables as its recommendations on disaster household pet shelter vaccination strategies: See Tables 6-9 for recommended disaster shelter core vaccination strategies of household pets. Variable disaster shelter circumstances make it impractical to provide a universally applicable recommendation list. The tables for recommended disaster shelter core vaccinations strategies m ay be modified by region to include the a ddition of non -core vaccines under regular and shelter circumstances, and include any modifications based on local and state regulations. Consultation and review of vaccination protocols with local and state animal health officials is recommended. With the large number of animals that may arrive at a disaster shelter from a wide geographic region, wide range of household pet lifestyle variations (indoor vs. outdoor, etc.), with mostly undocumented vaccine histories, the unknown duration animals may be residing in a shelter , and the number of people working in the shelter around the animals , it is recommended that all animals (if at the appropriate age) receive a rabies vaccination on intake . It is recommended that all household pets entering a disaster shelter for unknown or long -term sheltering be inoculated with all core vaccines, including rabies vaccine, at the time of admission to the facility re gardless of source (stray vs. surrendered), temperament, physical status, legal status, or final outcome unless the owner provides unambiguous documentation of current vaccination status at the time of admission to a shelter (in this population, there is no reason to revaccinate with canine core vaccines, but feline core vaccines (specifically Feline calicivirus and Feline herpesvirus), may be of value in boosting immunity21), or it is determined that vaccination of the animal is contraindicated due to a medical condition. Unvaccinated animals should not be placed in the general population and should be handled with appropriate biosecurity precautions. This includes fractious animals, feral cats, pregnant animals, and injured or mildly ill animals. In general, if an animal cannot be safely vaccinated because of illness or injury, then it can not safely remain in a shelter.22 Because it can be difficult or impossible to determine whether young dogs (four (4) months of age) have received any vaccines at all, implementation of an initial series (CDV, CPV -2, CAV -2 [IM, SQ], Bb, and CPiV [IN]), beginning as early as four ( 4) weeks of age (as early as 3 -4 weeks of age for IN administered vaccines), may be indicated. Parenterally administered core vaccines should not be administered before six (6) weeks of age. When it is the decision of the facility to initiate the series (i.e., \"puppy shots\") to an individual dog, then the recommended vaccines should be administered at two ( 2) weeks (rather than 3 or 4 w eeks) intervals until the dog reaches >16 weeks of age.23 The CIV vaccine may be recommended (noncore) in selected shelters located within endemic communities or in shelters that transport dogs to or from communities 21 2010 World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Guidelines for Vaccination of Dogs and Cats . 22 2011 American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) Canine Vaccination Guidelines . 23 2011 American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) Canine Vaccination Guidelines. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 33 considered to be endemic for canine influenza. This is a killed vaccine that requ ires two doses be given at least two ( 2) weeks apart. Immunity is expected one ( 1) week after the second dose. Therefore, even in shelters located within endemic communities, the benefit of this vaccine will be limited if exposure cannot be prevented bef ore onset of protection or in dogs unlikely to stay long enough to receive the full series of vaccines. Disaster s helter personnel may be faced with the dilemma of whether to vaccinate a pregnant dog upon admission to a facility. Historically, vaccination during pregnancy has not been recommended in small animal medicine. This is due in part to the paucity of data concerning vaccine safety and efficacy during gestation and the expectation that, in non -immune pregnant bitches, MLV vaccine can caus e fetal d amage or death. When the immunity of the dog is unknown, however, the risk of maternal, fetal, and neonatal infection with field strain virus must be weighed against the risk of vaccination. If non -immune pregnant dogs are likely to be exposed to field s train infection with pathogens such as parvovirus or distemper, serious illness or death of both bitch and fetuses may result. Unless facilities are available to completely isolate them from other dogs, pregnant bitches should either be vaccinated or not remain in the shelter.24 As with pregnant dogs, veterinary medicine has advised against vaccination during illness, due to concerns about suboptimal protection or vaccine -induced illness. The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of a current illness depends on the severity of disease and its etiology. The shelter environment does not usually permit the luxury of isolating dogs and delaying their vaccination until concurrent illness is resolved. Therefore, vaccination is advised upon admissi on for dogs with minor illness (e.g., otitis, dermatitis, upper respiratory tract infection with or without fever) or injuries. Vaccination of dogs with severe signs of disease ideally should be delayed whenever feasible. However, unvaccinated shelter do gs may develop more severe disease if left unvaccinated, and thus would be at greater risk of dying. In the high -risk shelter environment, vaccination of sick dogs with core vaccines should be the rule with very few exceptions.25 See Appendix K for a WSAVA developed frequently asked questions (FAQ) answer sheet regarding vaccine questions and answers on cats and dogs . 24 2011 American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) Canine Vaccination Guidelines . 25 Ibid. Canine Vaccine Recommendations Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 34 Table 6 - Recommended Canine Core Vaccines and Strategies for Disaster Shelters26 Vaccine Initial Vaccination Revaccination (if indicated) Comments CDV + CAV -2 + CPV -2 (Note: Use of a combination CDV vaccine + CAV -2 +CPV -2 vaccine with or without MLV CPiV is recommended. Killed (inactivated) virus vaccines are not recommended. Administer subcutaneous (SQ) or i ntramuscular (IM). Administer a single dose immediately before or at the time of admission to all dogs unless there are veterinary records showing the dog has been vaccinated at 18 -20 weeks of age or older and tested positive for antibody to CDV and CPV -2, it would not be necessary to vaccinate. Minimum age: It is recommended that vaccine not be administered to shelter dogs <4 weeks of age. Puppies ( <18 weeks of age): Revaccination every 2 weeks is recommended until 18 -20 weeks of age. Dogs ( >18-20 weeks of age): Revaccinate at 1 year of age then revaccinate at 3 or more year intervals as for pet animals as long as the dog remains in the facility. When feasible, puppies should be housed separately from adult dogs, regardless of their vaccination sta tus. All MLV -CPV-2 vaccines available today are expected to provide immunity from disease caused by any field variant recognized today (CPV -2a, -2b, and -2c). All current CDV vaccines are expected to provide immunity from disease caused by and of the cur rent variants of th e CDV viruses. Maternally derived antibody (MDA), if present, can interfere with immunization up to 16 -18 weeks of age. When distemper risk is high, inoculation with the recombinant CDV (rCDV) and measles/distemper vaccines have been shown to protect puppies with MDA two (2) weeks earlier than the MLV CDV vaccines. The MLV or rCDV vaccine should be used when dogs are 16 -18 weeks or older, as both are highly effective in t he absence of MDA. Because it is often difficult to know the exact age of puppies and because MDA are often higher in shelter puppies, they may still be sufficient to block immunization at 14 -16 weeks in a small percentage of puppies. Therefore, when fea sible, shelter puppies should receive a final vaccine when estimated to be 18 -20 weeks of age. Once the vaccine has been reconstituted and kept at room temperature, the dose should be administered within one (1) hour to avoid inactivation of the vaccine vi rus, especially the MLV CDV vaccine. Intranasal Bb + (avirulent) Bb + MLV CPiV, vaccine is recommended, with or without CAV -2. Administer IN only. Do not administer SQ or IM. Administer a single dose immedi ately before or at the time of admission. Vaccine can be administered as early as 3 -4 weeks of age (see manufacturer's administration recommendations). Do not administer SQ or IM. Dogs <6 weeks of age: For best results, an additional dose is recommended after 6 weeks of age at a minimum vaccination interval of 2 weeks. Dogs >6 weeks of age: Administer a single intranasal dose every 6 -12 months as indicated. Do not administer SQ or IM. Administration of MLV (avirulent) IN Bb by the SQ or IM route can lead to severe reactions, including death. Onset of protective immunity after initial IN vaccination occurs within 72 hours; vaccines can reduce the severity of the disease but will not entirely prevent canine respiratory disease complex. Use of a trivalen t IN vaccine that also contains a MLV CAV -2 should be considered in shelter -housed dogs when the 2 -way IN fails to provide acceptable protection. 26 Modified from the 2011 American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) Canine Vaccination Guidelines .

Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 39 Nutritional Management After appropriate n utritional assessment has been completed during the physical examination, appropriate nutritional management for each animal is made. The following factors sh ould be utilized to devise appropriate nutritional management:30 Animal Factors 1. Evaluate the animal's condition with respect to the current food intake the owner gave in the intake history. 2. Estimate current energy needs. Resting energy requirements (RER) m ay be estimated using any of a variety of published formulas in the veterinary literature . Food l abel recommendations or a formula may be used as a starting point for energy allowance since energy requirements can vary by 50% in either direction for cats, and by 30% in either direction for dogs (particularly with the maint enance energy requirement (MER)) . The MER depends upon BCS, sex , reproductive status, life stage, activity, and environment variables. 3. Create a monitoring plan. Teach the owner and shel ter staff how to monitor BW, BCS, and/or MCS as appropriate. Adjust intake as needed to match changing needs over time. 4. Adjust or include dietary supplements if necessary, recommending specific types and amounts. 5. A diet change is sometimes necessary. Preferences for and recommendations about diet transition methods vary, with no clear evidence showing any one method is superior. Clinicians should use and recommend techniques based on their individual assessment of client and patient. Some animals tolera te an abrupt change in diet with little problem while others have gastrointestinal upset unless food is gradually changed over a 7 -10 day period. Diet Factors 1. Determine if current amount and type of food is appropriate, based on life stage, lifestyle/activ ity, disease, body condition, concurrent medications and/or medical procedures. 2. If diet factors are determined to be inadequate, prepare a plan for food and treats that provides appropriate calories and nutrient content for the patient. 3. Consider other food sources in total intake recommendations if necessary. 4. Recommend a specific feeding plan that incorporates pet food, treats, feeding method, and frequency. 30 Modified from WSAVA Nutritional Assessment Guidelines Task Force Members: Lisa Freeman, Iveta Becvarova, Nick Cave, Clayton M acKay, Patrick Nguyen, Betina Rama, Gregg Takashima, Ross Tiffin, Hajime Tsjimoto, Peter van Beukelen.

Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 40 Feeding management and environment factors General factors to consider when determining any changes in feeding management and any necessary environmental changes. 1. When creating a feeding schedule, remember to factor in whether the shelter is a stand -alone or co -located shelter; staffing requirements, number of animals currently in the shelter, maximum nu mber of animals that may be taken into the shelter, etc. 2. Whereas some dogs and cats can maintain good body condition when fed free choice, others require meal feeding of appropriate amounts to maintain good body condition. 3. Confirm the use of an appropriate food -measuring device (e.g., an 8 -oz or 237 ml measuring cup), and provide food in measured amounts (whether feeding free choice or meals). 4. Management changes may include provision of feeding toys and reducing conflict and competition for food. 5. Management changes may also include e nvironmental enrichment such as increased opportunities for activity (play, exercise), efforts to decrease perc eived threat s from other animals (including humans) and reducing the frequency of unpredictable change in the animal's environment. Create a plan for hospitalized animals 1. Create a monitoring plan and a feeding plan as discussed under animal factors and diet factors (i.e., diet, route, amount, and frequency). 2. Offer usual and favorite (\"comfort\") foods if at all possible to promote food intake. Avoid introduction of novel foods intended for long -term feeding in order to avoid the risk of inducing an aversion to the diet , especially in cats . A food aversion is avoidance of a food that the animal associates with an aversive experience. 3. The optimal route required to achieve nutrient requirements should be reassessed daily, and may include: a. Voluntary oral feeding ; b. Coax feeding - small changes, such as warming the food, taking the animal to a quiet area for feeding, having the o wner feed the animal, or stroking the animal while eating can enhance food intake; c. Syringe feeding (be careful in animals with any nausea or who are stressed, as this can induce food aversions) . 4. Other nutritional support techniques will be required for ani mals that have not eaten sufficient amounts by the aforementioned routes for 3 -5 days (this includes the time of reduced appetite at home before hospitalization), and are not expected to resume reasonable amounts of food intake prior to further compromise of their nutritional status. a. Use a feeding tube with animals that are not eating adequate amounts voluntarily. Use parenteral nutrition with animals that have gastrointestinal Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 41 dysfunction or in animals where enteral feeding h as increased risk of aspiratio n; b. Evaluate closely and watch for complications associated with the route of nutrition used, particularly with recumbent or n eurologically impaired patients. Create a plan for animals in the general shelter population 1. Create a monitoring plan and a feeding plan as discussed under animal factors and diet factors (i.e., diet, route, amount, and frequency). 2. At co -located shelters, clearly inform the owner of the recommended feeding manage ment factors to insure success. 3. At all shelters, make certain shelter staff are aware of how to monitor that the animals are receiving their food, and eating the offered food. 4. If an animal is obese, appropriate plans to modify the diet should be followed . 5. Create opportunities for staff and owners to: a. Follow up with any ques tions and verify compliance/adherence to recommended feeding management or envi ronment changes; b. Repeat intake examination/assessment on a scheduled basis . Monitoring Healthy animals Adults in good body condition should be reassessed regularly. Decisions r egarding specific frequency of visits are made appropriately on an individual basis, based on the age, species, breed, health, and environment of the pet. Healthy pregnant, lactating, senior, and growing animals require more frequent monitoring. Pet owner s should monitor their pet at home including: Food intake and appetite BCS and BW Gastrointestinal signs (e.g., fecal consistency and volume; vomiting) Overall appearance and activity Animals with disease conditions and/or recommended nutritional changes Non-hospitalized animals for which extended nutritional evaluation was indicated may require more frequent monitoring of nutritional assessment parameters. Frequent monitoring of BCS and MCS is important, as many diseases are associated with suboptimal sco res. Also, animals with medical conditions are more likely to receive dietary supplements and to have medications administered with food, so specific attention to and review of these issues, with an update of the dietary plan, are important at each visit to ensure that the overall nutritional plan is optimized. Animals that are not in optimal body condition require frequent monitoring and adjustment of intake in order to achieve and maintain optimal body condition. Hospitalized patients Daily monitoring o f hospitalized patients includes the above along with: Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 42 Specific feeding orders which include diet, route, amount, and frequency. Fluid balance. Assessment of clinical signs (e.g., body weight changes, pulmonary crackles) or diagnostic tests (e.g., central venous pressure). Addressing optimal route of intake. The optimal route required to achieve nutrient requirements could change during hospitalization and should be reassessed daily (see above). Quantifying and documenting nutrient intake (via all routes). Many hospitalized patients are discharged prior to complete resolution of their underlying disease. Document and communicate to the client the feeding method, caloric intake, diet, frequency and specific monitoring parameters, and the schedule for recheck s and re-assessment. Discuss with the client any issues that may limit adherence to dietary recommendations (e.g., feeding schedule issues, complex instructions, and financial restrictions) and address appropriately (e.g., offer over -the-counter options for appropriate foods if financial restrictions will prevent the owner from consistently feeding the prescribed diet). Create a specific schedule for follow up via telephone to elicit questions and verify compliance/adherence. Provide choices in foods tha t meet nutrient goals. Create a plan with the client about what to do if calorie/nutrient goals are not achieved. When abnormal parameters have returned to normal or stabilized, the patient may continue on a therapeutic diet or be transitioned to a non -therapeutic diet. If a new diet is necessary, it may be introduced gradually, as previously described .

Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 43 Parasite Trea tment and Prophylaxis Internal and external parasites are common in household pets . All animals entering disaster shelters should be treated for species -specific common parasites to protect against illness protect against infestation of the population, prevent environmental contamination, and minimize zoonotic disease risk to shelter staff and the public. A basic parasite control protocol includes prophylactic tr eatment of all dogs and cats at intake for the most common internal and external parasites, including roundworms, hookworms, fleas and ticks. The variable geographic presence of heartworm infection in this country is acknowledged and although diagnosis, control, and treatment presents considerable challenges it is recommended an appropriate heartworm management protocol be implemented when required. Consult with local and state animal health officials to determine heartworm prophylaxis plan if it is requ ired based upon the recommendations from the American Heartworm Society's recommended protocol based for the region affected. For animals that are heartworm positive, follow recommendations from the American Heartworm Society. Pending on shelter hospital capabilities, the cost of treatment, etc. it may not be feasible for a positive animal to be treated at a disaster shelter. Positive household pets may need to be referred to a local animal for treatment with costs associated for the treatment to be work ed out between the owner and the referring clinic. All dogs and cats should be treated with a basic de -wormer for roundworms and hookworms at intake, regardless of source, age, temperament, and health status. The Animal Sheltering Best Practices Working Group guidelines provide information on appropriate sanitation protocols.

The purpose for decontamination is to limit tissue damage and absorption, to prevent systemic poisoning, confine contamination to a specified area, and to prevent secondary contamination to other animals, emerg ency responders, and veterinary hospitals31. Animals that survive natural or manmade disasters or are deployed to disaster regions as part of a disaster response may become contaminated with debris, toxic chemical compounds, or biological pathogens that may pose serious health risks to themselves and/or humans. Large - scale disasters can result in the dispersal of a combination of toxic chemicals and hazardous materials into the environment. The decontamination of animals exposed to the hazards dispersed by natural disasters is an important component of responsible emergency management32. In situations where veterinary or other animal -care personnel are unable to enter the disaster site, communication technologies may allow a veterinarian or other qualified personnel to remotely assist on -scene responders with animal management, decontamination, and triage from an appropriate distance. Decontamination is especially critical to the health and safety of responders at radiation incidents , such as those stemming from the detonation of a nuclear device, and should be a priority. All veterinary hospitals and veterinary disaster response groups should have a written decontamination plan. Contacts should be made with other agencies to ensure cooperation and consistency. Decontamination should occur prior to veterinary examination in most instances in order to protect veterinary responders. It is important to note that advanced training i s required for animal decontamination and typically many veterinarians do not have the necessary hazardous materials (HAZMAT) certifications. Contamination The best way to assure animals and equipment are decontaminated is prevent initial contamination. Responders must have a thorough understanding of what actions or exposures pose a risk of contamination. Chemical and biologic agent exposure may occur by three primary routes: 1. Inhalation/absorption through mucous membranes. Inhaled gases, vapors and ae rosols may be absorbed by any part of the respiratory tract including mucosa of the nasal passages, mouth, airways, and lungs. Due to permeability and surface area along with the direct and systemic effects, especially of chemical agents, this is the rout e most 31 From Wayne Wingfield, Veterinary Decontamination Proce dures, Colorado State University. 32 Soric S, Belanger MP, Wittnich C. A method for decontamination of animals involved in floodwater disasters. J Amer Vet Med Assn 2008; 232(3):364 -370. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 45 likely to cause severe intoxication. There is currently no equipment designed to protect animals from this route of exposure. Protective shelters are under investigation but until available the only means to protect from this route is evacuation o r expedient shelter. 2. Absorption through the skin. Liquid droplets and solid particles which come in contact with skin may be directly absorbed and have both direct and systemic effects. Due to the protective effect of the thick coat and the lower density of sweat glands in canine skin, we expect that animals are inherently less sensitive to cutaneous toxicity from chemical agents. All non -haired portions of the skin, the dense eccrine sweat gland areas of the foot pads and nose, and damaged or inflamed s kin will likely promote absorption of chemical agent. In the horse, sweat glands are prominent over the body in spite of the dense hair coat and absorption of chemical weapons is likely in this species. Animals can only be protected from cutaneous absorp tion by preventing contact with the agent using shelters or evacuation. There is no protective garment for animals. Protection of skin integrity (maintaining healthy skin) and use of skin protectants should help reduce risk of cutaneous absorption. 3. Inge stion. Ingestion of agent may occur due to feeding of contaminated food or water or the animal licking a contaminated surface including its own skin and hair. Ingested agents will have direct effect on the gastrointestinal tract and absorption may result in systemic toxicity. The most important prevention is limiting the animal from being exposed to contaminated food, water, and environments. Safety Requirements for Human Members of Animal Decontamination Teams In keeping with principles outlined in the National Response Framework (NRF) , safety requirements for the human members of any animal decontamination team should be developed by a trained safety officer on site, who is part of the incident command staff responsible for managing all disaster respon se operations and for developing priorities, objectives, and strategies. The safety officer must assess the on -scene hazards and risks to responders and develop appropriate personal safety measures that comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administr ation (OSHA) standards ( www.osha.gov ). The safety officer will develop a medical plan for responders based upon the risk and hazard assessment. Medical Requirements for Personnel All personnel should have appropriate medical and physical clearance prior to performing decontamination protocols. These requ irements are determined by the s afety officer or designated agency. Personnel should receive appropriate prophylaxis when indicated by the S afety Officer against likely biological hazards that may b e present at the disaster site. Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) The s afety officer is responsible for determining the appropriate level of PPE that should be worn by personnel involved in the de contamination protocol. The safety officer must also Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 46 ensure that personnel are properly trained in using PPE and are aware of its limitations. In general, the level of PPE required is determined by a critical assessment of the hazard type s and magnitude. Decontamination Site Layout Local hazardous m aterial teams should be consulted prior to the development of decontamination sites, and admission into these zones will be restricted to trained personnel. In general, h azard sites are traditionally divided into three zones: 1. Hot - Area that contains the hazard ; 2. Warm - Area between the \"hot\" and \"cold\" zones ; 3. Cold - Area free from any hazards . These zones should be clearly marked, and access point to the zones should be monitored to prevent tracking of contam inants from the hot zone into the warm or cold zone. Decontamination procedures should be established before allowing entrance into the contamination area (hot zone) for any reason including rescue. As animals and people exit the hot zone, they must be decontaminated. Decontamination will precede any sort of medical treatment to reduce the spread of contamination. Contaminated equipment (leashes, halters, saddles, etc.) must also be decontaminated as it leaves the hot zone. Decontamination takes place in the warm zone, in what is known as the contamination reduction corridor. The contamination reduction corridor extends from the outer boundary of the hot zone to the point of entry to the cold zone. Thus, entry into the cold zone must always be preced ed by decontamination in the contamination reduction corridor. The cold zone is the location for the medical treatment rooms, animal kennels, and personnel quarters. When selecting a site for animal decontamination, care should be taken to survey the surrounding physical environment. Selection of a decontamination site should be based upon availability, water supply, ability to contain runoff, and the proximity of drains, sewers, streams, and ponds. The site should be on high ground to minimize risk of recurrent flooding. The site must be upwind and uphill from the incident. Wind direction is critical, as the decontamination site should not be situated such that spray mists associated with washing and disinfecting are carried into the animal facility o r personnel quarters in the cold zone. Protection against the sun is important, as excessive exposure can lead to dehydration and heat exhaustion in animals and in handlers wearing PPE. The site should also be a safe distance from the incident but close enough to allow easy access from the hot zone , thus limit ing the spread of contaminants. Patient Decontamination Only personnel with appropriate hazardous materials training should be allowed to participate in animal decontamination operations. In many situations, this may be local hazardous Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 47 materials response teams or fire departments. Some state and federal veterinary response teams have veterinary personnel with hazardous materials training, but local first responders should identify veterina rians, animal control, agricultural agents, and other animal personnel that may respond within their communities during a disaster and help them to obtain the training and certifications that will enable them to participate in animal decontamination operat ions. In general, owners should not decontaminate their own animals. If the owner is also contaminated , it is important that they are effectively decontaminated, something that is less likely to occur if they are instead participating in the decontaminat ion of their animals. In order to provide comfort and reassurance to an animal owner that does not want to become separated from their animal, the owner and animal(s) should be commonly identified before proceeding through the respective decontamination l ines so they can be more easily reunited afterwards. In certain circumstances, it might be possible to decontaminate animals and owners together. We refer the reader to the Decontaminati on Best Practices Working Group report for more detailed information on decontamination. Additional Decontamination Resources: Currance P (ed), 2005.

Veterinary Disaster Medicine . Blackwell. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 48 Euthanasia Euthanasia must be carried out humanely whenever it is indicated. A best practice would be to refer to the current AVMA Euthanasia Guidelines . It is recommended tha t euthanasia be performed in an area separate from the general shelter population , such that no animals will witness the e uthanasia of another animal. Trained personnel should be available to provide counseling as appropriate to owners. Euthanasia protocols may be determined by the ju risdictional authority under which the veterinary response is operating. For example, e uthanasia protocols may include a consensus requirement such that at least two ( 2) veterinarians, or three ( 3) people, including a veterinarian and either an animal beh aviorist or animal control officer are in agreement as to the necessity for euthanasia. Veterinary Medical Euthanasia It is important to establish protocols for euthanasia, including animals with identification for which the owner is unable to be contacted . The protocol must consider the humane ethics and realities of treating each animal in the disaster. The protocol should include p rovisions for when owner contact attempts have been exhausted and the animal 's condition and risk to other animals and staf f members requires timely euthanasia. Thorough written documentation must be generated to support these difficult decisions . Examples of euthanasia forms are supplied in see Appendix N. If an animal is scheduled to be euthanized based on medical issues but has identifiable owner information and attempts to contact the owner have not been exhausted (as determined by the local or state jurisdictional authority ): 1. If the animal is not suffer ing or in pain and does not pose a health or safety risk to other anim als (or humans) in the shelter: a. Place a notification hold on the animal. Follow normal procedures for owner contact. 2. If the animal is not in pain or suffering but is scheduled to be eu thanized based on medical issues to protect the health of other animals in the shelter (for example, if it has been identified as having an infectious disease): a. Consult with a veterinarian to determine whether any isolation and treatment procedures can be employed while attempts are made to contact the owner and establish what time frame would be humane and appr opriate given the circumstances; b. Record all veterinary observations and treatment pres criptions in the animal's log; c. Follow veterinary recommendations regarding isolat ion and treatment or euthanasia; Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 49 d. Attempt to contact the owner. If it was determined by the veterinarian that the animal should be humanely euthanized immediately (prior to contact), the veterinarian, manager, or director sho uld make the contact. 3. If the animal is in pain or suffering but not at the point of death: a. Immediately consult with a veterinarian to determine if palliative measures can be taken while attempts are made to contact the owner and establish what time frame would be humane and appr opriate given the circumstances; b. Record all veterinary observations and treatment pr escriptions in the animal's log; c. Follow veterinary recommendations regarding treatment or euthanasia ; d. Attempt to contact the owner. If it was determ ined by the veterinarian that the animal should be humanely euthanized immediately (prior to contact), the veterinarian, manager, or director should make the contact. 4. If the animal is at the point of death: a. Humanely euthanize the animal; b. Record all observa tions regarding the condition of the animal in the animal's log; c. Attempt to contact the owner. A veterinarian, manager, or director should make the contact. 5. Disposal of animal carcass: a. Best practices include thorough documentation of the euthanasia includ ing a photograph of the deceased animal with a written description of the location, date, time, and animal's identification number in accor dance with state and local laws; b. Method of disposition for animal carcass should be determined by shelter manager afte r discussion with appropriate local or state authorities. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 50 Shelter Biosecurity Considerations Cleaning and disinfection of equipment and surfaces 1. Routine cleaning and disinfection are important for environmental con trol of pathogens; 2. Equipment an d surfaces must be cleaned with water and detergent before they are disinfected because adherent organic material decreases the effec tiveness of most disinfectants; 3. Personnel engaged in cleaning and disinfection should be trained in safe practices and prov ided with necessary safety equipment according to the products' material safety data sheets. Isolation Animals with potentially communicable diseases should be examined, cared for, and housed in designated isolation rooms to protect other patients and vete rinary personnel. Isolation protocols should be prominently posted. Handling of laundry Although soiled laundry may be contaminated with pathogens, the risk of disease transmission is negligible if soiled items are handled correctly. Decontamination and spill response Spills and splashes of vomitus, body fluids, or potentially infective substances should be immediately contained with absorbent material. Veterinary medical waste Medical waste is defined and regulated at the state level by multiple agencies . Veterinary medical waste may include sharps, tissues, contaminated materials, and dead animals. Shelter managers should work with local and state animal health authorities to determine proper disposal of veterinary medical waste material generated by the response effort. Rodent and Vector Control Field veterinary personnel and animal responders have the greatest risk for exposure to vectors and should use repellents and protective clothing. Integrated pest management is the recommended approach to control rodents and vectors in veterinary medical buildings. A comprehensive rodent and vector contro l plan that includes environmental control measures as follows: Sealing of potential entry and exit points into buildings with caulk, steel wool, or metal lath; Storage of food and garbage in metal or thick -plastic containers with tight lids; Disposal of f ood waste promptly; Elimination of potential rodent nesting sites (e.g., clutter); Remove sources of standing water (e .g., empty buckets, tires, and clogged gutters) to reduce po tential mosquito breeding sites; Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 51 Installation and maintenance of window screen s to preve nt entry of insects and rodents. Other environmental controls It is important to provide a staff break room or area for eating and drinking. Separate, appropriately labeled refrigerators should be used for human food, animal food, and biologics. Dishware for human use should be washed and stored away from animal care areas.

Immunizations recommended by the CDC include: Tetanus: In accordance with the current CDC guidelines, responders should receive a tetanus booster if they have not been vaccinated for tetanus during the past 10 years. Td (tetanus/diphtheria) or Tdap (tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis) can be used; getting the Tdap formula for one tetanus booster during adulthood is recommended to maintain protection against pertussis . While documentation of vaccination is preferred, it should not be a requisite to work. Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B vaccine series for persons who will be performing direct patient care or otherwise expected to have contact with bodily fluids. According t o the CDC there is no indication for the following vaccines for disaster responders in the United States. However, these additional vaccinations may be recommended by local health authorities: Hepatitis A vaccine (low probability of exposure). Vaccinatio n will take at least one to two weeks to provide substantial immunity. Typhoid vaccine (low probability of exposure). Cholera vaccine (low probability of exposure, no licensed cholera vaccine available in the U.S.). Meningococcal vaccine (no expectation of increased risk of meningococcal disease among emergency responders). Pre-exposure r abies vaccine series (the full series is required for protection) for disaster veterinary medical personal and others who may be handling animals and are at risk as many an imals brought into shelters have an unknown vaccination history. Persons who are exposed to potentially rabid animals should be evaluated and receive standard post -exposure prophylaxis, as clinically appropriate.33 A few points to mention on responder vac cinations: In the majority of cases, volunteers are responsible for covering the costs of their vaccinations. Exceptions were state responders in Florida and Mississippi, who offered limited vaccinations (Hepatitis and tetanus) to their animal first respo nders.34 International responders will need to adhere to the vaccination guidelines of the responding organization and the region they are being deployed. The following list serves as a guideline. 33 Content Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/responderimmun.asp ) Immunization Recommendations for disaster responders. 34 E-mail correspondence with animal health officials in Florida and M ississippi in 2010.

May I give a MLV product to a wild, exotic species or to a domestic species other than to the ones which the vaccine was licensed to protect? No, never give MLV vaccines unless they have been shown to be safe in that species. Many MLV vaccines have caused disease in animal species other than those for which they had been licensed. Even worse: the vaccine could be shed from the wild animals, regain virulence through multiple passages and cause disease even in the target species for which it had been developed. The consequences could be catastrophic! A highly effective and very safe vaccine for species that are susceptible to CDV is a canary poxvirus -vectored recombinant CDV vaccine that is available as a monovalent product for ferrets or a combination product for dogs. The monovalent vaccine is being used in many wild and exotic species susceptible to CDV, but is only available in c ertain countries. 2. May I vaccinate a puppy that is at high risk of getting CDV with a human measles vaccine? No. Due to an insufficient amount of virus, the human MV vaccine is not immunogenic in the puppy. Measles virus vaccines made specifically for the dog (sometimes combined with CDV and additional viral components) will give temporary protection at an earlier age than a CDV vaccine. At 16 weeks or older, the puppy must be vaccinated with a CDV vaccine, to achieve permanent immunity. 3. Can certa in vaccines immunize pups having maternally derived antibody (MDA) against CDV at an earlier age than the conventional MLV CDV vaccines? Yes. The heterotypic measles vaccine for dogs will immunize pups about 4 weeks earlier than the MLV -CDV vaccines. Simi larly, the canary pox vectored recombinant CDV vaccine will immunize approximately 4 weeks earlier than the MLV vaccines. 4. I know that maternally derived antibodies (MDA) can prevent active immunization with MLV vaccines - but can they also block immuni ty to killed vaccines? Yes. MDA can indeed block certain killed vaccines. If the killed product requires two doses, as is often the case, and the first dose is blocked by MDA, then the second dose will not immunize. In this circumstance, the second dose will prime (if not blocked), and a third dose is required to immunize and boost. 35 Journal of Small Animal Practice Vol . 51 June 2010 \u00a9 2010 WSAVA Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 84 This is not true for MLV, where - in the absence of MDA - it only takes a single dose to prime, immunize, and boost. Nevertheless two doses are often recommended, particularl y in young animals, to be sure one is given when MDA cannot block. That is why in the puppy or kitten series, the last dose should be given at around 16 weeks of age or later. 5. I have been told that certain canine MLV combination core products need onl y be given twice, with the last dose at an age as young as 10 weeks. Is that accurate? The VGG is aware that certain canine vaccines are licensed for such an 'early finish' in order to allow pups the benefit of early socialization. The VGG accepts the behavioral benefits of this practice but has reservations about its immunological validity. No combination core product currently available will immunize an acceptable percentage of puppies when the last dose is given at 10 weeks of age. The VGG advises that wherever possible the last dose should be given at around 16 weeks of age, regardless of the number of doses given earlier. Where the 'early finish' protocol is adopted, the VGG recommends that owners carefully control the exposure of their pup to re stricted environments and only permit contact with healthy and fully vaccinated puppies. 6. May I give the same type of vaccine parenterally and intranasally, for example the canine and feline vaccines used to prevent respiratory diseases ('kennel cough' and feline upper respiratory disease)? Yes. However, you should be sure to give the product approved for that route. If you use the parenteral MLV vaccines containing FCV and FHV -1 locally, you could cause disease in the cat. If you use the killed FCV a nd FHV -1 vaccines locally, you would not get any immunity and might cause significant adverse reactions. If you gave the intranasal live 'kennel cough' vaccine parenterally, you could cause a severe necrotizing local reaction and even kill the dog, wherea s giving the parenteral killed Bordetella vaccine intranasally will not immunize and may cause a hypersensitivity reaction. However, both types of products can be given at the same time or at various times in the life of the animal. Vaccinating both pare nterally and intranasally may actually provide better immunity than vaccinating at only one site. Thus parenteral vaccination provides protection in the lung but little or no immunity in the upper respiratory tract (especially local secretory IgA and CMI) , whereas intranasal vaccination will engender good secretory IgA and local CMI and non -specific immunity (e.g. type I interferons), but will not always provide immunity in the lung. 7. How long after vaccination does it take for the dog to develop immunity that will prevent severe disease when the core vaccines are used? This is dependent on the animal, the vaccine and the disease. The fastest immunity is provided by CDV vaccines - MLV and recombinant canary pox virus vectored. The immune response starts within minutes to hours Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 85 and provides protection within a day to animals without interfering levels of MDA and dogs that are not severely immunosuppressed. Immunity to CPV -2 and FPV develops after as few as 3 days and is usually present by 5 days whe n an effective MLV vaccine is used. In contrast, the killed CPV-2 and FPV vaccines often take 2 to 3 weeks or longer to provide protective immunity. CAV-2 MLV given parenterally would provide immunity against CAV -1 in 5 -7 days. However, when given intran asally the same level of immunity to CAV -1 is not present until after 2 or more weeks and in some dogs it doesn't develop. Thus parenteral CAV -2 is recommended for immunity to CAV -1. Time from vaccination to immunity is difficult to determine for FCV and FHV-1 because some animals will not develop protective immunity. However, when it does develop, it takes 7 -14 days. 8. What can I expect from the core vaccines in terms of efficacy in the properly vaccinated puppy/dog and kitten/cat? Dogs properly vaccin ated with MLV or recombinant CDV, CPV -2 and CAV -2 would have 98% protection from disease. Similarly we would expect a very high protection from infection. For the properly vaccinated cat that had received MLV vaccines, we would estimate that 98% would b e protected from disease and infection with FPV. In contrast, we can expect FCV and FHV -1 vaccines, at best, to protect from disease, not infection, especially in a highly contaminated environment (e.g. shelter) and protection would be seen in 60 to 70% in a high risk environment. Protection would appear to be much higher in the household pet cat isolated from other cats or with cats that have been vaccinated and in the household for a long time because the risk for infection with the viruses is so much lo wer, as is the stress level. 9. Are there mutants (biotypes or variants) of CDV or CPV -2 in the field that the current vaccines cannot provide protective immunity against? No. All of the current CDV and CPV -2 vaccines provide protection from all the known isolates of CDV or CPV -2, respectively, when tested experimentally as well as in the field. 10. Do the current CPV -2 vaccines provide protection from disease caused by the new variant CPV -2c? How long does the protection last? Yes. The CPV -2 vacci nes, regardless of what variant they contain, stimulate an active immune response (e.g. antibody response), that provides long term (4 or more years) protection from all current CPV -2 variants (2a, 2b, and 2c) when the dogs are challenged. 11. Can parvovi rus vaccines (e.g. canine parvovirus -2 and feline parvovirus (panleukopenia) ) be administered orally? Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 86 No. CPV-2 and FPV vaccines, when given orally, will not immunize. They will immunize when given intranasally, however the most effective route is parent eral (subcutaneous or intramuscular) vaccination. 12. Can certain CPV -2 vaccines immunize pups with MDA at an earlier age than other CPV-2 vaccines? Yes. Certain CPV -2 vaccines with higher viral titers and/or with more immunogenic isolates (regardless of variant) will immunize a few weeks (e.g. 2 weeks) earlier than other CPV -2 vaccines. 13. Are serum antibody titers useful in determining vaccine immunity? Yes. This is particularly the case for CDV, C PV-2 and CAV -1 in the dog, FPV in the cat and rabies virus in the cat and dog. Serum antibody titers are of limited or no value for the other vaccines. Assays for CMI are of little or no value for any of the vaccines for various technical and biological reasons. Such factors are less of an issue for serological tests where it is much easier to control many of the variables. However, discrepant results are still obtained, depending on the quality assurance program of the given laboratory. 14. When a Leptospira vaccine (bacterin) is used, should it be a product with two serovars or one with more than two serovars (e.g. four serovars)? When a Leptospira vaccine is used in high risk dogs, the commercial vaccine that contains all the serovars that cause d isease in the dog in that region, if available, should be used. Always use a product that provides protection against all the important serovars. In the United States , the four serovars responsible for most, if not all, cases of leptospirosis are canicol a, icterohaemorrhagiae, pomona and grippotyphosa. Therefore, the four component product is recommended. In many other countries there is insufficient knowledge of which serovars are circulating in the canine population. The VGG would encourage collectio n of such data. 15. Do Leptospira vaccines give long term (e.g. years) immunity and are they highly effective, like the core viral vaccines? No. Leptospira vaccines provide short -term immunity (e.g. 3 -12 months) and the efficacy is often less than 70%. Also Leptospira products often prevent clinical disease but fail to protect against infection and shedding of the bacteria, especially when infection occurs more than 6 months after vaccination. The immunity among the serovars varies and immunity varies a mong vaccinated dogs. Persistence of antibody after vaccination will often be only a few months and immunological memory for protective immunity is short (e.g. 1 year or less). Thus, revaccination may be required as often as every 6 -9 months for dogs at high risk. 16. Do any feline leukemia virus vaccines (e.g. killed adjuvanted, subunit, recombinant) provide protection with only one dose of vaccine? Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 87 No. All feline leukemia virus vaccines require a minimum of two doses of vaccine. The two doses should p referably be given 2 -4 weeks apart, starting at 8 weeks of age or older. Only after that initial series of two vaccines can you then give a single dose to boost the response. When the interval between the initial two doses exceeds 6 weeks or more, it is r ecommended that the cat be revaccinated, making certain that two doses be given at an interval of 2 -4 weeks. 17. Do cats need to be revaccinated with FeLV vaccines more often than every 3 years after they have received the kitten vaccine and a booster at one year? No. Revaccination more often than every 3 or more years is not necessary and annual revaccination can increase the development of injection site sarcomas, when adjuvanted vaccines are used. 18. Why don't I have the FIV vaccine in my country? The availability of vaccines is generally determined by the manufacturer and the local or regional licensing authority on the basis of scientific knowledge pertaining to the local disease situation (and marketing considerations). The current FIV vaccine con tains two clades (subtypes) of FIV (A and D) and although cross -protection against other clades is claimed there are geographical differences in the clades of virus circulating in a particular country. There also remain issues with the potential for this vaccine to interfere with serodiagnostic testing for FIV infection. Cats given FIV vaccine should be tested for serum antibody before vaccination and identified with a microchip. 19. Can a microchipped cat vaccinated with FIV vaccine be infected with FIV ? Yes. Vaccine will not prevent infection and latency for all subtypes of FIV, thus FIV vaccinated cats can also be infected and act as a source of virus for susceptible cats. 20. Will the current 'kennel cough' vaccines provide any protection from disea se caused by the new canine influenza virus (CIV)? No. The racing greyhounds that have been found infected and that developed disease had been routinely vaccinated 3 or more times a year with commercial 'kennel cough' vaccines. CIV is antigenically unrela ted to any other virus of dogs, but related to Equine Influenza Virus (H3N8). A new CIV vaccine has been conditionally licensed in the USA and is recommended for at -risk dogs. 21. Is there a vaccine available to aid in the prevention of disease caused by canine influenza virus (CIV)? Yes. There is a new vaccine recently licensed (conditionally) in the USA that is designed to aid in the prevention of influenza in dogs caused by the H3N8 virus. The product is an adjuvanted killed vaccine that, like all ki lled vaccines, requires two initial doses given 2 - 4 weeks apart. The efficacy and duration of immunity of this CIV vaccine or others that may be developed in the future will be determined in the next few years as information accumulates in the field. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 88 22. Are there vaccines available for dogs and/or cats that are not designed to prevent infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi/yeasts and/or parasites? Yes. There are vaccines that are used to prevent conception, and to aid in the prevention of death from snakebites with certain species of snakes, and to aid in the treatment of melanomas in dogs. Furthermore, additional canine and feline vaccines are being developed that are not designed to prevent infectious diseases. 23. Can nosodes (holisti c preparations) be used to immunize pets? No. Nosodes cannot be used for the prevention of any disease. They do not immunize because they do not contain antigen. QUESTIONS RELATED TO VACCINATION PROCEDURE 24. May I mix different types of vaccines in th e syringe? No. One should never mix different vaccine preparations in the syringe unless specified by the data sheet. 25. May I co -inject different vaccines (not part of a single commercial product) into the same animal? Yes. However, different vaccines should be injected into separate sites that are drained by different lymph nodes. 26. May I use smaller vaccine doses in small breeds to reduce the risk of adverse reactions? No. The volume (e.g. 1.0 ml) as recommended by the manufacturer generally repr esents the minimum immunizing dose, therefore the total amount must be given. 27. Should the large dog (Great Dane) be injected with the same volume of vaccine as the small dog (Chihuahua)? Yes. Unlike pharmaceuticals that are dose -dependent, vaccines ar e not based on volume per body mass (size), but rather on the minimum immunizing dose. 28. May I vaccinate the anaesthetized patient? It is best not to do this if possible as the patient may develop a hypersensitivity reaction and vomit, leading to an increased risk of aspiration. Also, anesthetic agents may be immunomodulatory. 29. May I vaccinate pregnant pets? No. Vaccination with MLV and killed products during pregnancy should be avoided, if at all possible. There are exceptions, especially in s helters, where vaccination would be advised if the pregnant animal has never been vaccinated and there is an outbreak of disease (e.g. CDV or FPV). Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 89 30. Does immunosuppressive glucocorticoid treatment in the cat or dog interfere with core vaccine immunity d uring the primary or secondary (booster) vaccination programs? Studies of both species suggest that immunosuppressive glucocorticoid treatment prior to or concurrently with vaccination does not have a significant suppressive effect on antibody production to the vaccines. However, revaccination is recommended several weeks (2 or more) after glucocorticotherapy therapy has ended, especially when treatment occurred during administration of the initial series of core vaccines. 31. May I vaccinate pets that are on immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy (other than glucocorticoids) (e.g. for cancer or autoimmune diseases)? No. Vaccination especially with MLV products should be avoided as they may cause disease; vaccination with killed p roducts may not be effective or may aggravate the immune -mediated disease. 32. How long after stopping immunosuppressive therapy do I wait before revaccinating a pet? A minimum of 2 weeks. 33. May I vaccinate every week if an animal is at high risk of di sease? No. Vaccines should not be given more often than every other week, even when different vaccines are being given. 34. When should the last vaccine dose be given in the puppy and kitten vaccine series? The last dose of vaccine should be given at 14-16 weeks of age or older. 35. May I inject a killed vaccine, followed at a later time with a MLV for the same disease? No. The killed vaccine may induce an effective antibody response that will neutralize the MLV in the vaccine, thereby preventing imm unization. It would be preferable to give the MLV vaccine first and if/when needed, revaccinate with the killed vaccine preparation. 36. May I inject a modified live intranasal Bordetella vaccine? No. The vaccine can cause a severe local reaction and may even kill the pet by causing systemic disease (e.g. liver failure). 37. May I give a killed Bordetella vaccine destined for parenteral use intranasally? No. This will not stimulate a protective response to the Bordetella , but may cause a hypersensitivit y response; you should give a live vaccine via the intranasal route, as specified by the data sheet. 38. Are precautions necessary when using MLV FHV -1/FCV parenteral vaccines in cats? Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 90 Yes. Mucosal (e.g. conjunctival and nasal) contact with the preparati on must be avoided, because the vaccine virus can cause disease. 39. May I use different vaccine brands (manufacturers) during the vaccination program? Yes. It may even be desirable to use vaccines from different manufacturers during the life of an anima l, because different products may contain different strains (e.g. of feline calicivirus). 40. Should I use a disinfectant (e.g. alcohol) on the injection site? No. The disinfectant might inactivate an MLV product and it is not known to provide a benefit. 41. May I split vaccines in combination products? Yes. For example, Leptospira bacterins are often used as the diluent for the viral antigen combination. The 'viral cake' may be resuspended in sterile water or buffered saline, and the Leptospira bacterin be given separately at another site or time, or discarded. 42. Will a single vaccine dose provide any benefit to the dog or cat? Will it benefit the canine and feline populations? Yes. One dose of a MLV canine core vaccine (CDV, CPV -2 CAV -2) or a feline core vaccine (FPV, FCV, FHV -1) should provide long term immunity when given to animals at or after 16 weeks of age. Every puppy and kitten 16 weeks of age or older must receive at least one dose of the MLV core vaccines. If that were done, herd ( population) immunity would be significantly improved. Even in the USA with its good vaccination record, probably <50% of all puppies and <25% of all kittens ever receive a vaccine. We must vaccinate more animals in the population with core vaccines to achi eve herd immunity (e.g. 75% or higher) and prevent epidemic outbreaks. 43. When an animal first receives a vaccine that requires two doses to immunize (e.g. killed vaccines like Leptospira bacterins or feline leukemia virus), and it does not return for th e second dose within 6 weeks, is there any immunity? No. A single dose of a two -dose vaccine does not provide immunity. The first dose is for priming the immune system, the second for immunizing. If a second dose is not given within 6 weeks of the firs t, the regime should start again, making sure the two doses are given within 2 -6 weeks. After those two doses, revaccination with a single dose can be done at yearly or greater intervals to boost the response. 44. For how long can a reconstituted MLV vaccine sit at room temperature without losing activity? Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 91 At room temperature, some of the more sensitive vaccines (e.g. CDV, FHV -1) will lose their ability to immunize in 2 -3 hours, whereas other components will remain immunogenic for several days (e.g. CP V, FPV). The VGG recommends that MLV vaccines, after being reconstituted, should be used within 1 -2 hrs. 45. If an animal has gone beyond the time that is generally considered to be the minimum DOI for the core vaccine (7 to 9 years for CDV, CPV -2, CAV -2; 7 years for FPV, FCV, FHV -1), do I have to start the series of vaccinations again (multiple doses 2 -4 weeks apart)? No. For MLV vaccines, multiple doses are only required at the puppy or kitten age, when an animal has MDA. The VGG is aware that many da ta sheets do advise re - starting a vaccination series, but does not endorse this practice which is inconsistent with fundamental immune system function and the principles of immunological memory. 46. Should I vaccinate a cat infected with FeLV and/or FIV i nfection? A FeLV or FIV positive cat that is clinically well would ideally be housed indoors away from other cats to minimize the risk of exposure to infectious disease. However, if it were deemed necessary to vaccinate with core components (FPV, FCV and FHV-1) this should be done with killed (not MLV) vaccines. Such cats should not be vaccinated against FeLV or FIV. A FeLV or FIV positive cat with clinical illness should not be vaccinated. In some countries there is a legal requirement for rabies vaccin ation that would also include infected cats. 47. Where should I inject vaccine into a cat? Feline vaccines (particularly adjuvanted products) should not be given into the inter - scapular region. In the USA the practice of giving separate injections of rabies vaccine into the distal right hind limb and FeLV vaccine into the distal left hind limb has been practiced. Alternative sites for subcutaneous injection are over the lateral thoracic or abdominal wall. Of these, the abdominal wall represents the s ite from which an injection site sarcoma is most readily resected surgically and is the site recommended by the VGG. Whichever site is chosen, the vaccine must be administered subcutaneously and not intramuscularly. Importantly, the anatomical site of fel ine vaccination should be rotated so that vaccines are not given repeatedly to one location. This may be achieved by recording the site of vaccination for each individual on each occasion and rotating between these, or by adopting a practice policy to use one anatomical location each year. 48. Does severe nutritional deficiency affect the immune response to vaccines? Yes. It has been shown that certain severe deficiencies of vitamins and trace minerals (e.g. Vitamin E/Se) can interfere with the developme nt of a protective immune response in puppies. Known or suspected nutritional deficiencies should be corrected by Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 92 appropriate nutritional supplementation and the animals should be revaccinated to ensure there is adequate protective immunity. 49. If a puppy or kitten fails to receive colostrum will they have any passive antibody protection from the dam? Depending on the antibody titre of the dam they will have little or, most likely, no protection as approximately 95% or more of the passive antibody for the newborn puppy and kitten is obtained from the colostrum which is absorbed via the intestine into systemic circulation for up to 72 hours after birth. 50. Should a puppy or kitten that fails to receive colostrum be vaccinated during the first few week s of life since they will not have maternally derived antibody to block active immunization? No. Puppies and kittens less than 4 -6 weeks of age should not be vaccinated with the MLV core vaccines. Certain of the modified live vaccine viruses when given t o pups/kittens less than 2 weeks of age and without MDA can infect the central nervous system and/or cause disease and possibly death of the animal. This occurs because there is little or no thermoregulatory control of body temperature during the first week or more after birth, thus innate and adaptive immunity is significantly impaired. 51. How can these colostrum -deprived young animals be protected from the core diseases? Artificial colostrum can be fed if the puppy or kitten is less than 3 days old a nd has never been fed a protein diet. Artificial colostrum (AC) is 50% milk replacer (e.g. EsbilacTM or other similar product) and 50% immune serum (preferably from the dam or other well vaccinated animal living in the same environment as the dam). If pup s or kittens have received protein (e.g. milk replacer) orally or are 3 days of age or older, serum from a well immunized adult animal can be given subcutaneously or intraperitoneally or citrated plasma can be given intravenously. Depending on size of the animal, approximately 3 to 10 ml of serum or plasma should be administered twice daily for up to 3 days. QUESTIONS RELATED TO ADVERSE REACTIONS TO VACCINES 52. Is there a risk of over -vaccinating a pet (e.g. injecting it too often, or using vaccines that are not required for the specific pet)? Yes. Vaccines should not be given needlessly, as they may cause adverse reactions. Vaccines are medical products that should be tailored to the needs of the individual animal. Also, when administering bacterins it is advisable to give them at separate times rather than giving them together. Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 93 53. Are certain vaccines or combinations of vaccines more likely to cause adverse reactions than others? Yes. Although the development of an adverse reaction is often depen dent on the genetics of the animal (e.g. small breed dogs or families of dogs), certain vaccines have a higher likelihood of producing adverse reactions, especially reactions caused by Type I hypersensitivity. For example, bacterins (killed bacterial vacc ines), such as Leptospira , Bordetella, Borrelia and Chlamydophila are more likely to cause these adverse reactions than MLV viral vaccines. 54. Should dogs and cats with a history of adverse reaction or immune -mediated diseases (hives, facial edema, anaph ylaxis, injection site sarcoma, autoimmune disease etc.) be vaccinated? If the vaccine suggested to cause the adverse reaction is a core vaccine, a serological test can be performed and if the animal is found to be seropositive (antibody to CDV, CPV-2, FPV ) revaccination is not necessary. If the vaccine is an optional non -core vaccine (e.g. Leptospira or Bordetella bacterin) revaccination is discouraged. For rabies, the local authorities must be consulted to determine whether the rabies vaccine is to be administered by law or whether antibody titer may be determined as an alternative. If vaccination is absolutely necessary then switching product (manufacturer) may be helpful. Hypersensitivity reactions are known to be related to excipients contained within the vaccine (e.g. traces of bovine serum albumin used in the virus culture process). The use of antihistamines pre -revaccination is acceptable and does not interfere with the vaccinal immune response. Revaccinate d susceptible animals should be closely monitored for up to 24 hours post -vaccination although such reactions (Type 1 hypersensitivity) generally occur within minutes of exposure. Other types of hypersensitivity (II, III, IV) can occur much later (e.g. ho urs to months). 55. Can vaccines cause autoimmune diseases? Vaccines themselves do not cause autoimmune disease, but in genetically predisposed animals they may trigger autoimmune responses followed by disease - as can any infection, drug, or a variety of other environmental factors. 56. How common are adverse reactions to vaccines? There is no definitive answer to this question as it is difficult to obtain accurate data. Determining the frequency of adverse reactions relies upon the veterinarian or owne r reporting such reactions to the manufacturer or national authority (where such routes exist). It is currently accepted that the vaccines that we use are very safe with a very low incidence of possible side effects. The benefits of protection from serio us infectious disease far outweigh the risks of developing an adverse reaction. Recent analysis of a major US hospital group database has allowed publication of data based on very large numbers of vaccinated dogs and cats. Adverse reactions (of any kind, including very minor reactions) were documented within the first 3 days following vaccination in 38 of 10,000 vaccinated dogs. Adverse reactions (of any kind, including very minor reactions) Disaster Veterinary Care : Best Practices Page 94 were documented within the first 30 days following vaccination in 52 of 10,000 vaccinated cats. However, many other animals had reactions that were not reported to the practice, but were reported to other practices or emergency practices where the animal was seen. Some breeds and families of pets will have a much hi gher evidence of adverse reactions than the general population of animals. 57. Are there dogs and cats that cannot develop an immune response to vaccines? Yes. This is a genetic characteristic seen particularly in some breeds, and these animals are called 'non -responders'. Genetically related (same family or same breed) animals will often share this non -responsiveness. If the animal is a non -responder to a high ly pathogenic agent, like canine parvovirus or feline panleukopenia virus, the infected animal may die if infected. If it is a nonresponder to a pathogen that rarely causes death, it may become sick but will survive (e.g. after a Bordetella bronchiseptica infection). 58. Do puppies develop immunosuppression after the initial series of core vaccines? Yes. If a combination product containing MLV -CDV and MLV -CAV-2 with other components is used, a period of immunosuppression lasting approximately 1 week deve lops, beginning 3 days after vaccination. If the combination vaccine does not contain either MLV -CDV or MLV -CAV-2, then such suppression does not occur. 59. What can be done to avoid the immunosuppression in puppies, as all should receive the core vaccin es (CDV, CPV -2, CAV -2)? The puppies could receive a bivalent vaccine containing CDV and CPV -2 parenterally and the CAV -2 could be given later or given intranasally as part of a vaccine for kennel cough that also contains B. bronchiseptica and canine parain fluenza. You could also use a combination vaccine containing canary pox vectored CDV and MLV CPV -2 and CAV -2 vaccines, as this combination does not cause immunosuppression. 60. Is the immune response to Leptospira responsible for causing a hypersensitivi ty response in certain dogs also short lived (e.g. <1 year), like immunity from infection? No. Unlike immunity and IgG memory, which are relatively short lived (1 year), memory for immediate hypersensitivity, as determined by skin testing, is long lived ( 4 years).
