They play a primary care role in healthcare, notwithstanding the legally limited purview of their clinical and public health roles. This mainstream position came their way through biomedicalization that occurred in the profession in the context of the country's private sector-led health system. Based on data gathered among KMDs and in state-level policymaking scenes as an insider, this paper aims to illustrate the characteristics of KMDs' identity by attending to multiple levels of their presence as modern medical profession. In doing so, it draws on works that explored medical identity, Simon Sinclair's (1997) Making Doctors: An Institutional Apprenticeship in particular, to show that despite their similarities to biomedical practitioners, KMDs exhibit discriminating characteristics in their professional consciousness. Korean medicine, Doctors of Korean Medicine, medical identity, biomedicalization, East Asian medicine, Simon Sinclair Introduction [1](#f1) The Doctors of Korean Medicine\u2014or KMDs (hanisa in Korean)\u2014are physicians in South Korea practicing traditional East Asian medicine (EAM). This medical tradition has its origin traced back to Han China [End Page 165] (202 B.C.E.-220 C.E.). Their practice is mostly similar to that by traditional medicine practitioners in mainland China and practitioners in Japan, as they take a pulse, check the tongue and palpate the abdomen to diagnose, and apply acupuncture needles and prescribe herbal decoctions for treatment. Among the differences that exist, what distinguishes KMDs from their counterparts would be their reliance on two local EAM classics, Dongibogam and Dongisusebown. KMDs are modern standard-bearers of this tradition, striving to give perfection to their medicine against the odds set by biomedical practitioners and their favoring by the state. My argument in this paper is that this commonsensical\u2014and factual on an important level\u2014view of KMDs cannot be the full guide for those exploring their professional identity. It is because the view, with the presupposition that the majority of what constitutes their professional consciousness is their connection with the local tradition, makes one fail to perceive important elements in the process of their professionalization, namely biomedicalization and its effects. Based upon data I gathered during long-term fieldwork in the KMDs' community as an insider and from auto-ethnographic sources available to me as the holder of a KMD license with additional anthropological training, [2](#f2) this paper aims to reveal aspects of their identity that have been relatively neglected. To clarify designations, the term \"Korean Medicine\" refers to what is practiced by its contemporary practitioners, or \"Doctors of Korean Medicine\" who are variably styled within the profession as \"KMD,\" \"DKM,\" or \"MD\" (DKM). The term \"East Asian medicine\" (EAM) will be used as an umbrella term to designate the pan-East Asian historical medical tradition practitioners in this region have inherited. \"Biomedicine\" or \"Western medicine\" (WM) will be used interchangeably to refer to the medicine originating in the West, which became the dominant force since its scientific developments in late-nineteenth century and through colonial expansion. \"MDs\" will be used to designate Korean doctors who practice this Western form of medicine, whereas the term \"biomedical practitioners\" will be used to refer to practitioners of this medicine in general. All translations are by the author and where necessary, brackets and italics are added. Parentheses, however, are in the original. Professional Challenges as Epistemic Challenges To understand the deeper implications of the Zapatistas uprising against the North American Free Trade Agreement in Chiapas, Mexico and the [End Page 166] Battle of Seattle anti-globalization movement, [Icaza and V\u00e1zquez (2013)](#b14) offer that these struggles should not just be seen as a reaction to the forces unleashed by the existing structure of oppression, but as events that challenge \"the epistemic hegemony\" ( [Icaza and V\u00e1zquez, 2013:7](#b14)). They propose that social struggles would be better understood when investigated as epistemic struggles, because social struggles question the dominant worldview or \"dominant way of thinking and ordering of the real\" ( [Icaza and V\u00e1zquez, 2013:7](#b14)). As a KMD who has seen professional challenges throughout his career, I agree with their conceptualization because for every challenge involving a KMD, there have always been elements of an epistemic challenge. Rather, epistemic ones came first before being interpreted and understood as professional ones. The following remark offered by a junior KMD during fieldwork, given upon my request to elucidate what she thought was the biggest source of frustration among her generation, exemplifies the features of this epistemic dimension that KMDs experience in their professional challenge. At that time, there was a vast inter-generational conflict within the community which I was gathering data from, and she offered this to throw a spotlight on fatalistic statements regarding their profession that emerged among her cohort in a KMD-only online community: Some of them are angry because of their passion for the discipline. If you see other fields such as mathematics, people could say about the [grim] career prospect of being a mathematician or [academic] difficulties of solving mathematical problems, but nobody who doesn't know about mathematics would give a sweeping remark that mathematics is a trash. But think about Korean medicine, it's a daily occurrence that Korean medicine is accused and blamed ... Most of us who came to KM school scored much higher exam scores than was necessary to enter WM schools. We have high self-esteem, so they couldn't bear the constant accusations that face them. In this statement we see how the lack of epistemic authority granted to EAM concepts whose veracity she dearly holds affects her deepest sense of professional self-esteem. In this epistemic and social geography of professional politics surrounding KMDs, it would be not surprising to encounter the divide within their community established along the EAM-biomedicine fault-line. In a meeting I attended during fieldwork, for example, an occasion of its division was witnessed among KM academics during their decision-making regarding the standard translation of EAM terms. In general, the classic scholars chose words based on EAM heritage, while the clinicians opted for their biomedicalized version. A short clash [End Page 167] over daemaong ()\u2014mundungbyng, the Korean word for leprosy, on one side and Hansen's Disease on the other\u2014led to an hour of heated arguments concerning the pronunciation of one word denoting the contraction of limbs, showing the extent to which epistemic tensions characterize KMD's professional life. The word in contention was \"\" and a classics professor preferred the part \"\" to be pronounced as hyuk since it denotes \"pulling,\" whereas a clinical professor argued for the part to be pronounced as ch'uk because he believed that only by doing so the word correctly conveys clinical manifestations of involuntary muscle spasm, as in ynch'uk (). This tension is visible to both insiders and outsiders, that is, while being manifested in territorial disputes between MDs and KMDs, internally among KMDs, and publicly in debates between EAM-based and biomedicine-based discourse. Three Levels of Analysis Unsurprisingly, most social science scholars focused on this level of analysis when exploring issues related to Korean medicine. The country's division of medical labor allows KMDs to engage in Korean medicine practices only, which are symbolized in public imaginations by EAM therapies, such as acupuncture (ch'im), moxibustion (gu), and herbal remedies (hanyak), notwithstanding the complicated semantic politics these terms invoke. Investigations largely focused on the issue of \"medical modernity,\" and many of them attempted to reveal the facets of KMDs' identity that are precarious, unstable, and undetermined in the context of social, politico-economic, and epistemic forces surrounding their contemporary presence in biomedicine-based healthcare, and in the WM-KM two-tiered Korean healthcare system in particular. In doing so, researchers extended their explorations into the ways in which each element in this socio-political matrix surrounding this unique modern medical profession interacts with each other in a complex interplay of negotiations and adaptations. Let us focus on works based upon long-term fieldwork and ethnography. Jongyoung Kim explored, mainly through a sociological lens, how KMDs have strived to mobilize the knowledge and resources to overcome their \"precarious\" place in the biomedicine-based world and how they are adversely affected in the process; that is, in pursuit for the scientific legitimation of their claims ( [Kim, 2007](#b19)), in mobilizing a network of resources for industrial success ( [Kim, 2009](#b20)), in being alienated in the [End Page production of the patented herb-based pharmaceuticals ( [Kim, 2014a](#b21)), and in marshalling scientific expertise vindicate traditional medical theories ( [Kim, 2014b](#b22)). Similarly, Eunjeong Ma tackled the problem of modernity, albeit with the qualification that KMDs holds a unique epistemic position in Korean healthcare, by exploring claim-making\u2014mostly between MDs and KMDs\u2014in the context of postcolonial re-positioning of healthcare discourse, through the analysis of the KMD-pharmacists conflict ( [Ma, 2010](#b33)), debates concerning KMDs' use of biomedical technologies ( [Ma and Lynch, 2014](#b35)), and the process of herb-based pharmaceuticals development ( [Ma, the cabinet, computed tomography, and patent pharmaceuticals, reflects the discursive planes dominating professional discourse in Korea, or expert claim-making in general, she revealed how claims forwarded in lieu of professional interests based on differing epistemologies shift in the wider postcolonial conditions in which their claims are located. Unlike previous two authors, Taewoo Kim approaches the subject through direct engagement with clinical practice. By investigating how KMDs' practice is conducted and evolves, while keeping allegiance to EAM concepts, in the realm of text-inspired practice ( [Kim, 2014](#b21)), in ( he explored how, despite epistemic power differentials, KMDs maintain diversity in EAM practice and in doing so, create their own medical modernity. Recently, [In Hyo Park (2018)](#b48), through his account of the \"KMD-MD collaborative treatment,\" added an exploration of how KMDs' exposure to the world of biomedicine has affected their identity and how in the process, their uncertain place came to be repeatedly confirmed. These works tend to be based on the assumptions that KMDs' core identity is derived from the EAM tradition and that science and biomedicine play tangential, or instrumental, roles in its construction. The aim of this paper is to challenge these assumptions, by arguing that biomedicine and its corollaries have been central in the formation of KMDs' professional consciousness, and based upon this renewed perspective, to offer a different way of looking at it. In exploring KMDs' identity, I suggest that in addition to this much explored (or the \"visible\") level where what I call \"epistemic-professional concerns\" were prioritized, there are two other levels: structural and socioeconomic. The structural (or the \"invisible\") level involves elements that are not immediately recognizable and elicited by both outsiders and insiders. The socioeconomic level refers to the status and authority of [End Page 169] medical profession flowing from the market monopoly granted by the state. This paper aims to discuss all three levels\u2014how the mismatch among the levels brings many challenges\u2014although the main focus is on the structural level. Clinically, the structural level involves areas other than the therapies offered, including diagnosis, record keeping, and prognosticating, that is, areas where KMDs' duties as mainstream physicians are performed. Institutionally, they include professional training regime, legal duties, and their relation to state authorities. At this level, biomedicalization and its effects feature heavily. In a private sector-led system where the percentage of state-owned hospital beds fell below 10% of the country's total beds ( [Lee, 2016](#b30)) and hence, the interdependence between the state and medical professions is crucial, biomedicalization works in both directions; KMDs pursue it to expand their territory while state authorities instigate it to rationalize their governance. KMDs' \"medical status\" becomes essential in this relationship and the resemblance between MDs and KMDs, rather than opposition, emerges as they share important common interests, sometimes acting together against the state they believe exploit their labor. The KMD's professional identity observed here is stable, because, being a modern medical profession, they share the prerogatives issued from the state with other medical practitioners. Whether strategically or unconsciously, KMDs consider their activity at this level as bureaucratic routine, not highlighting them unless they feel the need. The mismatch between the \"epistemic-professional\" level and this level\u2014one where unstable aspects of their identity are pronounced and the other their mainstream position\u2014becomes the biggest source of challenges concerning their identity. For the investigation of KMDs' medical identity, I apply the insights of several existing research. One particular study crucial in this paper is [Simon Sinclair's (1997)](#b45) work Making Doctors: An Institutional Apprenticeship, an ethnography of students' life at a London medical school. This book is given extensive treatment, as it successfully portrays the inner worlds of medics. What Sinclair described might not be confined to the medical profession, but in our discussion\u2014where KMDs' identity is explored\u2014I trust his scheme is a valid analytical platform. After presenting KMDs' clinical and sociological profiles, including their relationship with the state, this paper will delve into analysis utilizing the data gathered among KMDs, to reveal that despite similarities to biomedical practitioners, their professional consciousness differs in key aspects. [End Page 170] Challenges Concerning KMDs' Professional Identity Challenges emerge due to the aforementioned mismatch, and they are the outcome of a historical contingency that has made KMDs' position unique in modern healthcare among practitioners of the medicines of nonbiomedical origin. American osteopathic physicians might be the only equivalent. If you look at EAM practitioners, traditional medicine physicians in China were given licenses only in 2000, following years of socialist stateguided professional developments. Therefore, it is hard to say that Chinese doctors have similar collective experiences of pursuing their developments\u2014a key ingredient in medical professionalization ( [Freidson, 1988:82-84](#b9))\u2014and market monopoly, to KMDs who have done so for seven decades since their legal status as \"medical doctor\" was acknowledged in 1951. In comparison, Doctors of Chinese Medicine (CM) in Taiwan have achieved a small-scale professionalization. However, as their licensing system had followed a two-track route up until 2010, namely that of college education and self-studies, it would be difficult to claim that CM doctors have attained the degree of the public and state's trust on their expertise comparable to Taiwanese MDs. And kampo MDs in Japan, whose EAM training is limited at a postgraduate level ( [Park et al., 2016:380](#b41)), practicing EAM mainly as adjuncts, would better be classified as biomedical practitioners rather than alongside practitioners such as KMDs. What comes close is American Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). Although they are \"marginally in\" ( [Maretzki, 1985:28](#b36)), or are not commanding the same public recognition as MDs, they have obtained the \"medical status.\" The manipulative medicine of the Midwest origin founded by Andrew Taylor Still (1828-1917) in the late-nineteenth century now boasts 102,137 licensed practitioners as of 2016 and 33 schools, compared to 1.1 million MDs and 179 MD schools. In 1962, a limited license unification between MDs and DOs has occurred in California ( [Baer, 1987:179](#b1); [Gevitz, 2004:133-134](#b10)). A separate licensing system is maintained, but postgraduate clinical training has recently been integrated, permitting MDs and DOs to choose clinical specialist training in any hospital whether it is affiliated with an MD or DO school ( [Miller et al., 2016](#b37)). In the case of KMDs, who totaled 21,630 in 2019 with MDs numbering 105,628 and dentists 26,486, biomedicalization has taken place extensively. Despite differences in opinion regarding the quality of biomedical contents taught, expert researchers and newspaper reports agree that between 70 and 80 percent of the KM school curriculum is [End Page 171] biomedical in [Kim, 2015](#b18); [Song, 2015](#b46)). Officially, many subjects in the curriculum are EAM in name but they contain a substantial amount of biomedical contents. While I was a student in late 1980s and early 1990s, for example, a textbook we used in the class contained so much contents from a well-known WM internal medicine textbook that WM students used to buy it to supplement their studies. KMDs and MDs can employ one another in hospitals and share the International Classification of Disease (ICD)-based disease classification system developed by the World Health Organization. Many KMDs work as nighttime on-call doctors in long-term care or rehabilitation hospitals, where either a mixture of KM and biomedical or exclusively biomedical treatments are offered. Performing on-call duties does not mean KMDs engage in WM practices, such as prescribing antibiotics and performing surgeries. However, under the law where KMDs are licensed to perform, rather tautologically, Korean medicine practices, without specifying what those practices are, many gray areas exist. They also serve as physicians in the military and public health offices, and I have even seen a newspaper report about a KMD who has secured the second prize in an emergency resuscitation competition held among military physicians ( [Kim, 2016a](#b17)). Hospital-based KMDs utilize advanced biomedical diagnostic technologies such as MRI and CTs, generally through MDs hired, and resort frequently to what is called the \"Western medicine diagnosis and Korean medicine treatment\" paradigm, applying KM therapies within the biomedicine-based overall treatment plan. It is hard to periodize the process of biomedicalization, and [Park (2018:183-185)](#b40) indicates the introduction of KM hospitals in the 1970s and the state's active encouragement of KM-WM collaborative treatments in 2000s as factors contributing to its acceleration. However, based on the facts such as that KMDs have already campaigned successfully to gain the right to use stethoscopes in the 1960s and that some KMDs were granted limited-area MD licenses following six months of extra education, as well as that the length of education envisaged by the governing military junta in 1961 for the existing KMDs to be transformed into MDs was also six months, [3](#f3) shows that the process began much earlier. It is a fair assumption therefore that KMDs are physicians whose professional outlook is substantially influenced by biomedicine. This is why the government's plan to unify KMD and MD licenses by 2030 is not considered an outrageous idea by all the stakeholders. The family resemblance between these two professions is uncanny and they share biomedicine as the common denominator. [End Page 172] For those dealing with KMDs as a profession, there are two types of challenges. Firstly, there are definitional ones since KMDs defy simple categorization. KMDs practice traditional medicine, yet due to their mainstream role, the title of \"traditional medicine practitioners\"\u2014a term generally reserved for those staying outside mainstream medicine without the state support and social prerogatives enjoyed by KMDs\u2014seems unsuitable. They are not biomedical physicians either, because besides the fact that KMDs are not allowed to perform biomedical therapies, their professional consciousness is not entirely biomedical. When a KMD's identity is placed in international contexts, these challenges become starker. In OECD statistics, Korean doctor numbers are presented in two versions\u2014one counting KMDs and the other not\u2014as the state bureaucrats themselves are unsure as to how to categorize them. This has some political implications because, depending on KMDs' inclusion, the country's physician number rises and falls. The MD association, therefore, in order to block the state's efforts to produce more doctors, sometimes resorts to the physician number statistics including KMDs. Secondly, practical challenges occur and controversies concerning the provision of full rights to modern diagnostic technology is one. Although hospital-based KMDs have virtually no barriers to diagnostic apparatus, the rights are officially denied to them under the Medical Law specifying the division of medical labor. This issue of indeterminacy sometimes becomes the subject of professional and legal contestations, as explored by [Ma and Lynch (2014)](#b35) concerning a KMD who installed the CT facility in his clinic. Many conflicts previously investigated, such as pharmacy-KMD conflict ( [Cho, 2000](#b7); [Ma, 2014a](#b21); [Ma, 2015](#b34)), are associated Medical Identity: Sinclair's \"Medical Dispositions\" Considering KMDs' mainstream role and their resemblance with MDs, KMDs' identity would be best investigated based upon works exploring the modern medical profession. I will review some of the works below. Among many disciplines, which sought to identify their characteristics, sociology\u2014American sociology in particular\u2014came early, partly due to the \"American fascination with the medical profession\" delineated the various attitudes [End Page 173] inculcated into the students while they work through the training phase. [Charles Bosk (1979)](#b4) studied trainee surgeons and investigated how they and their superiors construct professional consciousness through incidents of mistakes. And [Eliot Freidson (1988)](#b9) investigated the doctors as the profession par excellence having the power to set the terms of their work based on expert knowledge. Some political scientists also delved into this subject. [Harry Eckstein (1960)](#b8) explored the British Medical Association in the formative years of the National Health Service, revealing that the medical profession has a deep connection with the state and can influence national policies to achieve favorable terms. This aspect of the state's symbiotic relationship with doctors, in which the former safeguards the latter's market monopoly in return for their services to the public, was aptly termed by British political scientist [Rudolf Klein (1990:702)](#b29) as the \"politics of double bed.\" Social historian [Paul Starr's (1982)](#b50) work on the American medical profession and the formation of their professional identity accompanying their rise in capitalist social milieu is also well known. [Norman Gevitz (2004)](#b10) produced an equally extensive exploration of how the identity of osteopathic physicians has been formed in the context of initial animosity, but eventual collaboration, from the American Medical Association. Anthropological enquiry came late, with [Hahn and Gaines (1985)](#b12) presenting the clinical and sociological characteristics of biomedical practitioners in various specialties. Having gone through both processes\u2014becoming a doctor and a social anthropologist\u2014I, however, felt that these studies overlooked crucial elements that define the profession from within. Coming across [Simon Sinclair (1997)](#b45), who as a medic himself undertook fieldwork at a London medical school as part of anthropological study, I felt confident that his work provided just that. By digging deeply into the collective psyche of the medical profession, Sinclair captured what I assume to be the key characteristic of the medical profession, namely their \"cognitive boundedness\"\u2014a tendency for them to limit their perspectives within certain frames of reference. Sinclair illustrates this cognitive tendency like the following: their (students) unceasing need to work for unceasing examinations set by different professional segments will ultimately result in professional cognitive membership of the institution of which they are an inmate (that is, the profession of medicine), a passage and a membership that may exclude the lay world just as surely as asylum walls.( [Sinclair, 1997:15]) [End Page 174] As far as my own experience and research are concerned, this \"boundedness\" is shared by KMDs, precisely because their professionalization is modeled on biomedicine. [Sinclair (1997)](#b45) breaks down the characteristics of the consciousness of medical profession with the concept of \"Medical Dispositions.\" This concept operates on three theoretically distinctive but inter-related planes: Pierre Bourdieu's [Bourdieu, 1977:72](#b5)); theories of psychological schema which one is assumed to utilize to understand the world outside ( [Young, 1990](#b53)); and [Erving Goffman's (1959)](#b11) idea of performative interpretation of one's identity construction. Medical dispositions are something nurtured, learned and transmitted, socially and historically, and contributes to the formation of medical habitus ( [Sinclair, 1997:22-25](#b45)). Over the course of their training, medics learn these dispositions and distinguish themselves from the lay world by forming specific cognitive attitudes. Seven dispositions contribute to the formation of medical habitus: the dispositions of Knowledge, Cooperation, Competition, Responsibility, Experience, Economy, and Idealism. To briefly explain each, the disposition of Knowledge is nurtured so that the students can look at the world in specific ways; scientifically during preclinical years and pathologically in clinical years. In so doing, vision-based knowledge, particularly that of anatomy, is prioritized over knowledge based on other senses. A collective belief in \"scientific certainty\" is instilled through a Socratic style of question and answer ( [Sinclair, 1997:146-148, 188-189](#b45)). Negative attitudes towards subjects such as sociology and psychology develop as a result ( [Sinclair, 1997:126, 166](#b45)). The nurturance of a Cooperation disposition allows the trainees to aggregate with the profession, but simultaneously segregate them from the lay population. Cooperation is achieved through the shared use of languages, whose usage and meaning are specific to the practice of medicine; such as when they learn to use the word \"relative\" only, not \"relation,\" when referring to patients' kin ( [Sinclair, 1997:141](#b45)). \"corporate corporality\" ( [Sinclair, 1997:297](#b45)) is emphasized well enough to encourage cooperation, the need for a Competition disposition develops as training progresses and competition between different segments of the profession and between individuals increases accordingly. When they reach the level of training where their relationship with patients becomes salient, the disposition of Responsibility begins to gain an emphasis; it is manifested in the form of \"ownership\"\u2014a term that not [End Page 175] only exemplifies your right to the patient's whole person, but also your own legal responsibility ( [Sinclair, 1997:251-295](#b45)). As clinical training progresses, the Experience disposition\u2014in contrast to \"book learning\"\u2014also starts to feature in the students' education. The disposition of Economy, or the capacity to cut short tasks for efficiency, figures across pre-clinical and clinical years, and comes to have renewed importance as the trainees deal with complex practical tasks in the ward ( [Sinclair, 1997:159-164, 280-286](#b45)). The Idealism disposition, of which two types exist\u2014namely personal and professional\u2014is emphasized sporadically and the students learn that the personal Idealism of doing good for the patients will give way to the professional Idealism of performing well as members of the profession ( [Sinclair, 1997:297](#b45)). Sinclair argues that these medical habitus\" ( [Sinclair, 1997:25](#b45)) characterized by cognitive boundedness. As mentioned, this boundedness might not be unique to the medical profession, but in accounts like Sinclair's and the one in this paper where substantial amount of the author's biography is inculcated, it can be plausibly employed. Some might argue that the concept of habitus might be too rigid a concept to allow for historical changes observed in medicine by its exclusive focus on inheritance and transmission. But, in light of the market monopoly doctors have since the introduction of medical licenses in mid-nineteenth century England, as well as the power they wield to the extent that [Ivan Illich (1976)](#b15) referred to medical doctors replacing the church clergy, the concept still seems a valid tool to characterize the professional consciousness of modern medical profession. Characteristics of KMDs' Professional Identity In exploring KMDs' professional identity based on the insights presented thus far, KMDs' sociological and clinical profiles would be best captured when they are defined as \"mainstream physicians practicing Korean-style EAM whose professional outlook is strongly influenced by biomedicine.\" KMDs as Mainstream Physicians Influenced by Biomedicine Firstly, KMDs are mainstream practitioners. As [Freidson (1988:82-84, 185-187)](#b9) emphasized, the penultimate criterion of being a profession is its capacity to control the terms of its work, or occupational autonomy, in [End Page 176] areas such as licensing, training, and the assessment of their work, with endorsements from the state. KMDs do have this autonomy, at least to the degree that Korean MDs have. The public's recognition of them as professionals, translated into what is called \"prestige\" ( [Starr, 1977:592](#b49); [Freidson, 1988:178](#b9)), is granted to KMDs. Such prestige is shown in their popularity as a career choice for high school students and their parents, who for over a decade since the mid-1990s have put KM schools' competitiveness higher up in the entry-difficulty ladder than MD schools, which had historically enjoyed the highest competitiveness in the nation. [4](#f4) The statement offered by a junior doctor at the beginning of this paper testifies to the trend. In a culture where people spend a huge amount of resources on children's education ( [Sorensen, 1988:199](#b47)) and one's educational attainment is an important source of social capital ( [Kim, 1992:113](#b16)), and is even considered a \"key criterion of human worth\" ( [Brandt, 1971:95](#b6)), this speaks volumes about their social status. Their high socioeconomic position leads to the recruitment of society's elite into the profession, reinforcing their status. KMDs' income continues to secure the uppermost range in the income spectrum ( [Na, 2012:50](#b38)). Reflecting this, they sometimes flex their political muscles by squarely facing the MD association or the state. For example, in their struggles with pharmacists in the early 1990s, KMDs almost paralyzed the state authorities, including the Ministry of Health, through their collective action ( [Cho, 2000:124-125](#b7); [Na, 2012:48-49](#b38)). In a KMD convention attended during fieldwork, I also observed that many political luminaries voiced their support of the profession. Due to this strength KMDs hold, state authorities sometimes use the \"divide and rule\" or \"causing troubles within\" strategy in which they pit one medical profession against another or to cause internal divisions by proposing contentious policies. In relation to the turmoil that occurred within the KM community in 2012, vice health minister indeed mentioned to his associates that he was using the latter tactic on the KMD association ( [Lee, 2012](#b31)). KMDs are delegated policymaking responsibilities by the state. During the policy work, I was surprised firstly by the authoritative demeanor the director-level executives in the KM association hold in the Ministry of Health and, secondly, by the fact that KMD and MD association insurance directors were in constant contacts, frequently to discuss matters of mutual opposition sometimes but often to join forces to extract much from the state. [Klein's (1990)](#b29) conceptualization of the symbiosis between the state and the medical profession as parties sharing a \"double bed\" was accurate, as I observed how the KM executives push, coax, and even sabotage the [End Page 177] state bureaucrats who in turn throw carrots in good times but give cold shoulders in others, albeit within a certain limit. Secondly, KMDs are practicing Korean-style EAM and their professional outlook is strongly influenced by biomedicine. As mentioned, the legal purview of a KMD's practice is tautological, with the implication that KM is whatever KMDs are practicing. Overall, however, their practice has settled in the direction of dealing with ailments of musculoskeletal systems, gynecological conditions, aesthetics concerns, pediatric diseases, and other areas termed \"complementary and alternative or integrative medicine\" in the literature, such as cancer and other immunerelated diseases. But the perimeter of their practice, with easy access to biomedical resources, shifts according to market needs, a factor also dictating MDs' business pattern. Although advertisements cannot capture the nature of their practice fully, the range of publicized services gives us an indication of how KMDs behave in medical marketplace. In three high street buildings in a city near Seoul I regularly see, seven KM clinics placed adverts. One advertised \"temporomandibular joints problem, facial imbalance, traffic accident, diet, gynecological concerns, acme, skin tension enhancement and aesthetic treatment,\" while another whose name bears \"going out well\"\u2014presumably emphasizing detoxification\u2014advertised \"chronic pain, fatigue, post-menopausal syndrome, diet, traffic accident and menstrual period pain.\" One clinic whose name includes \"stomach strong\" advertised \"dam-stagnant [] disorder, gastrointestinal ailments, mouth disease and pain clinic.\" Another one publicized pediatrics conditions and one next to it advertised \"ch'una treatments [] and traffic accident.\" The remaining two focused on diet and children's ailments respectively, the latter advertising \"cold, sinusitis, middle-ear infection, atopic dermatitis, immune booster and communal living syndrome\" as its focus. KMDs' primary care role and their biomedical category-based practice are apparent in these adverts. The main therapeutic modalities are EAM types, such as acupuncture, moxibustion, and herbal medicine. As mentioned, Korean EAM is characterized by its reliance on Dongibogam, or \"the compendium of the compendiums\" ( [Shin, 2015:285](#b44)) which systematized the then-popular theories and Yuan Dynasties 2004:265](#b43); [Shin, 2015:285-289](#b44)). Although the more empiricist Shanghan (Cold Damage) schools were introduced during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945), and the Wenbing (Warm Disorder) school arrived from China in late 1980s, Dongibogam-based practice is still the norm in Korean practice. The only exception is the Sasang Constitutional Medicine, under which one is given a [End Page 178] herbal regimen specific to one's constitution, all determined by inherent disequilibrium in functions of four internal organs of our body, namely the lung, spleen, liver, and kidneys ( [Kim and Pham, 2009:12-13](#b20); [Yi, 2018](#b52)). As muscular-skeletal symptoms are the most frequent complaint encountered in KM clinics ( [Wang et al., 2013](#b51)), new therapies aimed at these conditions developed accordingly. They include a syringe-based injection of distilled EAM pharmaceuticals called pharmaco-acupuncture (yakch'im), which is used to control pain and inflammation, and ch'una therapy, which originated from the namesake traditional EAM therapy but incorporated chiropractic and osteopathic techniques. Some use minor surgical techniques called doch'im in which mess-like acupuncture needles are inserted into the vertebral or other bone joints to remove the hardened, calcified tissues. In another acupuncture-based therapy called maesn, or thread embedding acupuncture ( [Yun and Choi, 2015:171](#b54)), surgical threads are inserted under the skin to smooth the wrinkles. All these require extensive biomedical knowledge and resources to perform, including realtime CT scanning in the case of doch'im. [5](#f5) In diagnosis, traditional categories of Yin and Yang () and the Eight Rubrics () are widely used as a basis for herbal prescriptions, but many hospital-based KMDs rely on images and lab findings to assess the patients' condition. Many local clinicians also attempt to get their hands on these tests, either by referral or by taking the tests themselves using lowspec devices. During consultation, KMDs do resort to traditional medical terms, albeit with the knowledge that in events of legal suits, the patient's biomedical conditions and the relevance of the doctor's treatments to them\u2014not the traditional medical concepts\u2014have critical importance. Finally, KMDs' practice is situated within the biomedical frame of governance including their use of the ICD disease classification system. The main objective of the Korean Medicine and Pharmacy Promotion Law enacted in 2002 was also to develop novel drugs based upon the empirical knowledge stored in traditional medicine. A considerable portion of research activities at the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine\u2014the national institute of Korean medicine\u2014therefore concentrates on how to harness pharmaceutical potentials of the field through biomedical tools. My policy experience also confirmed the state's biomedicine-based governance regime. Almost all the officials I met expressed their wishes for our KM policy products to follow the biomedical model. In one project commissioned by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which aimed at developing a KM clinic-based model of managing hypertension and diabetes, the officials requested explicitly that we provide biomedical [End Page 179] evidence and emphasized that our outputs should be comparable to the igwa, or biomedical, model. In another project commissioned by the Health Insurance Review Agency to develop a new KM hospital inpatient classification system, the government officials emphasized the same point highlighting the need for administrative efficiency. KMDs' Medical Dispositions Most dispositions highlighted in Sinclair's study are acquired in KM schools. Knowledge disposition, particularly that of anatomy, takes the central focus during the pre-clinical years. Highlighting its importance, an anatomy professor at KM school at Pusan National University who teaches first year students mentioned that the school was using five cadavers for the class of fifty, a substantial number considering the lack of the specimen ( [Kim, 2011](#b25)). Students learn to Cooperate but, as their training deepens, they realize the importance of Competition. During the clinical years, students learn to pathologize their own conditions using languages alien to everyday life. Consequently, just as with Sinclair's students, I remember having a fair share of \"medical student diseases\" ( [Sinclair, 1997:156](#b45)) in our clinical rotation group, which affected students in that they believed they had the conditions being taught. Experience and Responsibility were emphasized as our encounters with patients increased in clinical years. The disposition of Economy was prized throughout the student years, and we experienced that our personal Idealism gave way to professional Idealism. Differences exist. Firstly, the competition between different specialties was not emphasized as drastically as in Sinclair's subject population, probably reflecting the less-rigid demarcation in the KM field between the types of patients treated across different specialties than in biomedicine. KMDs are also tolerant of clinical languages with \"non-material\" referents, probably because they practice EAM and those languages form an integral part of its clinical regimen. This does not mean that KMDs do not prefer languages with material referents; they certainly do, as we shall see. In terms of professional Idealism, that of KMDs seems more in tune with their professional politics than among Sinclair's students. This might reflect, however, the different ways in which medical practice is situated, namely in state-provided health services for Sinclair's cohorts and the marketoriented system for their Korean counterparts. The biggest difference lies in their attitude towards scientific certainty. In pre-clinical years, KM students learn the importance of science but they [End Page 180] are not encouraged to \"scientize\" the world ( [Sinclair, 1997:151-155](#b45)) as observed at the London school. Instead, when I was a student, they were encouraged to nurture gwan (), translated as \"perspective,\" which denotes a psychological schema of Buddhist sort through which one is believed to reach a plateau of understanding. Seniors must have encouraged this to reduce the students' confusion when they encountered alien EAM concepts. Therefore, it is not surprising that a collective belief in scientific certainty is not present among KMDs who, despite their respect for science, are not fully subsumed by its pull. Cases of Clinical Discussion Let us now explore how these dispositions are manifested in real-life settings. Choosing the samples has been difficult, firstly because it is impossible to go into a KM clinician's head during her consultation. Secondly, even if that is possible, her approach might not be representative. Data can also be obtained by observing how KMDs behave in clinical settings but this approach will only reveal the \"visible\"\u2014or predominantly EAM-parts. Also, as it takes place in what [Sinclair (1997:16)](#b45) calls an \"official frontstage\" setting in the presence of an outsider, their professional Idealism, mentioned as being linked with professional politics, might color the way they present themselves. Given these difficulties, I present below a set of ethnographic vignettes, constructed from data gathered from the aforementioned KMD online community, where the anonymity of its members is meticulously protected, that is, an \"official backstage\" in [Sinclair's (1997:16)](#b45) terminology. My defense against selection bias would be that any discussion among KMDs will unfold similarly should it be held long enough. The two cases, one dealing with stroke and the other indigestion, will help us understand what a KMD's mind goes through, when dealing with conditions differing in nature. I translated the conversation verbatim to illustrate how the interlocutors use phrases and words concerning patient management and how the specific use reveals their medical dispositions. Vignette 1: Post-Stroke Management A 64-year old female patient, who had visited Dr K's clinic for sprained ankle, visited Dr K again, suspecting that she had an impending stroke. Judging from her symptoms, the doctor thought that it might indeed be the case and referred [End Page 181] her to a university hospital. Now the patient returned on a wheelchair, paralyzed on one side of her body after a stroke that occurred a few days after the referral. Dr K inquired, \"I checked the Babinski's sign, blood pressure and pupil reflex. The reflex was slow so I sent her to a big hospital for a check-up. But after four months, she came on a wheelchair with left hemiplegia. She was told she had light infarction in her brain but after three days of the injection of Ringer's solution, she couldn't raise her hand and found herself paralyzed. They must have prescribed thrombolytic agents? ... It's been three months [since she came to me again] but she still can't use her arms. I'd like to see some pictures (MRI, or CT) but ... communication is hard. Is it the natural course ... or is it drug adverse reaction (haemorrhage or drug resistance)? ... She was transferred to the [mid-size] hospital from the university hospital I had referred her to, with an assurance [from the university hospital] that the condition would get better in six months. I don't know if I don't have enough knowledge or those who don't know are actually yangbaek [or western butchers] themselves.\" Dr X replied, \"You've made a right decision. It might have been a disaster [in liability aspect] had it been late. For those early-phase cases in which the affected region is identified with imaging, medical staff explains every possible symptom ... Hemiplegia is most common and the patient's condition seems to have deteriorated slowly over three days. For CVA [or cerebrovascular accident] patients, during initial three months, the recovery is the fastest, and the patients are checked on six and nine months and when the period goes beyond three months, the prognosis is poor. Whether thrombolytic agents were administered is unclear (from your descriptions, and I don't know what kind of medication was administered). Ringer's solution is not evidence-based but that's the routine treatment. The possibility of adverse reactions? I don't know. Even in Western medicine hospitals [yangbangbyngwn] there is nothing to do except for the rehabilitation ... they check conditions such as HTN [or hypertension] and DM [or diabetes mellitus] ... If you want to treat CVA patients in the local, you should focus on teaching to prevent subsequent attacks (it would be almost impossible for you to do it alone without employing someone responsible for the patient's rehabilitation). The sensible option is to treat CVA-induced complaints (such as pain in the affected and unaffected limb, and neuralgia, or another internal medical condition like thalamic pain) ... Of course, it all depends on which area of the brain was affected.\" Then Dr Y, an observer, joined in, \"On what basis the diagnosis of infarction was made? CT, MRI? The disease must have been progressing ... Other possibility might include Ringer's solution as you suggested. Injecting the fluid into bloodstream is like injecting [it] right into the heart ... If heart's yanggi []is weak, I believe it has bad consequence. It's like coldness getting into the heart directly. I know someone with heart conditions who died immediately after being injected with Ringer's solution. One of my patients with extreme weak yanggi suffered shivering and palpitations after the injection. I am not sure of the [End Page 182] correlation, but I teach patients that as coldness damages the heart, fluids should be discontinued. If there is adverse effect on heart, it would be also possible that blood clots can form and stroke develops.\" Among many dispositions manifested, the Cooperation disposition is most recognizable; and it is facilitated by the use of jargons as \"local,\" \"teaching,\" \"routine treatment,\" \"CVA,\" and \"thalamic pain.\" Shared knowledge of these terms and their specific use allows them to aggregate to their profession while segregating from the public. In Dr K's question mentioning the biomedical test of checking the Babinski sign and pupil reflex, we can discern the KMD's Knowledge disposition. In the doctor's wish to see \"pictures,\" as mentioned in [Hahn (1985:70)](#b12) regarding an internist's reliance on them, the prioritization of vision-based knowledge is also seen. Dr K manifests his personal Idealism by an intention to do good for the patient, while simultaneously expressing his professional Idealism upon criticizing MDs for their routine use of thrombolytic agents, demonstrating that KMDs' professional Idealism is linked with professional politics. In Dr X's response, the Responsibility disposition is manifested in the form of legal liability and the \"ownership of patient.\" Although the information is limited, it is likely that the patient's condition followed its natural course. However, the possibility of a drug-induced hemorrhagic stroke cannot be ruled out, because aspirin\u2014the mostly prescribed thrombolytic agent\u2014is believed to increase the risk of cerebral bleeding ( [Berardis et al., 2012](#b3)). Nevertheless, after discussing the possible causes, Dr X advises Dr K on the local-based care of the patient, highlighting KMDs' primary care role. In Dr X's reply, we can also observe how biomedicalized post-stroke management take center stage. If it were not for Dr Y's intervention, the \"empirical\" ways in which the conversation developed might pass as an exchange between MDs. Dr Y, however, by expressing skepticism about providing fluid therapies irrespective of the patient's innate conditions, shed a discriminating light. In the hypothesis proposed based on Yin-Yang differentials, we see how biomedical and EAM elements are uniquely amalgamated. Notable also is that the interlocutors show a tendency to do something for the patient rather than doing nothing, or what [Freidson (1988:169)](#b9) calls the \"actionorientation\"\u2014an element constituting clinical mentality of doctors as a consulting profession. [End Page 183] Vignette 2: Determining Formulas for Indigestion The second case is about sikch'e (), or food-stagnation disorder. Dr W is faced with the problem of choosing between two formulas. Dr W enquired, \"[The patient's] symptoms include discomfort below the heart [simhabi ], vomiting and diarrhoea. panhasasimt'ang is used for Yang Overflow and kwakhyangjngg'isan is for m Overflow. What kind of differential criteria do you apply?\" Dr B replied, \"If the condition has accompanying surface symptoms, kwakhyangjngg'isan is better. If not, it needs to be panhasasimt'ang.\" Dr W followed up, \"By 'surface symptom' do you mean shivering and fever?\" At this point, an observer Dr S retorted, \"Well, headache, body ache, aversion to cold and fever. Aren't these basics?\", indicating disappointment at the lack of basic EAM knowledge. Kind Dr B replied, \"kwakhyangjngg'isan is for the pressed pain in the region of chungwan and panhasasimt'ang is for the pressed pain, or the sense of discomfort, in the region of below the heart. Strictly speaking, the target place of the formulas is different so the therapeutic aim is different.\" But Dr W was unsure, \"When you mentioned 'below the heart', did you mean the sternum or the region in the upper sangwan just below the sternal angle or did you mean chungwan? I think that for acute indigestion, the pressed pain for sangwan and chungwan is the necessary condition. [Am I right to assume that] when patients have discomfort below the heart, they could or could not have pain at sangwan or chungwan?\" Dr B then replied in more detail, \"Below the heart is near ggwl and gumi points and [pain in the region] reflects heat in the heart. Pressed pain at chungwan reflects stagnation in the motility of gastro-intestinal tract. If indigestion comes from stress, there is no accompanying pressed pain in the chungwan region and that's when panhasasimt'ang works, but in the case of the presence of pressed pain at chungwan, it's better to start with p'yngwisan [or the base formula for kwakhyangjngg'isan].\" Asking for further clarifications on the exact location of 'below the heart' in relation to gumi and ggwl acu-points, Dr W continued asking, \"Is 'below heart' the areas of infra-sternal angle or xiphoid process? And is there a case where the region of xiphoid process shows pressed pain while the symptom does not occur in chungwan and sangwan points, considering their spatial proximity?\" Then Dr B, replied with more explanation, \"Chungwan is where the stomach and duodenum meet, and there is no organ below the xiphoid process, and this means pain in this region should be differentiated from pain in chungwan and sangwan\" (see [Fig. 1]). In this vignette characterized by inquisitive exchanges, dispositions of Cooperation and Knowledge are pronounced. The latter is underpinned again by an emphasis on anatomy, with scientific and logical approaches being the mainstay, running counter to the generally received notion that [End Page 184] Click for larger view [View full resolution](/article/800133/figure/fig01) EAM practitioners utilize a holistic approach. In Dr S's rebuke towards Dr W, we can ascertain their loyalty to EAM. However, in their deliberations leading to the distinction between stress-induced discomfort and gastrointestinal motility-induced one, we observe the ways the biomedical\u2014albeit functional\u2014referents take center stage. In their usage of phrases such as \"the first and second choice formulas,\" \"target place\" and \"necessary symptoms,\" we could also witness the effects of biomedicine on their clinical consciousness. It is also noteworthy that despite their reliance on biomedical referents, their conversation did not lead to the discussion of proton-pump inhibitors, or a gastroscopic examination, the points to be certainly raised [End Page 185] by MDs. In the context of kampo-style diagnostic approaches, those points might have been unnecessary, not to mention that KMDs are currently offlimits to those modalities. Also, when the majority approved the veracity of the discussion, members with a radically different opinion might have been disinclined to intervene. However, considering the strong outer pressure for the MD-KMD license integration set by the government within ten years' time, the long discussion focusing on EAM resources alone indicates that in pursuit of their professional Idealism, KMDs are still content to stay, holding onto their resources, within the professional boundaries currently drawn in the intersection of market conditions and state directives. Conclusion This paper explored the identity of Doctors of Korean Medicine, a medical profession in South Korea practicing traditional East Asian medicine. After offering a conceptual framework by which the KMDs' identity can be explored on multiple levels, this paper critically reviewed existing ethnographic works that the author assumed focused on one level, or the most visible one. They explored KMDs by addressing to the imbalance of power obtaining in their epistemic, thus social, underdog status in the world of biomedical hegemony. Critiquing the assumption shared among them that the core elements constructing KMDs' consciousness are EAM elements, science and biomedicine being tangential to its formation, this paper offered the view, by focusing on the structural\u2014or \"hidden\"\u2014aspects of their professional identity, that biomedicine has been key in shaping the profession, as it supplies the stable basis for their presence as modern medical profession. In light of this conceptual stance, the challenges posed by KMD's identity were argued to stem from the mismatch between these two different aspects of KMDs' identity, being precarious as EAM practitioners in biomedical world on one hand and stable as mainstream physicians on the other. Based on family resemblance existing between KMDs and MDs, the paper offers that KMDs' professional identity can be analyzed through works exploring modern medical profession. Among them, [Simon Sinclair's (1997)](#b45) work, where the concept of \"Medical Dispositions\" was utilized in exploring the \"medical habitus,\" was selected as the main analytical device with which to explore KMDs' professional consciousness. It is because, by comparing and contrasting it with Sinclair's subject [End Page 186] population of biomedical practitioners, important similarities and differences can be discerned. In seeking to illustrate KMDs' identity, the paper first provides an overview of their clinical and sociological profiles, namely as mainstream doctors practicing traditional EAM with a strong biomedical outlook. Clinically, they were seen to utilize EAM and other therapies expanded from it with the integration of biomedical and other resources. Institutionally, their practice was observed to be subjected to the state's biomedicine-based governance. Occupying the upper socioeconomic position as well as having policymaking power, KMDs were also seen to form a symbiotic relation, not just with the state but also with MDs, who often appear to be in opposition to KMDs. A rough overview of KMDs' dispositions was then offered, in comparison with MDs. Here, despite many similarities, important differences, such as the KMDs' lack of collective belief in scientific certainty and their tendency to link professional idealism with professional politics, were also shown to be present. To illustrate these points further, the paper introduced ethnographic cases constructed out of the real-life clinical discussions among KMDs. The analysis of the cases demonstrated that many attributes of modern medical profession are present in KMDs' professional identity, notably their primary care role, but it also illustrated that their professional consciousness exhibits an amalgamation of biomedical and EAM elements as well as their position in contemporary healthcare.

Notes [1.](#f1-text) Many ethnographic materials presented were drawn from the author's doctoral dissertation ( [Na, 2015](#b39)). [2.](#f2-text) I worked as a policy researcher at the Korean Medicine Policy Unit of Pusan National University for a year from March 2012. While participating in national-level KM policymaking as part of my job, I also participated in various activities that took place in the professional community, both in offline and online venues. I have also continued to practice as a clinician in Korea since 2016 upon completion of my academic sojourn in the UK. [3.](#f3-text) During my school years, some professors were dual license holders, holding a limited-area MD license. Many shared with us a story about how General Park Chung-hee (1917-1979)\u2014leader of the National Rebuilding Committee established after his military coup of 16th May 1961\u2014drafted a plan to abolish the KMD license in an effort to \"modernize\" the country's healthcare and to enroll KMDs at Seoul National University School of Medicine for six months of additional education, and how they resisted the move and turned it around to convert the existing KM school into a six-year institution, the same length as WM schools. [4.](#f4-text) Since the 2010s, the trend was reversed as WM schools' popularity has gone up again, while that of KM schools has relatively dropped. [5.](#f5-text) As [Jongyoung Kim (2019)](#b19) argued, these treatments can be considered \"hybrids,\" a theoretical concept introduced into the field by [Volker Scheid (2002)](#b42) in his research on traditional medicine in China. Certainly, there are elements of hybridity in these therapies when focusing on the conjuncture of modalities from two or three distinctive medial traditions. But, the notion of hybridity implying no specific imbalance of power between the parties being hybridized, I suspect that this notion fits more comfortably with the case of mainland China, where traditional medicine receives constitutionally-endorsed state support, than Korea where state authorities put considerable weights on biomedical evidence when approving new KM therapies or including them into the national health insurance.
