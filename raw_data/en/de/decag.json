If the 5 court orders the transfer of custody to a parent who does not 6 have physical care of the child, other relative, or other 7 suitable person, the court may direct the department or other 8 agency to provide services to the child's parent, guardian, 9 or custodian in order to enable them to resume custody of the 10 child. If the court orders the transfer of custody to the 11 department of human services or to another agency for placement 12 in group foster care, the department or agency shall make every 13 reasonable effort to place the child in the least restrictive, 14 most family-like, and most appropriate setting available, and 15 in close proximity to the parents' home, consistent with the 16 child's best interests and special needs, and shall consider 17 the placement's proximity to the school in which the child is 18 enrolled at the time of placement. 19 Sec. 624.

(1) That the parent, guardian, or person or agency 10 entitled to legal custody of a juvenile who has not been 11 adjudged delinquent but who has run away without the consent 12 of such parent, guardian, or person or agency may petition 13 the appropriate court in the demanding state for the issuance 14 of a requisition for the juvenile's return.

The petition shall be verified by affidavit, shall 23 be executed in duplicate, and shall be accompanied by two 24 certified copies of the document or documents on which the 25 petitioner's entitlement to the juvenile's custody is based, 26 such as birth certificates, letters of guardianship, or custody 27 decrees.

If the judge determines, either with or without a 2 hearing, that the juvenile should be returned, the judge shall 3 present to the appropriate court or to the executive authority 4 of the state where the juvenile is alleged to be located a 5 written requisition for the return of such juvenile. Such 6 requisition shall set forth the name and age of the juvenile, 7 the determination of the court that the juvenile has run away 8 without the consent of a parent, guardian, or person or agency 9 entitled to the juvenile's legal custody, and that it is in 10 the best interest and for the protection of such juvenile that 11 the juvenile be returned. In the event that a proceeding for 12 the adjudication of the juvenile as a delinquent, neglected or 13 dependent juvenile is pending in the court at the time when 14 such juvenile runs away, the court may issue a requisition for 15 the return of such juvenile upon its own motion, regardless 16 of the consent of the parent, guardian, or person or agency 17 entitled to legal custody, reciting therein the nature and 18 circumstances of the pending proceeding.

If the judge of such court shall 2 find that the requisition is in order, the judge shall deliver 3 such juvenile over to the officer whom the court demanding the 4 juvenile shall have appointed to receive the juvenile. The 5 judge, however, may fix a reasonable time to be allowed for the 6 purpose of testing the legality of the proceeding. 7 (2) Upon reasonable information that a person is a juvenile 8 who has run away from another state party to this compact 9 without the consent of a parent, guardian, or person or agency 10 entitled to the juvenile's legal custody, such juvenile may be 11 taken into custody without a requisition and brought forthwith 12 before a judge of the appropriate court who may appoint counsel 13 or guardian ad litem for such juvenile and who shall determine 14 after a hearing whether sufficient cause exists to hold the 15 person, subject to the order of the court, for the person's own 16 protection and welfare, for such a time not exceeding ninety 17 days as will enable the person's return to another state party 18 to this compact pursuant to a requisition for the person's 19 return from a court of that state.

The duly accredited officers 30 of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment 31 of their authority and the identity of the juvenile being 32 returned, shall be permitted to transport such juvenile through 33 any and all states party to this compact, without interference. 34 Upon the juvenile's return to the state from which the juvenile 35 LSB 2073HV (2) 90 ec/jh 405/ 1541 H.F. 662 ran away, the juvenile shall be subject to such further 1 proceedings as may be appropriate under the laws of that state. 2 b.

The bill is organized by 25 divisions. 26 DIVISION I \u2014\u2014 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. This 27 division provides the legislative changes for the realignment 28 of the department of human services (DHS) and department of 29 public health (DPH) into the department of health and human 30 services (HHS), as necessary, for consideration by the general 31 assembly during the 2023 legislative session to implement the 32 -1514- LSB 2073HV (2) 90 ec/jh 1514/ 1541 H.F. effective July 1, 2023, as required by 2022 Iowa 33 Acts, chapter 1131, section 51, subsection 6, paragraph \"a\". 34 In addition, the bill incorporates into HHS the department 35 on aging (DOA), the department of human rights (DHR), early 1 childhood Iowa, and the Iowa commission on volunteer services. 2 The bill eliminates references to the subunit structure 3 and the heads of such subunits of HHS and other agencies 4 incorporated into HHS below the department level, including 5 divisions, bureaus, and administrators. Some of these include 6 the center for rural health and primary care, the center 7 for congenital and inherited disorders, the oral health and 8 delivery systems bureau, the division of tobacco use prevention 9 and control, the division for records and statistics, the 10 bureau of professional licensure, the division of acute disease 11 prevention and emergency response, the division of mental 12 health and disability services, the administrator assigned to 13 control the state mental health institutes and state resource 14 centers, the administrator of mental health and disability 15 services, the division to which the director of DHS had 16 assigned responsibility for income and service programs, the 17 administrator of the child support recovery unit, and the 18 division of adult, children, and family services. Instead, 19 the references are changed so that HHS, the director of HHS, 20 or a designee is responsible for these functions.
