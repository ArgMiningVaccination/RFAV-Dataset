Hepatitis B is a serious disease. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause short-term (acute) illness that leads to: loss of appetite diarrhea and vomiting tiredness jaundice (yellow skin or eyes) pain in muscles, joints, and stomach It can also cause long-term (chronic) illness that leads to: liver damage (cirrhosis) liver cancer death About 1.25 million people in the U.S, have chronic HBV infection. Each year it is estimated that: 80,000 people, mostly young adults, get infected with HBV More than 11,000 people have to stay in the hospital because of hepatitis B 4,000 to 5,000 people die from chronic hepatitis B Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B. It is the first anti-cancer vaccine because it can prevent a form of liver cancer. 2 How is hepatitis B virus spread? Hepatitis B virus is spread through contact with the blood and body fluids of an infected person. A person can get infected in several ways, such as: by having unprotected sex with an infected person by sharing needles when injecting illegal drugs by being stuck with a used needle on the job during birth when the virus passes from an infected mother to her baby About 1/3 of people who are infected with hepatitis B in the United States don't know how they got it.

The risk of hepatitis B vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting hepatitis B vaccine is much safer than getting hepatitis B disease. Most people who get hepatitis B vaccine do not have any problems with it. Mild problems soreness where the shot was given, lasting a day or two (up to 1 out of 11 children and adolescents, and about 1 out of 4 adults) mild to moderate fever (up to 1 out of 14 children and adolescents and 1 out of 100 adults) Severe problems serious allergic reaction (very rare) 6 What if there is a moderate or severe reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a serious allergic reaction, high fever or unusual behavior. Serious allergicreactions are extremely rare with any vaccine. If one were to occur, it would be within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. Signs can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form.
