FROM AROMATHERAPY AROMATICA was established by an aromatherapist in 2004. The natural fragrant essential oils used by AROMATICA are the basic raw material of aromatherapy. They are 100% pure and natural essential oils - extracted from flowers, leaves, stems, roots, fruits, skin, and resin depending on the plant. Since ancient times, essential oils have been used as natural remedy to keep the body, mind, and spirit healthy and to enhance autoimmunity. Recently, they are gaining popularity again as a form of alternative medicine. In addition to essential oils, AROMATICA's products blend natural raw materials from all over the world, extracted using various aromatherapy methods. "}
