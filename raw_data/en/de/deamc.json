But having information can help us to prepare for the physical and emotional changes that we might be experiencing. i know from personal experience it can be a time of great uncertainty and stress - much of which can be avoided by simply knowing what's going on and how and why things may change. This booklet from Marie curie cancer care and Macmillan cancer support aims to fill that information gap. it's called End of life: The facts and provides a practical guide to the wide range of situations and issues which face many patients and carers, particularly those making the choice to stay at home. End of life care is a sensitive subject, but i believe there is a tremendous value in feeling fully informed and involved in making decisions - big and small.

These can include worry, anxiety, panic, anger, resentment, sadness and depression. Their feelings and emotions may change very quickly. it's natural to be worried or anxious when you're facing death and it can help to talk about this with your carers. You may also feel the loss of your health and worry about the loss of your role in your family or with friends. sometimes it's very difficult to talk to the people close to you and you may want to talk to someone outside of your situation. if you have a specialist nurse, they can talk to you about your feelings. This can help you understand and deal with your situation. some people prefer to talk to a person they don't know, such as trained counsellor. if you'd like to see a trained counsellor, your Gp can refer you. Many support organisations (see pages 75-89) can also help and some have helplines you can call. Talking to a religious or spiritual adviser can also help to reduce your fear and anxiety, even if you've not attended religious services or had contact with spiritual leaders in the past. Many people become withdrawn. for some people this may be due to depression and your doctor or nurse can suggest ways of dealing with this. however, as you become more ill it's common to feel that you are losing interest in the things and the people around you, even close family. This is a natural part of gradually withdrawing from the world. 30 Mac Millan canc Er suppor T / Mari E curi E canc Er carEThE las T fEw w EEK s of lif E / End of lif E: Th E facTs sometimes it's very difficult to talk to the people close to you and you may want to talk to someone outside of your situation.

Try to reduce light and noise at night. have a hot drink before going to bed, but avoid caffeine and alcohol at night time. Keep your bedroom for sleeping. if you wake during the night, go to another room in the house. if you need to sleep during the day, go to your bed and sleep. if you wake at night, don't toss and turn. Get up and go to another room. have a hot drink if you like. when you feel sleepy, go back to bed again. avoid using any screen, such as a TV screen or computer screen, for one hour before going to bed. Keep a 'worry' book so that if you wake at night you can write down the things you are worried about. You can then work through your list of worries during the day and get support and advice from your carers or your doctor or nurse. Try using relaxation techniques at night - you may find it helpful to use a relaxation tape or listen to some soothing music. if you find touch and massage helpful, you could ask your carer to give your hands or feet a gentle massage.Tell your doctor or nurse if you're not sleeping well.34 Mac Millan canc Er suppor T / Mari E curi E canc Er carEThE las T fEw w EEK s of lif E / End of lif E: Th E facTs pain not everyone gets pain, but if you do it can be reassuring to know there are effective ways of controlling it. if you have pain, it's important to let your doctor or specialist palliative care nurse know exactly where your pain is, how it feels, and how it affects you so they can treat it effectively. painkillers Everyone feels pain differently and there are several types of painkillers for different types of pain. They include: simple painkillers, such as paracetamol and codeine anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen for such and diamorphine. painkillers are usually given as tablets, liquid medicines, or patches stuck to the skin. if you are unable to swallow or are being sick, your nurse or doctor can give you painkillers such as morphine, diamorphine and oxycodone as an injection or by using a syringe driver (see next page). not everyone gets pain, but if you do there are effective ways of controlling it.

Your nurses will change the syringe each day or when needed. *painkillers, anti-sickness, anti-anxiety and several other medicines can be given by a syringe driver. Many people worry that their pain will worsen as they near the end of their life and they'll need to take increasing doses of strong painkillers such as morphine. it's important to remember that there's no such thing as a 'right dose' of morphine. The 'right' dose is the dose that gets rid of your pain. side effects of painkillers painkillers containing codeine and strong painkillers have three common side effects: drowsiness, sickness and constipation. drowsiness usually wears off after a few days, so you should be pain-free and still alert enough to do all that you want to do. if you feel sick, anti-sickness medicines can help, and this usually settles gradually over a few days. constipation is such a common side effect that everyone taking strong painkillers usually needs to take a laxative regularly.

Medicines, such as steroids, can sometimes help to boost your appetite. small frequent meals, consisting of your favourite foods, are likely to be most tempting. You may be able to boost your appetite by: making your food look attractive having a glass of sherry, brandy or your favourite alcoholic drink about 30 minutes before eating (remember that the effects of alcohol may increase if you're ill or taking particular medicines, so it's best to check this with your doctor) having snacks handy to nibble drinking nourishing drinks eating slowly.

Breathlessness can be very frightening but there are various ways of treating it, depending on the cause. it's important to let your doctors and nurses know if you are breathless so they can help you as soon as possible. nurses can show you and your carers the best positions for you to sit or stand to ease your breathing. You can also be taught how to breathe more effectively, how to pace your activity and how to save your energy. anxiety is very common in patients with breathlessness and this can make your breathing feel even more difficult. Your nurse can teach you ways to relax, so that you feel less anxious and breathless. There are several medicines that can be used for breathlessness, such as a very low dose of morphine. Your Gp can also arrange an oxygen supply for you at home if you need this. if breathlessness is caused by a build-up of fluid around your lungs (pleural effusion), the fluid can be drained off. if it's caused by anaemia (a low red blood cell count), then your doctor may arrange for you to have a blood transfusion (see next page).Breathlessness can be very frightening but there are various ways of treating it.

Y ou may want to have someone there to support you. it may help to ask them to contact other people to let them know, if you don't feel up to telling them. a spiritual or religious adviser can also support you and carry out any processes or rituals that are important to you and your relative or friend. This chapter gives you information about: what your Gp will do what your funeral director will do planning a funeral and burial or a cremation registering the death how grief might affect youYou may have lots of overwhelming emotions.66 Mac Millan canc Er suppor T / Mari E curi E canc Er carEafTEr ThE dEaTh / End of lif E: Th E facTs whaT Your G p will do You will need to tell your relative's or friend's Gp about their death within a few hours. The Gp or a community nurse will come as soon as possible to verify the death. if your Gp comes, they will verify the death and give you a medical certificate for the cause of death with a form called notice to informant , which tells you how to register the death. if a community nurse comes, or you have to call an out-of-hours doctor, they can verify the death but you may need to get the death certificate from your Gp the following day. The doctor who certifies the death has a legal responsibility to inform the coroner if a post-mortem is needed. however, a post-mortem isn't usually necessary if the death was expected except in some cases, such as mesothelioma, where the cancer is caused by occupational exposure to asbestos. a post-mortem will usually take a few days to arrange if needed, after which you'll get a medical death certificate. This can help to give exact information about the cause of death. You will need to wait until your doctor has decided whether a post-mortem is needed before you set a date for the funeral or alternative service. when you have the medical death certificate, you need to take this to the local registrar's office to register the death (see pages 69-70).Y ou will need to tell your relative's or friend's G p about their death within a few hours.

They provide a 24-hour service and can advise you on what to do. details of funeral directors are in your local phone book or on the internet. You can also get information from the national association of funeral directors on page 87. when you contact the funeral director, they will come as soon as you want them to. You can let the funeral director know if you'd like them to help you look after your relative's or friend's body at home until the funeral, or whether you would like it to be taken to the funeral director's chapel of rest. You can visit the chapel of rest to be with your relative's or friend's body if you'd like to. caring for the body The funeral director will take care of your relative's or friend's body and will wash them. This process is different for different religions and cultures but usually involves carefully washing and drying the body, closing the eyelids, and making sure their mouth is supported while closed. The person's hair is tidied and sometimes washed. The funeral director will also ask if you'd like them to be dressed in any specific clothes, such as a favourite outfit. if you'd like to help the funeral directors wash and dress your relative or friend, let them know as soon as possible so they can arrange this.

This is carried out at the funeral directors. plannin G a fun Eral and Burial or a cr EMaTion funerals and memorials allow relatives and friends to pay their respects to the person who has died. it's a way of acknowledging their death and saying goodbye. You can make all the arrangements for the funeral and burial yourself if you'd like to. however, most people prefer to have the help of the funeral director. Your Gp will need to know if you're planning a cremation so they can complete the relevant paperwork. Before making any funeral arrangements, it's important to consider several issues: w hat were the wishes of the dead person? have they expressed their wishes in a will? w hat are your wishes? some people have strong religious beliefs or views about how they'd like their funeral to be carried out. other people have no religious or spiritual beliefs and may have a non-religious or humanist funeral. it's not necessary for a religious leader to conduct a funeral or memorial service. Your funeral directors or the registrar can give you information about non-religious services if you prefer. a funeral, religious or a funeral, religious or spiritual service can be held wherever you wish.End of lif E: Th E facTs / afTEr ThE dEaTh Mac Millan canc Er suppor T / Mari E curi E canc Er carE 69 spiritual service can be held wherever you wish, for example, in the person's home or in their favourite place. after the memorial service, the person's body is cremated or buried.cremation takes place in a designated crematorium. The ashes of the person are given in a container to the next of kin. You may have discussed with your loved one what they wanted to do with their ashes and you can carry out these wishes when you are ready. Burial is usually in a churchyard or other designated burial place. it's also possible for people to be buried in other places, such as a garden. There are books with helpful advice and information on page 90. rEG isTErinG ThE dEaTh You need to take the medical death certificate - and birth and marriage certificates - to the registrar's office in the area where the death occurred. This needs to be done within five days (eight days in scotland). some registrars' offices have an appointment system, so check before you go. You can find the number of your local registrar's office listed under registration of births, deaths and marriages in the business section of your local phone book and it may also be on the envelope containing the death certificate. if you're not able to go yourself, another person can act as an 'informant' and register the death for you.You need to take the medical death certificate to the registrar's office in the area where the death occurred.afTEr ThE dEaTh / End of lif E: Th E facTs 70 Mac Millan canc Er suppor T / Mari E curi E canc Er carEBefore you attend the registrar's office, it's helpful to think about how many copies of the death certificate you might need. You can buy 'certified copies' for a small charge at the time of registration. These are duplicate original certified copies of entry and not photocopies. You'll usually need one certified copy for each life insurance policy or similar which you need to claim. at the registrar's office, the registrar will enter details of the death in the register and give you a certificate of burial or cremation, also known as a green form. You need to give this to the funeral director. The registrar will also give you a certificate of registration of death form (Bd8) if this is needed for social security purposes. information Your district or palliative care nurse can give you information about what to do when someone dies. The consumers' association publishes what to do when someone dies , which is available in most public libraries (see page 90). at the registrar's office, the registrar will enter details of the death in the register.End of lif E: Th E facTs / afTEr ThE dEaTh Mac Millan canc Er suppor T / Mari E curi E canc Er carE 71 how GriEf MiGhT aff EcT You Emotional effects The death of a partner, relative or close friend is an extremely difficult situation to face and you may feel very upset, anxious and distressed. immediately after the death, and for some time afterwards, you may feel numb and find it hard to believe that the person is dead. it's common to feel angry that they have died. This anger may be directed at the person themself for leaving you, or at other people, such as family members or health professionals, for not being able to save them from dying. The feeling of missing the person can be overwhelming. Many people continue to 'see' or 'hear' the person who has died, and have a strong sense of their presence. for example, some people walk into a room and have an experience of 'seeing' the person sitting in their favourite armchair. other people have vivid dreams in which they see the dead person as fit and well. These are perfectly normal experiences, although they can be shocking and upsetting. if you'd like support at this time, you can contact your Gp , specialist nurse, or a counselling service - see pages 84-86. cruse is a specific counselling service for people who have been bereaved and you can call them on 0844 477 9400.The feeling of missing the person can be overwhelming. afTEr ThE dEaTh / End of lif E: Th E facTs 72 Mac Millan canc Er suppor T / Mari E curi E canc Er carEphysical effects when someone close to you has died, it's common to have physical symptoms for some time afterwards. These can be frightening and some people say the symptoms are so strong that they worry they are seriously ill themselves. however, physical reactions are normal and can include headaches, dizziness, a dry mouth, feeling weak, tightness in the chest and throat, breathlessness and feeling sick. You may be aware that your symptoms are similar to those of your relative or friend who has just died. if any of these symptoms persist you should let your Gp know. practical help immediately after the death, while you are probably feeling numb, you may need plenty of practical help to do important tasks such as registering the death, arranging the funeral and coping with visitors. You may also need to spend some time on your own, coming to terms with what has happened. when someone close to you has died, it's common to have physical symptoms for some time afterwards.End of lif E: Th E facTs / afTEr ThE dEaTh Mac Millan canc Er suppor T / Mari E curi E canc Er carE 73 after the funeral The period of time after the funeral, when everyone has gone home and you are expected to pick up the threads of your own life, can be the hardest. it's a good idea to try not to do too much too soon. You may need time to get used to your loss and the changes this has brought about. it's important to take time to look after yourself. don't be afraid to show your emotions during the grieving process - it's perfectly natural to cry when you're thinking and talking about your loved one, and this can help you feel better. some cultures have specific practices to follow, which can help to mark each phase of the bereavement process after a person's death. You may find the book, what to do when someone dies (see page 90) helpful. it has practical advice on what to do when someone dies, and sections on: registering the death; death body donation for research.don't be afraid to show your emotions during the grieving process.74 Mac Millan canc Er suppor T / Mari E curi E canc Er carE 75 End of lif E: Th E facTs / naTional or Ganisa Tions ThaT can h Elp chap TEr 7 naTional orGanisa Tions ThaT can h Elp we've listed organisations that may be able to help you.
