Liver shrinkage diet (LRD) is a diet based on low energy (calories), in particular low in carbohydrate and fat. By following a liver shrinkage diet, your body will be forced to use up the stored carbohydrate (glycogen) from the liver. The glycogen and a quantity of water will leave the liver, and therefore liver will shrink and become softer, more flexible and easier to move during surgery. During laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery the liver has to be lifted out of the way to access the stomach lying beneath it. Most people needing bariatric surgery have a large, fatty liver which can cause difficulty for keyhole surgery. A large, fatty liver makes it harder for the surgeon to see and gain access to the stomach underneath. This can increase the duration of your surgery and therefore your time under general anaesthetic. It can also be dangerous as your liver could bleed heavily during surgery or there could be injury to other organs. If this happens the surgeon may have to do open surgery instead of keyhole surgery. If you do not follow the liver shrinkage diet and your liver has not shrunk, surgery may be deemed unsafe and the surgeon may cancel the surgery on the day.

We do not recommend taking Lactulose during pre-op liver shrinkage diet. - Patients on insulin or gliclazide (tablets): If you have diabetes and take insulin injections or gliclazide (tablets) please contact the person who normally helps you control your diabetes. It is likely you will need to reduce your insulin or gliclazide because the diets are all low in carbohydrate (less than 100g) and will make your blood sugars go lower than normal. Check your blood glucose levels 4 times a day. If you do not have a blood meter, you can ask to have your blood sugar checked at your local pharmacy. Please contact to your dietitian if you experience regular hypo's (low blood sugar levels). - It is expected that you experience some weight loss during liver shrinkage diet.
