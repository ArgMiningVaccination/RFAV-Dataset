Indication: Active immunization of patients 12 mo of age and older against disease caused by hepatitis A virus. VAQTA is indicated for active pre-exposure prophylaxis against disease caused by hepatitis A virus in persons 2 years of age and older. Primary immunization should be given at least 2 weeks prior to expected exposure to HAV. Individuals who are or will be at increased risk of infection by HAV include: TRAVELERS Persons traveling to areas of higher endemicity for hepatitis A. These areas include, but are not limited to, Africa, Asia (except Japan), the Mediterranean basin, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central and South America, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean. Current CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) advisories should be consulted with regard to specific locales.

Hemophiliacs and other recipients of therapeutic blood products (see and ). Persons who test positive for hepatitis C virus and have diagnosed liver disease. Although the epidemiology of hepatitis A does not permit the identification of other specific populations at high risk of disease, outbreaks of hepatitis A or exposure to hepatitis A virus have been described in a variety of populations in which VAQTA may be useful: Certain institutional workers (e.g., caretakers for the developmentally challenged) Employees of child day-care centers Laboratory workers who handle live hepatitis A virus Handlers of primate animals that may be harboring HAV PEOPLE EXPOSED TO HEPATITIS A For those requiring both immediate and long-term protection, VAQTA may be administered concomitantly with IG. Revaccination See. Use With Other Vaccines VAQTA may be given concomitantly at separate injection sites with typhoid and yellow fever vaccines. The GMTs for hepatitis A when VAQTA, typhoid and yellow fever vaccines were administered concomitantly were reduced when compared to VAQTA alone. Following receipt of the booster dose of VAQTA, the GMTs for hepatitis A in these two groups were observed to be comparable. (See, and.) The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has stated that limited data from studies conducted among adults indicate that simultaneous administration of hepatitis A vaccine with diphtheria, poliovirus (oral and inactivated), tetanus, oral typhoid, cholera, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, or yellow fever vaccine does not decrease the immune response to either vaccine or increase the frequency of reported adverse events. Studies indicate that hepatitis B vaccine can be administered with VAQTA without affecting immunogenicity or increasing the frequency of adverse events. Use With Immune Globulin For individuals requiring either post-exposure prophylaxis or combined immediate and longer-term protection (e.g., travelers departing on short notice to endemic areas), VAQTA may be administered concomitantly with IG using separate sites and syringes (see and ). \"HAVpur - Pharmacology: Provides active immunization against hepatitis A.
