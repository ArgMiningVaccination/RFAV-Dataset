What is SIBO? Intestinal bacteria and intestinal flora have various effects on human health. Many diverse bacteria inhabit the intestine, but the condition in which intestinal bacteria overgrow in the small intestine, which is initially small in number, is called intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome SIBO. There are many different causes of this SIBO, but the following are possible causes. - Food poisoning: Bacterial infections can disrupt the intestinal flora balance and gastrointestinal peristalsis. - Indigestion: low secretion of stomach acid, digestive lactose intolerance, gluten intolerance, etc. - Western-style high-fat diet: Causes an increase in the incidence of unhealthy bacteria in the intestinal flora. - Decreased peristalsis: Digested food and bacteria in the small intestine must be pushed into the large intestine by peristalsis. If this peristaltic movement is not done correctly, the bacteria will have the opportunity to multiply in the small intestine. - Ileocecal valve dysfunction: The ileocecal valve is located between the small and large intestines and prevents backflow from the large to the small intestine. Since many bacteria live in the large intestine, many bacteria also invade the small intestine when reflux occurs. Treatment approach of SIBO SIBO is not a disease that can be cured in a short period, so it is necessary to approach it from various angles and improve it little by little over a long period. - Remove Reduce the growth of bacteria: Berberine, oregano oil, clove oil, thyme oil, garlic, golden seal, etc., has a strong effect. - Restore Restore peristaltic and ileocecal valve functions: It is necessary to review lifestyle habits such as reducing stress, getting enough sleep, and exercising moderately. - Replenish Improvement of low stomach acid secretion and digestive Digestive enzyme and be supplemented. - Recurrence prevention Preventing recurrence: You can prevent recurrence by improving the diet and taking probiotics.

Thanks to this supplement, I feel very refreshed every day. I will continue to take care of my diet and aim to have a healthy gastrointestinal tract. I feel very fortunate to have met Dr. Ozawa through his blog. I would like to continue to have a good relationship with Dr. Ozawa's supplements. Thank you very much. - Love this brand! This supplement works! I take one tablet three times a day, following the directions on the dosage guidelines! - Product as expected I feel like it is very beneficial. It works great for keeping my gut healthy. - worked well for my gums! After about 3 months, my SIBO improved. I kept the rest of the capsule and remembered reading something about oregano being good for swollen gums, so I took the contents out of the capsule and rubbed it on with a cotton swab, and the gum swellings went away. My gums swell easily, so I'm glad I found a good way to treat them. "}
