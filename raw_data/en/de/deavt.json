Children may get \"mini-mumps\" with swelling in the jaw area in the third week after vaccination. These are not contagious.

Your child already received vaccines to protect against diphtheria, polio, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, mumps and rubella as a baby. Immunity to these diseases reduces over time so a booster dose is recommended now to provide additional protection. Your child's immune system can easily cope with these vaccines. These vaccines are given together to give your child the best protection against these diseases.How do you get these vaccines for your child? These vaccines are offered as part of the HSE school immunisation programme. You will receive details and a consent form before your child is vaccinated. In Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim these vaccines are given by your GP. In these counties you will receive a letter from the HSE asking you to attend your GP when the vaccines are due. Can my child get the COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines? As a precaution, it is advised that for children in this age group, the COVID-19 vaccine and any other vaccine are separated by 14 days.
