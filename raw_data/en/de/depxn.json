N-803 (generic name nogapendekin alfa in Aricept ((NAI)) is a novel [IL-15 superagonist complex](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29392336/) consisting of an IL-15 to an IL-15 receptor /IgG1 Fc fusion protein. Its mechanism of action is direct specific stimulation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells through [beta gamma](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31994778/) T-cell receptor binding avoiding [T-reg stimulation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2784904/). The cytokine [interleukin-15](https://immunitybio.com/nejm-evidence-publishes-results-for-immunitybios-quilt-3-032-registrational-trial-of-il-15-superagonist-n-803-plus-bcg-in-patients-with-bladder-cancer/) (IL-15) plays a crucial role in the immune system by affecting the development, maintenance, and function of the natural killer (NK) and T cells. The n-803 has improved pharmacokinetic properties, longer persistence in lymphoid tissues, and enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to native, non-complexed IL-15 in vivo. The superagonist N-803 has been studied in more than [700 patients](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221110006024/en/) in multiple phases 1 and 2 [clinical trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02138734?term=QUILT+2.005&draw=2&rank=2) in liquid and solid tumors. In addition to the [study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03022825?term=quilt+3.032&draw=2&rank=2) in NMIBC, it is currently being studied in trials for pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and HIV. On November 10, 2022, the peer-review journal [NEJM](https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/EVIDoa2200167) Evidence published its conclusion from a [phase 2/3](https://immunitybio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ASCO-GU-2022.pdf) study: In patients with BCG-unresponsive bladder carcinoma in situ and papillary NMIBC treated with BCG and the novel agent NAI, CRs were achieved with the persistence of effect, cystectomy avoidance, and 100% bladder cancer-specificity survival at 24 months. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved [TICE\u00ae BCG](https://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/t/tice_bcg/ticebcg_pi.pdf) vaccine from Merck is used in this therapy. \"The peer review and publication of data in [NEJM Evidence](https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/EVIDoa2200167) highlight the significance of the positive results of the QUILT 3.032 trial in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC,\" said Patrick Soon-Shiong, M.D., Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer at ImmunityBio, in a [press release](https://immunitybio.com/nejm-evidence-publishes-results-for-immunitybios-quilt-3-032-registrational-trial-of-il-15-superagonist-n-803-plus-bcg-in-patients-with-bladder-cancer/) on November 10, 2022. \"These data further our understanding of N-803's unique role in potentially boosting the proliferation of natural killer and T cells while synergistically enhancing BCG efficacy.\" On December 27, 2022, an [editorial](https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/EVIDe2200264) from [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/) stated: \"The efficacy and minimal toxicity of this combination represents a major advance for the care of patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, and the authors should be congratulated. In addition, this promising combination offers a potential alternative to cystectomy and may allow us to move beyond single-arm studies toward randomized phase 3 trials against other novel therapies.\" Based in Culver City, CA, [ImmunityBio](https://immunitybio.com/) is a vertically integrated, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases.

U.S. FDA Review N-803 Plus BCG Therapy The U.S. FDA is reviewing ( 2022](https://immunitybio.com/immunitybio-announces-fda-acceptance-of-biologics-license-application-for-n-803-in-bcg-unresponsive-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-carcinoma-in-situ/)) Biologics License Application ( plus BCG for the treatment of NMIBC CIS with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act ( [PDUFA](https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/prescription-drug-user-fee-amendments#:~:text=The%20Prescription%20Drug%20User%20Fee%20Act%20(PDUFA)%20was%20created%20by,of%20certain%20prescription%20drug%20products.)) date of May 23, 2023.

Patients with intermediate or high-risk NMIBC typically receive a treatment of transurethral resection of the bladder tumor ( [TURBT](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/bladder-cancer/treating/surgery.html)) followed instillation. However, cancer in 30% to 40% of patients with NMIBC despite adequate treatment with BCG. Moreover, even among those in whom a complete response is achieved with BCG, up to 50% see their cancer return. Tri-Ad5 Vaccine Combination With N-803 On April 25, 2023, ImmunityBio, Inc.
