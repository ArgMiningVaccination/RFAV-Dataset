{"title": "Knowledge, Attitudes, and Perceptions Towards Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Among Adult Women in Primary Health Care Centers in Makkah, Saudi Arabia", "author": "Yousef M Turki; Jehad Alqurashi", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is linked to cervical cancer, which is prevalent in Saudi Arabia. While HPV vaccines are effective, their coverage remains low in low- and middle-income countries. Public awareness of HPV vaccination is also limited. The study examines public awareness of cervical cancer, HPV, the HPV vaccine, and factors that hinder vaccine uptake. Objectives: To assess the levels of knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions towards HPV vaccination among women aged 16 years and above in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using an interview questionnaire. A stratified sampling technique was used to select a representative sample of 534 female patients aged 16 years and older who visited primary healthcare centers in Makkah. The interview questionnaire included questions related to sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge about HPV vaccination, attitudes and perceptions toward HPV vaccination, and sources of information about HPV infection and vaccines. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests. Results: The majority of participants were aged between 21 and 40 years (76.4%), Saudi (90.3%), and had a higher education level (73.4%). Only a small proportion (1.9%-39%) of participants correctly answered most of the questions related to HPV vaccination, while a few questions were answered correctly by a larger proportion (41.6%-59.6%), highlighting the need for educational programs to increase awareness about the HPV vaccine. The internet and social media were the most prevalent sources of information about HPV infection and vaccines (48.4%). A majority of participants expressed willingness to receive the HPV vaccine if offered by the healthcare sector at no cost (65.5%). Concerns included fear of injection (27.7%), cost (23.2%), and potential refusal from family or community (9.7%). A significant proportion believed that there is a need for educational sessions to increase awareness about the HPV vaccine in their community (82.8%) and that increased knowledge about HPV vaccines would lead to greater acceptability (83.9%). Age, nationality, marital status, number of children, educational status, occupation, and average monthly income were significantly associated with knowledge about HPV vaccination (p < 0.05). Age and educational status were significantly associated with attitudes towards HPV vaccination (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The lack of knowledge about HPV vaccination among adult women in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, is concerning, as it may result in low vaccine uptake rates and an increased incidence of HPV-related diseases. Therefore, targeted educational programs and awareness campaigns are crucial to enhance knowledge and promote the uptake of the HPV vaccine. These programs should be designed to provide accurate information about the prevalence of HPV, its associated risks, and the benefits of vaccination.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-08-26", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
