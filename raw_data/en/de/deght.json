We offer specialized cultural teachings, ceremonies, storytelling, doctoring, guidance, drumming, singing, and smudging, in either group and individual settings, depending on the practice. Each Elder/Healer has their own protocols, so we recommend that you speak with your traditional healing liaison before your visit. You may be required to bring tobacco, wear a skirt, bring a gift of cloth, or there may be moontime protocols. An offering of tobacco is meant for communication between you, the Elder/Healer and the Creator. You may receive recommendations to attend other ceremonies, or for traditional herbal medicines to help your recovery. Our Traditional Healers include Richard Assinewai (on leave), Elva Jamieson, Ernestine Mcleod, Joanne Cheechoo, and Sonny Hill. Location Availability Traditional Healing [Learn More](#) How to Access this Service Each location has a Traditional Healing Liaison (THL) that supports Visiting Healers, Elders and Teachers.
