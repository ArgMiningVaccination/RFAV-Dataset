Take a Covid test. If it's positive, stay home, and let me know with as much advance notice as possible. My policy is you must give me at least 24\u2014hrs cancellation notice to avoid being charged a cancellation fee. If you are feeling a bit under the weather, but would continue daily activities, please keep your appointment, wear a mask, and let me know so that I can wear a mask too. If you are feeling so ill you need to stay in bed, let me know as soon as possible, and in this case, stay home. If you cancel last-minute, your session cannot be booked by someone else, so you will need to pay a cancellation fee. Please keep in mind that I offer a limited number of sessions per week, and missed sessions greatly affect my sustainability and ability to keep my business healthy so I can offer everyone good care. I prefer several days of notice if you need to cancel for scheduling reasons. Please do not wait until 24 hours if you can help it. My cancellation fee is $55. No-shows (with less than 24 hr notice or with no correspondence) will be charged in full. MAY 2023 Masks are now optional. I'm happy to put one on for you. I'll take it as a signal if you are wearing one when you get here. Still cleaning between patients and running the HEPA air filter. Onward! MARCH 28, 2022 We are still wearing masks and cleaning between sessions and taking all Covid precautions. As before, you must switch to Telehealth or else reschedule if you have any Covid-possible symptoms at the time of your session. As much advance notice as possible is much appreciated. If you have knowingly been exposed, please let me know asap and reschedule. Thank you! Nov. 13, 2021 UPDATE I'm tripled vaxed and still taking all Covid precautions for you, continuing with us both wearing masks, cleaning the table between patients, running the air filters all day (in addition to the HVAC) and running on lower capacity so that there is space between sessions. As before, if you are sick (with any respiratory condition or sudden severe headache or digestive issue), let me know as soon as possible, and we will move to Telehealth or else reschedule. You must reschedule if you have been exposed to Covid, and you must let me know if you test positive following having been in for a session. Doing what I can to keep us all safe. Wishing you well. Love seeing you when you come in! As a reminder, if it's important to you to know someone's pandemic response to feel safe in their presence or under their care, just ask them. SEPT 3, 2021 UPDATE It's been eighteen months since we had to rapidly adapt to a new way of being, witnessing the alarming effects of a new virus threatening each of our bodies as it made its way to every corner of the world. Never has it been made more clear that we are global citizens. We are very lucky in the United States to have easy and free access to effective vaccinations. I was fortunate to be trained by doctors, mostly from China, who practiced both Eastern and Western medicine, with a high regard for the contributions of both modern science and traditional pre-modern medicine. We were taught the strengths and shortcomings of both practices, and how an integrative approach serves us best. For example, we refer out to Western medicine for things like antibiotics for infections, and while we are trained to use Chinese herbs in these cases, with something as dangerous as an infection, we know the tried-and-true method of antibiotics is the most safe and effective way for the patient to heal. We know that Western medicine falls short in what is has to offer for pain management and inflammatory conditions, to name just two examples, and that's where Eastern medicine comes through with our strong resources and multi-layered approach. My training has taught me to support this vaccine and to respect that vaccines are a tried-and-true public health approach that reduce risk of viral transmission and prevent severe illness and death. We are all in this together. Health care is a basic right that many in our community do not get. In our broken system, not everyone has access to modalities to stay well and safe. Furthermore, no one is exempt from the risk of catching or transmitting Covid, no matter how healthy one considers oneself to be. Evidence has shown us over and over that getting as many people fully vaccinated as quickly as possible is the best, fairest, most safe and effective way to combat this pandemic. * * * Not all providers share this belief and some are still not vaccinated. This is a reminder, if it's important to you, to ask your other providers how they are responding to the pandemic so you that are informed when you seek their care. AUG 2021 UPDATE While I received my second COVID vaccination early February, I am still taking all precautions for you as before: mask wearing, reduced schedule to disinfect between patients, vigilance around hand washing and cleaning, and constantly running HVAC and Hepa air filter. You can schedule your session online here on this site for an in-person visit or virtual Telehealth (recommended for herbal prescriptions, artist assistance, and custom guided visualization and somatic language work). For house calls, please email or call to schedule. Looking forward to seeing you! Same goes as before: IF YOU FEEL AT ALL SICK, or have been EXPOSED to illness (diagnosed Covid or not), you must not come in to the office, and we will meet on video Telehealth instead. There we will assess your symptoms and I will do all I can to assist you from afar. You must call or text me before your session if either of the above are the case. Also, if you fall ill in the two weeks following your session, I ask that you let me know asap. If anyone in your household has symptoms or has tested positive, we will reschedule your appointment. Please inform me as soon as possible. JUNE 2020 UPDATE COVID PRECAUTIONS & CHANGES I am back in the office seeing patients. I'm working on a reduced schedule with larger gaps between patients to account for disinfection time and to assure that people don't cross paths coming or going. I'd love to see you. You can schedule as before \u2014 on the link above marked SCHEDULE \u2014 and then \"Request an Appointment.\" From now on, we both wear masks and we keep our distance while talking. I ask you to wash or sanitize your hands when you come in and if you've touched your face. I do the same for you. I now have time blocked off between patients to disinfect. Before your session, the table, my computer, and my phone are disinfected. I'm running HVAC and an air filter the whole time. Other changes include: no hugs (sorry!) or handshakes, and the table is bare without the usual heating pad. My requirements are: IF YOU FEEL AT ALL SICK, or have been EXPOSED to illness (diagnosed Covid or not), you must not come in to the office, and we will meet on video Telehealth instead. There we will assess your symptoms and I will do all I can to assist you from afar. You must call or text me before your session if either of the above are the case. Also, if you fall ill in the two weeks following your session, I ask that you please let me know asap. ~~~ Other changes: For some of you, I've learned, 55 minutes is not enough time to fully sink in to a deep rest. I now have a 75 minute session option you can choose. I am continuing to offer HOUSE CALLS. These can be done for individuals or for multiple people in a household. You save $ when I treat all of you together in the same room \u2014 and it makes for a unique shared experience. I am only doing house calls for single family homes since Covid-19, not apartment buildings. So sorry about that. It's the only way I can manage risk reduction for everyone's benefit for now. I am offering my services pro bono to leaders in the PDX Black Lives Matter Movement. If you would not like to come in-person, you can schedule a Telehealth virtual video session on my scheduling link. You might be surprised how much we can do online. I've received additional training this Spring in language-based somatic methods used to open, resolve, and shift old patterns held from emotional wounds in our body-psyche. Some of you know, this can bring about surprising and profound relief! If you would like this kind of work integrated into your in-person session, just let me know. MaY 18th UPDATE: Slow + CAreful REOPENING Hello friends and fans of acupuncture and Body Land Metaphor Medicine, I hope this finds you safe and well. We are in a gigantic global transition right now. We have so much upheaval and change highlighting a lot of old patterns of: inequity, insecurity, fear of the unknown, isolation, grief and loss. Alongside newness and growth and deepening connectivity, community, graciousness, generosity, love, rest, and restoration. We are seeing these patterns emerge in our bodies, psyches, societies, and communities, and in the planet too. What a time to be alive. How is this affecting your body, mind and spirit? My heart goes out to those of you who are grieving and suffering due to illness and death in your circles. Our society is hurting immeasurably from the many losses of those we cherish who have perished. * * * Here in Portland, Oregon, we are starting to go back to work, slowly and carefully. I'm including a list here of my offerings, so share with you now. There are quite a few ways we can work together, near, and afar, if you feel called to do so. I offer: 1. Telemedicine video sessions for your health and wellbeing 2. Creative support for artists, energy work for your creative projects on the phone 3. Body Land Metaphor Medicine guided visualizations - free on your podcast apps 4. Subtle Body Breakthrough Coaching through the Body Wisdom Academy 5. (AND FINALLY AGAIN -- YAY!) In-person hands-on acupuncture/acupressure transformative experiences - in my studio or in your home *** I've really missed seeing you all. I love my job. I love what we do together in session. It's been hard to be apart. Things feel like they are shifting a bit. Oregon cases are still quite low. The governor has allowed us to step back into our studios, offices, and storefronts. * * * Would you like to come into the studio for a session? Check in with your body. If you get a YES, you can [schedule](https://lizgreenhill.clientsecure.me/) your next appointment now. I have put disinfecting measures in place to create a safe space. I am spacing appointments out with time to clean thoroughly between patients. I appreciate if you bring a mask but if you forget I have extras. I'm not working on faces for right now. There's a hand sanitizer bottle on every table for both of us to use. The studio feels a little different but our work together is still strong and sensitive, and customized for your optimal healing experience. As before, since mid-March, I am *requiring* that anyone scheduled to come in who notices any symptoms of a fever, respiratory illness, rash, red eyes, or unusual stiff neck or headache, let me know and do not come in. We will shift to telemedicine and reschedule your in-person session. This is essential to keeping our space safe, so please do respect it. Cancellation fees are waived of course if suspected illness presents. What if you are feeling the call to work together but are not ready to come back in? No problem! I am offering telemedicine sessions and they are awesome. Who knew how much qi we could move together through telemedicine? I've been wowed. I'd love to try it with you. I have *new techniques* to guide you through moving out energetic blocks in your own body and you get to keep these techniques like a souvenir of magical alchemy. I would love to offer you that. You still sign up on my website, just select the Telehealth option. Insurance is covering telemedicine same as in-person, so don't be shy. [Schedule](https://lizgreenhill.clientsecure.me/) here. House calls are also an option! However, I am only doing house calls right now in single family homes. I'm sorry about that! That's just way I can manage to keep tracking under control for now. If I see multiple people at once in your home, I'll waive the house call fee for you. If you need a session but the cost is a prohibitive, please let me know. Phone-based creativity artist assistance sessions are available as before. As an extra incentive to try virtual work (both video telemedicine AND phone call artistic support) -- I am, for a limited time, offering *PACKAGE DEALS*! A 3-pack of long-distance sessions is $265 (Regularly $375) Sessions must all be used within 5 weeks. I recommend 3 weeks right in a row. This offer is good through July 1. I'm getting creative about how to make up for lost time, so if you happen to be feeling the glare from blank walls at home and have ever wanted to purchase [art](http://www.lizasch.com/) from me -- prices have never been this low! Hit me up and I'll share with you what I have for sale. Stay safe. Please let your community know if you need help. And that includes me. Sending all my best wishes to you-- Liz P.S. If you use social media, please follow me to keep in touch: Instagram: liz_nightsky, metaphor_medicine Facebook: Night Sky Acupuncture BODY LAND is available on Spotify, Apple podcasts, Stitcher, and my website For the time being, all sessions will be via Telemedicine on my HIPPA secure portal. Please schedule as you usually do, opting for the Telemedicine appointment. Looking forward to continuing our work together. COVID-19 UPDATES + INFORMATION March 21, 2020 Stay home, stay six feet apart, stay informed, stay connected. I am here for you and will continue to work with you online from a safe distance. STAY HOMe & SIX FEET APART Night Sky Acupuncture has moved online. This was a very difficult decision. I looked to advisories coming from experts around the globe, my teachers of Chinese Medicine, the American Society of Acupuncturists, and local government \u2014 and the consensus is, I need to not work in-person with people for the next 2 weeks, and then reassess. This is a very hard call to make as hands-on medicine has much to offer all of us right now. However, putting me and you in a room together increases the risk of spreading this very highly contagious disease. The number one thing we need to focus on is to minimize the spread. I have been isolating since March 11, when I first felt slightly sick, but I have had groceries and mail delivered so I cannot guarantee zero exposure. With no available testing, I have no evidence as to whether I was sick with COVID-19 or not \u2014 and little is still known about immunity, antibodies, continued contagion, and multiple strains. Virtually, we can connect. I can hear your health concerns and advise, prescribe herbs and kitchen remedies, teach you acupressure, breathing techniques, qi moving tactics, and we can do interactive customized guided visualizations together. These are not frivolous measures; I know they will help you immensely. The time will come when it's safe for us to work together in person. And, like you, I hope it is soon. In the meantime, please contact me if you need help with your care. I welcome new clients this way too. You can sign up for Telehealth sessions with me (as you do in person session, on my [portal](https://lizgreenhill.clientsecure.me/home)) in 20 or 60 minute sessions at a reduced rate ($25 marked down from $42/$75 marked down from $125). *** If you need medical care\u2014 call your primary doctor or a nurse hotline first. Let them advise you what to do and where to go. If their suggestions feel unsafe, please be in touch. I'll try to help you figure out a better plan. If you need emergency care\u2014 you must get seen. If you don't know where to turn to, you can call me to advise and I'll do my best to help you, though this is out of my scope of expertise. I am far from a first line of advice for emergency care. STAY INFORMED Here is a list of articles and presentations I found to be intelligent and reliable and informative. The latest advice from [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) (World Health Organization).

To better understand origin, contagion and viral spread, [this Atlantic article](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/03/biography-new-coronavirus/608338/) explains a lot. STAY CONNECTED Isolation need not be isolating. This is a time to reach out to people we care about via phone, text or internet video, and to consider what we can creatively offer others from home using the resources we have been gifted with\u2014material or immaterial. Let's use our innovative thinking skills to contribute what we can to others. Look for ways to help out, including: sewing masks, donating supplies, volunteering, and Support your local farmers, CSAs, delivery services sending out everything from bread (StarterBread.com) to food (OrganicstoYou.com) to toilet paper.
