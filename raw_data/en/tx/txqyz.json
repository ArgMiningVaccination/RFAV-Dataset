In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the different COVID-19 vaccines and their potential side effects, so you can make an informed decision about your health. The Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive emergency use authorization from the FDA. It is a two-dose vaccine that is administered 21 days apart. According to clinical trials, the most common side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine include: - Pain and swelling at the injection site - Fatigue - Headache - Muscle pain - Chills - Fever These side effects are generally mild to moderate and go away on their own within a few days. However, in rare cases, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been associated with severe allergic reactions. The Moderna Vaccine The Moderna vaccine is another two-dose vaccine that is administered 28 days apart. Like the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, it has been shown to be highly effective at preventing COVID-19. The most common side effects of the Moderna vaccine include: - Pain and swelling at the injection site - Fatigue - Headache - Muscle pain - Chills - Fever These side effects are similar to those of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and are generally mild to moderate. However, in rare cases, the Moderna vaccine has also been associated with severe allergic reactions.

The most common side effects of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine include: - Pain and swelling at the injection site - Headache - Fatigue - Muscle aches - Nausea These side effects are generally mild to moderate and go away on their own within a few days. However, like the other COVID-19 vaccines, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been associated with severe allergic reactions in rare cases. Which Vaccine Has the Least Side Effects?
