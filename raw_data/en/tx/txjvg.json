Experts around the world collectively say 'Yes '. Mandatory vaccinations have proven, several times throughout history, to be incredibly helpful and at times crucial to the well-being of the human race. Mandating certain vaccines has saved entire nations from disaster and defeat. The lack of vaccinations and medical treatment for some viruses has wiped out populations as a whole. Disease can overthrow a culture and spread like wildfire when not taken precaution against. However, there exists a fierce opposition against the mandate of vaccination by some groups of interest with the existence of adverse effects by vaccination to the human body as a reason. Although vaccination carries some health risks, Mandatory vaccinations for children in public schools have been the center of much debate since laws were first developed to regulate immunization. Fears from parents about side effects and adverse reactions have steered many away from wanting to vaccinate their children despite the numerous infectious diseases they prevent. These debates have gotten in the way of progression in schools for preventing the spread of disease. To me, the risks of not vaccinating children are far greater than the risks of adverse reactions. Parents who don't vaccinate their children put them and others at risk because it allows normally preventable disease to continue to spread. Needles are a big hazard if not thrown away after use. If they are left lying around someone else it can pass on symptoms if they someone who used it before had diabetes or maybe even HIV, it can even cause an infection. This is a health hazard. Another hazard is if there is no hygiene in the hospital, someone could become seriously ill. For example if nurses or doctors don't wash their hands after helping another patient and then move on to the next, the patient could catch something. Another harm is that another infection could be passed on if the room has not been wiped down someone else could come down and lie down and catch the infection which makes it a health hazard. Infection control refers to action devoted to policies and procedures that reduce the risk of spreading infections, reduce the occurrence of diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, parasite. The infectious diseases are normally spread by human to human, human to animal contact or by ingestion of food, droplet in the air, and contact with a surface that is the vehicle of the infective agent. H1N1, commonly known as the swine flu, a viral infection, was a cause of 2009 world-wide pandemic. The virus was first found in pigs, but a similar virus also found in humans. The virus spreads in a same manner as any other seasonal flu, mainly by droplets (small particles in the air) when an infected person coughs, sneezes or even talks, but also by touching An Outbreak at the Michigan State University is my next medical investigation. I was called to the campus to investigate the outbreak and all of its victims. There are 9 patients they are suspected to be victims of the outbreak. Sue, Jill, Marco, Maria, Maggie, Alvin, Arnie, Anthony, and Wanda. The patients came into the campus infirmary worried about their symptoms. Each patient has agreed to testing except for Arnie. The patients have similar symptoms but the symptoms were presented in a different way. I thus had to investigate, diagnose, treat, and produce a prevention plan on how to attack this outbreak that is affecting the campus environment. Staphylococcus epidermidis is the organism that was identified based on the tests that I had conducted. The tests that I used to identify this organism were the coagulase test and the catalase test. My bacterium was beta hemolytic as well. First, a gram stain had to be done to determine whether the organism was a gram positive organism or a gram negative organism. This determined which set of tests that had to be done. My bacterium turned out to be gram positive. When conducting these tests, I only had to do the coagulase test and the catalase test because when doing the catalase test, the reaction was that it had bubbled. If it did not bubble, or have a positive reaction, then I would not have had to do the coagulase test. Also, since my bacterium caused a positive catalase test, I only had to do the coagulase test and no other tests. This is because with staphylococcus organisms, these are the only tests On the other hand, Bihr gains an audience related advantage of safety values when she addresses the topic of protecting children from harm; Bihr explains that administering vaccines helps protect children from illnesses like the influenza virus or rotavirus. Researchers Ferdinands et al. (2014) found that the \"...influenza vaccination was associated with about a three-quarters reduction in risk of influenza-related critical illness in children...Our results highlight the value of increasing the use of influenza vaccines among children\" (Ferdinands et al., 2014, p. 681); while Dr. Cave's (2014) piece, Adolescent refusal of MMR inoculation: F (mother) v F (father), adds that \"A global vaccination campaign has led to a 71 per cent drop in measles-related deaths between 2000 and 2011, making a huge impact on the death rate which was estimated at 2.6 million deaths per year in the 1980s\" (Cave, 2014, p. 631). In both sources, vaccinations were statistically proven to reduce the risks of illnesses and appeals to those who agree that vaccinations are a safe option for protection, giving support to Bihr's push for vaccinations. Since the invention of vaccines, it has created a huge impact worldwide. As a child begins to start school, their required by the state to receive their twelve routine shots. The children who receive all their shots have a greater chance of not contracting any diseases. Throughout the years, vaccination or otherwise known as immunization has been a hugely controversial issue worldwide and whether or not to vaccinate children. However, vaccines are an effective and key role in keeping the human population healthy and safe. \"Wild Geese\" by Mary Oliver is a poem about letting things go and appreciating just how simple and beautiful life is. Oliver claims that \"You do not have to be good...\" and that you only have to \"love what [you] love...\" meaning that as human being one should enjoy life and live it how he or she sees fit. Oliver continues her poem by convincing the reader that life should not be taken too seriously. By re-using the word, \"meanwhile...\"Oliver let's the reader know that not only their life is going on at a particular time, but also other's lives are shifting through time as well. I joined and participated in health promotion program offered at the University of Texas at San Antonio. It was named UTSA'S Rowdy Wellness Health Fair. It occurred today Wednesday, November 9th from 10am - 2pm located in the Sombrilla. Strep Throat is an infectious bacterial disease that is contagious and is caused by the inflammation and swelling in the lining of the mucus membranes in the back of the throat and the tonsils. The throat gets a burning sensation and a severe irritation, causing a sudden, severe sore throat. Strep throat generally affects the throat and tonsils and makes swallowing hard. Sometimes a sore throat is mistaken for strep throat. Sore throats are mostly caused by a viral infection and not the streptococcal bacteria. Anton Van Leeuwenhoek discovered the microscope which lead the microbiologist and scientist to discover the streptococcal bacteria which causes strep throat. The symptoms of strep throat are a quick , painful sore throat, pain when you swallow, a high fever of a 101 degrees F , you Clinical governance ensures that organisations become accountable for continuously improving their services and safe-guarding standard of care 'by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish' (Scally and Donaldson 1998). Clinical audit emerged from within the clinical governance framework and is now seen as one of the most important elements of clinical governance (NICE 2002); it has been defined as 'a quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review against explicit criteria and the implementation of change'. The student intends to focus this audit on staff knowledge in relation to Hand Hygiene and Infection Control and to evaluate the hand hygiene education Many people may think that vaccination is a bad thing, that instead of preventing it causes illness, that is not natural. Natural or not, there are many reasons as to why we should vaccinate us and the younger generation. Most of the time children don't like vaccination because it hurt, but is the responsibility of a parent to seek the wellbeing of his or her child. Vaccination it's a preventive measure of various diseases. Unfortunately, things like the anti-vaccination movement, the misinformation on the Internet, and the believe that vaccination causes more damage than is worth, have led our society to think that it's right not to vaccinate. Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) is one of the most important agents in the prevention of hospital acquired infections or what we termed nosocomial infections. IPC channels every member of the hospital, which includes, healthcare providers (HCP), patients and the hospitals perse. It is important to practice IPC commandment to every hospital as well as community. The Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH) adopted the national IPC protocol. Employees working in pediatrics hospital are supposed to take precautions to protect their patients and staff from exposure to potentially infectious materials. A fundamental component of standard infection prevention measures are a system of barrier precautions to be used by all personnel Influenza viruses constitute the genus Orthomyxovirus belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, which consists of three species: A, B, and C. They are negative, single stranded RNA viruses. These viruses cause influenza also known as flu. Influenza is contagious acute respiratory disease that is marked by fever, chills, headache and feeling tired. It causes seasonal epidemics during winter mostly in the United States and Canada. Type C causes less severe flu compared to flu caused by type A and B. "}
