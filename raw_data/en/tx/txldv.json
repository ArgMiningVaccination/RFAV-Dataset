He said, \"You know, it's really not about you healing the patient. It's about your relationship with them and being part of their healing process.\" That moment resonated deep within me, and yet I don't think I fully understood what was being said until I began working with Attunement. As I embraced energy work through Attunement, my own healing began to unfold - somewhat unexpectedly. Learning how to connect with my 'life-pattern' and release that which no longer vibrationally belonged within me, freed my spirit to take over the empty space of my form and at last I found me - the one I am. And as I heal, I observe the people that surround me beginning to heal as well. Belief systems begin to change and shift the consciousness of a person's state of health. In Attunement it is called entering the state of union. Now, as a board-certified pediatrician at the KU Integrative Medicine Program here in Kansas City, Kansas, I realize that physicians only have the tools and resources to help people. True healing comes from within the person, from their creator-being. Human Beings truly have the amazing ability to attune their life-pattern and begin to restore their body, mind, and heart to the natural state of health. "}
