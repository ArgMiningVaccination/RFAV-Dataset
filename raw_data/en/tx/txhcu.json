Treatment of early BC almost always includes surgery. In breast conserving therapy the tumor is removed with a margin of healthy breast tissue and lym ph nodes in the axilla are staged by the sentinel node procedure. If complete removal of the brea st is necessary or preferred by the patient a mastectomy is performed. In case a tumor is found in the sentinel node procedure a complementary lymph node dissection follows . Radiotherapy is part of the standard treatment of breast conserving therapy. Depending on the tumor characteristics an d potential axillary metastases, adjuvant treatment will be prescribed. This adjuvant trea tment generally consists of (a combination of) chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherap y and radiotherapy. Lately, chemotherapy and hormone therapy are also used in a neo-adju vant setting, before surgery. Neo-adjuvant treatment can reduce the size of the tumor, wh ich makes breast conserving therapy possible in some cases or a locally advanced tumor suitable for resection and by administering the systemic therapy before surgery tumor response can be measured. The prognosis of women with BC has improv ed mainly due to better treatment and earlier detection of the malignancy [1-5]. As a consequence, BC has become in most cases a chronic although still life threaten ing disease, thereby increasing the group of survivors. For these women, it has become increasingly impo rtant to focus not only on their medical and physical condition, but also on other outcomes, such as quality of life (QOL), health status (HS), depressive symptoms, state anxiety, fatigu e, and health care utilization. Except health care utilization, the other mentioned outcomes are often summed under the header patient- reported outcomes. The aim of this thesis was to explore whether different types of anxiety play a role in patient-reported outcomes and health care utilization of BC patients after diagnosis. In the next section the predictors, i. e., three types of anxiety, will be discussed. Subsequently, the outcome measures of this thesis will be described. Finally, the methodological aspects of the study will be presented. Predictors The three types of anxiety that we examined as predictors of QOL, HS, depressive symptoms, state anxiety, fatigue, and health care utilization are trait anxiety, anxiety disorders, and state anxiety combined with depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety refers to individual difference s in anxiety proneness, a relatively stable personality disposition which is not influenced by situational stress [6]. The prevalence of a high score on trait anxiety was 47.3% in women with BC, and 46.8% in women with a benign breast problem [7]. Two of the few studies on the role of trait anxiety in BC patients measured the impact of trait anxiety on di stress [8] and fatigue [9]. The review in chapter 2 examined the relationship between trait an xiety and psychological, physical, and/or behavioural outcomes in patients with BC. | 9 Anxiety disorders are experienced by many women at some point in their lives. 'Anxiety disorders' is an umbrella term for multiple disorders. The ICD-10, the International Classification of Diseases of the World Health Organization, contains the 'anxiety disorders' agoraphobia, social phobia, specific (isolate d) phobias, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, acute stress reaction, posttraumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorders, dissociative (conversion) disorders, somatoform disorders, and other neurotic disorders. In this study, a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder is made according to the criteria of the ICD-10, and restricted to agoraphobia, social phobia, panic disorder , and generalized anxiety disorder. In the Netherlands, about 23% of the women aged 18 to 64 years had an anxiety disorder during their life [10]. Consequently, there is a cons iderable group of women with BC that has experienced a period of clinical anxiety in their lives. A recent meta-analysis [11] showed that the point prevalence of anxiety disorders in ca ncer patients is 10.3% and a study by Teesson et al. [12] showed that the 12 months prevalen ce of anxiety disorders in cancer patients was 22.5%. State anxiety, or momentary anxiety, is the level of anxiety a person experiences at a specific moment [13]. BC patients tend to experience elevated levels of state anxiety following diagnosis, throughout the course of treatment, and thereafter [14]. A review by Massie et al. [15] showed that the prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with BC could be up to 46%. Subsequently, an increased state anxiety level is often accompanied by an elevated level of depressive symptoms. A re cent study concluded that there is a strong correlation between depressive symptoms and state anxiety, and that state anxiety was a predictor for elevated depressive symptoms [16]. Associations In two chapters of this thesis we examin ed the associations between a predictor and personality. Chapter 5 looked at the relationship between a history of an anxiety disorder and scores on trait anxiety, neuroticism, and ty pe D personality, whic h is the tendency to experience both high negative affect and social inhibition [17]. Chapter 6 examined the role of combined state anxiety and depressive sy mptoms in trait anxiety and neuroticism. Outcome measures Various outcomes relevant for BC patients we re examined in this thesis. An important outcome in contemporary research is QOL. Th e World Health Organization defined QOL as \"an individual's perception of his/her p osition in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which he/she lives and in relation to his/her goals, expectations, standards and concerns\" [18]. Researchers and medical professionals become increasingly aware of the importance of QOL in research in patients and populations. QOL is a subjective measure that gives an indication of how a person feels concerning relevant domains of his/her life, for example psychological health, social relationships, and environment. There are multiple 10 | questionnaires to measure QOL, one of them is the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument - 100 items [WHOQOL-100; 19]. The abbreviated version of the WHOQOL-100 is the WHOQOL-BREF [20]. The validation of th e WHOQOL-BREF in pati ents with breast problems is described in chapter 3 . Subsequently, two studies in this thesis incorporated QOL as an outcome measure. In chapter 5 , a study is described that examined whether a clinical anxiety disorder earlier in life, i.e., before the diagnosis BC, had a role in the course of QOL up to two years after surgery. In chapter 6 the relationship between combined state anxiety and depressive symptoms and QOL is described. Another outcome in research on patients is HS. Sometimes, QOL, health-related QOL (HRQOL), and HS are used interchangeably, but there is a distinct difference between these concepts [21]. The most important difference is that HS is an indicator for limitations and QOL also adds the extent to which a patient is ha mpered by those limitations in daily life [22]. Concerning HS, just as in QOL, the awareness of the importance for patients and populations is increasing. Nowadays, a simple PubMed search on HS gives almost 9,000 hits, indicating the huge amount of research done on this topic. Earlier research revealed that trait anxiety correlated negatively with HS in BC patients [23]. It also predicted higher levels of distress [8], which is related to worse HS [24]. In chapter 4 a study is described that examined the effect of trait anxiety on HS in women with BC. The studies in chapter 5 & 6 had, next to QOL, also state anxiety, and depressive symptoms as outcome measures. Fatigue is a symptom that numerous BC patients report. It can be a disease characteristic, and/or an effect of the disease treatment. Many patients experience fatigue as very debilitating and restrictive for daily life [ 25]. Fatigue is also a symptom that can be very persistent [26]. About 20% of the BC patients report fatigue five years post-treatment [27]. We know from earlier research that trait anxiet y is one of the predictors of fatigue in the years after BC diagnosis [9, 28]. Health care utilization was an outcome measure in chapter 5 . The aim of this study was to examine whether there was a difference between patients with and without a history of an anxiety disorder in health care utilizatio n, operationalized as the number of contacts with the general practitioner, being admitted to the hospital or not, and having had an appointment with a specialist or not in the two years after initial treatment. There is limited research on health care utilization in BC pa tients [29-32], and none of these studies had examined the relationship between trait anxiety and health care utilization. Outline of the study The studies in this thesis are conducted in cooperation with six Dutch hospitals. Women referred by the national screening program or their general practitioner to the outpatient clinic of the St Elisabeth hospital in Tilburg (2002 - 2010), the Maasland hospital in Sittard (2004 - 2006), the Jeroen Bosch hospital in Den Bosch (2006 - 2009), VieCuri medical center | 11 in Venlo (2008 - 2010), medical center Alkmaar (2008 - 2011), or the Catharina hospital in Eindhoven (2007 - 2011) in the Netherlands, were asked to participate in this study. A specialized mamma-care nurse informed th e patients about the study during their first appointment. When women agreed to pa rticipate in the study, they completed an informed consent and a set of questionnaires (Time0). Women were not yet informed about the diagnosis of their breast problem at the time they completed the first set of questionnaires. All participants subsequently re ceived questionnaires at one (Time1), three (Time2), six (Time3), 12 (Time4), and 24 months (Time5) after surgical treatment (BC patients) or diagnosis (benign breast problem group). Fo r the BC patients the surgical treatment was the reference date to avoid the probability th at the Time1 questionnaire would be delivered about the time of surgery, which would make it more difficult for patients to participate. The time points were chosen according to the possible adjuvant treatment schedule. In addition, a diagnostic interview was administered at Time 4 to assess lifetime clinical anxiety and depressive disorders. This interview was admini stered at Time4 and not at Time0, because at Time0 it would be a too large burden for pati ents at that particular moment. Another advantage was that we had information on di sorders that developed or persisted after diagnosis, and the disorders that emerged before diagnosis were administered nevertheless. Exclusion criteria for this study were a me dical history with breast disease and not being able to complete Dutch questionnaires fo r linguistic, cognitive or psychiatric reasons. The study is approved by the Dutch Medical Ethical Committee (ccMo NL15659.008.06) and registered at the Dutch Trial Register (NTR1555). Measures All participants were asked to complete questio nnaires, which they received by mail or email. An overview of the questionnaires and measure moments is given in Table 1. TABLE 1.

The WHOQOL-100 covers six domains: Physical, Psychological, Level of in dependence, Social relationships, Environment, and Spirituality. Ther e are 24 facets within the domains and there is one Overall QOL and General health facet . The time frame of reference is the previous 2 weeks. The instrument is reliable and valid [34] and the sensit ivity of the instrument is also high [35]. The WHOQOL-BREF, the 26-item versio n of the WHOQOL-100 [19], was administered in a part of the patient population. The WHOQOL-BREF cons ists of four domains (Physical health, Psychological health, Social relationships, and Environment) and two items concerning Overall QOL and General health. The re liability and validity are reported to be good [20], and sensitivity to change was found to be high in patient with a liver transplantation, except for the Social relationships domain [34]. HS was measured with the va lidated 23-item disease-specific European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Breast Cancer module (EORTC QLQ-BR23) [36, 37]. It measures the functi onal scales Body image, Sexual functioning, Sexual enjoyment, and Future perspective and the disease symptom scales Systemic therapy side-effects, Breast symptoms, Arm sy mptoms, and Upset by hair loss. The presence and degree of depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES -D) [38]. This is a 20-item self-report scale. The CES-D has been established as a valid and reliable measure of depressive symptoms in BC patients [39]. Reliability and criterion validity are good [40, 41]. In this study also the 16-item version [42] was used, which consists of negative formulated items only. It was found to be a valid assessment of depressive symptoms in cancer patients [42]. The 10-item Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) [4 3] was used to measure fatigue. This is a 10-item scale with good reli ability and validity in women with breast problems [44]. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure state anxiety, i.e., the level of momentary anxiety. Both the original 20-item version [45, 46] as well as the 6-item short version were used [47]. Both versions ha ve shown to have good validity and reliability [47-49]. Trait anxiety, i.e., the personality trait that reflects the disposition to experience anxiety in threatening situations, was also meas ured with the STAI [13, 50]. Both the 20-item and the 10-item version were used in this study. Psychometric properties of the 20-item version [13] and the 10-item version [51] are good. The personality trait neuroticism was measured by the neuroticism part (12 items) of the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness-Five Fa ctor Inventory (NEO-FFI) [52, 53]. The reliability and validity of this questio nnaire are acceptable to good [52]. Type D personality, i.e., the tendency to experience both high negative affect and social inhibition, was measured with the 14-item Type D Personality Scale (DS14) [17]. Validity and reliability of the DS14 are good [17, 54]. Lifetime anxiety disorders (Panic disord er, Generalized anxiety disorder, Social phobia, and Agoraphobia) were assessed with the World Health Organization Composite | 13 International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) [55]. Th is is a structured clinical interview of which the anxiety part was used in this study. Reliab ility of the CIDI is good to excellent, and the validity is demonstrated to be good [56]. Demographics Demographic data were assessed by self-repor t questions concerning age, marital status, having children, education level, and work status. Health care utilization Health care utilization (medical specialists, hosp ital stay, general practitioner, psychosocial health care, cancer program, physical therapist, dietician, and alternative therapist) in the two years after initial treatment was measured by self-report questions. All contacts were measured as yes or no. Only fo r GP visits also the number of contacts was registered. Medical Information Information on disease stage at diagnosis [57] , type of operation, and adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy ) was retrieved from patients' medical files in cooperation with the Comprehensive Cancer Center South. 14 | References 1.

Chapter 2 Trait anxiety in breast cancer patients: a systematic review Van Esch L, Van Eekelen F, Roukema JA, De Vries J. Trait anxiety in breast cancer patients: a systematic review. Submitted for publication 18 | Abstract Objective The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between trait anxiety, i.e., the disposition to respond to stressful situations with a rise in anxiety intensity, and psychological, physical, and/or be havioural outcomes in patients with breast cancer (BC). Methods A systematic literature search identified 39 eligible studies on trait anxiety in BC patients. Studies were only eligible if the st udy population concerned BC patients and trait anxiety was an independent variable in the an alyses. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed by two researchers using a 17-item predefined checklist. Results The majority of the reviewed articles had several methodological limitations. The reviewed studies showed that trait anxiety play ed a role in psychological outcomes, multiple physical outcomes, namely fatigu e, nausea, expected post-surgical pain, arm and shoulder limitations after surgery, patients' ratings of cosmetic outcome at the en d of treatment, sensitivity to Tamoxifen-induced symptoms, the tendency to attr ibute symptoms to Tamoxifen use, lumbar spine bone mineral density, sex hormone-binding globulin, the amount of different lymphocytes, and immunos uppression. Trait anxiety was also related to sleep difficulty, complementary a nd alternative medicine use, and breast self examination. Conclusion Although the reviewed articles had several methodological limitations and the methodology of research on trait anxiety in BC patients should be improved, trait anxiety is involved in various psychological, physical, an d behavioral facets of BC. There is strong evidence that BC patients high on trait anxiet y are at increased risk to experience adverse psychological, physical, and behavioral effects. Therefore, we should screen BC patients on trait anxiety. | 19 Introduction Nowadays, breast cancer (BC) affects about one in eight or nine women from Western countries [1, 2]. Death rates decreased in the la st years [1, 3, 4], which makes BC a chronic instead of a life threatening disease, thereby increasing the group of survivors. Receiving a BC diagnosis and treatment is ve ry stressful and can result in developing mood disorders [5, 6]. In studies on adjust ment to BC, about 20 to 30% of the women suffered from high levels of distress in the firs t year after diagnosis [7]. A literature review of Husson et al. [8] showed that the diagnosis of cancer provokes depression and anxiety. Another study reported on factors that are asso ciated with an increased risk for developing psychosocial problems [9]. One of the factors that can influence psychological and physical outcomes in cancer patients is personality. There are studies that ex amined the role of pers onality traits such as neuroticism optimism [10, 13, 14], and trait anxiety [15, 16] in BC patients. Outcomes in these studies were, e.g., quality of life (QOL), distress, work ability, health status (HS), and emotional well-being. Up to date, there are no reviews that summa rize the role that trait anxiety has on disease outcomes in BC patients. Trait anxiety refers to individual differences in anxiety proneness; a relatively stable personality disp osition which is not influenced by situational stress [17]. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the relationship between trait anxiety and psychological, physical, and/or be havioural outcomes in patients with BC. Methods and patients Search strategy To identify studies reporting trait anxiety in BC patients, the search strategy combined the terms ' breast cancer ' or a synonym (\"mamma / mammae / mammar* / breast* AND cancer / cancers / carcinoma / carcinomas / carcinom a* / carcinog* / tumor / tumors / tumors / tumour / tumours / tumours / neoplasm neoplast* / malignan*) and 'trait anxiety' (or personality AND anxious / anxiety). The search was conducted in the databases PubMed (245 hits), Embase (24 hits), Cochrane Library (36 hits), and PsychINFO (182 hits). To find other relevant publications, which were not identified by computerized search , the references of all included studies were checked. Selection criteria Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (a) trait anxiety was an independent variable in the analyses, i.e., trait anxiety was not an outcome measure (b) the study population concerned BC patients, and (c) a pe er-reviewed full report article published in English or Dutch. Articles were not included if tr ait anxiety was approached as state anxiety, if the objective was to study predictors of the deve lopment of BC in the population, and if it was a review or a case-report. All criteria were ap plied to the 533 hits. After (full text) screening 20 | the records, 39 articles met the criteria (Figur e 1). Reasons for excluding the 30 articles after full text screening were that in 12 studies trait anxiety was not an independent variable in the analyses, in nine studies anxiety that was measured was not trait anxiety, two studies examined whether trait anxiety was a predicto r of the development of BC, and one article described the outline of a study, and not yet the results of the study. Articles were also excluded when there were multiple reports on the same patient sample and outcome measure. Only one article was included based on the highest quality score and if studies were of equal quality, only the most recent study wa s included. If the studies described different outcome measures, they were incl uded. Six articles were excluded based on this criterion. All the included studies have a publication date between 1981 and 2011. Quality assessment The methodological quality of the selected 39 ar ticles reviewed by two researchers (FVE and LVE), using a 17-item predefined checklist (T able 1). This checklist was based on an established criteria list for systematic reviews [1 8-20]. A study could be assigned one point for each item in the checklist. When there was an insufficient or no description of the item, the item was scored zero. When there occurred disa greement about the quality of studies, it was solved through discussion in a consensus meeting. Fig. 1 Flowchart of the inclusion of articles in the review N = 418 records screened Search PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, and Cochrane: N = 533 Double hits: N = 115 N = 349 excluded based on criteria N = 69 full text screened N = 39 studies included N = 30 excluded based on criteria | 21 TABLE 1. Criteria list for assessing the methodological quality of studies on trait anxiety Positive if with regard to Study population A Patient signed an informed consent form before study participation B A description is present of a least two sociod emographic data (e.g. age, race, employment status, educational status, etc.) C Medical data is described (e.g. tumor stage at diagnosis, treatment, etc.) D Inclusion and/or exclusion criteria are formulated E Participation and response rates for pati ent groups have to be more than 75% F Information is presented about patient/disease characteristics of nonresponders Study design G Sample size is at least consisting of 50 patients (arbitrarily chosen) H At least two statistical procedures are used and described (e.g. t-test, chi-square test, ANOVAs, correlations, regression analysis) I The data collection is described (e.g. self-report measurements, interview) J Standardized or valid self-report measurements to assess trait anxiety are used K Definition of (trait) anxiety is described L An outcome of breast cancer, in which trait anxiet y plays a role, is described (e.g. quality of life, psychological distress, adjuvant th erapy, fatigue, social support) M There are multiple assessment points in time N The collection of data is prospectively gathered O Dropout rate 20% Results P The results of trait anxiety are compared betwee n two groups or more (e.g. healthy population, different treatment groups, etc.) Q Mean, median, standard deviations or percentages are reported for trait anxiety Results Study characteristics The 39 studies that met our selection criteria are summarized in Tables 3, 4, and 5, divided in Psychological, Physical, and Behavioral outcomes, respectively. The sample size ranged from 48 [21, 22] to 3343 [23] patients. A longitudina l follow-up design was used in 19 studies, 15 used a cross-sectional design, two studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) [24, 25], two studies were prospective with a short follow-up period [15, 26], and one retrospective [27]. Different comparison groups were included, e.g. healthy controls, patients with a benign diagnosis, patients with another BC treatment, or patients with another level of trait anxiety. There was no comparison group in 25 studies. Different self-report questionnaires were used to assess trait anxiety, of which the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was the most frequently used, namely in 27 studies. Methodological quality The quality scores ranged from 7 to 15, with a mean quality score of 11.2 (Table 2). General shortcomings of the included articles concerne d the following items: 17 out of 39 studies did not have multiple assessment points in time, 27 studies did not describe a definition of trait anxiety, and 19 studies did not provide patient- or disease characteristics of non-responders. 22 | Psychological Outcomes Table 3 shows the studies with psychological outcomes. To indicate the role of trait anxiety in QOL, four longitudinal studies [5, 22, 28, 29] and three cross-sectional studies [30-32] have been performed. All seven studies showed that higher trait anxiety was correlated with or predicted worse QOL. Trait anxiety appeared to be a stronger predictor for QOL than some clinical factors, such as type of surgery (bre ast conserving surgery or mastectomy) [29]. Den Oudsten focused on the relationship of trait anxi ety and quality of sexual life in BC patients in one study [28] and on perceived availability of social support and satisfaction with social support in another study [5]. In the first stud y women with high trait anxiety appeared to have worse quality of sexual life, sexual function ing, and sexual enjoymen t at six months after BC surgery than women not high on trait anxiety. In the study on social support trait anxiety was negatively associated with perceived availa bility of social support at 12 and 24 months after diagnosis. State anxiety was an outcome measure in se ven studies [32-38], of which two were longitudinal [36, 37]. Regarding the relationsh ip between trait anxiety and state anxiety, contradictory findings were reported. One study found that higher trait anxiety was associated with higher state anxiety and cancer-specific anxiety [35], but in another study trait anxiety was not a predictor for state anxiety scores [32]. Trait anxiety also had a positive association with multiple anxiety-related aspects, i.e., needle-anxiety [33], fear of recurrence [34], enhanced worry about illness [36], and an ticipatory anxiety before and after cancer treatment [37].

In all three st udies trait anxiety was significantly related to depressive symptoms. One study compared BC and BBP patients [54] and in both groups trait anxiety predicted depressive symptoms. Psychological distress was evaluated in seven studies [7, 15, 32, 38, 40, 49, 55]. The Profile of Mood States questionnaire was used to measure psychological distress in three of these studies [15, 49, 55]. The conclusion of two longitudinal studies and one prospective study was that patients with an anxious persona lity were at risk for psychological distress [7, 15, 40]. Also, the three cross-sectional studies [32, 49, 55] showed that trait anxiety was related to (components of) psychological distress , although in one study only in univariate analyses, not in multivariate analysis [49]. 24 | In a longitudinal study on the relationship between trait anxiety and health status [16] the authors reported on the significant relationship between trait anxiety and four domains of health status, namely future perspe ctive, sexual functioning, systemic therapy side-effects, and body image. However, anothe r body-image related cross-sectional study by Spyropoulou [43] showed that trait anxiety scores were not related to phantom breast syndrome, i.e., the sensation of the continued presence of the breast after its removal by mastectomy. Physical outcomes The studies which included physical outcomes are listed in Table 4. Four longitudinal studies [41, 44, 52, 54] and one cross-sectional study [46] examined the relationship between trait anxiety and fatigue in BC patients. Fatigue was me asured with five different instruments. In all studies higher trait anxiety was related to or a predictor of more fatigue [41, 44, 52, 54] or expected fatigue [46]. This relation was also found in patients with a benign breast problem [54]. Different treatment side-effects were examin ed in four longitudinal studies [36, 41, 42, 48], two cross-sectional studies [30, 46], one RCT [25], and one retrospective study [27]. Concerning trait anxiety and nausea and vomiting, results were contradictory [25, 41, 42, 48]. Trait anxiety was a predictor for expected post-surgical pain [46] and was subsequently associated with more arm and shoulder symptoms and limitations after surgery [30]. In a study by Deshields [27] trait anxiety was an indirect predicto r of patients' ratings of cosmetic outcome at the end of treatment. Furthermore, trait anxiety was associated with heightened sensitivity to Tamoxifen-induced symptoms and the tendency to attribute symptoms to Tamoxifen use, but not to symptoms unrelated to Tamoxifen use [36]. Two RCT's [24, 25], two longitudinal studies [21, 39], one prospective study [26], and one cross-sectional study [51] examined the relationship between trait anxiety and different biomarkers. Trait anxiety level was not related to the stress biomarker Chromogranin A [39], and to mean cortisol levels and intercept (morning) values of cortisol, but high-anxious patients did have a flatter diurnal slope than not-high-anxious patients [51]. In patients scoring high on trait anxiety Tamoxifen produced greater preservation of lumbar spine bone mineral density and suppressed Tamoxifen-induced increases in sex hormone-binding globulin [24]. Studies on immunological status reported opposite results. One study showed that anxious preoccupation was negatively correlated with number of lymphocytes, B- lymphocytes, total lymphocytes, and T4 lymphocytes [26], but another study concluded that trait anxiety was not associated with lymphokine-a ctivated and natural killer cell activity in BC patients [21]. In research done by Fredrikson [25] high trait anxiety was associated with conditioned nausea and vomiting, and patients with conditioned nausea and vomiting had a lower number of monocytes, indicating that im munosuppression has occurred. This study also revealed that persons high on trait anxiety had less helper/inducer T-cells, again resulting in | 25 lower effectiveness of the immune system. So, patients high on trait anxiety exposed to a stressor (chemotherapy) were more vulnerable to immune change. There was one study that loo ked at the relation between trait anxiety and survival after initial treatment [53] and concluded that trait anxiety was not related to the risk of death ten years after diagnosi s in women with BC. Behavioral Outcomes The studies with behavioral outcomes are listed in Table 5. Three cross-sectional studies [23, 47, 50] and one longitudinal study [36] were do ne on behavioral outcome measures. Colagiuri [23] showed that sleep difficulty was predicte d by seven significant predictors, among which high levels of anxiety in a large cross-sectiona l study. Higher trait anxiety was also associated with Complementary and Alternative Medicine use related to one's cancer diagnosis [50]. Another study [36] found that high trait anxiet y and Tamoxifen use were associated with an increase in breast self examination, compared with high trait anxiety and no Tamoxifen use. Finally, Pruyn [47] examined the adoption of the Moerman diet in BC and Hodgkin patients. There was no relation between trait anxiety a nd adoption of the diet in BC patients. TABLE 3.

In total, 39 articles were included. Almost all studies showed that trait anxiet y played a role in psychological outcomes, except two low quality studies and a study into phantom breast syndrome. Moreover, many studies on physical outcomes reported signific ant relationships between trait anxiety and the outcome measure, i.e., fatigue [41, 44, 46, 52, 54], nausea [25, 41, 42], expected post-surgical pain [46], arm and shoulder limitations after surgery [30] , and the prediction of patients' ratings of cosmetic outcome at the end of t reatment [27]. Furthermore, trait anxiety was associated with heightened sensitivity to Ta moxifen-induced symptoms and the tendency to attribute symptoms to Tamoxifen use, but not to symptoms unrelated to Tamoxifen use [36]. In studies with biomarkers the results were inco nclusive. Trait anxiety level was not related to the stress biomarker Chromogranin A [39], cortis ol levels [51], and lymphokine-activated and natural killer cell activity [21]. It was, however, related to lumbar spin e bone mineral density and sex hormone-binding globulin [24], the amount of different lymphocytes [26], and immunosuppression, which implies that patien ts high on trait anxiety may develop an increased susceptibility to pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Trait anxiety was not related to the risk of deat h ten years after diagnosis in women with BC [53]. In the studies with behavioral outcomes tr ait anxiety was related to sleep difficulty [23], complementary and alternative medicine us e [50], and breast self examination [36], but not to adoption of the Moerman diet [47]. The reviewed articles had several methodological limitations which made it more difficult to draw powerful conclusions abou t the relation between trait anxiety and the different outcomes in patients with BC. Impr ovement in the methodology of research is therefore possible and desirable. To increase the impact and relevance of research there should be attention for the study desi gn; a longitudinal design is preferred. Furthermore, the sample size of most studies was rather small, especially given the fact that in most studies samples are divided in two or more groups. In future studies it is therefore important to include sufficient patients. In most studies, validated questionnaires were used, both for assessing trait anxiety and for outcome measures. There were, however, various different measures and questionnaires that assessed trait anxiety and especially the outcome measures, e.g. the construct psychological di stress, which makes it hard to compare the results of the different studies. Of the 39 review ed articles, 25 lacked a control or comparison group. In future research the inclusion of contro l, waiting list, or comparison groups should be part of the study design. Finally, it was not always clear whether the anxiety measured was trait anxiety or state anxiety. State anxiety is a transitory emotional state that varies in intensity and fluctuates over time. Trait anxi ety, on the other hand, refers to a stable susceptibility or proneness to experience stat e anxiety frequently [56]. Quality and clarity | 33 could be gained when researchers define the type of anxiety they measure. In this review, only 12 out of 39 articles described a definition of trait anxiety. Furthermore, there was only one study that examined the relationship between trait anxiety and survival in BC patients, and th ere were no studies that had recurrence or metastasizing of BC as an outcome measure. This is a serious caveat in personality research in BC patients and should deserve more attention. Overall, there seems to be a lack in method ological and qualitative good research on the role that trait anxiety plays in psychologi cal, physical, and behavioral outcomes in BC patients. Future studies should include su fficient patients, control groups, and use a longitudinal design, preferably with a follow-up durat ion of at least two years. In that way, it will be possible to draw founded and legitimate conclusions on the relationship between trait anxiety and different outcomes in BC patients. In conclusion, trait anxiety is involved in various psychological, physical, and behavioral facets of BC. There is strong evidence that BC patients with high trait anxiety have a lower QOL, more anxiety and depressive symp toms, experience more psychological distress and fatigue, and can have a variation in biomarke r levels compared with BC patients not high on trait anxiety. Thus, patients high on trai t anxiety are at increased risk to experience adverse psychological, physical, and behavioral effects. Therefore, we should screen BC patients on trait anxiety. This ca n be easily done with the STAI or even the short version of the STAI. Then it becomes possible to offer tailored psychologica l care to BC patients, thereby preventing women who score high on trait anxiety to develop all sorts of psychological, physical, behavioral complaints. 34 | References 1.

Chapter 3 The WHOQOL-BREF quality of life assessment in women with breast problems Van Esch L, Den Oudsten BL, De Vries J (2011). The WHOQOL-BREF quality of life assessment in women with breast problems. International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology , 11, 5-22. 38 | Abstract Objective The aim was to compare the psychometr ic properties between World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument, shor t form (WHOQOL-BREF) data derived from the WHOQOL-100 and data directly from the WHOQOL-BREF and to assess additional psychometric properties of the WHOQOL- BREF in women with breast problems. Methods One group (SG1; N = 607) completed the WHOQOL-100 four times, another group (SG2; N = 549) completed the WHOQOL-BREF once . The groups consisted of women with a palpable lump in the breast or an abnormalit y on a screening mammography. All participants completed measures of anxiety (STAI), depres sive symptoms (CES-D), and fatigue (FAS). Women with breast cancer completed a he alth status measure (EORTC QLQ-BR23). Results Confirmatory analyses of the WHOQOL-BREF-data of both groups showed a reasonably good fit (CFI = .88; Cronbach's alphas of the domains exceeded .70 in both groups, except for Social relationships ( = .67/.68). Convergent validity was shown by the moderate ( r = .30 - .49) to high ( r > .49) correlations between scores on the FAS, STAI-State, EORTC QLQ-BR23 and the WHOQOL-BREF domains Physical and Psychological health . Good test-retest reliability ( r's > .70) was found. Conclusion WHOQOL-BREF-data derived from the WHOQOL-100 or obtained from the WHOQOL-BREF directly are comparable, an d the WHOQOL-BREF has good psychometric properties in women with breast problems. | 39 Introduction Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy in women in Europe [1]. Nowadays, one in every eight women in the Netherlands will receive the diagnosis of BC in her life [2]. In general, women with a lump or pain in their nipp le or breast or an abnormality on a screening mammography are referred to an outpatient clin ic or hospital to get a thorough examination of a mammography, ultrasound and/or biopsy. Afterwards women receive a diagnosis of either BC or a benign breast problem (BBP). The prognosis of women with BC has improved due to, for instance, better treatment and earlier detection. As a consequence, the number of BC survivors has increased [1, 3-6]. Furthermor e, there are even more women that receive a diagnosis of BBP [4, 7]. These women were also in the distressing phase of waiting for a diagnose [8] and might even have heightened le vels of stress afterwards even though they received a benign diagnosis [9]. Therefore, it has become increasingly important to focus on patient-centred outcomes [10-12], such as quality of life (QOL). There is still debate on how to conceptualize QOL, illustrated by the amount of literature concerning QOL in which there are major differences in the definition of the concept [13]. Nevertheless, there are some communalities in the definitions of QOL, name ly multidimensionality, which re fers to QOL comprising of at least the psychological, physical and social face ts of life, and subjectivity, which means that QOL is evaluated from the perspective of the individual. One of the instruments that is regularly us ed to measure QOL, is the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument - 100 items [WHOQOL-100; 14], a cross-culturally developed generic instrument. It was created by the World Health Organization Quality of Life Group (WHOQOL Group), that defined QOL as \"an individual's perception of his/her position in life in the context of the culture and value sy stems in which he/she lives and in relation to his/her goals, expectations, standards and concerns\" [15]. Following the development of the WHOQOL -100, the WHOQOL Group developed an abbreviated form of the WHOQOL-100, th e WHOQOL-BREF [16]. The WHOQOL-BREF has been proposed as an alternat ive instrument to measure QOL, since the WHOQOL-100 may be too lengthy for some users, for instance, where burden of the participants should be minimized. In addition, it has been shown that response rates tend to be higher when short measures are employed [16]. The WHOQOL-BREF contains 26 items; one item from each of the 24 facets contained in the original WHOQ OL-100 and two items were retrieved from the 'Overall QOL and General health' facet . The WHOQOL-BREF covers four domains: Physical health, Psychological health, Social relationships, and Environment. The WHOQOL-100 has been validated in different patient groups, for example, women with BC [17], in sarcoma patients [18] and in psychiatric outpatients [19]. Also the WHOQOL-BREF was previously valid ated in multiple countries and languages [20, 21], and different patient groups, such as patients with HIV/ AIDS [22], spinal cord injury [23], sickle cell disease [24], postnatal women [25], and adult psychiatric outpatients [26], but never in women with breast problems. 40 | Therefore, the aim of the present instrumental study [27, 28] in women with breast problems was twofold. First, to compare th e psychometric properties of WHOQOL-BREF scores obtained by deriving them from scores on the WHOQOL-100 (Study group 1 - SG1) with the WHOQOL-BREF scores obtained by completing the WHOQOL-B REF directly (Study group 2 - SG2). Second, to examine additional conver gent validity and test-retest reliability, and obtain an indication of the sensitivity to chan ge of the WHOQOL-BREF for use in women with breast problems. With regard to the first aim, we hypothesiz ed that reliability and validity for the two methods of obtaining scores on the WHOQOL-BREF would be good and comparable between SG1 and SG2. We also expected the earlier me ntioned four-domain model [16] to fit well in women with breast problems, in SG1 and SG2. Furthermore, based on previous studies [29- 32], our expectation was that the internal consistency would be good for the domains of the WHOQOL- BREF, with a Cronbach's alpha exceeding .70. We expected the construct validity to be good. To explore the convergent and divergent validity we correlated scores on th e WHOQOL-BREF with measures of anxiety, depression, and fatigue since these symptoms are common in women with breast problems [11]. We expected that Pearson's correlation co efficients would be moderate ( r = .30 - .49) to high ( r > .49) between specific domains of the WHOQOL-BREF and the related questionnaires, for example, between the Psychological health domain and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) [33]. Low correlations ( r = .10 - .29) were expected between WHOQOL-BREF domains and non-related questionnaires, for example, between the Social relationships domain and the State-Trait Anxiety Invent ory - State scale (STAI-State; [34]). Regarding th e second aim, the hypothesis was that Pearson's correlation coefficients would be moderate to high between the Physical health domain and the Symptom scales of the European Organization for Research and Trea tment of Cancer BC-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire [35]) in SG1, expressing good convergent validity [17]. Based on the results of previous research, te st-retest reliability of the WHOQOL-BREF was expected to be good in SG1 [20, 36]. We expect ed the WHOQOL-BREF to gi ve an indication of good sensitivity to change in the BC group. Method Participants SG1 consisted of women visiting the department of surgery of the St. Elisabeth hospital (Tilburg), Jeroen Bosch hospital (Den Bosch), or Maasland hospital (Sittard) in The Netherlands for the first time with a palpable lump in the breast or an abnormality on screening mammography between September 2 002 and September 2006. SG1 consisted of 607 women. Of this group, 225 women later re ceived the diagnosis BC (BC group) and 382 women had a benign breast problem (BBP group). SG2 consisted of women visiting the depa rtment of surgery of the St. Elisabeth hospital (Tilburg), Jeroen Bosch hospital (Den Bosch), VieCuri medical 41 center Alkmaar (Alkmaar), or Catharina hospital (Eindhoven) in The Netherlands for the first time with a palpable lump in the breast or an abnormality on screening mammography between June 2007 and August 2009. SG2 consisted of 549 women, of whom 121 women later received the diagnosis BC and 428 had a BBP. The exclusion criteria in both studies were recurrence of disease at baseline, poor expression in the Dutch language, dementia, an d a history of psychiatric illness. Women with a history of psychiatric illness were excluded to obtain the QOL in formation about women with breast problems without int erference of psychiatric illness, which is related to a range of psychosocial problems and a decreased QOL [37] . The studies were approved by the medical ethics committee, and patients were only included after giving informed consent. The inclusion of patients in both studies occurred before diagnosis was known. Measures The WHOQOL-100, Dutch version [38] was used in SG1. The structure of the WHOQOL-100 covers six domains: Physical, Psychological, Level of in dependence, Social relationships, Environment, and Spirituality. With in the domains there are 24 facets and there is one Overall QOL and General health facet . Each facet is assessed by four items, which score on a five- point Likert scale, ranging from 1 ( not at all/never/very dissatisfied/very poor ) to 5 (extremely/always/very satisfied/very good ). The time frame of the items is the previous two weeks. High facet scores indicate good QOL; except for the facets Pain and discomfort, Negative feelings, and Dependence on medic ation or treatments, which are negatively framed. The instrument is reliable and valid [39] and the sensitivity of the instrument is also high [40]. SG2 completed the WHOQOL-BREF, the sh ort form of the WHOQOL-100 [14]. The WHOQOL-BREF consists of four domains (Phy sical health, Psycholo gical health, Social relationships, and Environment) and two items concerning Overall QOL and General health . These two items are not included in the calculat ion of domain scores. The response scales, all five-point Likert type ranging from 1 ( not at poor ) to 5 (extremely/always/very satisfied/very good ), and the time frame, i.e., the previous two weeks, are similar as in the WHOQOL-100. Higher scores indicate a better subjective QOL. Reliability and validity are reported to be good [16], and sensitivity to change was found to be high in patient with a liver transplantation, ex cept for the Social relationships domain [39]. The CES-D [41] is a 20-item self-report scale measuring the presence and degree of depressive symptoms over the past week. The CES-D has been established as a valid and reliable measure of depressive symptoms in BC patients [42]. Reliability and criterion validity are good [43, 44]. The rating scale ranges from 0 ( seldom or never ) to 3 ( (almost) always ). Scores can range from 0 to 60. State anxiety was measured by the STAI-State . State anxiety is defined as anxiety at the present moment. The version completed by SG1 consists of 20 items [45, 46]. Validity and 42 | reliability of this version appe ar to be good [47]. The version completed by SG2 consists of 6 items [34]. This short form also has shown to have good reliability and validity [34, 48]. The Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS; [49] is a 10-item questionnaire to assess fatigue. The response scale is a 5-point scale from 1 ( never ) to 5 ( always ); scores on the FAS can range from 10 to 50. The reliability and validity of th e FAS appeared to be go od in persons working at least 20 hours per week [49, 50], and sarcoido sis patients [51, 52], 54]. The EORTC QLQ-BR23 [35, 55] is a health status measure containing 23 items. It measures the functional scales Body image, Sexu al functioning, Sexual enjoyment, and Future perspective and the disease symptom scales Syst emic therapy side-effects, Breast symptoms, Arm symptoms, and Upset by hair loss. Answers vary from 1 ( not at all ) to 4 ( very much ). Higher scores on the functional scales represen t a higher level of functioning, while higher scores on the symptom scales represent more symptomatology. Procedure All patients (SG1 and SG2) were asked to repo rt a number of socio-demographic aspects (age, sex, marital status, educational level) and comp leted a questionnaire set before they received a diagnosis (Time0). Patients in SG1 completed the following questionnaires at Time0: WHOQOL-100, CES-D, STAI-State, and Fatigue As sessment Scale (FAS). The WHOQOL-100 was completed again one (Time1), three (Time2) and 12 (Time3) mo nths later. Women with BC additionally completed the disease-specific EORTC QLQ-BR23 at Time3. Patients in SG2 questionnaires at Time 0: WHOQOL-BREF, CES-D, STAI-State, and FAS. Statistical analysis Student t-tests, Chi-square tests, and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to compare the BBP and the BC groups of both SG1 and SG 2 on socio-demographic aspects, scores on state anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, an d QOL. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test the four-domain structure in SG1 and SG2. Goodness of fit was verified by the following fit indices: th e Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). The models have a sa tisfactory to good fit when CFI > .90 and RMSEA < .06 [56]. The internal consistency for each domain was estimated using Cronbach's alpha. Depending on the number of questions in a domain, values should be at least .70 [57]. In order to provide information on construct validity, Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated between the WHOQOL-BREF domains an d the STAI-State, CES-D, FAS at Time0 both SG1 EORTC QLQ- BR23 is a disease-specific questionnaire for BC patients, in this analysis only BC patients were included. Moderate ( r = .30 - .49) and high ( r > .49) correlations are indicative for convergent validity, whereas small correlations ( r = .10 - .29) are indicative for divergent validity [57, 58]. To measure the test-retest reliability of the WHOQOL- Pearson's correlation coefficients of the Overall QOL and Genera l health facet and the WHOQOL-BREF domains | 43 were calculated between Time1 and Time2, Ti me1 and Time3, and Time2 in BBP group of SG1. These correlations were also computed for the BC group of SG1, to get an indication of the sensitivity to change of the WHOQOL-BREF. With a Fisher r-to-z transformation we calculated the significance of the differences between the correlations of the BBP group and the BC group. To compare the predictive value of the do main scores of the WHOQOL-100 and the WHOQOL-BREF on scores on the CES-D, FAS, ST AI-State and EORTC 12 months after baseline, regression analyses (enter method) were perfor med on SG1. Significant different variables between the BC and BBP group were entered in the first block, domain scores in the second block. The data were processed by means of the St atistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 17.0 for Windows), except for the CFA (AMOS 17.0). Results Patient characteristics of SG1 and SG2 are pr esented in Table 1. Extensive descriptive statistics for SG1 and SG2 on the four domain s and Overall QOL and General health of the WHOQOL-BREF are provided in Table 2. Confirmatory factor analysis Careful inspection of the modification indi ces suggested a number of modifications to improve the four-domain models. Without correl ated errors, the model for did not meet our criteria for an acceptable fit in SG1 (CFI = .85; RMSEA = .07) and in SG2 (CFI = .86; RMSEA = .07) (see Figure 1). The model fit for SG1 improv ed significantly (CFI = .88; RMSEA = .06) when three pairs of error variances were allowed to co vary (i.e., item 10 (Phy sical health) and item 11 (Psychological health); Psychological health domain and item 22 (Environment); item 12 (Environment) and item 13 (Environment)). In SG 2 the model fit improved significantly (CFI = .90; RMSEA = .06) when five pairs of error va riances were allowed to covary (i.e., Social relationships domain and Environment domain; Social relationships domain and item 22 (Environment); Environment domain and item 25 (Physical health); Psychological health domain and item 8 (Environment); item 7 (Psy chological health) and Psychological health domain). For the associations between the latent variable QOL and the four domains the following standardized regression weights were obtained in SG1: 1.00 (Physical health), .70 (Psychological health), .77 (Social relationsh ips), and .76 (Environment) and in SG2: .64 (Physical health), 1.11 (Psychological health), . 76 (Social relationships), and .84 (Environment).

Construct validity was also measured in SG1 by correlating the scores at Time4 on the four domains and the Overall QOL and General health facet of the WHOQOL-BREF with the scores at Time4 of the different facets of the EORTC QLQ-BR23 (see Table 5). The Physical health domain of the WHOQOL-BREF were associated moderately ( p < .01) with the symptom scales of the EORTC QLQ-BR23. The Psychological health domain of the WHOQOL-BREF was respectively moderately and highly associated ( p < .01) with the facets Body image and Future perspective of the EORTC QLQ-BR23. Correlations between the Social relationships domain of the WHOQOL-BREF and the facets Sexual functioning and Sexual enjoyment were respectively moderate and low (Table 5). Test-retest reliability and sensitivity to change Pearson's correlations between all time points of the Overall QOL and General health facet and the four domains of the WHOQOL-BREF in pa tients with a BBP were ranging from .73 to .86. In the BC group the correlations ranged fr om .58 to .84, with the lowest correlations between Time1 and Time3. Differences between the correlations of the BBP group and the BC group were significant at Time1-Time 2 and Time1-Time3, except for the Environment domain (Table 6). TABLE 5.

Discussion The aim of this study was to examine the psyc hometric properties of the WHOQOL-BREF in a population of women with breast problems (ben ign or malignant) and examine whether these properties are different when completing only the WHOQOL-BREF or deriving the scores of this questionnaire from the larger WHOQOL-100. Overall, the four-domain model fitted reason ably well in both SG1 and SG2, although respectively three and five covariances had to be allowed between error terms to determine a model that better represented the sample data . The finding that a four-factor structure is not only present in a general population [14] but also in a population of women with breast problems, demonstrates that the WHOQOL-BREF is a generic instrument. Furthermore, the four-factor structure was present when WHOQOL-BREF scores were derived from scores on the WHOQOL-100, and also when WHOQOL-BREF scores were ob tained directly from the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. This result sh ows that the WHOQOL-BREF derived from WHOQOL-100 data, produces a four-factor soluti on comparable to CES-D 177 .145 .032 STAI-State .122 .120 .002 FAS .254 .212 .042 EORTC-body image .039 .038 .001 EORTC-sexual functioning .154 .149 .005 EORTC-future perspective .070 .052 .018 EORTC-breast symptoms .130 .116 .014 | 51 The WHOQOL-BREF appears to be a reliabl e instrument for the use in a breast problem population, both when scores are derived from the WHOQOL-100 and from the WHOQOL-BREF itself. C ronbach's alpha coefficients were . 70 or more for the total scale and separate domains. The internal consistency for Social relationships , however, fell below the threshold in the BC group, the BBP group and the total group in both SG1 and SG2. This finding could at least be partly attributed to the small number of items within this domain (3 items), whereas at least four it ems are recommended to obtain a Cronbach's alpha of at least .70 [57, 58] . Another possible reason for the slightly lowered Cronbach's alpha in the Social relationships domain could be that one of the three items in this domain is about sexuality. However, excluding the item on sexuality resulted in a Cronbach's alpha of .64 instead of .67 in SG1 and .62 instead of .68 in SG2 in th e total group, and the correlation between the sexuality item and the other two items (which are about personal relationships and support from friends) within the domain was .46 and .31 in SG1, and .49 and .32 in SG2. Therefore, no indication was found that the c ontent of this item was related to the lowered Cronbach's alpha. In other validation studies this domain also showed a lowered Cronbach's alpha [20, 31, 59]. Concerning convergent validity, the Physical and Psychological health domains of the WHOQOL-BREF were associated moderately or high ly with the FAS, the STAI, and the CES-D in SG1 and SG2, as expected. Divergent validit y was shown by lower correlations between Social relationships (WHOQOL-BREF) and the STAI-State and CES-D (SG2), and between Environment (WHOQOL-BREF) and the STAI-State (SG2). Results regarding construct validity, and especially convergent validity, were rather comparable between the two study groups and also to other studies that examined the correlations between the WHOQOL-BREF domains and depression scales [26, 33, 60, 61]. Engin and colleagues [62] compared the WHOQ OL-BREF with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; [63]) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; [64]) in idiopathic urticaria patients. Both scores on the BDI and the BAI correlated moderately or highly negative with scores on the WHOQOL-BREF domains Physical health and Psychological health . Regarding fatigue, there is one study that correlated the FAS with the WHOQOL-100, and it emerged that the FAS was highly co rrelated with the WHOQOL-100 facet of Energy and Fatigue [52]. The Physical health domain of the WHOQOL-BREF correlated moderate and significant with the functional scales of th e EORTC QLQ-BR23, as measured in SG1. The Psychological health domain was moderately associated with the facets Body image and Breast symptoms scales and highly with the facet about Future perspective of the EORTC QLQ- BR23. Recently, Den Oudsten et al (2009) show ed comparable results regarding correlations between the WHOQOL-100 and the EORTC QLQ-BR23. A test-retest analysis was done in het BBP and the BC group of SG1, between all time points. Although the shortest time span be tween two succeeding measurements was quite long (two months), correlations were still high, in dicating that the test-retest reliability of the WHOQOL-BREF was good. This result was in lin e with our expectations based on previous 52 | research on the WHOQOL-BREF [20, 36] and th e WHOQOL-100 [17], but has to be interpreted with caution, because of the time span of two months. Furthermore, correlations between Time1 and Time2, and Time1 and Time3 were significant lower in the BC group than in the BBP group (except for the Environment domain), indicating that scores on QOL change more over time in women with BC than in women with BBP. This difference can be attributed to the treatment that women with BC receive and wo men with BBP do not receive. The lowest correlations were found between Time1 and Time3 in the BC group. The results imply that one should administer QOL at three and 12 mont hs after surgery, because correlations are significant lower in the BC group than in the BBP group at those time points. When we compared the predictive value of the WHOQOL-100 domain scores with the WHOQOL-BREF domain scores, the WHOQOL-1 00 predicted depression, anxiety, fatigue and health status 12 months after baseline slightly better. Our op inion was that this difference was too small to overcome the benefit of the much shorter WHOQOL-BREF version. The advantage of the WHOQOL-100 however, is that it has facet-scores in addition to domain scores, which can describe QOL more comprehensive. Some limitations of this study should be pointed out. Firstly, some analyses could not be performed in some of the groups or at a specific time point, for example we could not perform a test-retest analysis on the data of SG2, since we did not administer the WHOQOL- BREF at all time points in that group. The reason s for this limitation are twofold: a) the set of completed questionnaires did not match at all measure moments; b) the first measurement took place while all participating women were in a stressful situation, since women were awaiting diagnosis for their breast problem. Only in the next measurements, women were aware of their diagnosis, and patients were then divided in the two groups: BC patients and patients with a BBP. This diagnostic event between the first and second measurement, for example, made a test-retest analysis between the two measurements unreliable. In future research, questionnaires and measure moments should be matched better with each other, when working with two samples. And to analyze test-retest reliability, the time span between two measure moments should be shortened. Secondly, because the study was aimed at pa tients with breast problems, there were only female respondents. The results may, th erefore, not be applicable to other cancer patient groups and to the small group of male pa tients with BC or BBP, since these patients were not represented in this study. In conclusion, scores on the WHOQOL-B REF derived from WHOQOL-100 data and scores obtained directly from the WHOQOL-BREF are comparable . This implies that they can be used interchangeably, without affecting the results. Furthermore, the WHOQOL-BREF appears to be a reliable and valid instrume nt to measure QOL in women with breast problems. | 53 References 1 .

Quality of Life Research , 20, 865-873. 58 | Abstract Objective The objectives of this study were to examine the differences in health status (HS) of women with breast cancer at different mome nts in time, and between women scoring high and not high on trait anxiety, and to identify possible predictors of HS 6 and 12 months after surgery. Methods Patients (N = 223) completed a trait anxi ety questionnaire before diagnosis. Women who received a diagnosis of breast cancer completed a breast cancer-specific HS questionnaire 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after su rgery. ANCOVA for repeated measures and multiple regression analysis were used in the analyses. Results Women scoring high on trait anxiety had significant ( p < .005) lower Body image, worse Future perspective and Sexual functionin g, and more Side-effects than women who did not score high on trait anxiety. At 6 and 12 mont hs after surgery, the same aspects of HS were predicted by higher trait anxiety scores. Conclusion Higher scores on trait anxiety resulted in worse scores on four HS domains, indicating that there should be more attent ion for this group of patients, even before treatment starts. | 59 Introduction Breast cancer (BC) is the most widespread form of cancer in Europe [1]. Since incidence rates are still increasing but mortality is decreasing [1, 2], more and more women are survivors of BC. For these women, health status (HS), defined as \"well -being in terms of physical, mental, and social condition\" [3], is an important outcome, next to their medical condition. HS has been examined in different studies with various measures, for instance among long-term survivors (>5 years) of BC [4]. In these women, overall HS was fairly good. The most frequently reported complaints were sexual problems an d arm problems [4]. When HS was measured within two years after diagnosis, DiSipio et al [5] found that younger BC survivors (<50 years) one year after diagnosis had a HS comparable with the normal population. Women of 50 years and older already had a HS comparable with the normal population six months after diagnosis. Inconsistent with these results, ot her studies noted that one year after surgery, cognitive and social functioning in BC surviv ors were impaired compared with the normal population [6] and the HS of younger women wa s more impaired than that of older women [7, 8]. There are recent studies that indicate that HS is also affected by socio-economic status and comorbidity [9, 10]. A factor that is associated with the level of HS in BC patients, although not studied frequently, is trait anxiety, i.e., the disposition to experience anxiety in threatening situations. Schreier et al [11] for example, found that trait anxiety correlates negatively with HS scores in BC patients. Trait anxiety also predicted higher levels of distress in BC patients [12], with higher levels of distress being di rectly related to a decrease in HS [13]. A recent study in patients with rectal cancer showed that higher trait anxiety levels predicted worse HS [14]. In this longitudinal, prospective study, trait anxiety was measured in patients before they received a diagnosis. Subsequently, HS wa s measured at different moments in time after diagnosis and treatment. This makes it possible to look at the relation between trait anxiety and the different aspects of HS, as well as looking at the course of HS in time. The goals of this study were to examine (1) whether women who score high on trait anxiety have a different HS across time compared with women who do not score high on trait anxiety, and (2) which factors predict HS si x months and one year after surgery. The expectation was that women who scored high on trait anxiety had a worse HS than women who did not score high on trait anxiety. Furtherm ore, trait anxiety was expected to predict HS at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Methods and patients Patients This study was part of a larger study, conc erning the relationship between personality, surgical treatment and quality of life in women wi th early stage BC. In this larger study, all women visiting the outpatient clinic of the St Elisabeth hospital in Tilburg (from January 2002 until June 2007), the Maasland hospital in Sittard (from June 2004 until March 2006), and the Jeroen Bosch hospital in Den Bosch (from Ja nuary 2006 until June 2007), The Netherlands, 60 | were asked to participate. They were referred by their general practitioner with either a palpable lump in the breast or an abnormalit y on the screening mammography and a negative medical history for breast disease. At their fi rst appointment with a specialized mamma-care nurse (a nurse who is specialized in the care fo r BC patients), they we re informed about the study and when women agreed to participate, th ey completed an informed consent and a set of questionnaires (Time1). This was before th ey knew the diagnosis of the breast problem they visited the outpatient clin ic for. Of the 799 women who visited one of the outpatient clinics with a problem of the breast, 286 (35. 8%) were diagnosed with early stage BC. The other 513 (64.2%) patients appeared to have a benign breast problem. Of the 286 women with BC, 223 (78%) completed the first set of questionnaires, including a questionnaire about trait anxiety. Patients with BC included in th is study were in the situation that they had a choice in their surgical treatment: they could either choose for breast conserving therapy (BCT) or mastectomy (MTC). The BC patients re ceived additional questionnaires at 1 (Time2), 3 (Time3), 6 (Time4) and 12 months (Time5) after surgical treatment (see Figure 1). Exclusion criteria for the current study were not being able to speak and/or read Dutch, having cognitive problems, a medical history with brea st disease, advanced stage BC or a benign breast problem. This study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee (ccMo NL15659.008.06). Fig. 1 Flowchart of the study 179 participants 1 month after surgery 165 participants 12 months after surgery 168 participants 6 months after surgery 172 participants 3 months after surgery Drop-out 3 Drop-out 4 Drop-out 7 Total drop-out 58 (26%) 223 participants before surgery Drop-out 44 | 61 Questionnaires HS was measured at Time2, Time3, Time4, an d Time5 using the validated disease-specific European Organisation for Resear ch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire BC module (EORTC QLQ-BR23) [15, 16]. This 23-item questionnaire is developed for BC patients in different stages of their disease and with varying treatment modalities. The EORTC QLQ-BR23 measures the functional scales Body im age (4 items), Sexual functioning (2 items), Sexual enjoyment (1 item; only to be completed when patient is sexually active), and Future perspective (1 item; \"Were you worried about yo ur health in the future?\") and the disease symptom scales Systemic therapy side-effects (7 items), Breast symptoms (4 items), Arm symptoms (3 items), and Upset by hair loss (1 item; only to be completed if patient had hair loss). Answers vary from 1 ( not at all ) to 4 ( very much ). Higher scores on the functional scales represent a higher level of functioning, while higher scores on the symptom scales represent more symptomatology. Trait anxiety was measured at Time1 with the trait anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at Time1 [17, 18]. Th e STAI measures trait anxiety with 20 items. Answers range from 1 ( almost never ) to 4 ( almost always ). It is a frequently used questionnaire with good psychometric properties [18]. For some analyses the scores on trait anxiety were dichotomized in high or not high. A cut-off score of 44 or higher was used to determine high trait anxiety [18]. The definition of this cut-off score was based on normative data for women between 40 and 59 years [19] , and was construed using the mean score (34.2) plus 1 SD (9.87). Demographic variables included in the stud y were age and marital status. Level of education and work status were assessed to use as an approximation of socio-economic status. Medical Records The following information was retrieved from patie nts' medical files: the disease stage at diagnosis [20], type of operation, and adju vant treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy). Statistical procedure For baseline measures, Chi-square (discrete variables) and independent samples t-tests (continuous variables) were used to compare pa rticipants and non-participants, and the trait anxiety groups (dichotomized in high or not hi gh) with regard to age, partner, children, education, work, disease stage at diagnosis, le vel of trait anxiety, surgical treatment, and adjuvant treatment. ANCOVA for repeated measures was used to examine differences in HS scores between measurements in time and between patients with different trait anxiety scores (dichotomized in high or not high). Ad ditionally, univariate regression analysis was used to select factors for the multivariate lin ear regression analyses (MRA). The dependent variables in the univariate regression were Body image, Sexual functioning, Future 62 | perspective, Systemic therapy side-effects, Breast symptoms and Arm symptoms at Time4 and Time5. Independent variables were age, partner yes/no, children yes/no, education, work yes/no, level of trait anxiety (continuous total score), screening referral yes/no, disease stage at diagnosis, surgical treatment, adjuvant therapy yes/no, chemotherapy yes/no, radiotherapy yes/no, and hormone therapy yes/ no. The significant independent variables of the univariate regression analysis were imported in the backward MRA that was performed to identify those factors that best predicted patients' scores on the EORTC QLQ -BR23 at Time4 and Time5. All analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 14.0. Results Of 286 eligible women with BC, 223 (78%) part icipated in the study. There were no differences in age, disease stage, type of op eration, and receiving adjuvant therapy between participants and non-participants. Demographic and medical information of participants is summarized in Table 1. TABLE 1.

Regarding surgical treatment, 107 women had BCT and 114 women received MTC. Women with BCT and MTC significantly differed on receiving adjuvant therapy and disease stage; i.e., BCT patients more often had adjuvant therapy ( p < .001) and were in a lower disease stage at diagnosis ( p = .002). Women scoring high on trait anxiety (37%) had a lower education level ( p = .005) and were older ( p = .041) than women not scoring high on trait anxiety. There were no differences concerning other demographic and medical factors. Disease stage, receiving adjuvant therapy, type of surgery, educational level, and age were included as cova riates in the subsequent analyses. During the study, 58 women (26%) dropped out within 12 mo nths after surgery. Reasons for drop-out were 'not interested', 'do not want to with the past' or 'too much work' (Figure 1). Participants and drop-outs only differed in age ( p = .008), with drop-outs being older than participants. In the MRA, the total score on trait anxiet y was included following the goal of the study. Age, disease stage, receiving adjuvant th erapy, type of surgery, and educational level were included because these factors differed be tween groups. In addition, significant factors of the univariate analyses were included, namely chemotherapy and screening referral for Body image, marital status for Sexual functi oning, chemotherapy and hormone therapy for Systemic therapy side-effects, and children, ra diotherapy, and screening referral for Breast symptoms (see Table 2).

The covariate type of surgery was also significan t. The BCT group had a higher Body image than 64 | the MTC group at all measurements ( p = .006). More positive Body image scores at Time4 and Time5 was predicted by lower scores on trait anxiety, BCT, and older age. Receiving chemotherapy predicted a more negative Body image, but only at Time4 (Table 3). Women who did not score high on trait anxiety, had a more positive Future perspective than women who did score high on trait anxiety ( p <. 001) (see Figure 2). The latter group had a more unusual course of Fu ture perspective. Between Time3 and Time4 their Future perspective dropped seriously ( p < .001). At Time5 their Future perspective had increased to approximately their Time2 level. This pattern is reflected in the interaction effect of time and trait anxiety ( p < .001). More positive Future perspective at Time4 was predicted by lower scores on trait anxiety and older age. Trait anxiety was the only predictor of more positive Future perspective at Time5 (Table 3) , i.e., lower scores on trait anxiety predicted higher Future perspective.

There was an interaction effect between time and chemotherapy, showing that the course of Se xual functioning for wo men with or without chemotherapy differed across time ( p = .045). Two different factors predicted better Sexual functioning at Time4 and Time5, namely lower sc ores on trait anxiety and having a partner. Younger age was a predictor of a higher level of Sexual functioning at Time5 (Table 3). Symptom Scales Women high on trait anxiety reported mo re side-effects than the other women ( p = .001) (Figure 3). There was an interaction ef fect between time and chemotherapy ( p = .012) reflecting that women without chemotherapy have a constant level of side-effects across time and women with chemotherapy experienced a major increase in side-effects three months after surgery. Side-effects decreased towards 12 months after surgery, but the level stayed above that of wo men without chemotherapy. Receiving chemotherapy and a higher sco re on trait anxiety were significant predictors of more side-effects at Time4. At Time5, only higher scores on trait anxiety significantly predicted more side-effects (see Table 4). Trait anxiety did not interfere with Breast symptoms, but type of surgery did. BCT resulted in significantly ( p = .007) more Breast symptoms than MTC. More Breast symptoms at Time4 were predicted by receiving radiothe rapy, a lower educational level and not having children. Educational level remained a predicto r at Time5, and receiving BCT predicted more Breast symptoms (Table 4). 66 | Arm symptoms differed between women in different disease stages ( p = .015). A higher disease stage resulted in more Arm sy mptoms. Worse scores on Arm symptoms at Time4 and Time5 were predicted by lo wer educational level (Table 4).

HS contains six domains in this study, and four of those domains, namely Body image, Future perspectiv e, Sexual functioning, and Side effects were negatively affected by trait anxiety. Trait anxiety One of the goals of this study was to examine if there were differences in HS between women who scored high on trait anxiety and women who did not score high on trait anxiety. Based on earlier studies [11, 12, 21], we expected that women with a high score on trait anxiety would have lower scores on HS. Indeed trait anxiety se emed to play an important role in the HS of women with BC, especially with regard to Body image, Future perspectiv e, Sexual functioning, and Side effects. On these scales of the EO RTC QLQ-BR23, women who scored high on trait anxiety had significant worse outcome than wome n who did not score high on trait anxiety, even 12 months after surgical treatment. A remark able result was, for example, the course of Future perspective of women with high scores on trait anxiety (Figure 2). There is a significant decrease in their Future perspective 6 months after surgery took place. An explanation could be that when treatment has ended, patients ar e uncertain about how to pick up their lives. Furthermore, trait anxiety was the only fa ctor that significantly and negatively predicted Body image, Future perspective and Sexual function ing at 6 and 12 months after surgery, implying that other factors such as disease stage and treatment have less impact on HS than this personality trait. Comparable results were found in three other studies, even though in these studies (health related) quality of life [11, 21] and psychological stress [12] were used as outcome measures. Moreover, higher trait anxiety predicted more Systemic therapy side-effects at 6 and 12 months after surgery (Figure 3). This could be due to the fact that patients scoring high on trait anxiety believe that they will experience mo re side effects of their systemic therapy, as mentioned in the study of Cameron and colleague s [22]. There was no relation between trait anxiety and Arm and Breast symptoms. Demographic factors Another factor besides trait anxiety that pred icted more than one domain of HS was age. Older age predicts a better Body image at 6 an d 12 months after surgery and a more positive perspective on the future at 6 months afte r surgery. Multiple explanations could be considered here. One possibility is that youn ger women more often have an advanced stage of BC, or a more aggressive tumor. In thes e cases, treatment can be more invasive and mutilating, and more often includes chemotherapy , which is also a predictor for worse HS [5, 7]. Another explanation could be that a diag nosis of BC and the subsequent treatment possibly disrupts the course of life more in yo unger women than in older women [23, 24]. 68 | Contrary to the previous result where older age was related to more positive outcomes, better Sexual functi oning at 12 months after surgery was predicted by younger age. Presumably, this has a relation with me nopause and menopausal symptoms. Most older women have past their menopause, but in yo unger women, only those who had systemic therapy might have menopausal symptoms whic h can lead to decrea sed sexual enjoyment [7]. This relation between age and Sexual f unctioning was also found in other studies that used the EORTC QLQ-BR23 [25, 26]. Other demographic factors with an influenc e on HS were educational level, having children, and having a partner. A higher educ ational level predicted less Breast and Arm symptoms at 6 months after surgery, and less Breast symptoms at 12 months after surgery. Earlier research revealed the same relation between education and Breast and Arm symptoms [27]. A possible reason for this co uld be that higher educated women are more likely to learn about how to take care of their wounds and how to exercise and use their arm. Having children predicted less Breast symptoms at 6 months after surgery and having a partner predicted better Sexual function ing at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Disease specific factors: treatment Type of surgery had a significant relation with Body image: women that had BCT had a better Body image than women that had MT C, during the 12 months after surgery. This outcome is also supported by multiple studie s [28-30]. A more unexpected result was that women with BCT reported much more Breast sy mptoms than women that had MTC. BCT also significantly predicted more Breast symptoms at Time5. Since MTC is medically more invasive than BCT, it would be obvious to expect that MTC causes more Breast symptoms. The current outcome could possibly be attributed to treatmen t features: in BCT radiotherapy is part of regular treatment, while women that have MTC almost never receive radiotherapy. Radiotherapy can therefore not be seen apart fr om type of surgical treatment. From the regression analysis we also learned that not receiving radiotherapy was a predictor for less Breast symptoms. These facts together can obviously explain why women with BCT have more Breast symptoms: radiotherapy can cause irritation of the skin and wounds heal slower [31]. Another possible explanation is a linguistic one: in the questionnaire women are asked about complaints in the area of their affe cted breast. Perhaps, women that had an MTC reason that they do not have a breast anymor e (for MTC removes the breast in total) and they do not report possible compla ints as complaints of their brea st. In the study of King et al [27] there was no significant difference reported in Breast symptoms between BCT and MTC and apart from that study there is no specific lit erature about this topic, so more research is needed to clarify this result. Besides type of surgery, there were ot her treatment factors that predicted HS. Receiving chemotherapy predicted more side -effects and worse Body image at Time4. Radiotherapy predicted worse Future perspective and more Breast symptoms at Time4. These results are in line with a recent study on adju vant therapy and health related quality of life | 69 [32]. In contrast to what Buij s et al [33] found, there was a relation between hormone therapy and Arm symptoms: receiving horm one therapy predicted less Arm symptoms at Time5. This could have a relation with other factors, like radiotherapy, but more research needs to be done about this topic. Limitations of this study In this study only women with early stage BC were included (Table 1). An advantage is the homogeneity of the data, but the disadvantage is that it is not possible to generalize the conclusions to other patient groups, such as late -stage or recurrent BC patients. Furthermore, there was a selection effect on two items of the EORTC QLQ- BR23: the items about 'Upset by hair loss' and 'Sexual enjoyment' only had to be answered if women actually did have hair loss or were sexually active, respectively. Due to these criteria, not en ough patients answered the questions to evaluate them in this study. To counter this problem and other potential power problems, more women need to be included in future research. In this study, radiotherapy was introduc ed as an independent variable. We realize that there is an overlap between radiotherapy and type of surgery, i.e., usually women who receive BCT also get radiotherapy. Likewise, radiotherapy is usually not a part of MTC treatment. However, because in this study th ere were 10 women (9.3% of BCT) who received BCT, but not radiotherapy and 20 women (17.5% of MTC) who received MTC and radiotherapy, we decided to maintain radiotherapy as an independent variable. In conclusion, trait anxiety is strongly associated with the HS of BC pati ents in the first year after surgery. This insight in personality of pa tients could be a first indication for better monitoring patients that have a higher risk of having a worse HS after diagnosis and treatment of their disease. Since HS is an im portant endpoint of treatment in BC patients nowadays, psychosocial support should be deploy ed to guide these high risk patients through the process of their disease and possibly thereafter. Furthermore it should not be accepted unquestioningly that women who had BCT, do better than women with MTC. The results fr om this study pointed out that even though BCT is medically spoken a less invasive treatm ent than MTC, BCT-patients can have serious Breast symptoms. There should therefore be close attention for medical and psychosocial symptoms in women with MTC and BCT. The results of this study also have clinical implications. Based on the present results, women scoring high on anxiety are prone to ex periencing more side-effects. Psychological counseling aimed at these women, could probably reduce side-effects. However, in order to provide this treatment, high anxious women shou ld be identified using short, validated easy to administer trait anxiety questionnaires, such as the STAI [17, 18]. 70 | References 1 .

An anxiety disorder in the past is a risk factor for psychological distress and worse quality of life in breast cancer patients. Submitted for publication . 74 | Abstract Objective There is a substantial subgroup of women with breast cancer that has experienced an anxiety disorder in their lives. The aims of this study are 1) to examine the role of having a history of an anxiety disorder (HAD) on the cour se of psychological distress and quality of life (QOL) in the two years after primary treatmen t of breast cancer, and 2) to examine the relationship between ha ving HAD and patients' personalit y characteristics and health care utilization. Methods Patients were recruited in four Dutch hospitals. Participants completed a set of questionnaires before diagnosis and subsequently received questionnaires at one, three, six, 12, and 24 months after surgery. A diagnostic interview was administered 12 months after surgery to assess lifetime anxiety disorders. Frequencies, t-tests, Chi-square, ANOVA, and mixed model were used to analyse the data. Results An anxiety disorder was diagnosed in 21 of 143 patients (15%). Patients with HAD less often received hormones, scored higher on trai t anxiety and neuroticism, had more contacts with their general practitioner in the two year s after breast cancer di agnosis, and had worse scores on state anxiety, fatigue, Physical QOL, and Environmental QOL compared with patients without HAD. There was an intera ction-effect for future perspective. Conclusion Having HAD is a risk factor for worse scor es on state anxiety, fatigue, physical, and environmental QOL. Information on the anxiety history of a patient becomes therefore very useful in determining the level of offered ps ychological support to newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. | 75 Introduction In the western countries, one in eight women will get the diagnosis breast cancer (BC) in her life [1, 2]. Many women also experience an epis ode of severe anxiety or phobia in their lives, which can be labeled as a clinical anxiety disord er [3]. This means that there is a substantial subgroup of women with BC that has experienced a period of clinical anxiety in their lives. A meta-analysis by Mitchell et al. [4] showed that the prevalence of anxiety disorders in cancer patients is 10.3% and a study by Teesson et al [5] showed that the 12 months prevalence of any anxiety disorder in cancer patients was 22.5%. In patient groups, not much longitudinal research has been done on the relation between clinical anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms, anxiety, fatigue, and quality of life (QOL). In cancer research there are a few cr oss-sectional studies that reported a relation between anxiety disorders and physical impairme nt [6], and anxiety disorders and decreased QOL [7, Two studies [9, 10] showed that a depr essive or anxiety disorder in the past was a predictor for having another depressive or anxiety disorder in BC patients. There are no studies that prospectively examined the mental well-being and QOL of BC patients with a history of anxiety disorder s (HAD). Our research is unique in combining data from a prospective cohort study with clin ical assessment of anxiety disorders in women with BC, thereby examining lifetime anxiety disord er as a risk factor for psychological distress and QOL. To make tailored psychological care for BC patients possible, it is necessary to determine the predictors of psychological morbidity. Therefore, we compared BC patients with HAD with patients without such a history. One aim of this study was to examine the role of an anxiety disorder earlier in life, i.e., before the diagnosis BC, on the course of depressive symptoms, state anxiety, fatigue, QOL, and health status (HS) in the two years after primary treatment of BC. We expected HAD to be a ri sk factor for worse scores on depressive symptoms, state anxiety, fatigue, QOL, and HS. The other aim was to examine the relationship between having HAD and patients ' personality characteristics and health care utilization. We expected that patients with HAD would more of ten have an anxiety-prone, neurotic, and Type D personality and would have more health care consultations compared with patients without HAD. Methods Patients This study was part of a prospective multicent er study in which women that were referred to the outpatient clinic of the St Elisabeth hosp ital in Tilburg, the Catharina hospital in Eindhoven, the Jeroen Bosch hospital in Den Bo sch, and the VieCuri hospital in Venlo, the Netherlands, by the national screening progra m or their general practitioner (GP) between 2007 and 2010 were asked to pa rticipate. A specialized mamma-care nurse informed the patients about the study during their first appo intment, during which the diagnosis of their breast problem was not yet known. When women agreed to participate in the study, they 76 | completed an informed consent and a set of questionnaires (Time0). All participants subsequently received questionnaires at one (Tim e1), three (Time2), six (Time3), 12 (Time4), and 24 months (Time5) after surgical treatmen t. In addition, a diagnostic interview was administered at Time4 to assess lifeti me clinical anxiety disorders. The study is approved by the Medical Ethical Committee (ccMo NL15659.008.06) and registered at the Dutch Trial Register (NTR1555). Questionnaires Lifetime anxiety disorders (Panic disorder, Ge neralized anxiety disorder, Social phobia, and Agora phobia) were assessed with the World Health Organization Co mposite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) [11] . This is a structured clinical interview of which the anxiety part was used in this study. The CIDI was administered at Time4. Reliability of the CIDI is good to excellent, and the validity is de monstrated to be good [12]. State anxiety, i.e., the level of momentary anxiety, was measured with the 6-item State scale of the short version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The presence and degree of depressive symptoms were measured with the 16-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES -D) [13, 14]. The 10-item Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) [15] was used to measure fati gue. All three questionnaires have good psychometric properties [16-19], and were completed at all measure moments. To assess QOL, the World Health Organizati ons Quality of Life instrument, short form (WHOQOL-BREF) [20] was used. The reliability and validity of this 26-item questionnaire are reported to be good in women with breast problems [21]. Patients completed this questionnaire at Time0, Time4, and Time5. HS was measured using the validated 23 -item BC-specific EORTC QLQ-BR23 of the European Organisation for Research and Treatm ent of Cancer [22, 23]. Patients completed the EORTC QLQ-BR23 at Time1-Time5. Trait anxiety, i.e., a personality trait that reflects the disposition to experience anxiety in threatening situations, was measured with the 10-item Trait part of the short version of the STAI [24, 25]. The personality trait neuroticism was measured with the neuroticism part (12 items) of the Neuroticis m-Extraversion-Openness-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) [26, 27]. The reliability and validity of these two questionnaires are acceptable to good [27, 28]. Patients completed both personality questionnaires at Time0. Type D personality, i.e., the tendency to experience both high negative affect and social inhibition, was measured with the 14-item Type D Personality Scale (DS14) [29]. Validity and reliability were good in multiple la nguages and (patient) populations [29-33]. Demographics and health care utilization Demographic data were assessed by self-repor t questions concerning age, marital status, having children, education level, and work status. | 77 Health care utilization (medical specialists, hospital stay, GP, psychosocial health care, cancer program, physical therapist, dieticia n, and alternative therapist) in the two years after initial treatment was measured by self-rep ort questions. All contacts were measured as yes or no. Only for GP visits also the number of contacts was registered. Medical Information Information on disease stage at diagnosis [34], type of operation, number of operations, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy was retrieved from patients' medical files. Statistical procedure Frequencies were used to report the prevalence of anxiety disorders in patients with BC. T- tests and Chi-square were used to determine potential differences between patients that participated in the CIDI interview and patients that refused the interview. To compare BC patients with and without HAD on having a partner (no/yes), having children (no/yes), having work (no/yes), education level (low/m edium/high), way of referring (by national screening program or GP), ty pe of surgical trea tment (lumpectomy or mastectomy), disease stage at diagnosis, number of operations, chemotherapy (no/yes), radiotherapy (no/yes), hormone therapy (no/yes), health care utilization (medical specialists, hospital stay, GP, psychosocial health care, canc er program, physical therapist, dietician, and alternative therapist; all no/yes), and Type D personality Chi-square tests were used. One-way ANOVA was used to compare BC patients with and without HAD on trait anxiety (Time0), neuroticism (Time0), NA (Time0), SI (Time0), and health care utilization (number of GP contacts) at Time4 and Time5. Mixed model repeated measures (Toeplitz) was used to analyse the scores of BC patients with and without HAD on state anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, QOL, and HS across time. All analyses were performed with the Statis tical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0. Results The CIDI was administered to 143 BC patients. Pa tients that participated in the interview did not differ from patients that refused part icipation on demographic variables, medical variables, and personality scores at Time0, an d on state anxiety scores, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and QOL at Time4, i.e., the moment that patients were invited to participate in the interview. An anxiety disorder was diagnosed in 21 pati ents (15%), of whom four patients (3%) still had an anxiety disorder at the time of assessment that developed before the BC diagnosis, and two patients (1%) developed th e anxiety disorder around or shortly after the diagnosis of BC. Those two patients were omitted from the analyses. Demographic and medical information of the pati ents is shown in Table 1. 78 | There were no significant differences in having a partner, children, and work, screening referral, education leve l, type of surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy), stadium of disease at diagnosis, number of operations, receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and Type D personality between patients with an d without HAD. However, patients with HAD were less often treated with hormones. Patients with HAD scored significantly higher on trait anxiety and neuroticism, and those patients had significantly more contacts with their GP in the two years after diagnosis than patients without HAD (Table2).

State anxiety and depressive symptoms decreased in the first year after surgery, but increased between Time4 and Time5 in both groups. Fatigue increased until Time3, decrea sed between Time3 and Time4, and increased again between Time4 and Time5. Physical QOL on ly decreased in the two years after surgery. Social QOL decreased between Time0 and Time 4, and remained stable after Time4, and Sexual functioning increased in the two years after surgery. Fig. 1 The course of Future perspective measur ed at 5 time points for breast cancer patients with and without a hi story of an anxiety disorder 80 | It also showed that patients with HAD had significant worse scores on state anxiety, fatigue, physical QOL, and environmental QO L compared with patients without HAD. There was an interaction-effect for future perspective; for patients with HAD future perspective fluctuated until Time4, but dras tically decreased between Time4 and Time5. Patients without HAD had an overall increase of future perspective, although there was a slight decrease between Time4 and Time5 (Figure 1). Discussion The aim of this study was twofold: first, we want ed to examine the role of an anxiety disorder earlier in life, i.e., before the diagnosis BC, on the course of depressive symptoms, state anxiety, fatigue, and QOL in the two years af ter primary treatment of BC. The other aim was to examine the relationship between having HAD and patients' personality characteristics and health care utilization. For the whole group, so irrespective of whether or not a history of an anxiety diagnosis, scores on state anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, physical QOL, social QOL, and sexual functioning changed over time. Stat e anxiety, depressive symptoms, and fatigue deteriorated between Time4 and Time5. HAD was diagnosed in 15% of the patients . Our hypothesis that patients with HAD would more often have an anxiety-prone, neurot ic, and Type D personality, was only partly confirmed. Patients with HAD in deed had higher scores on trait anxiety and neuroticism, but this did not apply to Type D personality and it s two components negative affect and social inhibition. Previous research on the relationship between clinical anxiety disorders and personality is scarce, but there are two studies [ 35, 36] that show a positive relation between neuroticism and clinical anxiety disorders. This research was not done in cancer patients. Patients with HAD also had worse scores on state anxiety, fatigue, physical, and environmental QOL than patients without HAD. This result is in line with previous literature on coronary [37, 38] and cancer patients [7-10] . The only factor that showed an interaction effect was future perspective, one of the f unctional scales of the HS questionnaire. For patients with HAD future perspective decreased drastically between Time4 and Time5. This means that women with BC and HAD tend to be come extremely worried about their health in the future, from one year after initial treatmen t onwards. One explanation could be that after one year active treatment is minimized, and the patient becomes insecure because there are much less checkups by the specialist [39]. Taking the above results into account, the need for screening on HAD in women with BC is apparent. When the treating professional is informed about the patients' history regarding anxiety disorders, tailored psychologi cal care can be offered. In this study, we screened patients by means of a structured clin ical interview (CIDI). The CIDI is, however, not very practical to use as part of routine clinic al practice, but there are other possibilities to check the anxiety disorder history of a patient. One option is to ask patients about their history of anxiety disorders. And since anxiety disorders and trait anxiety appear to be | 81 strongly related, another option is to use a sh ort trait anxiety inventory, i.e., the STAI Short Form (trait part; 10 items), to assess trait anxiety and, thereby, anxiety-proneness. Patients with HAD were also less likely to be treated with hormonal therapy and consulted their GP more often than patients wi thout HAD. Thus, the expectation that patients with HAD would have more health care consultations was correct for GP consults in the two years after initial treatment. This result was in concordance with the results of the study of Revicki et al. [40]. A recent study on health ca re utilization in patients with breast problems [41] also showed that trait anxiety was a predictor for more GP consultations. The result that patients with HAD were less often treated with hormones was surprising. Hormonal treatment was measured as indicated by the doctor in attendance at the start of the possible adjuvant treatment and not as (self-reported) hormonal medicine adherence. As far as we know, there is nothin g mentioned in the literature that could explain this. Presumably, there is a mediating or moderating factor that adds to this phenomenon. Our analyses showed that there is no difference in stage of the disease and type of surgery (two factors that could possibly account for th e difference in hormonal treatment) between the two groups. It would be interesting and nece ssary to further explore this relationship. This study has several strengths, including the assessments of anxiety disorders using the CIDI and the comprehensive set of da ta on the patients. However, there are also several limitations that must be considered. One limitation is that there is a difference between patients in elapsed time since the actu al anxiety disorder, which we could not take into account. This could affect the scores. Anot her limitation is that the patient population in this study was too small to divide them into more groups. This would have been interesting, for example to look at pa tients with or without HAD and different treatment modalities. In summary, our results implicate that, over all, having HAD is a risk factor for worse scores on state anxiety, fatigue, physical, and environmental QOL. Moreover, having HAD was related to higher scores on neuroticism and trai t anxiety. Information on the anxiety history of a patient becomes, therefore, very useful in determining the level of offered psychological support to newly diagnosed BC patients.

The questionnaire set consisted of questionnaires on demographics, state anxiet y, depressive symptoms, fatigue, QOL, neuroticism, and trait anxiety. Chi-square tests, independent samples t-tests, and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to do the analyses. Results Before their diagnosis of breast cancer, 111 women (28%) had CADS. Of the CADS- group, a higher percentage had elevated levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and CADS at all follow-up moments than of the non-CADS-group. CADS-score at before diagnosis and neuroticism were the most important predictors of outcome measures at Time1 and Time2. Conclusion More than one in four women, who later received the diagnosis breast cancer, had elevated levels of both state anxiety and depr essive symptoms just before diagnosis. This factor was also a major predictor of QOL, stat e anxiety, depressive symptoms, and fatigue 12 and 24 months after surgery. This implies that women with a higher score on both depressive symptoms and anxiety should be id entified as soon as possible in the process of diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer using validated quest ionnaires or screening instruments. Only by identifying this group of patients, tailore d psychological care can be accomplished. | 87 Introduction In Europe, breast cancer (BC) incidence has increased from 76 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1995 to 88 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2008. Mortality, however, decreased from 27.3 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1995 to 24.3 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2008 [1, 2], resulting in a growing group of BC survivors every year. Both anxiety and depressive symptoms ar e common in cancer patients. A recent meta-analysis showed a prevalence of clinical depression of 16.3% and a prevalence of all types of depression in 20.7% of oncological an d haematological patients. Anxiety prevalence was 10.3% [3]. In this meta-analysis only stud ies that used a clinical interview to assess depression and anxiety were included. Massie [4] reviewed the literature on the prevalence of depression/depressive symptoms in patients with cancer and concluded that in women with BC the prevalence of depression/depre ssive symptoms ranged from 1.5% to 46%, depending on the instrument used to assess depr ession and the characteristics of the patient group. Although many studies mention the co-existence of depressive symptoms and elevated anxiety levels, there is not much information on the prevalence of combined anxiety/depressive symptoms (CADS) in women with BC. Brintzenhofe-Szoc [5] published a cross-sectional study in which the prevalence of CADS in cancer patients was presented. In BC patients 2.8% had only depressive symptoms, 14.9% had only anxiety symptoms, and 10.8% had CADS. A study in Hong Kong [6] showed that 21.1% had elevat ed anxiety symptoms, 34.4% had elevated depressive symptoms, and 15.6% had both. According to Ollonen et al. [7] and Eskelinen and Ollonen [8] 18% had modera te depressive symptoms and 12% often had feelings of anxiety, but there was no information on the combination of depressive symptoms and anxiety. It is important to focus on the effects of baseline anxiety and depressive symptoms levels on quality of life (QOL) in the period af ter initial treatment of BC, since anxiety and depressive symptoms are manageable factors if a patient receives psychological counseling. The literature on the relationship of anxiety and/or depression with QOL is, however, scarce. A few cross-sectional studies reported a negati ve correlation between depression and QOL [6, 9-12], anxiety and QOL an d QOL [6, 11] in BC patients. In the study of Schreier and Williams [13] state anxiety was nega tively associated with QOL at the start of treatment, and higher levels of state anxiety we re a significant predictor of decreased QOL at one year after the start of treatment. Also, changes in depressive symptoms scores were shown to be a predictor of QOL six months after baseline measure [14], and there is one recent study [15] that showed that depressive symptoms at baseline predicted worse health- related QOL at six, 12, and 24 months after su rgery, and anxiety at baseline predicted worse health-related QOL at six and 12 months after surgery. The quality and methodology of those studies was far from optimal, most were cross-sectional [6, 9-12], some had a low number of participants (N < 75) [9, 10, 13], and the meas urement instruments were not always validated [14]. 88 | In this multicentre prospective study, we therefore determined the relationship between anxiety, depressive symptoms, and CA DS (measured before diagnosis) with QOL, fatigue, and mood one and two years after surg ery in women with BC. Since previous studies showed that personality factors influence the QO L of women with BC [13, 16-18], trait anxiety and neuroticism were also included in this st udy. We hypothesized that CADS, more than elevated levels of anxiety or depressive sympto ms alone, would be a significant predictor for QOL, fatigue, state anxiety, and depressive symptoms one and two years after surgery. Methods and patients Patients Women referred by the national screening progra m or their general practitioner (GP) to the outpatient clinic of the St Elisabeth hospital (Tilburg), the Maasland hospital (Sittard), the Jeroen Bosch Alkmaar (Alkmaar), or the Catharina Hospital (Eindho ven) in the Netherlands between 2003 and 2010, were asked to participate in this study. A specialized mamma-care nurse informed the patients about the study during their first ap pointment. When women agreed to participate in the study, they completed an informed consent and a set of questionnaires (Time0). Women were not yet informed ab out the diagnosis of their breast problem at the time they completed the first set of questionnaires. The wo men who appeared to have BC subsequently received questionnaires at 12 (Time1) and 24 months (Time2) after surgical treatment. Exclusion criteria were: not being able to complete Dutch questionnaires for linguistic, cognitive or psychiatric reasons, an d a medical history with breast disease. The Dutch Medical Ethical Committee (ccMo NL15659.008.06) approved this study. Questionnaires State anxiety, i.e., the level of momentary anxiety, was measured with the State scale of the short version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The STAI State short version consists of 6 items [19] and it has good reliability and validity [19, 20]. The answers range from 1 (almost never ) to 4 ( almost always ). The total score ranges from 6 to 24. To define a CADS- score (high level of anxiety and high level of depressive symptoms at Time0) state anxiety scores were dichotomized in high or not high. High state anxiety was defined by a score of 14 or higher [19, 21]. Patients completed th is questionnaire at all measure moments. The presence and degree of depressive symptoms over the past week were measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) [22]. This is a 20-item self-report scale. The CES-D showed to have good psychometric properties in BC patients [23]. In this study the 16-item version [24] was used, which consists of negative formulated items only. It was found to be a more valid assessment of depressive symptoms in cancer patients [24]. The rating scale ranges from 0 ( seldom or never ) to 3 ( (almost) always ), and total scores can range from 0 to 48. To define the CADS-score depressive symptoms scores were dichotomized in high or not high by a cut-off score of 12, based on the ratio of | 89 high and not-high scores in the 20-item scale. Patients completed this questionnaire at all measure moments. The 10-item Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) [25] was used to measure fatigue. The FAS has a 5-point response scale ranging from 1 ( never) to 5 ( always ); thus, scores on the FAS can range from 10 to 50. The reliability and valid ity of the FAS appeared to be good in women with breast problems [26]. Patients complete d this questionnaire at all measure moments. To assess QOL, the World Health Organizati ons Quality of Life instrument, short form (WHOQOL-BREF) [27] was used. Th is 26-item questionnaire consists of four domains (Physical health, Psychological health, Soci al relationships, and Environment) and two items concerning Overall QOL and General health. The WHOQOL-B REF has a 5-point Likert response scale ranging from 1 ( not poor ) to 5 ( extremely/always/very satisfied/very good ). The questions refer to the previous two weeks. Higher scores indicate a better QOL. Reliability and validity are reported to be good in women with breast problems [28]. Patients completed this questionnaire at all measure moments. The personality trait neuroticism was measured by the neuroticism part (12 items) of the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness-Five Fa ctor Inventory (NEO-FFI) [29, 30]. The reliability and validity of this questionnaire are acceptable to good [29]. The NEO-FFI has a 5- point response scale ranging from 1 ( totally disagree) to 5 ( totally agree ). Scores can range from 12 to 60. Patients completed th is questionnaire only at Time0. Trait anxiety, i.e., a personality trait that reflects the disposition to experience anxiety in threatening situations , was measured with the Trait part of the short version of the STAI [31, 32]. This short version of the STAI Trait has 10 items and has good psychometric properties [33]. The answers range from 1 ( almost never ) to 4 ( almost always ), so total scores can range from 10 to 40. Patients comple ted this questionnaire only at Time0. Demographics Demographic data were assessed by self-repor t questions concerning age, marital status, having children, education level, and work status. Medical Information Information on disease stage at diagnosis [34] , type of operation, and adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy ) was retrieved from patients' medical files. Statistical procedure To compare patients with and without CADS at Time0 they were divided in two groups: patients that had high anxiety and depressive symptoms (CADS-group) at Time0 and patients that did not have high anxiety and depressive symptoms at Time0 (non-CADS-group), based on the cut-off scores of the anxiety and depressive symptoms questionnaires. To compare participants and non-participan ts on diagnosis and way of referring (by national screening program or GP) Chi-square tests were used. Age of participants and non- 90 | participants was compared with independent samples t-test. Frequencies were used to examine the level of anxiety and depressive symptoms at all measurement points in the CADS- and the non-CADS-group. Multivariate linear regression analyses (method backward) were done to predict scores on QOL, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and fatigue at Time1 en Time2. The dependent variables in the multivariate regression an alyses were the domains of the WHOQOL-BREF (Physical health, Psychological health, Social relationships, and Environment), Overall QOL and General health, state anxiety score, depressive symptoms score, and fatigue score at Time1 and Time2. Independent variables were age, pa rtner no/yes, children no/yes, education, work no/yes, screening referral no/yes, disease stage at diagnosis, surgical treatment (lumpectomy or mastectomy), chemotherapy no/yes, radiotherapy no/yes, hormone therapy no/yes, state anxiety score at symptoms sc ore at Time0, CADS at Time0 (no/yes), trait anxiety score, and neuroticism score. All analys es were performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0. Results Of the 2425 women who visited one of the outpat ient clinics with a problem of the breast, 1501 (62%) agreed to participate in the stud y. The most important reason for women to decline participation was the timing of the incl usion, namely in the period they awaited the diagnosis of their breast problem. Most women reported they had too much stress to complete a questionnaire. Of the 1501 women that agreed to participate, 407 (27%) received the diagnosis BC. The remaining 1093 women had a benign breast problem. Between Time0 and Time1 75 women dropped out of the study, between Time1 and Time2 24 women dropped out. Since 62 women were included in the study less than two years before analyses were done, their data on Time 2 was missing (see Figure 1).

The demogr aphic and medical characteristics of the participants with BC are summarized in Table 1. TABLE 1.

A year later 14% of th e women had CADS and after two years this percentage had decreased to 10%. Elevated depressive symptoms and state anxiety was found in respectively 21% and 20% of the total group, both at Time 1 and Time2. Of the group that had CADS at Time0, a higher percentage of women had elevated levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and CADS at Time1 and Time2 than of the group that did not have CADS at Time0 (Figure 2). The multivariate regression analyses sh owed that having CADS at Time0 was a significant predictor for worse Physical health, Psychological health, Overall QOL, and anxiety at Time1, and for worse scores on all outcome measures except Social relationships at Time2. A higher level of depressive symptoms at Time0 predicted worse scores on Social relationships, depressive symptoms, and fatigue at Time1. 92 | Fig. 2 High anxiety and/or depressive symptoms in CADS and non-CADS groups defined at baseline. Note. CADS = combined anxiety and depressive symptoms at baseline; Anx = anxiety; DS = depressive symptoms The personality trait neuroticism was a si gnificant predictor for all QOL domains, depressive symptoms, and fatigue assessed at Time1 and Time2. Neuroticism also predicted state anxiety scores at Time1. Trait anxiety was predictive for the QOL domain Environmental health and state anxiety at Time1, and for all outcome measures, except Physical health, at Time2. Furthermore, some medical factors predic ted outcomes. A higher disease stage at diagnosis predicted worse Physical health an d fatigue at Time2. Having a lumpectomy predicted worse Social relationships at Time1 a nd better Overall QOL at Time2 compared with a mastectomy. Surprisingly, receiving chemothe rapy predicted less fatigue at Time1, and receiving hormone therapy predicted better Physical and Environmental health, better Overall QOL, and less fatigue at Time2. Finally, there were demographic variables th at played a role in QOL at Time1 and Time2. Having a job at Time0 was a predictor fo r better Physical health at Time2. A higher educational level predicted better Environmenta l health at Time2, and higher age at Time0 predicted better Psychological health at Time1 (Tables 2 and 3). | 93 TABLE 2.

QOL = quality of life; CADS = combined anxiety and depressive symptoms at Time0 | 95 Discussion At baseline, 28% of the women that would la ter receive the diagnosis BC had CADS. This CADS-group had elevated levels of state anxiet y, depressive symptoms and CADS at all follow- up measure moments in the two years after base line compared with the non-CADS-group. In both groups these scores decreased over time, but after 24 months the CADS, state anxiety, and depressive symptoms scores of the CADS gro up were still about three times as high as the scores in the non-CADS group. This implies that the CADS group experiences considerably more anxiety and/or depressive symptoms even 24 months after surgery. As hypothesized, CADS, more than anxiety and depressive symptoms alone, significantly predicted patients' QOL, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and state anxiety 12 and 24 months after surgery. It especially predicted worse outcomes at 24 months after surgery. This implies that, in addition to stable persona lity characteristics such as neuroticism and trait anxiety, also a combination of situational factors can predict the psychological well-being of women with BC, even up to 2 years after their in itial surgery. Those results were comparable with two cross-sectional studies on the rela tionship between CADS and QOL [6, 11]. Another important predictor of QOL, fatigu e, depressive symptoms, and anxiety 12 and 24 months after surgery was neuroticism. In BC, there is ample research on the predictive value of neuroticism on QOL, fatigue, and mood [16, 18, 35-37]. One study found that neuroticism was a significant predictor of QOL tw o years after initial surgery [18], and a cross- sectional study showed a positive relationship between neuroticism and fatigue in disease- free BC survivors [35]. These findings are consistent with results from studies with other cancer patient groups [38-42]. Studies in th e general population found that neuroticism is positively associated with physical complaints , psychological symptoms, QOL, and health costs [43, 44]. In the Netherlands, a recent st udy showed that health costs associated with neuroticism were about 2.5 times as high as heal th costs of common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression [45]. Not much resear ch has been performed on the relationship between trait anxiety and QOL either. The availa ble studies showed that BC patients scoring high on trait anxiety generally scor e lower on QOL [12, 16, 17, 46]. The most unexpected outcome was the positive effect of chemotherapy on fatigue at Time1 and the positive effect of hormone th erapy on Physical and Environmental Health, Overall QOL, and fatigue at Time2. We found no studies with the same result regarding the positive effect of receiving chemotherapy on fati gue. A possible explanation for this effect at Time1 may be that women who received chemot herapy rate their QOL and fatigue according to their subjective situation, so they take the physical and psyc hological consequences of this medication into account. The questionnaires were completed a year after surgery, so also after completion of the chemotherapy treatmen t. Sometimes this phenomenon is referred to as a form of response shift [47, 48]. For hormone therapy there are studies th at report on QOL outcomes, but most studies compare different types of hormone and/or chemotherapy [49]. One study compared hormone therapy with no hormone therapy in women with and with out chemotherapy, and 96 | the results showed that hormone therapy had no significant effect on fatigue, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in the two years following diagnosis [50]. Galalae et al [51] found that women who received radiotherapy and chemotherapy had worse QOL than women who received radiotherapy and hormone therapy, but there were no significant differences with the group of women that received radiotherapy alone. A possible reason for this positive effect of hormone therapy may be that wo men feel safer and worry less about possible metastases or recurrences because they are still under active treatment for their disease. There is some evidence that making the step fr om active treatment to being a cancer survivor can cause a decrease in QOL if guidance is not available [52]. However, given the small amount of literature on this topic, there is a need for more research . Another factor that could potentially have a role in the effect of hormone therapy is the discontinuation rate of hormone therapy. According to recent research, probably about 20% of the patients discontinue the use of Tamoxifen or other ho rmone medication after one year, and this number can reach almost 30% after two years [53, 54]. In our study, data on whether or not a patient received hormone therapy was retrieved from the medical record of the patient. We could not trace what percentage of the women that were on hormone therapy according to the medical record actually took their medic ation. This information should be taken into account when interpreting the results. The strength of the study is its prospectiv e, multicenter, and longitudinal design. One of the limitations is that part of the data was not (yet) available due to drop-out and the fact that some women were included in the study le ss than two years ago. Second, a high level of stress was an important reason for declining particip ation. Therefore, it is plausible that in the non-participant group, anxiety levels were higher than in the group that did participate, which can cause an underestimation of the level of an xiety at baseline. Third, no distinction was made between the different types of chemotherapy and hormone therapy. There is a possibility that different types of a certain t reatment can have different effects on outcome measures. In conclusion, about one in four women, who later receive the diagnosis BC, had elevated levels of state anxiety and depressive symptoms (CADS) just before diagnosis. As expected, this group of patients did worse than the other participants regarding state anxiety and depressive symptoms during the two years following primary surgery. CADS at baseline also emerged as a predictor of worse Physical and Psychological health, Overall QOL, and anxiety at 12 months after surgery, and for wo rse scores on all outcome measures, except Social relationships, at 24 months after surgery. This implies that women with a higher sco re on both state anxi ety and depressive symptoms should be identified as soon as poss ible in the process of diagnosis and treatment of BC using validated questionnaires or screenin g instruments. Only by identifying this group of patients, tailored psychological care can be offered. | 97 Acknowledgement We like to thank the collaborators of the Jero en Bosch hospital, Catharina hospital, St Elisabeth hospital, VieCuri Medical centre, Maas land Hospital, and Medical center Alkmaar for their contribution to the data collection of this study. 98 | References 1.

Chapter 7 Discussion 102 | Main findings of the study The aim of the systematic review described in chapter 2 was to examine the relationship between trait anxiety and psychological, physica l, and behavioral outcomes in breast cancer (BC) patients. The conclusion was that in the majority of the studies, higher trait anxiety played an important role in worse outcomes in BC patients on the psychological, physical and behavioral domain. In chapter 3 we discussed the psychometric properties of the WHOQOL-BREF in a population of women with breast problems. This study also examined whether these psychometric properties were different for co mpleting only the WHOQOL-BREF or deriving the scores of this questionnaire from the la rger WHOQOL-100. The WHOQOL-BREF appears to be a reliable instrument in a breast problem population. Construct validity was good, and so were test-retest reliability and sensitivity to change. When scores on the WHOQOL-BREF were derived from WHOQOL-100 data, th ey were comparable to scores obtained directly from the WHOQOL-BREF. The results in chapter 4 showed that women who scored high on trait anxiety had significantly worse outcomes on the health status (HS) scales Body image, Future perspective, Sexual functioning, and Side e ffects than women who did not sco re high on trait anxiety, even 12 months after surgical treatment. Furtherm ore, trait anxiety was the only significant predictor of Body image, Future perspective, Systemic therapy side-effects, and Sexual functioning at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Demographic and disease-related factors that appeared to be predictors of one or aspect s of HS were age, educational level, having children, having a partner, type of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy. Chapter 5 described the course of depressive symptoms, state anxiety, fatigue, and quality of life (QOL) in the two years after prim ary treatment. The role of a history of an anxiety disorder (HAD) on this course was studied. For the whole group, depressive symptoms, state anxiety, and fatigue deteriorated between 12 and 24 months after surgery. HAD was diagnosed in 15% of the patients. Pati ents with a HAD had worse scores on state anxiety, fatigue, physical, environmental QOL, and future perspective. Also, the relationship between having a HAD and patients' person ality characteristics and health care util ization were examined. The patients with a HAD scored higher on trait anxiety and neuroticism, but not on Type D personality, they were less lik ely to be treated with hormonal therapy and consulted their GP more often than patients wi thout a HAD. So, patients with HAD appeared to have worse outcomes compared with patients without HAD. In Chapter 6, the aim was to determine the relation ship between anxiety, depressive symptoms, combined anxiety and depressive sy mptoms (CADS), and personality with QOL, fatigue, and mood 12 and 24 months after su rgery. When BC patients had CADS before diagnosis their state anxiety score, depressive symptoms, and CADS scores were about three times as high 24 months after surgery as the sc ores of patients with out CADS at baseline. CADS also, more than state anxiety and depres sive symptoms alone, significantly predicted | 103 patients' QOL, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and state anxiety 12 and 24 months after surgery. Other important predictors of QOL, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and anxiety 12 and 24 months after surgery were neuroticism, receiving chemotherapy, and receiving hormone therapy. Anxiety The chapters 2, 4 , 5, and 6 of this thesis showed that anxiety is a significant factor in BC patients, both statistically and socially. By dividing BC patients in two groups, na mely high scorers on trait anxiety and not- high scorers on trait anxiety, we revealed the differences in how patien ts experience their life in the first year after their primary surgery. HS is seriously undermi ned by patients' tendency to react anxious to stressors and stressful events. This relationship between trait anxiety and HS measured by the EORTC QLQ-BR23 was not ye t studied by others, but similar results were found in three other studies, although in thes e studies the outcome measures were (health- related) QOL [1, 2] and psychological stress [3]. When people score high on trait anxiety th ey have a predisposition to experience anxiety disorders and higher levels of state anxiety in life [4]. This was also shown in chapter 5, where there was an association between having a HAD and scoring high on trait anxiety. When women with BC reported having a HAD, th is had a profound effect on the level of state anxiety, fatigue, Physical, and Environmental QOL in the two years after initial treatment. There was no previous research in BC patients , but studies in coronary [5, 6] and cancer patients [7-10] showed similar results. For BC patients with a HAD, future perspective decreased drastically between one and two years after surgery. This means that those women tended to become extremely wo rried about their health in th e future, from one year after initial treatment onwards. This deterioration of HS, state anxiety, fatigue, physical, and environmental QOL in women with high trait anxiety and a HAD respectively, could be explained by the fact that, usually, one year after initial treatment the adjuvant treatment and regular check-ups are ending, and the patien ts become uncertain about how to return to their \"normal\" li fe and how to deal with the fear of cancer recurrence [11, 12]. BC patients with HAD consulted their genera l practitioner more often than patients without HAD. A recent study [13] showed that patients with a genera lized anxiety disorder had more medical costs than primary care pati ents without a generaliz ed anxiety disorder. Another study on health care utilization in patien ts with breast problems [14] also showed that trait anxiety was a predictor for more GP consultations. These results support the assumption that anxiety influences medical consumption. Patients with HAD were also less likely to be treated with hormonal therapy than patients without HAD. This is hormonal treatmen t as indicated by the specialist at the start of the adjuvant treatment plan and not as (sel f-reported) hormonal medicine adherence. A direct relationship between anxiety disorders and prescribed hormonal treatment has not yet been studied, and presumably, there is a mediat ing or moderating factor that can add to the 104 | explanation of this relationship. We looked at two factors that could possibly account for the difference in hormonal treatment, namely st age of the disease at diagnosis and type of surgery, but our data showed no differences in those factors between women with HAD and women without HAD. A combination of elevated state anxiety and depressive symptoms, rather than state anxiety or depressive symptoms alone, emerged to be a predictor of worse state anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue and QOL at 12 and es pecially at 24 months after surgery. From earlier research there was evidence that there was a relationship between CADS and QOL [15, 16], but those studies were cross-sectional. The results of our study showed that a combination of factors at the time of diagnosi s can predict poor psychological well-being of women with BC, even up to two years after their diagnosis. Demographic and treatment related factors In chapter 4 , age was a predictor for Body image, Futu re perspective, and Sexual functioning. In chapter 6 , age predicted Psychological health. More specific, older patients had better Body image, Future perspectiv e, and Psychological health, and worse Sexual functioning. A possible explanation for these results could be that younger patients more often have an advanced disease stage at diagnosis or a tumor that has more aggressive characteristics. In these cases, treatment can be more invasive and mutilating, and more often includes chemotherapy, which is also a predictor for worse HS [17, 18] . An alternative explanation could be that a diagnosis of BC and the follo wing treatment has a more profound effect on the course of life in younger women than in older women [19-21]. The outcome that better sexual functioning was predicted by younger age was also found by other researchers [22, 23]. This result could be attributed to the fact that sexual functioning in older age is already worse at baseline [24]. There are also multiple studies that report a relationship between chemotherapy and worse sexual functioning, underlining that the detrimental effect of chemotherapy on sexual functioning is most present in younger women that end up in a premature menopause [25]. In accordance with previous studies [26-28], women who underwent breast conserving surgery (BCT) had a better Body image and overall QOL than women with a mastectomy (MTC). An unexpected result was that women with BCT reported more Breast symptoms than women with MTC, although MT C is medically more invasive than BCT. Patients with BCT almost always receive radiot herapy and the analyses showed that receiving radiotherapy also was a predictor for more breast symptoms. Since we know that radiotherapy causes irritation of the skin and makes wounds heal slower [29], this could be the reason for found result. Another possible explanation is a lingu istic one. In the questionnaire women are asked about complaints in the area of their affected breast. Perhaps, women with a MTC reason that they did not have a breast anymore (for MTC removes the breast in total) and therefore, do not report possible complaints as complaints of their breast. Another study [30] reported no differences in breast symptoms between BCT | 105 and MTC and apart from that study we could find no literature about this topic, so more research is needed to clarify this result. The study in chapter 4 showed that receiving chemothe rapy was a predictor of worse body image and sexual functioning, and more syst emic therapy side effects, as also reported in research by Browall et al. [31]. However, in chapter 6 , receiving chemotherapy predicted less fatigue at one year after initial surgery. We found no studies with the same result regarding the positive effect of receiving chemot herapy on fatigue. A possible explanation for this effect may be that women who received chemotherapy rate their fatigue according to their subjective situation, so they take the ph ysical and psychological consequences of this treatment into account. The questionnaires were completed a year after surgery, so also after completion of the chemotherapy treatment. So metimes this phenomenon is referred to as a response shift [32, 33]. Receiving hormone therap y generated even more surprising results in chapter 6 . It had a positive effect on Physical QOL, Envi ronmental QOL, overall QOL, and fatigue at 24 months after initial treatment. There are other studies that reported on hormone therapy and QOL, but most studies compared different ty pes of hormone therapy and/or chemotherapy [34]. There are two studies that studied the effe ct of hormone therapy on fatigue, anxiety, and depressive symptoms [35], and on QOL [3 6], but they both found that there were no differences between women with hormone therapy and women without hormone therapy. A possible explanation for the positive effect of hormone therapy that we found in our study, may be that women feel safer and worry less about possible metastases or recurrences because they are still under active treatment an d control for their disease. There is some evidence that making the step from active tr eatment to being a cancer survivor can cause a decrease in QOL if guidance is not available [ 11, 12]. Women experience this transition phase as highly distressing [37]. However, given the small amount of literature on this topic, there is a need for more research. Anothe r factor that could potentially have a role in the effect of hormone therapy is the discontinuation rate of hormone therapy. According to recent research, probably about 20% of the patients discontinue the use of Tamoxifen or other hormone medication after one year, and this number can reach almost 30% after two years [38, 39]. In our study, data on whether or not a patient received hormone therapy was retrieved from the medical record of the patien t. This does not provide information on the percentage of the women that ac tually took their medication. Implications for clinical practice Taking all the above information into account , the first inevitable implication is the implementation of screening on trait anxiety at the start of the process of diagnosis and treatment of breast problems, and ideally even before diagnosis. This way woman with a high risk to develop psychological, physical, or behavi oral complaints will be identified and can be monitored during the process. This can be done with short, validated, and easy to administer anxiety questionnaires, such as the (short versio n of the) STAI [40, 41] . Only by identifying 106 | women high on anxiety it will become possible to offer tailored psychological care to those patients, thereby preventing psychological, physi cal, and behavioral prob lems. An additional advantage of preventing these problems is th e reduction of health care costs, since women high on anxiety tend to use the health care system more often ( chapter 5 ). Another implication of this thesis concer ns the moment that the active treatment phase ends. Doctors and other health care prof essionals may think that patients are relieved when they finish treatment and medication, but some of our results suggest that women experience this transition phase as highly distre ssing. This is in line with the scarce literature on this topic [11, 12, 37]. Patients feel they are supposed to continue their life as before the diagnosis, but may experience uncertainty and co mplaints from the disease and its treatment. The need for a personal care plan for these canc er survivors is obvious, and there should be more attention for this phase in the treatment of cancer. Finally, health care providers should not assume that women with BCT do better than women with MTC. Nowadays, BCT seems to be the golden standard in BC surgery, but the results from this study pointed out that ev en though BCT is medically speaking a less invasive treatment than MTC, BCT patients can have serious breast symptoms. Earlier research also showed that overall QOL in wome n with MTC is comparable with that in women with BCT [42, 43]. Health care providers should, therefore, be aware of the fact that BCT is not necessarily a guarantee for less medi cal and psychosocial complaints. Implications for future research First of all, the results from the studies in chapters 5 and 6 make the need for research on the transition phase from active treatment to cancer survivor evident. Little is known about the psychological state of women who are in this ph ase of treatment, but the signs are indicating that there can be gained a lot by offering th e appropriate treatment, counseling, and follow- up to subgroups of patients. In this research, the effect of hormone treatment on outcomes should also be stressed, taking the adherence to hormone therapy into account. The results in this thesis showed that there are effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy on outcome measures. This were secondary outcomes, but it would be interesting to do more resear ch on these different (neo-adjuvant) treatment modalities, and combinations of the different th erapies, to make the expertise on this topic more profound. With a more extensive patient population and a longer follow-up, more will become known about patient-reported outcom es, which includes QOL, HS, depressive symptoms, state anxiety, and fatigue, and he alth care utilization on the long term. Finally, future studies should examine the effects (psychological, physical, medical, behavioral, and financial) of a psychosocial scr eening instrument that is implemented as early as possible in the process of diagnosis and t reatment of breast problems, and ideally even before diagnosis. Next to that, the referral rate of the mentioned screening instrument should be evaluated, and the effect of psychological counseling in women with BC or benign breast | 107 disease should be investigated. Some studies on this topic already started, and the, hopefully interesting results, can be ex pected in the near future. Limitations Some limitations of this study should be mentioned. This study was embedded in daily hospital practice. Nurse practitioners approached patients to participate in the study, and the administration of non-responders was an additi onal task next to the busy daily schedule they already had. As a consequence, they did not ad ministrate all non-responders and we did not have a very clear picture of the patients that did not want to participate in the study. What we do know, is that a high leve l of stress was an important reas on for declining participation. Presumably, the anxiety levels in the non-participant group were higher than in the group that did participate, which could have led to an underestimation of the level of anxiety at baseline. Furthermore, although the sample was qui te substantial, at times there were not enough participants to perform certain subgroup analyses, for example on different treatment groups such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, and the combinations of those treatment modalities. Fo r this same reason, no distinction was made between the different types of chemotherapy and hormone therapy. There is a possibility that different types of a cert ain treatment can have differen t effects on outcome measures, but more patients should be includ ed to study these differences. In chapter 4 , only early stage BC patients were included, so it is not possible to generalize the results to BC patients in general. However, the analyses in chapter 5 and 6 included BC patients in all stages at diagnosis. 108 | References 1.
