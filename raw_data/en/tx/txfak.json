Seniors' Secretariat 1740 Granville Street 4th Floor, P .O. Box 2065Halifax, Nova ScotiaB3J 2Z1902-424-0065 (T) 1-800-670-0065902-424-0561 (F)scs@gov.ns.cawww.gov.ns.ca/scs3The Future is in our Hands We all Own the Strategy forPositive Aging By Nancy Radcliffe, Task Force on Aging \"The future is literally in our hands to mold as we like. But we cannot wait until tomorrow. Tomorrow is now.\" Eleanor Roosevelt's words are important to remember as we prepare for an aging population. The Strategy for Positive Aging in Nova Scotia will serve as a guide for molding our province's future and fortaking actions that cannot wait until tomorrow.The official launch of the Strategy will be held inNovember 2005. In our hands Over the past year, all levels of government, organizations, and individuals have worked with the Task Force on Aging to develop the Strategy.In fact, more than 1,000 people - most of themseniors - shared their insights and ideas throughwritten responses to the Discussion Paper for Positive Aging , and by participating in 34 public meetings and 12 stakeholder forums. Their dedicationtomaking sure Nova Scotia values and supports seniors is reflected in the Strategy . The Strategy is more than a framework for government action\u2014it is a guide for helping every sector ofsociety be better prepared for the impact of an agingpopulation. Likewise, the success of the Strategy willdepend on the ability of all sectors to work together-constructively and creatively. Henry Ford once said: \"If I had asked the people what they wanted, theywould have said faster horses.\" The Task Force onAging asked Nova Scotians what they wanted.Admittedly, some of them suggested the equivalentof \"faster horses.\" But a great many more said weneed new and better ways of doing things, becauseincreasing demands will make many of our currentprograms unsustainable. Solutions to meeting theneeds of seniors today and in the future are not found in convenient thinking, they are found in ourcollective creativity. Molding the future Each month, 700 Nova Scotians celebrate their 65th birthday. Based on the percentage of the populationover 65, Nova Scotia is currently the oldest provincein Atlantic Canada and is the third-oldest in thecountry. Nova Scotia's population of seniors(132,600) is expected to nearly double by 2026.In fact, the population in six Nova Scotia towns isalready more than 25 per cent seniors. The reality of an aging population brings many challenges,but it also brings tremendous opportunities.Maximizing these opportunities is the best way to overcome the challenges . The Strategy identifies a vision of Nova Scotia as \"an inclusive society of caring communities that supports the well being of seniors and values theircontributions .\" It defines nine targeted goals that are needed to achieve this vision. And it describes the societal actions that are needed to achieve each of the goals . The Strategy will also provide background and research to help everyoneunderstand the broader impact of future decisions . And it will highlight some innovative ideas that have been successfully implemented here and in other parts of the world. Tomorrow is now At the heart of the Strategy is the belief that the actions we take today must, wherever possible, helpus prepare for tomorrow. At every opportunity, inevery planning activity we undertake, Nova Scotiansneed to think about what needs to be done to makesure our communities are ready to meet the needs of the rapidly increasing senior population. Somechanges are large , others are small. In some cases we face the significant challenge of shiftingattitudes, in others it's simply a matter of makingminor adjustments . Indeed, by encouraging Nova Scotians to talk about our aging population, the Task4Force has already witnessed the ripple effect that increased awareness is having on planning andpolicies that impact seniors. Like a tiny pebble on asmooth pond, we have seen how sharing good ideasand developing senior-friendly practices improves lives. The Strategy recommends that everyone\u2014 governments at all levels, businesses, not-for-profitorganizations, community and faith groups, andindividuals\u2014think about what they can do to makeaging in Nova Scotia a more positive experience.As we launch the Strategy, it is important to beexcited about how far we have come, but also toremember that the this is only the beginning. The nextstep is to develop detailed action plans. Again, allsectors\u2014 not just government\u2014are urged to usethe Strategy as a guide for planning. The responsibilityfor implementing the actions rests with a variety ofdifferent groups and individuals. In some cases, theresponsibility rests with all of us . Just as the Strategy belongs to Nova Scotians, so does its implementation. Acopy of the Strategy will be mailed to the people who attended public and stak eholder meetings .For anyone who w as unable to attend, but would like to receive a copy ,please call 1-800-670-0065 (toll free) or424-0065 in Metro . Update on Seniors for Literacy Pr oject By Marguerite McMillan, Project Coordinator, Nova Scotia Seniors for Literacy Committee In our last newsletter, I reported on the literacy workshops that were held for seniors in threecommunities last F all.Following that report, Iwas invited to do a presentation about the workshops at a Tutor Learner Conference in Digby this past May . Some thirty tutors from that part of the province attended the session and learned w ays to remove barriers faced by older learners and how to attractthem to literacy programs. They were also introduced to the new literacy resources kit for seniors andviewed \"Never too Old to Learn\", a video preparedby the University of Regina. The feedback fromtutors was positive and many said they were notaware that so many seniors struggle to read. The struggle to read affects everything from being able to read the mail, completing forms and cheques,reading food and medication labels, to findinginformation on staying healthy. The term HealthLiteracy has been getting a lot of attention lately,and studies are showing that lack of literacy skills is often associated with poor health among seniorsand the inability to manage their health. The termHealth Literacy is defined by Healthy People 2010 as \"the degree to which people are able to get,process, and understand basic health informationand services needed to make appropriate healthdecisions\". With this in mind, the committee applied for funding from the National LiteracySecretariat, aprogram of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada to develop a healthliteracy manual specifically designed for older adults .Weare pleased to report that the funding was approved for the project to begin this F all. The goal is to have the manual available for use in our province ,but it will be designed so that it can be adapted to other jurisdictions. Seniors' Literacy and Learning Initiative The other good news is that we have just learned that the Nova Scotia Department of Education and theSeniors' Secretariat are partnering in a joint investmentfor seniors' literacy and learning programs. The Seniors' Secretariat and Department of Education each invested $20,000 to help build literacy andlearning programs for seniors in communities acrossthe province . Through the Seniors' Literacy and Learning Initiative, Community Learning Networkscan apply for grants of up to $3,000 to implementsenior -friendly literacy programs in their community. 5For more information on the Seniors' Literacy and Learning Initiative or the Seniors for Literacy Project,please feel free to contact me at the Secretariat byphone at 424-5329 or 1-800-670-0065 , or via e-mail at mcmillma@gov.ns.ca . Elder Abuse By Barb Baker, Elder Abuse Consultant Towards Awareness and Prevention of Elder Abuse Has your neighbour mentioned that her nephew only visits when her pension cheques come? Does the explanation about your father' sbruises given to you by the nursing home care attendant sound suspicious? Has your mother stopped talking withyou as frequently since she moved in with her newpartner? These situations may indicate elder abuse. How can you find out? Are there services available in your community to assist? What can you do? Understanding and recognizing the signs of abuse when you suspect an older adult is being treatedimproperly can provide you with the confidence and ability to be able to help prevent and stop theabuse from happening. The Seniors' Secretariat iscommitted to addressing the issue of elder abuseand has been leading the implementation of theGovernment of Nova Scotia's five-year elder abusestrategy. With guidance from the Elder AbusePrevention Strategy Committee and its two workinggroups, priorities for action have been identified.The strategy emphasizes the importance of educationand raising awareness in battling elder abuse andencouraging people to speak up about it. In November 2005, the NS Elder Abuse Strategy: Towards Awareness and Prevention will be shared with stakeholders across the province, identifyingpriorities and establishing the framework within whichefforts to prevent the abuse of older Nov aScotians will occur over the next several years. Initial Actions and Future Actions will guide government, community partners ,communities ,and individuals in promoting the health and well-being of older Nov aScotians through the prevention of abuse . The Secretariat is also busy exploring the role of community-based networks in the prevention of elder abuse; developing information on elder abuse for the Secretariat's website (as well as other informational materials); and planning an Elder Abuse Awareness Day to be held on November 2. To learn more about the work the Secretariat is doing related to elder abuse or to share informationor a story, please contact Jane e-mail: at 1-800-670-0065 . The Honourable Angus McIsaac, Chair jointly announced a $40,000 investmentto suppor tliteracy and learning for seniors with the Department of Education at the fall consultation,held on October 11. He is seen here with CarolBoudreau, facilitator of the Kings County project,looking over the book her group created. 6If you suspect a senior is being abused, don't ignore the signs. Discuss the situation with the individualand suggest counselling, resources, and supportservices. Get outside help, if needed, from socialservices, legal services, or police. If the situationis an emergency, call 911. If you know of a senior in need of protection, call Adult Protection Services, Nova Scotia Department of Health at 1-800-225-7225 . YOUR HEALTH Flu Season Cometh Be Prepared Influenza is caused by influenza Aand B viruses and occurs in Canada every year, usually during thelate fall and winter months. The usual symptoms of influenza are sudden onset of fever ,chills , cough, sore throat, sore muscles and joints, headache and tiredness. Influenza can cause severe illness and evendeath, especially in people over age 65 and those with chronic illness . Every year in Nova Scotia over 2500 hospitalizations and over 400 deaths are theresult of influenza infection. Influenza vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza and its complications. Since influenza viruseschange themselves from year to year vaccinationneeds to be repeated every fall. In Nova Scotia thevaccine is available at no cost to people consideredto be at higher risk of getting severely ill frominfluenza. Those at 'high-risk' include: people 65 years of age or over people who live in nursing homes and other chronic care facilities. adults and children with chronic lung or heart diseases, diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, HIV,immune deficiency ,anemia children and adolescents treated for long periods of time with aspirin house hold contacts of the above groups children age 6 to 23 months of age health care workers (including volunteers in hospitals, long term care facilities and home care organizations) The only people who should not receive influenza vaccine are people who have severe or anaphylacticallergies to eggs or who have had a severe allergicreaction to a previous dose of influenza vaccine. Every fall, starting in mid-October, influenza vaccine is available at family doctor's offices and communityclinics . Watch your local newspaper and listen to your local radio and TV for the provincial \"Flu Launch\" date and the times and locations of local clinics.Although October and November are the bestmonths to get influenza v accine , if you miss these times it is still important to be immunized during the early winter before the influenza season arrives . It is also important to remember that if you are in one of the \"high-risk\" groups there should be no cost at all for you to get influenza v accine at your doctor's office or Public Health clinic. Along with having \"high-risk\" people immunized, prevention of influenza in \"high-risk\" people also requires steps to reduce their exposure to influenzaviruses. The main way to reduce the exposure of high-risk individuals is to immunize their closecontacts\u2014household members and care givers . If household members and care providers are not immunized against influenza then they are putting\"high-risk\" people at increased risk of influenza and its complications. Take the initiative and ask household members, as well those who provide care to you(whether it is in your home ,at an office or in a facility) \"have you had your flu shot?\" If you are a care-provider or volunteer to \"high-risk\" people in their own homes or in a care facility it isyour responsibility to be immunized to protect them. 7Don't take the risk of bringing the \"flu bug\" to those you are trying to help. There are many myths about influenza vaccine but in reality it is a very safe and well-tolerated vaccine. Can influenza vaccine give people influenza? No, the manufacturing process kills the virus particles in flu vaccine, so the vaccine cannot cause an influenza infection. Igot influenza vaccine last year and still got influenza symptoms. How? Possible explanations for getting influenza-like illness despite being vaccinated are: 1. Many other viruses give people flu-like symptoms. Influenza v accine does not prevent these other illnesses; it only protects you against trueinfluenza. The influenza-like symptoms areprobably due to infection by another virus. 2. The vaccine did not give full protection and the person got true influenza. This will happen to afew people ,but without v accination the illness would probably be much more severe. Is it true that the side effects of influenza vaccine are worse than the flu? No. The benefits of influenza vaccine far outweigh any risks, especially for people at high risk of gettingsevere influenza and its complications . Most people experience few or no side effects. After a flu shot, some patients may be more likely to blame thesymptoms of another illness on the v accine. Taking acetaminophen shortly after your flu shot may decrease the frequency of side effects such as redness, pain and swelling at the injection site. If you do experience the rare flu-like side-effects, they will usually disappear in 24-48 hours, while the flucan last for 10 days or more and may leave you feelingunwell even longer. Also, a true case of influenzaalways leaves the possibility of complications, suchas pneumonia, and even death.If you are 65 years of age or older, or in one of the other \"high-risk\" categories, then the best way toprotect yourself from influenza is to have yourself,and your close contacts [household members andcare givers], immunized every fall. The following general steps will help you avoid influenza and the many other viruses that arearound every fall and winter. Wash your hands frequently with hot water and soap Avoid close contact with people who are coughing and sneezing Eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly and get enough sleep. This helps your body to fight off infections Reprinted with permission from: Dr. Robert Strang, Medical Officer of Health for the Capital Health District DIN, NPN, DIN-HM: What They Mean and Why It Matters If you look closely at a bottle of vitamins, you should see an eight digit numerical code preceded by one ofthe following three abbreviations: \"DIN\", \"NPN\" or\"DIN-HM\". The eight digit numerical code is assigned by Health Canada when the product is approved for sale in Canada. The abbreviation that precedes thenumber indicates the type of product: \" DIN\"stands for drug identification number. Products with \"DIN\" on their label are drugs that have been approved to be mark eted in accordance with the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations . \"NPN \" stands for natural product number . Products with \"NPN\" on their label are natural health products that have been approved to be marketed under the Natural Health Products Regulations . 8\"DIN-HM \" stands for homeopathic medicine . Products with \"DIN-HM\" on their label are homeopathicmedicines that have been approved to be marketedunder the Natural Health Products Regulations . The importance of looking for this abbreviation with the eight digit numerical code is because it lets you knowthat the product has been reviewed by Health Canadafor safety, quality and health claims. On small containers,the abbreviation and number may be so small that youwill have to ask your pharmacist to point it out! While it is always good to look for this abbreviation and number when you are selecting a nonprescriptionhealth product, don't expect to find it on all health-related products. Some products, like blood glucosetest strips and bandages, are not drugs, naturalhealth products or homeopathic medicines . They are health-related supplies and they go though a different approval process in Canada. Reprinted with permission from: Dawn Frail, Manager of Drug Technology Assessment, Department of Health Pharmacare Reimbursement Health Minister Angus MacIsaac announced on October 5 that Nova Scotia seniors who receive the Guaranteed Income Supplement and have paid aPharmacare premium will be fully reimbursed. \"The agreement has just been signed with Medavie Blue Cross to start processing back payments foreligible Nova Scotians,\" said Mr. MacIsaac. Premiums were introduced in the provincial Pharmacare Program in 1996. The full 2005-06 premium is $390 peryear. The premium is either reduced or waived for abouthalf of the 95,000 seniors enrolled in the program. The premium is not the same as the co-payment. All program participants, regardless of the premium theypay, still pay a co-payment amount. The co-payment is33 per cent, to a maximum of $30 per prescription,capped at $350 annually.Since the spring, eligible Nova Scotians who have come forward have been reimbursed for premiumspaid in the current and last fiscal years. The policyhas now been changed to allow for reimbursementsfor payments made since 1996. Cheques will begin to be mailed through the Pharmacare Program within three to four weeks to individuals who have already come forward. The province will begin an information campaign in the coming weeks to notify pharmacists, health-careproviders, seniors, and their family members. As well,revised literature, which highlights this benefit moreclearly, is now being used by the Pharmacare Program. Those with questions about their situation should contact the seniors Pharmacare Program.It is important that individuals only call if theyreceive the Guaranteed Income Supplement andhave paid a Pharmacare premium in the past.This does not include the co-payment.

Remember, your Medication Record booklet is only useful if it is up-to-date and if it is used properly.Help for Depression The Department of Health is reaching out to seniors who may be suffering from depression. It is estimated nine per cent of all Nova Scotians report being depressed at some point but many of those people won't seek help. As part of the a three-year campaign to increase awareness of mental illness, the government istrying to raise awareness through a campaign that urges people to reach out for help if they are at risk for depression. \"We know that, among seniors, retirement, the loss of a spouse, or medical problems can cause peopleto become depressed. It's important they discuss this with their doctor so they can start feeling well again,\"said Linda Judge, senior co-ordinator of mental healthwith the Department of Health. Many people live with the symptoms for years without even knowing it. Some of the common signs are: Irritability and/or depressed mood nearly every day for weeks or months Loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy Low energy Poor concentration Feeling sad or anxiousFeel that life is hopeless or empty Have chest pains or stomach problems Posters will soon go out to all nursing homes , home support agencies and senior community centres.

Scam artists take advantage of thousandsof Canadians each year who are educated, informed,and involved in the community. Their techniques areup-to-date and include telemark eting, door-to-door canvassing, door-to-door salespeople, and onlineoffers. A scammer could be a stranger, but can alsobesomeone you are close to. While most scammers are highly informed and regularly update their scamming methods, there are some tipsyou can follow to avoid being tak en advantage of by ascammer: Never agree to send someone money so that you can win a prize . Be careful about paying for products you have not seen. Don't pay someone up front to recover money for you. Don't give in to pressure from a salesperson. If the deal is legitimate, they will wait. Ask for all offers in writing as well as a call back number, and references. Don't be afraid to ask questions and make sure your questions are answered. If you don't understand the offer, do not buy anything. Before making major financial decisions such as making investments, loaning money, or changingthe ownership of your assets, get a second opinionfrom your spouse, a trusted friend, a lawyer oryour financial advisor.

Preparing for an Emergency As hurricane season is upon us and winter is fast approaching, it is important to take steps to ensurethat you are as prepared as possible for a weatheremergency .Hurricane Juan and White Juan demonstrated that Nov aScotians must be prepared for emergencies that arise from abnormal weather patterns. Suggestions to help you prepare for an emergency: 1. Find out what types of storms normally hit your area.2. Pay attention to storm warnings.3. Plan for what you will do if the power goes out, if there is no water, or if you have to evacuate your home . 4. Arrange with a friend or neighbour to check on you and help you if needed. 5. Develop a survival kit including non-perishable foods , bottled water, candles and waterproof matches. When preparing your kit, keep in mind any special needs of pets . 126. Have a battery-operated radio so you can listen for updates as to what is going on. 7. If your TTY plugs in, have another way to get information, such as text messaging.(TTYs are communication devices used by thehearing impaired) 8. If you need power for medical reasons, such as a ventilator or medication that needs to berefrigerated, register with Nova Scotia Power'scritical consumer list.

Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol for at least six to eight hours before going to bed. Caffeineand nicotine are stimulants and can causenightmares. Alcohol may have a sedating effect,but it actually disrupts sleep. 3. Don't eat or drink too much of anything close to bedtime. 4. Pick the right time to exercise. A brisk workout within three hours of going to bed mak es it harder to fall asleep. Our body temperatures rise during exercise, and it may take up to sixhours to drop. Lower body temperature signals the brain that it's time to sleep. Many sleepexperts recommend late afternoon as the perfecttime to exercise. 5. If you don't fall asleep within 15 to 20 minutes, get out of bed and listen to soft music or readuntil you feel sleepy. Don't use this as time tosolve problems. 6. Use your bed for sleeping. Take everything else (worrying, planning, office work) somewhereelse. The sleep environment should signal nothingbut sleep. 7. Make sure your bedroom is cool, dark, quiet, and as free from interruptions as possible. Earplugs,eye shades, and \"white noise\" machines can contribute to a better sleep environment. 8.Arelaxing ritual just before bedtime ,likeahot bath or a cup of w arm milk, will also give your body the signal that it' stime for sleep .
