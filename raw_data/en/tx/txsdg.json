Read on to find out how it's more relevant than ever! What Is Chinese Medicine? Chinese Medicine works to restore balance and harmony in our bodies through a system of holistic health care. Its core principles are based on Yin and Yang, and the concept of Qi, which may also be described as energy. When Qi flows freely in the body, this results in health, but when it becomes stagnant or stuck, deficient or flows in the wrong direction, it can lead to disease. In Chinese Medicine, the body, mind, spirit and emotions are all interconnected and must work harmoniously with each other in order to promote wellness. It is believed that in following the laws of nature and using natural elements such as herbs, both harmony and health can be achieved. While this may seem intangible, Chinese Medicine has developed over the years in response to modern medicine. Research now backs up every aspect of its use, as well as modern medical diagnostic techniques. Chinese Medicine broadly describes practices that have been revered across both China and other parts of southeast Asia. It has proven clinical effectiveness and has therefore influenced modern medicine all over the world in diagnosing, treating, and preventing illness. How is Chinese Medicine Used? Chinese Medicine involves acupuncture, moxibustion, herbal medicine, dietary and exercise therapy. Traditional medicine uses plants, animal parts, minerals and more. Lifestyle management is also a big factor involved in Chinese Medicine, in order to prevent problems before they occur. You have probably heard of Chinese Herbal Medicine. It is very popular, as is acupuncture, moxa therapy, breathing exercises and movement, such as tai chi.
