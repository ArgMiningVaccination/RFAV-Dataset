I write in support of LD867. Cornell College closed its doors last month to in-person learning after 900+ students tested positive for COVID-19 in a six-day period. Cornell College had a vaccination mandate for staff and students. It was reported that 97% of the staff and student body were fully vaccinated at the time of the outbreak. More than 70 colleges across 26 states are starting the 2022 term online due to COVID-19 outbreaks. Many of these colleges have vaccine mandates for their students and staff. On Thursday, Jan 6th, WGME 13 reported: \"Maine is seeing a surge in the number of healthcare workers who are calling out due to COVID-19. On Wednesday alone, more than 1,300 hospital workers were not able to come in to work. Of those 1,300, 842 workers with MaineHealth, the state's largest health care system, were absent due to COVID-19. Another 493 Northern Light Health employees were out because they tested positive or were in quarantine waiting for results.\"MaineHealth and Northern Light Health employees are all under the COVID19 vaccine mandate issued by Governor Mills. During an interview with CNN's Wolf Blizter last summer, the US CDC director Rochelle Walensky confirmed what most of us here already know. She said, \"What these vaccines can't do anymore is prevent transmission.\" In my humble opinion, vaccine mandates put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19 do not make sense if vaccination does not stop the transmission of this virus. This is especially true in the case of our youth- a group that stands to lose the most from unforeseen consequences of a novel treatment with no long term testing and a group that the US CDC claims to be at low risk for serious complications due to COVID-19. I have a number of friends and colleagues who have left the healthcare and first responder professions in Maine after Governor Mills' COVID-19 vaccine mandate went into effect. Many left their jobs or were fired because they did not want to subject themselves to a novel vaccine with zero long-term safety testing. If the COVID-19 mandates were to come to my family, to my children, we would also leave the state. The people of my community would have to travel further for chiropractic care. It is important to understand how these mandates are negatively impacting the access to healthcare in our communities. Once again, I respectfully ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD867. This bill would allow for more testing on COVID-19 vaccines before forcing them onto a population that cannot give true informed consent with the data that is currently available. Thank you for listening. Dr. Blake Rosso, "}
