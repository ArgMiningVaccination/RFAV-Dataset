How many times have you woken up with your face puffed up and swollen? Quite often, right? Facial swelling is a common condition caused by a plethora of factors such as lack of sleep, excess alcohol, and stress. Sometimes, it can also be a result of an injury or an underlying medical condition. The good news is you can treat your facial swelling once you know the root cause. So, let us explore the different causes of facial swelling as well as how to reduce face swelling with some simple home remedies. In This Article What Is Facial Swelling? Facial swelling is described as the enlargement of the face either due to inflammation of facial tissues or due to fluid buildup. Also known as facial edema, swelling commonly occurs on the lips, cheeks, and eyelids. Sometimes it may extend to the throat or neck region as well. There are a variety of factors that may cause your face to swell up. Hop onto the next section to look at them in detail. What Causes Facial Swelling? Facial swelling occurs in reaction to an injury or an invasion by a foreign substance. When your body is exposed to a foreign substance or a trauma, it releases chemicals to protect the face. As a result, your inflammatory cells become activated and your face swells up. The following are some of the common reasons behind facial swelling: 1. Lifestyle Waking up with a swollen face is quite common due to retention of fluid overnight. Other than that, facial swelling can be a result of alcohol, smoking, sleeping position, and lack of sleep ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6715121/)), ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3738045/)). If you wake up with a swollen face after partying the previous night, you can blame it on the alcohol! 2 Allergic Reaction Medications, food, pollen, bees, insects, or mold may cause allergic reactions that can lead to facial swelling and even anaphylactic shocki [X]An acute allergic reaction caused by intolerance to an allergen that results in shortness of breath, hypotension, and fainting. in some people ( [3](http://www.jsirjournal.com/Vol2Issue1013.pdf)). A [survey](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2720064) conducted on 40,443 US adults found that 10.8% of Americans had a food allergy, while nearly 19% self-reported a food allergy. It was further seen that 50% had experienced a food allergy as an adult, while over 38% had gone to the emergency room for a food allergy-related issue at least once in their lifetime. Along with a swollen face, you may develop the following symptoms. - Itchy nose or throat - Sneezing - Coughing - Red eyes - Runny nose 3 . Facial Trauma Or Injury Sustaining an injury to the face can result in swelling, bruising, pain, and nosebleed.

This is a serious condition and requires immediate medical attention ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441981/)). 6. Tooth Infection An infection in the gum or tooth can cause your jawline to swell. Poor oral hygiene breaks down the enameli [X]The white crystalline outermost layer of a tooth made of calcium phosphate that insulates it against injuries. and allows the bacteria to enter and infect the tooth, leading to facial swelling ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493149/)). 7. Facial Cellulitis Facial cellulitis is a skin infection caused by staphylococcus or streptococcus bacteria when it enters the body through a break in the skin's surface, leading to skin discoloration, pain, and facial swelling ( [7](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340819785_Odontogenic_Facial_Cellulitis_in_Children_Review_Article)).
