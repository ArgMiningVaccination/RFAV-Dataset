Add/delete rows as necessary.) |INSTITUTION AND LOCATION||DEGREE PERSONAL STATEMENT During the past 35+ years, most of the work in the laboratory has been concerned with the neurobiology of quinolinate (QUIN) and kynurenate (KYNA), two neuroexcitatory (and excitotoxic) and neuroinhibitory (and neuroprotective) properties, respectively. Both QUIN and KYNA are products of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation. Using a combination of biochemical, histological, behavioral and electrophysiological techniques, we have elaborated many of the characteristics and control mechanisms which govern the function of QUIN and KYNA in the brain. Ongoing in vivo and in vitro studies are designed 1) to identify possible abnormalities in kynurenine pathway metabolism in major neurological and psychiatric diseases, and in relevant animal models; 2) to further define the neurobiology of QUIN and KYNA in animals by manipulating the kynurenine pathway pharmacologically and genetically; and 3) to develop and use novel kynurenergic drugs in order to normalize functional impairments in the central nervous system. My laboratory currently consists of 8 team members (senior/postdoctoral scientists, students and research assistants), who focus mainly on work with experimental animals and on studies with clinical samples provided by investigators at my own institution and by selected external collaborators.

Contributions to science 1. During my postdoctoral period, first under the mentorship of Dr. Joseph Coyle (Johns Hopkins University), then with Drs. Kjell Fuxe and Tomas H\u00f6kfelt (Karolinska Institute), I was concerned mainly with the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie nerve cell death in the central nervous system. I showed that an intrastriatal injection of the excitatory amino acid kainate provides a faithful animal model for the neurodegenerative disorder Huntington's Disease. In Stockholm, I discovered that ibotenic acid, another excitatory amino acid receptor agonist, duplicates the selective toxic effects of kainate in the striatum. Compared to kainate, however, ibotenate turned out to be a superior experimental lesioning tool, which is being used to this day in neuroscience laboratories throughout the world. These studies with kainate and ibotenate led to the idea, widely confirmed and echoed during the past 35+ years, that \"excitotoxic\" processes, triggered by an overstimulation of excitatory amino acid receptors, are causally involved in the pathophysiology of several major neurological diseases. a.

Oct ;37(2):199-216. PubMed PMID: 40808. 2. In the early 1980s, at the beginning of my career as an independent investigator, I developed the concept that antagonists of excitatory amino acid (\"glutamate\") receptors ought to prevent or arrest neurodegeneration and may thus hold promise as novel therapeutic agents for catastrophic brain diseases. I verified this idea in several relevant neurological disease models. In the following years, this breakthrough discovery led to the establishment of anti-excitotoxin-based drug development programs in most major pharmaceutical companies. a.

Based on my hypothesis that endogenous excitotoxins may play a role in the pathophysiology of human brain disorders, I discovered, in 1983, that the tryptophan metabolite quinolinic acid (QUIN) triggers specific neurodegenerative events in the mammalian brain. I subsequently identified QUIN as a regular constituent of the human brain, described and characterized its metabolic enzymes in the brain and found, unexpectedly, that the metabolite was produced in, and released from, glial cells rather than neurons. This led me to propose in the 1980s, i.e. at a time when glial cells were still considered \"brain glue\" or at best suppliers of nutrition and energy to neurons, that glia-derived QUIN, by targeting glutamate receptors on nerve cells, may play an important role in neuronal function and dysfunction. My interest in the neurobiology of QUIN then prompted me to investigate the effects of a related tryptophan metabolite, kynurenic acid (KYNA). I first showed that KYNA exists normally in the mammalian brain and possesses pronounced neuroprotective and anticonvulsant properties. I then demonstrated that KYNA's biosynthetic enzymes in the brain reside preferentially in astrocytes. Further characterization of KYNA metabolism revealed that one of these enzymes, which we named kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) II, singularly controls the function of neuroactive KYNA. a.

Using both genetic approaches and new pharmacological tools designed together with my postdocs, students and collaborators nationally and internationally, I went on to show that selective attenuation of KATII activity has profound effects on the fate and function of the classic neurotransmitters glutamate, dopamine, acetylcholine and - as shown more recently - GABA. Originating from astrocytes, KYNA is therefore a new, chemical messenger with unique neuromodulatory properties. This insight led me and others to propose a role of (fluctuations in) astrocyte-derived KYNA in the control of physiological processes ranging from neurotransmitter release and mechanisms involved in synapse formation and neuronal plasticity to motor and cognitive behaviors. Validation of this concept, in several cases using specific KAT II inhibitors first tested in my laboratory, has now been provided by distinguished scientists worldwide. a.

During the past 15 years, it became clear that drugs which are able to normalize the balance between QUIN and KYNA in the brain hold great promise for the treatment of major human brain diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depressive disorders, schizophrenia and drug abuse. Depending on the nature of the underlying disease process, QUIN synthesis inhibitors or KATII inhibitors are currently considered prime candidates for clinical interventions. Our recent papers, as well as studies by other investigators in both academia and industry, attest to the feasibility of This new approach and have provided impressive proof-of-concept data in relevant disease models. a.
