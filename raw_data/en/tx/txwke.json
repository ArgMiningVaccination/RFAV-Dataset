And at some point, your furry friend will inevitably gravitate towards plants and flowers for a bite or two. As beautiful as these colorful blooms are, some household plants and garden flowers can be particularly dangerous to our tail-wagging companions. Of course, fragrant varieties are especially tempting (and, yes, even deadly), but did you know that your pet simply drinking water from a vase containing poisonous cut flowers can result in vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, lethargy, and lack of appetite? As you will see on this list, sometimes the potency is wrapped in the leaves, whereas in other cases, it could be in the seeds or bulbs. You can always take extra precautions by placing your indoor containers in inaccessible areas of your home. But, the best (and most obvious) form of recourse is to avoid buying and planting toxic plants altogether, especially if your dog or cat is known for roaming around outside and nibbling on anything out of sheer curiosity. And if you can't possibly part way with your precious wisteria and tulips this season, fencing around your flowers is another viable alternative. Although you can't do anything about the neighbors' gardens, you can protect your pup by starting in your own backyard. According to the ASPCA, these are the safest plants to thrill, fill, and spill, as well as the ones to avoid. Barbara Rich/Getty Images Perennials That Are Toxic To Pets Aloe vera - For humans, aloe vera works wonders for the skin and for burns. For dogs and cats, not so much. Symptoms from eating include vomiting, diarrhea, and tremors. Carnation/Sweet William - They're not as harmful as other perennials, but they can cause mild gastrointestinal problems for your beloved pet. Chrysanthemum - Consuming any part of this autumn bloom can cause gastrointestinal issues and loss of coordination for your four-legged friend. Dahlia - Eating this delicate petal may lead to mild gastrointestinal suffering and dermatitis. Daisy - Even though most consider this flower as the bedrock of the garden, several species carry dangerous toxins. Gerbera daisies and the blue-eyed African daisy are pet-safe options. Elephant ear - The leaves of these tropical perennials irritate the mouth and can cause swelling, drooling, and vomiting. Hosta - A pet who dines on the leaves of this shade plant could experience gastrointestinal distress. Iris - Irises come in many different colors, but that rainbow of hues could come at a price for your pet. Symptoms include mild to moderate vomiting, drooling, lethargy, and diarrhea. Rhizomes are the most toxic part of the plant. Lenten rose - Hellebores may delight us with their delicate blooms in winter, but they also cause drooling and stomach upset in dogs and cats. Lily of the valley - We adore this shady flower, but it can produce serious symptoms in pets and people, including vomiting, heart arrhythmias, seizures, coma, and, ultimately, death. Lobelia - Eating plants in this genus, like the cardinal flower and Indian pink, can result in diarrhea, vomiting, and heart rhythm disturbances. Milkweed - A cat or dog that forages on Asclepius spp. can suffer stomach distress followed by seizures, difficulty breathing, and organ failure. Monkshood - This one is a dead giveaway, considering its more common moniker \"wolfsbane.\" All parts of the plant are toxic, especially the roots and seeds. Eating it can cause weakness, heart arrhythmias, paralysis, tremors, and seizures. Peony - The garden and bouquet filler is a favorite among Southerners, but it poses a health hazard to our pets, including vomiting and diarrhea. Yarrow - We may think of it as medicinal, but yarrow can increase urination and cause stomach issues and rashes for pets. Annuals That Are Toxic to Pets Asparagus fern - You may grow this as an annual in your porch containers or as a houseplant year-round; either way, eating the berries could end in stomach upset and vomiting. Begonia - The most toxic part of these plants is the tubers, which can cause irritation of the mouth and vomiting. Coleus - This popular foliage plant for the shade can cause stomach distress and even bloody diarrhea and vomiting. Geranium - Commonly grown in outdoor containers and hanging baskets, Pelargonium species are toxic for pets, causing skin rashes, vomiting, lethargy, and loss of appetite. Kalanchoe - Sometimes grown as an annual and sometimes as a houseplant, pretty kalanchoe can cause gastrointestinal distress and, rarely, an abnormal heart rhythym. Moss rose - Portulaca should not be nibbled on by pets, or they may suffer excess salivating, tremors, and occasionally kidney failure. Nicotania - Considering it contains nicotine, you won't be surprised to hear that flowering tobacco causes excitability. Eating the plant can also lead to loss of coordination, paralysis, or death. Shrubs and Trees That Are Toxic to Pets Apple and cherry trees - The leaves, stems, and seeds of trees in the apple and cherry families contain a toxin that converts to cyanide when chewed. This includes pears, crab apples, peaches, and apricots. Consuming this toxin can lead to shock, often detected by weakness and rapid breathing. Azalea/Rhododendron - These bright and popular garden shrubs are dangerous for your four-legged friends. If leaves are ingested, it can cause digestive problems, excessive drooling, weakness, and loss of appetite. Boxwood - Evergreen and ever-dangerous when a significant amount of its leaves are ingested by your pet. It mostly causes dehydration, due to severe vomiting and diarrhea. Citrus trees - Keep your favorite Meyer lemon away from pets, as the leaves and skins of the fruit contain essential oils that can cause stomach distress and rash. Cycads/sago palm - Cycads can cause serious harm to pets, from gastrointestinal bleeding to liver failure and death. Dog hobble - Also known as fetter bush or black laurel, the leaves of Leucothoe spp. are extremely toxic and can lead to coma or death when ingested. Gardenia - Unfortunately, the white and fragrant blooms of this shrub can take a toll on your pet's health, causing mild gastrointestinal distress and rashes. Holly - Whether you're growing American holly, English holly, or winterberry, holly leaves and berries can cause vomiting and diarrhea. Hydrangea - Summer and fall gift us with hydrangea's large clusters of flowers, but eating this plant can cause vomiting and diarrhea. Lantana - If you've recently planted this small, tropical shrub, look for signs of diarrhea, weakness, or labored breathing in your pet. Oak trees - The acorns are harmful to dogs, potentially causing gastrointestinal discomfort, a choking hazard, or even kidney failure or death. Oleander - This popular blooming shrub is highly toxic, potentially leading to drooling, gastrointestinal symptoms, arrhythmia, and even death. Pieris - Sometimes called Andromeda, nibbling on Japanese pieris can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, and even cardiac failure. Rose of Sharon - Most hibiscus species are non-toxic, but dogs that eat Rose of Sharon (H. syriacus) flowers can have a lack of appetite and vomiting. Both stems and flowers are toxic to cats. Yew - This slow-growing, drought-resistant shrub is attractive in the garden, but it's dangerous for pets and livestock and is known to cause sudden death from acute cardiac failure in dogs. Bulbs That Are Toxic to Pets Amaryllis - We love these beautiful bulbs, but they're extremely toxic. If consumed, it can cause abdominal pain, tremors, diarrhea, and hypersalivation for both cats and dogs. Caladium - Their big flamboyant leaves contain dangerous crystals that can penetrate your pet's skin and mouth, causing severe irritation and difficulty breathing and walking.

Hyacinth - You may be drawn to its sweet scent, but keep your dogs and cats away from this bulb, because it can damage the mouth and esophagus and cause violent tremors. Lily - To put it simply, lilies are definitely not the cat's meow. Easter lilies, Asiatic lilies, and day lilies can cause kidney failure in cats, but don't appear to affect dogs as severely. Tulip - Eating the cup-shaped flower may lead to convulsions, cardiac problems, and gastrointestinal discomfort. Vines That Are Toxic to Pets While these climbing growers are useful for sprucing up your landscaping and vertical space, they can also be toxic to dogs and cats. Clematis - The popular mailbox climber isn't so pretty if your pet eats it, resulting in salivation and digestive problems. English and Boston ivy - The foliage is the most toxic part of these plants and can cause gastrointestinal distress and hyper-salivating. Morning glory - Eating this plant can cause vomiting; eating a large amount of the seeds can lead to hallucination. Sweet pea - The pea-shaped flowers may be delightful in bouquets, but nibbling on these vines can result in weakness or pacing, seizures, and possibly death.
