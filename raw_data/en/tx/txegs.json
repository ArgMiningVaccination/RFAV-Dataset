Manufactured by: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591 U.S. Revised: Aug 2023 SIDE EFFECTS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: - Serious Meningococcal Infections [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] - Other Bacterial Infections [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] - Hypersensitivity Reactions PRECAUTIONS] [Immune Complex](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_complex/definition.htm)Formation [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of VEOPOZ was evaluated in 10 patients with CD55-deficient PLE (ranging from 3 to 19 years of age) in a single-arm study [see Clinical Studies]. The median duration of exposure was 104 weeks (range: 75 to 140 weeks). Adverse reactions reported in two or more patients are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in Two or More VEOPOZ-Treated Patients with CD55-deficient PLE in a Clinical Trial |Adverse Reactions||VEOPOZ | (including dermatitis and erythema), metabolic acidosis, gingival bleeding, increased blood uric acid, increased liver enzymes, hematuria and proteinuria were reported in one patient each. Vital Signs Four patients reported elevated systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure readings above the normal range for age at multiple study visits. DRUG INTERACTIONS Intravenous Immunoglobulin VEOPOZ has not been studied in combination with Intravenous immunoglobulin may interfere with (FcRn) recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies such as pozelimab thereby decrease serum pozelimab concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of intravenous immunoglobulin with VEOPOZ. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor patients for worsening of clinical signs and symptoms of CD55-deficient PLE [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. WARNINGS Included as part of the \"PRECAUTIONS\" Section PRECAUTIONS Serious Meningococcal Infections Life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors. The use of VEOPOZ increases a patient's susceptibility to serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections (septicemia and/or meningitis) caused by any serogroup, including non-groupable strains. Complete or update meningococcal vaccination (for serogroups A, C, W, and Y [MenACWY] and serogroup B [MenB]) at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of VEOPOZ, according to the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations considering the duration of VEOPOZ therapy. If urgent VEOPOZ therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up-to-date with both MenACWY and MenB vaccines according to ACIP recommendations, administer meningococcal vaccine(s) as soon as possible and provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis. The efficacy, duration, and drug regimens for antibacterial drug prophylaxis have not been studied in patients receiving complement inhibitors. Because of inhibition of complement activity by VEOPOZ, as well as risk of infection caused by nongroupable strains of N. meningitidis, vaccination does not eliminate the risk of meningococcal infections, despite development of antibodies following vaccination. Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if infection is suspected. Inform patients and caregivers of these signs and symptoms and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if these signs and symptoms occur. Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Interrupt treatment with VEOPOZ in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious meningococcal infection until the infection is resolved [see CONTRAINDICATIONS]. Other Bacterial Infections VEOPOZ blocks terminal complement activation; therefore, patients may have increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial infections, especially infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis but also Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and lesser extent, Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Patients treated with VEOPOZ may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Administer the prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections according to ACIP guidelines. Patients receiving VEOPOZ are at increased risk for infections due to these organisms, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination. Interrupt treatment with VEOPOZ in patients who are undergoing treatment for a serious encapsulated bacterial infection until the infection is resolved. Counsel patients about gonorrhea prevention and advise regular testing for patients at risk. Systemic Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with administration of complement inhibitors. Interrupt VEOPOZ and institute appropriate supportive measures if signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory compromise occur. Immune Complex Formation Immune complex formation has been reported during the transition of therapy between complement inhibitors, resulting in transient decrease in drug concentrations as well as symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions. However, this has not been studied in patients with CD55-deficient PLE switching from other complement inhibitors to pozelimab. The potential for immune complex formation should be considered if switching complement inhibitors. Patient Counseling Information Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Inform patients that they will be given a Patient Safety Card for VEOPOZ that they should carry with them at all times. This card describes symptoms of meningococcal, or other infection, which, if experienced, should prompt the patient to seek immediate medical evaluation. Meningococcal Infection - Advise patients of the risk of meningococcal, and other bacterial infections. - Inform patients of the need to complete or update meningococcal vaccination for both MenACWY and MenB at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of VEOPOZ and to be revaccinated according to current ACIP recommendations for meningococcal vaccines while on VEOPOZ therapy. - Inform patients that vaccination may not prevent meningococcal infection. - Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if any signs or symptoms of infection occur [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Other Bacterial Infections, Including Gonococcal Infection - Inform patients of the increased risk of other bacterial infections, particularly those due to encapsulated bacteria. - Inform patients of the need to receive vaccinations according to the ACIP recommendations. - Advise patients to report any new signs and symptoms of infection. - Counsel patients about gonorrhea prevention and advise patients at risk (e.g., sexually active) to seek regular testing [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Systemic Hypersensitivity Reactions Advise patients to notify the healthcare provider and seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of systemic hypersensitivity reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Nonclinical Of Fertility Carcinogenesis And Mutagenesis Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with pozelimab-bbfg. The mutagenic potential of pozelimab-bbfg has not been evaluated; however, monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes. Impairment Of Fertility Fertility studies have not been conducted with pozelimab-bbfg. In a 6-month toxicity study in sexually-mature male and female monkeys, pozelimab-bbfg had no adverse effects on histological or functional markers of reproductive function (e.g., estrous cyclicity, testicular volume, ejaculate amount, total sperm count per ejaculate, sperm motility and morphology, and histology of reproductive organs) at doses up to 100 mg/kg/week (11.9 to 13.9-fold the predicted exposures at the recommended clinical doses, on an AUC basis). Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Risk Summary Although there are no data on VEOPOZ use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, monoclonal antibodies can be actively transported across the placenta. In an animal reproduction study in monkeys, pozelimab-bbfg did not adversely affect embryofetal or postnatal development when administered from pregnancy confirmation through parturition at doses that produced exposure up to 3.3 to 3.8 times the predicted clinical exposures (on an AUC basis; see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other outcome. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an enhanced pre- and postnatal development study, pregnant female monkeys were subcutaneously administered pozelimab-bbfg at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg once weekly from confirmation of pregnancy (gestation day 20) through parturition (approximately gestation day 160). No adverse effects were observed on maintenance of pregnancy, pregnancy outcome, or on the development of offspring through postnatal day 90 at doses up to 3.3-3.8 times the predicted clinical exposures. Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of pozelimab-bbfg in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Endogenous maternal IgG and monoclonal antibodies are transferred into human milk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and the extent of systemic exposure in the breastfed infant to pozelimab are unknown. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for VEOPOZ and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from VEOPOZ or from the underlying maternal condition. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of VEOPOZ for the treatment of CD55-deficient PLE have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older. Use of VEOPOZ for this indication is supported by a single-arm study in 10 patients with active CD55-deficient PLE [see ADVERSE REACTIONS and Clinical Studies]. The safety and effectiveness of VEOPOZ have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. Geriatric Use CD55-deficient PLE is largely a disease of pediatric patients. VEOPOZ has not been studied in the geriatric population. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism Of Action Pozelimab-bbfg is a human, monoclonal immunoglobulin G4P (IgG4P) antibody directed against the terminal complement protein C5 that inhibits terminal complement activation by blocking cleavage of C5 into C5a (anaphylatoxin) and C5b, thereby blocking the formation of the membrane-attack complex (C5b-C9, a structure mediating cell lysis). Pharmacodynamics The effect of pozelimab-bbfg on complement activity was measured by total complement hemolytic activity test (CH50). The magnitude and duration of reduction from baseline in CH50 by pozelimab-bbfg was dose dependent. In healthy subjects receiving a single dose of VEOPOZ 30 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over approximately one hour, the complete inhibition of CH50 was achieved at the end of infusion in all subjects, was maintained for 28 days, and returned to baseline 84 days post-dose. After a single dose of VEOPOZ administered as a 600 mg subcutaneous injection, the maximum reduction from baseline in CH50 was achieved 7 days post-dose in most subjects (range: 3 to 14 days), corresponding to Tmax, and returned to baseline 56 days post-dose. In patients with CD55-deficient PLE receiving a single 30 mg/kg dose administered as an intravenous infusion over approximately one hour followed by a weight-tiered subcutaneous injection once weekly starting at Week 1, CH50 was completely inhibited by Week 1 for most subjects and by Week 12 for all patients. In the same study of patients with CD55-deficient PLE, serum albumin concentrations increased as early as Week 1 and reached the normal range (3.5 g/dL) by Week 4 for most subjects and by Week 12 for all subjects. The serum albumin concentrations were maintained within the normal range for the duration of treatment. Endogenous serum IgG concentrations were also increased from baseline at Week 1 in all patients with CD55-deficient PLE and reached a stable concentration around Week 16 [see Clinical Studies]. Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, single intravenous infusions of VEOPOZ over approximately one hour resulted in dose proportional increases in mean Cmax, but greater than proportional increases in mean AUCinf (>16-fold) for total pozelimab concentrations in serum between 3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg. The mean AUCinf increased by 3.5-fold between 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg. In healthy subjects, single subcutaneous injections of VEOPOZ resulted in approximately 1.5-fold increase in mean Cmax and 2.2-fold increase in mean AUCinf between 300 mg and 600 mg. In patients with CD55-deficient PLE, a single dose of VEOPOZ 30 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over approximately one hour resulted in median (range) total pozelimab trough concentration of 180 (52.8, 268) mg/L at Week 1. The predicted mean (SD) trough concentrations of total pozelimab at steady state are 330 (94.2) mg/L and 385 (112) mg/L for VEOPOZ 10 mg/kg or 12 mg/kg (up to a maximum 800 mg) once weekly via subcutaneous injection(s), respectively, following the intravenous loading dose. Absorption In healthy subjects, following subcutaneous injection of 600 mg, the bioavailability of pozelimab-bbfg is estimated as 51%. The median (range) time to reach peak concentration was 7 (3 to 7) days following a single subcutaneous injection of 300 mg or 600 mg in healthy subjects. Distribution In healthy adult subjects with a mean body weight of 70 kg, the mean (SD) volume of distribution following a single intravenous dose of 30 mg/kg was 3.3 (0.4) L. The mean (SD) apparent volume of distribution following a single subcutaneous injection of 300 mg and 600 mg was 6.0 (0.9) L and 8.6 (2.7) L, respectively. Elimination Pozelimab-bbfg is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Pozelimab-bbfg elimination is mediated via linear and non-linear pathways. At higher concentrations, pozelimab-bbfg elimination is primarily through the linear non-saturable proteolytic pathway, whereas at lower concentrations, the non-linear, saturable C5 target-mediated elimination predominates. In healthy adult subjects, the median (range) terminal half-life of total pozelimab in serum was 13.5 (10.0, 17.2) days following a single 30 mg/kg dose administered as an intravenous infusion. The median (range) terminal half-life was 14.1 (8.6, 17.3) days following a single 600 mg subcutaneous injection. In patients with CD55-deficient PLE, steady-state total pozelimab concentrations were reached at approximately 20 weeks following subcutaneous injection once weekly. Specific Populations Body Weight Body weight was a significant covariate on the pharmacokinetics of pozelimab-bbfg. Renal And Hepatic Impairment Pozelimab-bbfg, a monoclonal antibody, is not likely to undergo renal or hepatic excretion. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction studies have not been conducted. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) may interfere with the endosomal neonatal Fc (FcRn) recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies as pozelimab-bbfg, which may decrease serum pozelimab concentrations [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the study described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of VEOPOZ or of other pozelimab products. Nine of the 10 patients 3 years of age and older with CD55-deficient PLE in the clinical study were evaluable for anti-pozelimab antibodies. None of these patients developed anti-pozelimabbbfg antibodies during the 48-week treatment with pozelimab-bbfg. There is insufficient information to characterize the effect of anti-drug antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of pozelimab. Clinical Studies The efficacy and safety of VEOPOZ were evaluated in a single-arm study (NCT04209634) where outcomes were compared to pre-treatment data in patients with active CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) who had hypoalbuminemia. Diagnosis was based on a clinical history of PLE and with a confirmed genotype of biallelic CD55 loss-of-function mutation. Active CD55-deficient PLE as hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin concentration of 3.2 g/dL) with one or more of the following signs or symptoms within the last six months: abdominal pain, diarrhea, peripheral edema, or facial edema. Patients received a single 30 mg/kg loading dose of VEOPOZ administered by intravenous infusion over approximately one hour, followed by a once weekly weight-tiered maintenance dosage, administered as a subcutaneous injection starting one week after the loading dose. All patients received meningococcal vaccination prior to treatment with VEOPOZ and antibacterials for prophylaxis of meningococcal infection. Patients were permitted to receive additional therapies as part of standard of care. Use of other complement inhibitors was prohibited. Ten patients ranging from 3 to 19 years of age (median of 8.5 years) were assessed for efficacy. Six patients identified as female; seven patients as White, two patients as Asian, and one patient reported race as other. The mean baseline serum albumin concentration was 2.2 g/dL with a range of 1.1 to 2.9 g/dL. Serum Albumin Concentrations The median time for serum albumin to reach at least 3.5 g/dL was 15.5 days (N=10; 95% CI: 8 to 28). All 10 patients achieved normalization by Week 12 and maintained serum albumin concentrations within the normal range through at least 72 weeks of treatment (Figure 1). Figure 1: Serum Albumin Concentrations from 48 Weeks Pre-Treatment Through 72 Weeks on VEOPOZ in Ten Patients with CD-55 Deficient PLE Albumin Transfusions Five of the 10 patients received a total of 60 transfusions in the 48 weeks prior to treatment. In the 48 weeks after starting treatment, one patient received one [albumin](https://www.rxlist.com/albumin/definition.htm) [transfusion](https://www.rxlist.com/transfusion/definition.htm). Hospitalizations Nine of the 10 patients were hospitalized for a total of 268 days in the 48 weeks prior to treatment. In the 48 weeks after starting treatment, two patients were hospitalized for a total of 7 days. Additional Efficacy Results Serum [IgG](https://www.rxlist.com/igg/definition.htm) concentrations reached normal values for age in all patients within the first 12 weeks of treatment; improvement was maintained through at least 72 weeks of treatment. PATIENT INFORMATION VEOPOZ (VEE-oh-poz) (pozelimab-bbfg) injection, for intravenous or subcutaneous use What is the most important information I should know about VEOPOZ? VEOPOZ is a medicine that affects your immune system. VEOPOZ can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. VEOPOZ increases your chance of getting serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections. Meningococcal infections may quickly become life-threatening and cause death if not recognized and treated early. - You must receive meningococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks before your first dose of VEOPOZ if you have not already had these vaccines. - If you had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, you might need additional [vaccination](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccination/definition.htm)before starting VEOPOZ. Your healthcare provider will decide if you need additional meningococcal vaccination. - If your healthcare provider decided that urgent treatment with VEOPOZ is needed, and your meningococcal vaccines are not up-to-date, you should receive meningococcal vaccination as soon as possible. You should also receive antibiotics. - Meningococcal vaccines reduce the risk of meningococcal infection but do not prevent all meningococcal infections. Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical care right away if you get any of these signs and symptoms of a meningococcal infection: - headache with nausea or vomiting - headache and fever - headache with a stiff neck or stiff back - fever - fever and a rash - confusion muscle aches with flu-like symptoms - eyes sensitive to light Your healthcare provider will give you a Patient Safety Card about the symptoms of meningococcal, or other infection. Carry it with you at all times during treatment and for 3 months after your last VEOPOZ dose. Your risk of meningococcal infection may continue for several weeks after your last dose of VEOPOZ. It is important to show this card to any healthcare provider who treats you. This will help them diagnose and treat you quickly. VEOPOZ may also increase the risk of other types of serious bacterial infections. - People who take VEOPOZ may have an increased risk of getting infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. - Certain people may also have an increased risk of bacterial infections including [gonorrhea](https://www.rxlist.com/gonorrhea/definition.htm)infection. Talk to your healthcare provider to find out if you are at risk of gonorrhea infection, about gonorrhea prevention, and regular testing. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any new signs or symptoms of infection. What is VEOPOZ? VEOPOZ is a prescription medicine called a [monoclonal](https://www.rxlist.com/monoclonal/definition.htm) antibody. VEOPOZ is used to treat adults and children 1 year of age and older with a disease called CD55-deficient protein-losing [enteropathy](https://www.rxlist.com/enteropathy/definition.htm) (PLE), also known as CHAPLE disease. It is not known if VEOPOZ is safe and effective in children younger than 1 year of age. Do not receive VEOPOZ if you: - have a meningococcal infection. Before you receive VEOPOZ, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: - have an infection or fever. - are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if VEOPOZ will harm your unborn baby. - are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if VEOPOZ passes into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby during treatment with VEOPOZ. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. It is important that you: - have all recommended vaccinations before you start VEOPOZ. - receive antibiotics if you start VEOPOZ within 2 weeks of receiving meningococcal vaccination. - stay up to date with all recommended vaccinations during treatment with VEOPOZ. VEOPOZ and other medicines may affect each other causing side effects. VEOPOZ may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how VEOPOZ works. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg). Know the medicines you take and the vaccines you receive. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I receive VEOPOZ? - The first dose of VEOPOZ is given through a vein (I.V. or intravenous infusion) usually over 1 hour or more, depending on your weight. If you have an allergic reaction during your VEOPOZ infusion, your healthcare provider may decide to give VEOPOZ more slowly or stop your infusion. - You will then receive VEOPOZ one time each week starting on day 8 after the first dose, as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). - After the infusion and your first subcutaneous injection, you will be monitored for 30 minutes for allergic reactions. - If you miss receiving a VEOPOZ subcutaneous dose, call your healthcare provider right away to find out when you will receive your next injection.
