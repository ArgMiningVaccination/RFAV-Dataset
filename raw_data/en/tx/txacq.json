Within a year, a few COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized. This unparalleled initiative in developing vaccines created many uncertainties looming around the efficacy and safety of these vaccines. This study aimed to assess the side effects and perceptions following COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing an online survey targeted toward Jordan inhabitants who received any COVID-19 vaccines. Data were statistically analyzed and certain machine learning (ML) tools, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and K-star were used to predict the severity of side effects. Results: A total of 2213 participants were involved in the study after receiving Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and other vaccines (38.2%, 31%, 27.3%, and 3.5%, respectively). Generally, most of the post-vaccination side effects were common and non-life-threatening (e.g., fatigue, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia). Only 10% of participants suffered from severe side effects; while 39% and 21% of participants had moderate and mild side effects, respectively. Despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against COVID-19 infection. Finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety; while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. Furthermore, based on the type of vaccine, demographic data, and side effects, the RF, XGBoost, and MLP gave both high accuracies (0.80, 0.79, and 0.70, respectively) and Cohen's kappa values (0.71, 0.70, and 0.56, respectively). Conclusions: The present study confirmed that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. Most of the post-vaccination side effects are mild to moderate, which are signs that body's immune system is building protection. ML can also be used to predict the severity of side effects based on the input data; predicted severe cases may require more medical attention or even hospitalization.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-05-26", "cleaned_text": "Side Effects and Perceptions Following COVID-19 Vaccination in Jordan: A Randomized, Cross-Sectional Study Implementing Machine Learning for Predicting Severity of Side Effects [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060556](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060556) [Psychological Aspects of COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake: Principles and Empirical Strategies]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/Psychological_vaccines )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00556)]. Although many therapeutic compounds and drugs have been suggested and repurposed in the fight against COVID-19, they remained as supportive treatment options [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00556), [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00556)]. [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00556)]. The only way for resuming normal life and rescuing global economies remains the invention of a vaccine. Therefore, health agencies, university researchers, and medical companies have sparked a race to create and produce effective vaccines [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00556), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00556)]. Vaccines for COVID-19 are being produced at a rate never seen before. With this unparalleled initiative comes post-marketing safety monitoring and vaccine safety problems [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00556)]. [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00556)]. A total of 82 vaccines were under the category of protein subunit, 32 were RNA-based, 30 non-replicating viral vector, 23 replicating viral vector, 22 virus-like particle, 20 inactivated virus, 4 live-attenuated virus, 2 replicating bacterial vector, and 16 unknown. However, only four COVID-19 vaccines were authorized in all countries of the BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), CoronaVac (Sinovac), and COVAXIN (Bharat Biotech) have also finished phase III clinical trials and have currently been authorized for emergency use in many countries [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00556)]. [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00556)]. The current situation in Jordan is considered worse than the first wave, as the country is suffering from the second wave of COVID-19, which is mainly attributed to the faster transmission of the UK coronavirus variant (known as B.1.1.7). Thus, the government announced stricter measures to combat the outbreak [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00556)]. On the other hand, on 23 December 2020 the Ministry of Health in Jordan has launched the national vaccination campaign and invited everyone who lives in Jordan to register for free vaccination against COVID-19. Till this moment, the number of fully vaccinated people in Jordan is ~122,000 (~1.2%), and the total number of doses given is 665,000 (Jordanian Ministry of Health, 2021). [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00556)], has contributed to the emergence of many rumors. Vaccine rumors are well-persistent during the post-vaccination period. Rumors that COVID-19 vaccines are linked to various post-vaccination adverse effects (such as infertility) continue to circulate and be debated on various social media sites [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00556)]. Jordanians' ability to participate in a COVID-19 vaccination has been investigated in previous studies. According to the findings, a low percentage of participants (36.1%) expressed interest in participating in vaccine clinical trials [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00556)]. Another study also found that COVID-19 misinformation and conspiracy beliefs have a negative impact on vaccine hesitancy among Jordanians [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00556)]. This may be a major impediment to the pandemic's good management. Vaccine hesitancy was linked to a dependence on social media as the primary source of knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00556)]. Therefore, since different vaccines are being used in Jordan's national vaccination campaign, there is a significant need to assess side effects and perceptions after vaccination in order to tackle vaccine hesitancy and rumors. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Participants 2.2. The Online Survey Tool [Supplementary Material](#app1-vaccines-09-00556)) was developed after an extensive literature search that included Medline/PubMed, Google Scholar, and other databases. As a result, a wide spectrum of potential post-vaccination side effects was identified and covered in this survey. Several questions were also added to record participants' demographic data and to assess their general health status before getting vaccinated, as well as their pre- and post-vaccination perceptions about COVID-19 vaccines. 2.3. Sample Size 2.4. Statistical Analysis 2.5. Machine Learning [Supplementary Material](#app1-vaccines-09-00556)); these omitted questions were about self-beliefs and emotions, and thus they were excluded to prevent bias in the prediction process. The output was the severity of the post-vaccination side effects (i.e., no, mild, moderate, and severe side effects). 2.5.1. Random Forest (RF) [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00556), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00556), [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00556)]. RF is based on an ensemble of decision trees (DTs). Each tree predicts a classification independently and \"votes\" for the related class, and most of the votes decide the overall RF predictions [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00556)]. RF learner node within KNIME Analytics Platform was implemented with the following settings: splitting criterion is the information gain ratio, which normalizes the standard information gain by the split entropy to overcome any unfair preference for nominal splits with many child nodes, while the number of trees is 100. No limitations were imposed on the number of levels or minimum node size. The accuracy was calculated using out-of-bag internal validation. 2.5.2. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00556), We implemented the XGBoost learner node within KNIME Analytics Platform with the following settings: tree booster was implemented with depth wise grow policy, boosting rounds = 100, Eta = 0.3, Gamma = 0, maximum depth = 6, minimum child weight = 1, maximum delta step = 0, subsampling rate = 1, column sampling rate by tree = 1, column sampling rate by level = 1, lambda = 1, Alpha = 0, sketch epsilon = 0.03, scaled position weight = 1, maximum number of bins = 256, sample type (uniform), normalize type (tree), and dropout rate = 0. 2.5.3. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00556)]. MLP has the capacity to learn nonlinear models in real-time. MLP can have one or more nonlinear hidden layers between the input and output layers. For each hidden layer, different numbers of hidden neurons can be assigned. Each hidden neuron gives a weighted linear summation for the values from the previous layer, and the nonlinear activation function is followed. The output values were reported after the output layer transforms the values from the last hidden layer. We implemented MLP learner node within KNIME Analytics Platform with the following optimized parameters: maximum number of iterations = 100, number of hidden layers = 3, and number of hidden neurons per layer = 100. 2.5.4. K-Star (K*) [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00556)]. The default settings were used: average column entropy curve is used for missing mode, and manual blend setting is 20%. 2.5.5. ML Model Evaluation [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00556)] against the testing sets. [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00556)]. 3. Results 3.1. Demographic Data [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00556-t001)). 3.2. Pre-Vaccination [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00556-t002)). Based on their personal knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines, most of the participants (54%) expressed that they would prefer to get Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine if they can choose before vaccination, 20% had no preferred vaccine, and 16% of them preferred the severity of side effects among participants differed based on the type of COVID-19 vaccine. Most of the participants who reported high percentages of moderate to severe side effects (in descending order) were received AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Sinopharm vaccines, and vice versa for those who recorded no to mild side effects ( the frequencies of all these side effects, regardless of the type of received COVID-19 vaccine. The most common side effects were fatigue/tiredness (58.20%), injection site pain and swelling (53.45%), laziness (45.36%), joints pain (41.48%), and fever (37.37%), respectively. Other side effects were less common among vaccinated participants ( [Figure 6](#vaccines-09-00556-f006)). [Figure 7](#vaccines-09-00556-f007)). Furthermore, more than half of them (56%) stated that these side effects lasted for one to three days, and 30% for less than one day ( [Figure 8](#vaccines-09-00556-f008)). To relieve post-vaccination side effects, most of the participants (66%) took painkillers with staying at home, without the need for hospitalization, or even to consult a doctor, while 31% of them took only a rest at home without any medication ( [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00556-f009)). 3.3.2. Side Effects and Number of Doses [Table 5](#vaccines-09-00556-t005)). The test showed significant associations between the number of doses and the possibility of infection with COVID-19 after vaccination (p = 0.00) and a few side effects including nausea (p = 0.04), chills (p = 0.05), sleepiness and laziness (p = 0.00), cold/numbness and tingling in limbs (p = 0.00), dizziness (p = 0.02), and abnormal blood pressure (p = 0.05). 3.3.3. Side Effects and Types of Vaccines [Table 6](#vaccines-09-00556-t006)). The results showed significant associations between types of vaccine and several side effects including injection site pain and swelling (p = 0.00), sleepiness and laziness (p = 0.00), chills (p = 0.02), clogged or runny nose (p = 0.02), and sore or dry throat (p = 0.02). The severity and number of side effects were also significantly associated with types of vaccine (p = 0.00). 3.4. ML to Predict the Severity of Side Effects [Table 7](#vaccines-09-00556-t007); [Table 8](#vaccines-09-00556-t008)shows the accuracy, Cohen's , true positive rate (TPR), and true negative rate (TNR) to predict the severity of side effects after receiving different COVID-19 vaccines using different ML tools based on demographic data and other participants responses. 4. Discussion [Figure 10](#vaccines-09-00556-f010)A, the main vaccines received by the participants were Sinopharm, Pfizer-BioNTech, and AstraZeneca, respectively. Obviously, the most abundant severe side effects were reported by those who received the AstraZeneca vaccine, while \"no symptoms\" are mostly reported by those who received Sinopharm vaccine, as shown in [Figure 10](#vaccines-09-00556-f010)B. [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00556)]. Another study from the Asia-Pacific region showed that around 95% of 1720 healthcare workers were willing to vaccinate against COVID-19 [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00556)]. Therefore, a number of early studies have recruited healthcare workers to assess the potential side effects following COVID-19 vaccination [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00556), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00556), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00556), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00556)]. [Table 9](#vaccines-09-00556-t009)), despite the received COVID-19 vaccine, the most common post-vaccination side effects were fatigue, injection site pain and swelling, headache, sleepiness and laziness, chills, myalgia, joint pain, and fever. However, most of these studies have assessed mainly the post-vaccination side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00556), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00556), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00556), [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00556), [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00556)], while only two studies on the AstraZeneca vaccine [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00556), [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00556)]. [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00556)]. In fact, due to the urgency of this issue, most of the participants in the previous studies that assessed the post-vaccination side effects had only received the first dose of their COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, further studies with a greater number of participants who received the second dose are still required in order to confirm this point. Furthermore, the propensity for infection with COVID-19 significantly decreased among participants who received the second dose of the vaccine (p = 0.00), implying the value of obtaining the full vaccination. Except for nausea, chills, sleepiness and laziness, cold/numbness and tingling in limbs, dizziness, and abnormal blood pressure, the majority of side effects showed no significant association with the number of doses ( [Table 5](#vaccines-09-00556-t005)). vector) containing the full-length structural SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, with a leader sequence (DNA) fused to a tissue-type plasminogen activator [ [36](#B36-vaccines-09-00556)]. The S protein plays a crucial role in penetrating host cells and initiating infection of all SARS viruses, and thus it is a major target in the development of vaccines and therapeutics which help in modulating the host response to COVID-19 [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00556)]. The AstraZeneca vaccine expresses a codon-optimized coding sequence for the S protein in the human body, which results in building immunity against SARS-CoV-2 [ [36](#B36-vaccines-09-00556)]. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is nucleoside-modified mRNAs, formulated in lipid nanoparticles, encoding the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, modified by two proline mutations to lock it in the prefusion conformation [ [37](#B37-vaccines-09-00556)]. Despite the fact that RNA is a relatively unstable molecule, novel vaccine designs have been developed to improve its stability and protein translation performance, which has resulted in an improved immune response with a high level of neutralizing antibodies [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-00556)]. [39](#B39-vaccines-09-00556)]. Although DNA vaccines are easy to produce and store with an excellent stability and a limited toxicity [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-00556)], the concerns about their safety and immunogenicity still require further investigation. In the rhesus macaque model studies, 5 of 6 lung lobes in the vaccinated group with AstraZeneca vaccine showed a detectable viral load, while after using Sinopharm vaccine there was no detectable viral load [ [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00556), [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00556)]. However, these studies showed that both AstraZeneca and Sinopharm vaccines conferred effective protection and prevented viral interstitial pneumonia. [Table 10](#vaccines-09-00556-t010)). After several reports from different countries across Europe [ [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00556)], the rare risk of thrombocytopenia and unusual blood clots associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine was confirmed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [ [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00556)]. Recently, concerns started to emerge about the same risks among a few people vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. A report from Italy shows that a 66-year-old woman has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis, despite all blood tests (including platelet count and clotting-related tests) being normal [ [44](#B44-vaccines-09-00556)]. However, the benefits of these vaccines extremely outweigh their risks, especially knowing the risk of mortality resulting from COVID-19 and that it could cause a greater risk of thrombocytopenia and unusual blood clots [ [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00556), [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00556)]. [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00556)]. A study showed that the von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and P-selectin are critically involved in a complex platelet-leukocyte-endothelial interplay, resulting in platelet activation and accelerated platelet clearance following adenovirus administration [ [48](#B48-vaccines-09-00556)]. This probably explains the risk of thrombocytopenia and blood clots associated with adenovirus-based vaccines (i.e., AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines). However, it is important to avoid any mistaken identification of other causes as post-vaccination side effects. Therefore, for patients who develop serious symptoms after vaccination, it is necessary to study their health history and full clinical profile to confirm whether these are vaccination-related side effects or not. [49](#B49-vaccines-09-00556)], and thus it is one of the most administrated COVID-19 vaccines globally. The reason for this preference could also be attributed to the huge number of online available resources (i.e., studies, web pages, articles, etc.) that recommended its safety and efficacy. Meanwhile, in the present study, the main sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines among participants were medical and scientific websites ( [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00556-t002)). [Table 6](#vaccines-09-00556-t006)), it was clear that Sinopharm vaccine has the lowest ratio (33/845), followed by AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines (39/686 and 39/605, respectably). However, a recent study by Amit et al. [ [50](#B50-vaccines-09-00556)] showed that the ratio of vaccinated people infected with COVID-19 after receiving the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to the total number of study's participants is 22/4081, while in the present study it is 24/342 after the first dose only. This variation in ratios could be due to the fact that Amit et al.'s study [ [50](#B50-vaccines-09-00556)] involved only healthcare workers; this category of the population is supposed to be well-educated and has a further strict adherence in following prevention measures to avoid COVID-19 infection [ [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00556)]. In Amit's study [ [50](#B50-vaccines-09-00556)], individuals infected with COVID-19 were also tested in the early post-vaccination period (1-10 days), while there was no time limit in the present study. [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00556)]. Fear and suspicion, as well as a lack of information about clinical trials, have all been identified as factors that may lead to hesitancy in receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, the COVID-19 epidemiological situation in the country could also influence vaccine use [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00556)]. In the present study, most of the participants were scared of the COVID-19 vaccine before receiving it (53%). However, the overall picture dramatically changed after vaccination; most of the participants felt more reassured and have advised others to get vaccinated (80%). [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00556)]. [Table 8](#vaccines-09-00556-t008)) were used as [Table 8](#vaccines-09-00556-t008), learners achieved different accuracies; which prompted us to use Cohen's as additional success criteria of the resulting ML models. Cohen's is a more robust measure than accuracy, as it takes into account the possibility of prediction by chance [ [52](#B52-vaccines-09-00556)]. Fleiss's [ [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00556)] equally arbitrary guidelines characterize Cohen's over 0.75 as excellent, 0.40 to 0.75 as fair to good, and below 0.40 as poor. [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00556)]. [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00556)]. Access to these cases may be difficult, particularly during pandemics where a large number of people are infected. ML, on the other hand, is designed to assist in such circumstances by predicting people who may experience serious life-threatening adverse effects based on the type of vaccine, demographic data, and simplified recorded symptoms. These expected cases may necessitate immediate hospitalization and additional medical care. Furthermore, ML may assist in identifying avoidable hospital admissions, reducing the pressure on hospitals. [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00556)]. Another study showed that, if a cohort of 10 million people were to be vaccinated against H1N1 influenza in China, 11.5, 80.2, and 481.5 cases of sudden cardiac death would be expected to occur as coincident temporal associations with vaccination, within 1 day, 1 week, and 6 weeks after immunization, respectively [ [57](#B57-vaccines-09-00556)]. The findings of such studies may help health authorities to assess the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and the effectiveness of mass immunization, and could improve future vaccine education and use. 5.
