Ayurveda is an ancient natural healing system that has stood the test of time. Originally native in India and South East Asia, it is in fact considered by a majority of people to be the oldest traditional way of treatment that exists. The Three Building Blocks of Ayurveda This holistic approach is based on three doshas: [Kapha, Vata, and Pitta](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/learning-ayurveda/vata-pitta-and-kapha/) and a belief that the illness and disease come from an imbalance between the three energies. The main goal of [Ayurvedic treatments](https://www.centenaryphysio.com/services/ayurvedic-scarborough/) is to treat health conditions without any side effects, pain, the need for prescription drugs, complex surgery and help people live healthy and balanced lives. In fact, Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word that means \"science of life\" or \"lifespan build on knowledge\". Although a majority of Indians rely on traditional Ayurvedic practices to cure all their health problems, from digestive issues to infertility for centuries, in recent years, alternative health practices like [Ayurveda](https://www.centenaryphysio.com/services/ayurvedic-scarborough/) and Traditional Chinse Medicine are also becoming more and more popular in the Western World. Ayurvedic [practitioners](https://www.centenaryphysio.com/team-member/sandeep-ram/) at Centenary Physio & Rehab in our Scarborough Clinic suggest lifestyle modifications, a healthy and balanced diet, stress relief, and ayurvedic treatments and massages to treat all kinds of diseases and health conditions by helping the body regain its balance. The general opinion is that illness and disease result from an imbalance between the three doshas or energy pathways; Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. According to Ayurvedic medicine, each person has got some unique properties in terms of the individual balance between these three types of energy pathways. All have their own Kapha, Vata, and Pitta personality, but generally, one or two doshas are more dominant in a particular person that further describe his or her body type, energy levels, appetite, tendencies, moods, and intellectual level. In other words, doshas are like genes present in chromosomes that define your personality traits. Each dosha has physical and cognitive characteristics, therefore Ayurvedic practitioners use these energy pathways to describe the common traits, diagnose the underlying conditions and define the body type and personality. [Ayurvedic treatments](https://www.centenaryphysio.com/services/ayurvedic-scarborough/) at Centenary Physio & Rehab Scarborough takes every individual as a separate entity when dealing with illnesses or prescribing holistic treatments. According to the Western medical point of view, better control of stress seems to be one of the main benefits of Ayurveda. As chronic stress can ruin your quality of life and lower levels of stress and anxiety are related to weight control, longevity, and happiness, Ayurveda can play a key role in defining your health.
