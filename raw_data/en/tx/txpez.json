Homeopathy healing is a holistic healing approach that majorly promotes the body's self healing and it has some major principles like \"like cures like\" and \"more dilution means more potency\". Homeopathic healers promote natural healing instead of traditional medicines; moreover, they prescribe those natural substances to a sick person that cause the same specific symptoms in a healthy person. For example, if onion is causing tears in a healthy person then onion's remedy may be prescribed to an ill person having symptoms of tears.
