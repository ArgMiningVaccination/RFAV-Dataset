WOOD, symbolized by shades of green, represents spring, trees and plants, and the health of the liver and gall bladder. When we nurture Wood, we cultivate tenderness and kindness and heal anger and frustration. FIRE, signified by red and pink, represents summer; sun, stars, and flames; and the health of the heart and small intestine. Harmonious Fire nurtures love and joy as antidotes to anxiety and impatience. EARTH \u2014 brown and yellow \u2014 represents late summer, soil and stone, and the health of the stomach and spleen. Tending the Earth element transforms worry and panic into fairness and openness. METAL \u2014 gold and silver \u2014 represents autumn, ores from the Earth, and the health of the lungs and large intestine. Metal in balance gives us confidence and courage and heals sadness and grief. WATER \u2014 blue and purple \u2014 represents winter, ocean and stream, and the health of the kidneys, bladder, and reproductive system. By nurturing Water we transform fear and stress into gentleness and calmness. General Wellness Traditional Chinese Medicine to the needs of people at all ages and stages of life.

Seasonal Update [Summer 2023](https://wushealingcenter.com/summer-2023/) Dr. Angela C. Wu taught me to apply the lofty theories I studied in Chinese medical school to the pragmatic setting of her busy clinic. I am forever indebted to my teacher for mentoring me in the fundamental principles of Chinese medical theory. After three decades working in both holistic and modern health care industries, Wu's Healing Center continues to serve as the best example I've seen of a consistently top-notch team working in unison to provide comprehensive, holistic, effective care for patients. As an allopathic physician, I have been deeply impressed at the level of healing and ongoing health maintenance results in Dr. Wu's approach. Her unique skills and gifted talents and optimal outcomes with a wide range of patients are legendary. I expect TCM to be part of my life for life. And I know Dr. Wu's wisdom will always be with me. Her positive messages have helped me heal myself, and helped me raise my kids. I have been and will always continue to be a student of Dr. Angela Wu's. Being in her presence, in and outside of the clinic, has helped my personal and professional life immensely. Dr. Wu is one of the earliest licensed acupuncturists in the U.S., and the capacity to run a thriving TCM practice through all these decades takes tremendous strength, discipline, responsibility, and courage. What struck me most was Dr. Wu's emphasis on listening, communication, and self-awareness within the treatment room.

I seek the highest knowledge humans can attain,\" the student replied. \"What can I learn from you, an old hermit?\" As the student spoke, the teacher poured and poured until the tea flowed onto the table, then the floor. \"Stop!\" cried the student. \"Can't you see that the tea is overflowing?\" \"Yes, I see,\" said the sage, \"that I cannot serve you, because your cup is already full.
