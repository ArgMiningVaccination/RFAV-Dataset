CONSTANTINO: And if you have written 2documents, if you could provide me with your written 3comments for the court reporter. 4 THE COURT REPORTER: Thank you. 5 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Mr. Shepley, you can 6proceed. 7 MR. SHEPLEY: Thank you very much. 8 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the 9Board. My name is Aaron Shepley. I am here on 10Project No. 15-44, the request from Transformative 11Health of McHenry for a CON to create an acute 12care -- or a postacute care facility in McHenry. 13 I am the general counsel and president of 14insurance services for Centegra Health System, and 15we're here today for two reasons: Number one, 16I wish to express our unequivocal -- Centegra's 17unequivocal -- I can't get it out -- unequivocal 18support for this project. It's going to enhance 19access to care for members of our community. It's 20going to help us to continue to keep people close to 21home. 22 It will not diminish Centegra Health 23Systems' long-standing relationship with other 24long-term care providers in the area and -- you DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS15 1know, for example, in calendar year 2014 alone, we 2had 750 of our patients who were required to get 3postacute care services outside of McHenry County, 4so this will help to eliminate that issue. 5 Number two and more importantly, I want to 6make sure that members have a full understanding of 7what Centegra's role in this project is and is not. 8I want to make clear that, while we have unequivocal 9support for this project, this is not Centegra's 10project. 11 Centegra has no ownership or other financial 12interest in any Applicant, there is no mortgage or 13loan being given by Centegra for any Applicant, 14there is no sale of the property that's -- on which 15this project is proposed to be located. 16 The only relationship that we have to this 17project, other than its siting on our campus, is 18that we will have a long-term land lease that will 19involve nominal annual payments to Centegra. There 20is no other financial connection whatsoever to this 21project by Centegra Health. 22 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 23 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 24 MR. SHEPLEY: We hope you will support it. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS16 1 Thank you. 2 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 3 MS. MITCHELL: Mr. Goldberg, you can go 4next. 5 MR. GOLDBERG: Thank you. 6 Good morning, Madam Chairman and respected 7members of the Board. Thank you for allowing me the 8opportunity to speak before you today in support of 9Transformative Health of McHenry. 10 My name is Edward M. Goldberg, and I was a 11hospital administrator for 38 years. I was the 12president of the St. Alexius Medical Center in 13Hoffman Estates for 18 years, from July 19th, 1994, 14until November 2nd, 2012. I retired due to being 15diagnosed with incurable large B-cell lymphoma. 16I am here today to encourage you to vote in favor of 17Project No. 15-044. 18 I've known the managers and owners of this 19project since early 2008 when they approached me to 20receive my input in developing a new project and 21have required -- and they subsequently appointed me 22to be a member of their community advisory board in 23late 2008. This transitional care facility, the 24Claremont of Hanover Park, opened in 2010. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS17 1 Having an incurable disease, I have to face 2the reality of seeking out a facility where my 3cancer causes me to require skilled nursing 4facilities. Although I live in Deerfield, Illinois, 531 miles from St. Alexius Medical Center and 635 miles from the Claremont, I want to be at a 7facility that allows me to be transferred to 8St. Alexius where all of my physicians practice. 9 To provide for some perspective, there are 10118 nursing skilled facilities within a 30-minute 11drive of St. Alexius Medical Center. When 12necessary, I will choose to go to the Claremont 13because of the consistent positive feedback I heard 14from patients who utilized the facility and then 15returned to my hospital, St. Alexius. Their 16comments focused on tangibles, such as cleanliness 17of the facility, decor, homelike amenities, 18friendliness of staff, and competencies of the 19medical, nursing, and therapy teams. 20 I also took notice of their intangible 21comments that focused on the holistic healing 22environment for which the Claremont is known. 23During a recent tour of the Claremont, the facility 24looked exactly the same as when it opened. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS18 1 I strongly encourage the Board to approve -- 2 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 3 MR. GOLDBERG: Thank you. 4 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: You can finish your 5sentence. 6 MR. GOLDBERG: -- the Transformative Health 7Care of McHenry project. It is patterned after the 8Claremont and, as such, represents the future of 9health care. 10 Thank you very much. 11 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 12 Next, please. 13 MR. SCHAEFER: Good morning. 14 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And be sure you tell us 15your project so -- 16 MR. SCHAEFER: Yes. 17 Southern Illinois Gastrointestinal Endoscopy 18Center, Project 15-061. 19 Good morning. My name is Philip Schaefer. 20I'm the vice president and administrator for 21Southern Illinois Healthcare. We're a 22three-hospital system headquartered in Carbondale, 23Illinois. 24 I'm here to express opposition to this DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS19 1project and specifically to refute some of the 2claims made by the Applicant's attorney in 3communications during the project review. 4 The Applicant claims he needs to establish 5his own ASTC in order to retain his patients because 6SIH's employed physicians are penalized for 7referring SIH physicians [sic] to him for 8gastrointestinal services. That's not the case and 9I personally know of many referrals to 10Dr. Makhdoom's clinic from SIH physicians, including 11since he resigned from our medical staffs. 12 Each employed physician's contract with us 13states that patients may be referred to physicians 14outside of SIH by any patient's request, and no 15physicians are penalized in any such way for making 16referrals. 17 While the Applicant's attorney claims that 18Dr. Makhdoom treats all patients regardless of their 19ability to pay through the offer of free screenings 20and reduced cost-assist programs, these programs 21provide very little benefit to the residents of 22southern Illinois. 23 For example, his offer of 5 free 24colonoscopies a month to patients of a local health DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS20 1center provides a grand total of 60 screenings 2a year out of the 15,000 total colonoscopies that 3patients receive who reside in our area. 4 Those patients who do not have insurance and 5are not lucky enough to be one of the 60 must pay a 6$1500 fee if they qualify for his free colonoscopy 7assistance program. Last year only 10 percent of 8his patients received this discounted rate. 9 In her April 7th letter to the Board, the 10Applicant's attorney projects 5 percent Medicaid 11revenue and no charity care for the proposed 12facility while the existing ASTCs in the area have 13reported 19 percent Medicaid. Since 28 percent of 14our area residents are Medicaid recipients, the 15Applicant will provide very little care to our most 16vulnerable population. 17 Given the proposed payer mix for this 18facility, the Applicant's assertion that the program 19is designed to improve colorectal cancer screening 20rates in southern Illinois targeting uninsured and 21underinsured is a gross exaggeration. 22 Finally, unlike the Applicant, SIH and the 23SIH Medical Group provide care to all patients 24regardless of their ability to pay. We turn away no DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS21 1one because of inability to pay. We are safety net 2providers for patients who not only need 3screening -- 4 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 5 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Please conclude. 6 MR. SCHAEFER: -- who need screening 7procedures but also complex medical treatments of 8gastrointestinal abnormalities or complications. 9 Thank you. 10 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 11 Do you want to pass the mic? Make sure you 12get that close to your mouth so we can hear real 13well. 14 MR. MILLSTEAD: Hello. I'm with the same 15project. 16 Good morning. My name is Bart Millstead. 17I'm the administrator of Memorial Hospital of 18Carbondale, and I would like to express my 19opposition to the Southern Illinois Gastrointestinal 20Endoscopy Center project and comment on some of the 21claims that were made in the materials provided for 22this project. 23 First, Dr. Makhdoom resigned from the 24medical staffs at both Memorial Hospital at DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS22 1Carbondale and our sister hospital, St. Joseph's 2Memorial Hospital in Murphysboro, in 2015 when he 3elected not to fulfill the medical staff bylaws 4requirement that physicians who perform procedures 5in those hospitals must take emergency room and 6after-hours call. 7 In her May 16th letter to the Board, the 8Applicant's attorney stated that our hospitals would 9not allow him to see his own patients during call 10coverage and that he was not allowed follow-up on 11emergency patients he saw during his call period. 12 These assertions are completely untrue. 13Like every other physician on our medical staff, as 14long as he has privileges, he has the ability to see 15his own patients and to follow up with those 16patients during such call coverage times. 17 Secondly, the assertions that the project 18will not adversely impact any of the other health 19care providers in our area is also untrue. 20Dr. Makhdoom's resignation from our facilities' 21medical staffs and the relocation of his endoscopy 22caseload to his own practice has already had a 23significant impact on our facilities at SIH. 24 Lastly, as health care professionals, we're DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS23 1most concerned about the Applicant's apparent 2disregard for patient safety. The Applicant does 3not have and has not requested a transfer agreement 4with a hospital within 15 minutes of travel time of 5his facility, which is required for ASTC licensure. 6 His attorney stated in an April 7th letter 7to the State Board that the solution to the 8inevitable emergency is to simply call 911 and have 9the patient taken to the nearest emergency room. 10Dr. Makhdoom apparently intends to abandon patients 11in an emergency situation and not be part of the 12continuum of care. 13 Thank you. 14 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 15 Next. 16 MR. HALL: Good morning. I'm on the same 17project, 15-061. 18 Good morning. My name is Fred Hall, and I'm 19perioperative services manager at St. Joseph's 20Memorial Hospital in Murphysboro. I'm here to 21present testimony in opposition to the application 22submitted for the Southern Illinois Gastrointestinal 23Endoscopy Center. 24 I worked alongside the Applicant, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS24 1Dr. Makhdoom, for many years as both a nurse and a 2manager until he resigned his hospital privileges in 32015. In a letter that Dr. Makhdoom's attorney sent 4the Board during project review, she claimed that he 5resigned from SIH hospital staffs because he became 6concerned he would lose block time. The reality is 7that he had block time at two of our hospitals with 8regular block time at St. Joseph's four days a week 9for eight hours each day. 10 To further accommodate his endoscopy volume, 11St. Joseph's recently added two additional GI 12procedure rooms. During construction Dr. Makhdoom 13began to greatly reduce his surgical caseload at 14St. Joseph's and scheduled most of his patients at 15his office-based practice. Those patients that he 16did bring to the hospital were almost entirely 17Medicaid or uninsured. 18 Prior to his resignation, his block time was 19never reduced or reallocated. It remained open and 20available to him regardless of whether he used it 21or not. 22 The new rooms were completed shortly before 23his resignation, and since his resignation the 24GI procedure rooms at St. Joseph's operate DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS25 1significantly below target utilization. For 2Dr. Makhdoom's attorney to claim that the other 3hospitals have limited scheduling slots and cannot 4accommodate the volume that he can perform is 5untrue. 6 The statement that his facility will not 7impact other providers or health care facilities is 8also untrue, as his office-based facility has 9already had a very negative impact on my hospital, 10which will only increase if you approve the proposed 11project. 12 Thank you for allowing me the time to 13address my concerns today. 14 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 15 Jeannie. 16 MS. MITCHELL: The next five, please come up 17when called. 18 First is for Southern Illinois 19Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Center, Project 20No. 15-061, Joe Ann Troue. For that same project, 21Carole Klaine. Again for the Southern Illinois 22Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Center project, 23Cathy Blythe. 24 And for Northbrook Behavioral Hospital, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS26 1Project No. 16-011, Tina Cooper and Reverend 2Tom Beckstrom. 3 Please do not forget to sign in. 4 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: You don't have to sign in 5before you speak; just make sure you sign in before 6you leave the table. So whoever is ready can please 7start. 8 Somebody please start. 9 MS. BLYTHE: Hi. This is for Project 15-061, 10Southern Illinois Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Center. 11 Good morning. My name is Cathy Blythe, and 12I'm the system planning manager for Southern 13Illinois Healthcare in Carbondale. I'm presenting 14testimony in opposition to the Southern Illinois 15Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Center project. 16 As the staff report documents, the proposed 17ASTC is not necessary to improve access for health 18care services, it will result in an unnecessary 19duplication of services, and it will have a negative 20impact on other ASTCs and hospitals in the area that 21currently provide endoscopy services. 22 Of the nine licensed facilities providing 23endoscopy procedures in the target market area, five 24are operating significantly below target utilization DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS27 1levels. Physicians Surgery Center -- which is 2identified as Carbondale Clinic ASTC in the staff 3report located just minutes away from the 4Applicant's office which is the proposed site of the 5ASTC -- has a procedure room that is currently 6operating at 25 percent capacity as well as 7two operating rooms that are operating below the 8target occupancy level. 9 Additionally, hospital profiles for 2015 10document that St. Joseph's Memorial Hospital in 11Murphysboro, which is only seven minutes away from 12the proposed site, experienced 27 percent occupancy 13in its GI procedure rooms in 2015. 14 State Board rules permit only endoscopic 15procedures performed at a licensed health care 16facility to be used to justify the approval of a new 17ASTC. The application does not present a sufficient 18historic volume to justify the establishment of a 19new ASTC. 20 Additionally, the projected number of cases 21to be performed in the facility, based on historic 22procedures, will not justify the two procedure rooms 23requested. During the last two years, the Applicant 24only performed 462 procedures in a licensed health DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS28 1care facility. The remaining were done -- performed 2in his office, which the CON rules do not accept as 3justification for the need to establish an 4additional facility. 5 I respectfully ask the Board to take these 6facts into account when considering the application. 7 Thank you. 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 9 Next. 10 MS. COOPER: Hello. I am Tina Cooper, the 11director of resident services at Brookdale 12Northbrook retirement community, and I am here to 13speak on behalf of Project 16-011. I am here to 14testify today since my written letter of support was 15not previously considered by the Board. 16 For the 12 years that I have been the 17director of resident services in Northbrook, it has 18always been a struggle to obtain both inpatient and 19outpatient senior psychiatric care, specific for 20seniors. Often there are no beds available or not 21an appropriate bed available for the senior mental 22health. 23 The behavioral health unit in Des Plaines is 24small and most commonly full. That is our nearest DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS29 1facility. When available beds are available, they 2are not often nearby. I've had residents sent as 3far away as Hoffman Estates and Christ Hospital in 4Oak Lawn to receive treatment. 5 Continuity of care suffers when the care 6team, family, and local current physicians are not 7able to participate in care due to the senior being 8removed from their area. 9 A recent example of many situations I have 10seen -- I will call this person Marsha. She was 1174 years old and had three admissions to psychiatric 12facilities in less than two years. She was admitted 13to Evanston, Lutheran Geneva, and the last time 14admitted to Christ Hospital because no beds were 15available in the area. 16 Marsha had no family and her support system 17was not able to follow her progress well at Christ 18Hospital. She had no clothes there, no one 19available to take them that far to her, and she was 20forced to wear donated clothing while there, which 21further crushed her spirit. She tearfully said to 22me once while I spoke to her on the phone, \"I look 23like a homeless beggar.\" 24 Marsha had three different psychiatric care DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS30 1teams in less than two years, causing poor 2continuity of care, and varying medications which 3were changed by each new care team. No good plan 4ever resulted. It did, however, result -- 5 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 6 MS. COOPER: -- in her being admitted to 7assisted living and then a locked-down memory care 8facility with dementia patients -- 9 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: I need you to conclude 10your remarks. 11 MS. COOPER: -- where she, sadly, remains 12today. 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 14 MS. COOPER: Thank you. 15 REVEREND BECKSTROM: Good morning. My name 16is Tom Beckstrom. I'm the lead pastor at the 17Northbrook Evangelical Covenant Church, and I'm here 18in support of the Northbrook Behavioral Hospital, 19Project No. 16-011. 20 We are a relatively small congregation. 21I've been in Northbrook for six years. Whenever we 22see a need, we try to meet that need. I have been 23surprised at the number of times our church has been 24involved in the care of people with behavioral DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS31 1health issues. 2 There have been six teens or preteens and 3three young adults that have been related to our 4church in these six years. One experience, 5I received a text saying, \"Good-bye. Tell my mom 6I love her.\" My wife and I, while calling for help, 7were racing to her location where we were able to 8talk her to safety. 9 We took her out to dinner, so calmly as we 10talked, I said, \"You realize I have to take you now 11to the hospital.\" 12 She said, \"Thank you. I don't have the 13strength to go there by myself.\" 14 My wife and I sat with her half the night in 15the ER as we waited for a room, and for the next 16two days she sat in what is called a safe room from 17the operat- -- or from the emergency room until she 18was able to be transferred to a facility where they 19found a room for her. 20 I've also been called in by parents with 21kids who have been cutting themselves, harming 22themselves, abusing drugs, or attempting to take 23their lives in other ways. In all these cases we 24have ended up in the emergency room and then wait DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS32 1for a space where they could accommodate them. One 2time it was a horrific scene of a child setting 3himself on fire. 4 If our church of only 150 people has had 59 people in nine years that we have been in contact 6with, I can verify there is a need in the North 7Shore and we would welcome it in Northbrook. 8 I also believe in miracles. And one is you 9put a microphone in front of a pastor and say 10\"You've got two minutes,\" and I've said everything 11I needed to say. 12 Thank you for listening. 13 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 14 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: It's a miracle. 15 Next. 16 MS. KLAINE: Hi. My name is Carol Klaine, 17and I am a patient of Dr. Makhdoom, and I am here on 18behalf of his application for an endoscopy center in 19Jackson County, Illinois. 20 I can sum up my relationship with 21Dr. Makhdoom and -- he saved my life and it is a 22privilege to be here and speak with you on his 23behalf today. 24 I grew up in Jackson County, and I know that DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS33 1it is a very poor county. And, actually, it's the 2poorest county in the state of Illinois. I know 3that he serves many people that are underinsured or 4have no insurance at all and his generosity to each 5one of those patients in caring for them. 6 The project will support early diagnosis and 7treatment for colon cancer and allow Dr. Makhdoom to 8continue to provide the type of excellent care that 9I received from him. I can say that for myself. 10 Jackson County has a population of over 1160,000 with a median income of $33,000. Many 12members of our community are either uninsured or 13underinsured -- for example, they have insurance and 14high deductibles -- and I know him to be one to 15allow people to come in whether they have insurance 16or not. 17 He's a kind man and has shown the community 18and demonstrated many times how much he supports 19southern Illinois and the constituents that live in 20that area. I urge you today to vote yes on this 21project. 22 Thank you for your time. 23 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 24 Next. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS34 1 MS. TROUE: Good morning. My name is 2Joe Ann Troue, and I am a patient of Dr. Makhdoom's. 3I have been for about 15 years. 4 I have Crohn's disease; I've had it for 545 years. And he has taken care of me. I have his 6cell phone, if you can imagine, and he -- he has 7taken care of me. I mean, no matter what, when he 8was in the middle of dinner, whatever. He's a very 9caring person. He is -- he wants to care for the 10patient. That's his main objective, is to get the 11patient the help that they need. 12 He takes care of my whole family, and 13it's -- he's -- I'm just here in his behalf for 14Project 15-061. 15 And that's all I have to say. 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 17 Next, Jeannie. 18 MS. MITCHELL: The next five are all 19speaking on Project 16-011, Northbrook Behavioral 20Hospital, and they are Nancy Brown, Dr. Shiraz Butt, 21Anthony Bunin, Dr. Joe Troiani, and Dr. David Bawden. 22 Please sign in. You do not have to sign in 23before you begin speaking, just before you leave the 24table. And if you have written comments, please DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS35 1hand them to Mr. Constantino. 2 You can begin speaking. 3 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Please begin. You don't 4have to sign in before you begin. Just somebody 5grab a mic and let's go. 6 Thank you. 7 DR. BUTT: Good morning. My name is 8Shiraz Butt. I'm a psychiatrist and I'm practicing 9in the area for over 15 years. I'm speaking in 10support of the project, the Northbrook Behavioral 11Hospital. 12 And what I've come across is a severe 13shortage of services in the area. I've come across 14examples of patients and their families not being 15able to access severely needed mental health 16services. I have seen patients languish in 17emergency rooms because they were not able to find 18psychiatric beds. 19 And I know on paper sometimes you see there 20are a lot of psychiatric beds, but what these 21patients' needs are -- what these patients need are 22specialized services, and many times community 23hospitals are not able to meet their needs, so -- 24I'll give you a recent example of a 16-year-old DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS36 1autistic boy who had to wait two days in the 2emergency room. He had presented with severe 3aggression, was hitting himself, engaged in severe 4property destruction. And the emergency room was 5not able to find a bed for this child, and so they 6had to let the family go back home after medicating 7the child. 8 Now, these are patients who are at risk of 9harm to themselves and others. We're talking about 10suicidal patients, patients with addictions who need 11detox. And by not being able to provide services 12for them, we are not only placing themselves -- them 13at risk but also society at large. I also have 14numerous colleagues who have brought this to my 15attention, and I keep getting calls from them 16because they're not able to find psychiatric beds 17for their patients. 18 We also have a shortage in terms of 19continuity of care issues. So once the patient's 20discharged from the hospital, we're not able to find 21services close their home, and, as such, the 22families have to travel 50, 60 miles to either go to 23see a psychiatrist or go for other, less-intense 24services like intensive outpatient programs or DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS37 1larger hospital programs. 2 Also, we have seen that there is an overall 3increase in the -- 4 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 5 DR. BUTT: -- increase in the prevalence of 6mental disorders locally and nationally. 7 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 8 Next. 9 MS. NANCY BROWN: Hello. My name is 10Nancy Brown. 11 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: You're going to need to 12pull that much closer. 13 MS. NANCY BROWN: Hello. My name is 14Nancy Brown, and I'm the president of Meier Clinics 15Foundation, the business management services 16division of Meier Clinics. I am here in support of 17the Northbrook Behavioral health hospital in 16-011. 18 Meier Clinics has provided mental health 19care services in Illinois for 30 years in Wheaton, 20Northbrook, Geneva, and Chicago. We provide 21approximately 2400 outpatient sessions per month. 22 I am here representing Meier Clinics and 23Dr. Gary Casaccio, our medical director. He is very 24supportive of HealthVest's request for approval of a DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS38 1behavioral health hospital in Northbrook. I have a 2letter that Dr. Casaccio has signed. This letter 3was not previously recognized when letters of 4support were sent. 5 Some of Dr. Casaccio's letter includes the 6following information: \"It is not unusual for our 7patients to experience frequent delays in accessing 8inpatient care, often -- inpatient psychiatric 9care -- often due to bed shortages or lack of 10services.\" 11 US HealthVest is also known as a hospital 12who uniquely offers specific hospital-unit programs 13such as one specifically designed for military 14members who are struggling with posttraumatic stress 15syndrome or other emotional issues, a women's 16program specifically designed for women who have had 17trauma in their background, and a faith-based 18program for those who want to work on their physical 19and emotional aspects of care along with their 20spirituality. 21 Our staff solicited feedback from several of 22our medical and clinical staff. Together we 23reported that we have referred approximately 2466 people to inpatient care over the last 12 months. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS39 1This is not reflective of the total number we have 2referred, as we have over 50 clinical staff in 3Illinois, so the above is a very conservative 4figure. The estimated number of patient referrals 5over a 24-month period after the project is 6completed would conservatively be 122 people. 7 I encourage you to support the approval of 8US HealthVest's application -- 9 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 10 MS. NANCY BROWN: -- and are in complete 11support of it. 12 Thank you very much. 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 14 DR. BUNIN: Yes. Hello. My name is 15Anthony Bunin. I'm a psychologist in practice in 16the Chicagoland area for the last 15 years, 17providing services to -- care of psychiatric 18patients in the area and wanted to offer my support 19for Project 16-011. 20 My sentiments echo many of the sentiments of 21the other individuals. It turns out the lack of 22access for inpatient psychiatric beds and 23specialized -- the care of this particular 24population, which is a very specific population, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS40 1differentiated from other traditional psychiatric 2populations. 3 There's a significant lack of available 4beds, as other individuals have mentioned, 5oftentimes because individuals have to travel one to 6two hours to find placement at a facility and 7oftentimes now are using the emergency room as a 8conduit to provide psychiatric services for this 9population. 10 As such, there's a real lack of appropriate 11services, yet a need for access in the local 12communities for this very needy population, which is 13demographically the largest growing population of 14this -- certainly, the segment of the population 15that's growing substantially. 16 Just in terms of general information, 17there's been an 800 percent increase over the last 1810 years in the use of emergency rooms for general 19psych crises nationally due to a lack of specific 20inpatient beds for this population, so the need for 21specialized programming, for the understanding of 22the comorbid medical conditions that many of these 23elderly individuals present, it is -- is a desperate 24need of the community currently and would be DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS41 1serviced well through the support of this project. 2 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Next. 3 DR. TROIANI: I'm Dr. Joe Troiani. I am 4director of behavioral health programs for Will 5County health department. I also chair the Will and 6Grundy County LAN. It's a collaboration of 7community behavioral health providers in Grundy and 8Will County who have been meeting monthly since 9June of 1993. 10 I can't emphasize the critical shortage of 11psychiatric beds in the area. We maintain 12two crisis programs, and there have been weekends, 13for example, where the closest psychiatric bed for 14an adolescent was Champaign, Illinois, which is 15almost four hours away from us. This has resulted 16from the closure of psychiatric beds, dramatic 17downsizing since 1992. We've also had the closure 18of State psychiatric hospitals, Tinley Park. The 19other psychiatric hospitals have also seen a 20downsizing of beds and, of course, with the current 21fiscal crisis, the downsizing in capability. 22 What we don't want is the default mental 23health system to be the prisons. In Joliet they're 24going to be opening up the Joliet Mental Health DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS42 1Center, which is Illinois Department of Corrections. 2It will be a complete mental health facility. We 3don't need the emergency rooms and the prisons to be 4the default service providers. 5 And in my other hat I'm a retired commander 6of the United States Navy, having served 732 1/2 years. I'm critically aware of the shortage 8of psychiatric beds for those who have served or 9even those who are serving as well as their 10families. Yes, we have Great Lakes; yes, we have 11the VA center; but the ability to access services is 12quite a challenge because of the large number of 13people seeking services, so the availability of 14psych beds and specialty programs such as we have in 15Chicago Behavioral health hospital is of critical 16importance. 17 Thank you. 18 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 19 DR. BAWDEN: I'm Dr. David Bawden. I'm a 20psychiatrist. I've been in practice 40 years in 21the Chicago area, currently specializing in 22geropsychiatry. 23 I think personally, if we asked everyone in 24the room, \"Have you had someone -- a parent, uncle, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS43 1aunt -- who has had psychiatric problems, 2geropsychiatric problems?\" most of us would raise 3our hands. We've all had personal experience 4with it. 5 It's difficult to get enough beds. Even 6last night -- I have availability of 50 beds around 7the area. I could not get a geropsychiatric patient 8in any of my beds. About a year ago I started the 918-bed geropsychiatric unit at Chicago Behavioral 10Hospital, who are full most of the time. 11 I go to several nursing homes. There are 12always requests for admissions of patients with 13behavioral disturbances. I think that the 14demographics are very compelling. This is only 15going to become a larger and larger need as time 16goes on. 17 And, you know, it's -- first of all, you get 18your AARP card and you realize you're moving in that 19direction. Then you get on social security and you 20know you're really moving in that direction. 21 So, personally, we're all going to need 22these kind of services at some point, and it's our 23opportunity to try and build them out not only for 24our families but for ourselves. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS44 1 Thank you very much. 2 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 3 Next, please. 4 MS. MITCHELL: The next five will also be 5speaking on Project Kasia Murphy, Dr. Edgar Ramos, and Dr. Tony DeJoseph. 9 Please do not forget to sign in. You do not 10have to sign in before you begin speaking. 11 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Who are we missing? 12 Did you call five? 13 MS. MITCHELL: I did. 14 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Last chance. 15 DR. DE JOSEPH: Dr. Ramos had a medical 16procedure. He couldn't make it. 17 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Okay. Thank you. 18 MS. MITCHELL: Thank you. 19 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Please go ahead. 20 DR. DE JOSEPH: I'm Tony DeJoseph. I'm the 21CEO of Chicago Behavioral Hospital and -- 22 THE COURT REPORTER: Can you speak closer? 23I can't hear you. 24 DR. DE JOSEPH: Tony DeJoseph, CEO of DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS45 1Chicago Behavioral Hospital here in support of 2Northbrook Behavioral Hospital. 3 I want to talk about the environment right 4now for psychiatric care in Illinois. We're looking 5at cuts to a wide variety of outpatient and 6residential providers. We know that a strong 7infrastructure of community-based services decreases 8the need for inpatient beds, but we should be 9realists and realize we're not going in that 10direction; instead, the cuts to services that we've 11seen in Illinois are contributing to a trend of 12increasing inpatient need. 13 With the recent reductions in State-operated 14facilities, coupled with the effects of the 15Affordable Care Act and the advent of the new 16Medicaid MCOs shifting the population to more 17private sector providers, we're seeing a rise in 18need. Preceding this, overall since 1991 we've 19closed 1481 inpatient psych beds in Illinois. The 20current trend in need for inpatient beds will only 21continue to increase in this environment. 22 Lake County in particular has very few 23options for psychiatric care. There are only two 24facilities with a total of 75 beds in the entire DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS46 1county, which is far less beds per thousand 2residents than adequate. As with many areas of 3Illinois, local treatment is not available, and 4individuals from Lake County and the larger northern 5area of Illinois must travel long distances to 6receive inpatient psychiatric care. Lake County has 7lost beds with unit closures at several facilities 8in recent years, and there are also no specialty 9programs. 10 Another result of the decrease in 11psychiatric beds over recent years is the common 12complaint that emergency departments, law 13enforcement, jails, and prisons are compensating for 14the lack of availability of care. Our experience at 15Chicago Behavioral Hospital seems to demonstrate the 16need. We've gone from a virtually empty hospital a 17year and a half ago to a census that's been well 18into the hundreds, and we've often hit capacity in 19the various programs. 20 Finally, while there's a clear national 21trend of increase in the number of individuals 22needing psychiatric care, the National Alliance on 23Mental Illness estimates that 60 percent of adults 24and 50 percent of children -- DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS47 1 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 2 DR. DE JOSEPH: -- with a serious mental 3illness are not receiving treatment. 4 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 5 Next. 6 MS. MURPHY: Good morning. My name is 7Alfa Murphy, and I'm the practice manager for 8Associates in Behavioral Science, a psychiatric 9practice. 10 I should note I've been told that our letter 11of support was not accepted because it was signed by 12me rather than one of our physicians. We projected 13in that letter that we would refer approximately -- 14and this is only a number of the admissions that we 15have been able to -- for patients that we are unable 16to treat on our current basis -- 35 patients per 17month to Northbrook Behavioral Hospital who are from 18the zip codes in the Northbrook catchment area, for 19inpatient treatment. 20 We have been providing care to our patients 21for over 27 years. We are well aware of the need 22for more psychiatric beds and the need for 23Northbrook Behavioral Hospital in the Lake County 24area. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS48 1 Emergency rooms usually call upon us to 2accept patients for psychiatric care. Many times we 3are just not able to treat these patients as all 4beds are filled, leaving our patients in these 5emergency departments waiting for hours and 6sometimes days until discharges occur of the few 7available hospitals. 8 As a professional in the mental health 9field, we ask you to grant Northbrook Behavioral 10Hospital a CON to operate and provide the care many 11patients need. The care these patients need is 12urgent. Mental illness is sometimes pushed to the 13side of many of the social issues we face. I am 14here to tell you that mental illness has no 15boundaries, does not know social status, and it is 16the cause of many suicides in patients of all ages. 17Many of these illnesses can be treated rapidly, but 18we need the resources and we need these hospital 19beds. 20 Thank you so much for listening. 21 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 22 Next. 23 MS. WERESZCZYNSKA: Hello. My name is 24Kasia Wereszczynska, and over the last eight years DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS49 1I have provided clinical mental health counseling 2and crisis intervention to a culturally diverse 3population serving the South Side of Chicago and the 4North Shore area. I also have a history of working 5in various settings, including the mental health 6court system within the Cook County Jail, hospital 7emergency rooms, community mental health agencies, 8and both inpatient and outpatient psychiatric 9hospitals. 10 Throughout this time I have had the vast 11experience working with many helping professionals, 12institutions, and agencies. What I have come to 13notice, though, is that, despite everything 14currently in place -- the people, the buildings, the 15resources, the money -- or lack thereof -- the State 16of Illinois continually struggles to provide the 17type of care when and where necessary to our 18patients. 19 As a first responder, I have entered into 20unspeakable situations where I have only had moments 21to make an informed decision that may mean the 22difference between the patient receiving optimal 23services or those that are anything but. 24 Due to hospitals being over capacity, there DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS50 1have been many instances where patients with 2psychosis were forced to wait on a bed for inpatient 3or those with addictions were unable to get 4treatment when experiencing severe withdrawal or in 5need of detox. 6 There are other instances where, upon 7arrival to the emergency rooms, clerical errors have 8occurred. This took a toll on patients' already 9dire situations from terrible to worse. 10 Perhaps even more frustrating was the time 11when I called over 31 Chicagoland hospitals to place 12an adolescent child that was suicidal but had to 13resolve with sending her to the Pavilion in 14Champaign, which is three hours away. Clearly, 15something is not right with this situation. 16 I support the Northbrook Behavioral health 17project. Every patient deserves respect, 18compassion, integrity, and access to services. As 19such, this fine organization has the people, talent, 20resources, and so on to provide our patients with 21just that. Furthermore, it adds another location 22where patients -- 23 MR.

RANGANATHAN: Good morning, everyone. 6My name is Dr. Ranganathan, Thodur Ranganathan. 7I've been a practicing psychiatrist for about 828 years. 9 I think you've heard a lot of stuff that 10I probably wanted to share. In the interest of 11time, I'll say this: I have been involved in many 12aspects of what some of the other speakers have 13shared. 14 I've been in the system, the community 15system. I worked as a community psychiatrist for 16almost 24 years, the first 24 years of my career. 17The last four years, unfortunately, that's been my 18passion, but there's no more centers, especially in 19inner cities, south side of Chicago, where I used 20to get involved significantly. About four to 21five agencies that gather significant patients and 22families with illnesses disappeared. 23 Emergency rooms is the other thing. I've 24developed an emergency psych service of an inner- DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS52 1city hospital many years ago in conjunction with the 2State of Illinois to offer some meaningful, 3compassionate care, make sure the patients don't 4just wait in the ER. ER physicians typically don't 5have the expertise for other patients, and they 6don't want to be bothered with psych emergencies. 7 What I see now is the shortage -- and, 8again, when you look at numbers -- I kind of briefly 9looked at some numbers as far as hospitals and beds. 10My consensus is that there's about 35-, 36,000 total 11hospital beds in the state of Illinois, 200-plus 12hospitals. There's only about -- what? -- not even 1310 percent of psychiatric beds, number one. 14 The other thing is some of the community 15hospitals that do offer psychiatric beds, I think 16they're walking away from it typically because they 17don't want to be managing difficult patients, acute 18patients for several reasons, which I probably don't 19have the time to go into. 20 I think -- I've been in a couple of 21specialty hospitals. I recently joined Chicago 22Behavioral a few months ago. I've been part of 23another freestanding psych hospital, and these are 24the hospitals, I think, that would be able to offer DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS53 1the specialized care that our population needs, 2patients with significant mental illnesses. They 3need special things. You've heard about geriatric 4care; you've heard about the young adults, the child 5and adolescents, probably other specialty care, the 6veterans program. Women's mental health is 7absolutely critical and important. 8 I think some of the regular community 9hospitals probably don't have -- 10 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 11 DR. RANGANATHAN: -- the resources, and 12I would appreciate if you would consider the 13approval. 14 Thank you for the time. 15 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 16 Next, Jeannie. 17 MS. MITCHELL: The next five will also be 18speaking on Project No. 16-011, Northbrook 19Behavioral Hospital. 20 And they are Nancy David 21Sutherland, Donna Wattenberg, Ren\u00e9e Shopp, and 22Ellen Brown. 23 Please don't forget to sign in, but you do 24not have to sign in before you begin speaking. And DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS54 1if you have written comments, if you can please hand 2them over to Mr. Mike Constantino. 3 MS. CARSTEDT: My name is Nancy Carstedt. 4I am the executive director of the North Shore -- 5Cook County North Shore affiliate of the National 6Alliance on Mental Illness, NAMI. 7 Northbrook is one of the 17 communities in 8our catchment area, and I'm here this morning to 9strongly support the proposed 100-bed psychiatric 10hospital in Northbrook. 11 Recently I accompanied my disabled son to 12the emergency room at Evanston Hospital. While we 13were there, there were three security guards keeping 14watch over three patients who were experiencing 15acute symptoms of mental illness and were being held 16in the emergency room pending transfer to a 17psychiatric facility. One patient had been there 18over 48 hours, another nearly 36 hours, and the 19third over 6 hours. Their transfer was contingent 20on finding an available bed in a psychiatric 21facility. 22 During the time that my son and I were 23there, the patient who had been there for over 2448 hours was transferred to a psychiatric facility DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS55 1in the south suburbs of Chicago, nearly 40 miles 2away, making support of family members difficult, if 3not impossible. 4 Almost any day at any time, this is a common 5occurrence in the emergency rooms of the several 6hospitals in the northern suburbs of Chicago. There 7are simply too few psychiatric beds to meet the need 8for such beds. 9 In any given year, one in five adults will 10experience a serious mental health condition, many 11requiring hospitalization. Northbrook Behavioral 12Hospital would provide a much-needed option for the 13dozens upon dozens of patients needing immediate 14psychiatric services that are now being warehoused 15in local emergency rooms awaiting bed availability. 16During the past few years, we've seen 17two psychiatric units in our area in local hospitals 18close, only exacerbating the problem. 19 Mental illness is a treatable illness, much 20like cancer or diabetes. As with most illnesses, 21the more prompt the treatment, the more likely a 22successful outcome. While waiting in ERs, the 23patient receives no treatment and valuable time is 24lost. The voices become louder and more persistent DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS56 1in the schizophrenic's head. 2 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 3 MS. CARSTEDT: I urge you to support the 4Northbrook Behavioral Hospital project as a means of 5providing quality care in the northern suburbs. 6 Thank you. 7 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 8 COLONEL SUTHERLAND: My name is retired Army 9Colonel David Sutherland, and I'm a vocal advocate 10for veterans and military families across the 11nation, and I'm here in support of Northbrook 12Hospital. 13 The needs of our veterans and military 14families are evolving. They're not disappearing. 15And it's happening at a time when the American 16people are forgetting about the wars, and we cannot 17allow them to forget about the veterans and military 18families. 19 US HealthVest is changing the narrative 20that, when it comes to Illinois veterans and their 21families, specifically they don't have to be 22isolated to government programs that are not readily 23available in their communities. HealthVest is doing 24this through a culture driven by shared values with DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS57 1those that have served, an understanding of loyalty, 2respect, personal courage, and honor. 3 I have watched US HealthVest and facilities 4they've been associated with in communities across 5the country since 2010 after I returned from 6commanding 12,000 US service members and 745,000 coalition forces in -- during surge 8operations in Iraq, and I recognize that their 9outreach and their shared vision is one that will 10not tolerate another generation of homeless veterans 11or tolerate the status quo when it comes to the 1222 veterans a day that are committing suicide, the 13shortage of services and the fact that Illinois 14ranks No. 10 of the most populated states for 15veterans with more than 721,000 veterans living in 16your communities yet ranks 41st in services as a 17state, and some of these services include mental 18health. 19 The shortage in services is caused by an 20epidemic of disconnection between the military and 21civil society. It's an epidemic that drives a lack 22of or shortage of services in terms of health care. 23 Tom Young was an Army veteran living in the 24Chicago area who sought the VA help in dealing with DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS58 1suicidal thoughts. Tom called the VA hotline -- 2 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 3 COLONEL SUTHERLAND: -- seeking treatment, 4and the next day he committed suicide. 5 I urge you to support Northbrook. 6 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 7 And thank you for your service. 8 MS. ELLEN BROWN: Hi. My name is 9Ellen Brown. I'm a licensed professional counselor 10with Mental Health Solutions -- 11 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: You're going to need to 12pull that much closer. 13 MS. ELLEN BROWN: Oh. Sorry. 14 We're a therapy and counseling practice in 15Barrington and Mundelein. I'm delighted to be here 16today to represent our practice in support of the 17establishment of Northbrook Behavioral Hospital. 18I'm here to testify directly to the Board because my 19letter sent in support of Northbrook Behavioral 20Hospital was not recognized when the Board reviewed 21the letters. 22 During my time in practice, I've already had 23numerous experiences where clients have less than 24adequate access to mental health resources. I've DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS59 1had clients in crisis turned away from mental health 2care due to lack of available resources. I've had 3clients wait hours in emergency rooms before they 4could be seen, only to be told there were no 5psychiatric beds available. 6 Just waiting for hours in an emergency room 7can be traumatizing to any person, let alone someone 8suffering from anxiety, depression, or other mental 9health conditions. The wait time and traumatic 10experience is compounded by spending time in the 11general emergency room full of other patients with 12heart attacks and other serious mental -- medical 13problems. 14 An emergency room and hospital dedicated to 15mental health conditions would alleviate many of 16these issues. It's obviously frustrating for our 17clients, and as a counseling community it is 18extremely frustrating that we cannot provide the 19optimal care that our clients require and deserve. 20This is why it's so exciting to hear of the 21potential opening of the Northbrook Behavioral 22Hospital. 23 This would open up so much more access and 24timely access in an area that is so sorely lacking. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS60 1Not only will Northbrook Behavioral Hospital improve 2and expand upon access for mental health care but 3they will offer care for a wide spectrum of client 4types from adolescents to geriatric, women's focus 5groups, and even military clients. 6 It is my sincere hope that you will consider 7these facts and vote in favor of the establishment 8of the Northbrook Behavioral Hospital, help the 9community at large, and our counseling communities 10in particular will benefit from this. 11 Thank you. 12 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 13 Next. 14 MS. SHOPP: My name Ren\u00e9e Shopp. I'm a 15psychiatric nurse and practice manager for Mathers 16Clinic. My letter was not previously recognized by 17the Board. 18 Mathers Clinic is a mental health and 19substance abuse practice in Rockford, Woodstock, 20Crystal Lake, Elgin, and Fox Lake. We provide 21psychiatric services also to 15 assisted-living and 22nursing homes. 23 Our patients have experienced ongoing delays 24in accessing inpatient psychiatric care, mainly due DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS61 1to the lack of beds. There have been multiple times 2when patients have had delayed access to care, and 3an average admission can take me five to six hours 4looking for a facility. And if I'm looking for a 5client who needs a geriatric psychiatric facility, 6that might take me two to three days. 7 We currently have clients coming from 8Northbrook, Prospect Heights, Wheeling, Barrington 9Hills, Fox Lake, Grayslake, Gurnee, Highland Park, 10Ingleside, Island Lake, Lake Bluff, Libertyville, 11Mundelein, Vernon Hills, North Chicago, Round Lake, 12Waukegan, Buffalo Grove, and Zion and Niles. 13 This year our community mental health center 14closed in McHenry, and Mathers Clinic is now a 15community mental health center. We also opened an 16immediate care service so, instead of waiting two to 17six months for psychiatric care, clients can receive 18care the same day. 19 In order to continue providing the services, 20we need a place to refer, and we would really 21appreciate your consideration of the Northbrook 22Behavioral Hospital. 23 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 24 Next. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS62 1 MS. WATTENBERG: Good morning, Chairwoman 2and Board members. My name is Donna Wattenberg. 3I am past president of NAMI -- which stands for 4National Alliance of Mental Illness -- northwest 5suburban. My duties have been varied and many with 6the affiliate. I currently answer, for the last 7two years, our helpline, which extends into the 8northwest area. 9 I can, you know, read a list. Just to keep 10it short, we just celebrated -- NAMI northwest 11suburban -- our 30th anniversary. We're a 12well-established community. We are volunteer based. 13We are knowledgeable laypeople. We advocate, 14educate, and have support groups. 15 We, being NAMI northwest suburban, our board 16members, and my fellow community members all support 17the Northbrook Behavioral Hospital. 18 Please take into consideration that this 19hospital is well needed. There are consumers of 20mental health services in our local area that have 21been refused -- refused, I said -- admittance. Why? 22Because there's not enough beds. 23 These are cousins, sisters, brothers, 24mothers, fathers, uncles, aunts, et cetera, people DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS63 1like you and I being refused because there are no 2beds available. What's available is out of reach of 3many family members and loved ones', you know, 4traveling distance. 5 When the consumers of mental health services 6come through the ER, they are in need of immediate 7services. They are in need of immediate services. 8That's why they're in the ER room. 9 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 10 MS. WATTENBERG: I wish to let you know that 11our community does need this hospital. Thank you 12kindly for your time. 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 14 Next, Jeannie. 15 MS. MITCHELL: The next two will be speaking 16on Project 16-012, Transitional Care of Lake County. 17Please come up. Aaron Lawlor and John Lobaito. 18 And the next three will be speaking on 19Project 15-044, Transformative Health of McHenry, 20and please come up. Michelle Stuercke, Jennifer L. 21Bebinger, and Dr. Birinder Marwah. 22 Please sign in. Prior to signing in -- you 23can begin speaking before you sign in. 24 MR. LAWLOR: Good morning and thank you. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS64 1I'm Aaron Lawlor. I'm the chairman of the 2Lake County Board, and it's my honor to be here to 3support Project No. 16-012, Transitional Care of 4Lake County, Mundelein, and its establishment of a 5new 185-bed long-term care facility because it's in 6the best interests of the citizens of Lake County. 7 Lake County formerly operated Winchester 8House, which is currently located in Libertyville at 91125 North Milwaukee Avenue and is one of the oldest 10continuously operated facilities in Illinois. In 11keeping with Lake County's mission, Winchester House 12provides skilled nursing facility services, 13intermediate care services, and activities for the 14physical, mental, social, and recreational needs for 15the well-being of the elderly citizens of 16Lake County in a setting that is compassionate, 17loving, and a place to call home. 18 In order to preserve that mission for years 19to come, the Lake County Board and staff, as well as 20a special task force comprised of citizens, health 21care professionals, and board members, evaluated 22various options to make Winchester House a viable 23and financially self-sustaining entity in the 24future. We determined that the best solution for DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS65 1Winchester House was to transition its operation to 2a private company. 3 After an exhaustive and detailed selection 4process, the Lake Board chose Transitional Care of 5Lake County to lease and operate Winchester House 6with the goal of eventually to replace it with a new 7facility to provide continuing care to Winchester 8House's residents, decrease the taxpayers' financial 9obligations, and cease doing business in the nursing 10home industry. 11 As a part of the multiyear project, 12Transitional Care of Lake County applied for and 13received a new license, continued participating 14in -- 15 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 16 MR. LAWLOR: We ask for your support. 17 Thank you. 18 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you very much. 19 Next. 20 MR. LOBAITO: Good morning, Madam 21Chairwoman, members of the Board. 22 My name is John Lobaito. I am the Village 23administrator for the Village of Mundelein, and I am 24here on behalf of Mayor Lentz and the board of DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS66 1trustees. I'm here to express the Village of 2Mundelein's support for the Transitional Care of 3Lake County, Project 16-012. 4 Mundelein is a community of 32,000 people. 5There are no transitional care or long-term care 6facilities in the community. On February 22nd the 7concept plan for the facility was presented to the 8Mundelein Village Board at a public meeting. The 9proposal received overwhelming support from the 10Village Board. There were no negative comments on 11this project. 12 Since that time Innovative Health has been 13working closely with Mundelein and has invested more 14than a million dollars in the project to date. 15We're on track for approving the project by the 16year's end. 17 It should also be noted that the petition is 18for a new facility but, in reality, it is 19replacement of beds for the Winchester nursing home 20located in Libertyville adjacent to Mundelein. 21 The demographics of the area: There are 22more than 82,000 people in Lake County over the age 23of 65. There are more than 34,000 within 20 minutes 24of the proposed facility location. Mundelein alone DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS67 1has nearly 4,000 people over the age of 65. 2 So today I urge the Board's approval of the 3certificate of need that will ensure that there will 4be access to quality long-term care services for 5Mundelein and the surrounding area. 6 Thank you. 7 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 8 Next. 9 DR. MARWAH: Good morning, Madam Chairman 10and respected members of the Board. Thank you for 11allowing me this opportunity to speak today before 12you in support of Transformative Health Care of 13McHenry. 14 My name is Birinder Marwah. I'm a physician 15with board certification and training in internal 16medicine, geriatrics, palliative medicine, and 17hospice medicine. I have more than 30 years of 18experience taking care of geriatric patients in the 19Chicagoland area. Currently I'm chief of geriatrics 20at Advocate Masonic Medical Center. 21 I am here to encourage you to vote in favor 22of Project 15-044. I have known the Applicant for 23this project for six years and can speak to his 24ability and experience in developing and operating DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS68 1transitional care facilities like THM. 2 Good aesthetics, customer service, and 3state-of-the-art therapy are, of course, very 4essential ingredients at a skilled nursing facility; 5however, due to the increasing medical complexity of 6residents at these facilities, they need diagnostic 7and therapeutic medical care that is almost at par 8with what hospitals provide. 9 The Applicant and I have worked closely for 10four years in the past to develop and then actually 11implement such a model of care. This care model 12included mechanisms for comprehensive transfer of 13relevant clinical data both on admission and 14discharge of residents to these facilities, 15immediate availability of various state-of-the-art 16diagnostic modalities, sophisticated algorithms to 17monitor for side effects of medications, goal 18setting to monitor for progress, and access need for 19change in an ongoing treatment plan, and this is 20just a partial list of the unique model of care that 21both of us had run. Those four years that I worked 22with him were amongst the most fulfilling time in my 23professional career. 24 I strongly urge the Board to vote in favor DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS69 1of this innovative project. This community will 2immensely benefit from this project. 3 Thank you. 4 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 5 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 6 Jeannie. 7 MS. MITCHELL: The next five speakers will 8be speaking on Project 15-044, Transformative Health 9of OLSON: Anyone can begin. 13Thank you. 14 MS. RUGG: Good morning. My name is Lynette 15Rugg, and I'm the licensed administrator at 16Crossroads Care Center in Woodstock, Illinois. 17 I am here to voice my opposition to 18Transformative Care of McHenry's application. My 19opposition is directly related to the concerns that 20have already been identified by the Board and still 21have not been answered adequately by the Applicant. 22 They profess that the services they plan to 23offer will be above and beyond what is currently 24being provided in our facility; however, we have an DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS70 1in-house dialysis center, skilled therapy, including 2seven-day-a-week coverage, a designated short-term 3unit with newly renovated rooms, a private dining 4room area for this unit, both private and 5semiprivate rooms, and both private and shared 6bathrooms. 7 The Applicant has also falsely represented 8the investments that have been made into the 9physical plant of our facility by using the data 10from the annual cost reports that does not include 11the renovations we are currently doing as well as 12the rooms that have been redone since the last data 13has been reported. 14 The Applicant has recently provided the 15Board with statistical data regarding hospital 16discharge information that would lead you to believe 17there have been over 700 referrals made throughout 18our service area that were denied. 19 I can tell you that with respect to our 20facility that data is incorrect, inaccurate. Over 2180 percent of our residents have Medicaid as either 22a primary or secondary payer source. We do not deny 23patients. We still struggle to achieve an average 24occupancy of 75 percent. We do not deny patients. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS71 1 I must stress that our facility has invested 2a tremendous amount of time and resources into 3becoming a competitive -- being competitive, 4being -- becoming competitive in the market to 5service the short-term population in addition to the 6already existing long-term care population we have 7always serviced. Our financial viability relies 8heavily on maintaining and even growing a larger 9short-term census in order to balance out the 10revenue needed to remain financially sound. 11 The proposed facility will divert the 12cream-of-the-crop residents away from us and 13imbalance the playing field. 14 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 15 MS. RUGG: I urge you, as a result of these 16facts, to deny the Applicant's request. 17 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 18 Next. 19 MS. SURDICK: Hi. I'm Joyce Surdick and I'm 20here from Fair Oaks Health Care Center in 21Crystal Lake in opposition of the Transformative 22Care project, 15-044. 23 To understand the impact this project will 24have on the Crystal Lake and surrounding area DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS72 1nursing homes, you have to be aware of all the 2changes that are occurring in the Medicare program. 3We are currently participating in the bundled 4payment program. Basically, this program strives to 5improve the quality of care, but it also has 6expectations of much shorter lengths of stay. There 7are many rehab patients in our building for only 85 to 10 days. 9 These are not the only hospital bundles, but 10Fair Oaks is participating in 12 of their own 11episode bundles which across the board has 12expectations for shortened length of stays for 1356 different DRGs. The days of 25- to 30-day stays 14are long over. This is also the trend with Medicare 15Advantage programs and private insurance. 16 If Fair Oaks in our $4.4 million addition 17with private rooms and showers and the surrounding 18homes do not get these short-stay patients, we will 19not have enough patients to keep our buildings 20running. It is obvious, with the Centegra 21Hospitals' backing, the intention is to send the 22great majority of the rehab patients to the 23Transformative Care facility right on their own 24property. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS73 1 We will also be losing potential referrals 2as the Woodstock Centegra moves the majority of 3their operation to their new Huntley facility, which 4already has a brand-new Alden skilled nursing 5facility in the works. 6 To address the statistics from the Board 7staff -- the Board report for the predicted need for 8nursing home beds in McHenry County, it is 9imperative to realize that the private-pay nursing 10home patients of 10 years ago are now being cared 11for at assisted-living facilities which have sprung 12up at a rather alarming rate. At Fair Oaks our 13private-pay census averaged a little over 50 percent 14just five years ago; currently we average about 1525 percent. 16 There are predictions out in the field that 1725 percent of the lower-rated homes will end up 18closing. That number alone tells the story of the 19lack of need for a new facility in our county. In 20these changing times it is a fight to just -- 21 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 22 MS. SURDICK: -- just stay viable without 23the addition of new nursing home beds. 24 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Please conclude. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS74 1 MS. SURDICK: Thank you for your 2consideration. 3 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Next. 4 MR. WELDLER: My name is Mark Weldler and 5I'm here in opposition of Transformative Health of 6McHenry. 7 I'm here from The Springs at Crystal Lake, 8which is a 97-bed facility that is accredited by the 9Joint Commission. We just had our second 10deficiency-free survey in the last five years. We 11are a transitional care facility just minutes away 12from the proposed site. 13 We have an on-site dialysis unit. We have 14advanced programs to care for short-term 15rehabilitation, and more complex, higher acuity 16patients with all of the newest technologies 17available in laboratory and all other services that 18are there, imaging on the spot in order to ensure 19that we get the outcomes to get them home as quick 20as possible. 21 Our nurse staffing is double the state and 22national levels. Our therapist staffing is over 23four times the national and state levels. We're the 24facility that people go to when they don't want to DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS75 1go to a traditional nursing home. 2 We are now doing what the Applicant says is 3going to be the future of health care, and our 4length of stay is shorter in our records today than 5the Applicant proposes that they will have. We 6already have that. 7 The Applicant's referrals will be coming 8from Centegra Hospital. The Applicant states that 9the average length of stay in their facility will be 1028 days. Now, in order to meet the target 11utilization that the Board requires, that will be 12simple math. They will need 70 percent of the 13referrals coming out of Centegra Hospital, which is 14the hospital in our area that we all get referrals 15from, and that is the overwhelming place where we 16get them from. We get a little from other places 17but that's it. This is our hospital and we rely on 18this hospital for our majority. 19 To say that we are against competition would 20not be true. We did not oppose the other two 21faculties that have been approved that are not yet 22open. That are not open yet nor did the Applicant 23acknowledge those with their analysis of the market 24with regards to capital improvement, with regard to DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS76 1services, totally not there. 2 To be clear, this will not be competition. 3If this is approved, they will get those referrals 4and we will not. And I say this not from fear but 5from past experience. 6 The hospital had a financial -- 7 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 8 MR. WELDLER: I ask the Board to please 9consider the impact this is going to have on us, and 10the length of stay doesn't make sense and the 11information that they're presenting. Please. 12 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Please conclude. 13 MR. WELDLER: Thank you. 14 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Next. 15 MS. RANALLI: Good morning. My name is 16Clare Ranalli, and I am legal counsel for Florence 17Crystal Pines, The Springs, Crossroads, and 18Fair Oaks, who you've heard from here today. 19 I would like to just briefly touch upon a 20concern I have about the application which relates 21to the referral letters in support of the project. 22The Applicant did not comply with the Board's rules, 23which require that a referral letter state the 2412-month historical referrals and indicate where the DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS77 1referrals were sent and provide patient-by-zip code 2origin. 3 The Applicant said that it did not do this 4because of HIPAA, which, in my opinion, is baloney. 5All Applicants do it; all Applicants comply with 6their rules. Providing patient origin by zip code 7and saying \"10 patients went to The Springs or to 8Crystal Pines\" does not violate HIPAA. 9 That is critical information and it should 10have been provided, and the reason that it was not 11is it would make it very clear what the dramatic 12negative impact would be on the area facilities 13within 30 minutes of the proposed site, two of which 14provide the exact same services, subacute rehab, and 15many will -- and those have the same services that 16the Applicant says will set it apart, availability 17of dialysis, imaging, lab, et cetera. All of those 18services are already provided in existing four-star 19facilities in this service area. 20 Lastly, I just want to conclude by also 21stating I have an issue with the Applicant's claim 22that within two years, due to the increase of 23patients in the age cohort 65 and older, all 24facilities in the area will be at target DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS78 1utilization. 2 Historically, the facilities within 330 minutes -- and \"historically\" means over the past 4five years when there's been 10 percent growth in 5people age 65 or older -- have remained static with 6respect to their utilization. The numbers simply 7don't compute for some of the reasons that you've 8heard here today. 9 And, also, the Applicants did ignore the 10two facilities that have been approved that are not 11yet operating and the Manor Care facility which may 12or may not be approved. 13 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 14 MS. RANALLI: Thank you. I appreciate your 15time here today. 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 17 Next. 18 DR. LIYANAPATABENDI: Good morning, 19everybody. My name is Chool Liyanapatabendi. 20 I'm a practicing physician and practicing in 21hospitals as well as in nursing homes, including 22long-term care facilities and transitional care 23facilities and skilled facilities. 24 I have been in private practice for DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS79 1many years, and I am, as I said, a physician. In 2addition to that, I'm a medical director in several 3universities. 4 So I'm here completely in support of 5Transformation Health of McHenry. I want you to 6please understand -- and I heard everything what 7people are being told, and I wanted to be clear 8about what this facility is. 9 So this is not a skilled facility. This is 10a transform -- a transitional care facility. So 11what we hear all about the skilled facility -- 12I will give you a very simple example for you to 13understand. I'm -- as a physician, what -- my 14concern about my patients. 15 I'll give you one example of my Patient A, 16has congestive heart failure and has difficulty in 17walking and shortness of breath, had a hip fracture 18and went in the hospital and had a hip replacement. 19 And on the other hand, I have Patient B, 20same age, do not have complicated medical history, 21fell on ice, had a hip fracture and hip replacement, 22and now my decision where I'm going to send these 23two patients to rehab facility. 24 So my number one patient, A patient with DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS80 1complication, I really want to send this patient to 2a skilled facility because this patient cannot be 3able to do part of it in therapy because this 4patient already has heart failure, has other medical 5problems. So this patient needs to be clearly 6watched and clearly be taken care of. 7 But I -- on the other hand, my Patient B, 8without complicated medical history, this patient do 9not match into the skilled area. This is the 10patient that should go into the transitional care 11because this patient does not need the help -- 12 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 13 DR. LIYANAPATABENDI: -- and this patient 14can leave early, so I will support Transitional 15Care. 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 17 DR. LIYANAPATABENDI: Thank you. 18 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Next. 19 MS. MITCHELL: The next five will be 20speaking on Transformative Health of McHenry, 21Project No. 15-044. Please come up. Amanda Andrews, 22Ebony Scott, Matthew Thengil, Douglas Martin, and 23Elizabeth J. Kreplin. 24 If you have your comments written, please DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS81 1hand them to Mike Constantino. Please do not forget 2to sign in before leaving the table. You do not 3have to speak in the order in which you are called. 4Anyone can begin speaking. 5 MS. ANDREWS: Good morning, Madam Chairwoman 6and respected Board members. Thank you for allowing 7me the opportunity to speak today in support of 8Transformative Health of McHenry. 9 My name is Amanda Andrews, and I'm a 10licensed nursing home administrator for a 11transitional care facility and had the pleasure of 12working with the manager of this project for 13nine years. 14 When asked to speak on the benefits of this 15project, many thoughts came rushing to my mind. The 16first and foremost was that this project will create 17a modern-day inpatient rehabilitation center for the 18increasing number of baby boomers, something which 19the current PSA does not have to offer. 20Characteristically speaking, baby boomers are very 21particular in their research of products and what 22they invest in. They do not settle for ordinary. 23They want new and better. 24 Transformative Health of McHenry will meet DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS82 1all these criteria and more. THM offers a unique 2environment that will meet the individual needs, 3allow for choice in their care, and rehabilitate 4patients as quickly and safely as possible to return 5home to their lifestyle. 6 Think about yourself or your own family 7members. If I was assisting my baby boomer parents 8to look for a facility, I would not choose the 9traditional long-term care nursing home model, which 10many associate with the sick, frail, and elderly. 11I would want my parents among the younger, 12short-term patients who share the common goal of 13returning home. This can be done at THM, which 14offers a hundred percent private suites for a 15therapeutic recovery, call-to-order meals, state-of- 16the-art rehabilitation equipment, and modern-day 17medical equipment. This is truly a modern-day 18facility for the modern-day patient. 19 From my understanding, many of the opponents 20of THM are weary of this project because they feel 21THM will steal their patients and take business away 22from them. However, the marketplace THM is 23targeting versus the existing marketplace of 24current, long-term nursing homes is vastly different. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS83 1 In 2014 750 people went outside of the PSA 2area to find a facility that could meet their needs 3for rehabilitation because it didn't exist within 4the current area. Imagine THM keeping these 5750 people in McHenry. Jobs would be created, 6economy of local businesses would be stimulated, and 7the people of McHenry would stay in McHenry. These 8are all wins. 9 I strongly -- 10 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 11 MS. ANDREWS: -- encourage the Board to vote 12in favor of THM. 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 14 Next. 15 MR. MARTIN: My name is Douglas Martin. I'm 16the director of economic development for the City of 17McHenry and have worked for the City for nearly 1815 years. 19 I hold a master's degree in urban planning 20and policy from the University of Illinois at 21Chicago, and I'm a credentialed manager from the 22ICMA and a member of the American Institute of 23Certified Planners. 24 I am before you to express the City of DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS84 1McHenry's strong support for the Transformative 2Health Care project. My comments today focus on 3land use, economic impact, and community benefit. 4 Transformative Health of McHenry provides a 5much-needed and desired level of care into the 6existing continuum of care on our communities' 7911 hospital and health care campus. The location 8for this project is an approved health care district 9in the city of McHenry. 10 Projections indicate the total direct, 11indirect, and induced economic impact of this 12project during and through construction is 13$27.5 million. In addition, the annual operational 14economic impact is projected to be another 15$26.4 million. 16 The project is expected to address more than 17280 economic indicators for our community and have 18an aggregated economic impact of $53.9 million for 19the first full year of operations alone. The 20project will generate approximately 200 new jobs 21during construction and 150 full-time equivalent 22jobs once the facility is up and operational. 23 Transformative Health of McHenry will 24provide a unique, specialized, state-of-the-art DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS85 1facility, enhancing the health care services of the 2city and McHenry County. Aging statistics and 3projections for our county support the need for 4transitional projects such as this. 5 In conclusion, Transformative Health of 6McHenry is consistent with the City of McHenry's 7land use goals, provides an additional quality of 8life continuum of care benefit, and necessary 9services within the City's planned health care 10district and an aggregated economic benefit of 11$53.9 million. 12 On behalf of the City of McHenry, we urge 13your yes vote for this beneficial and worthwhile 14health care project. Thank you for bringing these 15services to our community. 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 17 Next. 18 MR. THENGIL: Good morning, Madam Chairwoman 19and respected members of the Board. Thank you for 20allowing me the opportunity to speak before you 21today and in support of Transformative Health of 22McHenry. 23 My name is Mat Thengil, and I am the 24director of therapy services for a transitional care DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS86 1facility. I am an occupational therapist with over 214 years of experience. I would like to speak 3directly on the benefits of this innovative model 4and how it differs from a skilled nursing facility 5due to the short-term rehab. 6 Unfortunately, many skilled nursing 7facilities today often create a loss of independence 8and instill an institutional feeling with their 9clientele. This is because they provide primarily 10long-term care services and then attempt to make 11short-term rehab patients fit the long-term care 12patient populations. 13 There is not a lot of choice for these 14residents when it comes to their food, rooms, and 15partnership with therapy. A nursing home feels 16institutional, and people seem to lose their sense 17of self-worth and feel as though they give up a lot 18of their privacy and independence once they enter 19the traditional nursing home. Projects like this 20one give folks alternative choices that promote 21recovery from illness, function, and independence. 22 For the last several years, there's been 23greater scrutiny from CMS on lengths of stay and how 24reimbursement is provided. New models of DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS87 1reimbursement such as bundled payments were created 2to increase efficiency and decrease waste. Projects 3like Transformative Health of McHenry provide those 4efficiencies and ultimately save the government 5money. 6 Transitional care facilities like this 7project have proven to have shorter lengths of stay 8than the shorter-term rehab of a skilled nursing 9facility. This allows the patients to return home 10safely and independently much sooner by taking 11advantage of seven days a week of therapy, state-of- 12the-art equipment, multiple sessions of therapy 13throughout the day, home safety evaluations, and 14community reintegration tasks. 15 The goal of this program is to not only 16rehabilitate our patient but to allow these patients 17a better opportunity to prevent illness and avoid 18future hospitalizations. 19 I strongly encourage the Board to vote in 20favor of Transformative Health of McHenry. Patients 21and the government will benefit. Thank you. 22 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 23 MS. KREPLIN: Good morning, Chairwoman and 24respected members of the Board. Thank you for this DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS88 1opportunity to speak in support of Transformative 2Health Care of McHenry. 3 My name is Elizabeth Kreplin. I'm a 4lifelong learner and have professional experiences 5in business and health care. It has been an honor 6and privilege to provide care as a registered nurse 7for the last 16 years. 8 My first nursing experiences were in home 9health, followed by four years in a nursing home 10from a staff nurse to director of care delivery. 11The last five years were as director of nursing of a 12new transitional care facility, hired by an owner/ 13operator of the THM project. I was privileged to 14work under his vision for patient-centered care with 15high-acuity patients in a transitional health care 16setting. We hired nurses with stellar clinical and 17critical thinking skills dedicated to a culture of 18respect and individualized patient care, providing 19ongoing patient assessments and personalized 20education. 21 We were consistently rated a CMS five-star 22facility, Joint Commission certified, and provided 23advanced medical practice protocols and programs as 24well as state-of-the-art therapy. Continuity of DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS89 1care from admission to discharge resulted in reduced 2length of stay, reduced 30-day rehospitalization, 3and enhanced patient satisfaction with optimal 4function and timely recovery. 5 In my professional opinion and experience, 6nursing homes with short-term rehab may be an 7attempt at transitional care. They are not a 8comprehensive solution. Transitional care is, 9indeed, transformative, not only as it serves 10patients but for its innovative impact on the health 11care industry. 12 I strongly encourage the Board to vote yes 13in favor of this innovative project, No. 15-044. 14Thank you. 15 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 16 Next, Jeannie. 17 MS. MITCHELL: The next five, also speaking 18on Transformative Health of McHenry, Project 19No. 15-044, please come up. Bernie Powers, 20Lisa Ulm, Henry J. Ecker, Mary D. Tichelbaut, and 21Kimberly Boike. 22 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Go ahead. 23 MS. ULM: Good morning. Thank you for 24allowing me the opportunity to speak before you DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS90 1today and in support of Transformative Health of 2McHenry. 3 My name is Lisa Ulm. I am a licensed 4nursing home administrator and have worked in the 5skilled nursing and transitional care sector for the 6last 15 years. Over the last six years I have 7opened four and personally managed and directed the 8stabilization and daily operations for three 9transitional care facilities like this project. 10 I would like to speak to my experience 11regarding the impact projects like this have on a 12marketplace. Facilities like Transformative Health 13of McHenry not only fill gaps in the continuum of 14care, they seem to act as catalysts that spark a 15positive chain reaction of improved health care 16services across the market. As other area providers 17up their game, access improves, surveys gets better, 18managing return to hospitalizations improves, and 19capital gets reinvested in aging properties. All 20this ultimately benefits the patients and their 21families. 22 Another phenomenon that I have witnessed is 23that transitional care facilities can actually 24create a new demand for their services in the DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS91 1market. I think this is due to two primary reasons. 2One, access improves by decreasing restrictive 3admissions practices, and, two, patients who may 4have bypassed a traditional nursing home are willing 5to admit to a transitional care facility for 6rehabilitation. 7 In 2011 I opened and operated a short-term 8care facility with the managers of this project and 9entered a very established market. Over a six-year 10period there was not a single facility closure. In 11my opinion, adding this state-of-the-art facility 12required the surrounding facilities to improve the 13quality of their physical plant and overall service, 14which most assuredly resulted in a better experience 15for health care consumers in our area regardless of 16which facility they chose to provide their care. 17 In conclusion, I strongly encourage the 18Board to vote yes in favor of this much-needed 19facility for the people of McHenry. Thank you. 20 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 21 Next. 22 MS. POWERS: Good morning, Madam Chairwoman 23and respected members of the Board. Thank you for 24allowing me to have the opportunity to speak before DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS92 1you today in support of Transformative Health Care 2of McHenry. 3 My name is Bernadette Powers, and I am a 4director of food services in health care with 537 years in management experience. I have lived 6here in McHenry County for almost 30 years, 26 of 7those years in the town of McHenry, and I've seen 8this community grow up from a sleepy little river 9town to a vibrant community. 10 I'm here to encourage you to vote in favor 11of Project 15-044 as we need to provide transitional 12care for short-term patients, especially those under 13the age of 60. 14 The hospitals in the area understand that, 15in order to attract people to our community, both 16patients and high-quality health care providers, 17they need to compete with those high standards of 18health care closer to the city. They knew that they 19needed a state-of-the-art health care facility that 20could support what people deserve, the same quality 21of health care they were getting in more affluent 22areas closer to Chicago. 23 Now we need to do the same for short-term 24patients in transitional care, as it does not exist DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS93 1at present. I know of a lot of facilities that say 2that they can take care of younger, short-term 3patients by putting a few rooms aside or even a 4hallway designated for this use. But if you are a 5long-term facility, this is very hard to do, and it 6requires a different focus to their primary mission. 7 Presently I drive 40 miles, a three-hour 8round-trip commute to work with a team of 9professionals that truly understand the meaning of 10hospital-to-transitional care-to-home model, 11catering to the needs of patients that require a 12fast recovery and return to their normal lives as 13soon as possible. You may think this is crazy to 14drive this far -- 15 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 16 MS. ULM: -- but I -- 17 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Please conclude. 18 MS. ULM: -- but I urge you that this is 19very vital to the community, and I hope you approve 20it. Thank you. 21 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 22 Next. 23 MS. TICHELBAUT: Good morning, Madam 24Chairwoman and members of the Board. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS94 1 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Can you pull that closer 2so we can hear you? 3 Thank you. 4 MS. TICHELBAUT: My name is Mary Drislane- 5Tichelbaut. Thank you for allowing me to speak 6before you today. I am here to speak on behalf of 7McHenry Transformative Health Care facility. 8 On February 3rd, 2016, I broke both of my 9knees due to a freak accident fall in my own home. 10After spending three days at Lutheran General 11Hospital, I was told that my needs would best be met 12in a short-term rehab facility. 13 The search began for a facility. Of course, 14not having any need to use so before, the Google 15search began. I found a facility in Niles, 16Illinois. Before arriving at my TCF, I was sure 17that I was not going to like this place because of 18the stigma of what I thought it was going to be. 19The website and various reviews were all very 20positive in regard to this facility, so I figured 21I would be okay. 22 Wow, was I wrong about my initial feeling. 23Upon my arrival I was made to feel like I was a 24guest in a hotel, not a hospital patient. The staff DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS95 1was very welcoming, kind, and generous to me. 2I felt like I was a human being, not just a number. 3I felt loved and treated with kindness and respect. 4 All the staff members knew me by my name 5whenever they saw me. That was such a personal 6touch to me. The private rooms with large flat- 7screen televisions, table and chairs, mini fridge, 8and loveseat all made my room seem like a hotel 9room, not a hospital room. 10 I received the best transitional care 11treatment through the help of my CNAs and nurses who 12were always looking out for my safety as well as my 13comfort. 14 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 15 MS. TICHELBAUT: At this point I can only 16say the therapists I had also were very -- 17 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: I need you to conclude. 18 MS. TICHELBAUT: -- conscientious, and 19I feel the need for a facility like this is much 20needed in the McHenry area. 21 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 22 MS. BOIKE: Good morning. My name is 23Kimberly Boike. I'm presenting testimony in 24opposition to Project 15-044, Transformative Health DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS96 1of McHenry, on behalf of Manor Care Health Services, 2LLC; HCR Healthcare, LLC; HCR Manor Care, Inc.; and 3Manor Care Health Services-Libertyville, LLC. 4 On November 13, 2015, the Circuit Court of 5McHenry County reversed this Board's decision 6denying Manor Care's proposed project to construct a 7130-bed skilled nursing facility in McHenry County 8and issued an order instructing this Board to issue 9a CON permit for the Manor Care project. This Board 10has appealed that decision, which appeal is 11currently pending. 12 Because the planning area bed need in 13McHenry County should be considered after Manor 14Care's project approval is finalized, this Board 15must deny the Transformative Health project. 16 Further, if this Board believes that the 17negative information supplied by Transformative 18Health regarding existing providers constitutes a 19good reason to overlook Transformative Health's 20inability to comply with the criteria noted in the 21staff report, then this Board should deny the 22Transformative Health project, follow the direction 23of the Circuit Court to approve the Manor Care 24project, and withdraw its appeal of the Manor Care DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS97 1project. 2 Thank you. 3 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 4 Next. 5 MS. MITCHELL: The last two individuals will 6also be speaking on Transformative Health of 7McHenry, Project No. 15-044. First is Mark -- 8either Jamer or James. The second individual is 9Larry Banks. 10 MR. JAMES: Good morning. My name is 11Mark James and I'm the business office manager at 12Crystal Pines Rehabilitation & Health Care Center. 13I'm here to oppose the Transformative Care project 14primarily for -- I want to speak to a couple of 15issues. 16 First, at the last minute, the Applicant 17sent in a chart that they presented as CMS 18information purportedly to show referrals to various 19facilities that were denied, attempting to claim 20that facilities deny 50 percent of the referrals. 21 There are a number of problems with this 22chart. First, the chart is missing two facilities 23in the area that had substantial admission from this 24hospital. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS98 1 Second, CMS can only track information on 2traditional Medicare A-billed patients, which the 3chart does not include admissions to area providers 4whose stay in the hospital that was paid for by 5Medicare Advantage, commercial insurance, Medicaid, 6or private pay. 7 Third, they show a column representing 8referrals from the hospital and want you to believe 9this is CMS data. This is not, as CMS does not 10track referrals from hospitals, only admission to 11these. The table/chart is, quite frankly, false and 12a complete distortion of information. 13 As the business officer manager at Crystal 14Pines, it's my job to approve people that are 15referred. We do not deny 48 percent of people who 16have been sent to us by -- for referrals by 17Centegra. What happens is a lot of times a 18patient -- a case manager will send it out to 19multiple facilities at the same time. That is the 20only way that they could come up with that kind of 21information with respect to Crystal Pines. Our 22referral refusal rate would be somewhere below 2310 percent. 24 My next point is to address the Applicant's DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS99 1claim that despite taking anywhere from 30 to 280 percent -- depending on which of their numbers 3you use -- of the current referrals from area 4facilities, it will not matter because within the 5next year and a half to two years this project and 6all area facilities will be at target utilization 7due to population growth in the age cohort -- 8 MR. ROATE: Two minutes. 9 MR. JAMES: Thank you for your time. 10 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 11 Next. 12 MR. BANKS: Hi. My name is Larry Banks, and 13I'm here in opposition to Project 15-044. 14 I'd like to start by saying there's 15two facilities that have been approved in the area 16that are currently going to open, which will already 17be negatively impacting the facilities. 18 Secondly, it's talked again and again about 19a transitional care facility. A transitional care 20facility is a licensed skill nursing facility. 21That's the only thing that there is. So to say it's 22not a skilled nursing facility or it's not a 23trend -- a typical facility -- it is not true. 24 I can give you an example of another DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS100 1facility that is probably a mile from the current 2proposed site, The Springs at Crystal Lake. There's 3nothing institutional about that center. It is 4100 percent transitional care. They only take 5short-term rehab patients and no long-term care 6patients. It is a beautiful facility, recently 7renovated, and has 65 percent occupancy. That is 8not due to the fact that people aren't choosing it. 9It's due to the fact that there are not people to 10fill it. 11 This facility is not going to be built in a 12medically underserved area. There are more than 13enough beds in the service area. If they really are 14going to address a need, why are they building a 15limited-access facility in the middle of an area 16that is already a densely bedded area? 17 They say that we are going to steal -- 18we're -- the facilities in the area feel that 19they're going to steal patients. It's not that 20there's patients to be stolen. The numbers that 21mark this at 750 patients is not true. It is not 22the CMS information, it shouldn't be represented as 23CMS information, and I think it's terrible that they 24would have a misrepresentation like that in their DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS101 1application. 2 There are many modern-day facilities in the 3area.

CONSTANTINO: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 20 Park Pointe South Elgin Healthcare & Rehab 21Center is requesting the third permit renewal for 22this project. 23 The renewal is for 24 months, until May of 242018. The original project was approved for DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS104 1120 beds at an approximate cost of $21.7 million. 2 Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 3 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 4 Questions by Board members? 5 MEMBER GREIMAN: Yeah. 6 What -- what changes are being made to -- so 7that you can be -- with your dollars -- the 2010 and 82016 must have a significant economic difference. 9Doesn't it? 10 MR. CONSTANTINO: When it was originally 11approved, Judge, it was -- they were going to use 12financing from the County -- 13 MEMBER GREIMAN: Yeah. 14 MR. CONSTANTINO: -- bonds from the County, 15and that fell through. Subsequently they've come 16forward and found additional financing, and that's 17been the biggest cause of the delay. 18 MEMBER GREIMAN: I understand. I appreciate 19that. That was in your report. 20 My question is, when was the loss -- the 21extra costs. 22 MR. CONSTANTINO: Oh, there's been no extra 23costs. 24 MEMBER GREIMAN: You mean they're DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS105 1charging -- they're working on the 2010 numbers? 2 MR. CONSTANTINO: That's correct. As they 3reported to us, yes. 4 MEMBER GREIMAN: Is that right? 5 MS. WESTERKAMP: That is correct. The 6original financing was through bonds, and bond 7financing can be very expensive. And we are now 8using private funds and private financing so the 9cost -- 10 MEMBER GREIMAN: I understand that. But the 11contractors, the subcontractors that are going to be 12working on this thing, are they charging the 2010 -- 13 MS. WESTERKAMP: Actually, they are working 14off the 2010 budget and they've accepted that. 15 MEMBER GREIMAN: They are? Okay. 16 That's what I wanted to know. I wanted to 17be sure. 18 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So I have a question. 19 So at this point no dirt has been moved? 20 MS. WESTERKAMP: No dirt has been moved. We 21are ready to break ground on August 1st. We wanted 22to actually -- because of the recoveries on bonds, 23not being able to obtain the letter of credit with 24the State that expired, we went to private DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS106 1financing, and we didn't want to break ground until 2we had all the private financing funds actually 3secured in our account. We didn't want to start a 4project and have to be in the position that we were 5still trying to raise funds. 6 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: I understand. But 7I guess my concern is partially that these beds have 8now been taken out of the bed count. By the time 9you open, it will be for eight years that the beds 10have been tied up with all of the delays. 11 Michael, the project was originally approved 12in 2010? 13 MR. CONSTANTINO: That's correct. 14 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And the most recent 15completion date is 2018; right? 16 MR. CONSTANTINO: They're requesting a 17completion date of May 2018, that's correct. 18 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So eight years that beds 19have been out of the inventory. 20 MR. CONSTANTINO: That's correct. 21 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And not one shovel of 22dirt has been moved? 23 MR. CONSTANTINO: That is correct. 24 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Can you explain exactly DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS107 1what the financing is now? 2 MS. WESTERKAMP: The financing is secured 3through DB5 investors which are private investors. 4These are foreign investors who bring funds to the 5United States through various types of banks and 6whatnot. 7 And the benefit of having those investors is 8that this is -- this is basically an interest-free 9financing, so the cost of the project remained very 10low and no monies are paid for accrued interest. No 11monies are paid for -- profits aren't distributed 12until after the project is stabilized. 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And what is your level of 14confidence that you will meet this May of 2018 15completion date? 16 MS. WESTERKAMP: We are ready to break 17ground August 1st. We have our architecture 18plans -- everything is in place. When we talk about 19shovel ready -- I know that's a term that's thrown 20around all the time. Everything's shovel ready. We 21are -- the land developer is actually ready to put the 22shovel in the ground. And he would have done it a 23month ago, but we've been waiting to get the approval. 24 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So you're 50 percent DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS108 1confident? 75 percent? 2 MS. WESTERKAMP: I am a hundred percent 3confident that we'll be ready by May of '18. 4 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Other questions? 5 (No response.) 6 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Seeing none, I'll ask for 7a roll call vote. 8 MR.

ROATE: Thank you. 5 Madam Chair. 6 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: I'm actually going to 7vote no. 8 I don't see this being done in May of 2018, 9and I don't like the fact that these beds have been 10tied up. It will be over eight years by the time we 11get things done -- I'm going to guess close to 12nine years -- so I vote no. 13 MR. ROATE: Thank you, Madam Chair. 14 That's 5 votes in the affirmative; 1 vote in 15the negative. 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: The motion passes. 17 Good luck. 18 MS.

This project was originally 15approved as a replacement facility for a 111-bed 16skilled nursing facility with a 200-bed replacement 17facility at a cost of approximately $24.9 million. 18 The first alteration increased the gross 19square footage by 4.3 percent for about 4500 gross 20square foot.

CONSTANTINO: Are you talking about 7projects approved, that have been approved and not 8yet operational? 9 MEMBER GREIMAN: Yeah. 10 MR. CONSTANTINO: Yeah, it's included in the 11station need calculation. Once you approve it, 12they're immediately taken out of the need. 13 MEMBER GREIMAN: I see. They are? Because 14I see that DaVita has a number of pending issues, 15and I wonder if -- how much that changes the 16establishment of it. 17 If you look at page 4 of the staff report, 18you see about 10, 12 pending projects. 19 MR. CONSTANTINO: That's correct. 20 MEMBER GREIMAN: That seems to be a lot of 21projects. How come you've not finished with them? 22Why is it taking so long to finish these projects? 23 Not you. 24 You. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS118 1 MR. CONSTANTINO: Thank you, Judge. 2 MR. SHEETS: Well, Judge, the way the need 3is calculated for these types of facilities 4basically revolves around people that have a certain 5stage of the renal disease that will progress at 6some point to where they need dialysis. 7 So in dialysis it's really a planning 8activity. We're planning two years down the road -- 918 months to two years down the road -- for where 10the patients are and where we think the need 11calculation will be. 12 MEMBER GREIMAN: So -- okay. So when we 13give you a right -- authority to have a facility, 14you don't necessarily move on it because you're 15waiting to see what's going on in the market; is 16that right? 17 MR. SHEETS: Well, we do move immediately on 18it, and it takes -- you know, it takes time to get 19the building. Sometimes it's a new building; 20sometimes it's a rebuild. 21 MEMBER GREIMAN: I understand but it's -- a 22real market. You guys -- you and somebody else -- 23own 90 percent of the renal stations in Illinois so 24you have -- I'm sure you have it down pretty well.

Those are the fun ones. 10 But on -- if we say that the construction 11and contingencies are high compared to our standard, 12how are we able to -- how can we find that that's 13not negative? I just want to make sure that's -- 14I mean, I -- 15 MR. CONSTANTINO: When I looked at that, it 16was high on the -- on what they considered to be the 17clinical portion of the project, but when I compared 18it to the other approved medical office building 19projects, it was in the range that we have approved 20in the past and accepted. 21 And the second reason we didn't have a 22negative finding on it was because they have 23financing already in place and they provided us with 24a signed document.

The anticipated completion 19date is December 31st, 2017. 20 There was no public hearing, there was 21opposition, and we did have findings. 22 I would like to note, though, one comment 23that was made during the public participation, that 24to be -- if you do approve this as an ASTC, they DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS127 1cannot have that license without a transfer 2agreement with a hospital. IDPH -- 3 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And it's not currently in 4place? 5 MR. CONSTANTINO: IDPH will not give them a 6license without that transfer agreement. 7 MEMBER GALASSIE: Explain the transfer 8agreement. 9 MR. CONSTANTINO: It's a transfer 10agreement -- if they have problems during the 11procedures performed at the ASTC -- with the 12hospital. And there's two hospitals within 1310 minutes of the proposed site. 14 MEMBER SEWELL: I didn't hear your answer to 15the Chairman's question. 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: It's not in place. 17 MEMBER SEWELL: Oh, it's not in place. 18 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Is that correct? It's 19not -- there's no transfer agreement? 20 MR. SHEETS: Well, there's no ASTC so there 21can't be a transfer agreement. 22 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So, it's a chicken-or-egg 23thing? 24 MR. SHEETS: Right. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS128 1 MEMBER GALASSIE: So would we want to amend 2our motion to having that agreement in place? 3 MR. MORADO: They won't be able to receive 4the licensing from IDPH without having something 5like that in place, so it's a function that would 6happen after they are either granted or denied 7the CON. 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Because we've had a lot 9of ASTCs here before, and I've never -- did they all 10have transfer agreements? 11 MR. CONSTANTINO: Oh, to get the license 12they had to have it. 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: No, no, no. I mean 14before we approved them. 15 MR. CONSTANTINO: No. That's not one of 16our -- 17 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So no one has ever 18had it? 19 MR. CONSTANTINO: Not at the time -- they 20did not submit a transfer agreement as part of our 21application for permit. It's not a requirement. 22 But during public comment that issue was 23raised, and I'm just pointing out that, if you 24approve this project as an ASTC, they cannot get DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS129 1that license without that transfer agreement being 2in place. 3 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: But that's the function 4of IDPH and not this Board? 5 I'm sure you have some comment. 6 MR. SHEETS: Well, I do briefly. But 7I think I understand what Mr. Constantino is saying, 8and I would wholeheartedly agree with that. There 9are a lot of different licensure requirements, and 10one of them is a transfer agreement. So all of 11those would have to be met before the facility is 12licensed. 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Well, the only reason 14that's an issue right now as opposed to the other -- 15how many ever million we've looked at -- is because 16in public comment that was brought to light. 17 MR. CONSTANTINO: Yeah. We received, from 18the Applicants, about re- -- that if there was a 19problem, that the Applicant would just call 911. 20Well, you can't do that if you are a licensed ASTC. 21You have to have a transfer agreement with the 22hospital. You can't have that license without that 23transfer agreement. 24 During public comment that issue was DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS130 1brought up. 2 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: I understand. 3 MEMBER GOYAL: Madam Chair, may I ask a 4question? 5 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Sure. 6 MEMBER GOYAL: Mr. Constantino, is the rule 7for transfer agreement 30 minutes, or is there a 8different time period for -- 9 MR. CONSTANTINO: I couldn't tell you, 10Doctor. 11 MEMBER GOYAL: Would it be a reasonable 12thing for the Board -- of course, I don't vote -- to 13make their recommendation subject to the transfer 14agreement even though it's another agency that has a 15rule? 16 MR. CONSTANTINO: What -- what I -- 17 MR. MORADO: I think I -- go ahead, Mike. 18 MR. CONSTANTINO: What I was trying to get 19across to the Board was, if you approve this ASTC, 20they have to have a transfer agreement in place. 21I didn't want the Board to think that they would 22approve this and there would be no transfer 23agreement. That's all I'm trying to point out to 24the Board. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS131 1 That's an IDPH function but I thought the 2Board needed to realize that transfer agreement will 3be required if you approve this project. 4 MR. MORADO: Right. And I just -- to 5piggyback on that, public comments that are made at 6the beginning of the meeting, these folks are not 7under oath. I'm not saying that they're telling -- 8saying deliberate lies, but they're not under oath, 9and they're making allegations against folks who 10have applications up, and you should take that 11information as you will. 12 That said, I don't believe that it's 13necessary to put any kind of condition on the permit 14with regard to a transfer agreement. 15 MEMBER GOYAL: Okay. 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Comments for the Board, 17please. 18 MR. SHEETS: I think we have to be sworn in. 19 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought 20you did that. 21 Thank you. 22 THE COURT REPORTER: Raise your right hands, 23please. 24 (Three witnesses sworn.) DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS132 1 THE COURT REPORTER: Thank you. And please 2print your names. 3 MR. SHEETS: Okay. Good afternoon. 4 Thank you, Mr. Constantino. I finally got 5what you were saying. I appreciate that. 6 I have with me, Madam Chair, members of the 7Board, essentially, the physician who is going to 8run the project if approved, Dr. -- and forgive me, 9Doctor, if I mispronounce your name -- Makhdoom. 10 DR. MAKHDOOM: That's right. 11 MR. SHEETS: And Dr. Makhdoom would like to 12present some testimony with regard to the project. 13And I also have with me Anne Cooper from my office, 14as well. 15 DR. MAKHDOOM: Good afternoon, Madam Chairman 16and members of the Board. My name is Dr. Zahoor 17Makhdoom, and with me are Chuck Sheets and 18Anne Cooper, as mentioned, our CON attorneys. 19 Thank you for the opportunity to appear 20before the Board today regarding our CON 21application. I would also like to thank Mayor 22Mike Hamby of Carbondale who, unfortunately, cannot 23be here but for his strong support of the project 24and Senator David Luechtefeld, Congressman Mike DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS133 1Bost, and candidate for Senate Sheila Simon and 2other political leaders in the area, and my patients 3Joe Ann Troue and Carole Klaine for their support 4for this project. 5 I appreciate you taking time to provide the 6community's point of view on the value of my 7services to the community. 8 The description of the project. As 9Mr. Constantino previously noted in his report, our 10project is a single-specialty endoscopy center to be 11located in Carbondale, Illinois. Importantly, this 12project is limited to endoscopy, which, for a 13gastroenterologist like myself, is a vital tool 14I use to diagnose and treat patients in my practice. 15 Purpose of the project. The purpose of the 16project -- compliance with IDPH requirements. This 17project is before the Board because of Illinois 18Department of Public Health requirements. While 19I currently provide endoscopy services in 20conjunction with the operation of my medical 21practice as permitted by IDPH rules, the ratio of 22surgical to nonsurgical procedures is increasing due 23to my direct-access program, which makes it easier 24for patients in good health to schedule endoscopy DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS134 1procedures. 2 As you are probably aware, other physicians 3have appeared before the Board to convert their 4office-based surgical practices to ambulatory 5surgical centers because IDPH regulations require a 6facility to be licensed as an ambulatory surgical 7center if more than 50 percent of the procedures in 8the facility are surgical procedures. 9 Although we are currently at 45 percent of 10surgical procedures, this percentage is growing, and 11we are requesting Board approval to establish a 12licensed endoscopy center to avoid a potential IDPH 13compliance action in the future. 14 Further, as Mr. Constantino noted in the 15staff report, IDPH does not license physicians' 16offices. The procedures currently performed in my 17medical office are regulated by the Illinois 18Department of Financial and Professional Regulation 19through my medical license. 20 As a family -- as a facility regulated by 21the IDPH, the proposed endoscopy center will be 22required to meet life safety code and quality 23requirements of a licensed ambulatory surgical 24center that will assure services we provide are on DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS135 1par with other endoscopy centers in the state. This 2is a good public health policy. 3 Expanding access to colonoscopy. Expanding 4access to colonoscopy and upper GI endoscopy to 5patients residing in and around Carbondale is an 6integral part of this project. I have been a 7practicing physician in Carbondale for 17 years and 8have always given back to my community. I believe 9I have an ethical obligation to serve patients 10regardless of their situation and insurance status. 11 Colorectal cancer is the third most common 12cancer and the second leading cancer death in both 13genders in the United States. The lifetime risk of 14developing colorectal cancer is nearly 5 percent. 15The American Cancer Society projects that in 2016 16there will be close to 135,000 new cases of 17colorectal cancer and 50,000, unfortunately, 18will die. 19 Consistent with national figures, colorectal 20cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths 21among Illinois adults, with over 2500 deaths 22per year across the state. Early detection and 23treatment of colorectal cancer is essential to 24prevention and cure, and based on this, screening DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS136 1colonoscopy is one of the most important elements of 2the services we offer to our patients. There are 3many initiatives to encourage colorectal cancer 4screening, and better access to endoscopy is an 5important element of this. 6 As your colleague Senator Demuzio knows 7based on her involvement in colon cancer screening 8advocacy, colonoscopy is the gold standard for 9diagnosing and treating colon cancer, and every 10individual aged 50 and older must be screened for 11this potentially deadly disease every 10 years. 12 Current levels of colorectal cancer 13screening in this country lag behind those of other 14effective cancer screening tests. To increase 15access to colorectal cancer screening, it must be 16affordable. According to the latest annual consumer 17survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, 1847 percent of Americans would struggle to pay an 19unexpected $400 medical bill. According to the 2014 20Illinois Hospital Report Card, the median charge for 21a colonoscopy at the Carbondale-area hospitals is 22approximately $6,000. 23 Carbondale is a predominantly rural 24community, and many residents have insurance with DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS137 1high deductible and co-pays. For a patient with a 22500 or 5,000 upfront deductible and 20 percent 3co-pay, the out-of-pocket cost of a colonoscopy 4could be between 1200 and 5,000, which is out of 5reach for many patients. 6 Without a low-cost option, patients are 7faced with the difficult choice of foregoing this 8important screening procedure or traveling 50 miles 9to Cape Girardeau or other areas of Missouri where 10the cost of these procedures is much lower. 11 I firmly believe better outcomes occur with 12education, early detection, and treatment. To 13increase the rates of colorectal cancer screening, 14this must be affordable to all. To that end I've 15agreed to provided free colonoscopies to patients 16referred by Shawnee Health Center, offer colonoscopy 17and upper GI endoscopy assistance programs for 18uninsured and underinsured patients, and provide a 19direct-access program to patients in good health who 20want to save money on avoidable office visits. 21 In April of this year, I entered into an 22arrangement to provide access to free colonoscopies 23to uninsured patients who Shawnee Health Center 24selects to refer to my clinic. Shawnee Health DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS138 1Center strives to improve the health and welfare of 2residents of southern Illinois by serving the needs 3of vulnerable and underserved patients. 4 While the initial agreement provided for 5five free colonoscopies per month, there is a 6significantly increasing need for this service; 7therefore, I've agreed to provide free colonoscopies 8to any patient referred by Shawnee Health Center 9even if the monthly cap is exceeded. I have already 10opened my practice to these patients. 11 Additionally, through a colonoscopy-assist 12program I offer, patients with means to pay but 13with inadequate insurance coverage pay a flat fee of 14$1500, which covers my professional fee, anesthesia 15fee, pathology fee, and facility fee, including 16nursing costs. 17 In contrast, the $6,000 fee noted above only 18includes one of the four elements, the hospital 19facility fee. Patients are separately billed for 20the physician's fee separate, anesthesiology fee 21separate, and pathology fee separate. Those are 22roughly 2,000 to $3,000, and that's added to the 23cost to the patient. 24 Similar to the colonoscopy-assist program, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS139 1under the upper GI-assist program, patients pay a 2flat $900 fee for an upper GI endoscopy or EGD, 3called. The flat fee covers the same scope of 4services. 5 As previously noted, Carbondale is 6predominantly rural and average income is 33,000 on 7the record, with just over 50 percent of the 8population being below the Federal poverty level. 9For those patients who can't afford the flat fee, 10they pay what they can afford and the balance 11generally is written off. We have never hired, in 12our 17 years of practice, any collection agencies. 13 As I first mentioned, I offer a direct- 14access program, but I need to explain what that is. 15The direct-access program is something I do in 16coordination with a patient's primary care 17physician. During general periodic exams a 18primary care physician can help patients in good 19health get an appointment for a screening 20colonoscopy without first having a face-to-face 21consultation for the required history and physical 22with the gastroenterologist who will perform the 23screening exam. 24 As the screening exam is required at 50 and DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS140 1periodically thereafter, we seamlessly coordinate 2these screenings with the patient's primary 3physician, which avoids an extra doctor's 4appointment. Because a nonsurgical visit to my 5office doesn't occur when a patient is a direct- 6access patient, it increases the ratios of surgical 7versus nonsurgical encounters at my office. This 8has required me to delay some of my surgeries at 9certain points in time in order to ensure that in 10any given week I don't do more surgical cases than 11nonsurgical consults. 12 It is important to note both my medical 13practice and the proposed endoscopy center cannot 14qualify for tax exemption as the hospitals do 15because we are a private business. What that means 16is I, unlike the hospitals, do not avoid paying 17taxes under Federal, state, property, and sales tax 18laws nor am I eligible for tax-exempt bond financing 19or to receive charitable contributions from donors. 20 According to a 2011 Health Affairs study, 21the estimated value of Federal, state, and local tax 22exemptions, tax-deductible charitable contributions 23and tax-exempt financing was 24.6 billion in 2011. 24 Based upon Southern Illinois Hospital DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS141 1Services' -- or SIH Services' -- 2014 990 return, 2the system's net income was approximately 357 million. Assuming a corporate tax rate of 435 percent, SIHS' Federal tax liability would have 5been 20 million; however, the collective charity 6expense as reported in the annual hospital 7questionnaire for the three hospitals controlled by 8SIHS was approximately 13 million in 2014 or a 9difference of 7 million between its potential 10Federal income tax liability and amount of 11charitable -- charity care provided. 12 Further, my charitable activities are 13voluntary. I have no charitable obligations like 14the hospitals. While my practice provides 15significant amounts of charity care, we do not track 16it because we are not required to report it, nor 17does it provide us any financial benefits as it does 18the hospitals. 19 Negative findings. I would like to address 20the negative findings to the State Board report. 21 Service demand/treatment room need 22assessment. This project has the same elements out 23of compliance as all the other ambulatory surgical 24center applications have had in the past; namely, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS142 1treatment room need assessment and utilization of 2other providers in the area. This is also another 3situation where the medical practice associated with 4the project is running up against the surgical 5versus nonsurgical encounter threshold. While 6current Board rules provide that these referrals 7cannot be taken into account to determine need for 8the proposed facility, I'm seeking a license for my 9endoscopy services to ensure my medical practice 10complies with IDPH requirements relating to the 11scope of care permitted for a gastroenterology 12medical practice. 13 Further, the provision of endoscopy services 14in an ambulatory surgical center setting is 15consistent with the cost-containment mandate of the 16Board by providing endoscopy services at a lower 17cost to patients and payers compared to the hospital 18setting. 19 Service accessibility/unnecessary 20duplication and maldistribution of services. The 21other two findings concern underutilization of 22existing providers in the area. First, hospital 23outpatient departments are not an appropriate 24setting for endoscopy procedures that can be safely DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS143 1performed in an ambulatory surgical treatment 2center. In fact, payers like UnitedHealthcare, 3seeking to improve cost efficiencies, now require 4prior authorization for upper and lower 5gastrointestinal procedures performed in a hospital 6outpatient setting. No such prior approval is 7required to do the procedure in an ambulatory 8surgical center. 9 Further, hospitals that are more proactive 10in ensuring lower cost access to services in the 11community -- like Advocate, Northwest Community 12Hospital, and Presence -- are investing in 13ambulatory surgical centers to improve access to 14lower-cost services for their communities. 15 As noted above, the median charge for a 16colonoscopy at one of the Carbondale hospitals is 17approximately 6,000 plus 2,000 additional costs on 18part of physician fee, anesthesia fee, pathology 19fee. The maximum charge for a colonoscopy at the 20proposed endoscopy center will only be $1500, 21including all services. 22 Further, the proposed endoscopy center will 23provide assistance programs to uninsured and 24underinsured patients. Importantly, these DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS144 1assistance programs will cover all of the costs of 2the endoscopy procedure while the hospital financial 3assistance programs will only provide the facility 4fee, meaning the patient will still be responsible 5for the physician fee, which is roughly around 550 6or $750; anesthesia fee, roughly around 500 fee; 7pathology fee, roughly around 1200 to 1500 fee. 8 Further, there are no single-specialty 9facilities in the service area that exclusively 10provide endoscopy services with a focus on 11colorectal cancer screening. Two surgical centers 12are multispecialty centers and not only perform 13gastrointestinal procedures. There are other 14surgical procedures going on, too. 15 Physicians Surgical Center, which performs 16gastrointestinal procedures, is operating at the 17State Board standards. Marion Surgical Center and 18Marion Healthcare are nearly 30 minutes away. If 19I had to perform endoscopy procedures at other 20providers in the area, it would be extremely 21disruptive to my practice and the physician extender 22care model we have developed. 23 I need to be at the office location to 24supervise and collaborate with my physician DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS145 1extenders and to most effectively and efficiently 2deliver care to my patients. 3 Gastroenterology is a relatively small 4specialty and only roughly 225 new fellows enter the 5field each year. It is very difficult to recruit a 6new doctor to a nonurban location in Illinois, so my 7physician extenders are key to the delivery of GI 8care in our community. I cannot effectively manage 9my practice if I don't do my work at the same 10location as them. 11 We are here today to require a CON permit so 12we can pursue a license as required by IDPH in order 13to continue this model where I perform my simple 14endoscopy procedures in my office. We are not 15moving cases away from hospitals. They have four of 16their own gastroenterologists. 17 SIHS opposition. With regard to the 18hospitals' opposition, I would like to add some 19context to the comments. I'm the only independent 20gastroenterologist in the Carbondale area and have 21been in practice there for 17 years. I compete 22directly with the primary hospital, which employs 23its own gastroenterologists. Since hospitals are 24permitted by Federal law to require their employed DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS146 1physicians to refer to other hospital-employed 2physicians, I'm in a tenuous position of potentially 3losing my patient base to the hospital-employed 4physicians. In fact, in 2014 I learned hospital- 5employed physicians would be penalized for referring 6patients to me for gastrointestinal services. It is 7important to me to maintain my independence, as I 8can better serve the Carbondale community as an 9independent gastroenterologist. I should not be 10forced to work with the health system that is trying 11to strip me of my patient base due on their size and 12power in the community. 13 SIHS System states there are existing 14facilities in the area that are underutilized. As 15noted previously, hospitals are not appropriate 16settings for endoscopy procedures that can be safely 17and cost effectively performed in an ambulatory 18surgical center. Further, there is no single- 19specialty facility in the service area focused on 20colorectal cancer screening. Finally, traveling 2130 minutes to perform endoscopy procedures at 22underutilized facilities would be detrimental to my 23model of care. 24 SIHS claims the in-office procedures should DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS147 1not be used to justify the need for the project. 2I want to reiterate that I'm seeking a license for 3my endoscopy services to ensure my medical practice 4complies with IDPH requirements. 5 SIHS claims the proposed endoscopy center 6does not have a transfer agreement with a hospital 7in the region. First, this is not -- a licensure 8agreement -- requirement -- and -- not a CON permit 9requirement. This is a licensure requirement and 10not a CON requirement. 11 Secondly, my practice currently has a 12patient transfer agreement with Heartland Regional 13Medical Center, which is 15 minutes away from my 14center, where I'm currently on admin staff. 15 Finally, with regard to the payer mix of the 16proposed endoscopy center, I'm enrolled in Medicaid 17and my current patient base is approximately 185 percent Medicaid; however, it is increasing every 19day. 20 Based on the 2014 annual questionnaire, the 21statewide percentage of total net revenue from 22Medicaid for ambulatory surgical centers was 232.3 percent. The amount of Medicaid services we 24project to provide is over twice the statewide DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS148 1average of surgery centers. 2 Further, as previously discussed, we will 3offer free colorectal cancer screening to patients 4referred by Shawnee Health Center as well as 5financial assistance to uninsured and underinsured 6patients. In short, the proposed endoscopy center 7will be a safety net provider of much needed 8endoscopy services to patients residing in 9Carbondale. 10 Thank you for your time and attention, and 11I would be happy to answer any questions you have. 12 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Questions from Board 13members? 14 Doctor. 15 MEMBER GOYAL: Thank you, Madam Chair, for 16the opportunity to learn more. 17 Thank you, Dr. Makhdoom, for trying to do 18something that is not necessarily common in your 19area. 20 DR. MAKHDOOM: Thank you. 21 MEMBER GOYAL: So I have a series of 22questions and please understand I represent 23Medicaid -- 24 DR. MAKHDOOM: Sure. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS149 1 MEMBER GOYAL: -- on this Board and I don't 2have a vote so -- 3 MR. SHEETS: Doctor, can I interrupt you for 4a minute? 5 MEMBER GOYAL: It's short but go ahead. 6 MR. SHEETS: You said that before, you 7represent Medicaid -- 8 MEMBER GOYAL: I do. 9 MR. SHEETS: -- but -- 10 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: He does. 11 MR. SHEETS: Because I'm just a little -- 12you're Department of Public Health; correct? 13 MEMBER GOYAL: No, I'm not. 14 MR. SHEETS: Oh, you're not? 15 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: That's Bill. 16 MEMBER GOYAL: I look like it but I don't. 17 MR. SHEETS: My apologies. 18 MEMBER GOYAL: No problem. 19 So my first question to you is, in these 20documents that you submitted, you indicate that 21there's is 5 percent Medicaid and there is 2210 percent self-pay, meaning uninsured, and you also 23indicated in your comments that approximately 2450 percent of the population is below poverty. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS150 1 Can you match that with your practice, what 2the demand will be? 3 DR. MAKHDOOM: Yes. The numbers we 4presented are from 2015, and '16 has just almost 5doubled. We haven't assembled the numbers. 6 MEMBER GOYAL: So \"double\" means you have 710 percent Medicaid? 8 DR. MAKHDOOM: 10 percent or even more. We 9are doing, every day, three to four patients of 10public aid on the record in 2016. 11 MEMBER GOYAL: Okay. 12 DR. MAKHDOOM: Now, hospital has 13multispecialty. They have L&D, ob-gyn, surgery, 14geriatrics, young medicine, family medicine, so the 15number of public aid is high. I am one single 16specialty. So only GI services, we have that 17number. 18 MEMBER GOYAL: Yeah, I understand. 19 What is the wait time for somebody to 20schedule a screening colonoscopy in your practice 21today once the request is received? 22 DR. MAKHDOOM: Now, if the request is coming 23from Shawnee Health physician, they all go with the 24family history. If the history is strong, within a DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS151 1week we scope. This is screening. If a patient 2approaches, within a week we scope. That's a 3screening colonoscopy. 4 MEMBER GOYAL: Okay. So the wait time 5normally is -- 6 DR. MAKHDOOM: One week. 7 MEMBER GOYAL: -- a week or less? 8 DR. MAKHDOOM: One week or less. 9 MEMBER GOYAL: Okay. And then my second 10question is, currently -- the way I understand the 11system -- for all of your patients, including 12commercial, Medicaid, or whatever, you're not able 13to charge a facility fee. 14 DR. MAKHDOOM: No. 15 MEMBER GOYAL: Right. With the ASTC 16everybody will pay a facility fee unless it's one of 17your free patients? 18 DR. MAKHDOOM: They do, but that will 19cover -- not uninsured patients. Now, I'm not sure 20how many insurances are going to pay that. 21 (An off-the-record discussion was held.) 22 DR. MAKHDOOM: We have a flat-fee program, 23colonoscopy-assist and EGD-assist programs, so that 24flat fee is $1500, including all services, for DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS152 1colonoscopy and $900 for upper endoscopy, including 2all services. 3 MEMBER GOYAL: Right. So it -- your answer 4to my question is that, by having an ASTC, you think 5you'd be able to serve more uninsured and Medicaid 6patients -- 7 DR. MAKHDOOM: Absolutely. 8 MEMBER GOYAL: -- however, the cost of care 9for everybody else will go up because now their bill 10will be itemized to show a facility fee? Am I 11incorrect in saying that? 12 MR. SHEETS: If the patient were to come to 13his physician office practice, that is correct, 14Doctor. But if the patient were to go somewhere 15else because he's in -- 16 MEMBER GOYAL: I'm not comparing -- 17 MR. SHEETS: -- close to 50 percent, you 18know, then they would have to be referred out, and 19then they would have to pay that fee anyway. 20 But, in theory, you're correct if they came 21to his physician office practice now. 22 MEMBER GOYAL: So if these numbers are 23correct that you supplied -- and you've said that 24the numbers had changed a little bit in the last -- DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS153 1 DR. MAKHDOOM: In '16, 2016. 2 MEMBER GOYAL: Right. So let's say if the 3numbers were what you presented, 85 percent of your 4patients with those previous numbers would pay 5more -- will -- it will become more expensive for 6them as opposed to the 15 percent according to these 7numbers? Am I extrapolating accurately? 8 DR. MAKHDOOM: No. My maximum fee is 1500 9whether from insurance or assist plans or whatever. 10It is not more than 1500. 11 MEMBER GOYAL: For colonoscopy? 12 DR. MAKHDOOM: For colonoscopy. 13 MEMBER GOYAL: So may I ask -- and it will 14help me tremendously to understand your colonoscopy- 15assist program. 16 DR. MAKHDOOM: Yes. 17 MEMBER GOYAL: The charge that you have 18here, $1500 for colonoscopy, 900 for upper 19endoscopy -- I'm curious. What do you charge and 20get paid from commercial and Medicare patients for 21the same procedure? 22 DR. MAKHDOOM: Sure. Commercial pay me $850 23but they pay me -- 24 MEMBER GOYAL: For colonoscopy? DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS154 1 DR. MAKHDOOM: For EDG. 2 MEMBER GOYAL: Okay. 3 DR. MAKHDOOM: But they pay me for pathology 4separate. 5 MEMBER GOYAL: But everybody doesn't need 6the pathology. 7 DR. MAKHDOOM: Mostly do. 8 MEMBER GOYAL: Really? 9 DR. MAKHDOOM: Well, we are looking for 10polyps. At our age you would be surprised. More 11than half have pathology. Pathology is a simple 12procedure to move. We are subject to pathology -- 13 MEMBER GOYAL: Okay. 14 DR. MAKHDOOM: -- so our services include 15pathology. 16 And on colonoscopy commercial pays me -- in 17fact, on multiple tests -- not more than $1200. 18 MEMBER GOYAL: Okay. So why is your 19colonoscopy-assist program cheaper when you're 20charging $1500 for colonoscopy and 900 for upper? 21 DR. MAKHDOOM: We want to serve the 22community. 23 MEMBER GOYAL: No, no. But didn't you just 24say that Medicare pays you -- DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS155 1 DR. MAKHDOOM: No. Medicare pays me 2nothing. Medicare pays me $250 for the scope, and 3they pay separate for pathology if there's 4pathology, as you said. 5 MEMBER GOYAL: Right. But here you're 6getting a bundled -- 7 DR. MAKHDOOM: Bundled. 8 MEMBER GOYAL: -- payment, which is about 9eight times more than Medicare. 10 DR. MAKHDOOM: Now, which are you 11mentioning? We showed everything. 12 MEMBER GOYAL: Let's talk about colonoscopy. 13 DR. MAKHDOOM: Yes. 14 MEMBER GOYAL: Your colonoscopy-assist 15program, you're charging them $1500. 16 DR. MAKHDOOM: 15. Absolutely. 17 MEMBER GOYAL: And you think it's a 18community service and we appreciate that. 19 DR. MAKHDOOM: Yes. 20 MEMBER GOYAL: So when you do a colonoscopy 21on a Medicare patient, did you just say that you're 22being paid $250? 23 DR. MAKHDOOM: No -- if there's nothing. If 24there's -- DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS156 1 MEMBER GOYAL: Right. Right. If there 2is -- 3 DR. MAKHDOOM: Exactly. 4 So maximum per -- Medicare pays for only 5colonoscopies, about 450 or 500, but then they add 6on pathology if you have pathology. 7 MEMBER GOYAL: I understand that but 8that's -- usually pathology's free. 9 DR. MAKHDOOM: But we have in-house 10pathology -- 11 MEMBER GOYAL: Right. 12 DR. MAKHDOOM: -- and that's why I'm able to 13provide a flat feet. 14 MEMBER GOYAL: Yeah. You've bundled them? 15 DR. MAKHDOOM: Yes, for bundled. 16 MEMBER GOYAL: But your bundled price, the 17fee is higher than what Medicare and Medicaid are 18paying you -- 19 MR. SHEETS: I think I know what you're 20asking, Doctor -- 21 MEMBER GOYAL: -- correct? 22 MR. SHEETS: -- and you're a hundred percent 23correct. 24 MEMBER GOYAL: Okay. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS157 1 MR. SHEETS: The only thing I would mention 2is, when you get a facility fee, a physician -- if 3you get a physician fee in a setting that the doctor 4has now, it is a larger physician fee than you would 5get when you have a facility fee that goes along 6with it. 7 So it's not just an add-on. The physician 8fee goes down when there's a facility fee associated 9with it. 10 MEMBER GOYAL: Right. Yes. 11 MR. SHEETS: Just so you know. 12 MEMBER GOYAL: Yeah, I understand that. 13 So I have a need to ask you this one 14question that -- I'm totally unclear. 15 What is your relationship -- why did you 16resign from these other hospitals? 17 DR. MAKHDOOM: Now, I served them 13 years. 18And while I was there, they started recruiting their 19own gastroenterologists, and they told me that they 20have to refer to their own gastroenterologists, so 21they took away two days from me. 22 And they told me to go to St. Joseph's and 23another facility close by. But then Tuesday was the 24only day they could do now for a urologist, so I had DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS158 1to take to my office. That's where the system 2started. When I started practicing in my office -- 3so I would do like a -- 150 in my office, 4 times in 4the hospital. 5 But then sometimes I do one spouse in my 6office and the other spouse in hospital, and then 7the hospital bill would be so high that the spouse 8would come in very angry, \"Why didn't you do this in 9your practice? Because I cannot afford this bill.\" 10 So -- and then they increased their number 11of recruitment -- now they have four. They wanted 12to work the same days, so I had to do something, so 13I started doing them at my office. 14 And you would be surprised to see how they 15were allocated, if they see the hospital bill versus 16their spouse's that would be done in my office. So 17that's why we started doing it. 18 And they mentioned the opposition. I used 19to take Medicare patients with advanced conditions, 20where anesthesia and other care was needed at the 21hospital level. Initially I did have that capacity 22in my office but now I don't. So advanced cases 23I used to take to hospital, patient -- facility. 24 MEMBER GOYAL: Thank you, Doctor. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS159 1 DR. MAKHDOOM: Thank you. 2 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Other questions? 3 MEMBER SEWELL: Yes. 4 I'm looking at the State agency report, and 5it's the treatment room need assessment criteria. 6 And you stated in your testimony that, you 7know, what you're doing is consistent with what 8other applications we've received were with respect 9to this criteria, but the -- according to the State 10agency report, it's suggesting that, based on your 11demand over the last two years, you only justify one 12procedure room but you're proposing two. 13 So can you give me a reason you're proposing 14two other than the fact that all the other people do 15that? 16 DR. MAKHDOOM: No. We initially started in 17one procedure room, but the ADI -- unfortunately, 18sometimes the machine will be down or whatever, then 19my patients will wait. 20 So I created another room, and I have a 21duplicate system in the room. So if this system is 22not working, I can just go to the other room. 23 But now if you look at the two rooms, the 24flow is so quick. Patients are seen quicker, no DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS160 1long wait. And while you finish this, other patient 2is being wheeled into the other room. So it is 3really -- in every facility two rooms are justified 4for better services. But if I had one system only, 5room, and something goes wrong with the machines, 6whatever, then I'm stuck. 7 So I needed another room. I have a 8duplicate system there, too. That helps my 9patients. 10 MEMBER SEWELL: So it's to reduce patient 11wait time? 12 DR. MAKHDOOM: Wait time. 13 MEMBER SEWELL: Is there some standard for 14that? 15 DR. MAKHDOOM: No. The standards are the 16same. We've got two times Joint Commission 17approved, accredited, and two times ASGE or 18endoscopy society accredited for excellent center. 19We hired an architect who is familiar with IDPH 20rules and, according to him, he's satisfied we have 21enough room to put two rooms and equipment in there. 22 MEMBER SEWELL: Well, I'd like to ask 23Mr. Constantino. 24 When you looked at their demand and you DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS161 1determined that one procedure room was needed, was 2there any slack in that at all or -- how did you 3account for that? 4 MR. CONSTANTINO: Well, we can only accept 5those procedures that were performed in a licensed 6ASTC or a hospital -- 7 MEMBER SEWELL: I see. 8 MR. CONSTANTINO: -- and the 462 procedures 9were performed in an ASTC or a hospital, and that 10justifies the one procedure room, not two, as was 11requested. 12 MEMBER SEWELL: Okay. 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: What would you estimate 14the turnover time of those rooms is? As somebody 15who runs clinics, I can't imagine -- you have to 16account for turnover time and, like you said, 17equipment being down -- I can't imagine having one. 18 DR. MAKHDOOM: Upper endoscopy roughly take 19the doctor 5 to 7 minutes, roughly, 10 minutes. And 20then take -- the patient is wheeled out, and then 21I have an area where recovery is close by, and from 22there patient is wheeled in. Colonoscopy takes us 2320 minutes. 24 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: No, I'm asking -- in DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS162 1between patients. What does it take you, like -- 2I think in hospital hours it's like 30 minutes -- 3right? -- to turn -- 20 to 30 minutes to turn that 4room over so it's ready for the next patient -- 5 DR. MAKHDOOM: No, we have -- yeah. We 6have -- in and out takes 1 hour 30 minutes. 7 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Okay. Do you know what 8I'm -- 9 MR. SHEETS: I think I know what you're 10saying. 11 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: You're not answering the 12question. 13 MR. SHEETS: I think what she wants to know 14is, once the patient gets wheeled into the room, 15another patient's wheeled out, how long does it take 16to get that room ready for the next patient? 17 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: I'm trying to say I don't 18know how you could -- from a workflow standpoint it 19would make no sense to have one room because I'm 20guessing it takes you 25 to 30 minutes to roll that 21room over after the first patient's rolled out 22before the second patient can come in. 23 DR. MAKHDOOM: Yeah. 24 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So your workflow -- now, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS163 1what you're going to do is, while they're turning 2over that first room, you're going to take the next 3patient in the second room, and then the first 4room's ready for you again, and then the second 5room's ready for you. 6 DR. MAKHDOOM: Yes. Exactly. Exactly. 7 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Sounds like it's like 20, 825 minutes, I would suspect. 9 MEMBER MC GLASSON: Doctor, you mentioned 10your work with Shawnee Health Service. There are 11some similar organizations in the Carbondale area. 12Are you exclusively offering that service to Shawnee 13or -- 14 DR. MAKHDOOM: We offered a similar service 15to Dixon Health Center, but then they were 16shrinking, so they requested us to liaison with 17Shawnee alone because they are losing the population 18and their number of large services have been 19falling, too. So the offer was available at other 20facilities. 21 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Other questions? 22 (No response.) 23 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Actually -- 24 MR. SHEETS: You know, I hate to even bring DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS164 1this up but I'm going to -- 2 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Uh-huh. 3 MR. SHEETS: -- because I just turned 60 so 4all of this is really strikingly familiar to me. 5 When I was 50 I had my first one, and I went 6to a hospital, the same doctor's practice, DuPage 7Medical Group; a lot of people know them. And when 8it was time to schedule the second, because I turned 960, I went to a surgery center in Lombard. 10 So I think that the biggest thing that I can 11emphasize in the doctor's presentation is that, you 12know, the Blue Cross Blue Shields of the world are 13not approving these procedures in hospitals without 14some preapproval process because they believe the 15charges are higher. 16 So, again, we're looking at a change in how 17these particular procedures are provided, and 18I would just emphasis this is a single-specialty 19surgery center in southern Illinois and the doctor 20just wants to be able to treat his patients and meet 21the IDPH requirements. 22 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So while you're still on 23that -- because I have a question. 24 So to your point there -- and I believe, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS165 1Doctor, what you stated was that there's one other 2ASTC in Carbondale who does colonoscopies in the 3ASTC but they're over capacity at this point. 4 Did I get that correctly? 5 DR. MAKHDOOM: I -- this is a multispecialty 6center, is not single specialty. They do all 7services. 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And they're over -- 9they're over capacity? 10 So if I wanted to -- if I -- because I'm 60, 11too -- 60, also. Make sure we got that on the 12record. 13 If I wanted to have a colonoscopy and lived 14in Carbondale, I don't want to go to a hospital and 15have it, my insurance doesn't want me to go to the 16hospital to have it, where can I go -- right now, 17today -- in Carbondale? 18 DR. MAKHDOOM: My center. 19 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So the multispecialty 20doesn't do it, either? Or they do do it but you 21would be the only single specialty? 22 DR. MAKHDOOM: That's right. 23 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And then -- and so you're 24the only, at this point, independent GI doc in -- DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS166 1 DR. MAKHDOOM: The only independent in 2Carbondale. 3 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Every other GI doc in 4Carbondale -- 5 DR. MAKHDOOM: -- is a hospital employee. 6 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And you did say that 7you're on active staff at Heartland Hospital? 8 DR. MAKHDOOM: Heartland Hospital, yes. 9 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And does that require you 10to take call? 11 DR. MAKHDOOM: Yes. 12 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Okay. So if you were on 13active staff at all these other hospitals, would you 14have to take call at all these hospitals? 15 DR. MAKHDOOM: No. With Heartland, yeah. 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: But you don't -- if 17you're active staff with one hospital, you don't -- 18 DR. MAKHDOOM: One hospital. 19 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And then I want -- Mike, 20this is a question for you. I want some 21clarification on this IDPH issue. 22 So can you explain that to me a little bit 23more? He's really -- if he does any more 24colonoscopies the way he is right now, he's going to DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS167 1be out of IDPH compliance unless he's an ASTC? 2 Is that what I'm understanding from that? 3 MR. CONSTANTINO: That's not my 4interpretation of that, Kath. Okay? I don't view 5that requirement in that fashion. 6 And I've talked to IDPH about this, and 7I hope -- I tried to explain it in this -- 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And I wrote next to your 9explanation \"Huh?\" question mark. 10 MR. CONSTANTINO: They look at everything 11performed at that site, IDPH does -- visits, 12procedures, everything -- to determine the 1350 percent criteria. 14 MR. SHEETS: I think Anne would be better 15suited to answer this because I think she 16understands how IDPH defines \"procedures.\" 17 Is that right, Anne? 18 MS. COOPER: Basically, what we did in order 19to come up with the 45 percent threshold is we 20looked at all the physician encounters, which is 21essentially the surgical procedures that are being 22performed as well as the consult -- the consults. 23Dr. Makhdoom also does other procedures that are 24related to Crohn's disease. And so any kind of DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS168 1procedures that are performed by Dr. Makhdoom or his 2physician extenders, we looked at that in 3determining what the level of surgical versus 4nonsurgical activities were. 5 And so based upon that -- and a lot of this 6is driven by, as Dr. Makhdoom had mentioned, his 7direct-access program whereby patients who are in 8good health can coordinate with their PCP and 9Dr. Makhdoom to actually have a colonoscopy without 10having to come into the office to get a consult. So 11it's actually driving the number of physician 12consults down and then the physician -- and the 13actual procedures up, and that's kind of why we're 14kind of butting up against that 50 percent 15threshold. 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And your concern is that, 17if you exceed that, you're going to be in trouble 18with IDPH, and you don't want to go over that 19threshold? 20 MS. COOPER: Correct. And, basically -- and 21as Dr. Makhdoom has said in his presentation, there 22are some times during a week where he has more 23endoscopies scheduled than consults. And so to stay 24within that 50 percent threshold, he'll push some of DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS169 1his colonoscopies or other endoscopic procedures off 2to another week in order to stay within that 3threshold. 4 So he's very aware of that threshold, and 5he's butting up against it. 6 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Did IDPH weigh in? Or we 7didn't ask them to? 8 MR. CONSTANTINO: I talked to Karen Senger, 9who's in charge of that department, and that's not 10the interpretation she gave me. Okay? I'm telling 11you all -- 12 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So I understand what 13their interpretation is. I don't understand what 14yours is. 15 MR. CONSTANTINO: The activity -- all 16activity at that site needs to be taken into 17consideration when you determine the 50 percent 18threshold. You could dispense an aspirin and that's 19an activity. You could have a patient visit and 20that would be an activity. That's how IDPH has 21interpreted that rule for years. 22 The other alternative -- if you don't 23approve this, the doctor would have to send -- to 24do -- perform some of these procedures at a hospital DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS170 1or another facility if they -- if he feels he's in 2danger of going over the 50 percent. 3 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Which, to your point, 4Chuck, a lot of insurances don't want to do -- 5I know mine won't. I mean, I have to have a heart 6thing or something else going on or I -- they won't 7do it in a hospital. 8 MR. SHEETS: There has to be some 9complication or something. 10 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Right. 11 Other questions? 12 MEMBER MC GLASSON: Yes, Madam Chair, 13although I'm not sure if it's a question or statement. 14 THE COURT REPORTER: Could you use your mic, 15please? 16 MEMBER MC GLASSON: Yes. 17 I'm not sure if it's a question or a 18statement, Doctor. 19 You are going to be such more reasonably 20priced than anybody in your area. If you were to 21become so terribly busy that it strains the 2250 percent, is there a way we can be assured that 23the charity care and the reduced care patients are 24not going to be pushed out of the way? DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS171 1 DR. MAKHDOOM: I can give you assurance. 2I've been doing these services and involved in 3community service for 17 years. Outside a very good 4practice, my purpose is to serve my community and 5I belong there. I can strongly assure you that. 6 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Other questions or 7comments? 8 (No response.) 9 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Seeing none, I'll ask for 10a roll call vote. 11 MR. ROATE: Thank you, Madam Chair. 12 Motion made by Mr. Sewell; seconded by 13Mr. Galassie. 14 Mr. Galassie. 15 MEMBER GALASSIE: I'll be voting no based 16upon staff concerns and financing. 17 MR. ROATE: Thank you. 18 Justice Greiman. 19 MEMBER GREIMAN: I vote aye. 20 MR. ROATE: Thank you. 21 Mr. Johnson. 22 MEMBER JOHNSON: I vote no based on the 23staff report. 24 MR. ROATE: Thank you. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS172 1 Mr. McGlasson. 2 MEMBER MC GLASSON: I will vote yes based on 3the fact that I believe it's a pioneering effort. 4 MR. ROATE: Thank you. 5 Mr. Sewell. 6 MEMBER SEWELL: I'm going to pass. I don't 7completely understand all the issues in this 8program. It sounds like there are some systems 9alternatives to what's being proposed. 10 I'm just not sure so I'm going to pass. 11 MR. ROATE: Thank you, sir. 12 Madam Chair. 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Yes. 14 This is a hard one for me, but I'm 15actually -- I'm actually going to vote yes based 16upon a couple different factors. 17 First of all, as somebody who runs five 18clinics, I can easily, in my head, understand why 19you have to have two rooms instead of one. You 20can't have patients sitting, waiting 25 minutes for 21the staff to clean it before the next procedure, so 22I can explain that. 23 I also -- I don't fully understand the ASTC 24issue, but I understand what he's running up against DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS173 1when I sit and think of trying to schedule 11 docs 2for a day and I have to go, \"Okay. I can only have 3so many appointments that are actual procedures, and 4if I go over 50 percent of what are actual 5procedures, I've got to push those procedures out 6and do more exams or more\" -- I don't know how you 7can run a practice that way. I guess I don't wholly 8understand the rule, but I can't -- I can't wrap my 9head around it. 10 But I think -- I totally understand the 11insurance thing because I've just been through this. 12My insurance will not approve me to have a 13colonoscopy in a hospital. So if I lived in 14Carbondale, I'd drive out of town to have that done. 15It's not a great thing to do anyway, but to have to 16drive out of town to do it -- so I -- for those 17reasons I vote yes. 18 MR. ROATE: Thank you, Madam Chair. 19 That's 3 votes in the affirmative; 2 votes 20in the negative; 1 vote to pass. 21 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Motion fails. 22 MR. SHEETS: Thank you. 23 MR.

CONSTANTINO: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 17 The Applicants are proposing to establish a 18100-bed acute mental illness hospital in Northbrook, 19Illinois. The proposed project cost is 20approximately $31.3 million. The anticipated 21completion date is December 31st, 2017. 22 There was no public hearing; we did not 23receive any opposition letters. We did have 24findings and we had a comment on the State Board DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS176 1staff report that should be in front of you, 16-11. 2You received this by e-mail, also. 3 MR. MORADO: Was that submission timely? 4 MR. CONSTANTINO: Yes. 5 MR. MORADO: Thank you. 6 MR. CONSTANTINO: Thank you, Madam Chair. 7 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you, Mike. 8 Comments for the Board? 9 Do you want to introduce your group there 10first? 11 MR. KNIERY: Absolutely. Thank you, 12Madam Chairman. 13 My name is John Kniery. I'm a certificate 14of need consultant for the project. I am pleased to 15have with me today Mr. Rich -- Dr. Richard Kresch. 16He is the president and CEO of the Applicant 17entities. 18 To my immediate right is Martina Sze, 19executive vice president of US HealthVest. To our 20far right is Mr. Marc Silberman, legal counsel to 21the project; James Cha, the chief financial officer 22for the Applicant; and on my far left is Miro 23Petrovic. He's the architect and he's the vice 24president of physical facilities. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS177 1 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 2 DR. KRESCH: So, first, I would like to 3thank the committee and the staff for taking the 4time to consider our application and to also thank 5those of you who were able to attend the grand 6opening of Chicago Behavioral Hospital and get an 7idea of what we were able to accomplish there. 8 We are a company that has spent the last 930 years developing innovative and patient-centered 10approaches to the care of acute mental illness. 11 MEMBER GREIMAN: Will you talk closer to 12the mic. 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: We can't hear you. 14 DR. KRESCH: Okay. 15 So we have spent the last 30 years devoted 16to developing new and innovative methods of both 17providing care and the delivery of that care to 18patients in need and have focused on reaching out to 19individual groups of patients so that they can 20receive care that's tailored to their needs instead 21of a general standard type of treatment that applies 22to a broad group of patients. 23 An acute mental illness hospital is 24different from a general medical/surgical hospital DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS178 1in that we offer a very limited scope of service and 2our referral patterns are somewhat different. And 3as a result of the nature of our business and 4particularly the focus of US HealthVest and its 5hospitals that we own and operate, we become a very 6community-based organization. 7 We, as a practice in all of our facilities, 8accept every insurance -- Medicaid and Medicare, 9TRICARE, all insurances -- safety net type of 10programs that exist in the communities we serve. We 11do not turn away any patient regardless of ability 12to pay or type of insurance coverage that they have. 13 So our referral base is pretty broad and 14it's very community based, ranging from the police 15to schools, to social service agencies, to 16physicians and other practitioners in the 17communities, and, to a large extent -- and probably 18our biggest single referrer are the emergency 19departments of nearby med/surg hospitals. 20 Everyone who is aware and listens to TV or 21reads the newspapers is very aware of the shortage 22of available inpatient beds for treatment of 23high-acuity, at-risk acute mental illness patients. 24As a result -- and you heard from many of the people DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS179 1who spoke earlier today -- patients are often kept 2in an inhumane fashion for days at a time, sometimes 3chained to a bed in a psych -- in a medical/surgical 4hospital emergency room for lack of better 5alternatives. The need for access is great, and it 6spreads across the entire region. 7 In my own experience -- and it's not really 8a scientific observation but a practical one -- it 9appears that the utilization rates for high-acuity 10mental health services, including inpatient 11psychiatric beds, has been increasing quite 12dramatically over the past decade and will continue 13to do so. 14 The good news is that many people who 15previously could not access care currently can 16because of the Affordable Care Act. And this has 17resulted in a wider acceptance and wider utilization 18of all kinds of mental health services, but our 19focus is on inpatient, and that's what we see. 20 We are an experienced group as far as the 21development and operation of hospitals. Were 22Northbrook to be approved, it would be our 2317th psychiatric hospital. We have shown -- I think 24CBH is an example of our understanding of the DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS180 1community needs, in that we acquired a hospital that 2was in such poor condition in all respects that it 3was about to close. It was literally within days of 4closing, and, within six months, we have been able 5to rehabilitate it to the point where it was 6self-sustaining financially. 7 Within a year, less than a year, we were 8able to renovate the entire half of the building to 9provide high-quality, attractive, efficient patient 10care rooms and to update life safety equipment in 11the remaining part of the hospital. 12 During this time, in spite of the 13construction going on, the hospital was operating in 14full capacity of the available beds. And now that 15we've opened, as of February, the newly renovated 16beds and are able to operate at full capacity, we 17are again finding ourselves almost full. 18 We -- an example, the hospital's licensed 19for 125 beds. We have been consistently running 20over the past few months -- since the new -- since 21the renovated areas have opened -- census in the 22one-teens. So essentially -- the hospital's 23essentially full in just a little over a year's 24operation. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS181 1 In thinking about this project, because of 2this unprecedented -- in our experience -- 3unprecedented demand, we began looking further out 4in the CBH market area and service areas, and we 5realized that there was also a shortage of beds to 6the north of us. 7 And we looked at the two in Lake County and 8northern Cook County, and, unfortunately, the number 9of available beds, according to the bed -- State 10bed-need calculation, was very low in each district 11and, as a result, it would not be feasible to 12establish very small -- we're talking 20-, 30-bed 13facilities. A facility of that size is not viable. 14The only conceivable way those beds could be 15utilized would be as a unit in a med/surg hospital. 16That is also unlikely to occur. 17 And so we had the idea that, well, a way to 18provide these needed beds would be to combine those 19two regions, which are adjacent to each other, 20establish a facility that's at the center and 21intersects the two regions, and we did. We found a 22location that is right on the borderline of the 23two regions, would equally serve them, and if -- 24with putting the available beds and adding a few so DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS182 1that the hospital would be economically secure and 2we could be assured that it would remain open and 3viable for years to come, we came up with the idea 4of combining the two regions, which we understand is 5not consistent with policy, but we think that it's 6consistent with good sense and a commitment to serve 7people in need. 8 We -- an issue came up and I will address 9it. James will talk more about it, but our -- our 10organization has been a successful organization. We 11have specialized, as I mentioned, in de novo 12starting of new hospitals. We've done six. And in 13our acquisition, similar to CBH, we're -- the old 14Maryville -- we focused on the acquisition of 15distressed properties, and we have had a hundred 16percent success rate in turning around all of the 17distressed hospitals we have acquired. And as a 18result, we have found it relatively easy to gain 19access to investment capital. 20 When the financial statement was submitted 21with the application in December, it reflected our 22situation at the time. Our strategy for developing 23new facilities to ensure that they are developed 24with only quality in mind and not to worry about DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS183 1financial aspects of the development is to make sure 2that we have sufficient funds to complete the 3project before we start it. So, as a result, we 4have been successful since the end of last year and 5have raised an additional $59 million in equity 6investment from our investor group and have at this 7point significantly more capital than it would 8require to build and develop Northbrook. 9 So with that, I'd like to turn it over to 10James, who can provide a little more detail. 11 MR. CHA: So, first of all, certainly there 12was a concern raised in the staff report regarding 13the availability of funds, and, you know, certainly 14we apologize for any confusion therein. 15 There -- as Dr. Kresch mentioned, the 16audited financial results that we had at the time 17did, indeed, accurately reflect the resources we had 18available. Over the course of this year, however, 19we have been successful in raising additional equity 20capital. As Dr. Kresch mentioned, we raised 2159 million, of which 9 million has currently been 22drawn and put into the bank, and that is reflected 23in the -- what we submitted for your consideration, 24the letter from our bank, from City Bank -- \"City\" DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS184 1with a y -- dated May 16th showing that we have over 227 million in cash. 3 And, again, we certainly appreciate that -- 4you know, we had previously provided certain 5unaudited numbers that could not have that sort of 6third-party validation, so we certainly appreciated 7that concern and have now provided this bank letter. 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Mike, if I'm correct -- 9I'm sorry. I don't want to interrupt you. 10 But that means that Criterion 1120.120 has 11been met? 12 MR. CONSTANTINO: Well, my concern with the 13letter, Kath, it says over a number of accounts, 14\"aggregate deposit balance of these accounts.\" 15 They have other facilities out there that 16they're operating -- you know, I -- I had asked for 17financial ratio information. I didn't think they 18met the waiver. That's why I asked for it on two 19different occasions, and they never provided it, and 20then they provided this letter dated May 16th, 2016. 21 I don't know where the 59 million is coming 22from. I never -- I haven't seen anything on that. 23 MR. SILBERMAN: If I may approach that. 24 This is being entirely cash-financed through DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS185 1funds that the company has. Where is the disconnect 2I believe -- and Mike will correct me if I'm wrong. 3In the audited financials it shows -- I think it was 4somewhere between 11- and $14 million of cash on 5hand, and there was some question with regards to a 6debt that is no longer on the books, and that did 7affect the cash utilization. 8 What we have supplemented in the letter in 9May that showed the $23 million in cash -- or excuse 10me, the 27 million in cash -- is money that has been 11identified for funding of this project, that the 12cash on hand is viable to finance this project in 13its entirety. 14 Now, what Dr. Kresch has addressed -- and he 15will point out -- is -- and this, I think, goes to 16Mike's concern if there's other projects, other -- 17 DR. KRESCH: So in reference to the 18statement by the banker that it's in a number of 19accounts, we keep, at any given time, a lot of money 20in the bank. The funds that are currently -- 21there's roughly 27-, $30 million in the bank. 22 In order to -- the arrangement we had with 23the bank -- in order to make sure that all of that 24money is insured under FDIC insurance rules, the DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS186 1banks have a system of dispersing and dividing up 2the accounts and having multiple accounts, all of 3which fall beneath the ceiling for coverage under 4FDIC, so that by having the deposit in a number of 5accounts divided up rather than a single account, we 6have the protection of that money being insured by 7FDIC should there be a problem. 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Seems like a good problem 9to have. 10 MEMBER SEWELL: Is there any problem with 11giving the staff the financial ratios they request? 12 MR. SILBERMAN: I -- 13 MEMBER SEWELL: Because that would confine 14it to this project. 15 MR. SILBERMAN: And I believe the answer is 16we did, and that was in the supplemental material to 17the staff report. 18 MR. CONSTANTINO: No. No. I need the 19parent's financial ratio information. They're the 20one funding this project, and that's what 21I requested twice. 22 And we have a disagreement on whether they 23met the waiver or not, and I didn't think they did 24because I couldn't determine if they had sufficient DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS187 1cash. And then I asked for the waiver -- or for the 2financial ratios. That's required. And I haven't 3received them. 4 MR. SILBERMAN: And I guess the response 5would be that the Board's position has always been, 6if a project is being financed entirely through 7internal resources, that that qualifies for the 8waiver of the financial viability ratios. And 9I would hope that the Board would consider that, as 10we have our CEO and our CFO here under oath -- that 11they're both here and available to represent that 12the cash available, internal funds, is on hand to 13finance this project in its entirety. So -- 14 MR. CONSTANTINO: When -- just a comment on 15that. 16 When somebody tells us that they're going to 17fund the project internally, we ask for the audited 18financial statements. We look at cash and we look 19at the funds restricted for construction. We do 20that -- these are not-for-profits. For most 21hospitals in the state they're not-for-profits. 22That's what we look at. It's not just the cash 23line. 24 Second, for-profit entities in the state -- DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS188 1which are essentially just two, Community Health 2Service and UHS -- they are publicly traded 3companies, and they send us their 10-Ks. I know 4they have sufficient cash to fund the projects they 5want to do in this state. 6 I don't know that from the information I've 7looked at here, and that's why I didn't believe they 8qualified for the waiver, and that's why I -- that's 9why I requested the financial ratios. 10 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Go ahead. 11 MEMBER SEWELL: Not to change the subject 12but -- turning to the unnecessary duplication of 13services, do -- I guess I'd ask Mr. Constantino 14this: Do we have a two-planning-area-versus-one- 15planning-area situation here? 16 Is that where the problem is? 17 MR. CONSTANTINO: Yeah. We -- 18 MEMBER SEWELL: They're basing their need 19determination on combining two contiguous planning 20areas? 21 MR. CONSTANTINO: That is correct. There is 22a need in two contiguous areas, 29 beds where this 23facility's going to be located and adjacent to 24it is a 24-bed need for a total of a -- what is DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS189 1that? -- 53. 2 And they're requesting a hundred. 3 MR. SILBERMAN: And -- 4 MEMBER SEWELL: So a hundred would be okay 5if we were allowed to do it based on two planning 6areas? 7 MR. CONSTANTINO: That's correct. We have 8to -- 9 MEMBER SEWELL: But we're not? 10 MR. CONSTANTINO: No. That's correct. 11 MR. SILBERMAN: And the only thing is -- to 12address that point -- because this was something we 13understood in the design. 14 And if you note the geographic location, 15this facility is proposed to be on Lake Cook Road. 16Literally, the facility is on the edge of one 17planning area and, if you walk across the street, 18you're meeting a need. And to the concern that 19Dr. Kresch raised in his opening comments, the 2020-some bed needs isn't enough for a viable 21facility. 22 And so, therefore, the question that we were 23faced with and what this project is designed to do 24is, instead of leaving two planning areas where DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS190 1there's one unmet need, to propose one facility -- 2that we fully understand, by the Board's rules, 3that, indeed, will be looked at by the one planning 4area unless we could have found a way to build it 5across Lake Cook Road, which wasn't going to be 6realistic. 7 But what we hope is, in the discretion of 8the Board, when you look at the overall need of the 9area, when you look at the 45-minute drive time -- 10because that assessment does cross over the planning 11areas -- and when you look at the overall need for 12behavioral health services, that that will be 13factored into the Board's decision. 14 MEMBER SEWELL: And we -- have we looked at 15the occupancy issues in both planning areas? 16 I mean, it doesn't meet the criteria for the 17one with respect to where all of the existing AMI 18beds are and what their occupancy is, but what about 19the other -- 20 MR. CONSTANTINO: Yeah. We have a chart -- 21 MEMBER SEWELL: -- what it says? 22 MR. CONSTANTINO: Go to page 21. There's 23all acute mental health facilities within 2445 minutes, and we have not identified an AMI DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS191 1planning area. There's only one AMI planning area 2or facility in A-08, which is where the 29 beds are 3needed. That's Evanston Hospital and they're over 4the threshold right now. 5 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So when you look at 6Table 14, the first one on there, Chicago Behavioral 7Hospital, and it's at 12.9 percent -- that's much 8higher than that right now; right? 9 MR. SILBERMAN: Those are the most recent 10available data that's reported. 11 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Right. 12 MR. SILBERMAN: But as we've reported -- 13Chicago Behavioral Health is the closest facility, 14and it's currently turning patients away, that there 15are times where they're at capacity. And Martina -- 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: You said 125 beds and 17you're at a hundred-teens on a regular basis. 18 MS. SZE: The chart on Table 14 reflects 192014 data. We acquired that hospital in November, 20so we are now at 125 beds and operating at 2185 percent capacity. 22 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: That's what I thought. 23 MR. KNIERY: Mr. Sewell, if I could address 24your issues. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS192 1 As you know, there are several indicators of 2need. The staff has absolutely identified the 3utilization rates of area facilities, and we 4acknowledge that many of them are not at the State's 5optimal capacity. 6 I would like to note -- point out, also, not 7only does that 45-minute travel time show the two 8planning areas but many more, many additional. But 9there are many indicators of need, utilization rate 10being one, the fact that -- you know, with all these 11underutilized hospitals -- that, you know, we have 12no opposition on the project from them. I think 13it's significant. 14 That was -- you know, that's one of the -- 15the second indicator of need is a calculated bed 16need. We have identified two areas that there is a 17possible need for the service. 18 The third indicator is sufficient population 19to support your project. In the two planning -- 20combined planning areas, A-08 and A-09, there's 211.2 million people. Within the 45-minute travel 22contour, there's 5.9 million people, which kind of 23brings us to the final indicator, is typically the 24ratio of beds to population, and I would love to DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS193 1have Martina just briefly address that for you. 2 MS. SZE: So when we look at markets, we 3assess bed need by using a beds-per-100,000 ratio. 4The national benchmark is 30 beds per 100,000 people. 5the Illinois State average is 31 beds per 6100,000 people. 7 At CBH, as we've noted, we've had to turn 8away a lot of patients due to lack of bed 9availability. So based on this experience, we 10started planning for a new psychiatric hospital. We 11looked at a number of areas, and the Northbrook 12area, the planning area, stood out as having a 13disproportionately low number of beds per 14100,000 people. Right now there are only seven beds 15per 100,000 people in the A-08 and A-09 areas. If 16you approve our project, there will be still only 1715 beds per 100,000 people, which is less than the 18State average. 19 MEMBER GREIMAN: Chairman. 20 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Yes. 21 MEMBER GREIMAN: Yeah. I wanted to ask 22Mike, what will make you comfortable to give you 23what you need to work -- what will satisfy you? 24 MR. CONSTANTINO: I just want what we DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS194 1requested. 2 MEMBER GALASSIE: Yeah. I'm in a position 3where I -- if I may -- 4 MEMBER GREIMAN: Yeah. 5 MEMBER GALASSIE: I'm very supportive of 6this concept. Very much. And I know Lake County's 7issues and needs. But I'm uncomfortable giving you 8a yes vote without that financial information. 9 MR. SILBERMAN: If I could offer one thing 10as an alternative consideration -- 11 MEMBER GALASSIE: That's one vote. 12 MEMBER GREIMAN: That's right. 13 MR. SILBERMAN: -- which is, when we look at 14other projects that are being looked at with regard 15to debt financing, one of the things this Board has 16raised is that people will come in with a commitment 17of someone who is willing to consider the financing, 18and this Board will approve these projects with the 19understanding that \"We're going to find someone who 20will give us the money and we have confidence based 21on our experience.\" 22 What we actually have in front of you is an 23Applicant who's not asking you to have confidence 24that they will find the money. They're standing DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS195 1here before you under oath telling you that \"We have 2the cash to acquire the facility and to build it 3out.\" 4 MEMBER GALASSIE: I'm going to apologize 5because I'm interrupting you -- 6 MR. SILBERMAN: Please. 7 MEMBER GALASSIE: -- but I have to tell you 8I want to hear that from him, not from you, with all 9due respect. 10 That's my level of confidence -- 11 MR. SILBERMAN: That's my -- but if I -- 12 MEMBER GALASSIE: -- speaking as a single 13member. 14 MR. SILBERMAN: But if I understand 15correctly -- and -- is -- what Mike is working from 16is originally the audited financials, which are from 172015 and do give an accurate snapshot in time. But 18the Applicant has then updated the information, but 19it hasn't risen to the level of an additional round 20of audited financials, and so -- you know, and -- if 21you want to -- 22 MR. KNIERY: I'd like to add, also, if 23I may, Member Galassie, we did provide the entity's 24ratios. And I'd love to even explore some of them, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS196 1if you wouldn't mind, if that would help you. 2 MEMBER GALASSIE: Sure. 3 MR. CONSTANTINO: Before John does that, 4those are new entities -- okay? -- that -- and 5they're not financing this project. 6 US HealthVest is financing the project, and 7I don't think they meet the waiver requirements, and 8all I'm asking for is the financial ratios for the 9most -- we asked for three years. That's '13, '14, 10and '15. That's what we asked for. I didn't think 11they met -- I didn't think they met the waiver 12requirements. 13 And now -- you know, they come in here now 14and say they've got $59 million. Well, I don't know 15that. I haven't see any documentation of that. 16 And the comment about the letters we 17received from people wanting to finance these 18projects through a bank letter -- I don't accept 19that. I never have. We've been negative on that 20constantly before the Board. We will not accept a 21letter of commitment made -- I just don't -- we 22don't -- the staff -- the reports do not accept 23that. 24 MR. SILBERMAN: And staff has been DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS197 1consistent. I don't want to -- and, by the way, 2this gives me one opportunity to clarify one 3specific point, if I may. 4 There were some people who testified in the 5public hearing that they had support that was not 6accepted. What this actually was -- and I just want 7to clarify this because I -- this is another example 8where staff is absolutely right. 9 People had submitted referral letters where 10they hadn't met all of the correct criteria, where 11the letter was signed by the operations manager 12instead of the physician, and so staff properly 13rejected those referral letters. The testimony you 14were hearing was from people who still cared enough 15to come here and have their voice heard and show 16their commitment. 17 So staff is absolutely right in its 18rejection of those letters, and Michael is 19consistent in his evaluation of the finances. What 20we're trying to do is to point out that this Board 21does have a degree of discretion in evaluating -- 22the real big-picture question is, \"What is the 23likelihood of this project to be successful 24financially and operationally?\" And -- DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS198 1 (An off-the-record discussion was held.) 2 MR. KNIERY: In discussing with our client, 3I believe our client would be able to offer -- 4within, you know, a week's time -- documentation 5from the investor group specifically to the extent 6the funds are available for this project. You know, 7we could do that as a condition to the permit, 8however you foresee. 9 MR. MORADO: Are you referring to the 10$59 million number or -- 11 MR. KNIERY: No. I'm talking specifically 12about this project that -- you know, the money that 13we are talking about that we do have. We can 14provide you a specific signed affidavit, you know, 15any -- what would fit? 16 MR. MORADO: So more than the letter you've 17already given us to -- 18 MR. SILBERMAN: So to have it certified so 19that it's sworn to. 20 The idea being is this: We want the Board 21and the staff to have the comfort that they want, 22but our issue is that, at the end of the day, 23there's a need for this care. The comments were 24overwhelming. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS199 1 I think to a point that John made is -- when 2is the last time a project for a new hospital came 3forward with zero opposition? And the reason is 4because this is designed not only to meet an 5existing need but to complement existing services. 6There were no competitors who opposed, and many came 7forward to support. 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Mr. Silber- -- Sewell. 9Mr. Sewell. 10 MEMBER SEWELL: can't you just give Mike 11what he asked for? 12 MR. SILBERMAN: The answer is, at this 13point, because it would delay the consideration. 14 And if the answer was to provide the 15guaranty in the process -- but the reasoning for why 16it hadn't been provided previously was, very simply, 17we had documented the cash available to finance the 18project, which historically has been sufficient to 19not require the financial. 20 And if I'm correct, what has been provided 21is the ratios for the consolidated entities, but 22what Mike is asking for is the ratios for the parent 23company alone. 24 MR. CONSTANTINO: Yeah. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS200 1 MEMBER SEWELL: Because that's the source of 2the money. 3 MR. CONSTANTINO: Yeah. 4 MEMBER SEWELL: That's where the money's 5coming from. 6 Okay. For me, as a member, I would want to 7see the staff get exactly what they're requesting, 8number one. 9 And, number two, I'd like to see what we've 10been talking about today so that it -- regardless of 11the fact that we technically cannot consider two 12planning areas -- I don't really care about that 13technicality -- but I'd like to see what it looks 14like if you were dealing with two planning areas 15with respect to these criteria that you did meet. 16The bed need and the occupancy -- occupancy is sort 17of there with this Table 14, but I'd like to see 18that. 19 And then this Board would have to decide 20whether they were going to, you know, consider that 21instead of just the one planning area. I mean, do 22we have any precedent for looking at more than one 23planning area? 24 MR. CONSTANTINO: Not that I can recall, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS201 1Mr. Sewell, but we can do it if you want us to. 2 MEMBER SEWELL: But this Board has the 3discretion to -- 4 MR. CONSTANTINO: Oh, definitely, yeah. 5 MEMBER SEWELL: Yeah. I think, for 6something like this category of beds and the way 7that they are thinking more broadly about responding 8to the need, I -- I personally would make an 9exception to this one planning area. I don't know 10how the other -- 11 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: I agree. 12 MEMBER SEWELL: -- members feel. 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: I'm totally fine. 14 MEMBER SEWELL: But I want to see that. 15I want to see what that looks like in relation to 16bed need, in relation to occupancy, and then I want 17to see the ratios that you're asking for. 18 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So let me ask -- let me 19throw this out there just for -- if we amend the 20motion to put a condition on it that -- within, you 21said, seven days -- Mike can get the information 22that he needs to be able to give us -- and I'm 23actually kind of sorry I brought it up. 24 I thought -- the only reason I brought it up DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS202 1was I thought it was met. I thought -- when we had 2our conversation last week, I thought it was met. 3But, to me, 27 million in the bank is good enough 4but that's my opinion. 5 But I'm with you. I hate to see -- I mean, 6this project is meeting a huge need. There is 7absolutely no opposition. In fact, their 8competitors were here supporting the project. So 9I don't know -- I don't want to hold them up -- can 10we put a condition on it -- help me out here, Juan. 11 MR. MORADO: Yes, we could place a condition 12allowing the Applicant to provide us with the 13requested information specifically with regard to 14the financial ratios within -- I think you said 15seven days. We might want to make it -- I don't 16know -- 14. 17 MR. SILBERMAN: Whatever time frame we will 18make happen. 19 MR. MORADO: So if that -- and -- like -- 20the condition would be that he would provide that 21information that -- I mean, I guess what we have to 22discuss -- is the condition going to be that they 23just provide the information and, because we know 24they have 27 million, we feel comfortable moving DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS203 1forward or -- 2 MR. SILBERMAN: We'd be prepared to offer up 3both the ratios and the verification of the money so 4that -- 5 MR. MORADO: I think we have the 6verification of the money with the letter. 7 MR. SILBERMAN: But I -- 8 MR. MORADO: It's from their bank and they 9said that here under oath. 10 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: It's from their bank. 11I don't know what -- 12 (An off-the-record discussion was held.) 13 MEMBER GALASSIE: But in addition to 14submitting it, Mike has to agree with it. 15 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Mike doesn't have to 16agree with -- I mean, the Board has -- and I -- with 17all due respect to Mike -- I know he goes by the 18book. But the Board has certainly agreed to grant a 19CON where Mike didn't think that every single one of 20these conditions was met. 21 I -- I don't know. 22 MR. MORADO: In terms of the condition, they 23would just -- we would need to have a defined 24time line and a defined action. If the defined DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS204 1action is to provide the information within 14 days, 2then that meets the requirements of the condition. 3 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Are people comfortable 4with that or no? 5 MEMBER SEWELL: Sure. I am. 6 MR. SILBERMAN: And we would accept that 7condition. 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Other questions? 9 MEMBER GALASSIE: I just -- I'm sorry. 10I know it's late in the day. But I still think we 11want Mike to review it and accept it as opposed to 12their just submitting it. What if it isn't what it 13should be? 14 MEMBER SEWELL: That's right. 15 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Well, then maybe they 16have to come back at the next meeting. 17 MEMBER GREIMAN: Well, then they won't 18have it. 19 MEMBER GALASSIE: Right. Then they won't 20have it. I'm assuming they will. 21 MS. MITCHELL: It depends on the condition 22that's placed on it. 23 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: What would be the effect 24to the project of waiting until our next meeting? DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS205 1 DR. KRESCH: The challenge for us from a 2practical level is holding onto the real estate. 3Landlords are not willing to keep buildings off the 4market indefinitely. 5 And we've been able to hang on by giving 6them a -- the landlord -- a proposed date for the 7hearing. If it were postponed, I don't know that 8they would be willing to -- if we'd lose our site, 9it would be very difficult. 10 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So I guess we roll the 11dice and take a vote. I don't know. 12 MEMBER GREIMAN: I think what I'd like to 13know is specifically what Mike would be satisfied 14with. 15 Can you tell us that? Then we can make that 16decision. 17 MR. CONSTANTINO: Judge, I think we need 18the financial ratios for the historic years for 19US HealthVest. 20 And then Mr. Sewell had asked us to look at 21it for two planning areas, AMI planning areas. 22This -- and provide that to the Board. We can do 23that. 24 MEMBER GREIMAN: That's different DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS206 1conditions. 2 MR. SILBERMAN: And anyone in the room can 3disagree with me, but I think -- Member Sewell, with 4regards to the idea of looking at both planning 5areas, I think that the one negative regarding need, 6regarding the utilization of other area facilities 7will hold true because it won't change that there 8are other facilities. But the other components of 9need regarding population per hundred thousand we've 10already testified to and I think are already 11factored in. 12 MEMBER SEWELL: I don't know if that 13population -- that beds per hundred thousand 14population is our standard. 15 MS. SZE: It is. It is. 16 MEMBER SEWELL: Is that our standard? 17 MR. CONSTANTINO: It -- 18 MEMBER SEWELL: I mean, it is a standard 19but -- 20 MS. SZE: The calculation was based on the 21State standard. 22 MEMBER SEWELL: On what our standard is? 23 MS. SZE: Yes. Correct. 24 MR. SILBERMAN: It's a different assessment DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS207 1of need. 2 MEMBER SEWELL: Okay. Different way of 3saying it. 4 MS. MITCHELL: If I may -- sorry to add to 5this, but I just wanted -- so we're asking for the 6historical ratios; right? 7 MR. CONSTANTINO: We asked for three years' 8historic and then the projected years. 9 MS. MITCHELL: Okay. So if I'm 10understanding this correctly, they just acquired 11this new money. So are they -- so even if they 12provide ratios to us, historical ratios to us, will 13they be able to meet this? 14 It's -- am I -- 15 MR. CONSTANTINO: They're not -- from my 16review of what they've sent us, they're not going to 17meet the margin percentage, right. I can tell you 18that right now. 19 MS. MITCHELL: Based on historical 20information; right? 21 MR. CONSTANTINO: Based on the information 22they provided to me right now. 23 MS. MITCHELL: Right. 24 MR. CONSTANTINO: But that's not the DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS208 1criteria. The criteria is the financial ratios for 2the three historic years plus the projected years. 3 My feeling was they had not adequately 4addressed that waiver, and we needed the financial 5ratios. 6 MR. SILBERMAN: And the one irony in all of 7this -- and I'll refer to our CFO. 8 But the one irony of all of this is, once 9we've provided the financial ratios -- and we're 10happy to if that's what the Board needs but -- we're 11still financing this entirely by cash so -- but I'm 12going to ask James, who knows this stuff better. 13 MR. CHA: Yeah. Just to clarify -- perhaps 14this is already clear. But, you know, the 1527 million that we show in the bank letter, that was 16cash that we actually had in the bank as of May 16th, 17you know. Based on our unaudited statements as of 18May 31st, we have 28 million in cash, plus we still 19have the 50 million that we have yet to draw because 20that -- we just closed that financing last Friday. 21We'll be putting out a press release probably 22sometime this week, and we'll also be required to 23file with the SEC a Form D, which will also be going 24out within the next couple of weeks. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS209 1 So we are a privately held company -- you 2know, certainly I do appreciate Mike's concerns 3regarding, you know, a certain lack of visibility 4since we're not Universal, we're not Community. You 5know, our financials are more closely held. You 6know, we've -- we don't have, necessarily, the -- 7it's not normal practice to do sort of quarterly 8audits or things of that nature. 9 So the audit that we have available, you 10know, again, happens to be as of our fiscal 11year-end, which is December 31. Subsequent to that 12we did raise the 59 million, and certainly we have 13documentation executed -- fully excluded 14documentation regarding this $50 million financing 15that we just closed. 16 You know, I have it in my computer right 17now, and certainly if -- insofar as that was useful 18information or documentation that we could provide, 19we could certainly do that, as well. 20 MR. MORADO: Is it fair to say that the 21historical data will reflect that you're not going 22to be in conformance with this criteria? 23 And that you are able to, today, show us 24that you have a letter here for the 27 million DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS210 1that's available for this project and that perhaps 2the Board could consider it as a negative on the 3State Board staff report but we have additional 4information which they can take for -- take it for 5what it's worth and vote on it that way? 6 MR. KNIERY: That would be fair. I would 7like to add one point. 8 It's not that we're trying to hide anything. 9We did provide the statements -- all the audited 10statements -- that those ratios then have to be 11calculated from. So you have that -- Mike has -- 12Mr. Constantino has that information. We do have to 13go back and provide the ratios. 14 MR. MORADO: But when we receive it -- the 15finding, it's not going to change. 16 MR. KNIERY: Right. 17 MR. SILBERMAN: The math will be the math. 18 MR. MORADO: The math will be exactly the 19same. 20 MR. KNIERY: That's what I was saying. 21 MR. MORADO: You will be coming in before 22us, and you'll say, \"I know it says negative just 23like it said last time, but here we have an 24affidavit now versus a letter that says we have DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS211 1$27 million\" -- 2 MR. KNIERY: 3 MR. MORADO: -- \"that's in there to date.\" 4 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Are you ready to vote? 5 MR. SILBERMAN: Is there a condition being 6added to -- attached to the -- 7 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: No. 8 MEMBER GALASSIE: Yeah, I believe there is. 9 I could vote aye with the condition that 10they have to submit this information, financial 11information, to Mike within two weeks. 12 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Okay. So did you -- but 13what they just said is they can submit the financial 14ratios but it's still going to be a negative 15finding. It's not going to change. 16 What they're using for the financing is the 1727 million and the 59 million that they've raised 18since they -- the historical -- the historical 19financial ratios are not going to change the 20findings, is what they're saying. 21 So I don't know -- 22 MR. MORADO: But I think, because 23Mr. Constantino's asking for it, we should have the 24Applicant provide that information along with -- it DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS212 1seems like an affidavit might be a little stronger 2than a letter. 3 MR. SILBERMAN: That's why -- what I was 4suggesting. We're happy to provide both the 5historical ratios that Mike has asked for as well as 6to update the letter to a certification or 7verification. 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Okay. So what you just 9said will be the condition. 10 MR. SILBERMAN: And, for the record, we'll 11agree to it -- 12 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Yes. 13 MR. SILBERMAN: -- if that's required under 14the rule. 15 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Is that all right? 16 MEMBER GALASSIE: Works for me. 17 MEMBER SEWELL: And we want to see the 18two-planning area scenario. 19 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: I thought we were going 20based on the population ratios on that. We still 21need to see something else? 22 MEMBER SEWELL: Well, but there's two 23things. Isn't that correct? 24 There's the beds and the ratio will take DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS213 1care of that. There's occupancy, too. 2 MR. CONSTANTINO: Yeah. We were just -- we 3had requested the financial ratios, and it appears 4they've come to -- the Board has come to a 5resolution on that. 6 And then you suggest -- you had requested 7that we look at the two planning areas, AMI planning 8areas up there, and look at the beds. And we were 9going to do that and provide that information to 10you. 11 MEMBER SEWELL: Yeah. But you -- 12 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: But that's different than 13on Table 14. 14 MR. SILBERMAN: No. That's, I believe, the 15same. 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Is that what's on 17Table 14? 18 MR. CONSTANTINO: Table 14 will show the 19occupancy, but I believe -- and I -- maybe I'm wrong 20on this. 21 But if you look on page -- we had put 22together how we projected the beds for the one 23planning area on page 6 of the report, A-08 AMI 24planning area. And we were going to provide that DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS214 1information to Mr. Sewell, how that is calculated. 2 MR. SILBERMAN: But I guess that -- we 3aren't challenging that. If I'm correct, you also 4provided that information to calculate the need 5for -- that's how the need for A-9 was also 6calculated. And if I'm correct -- 7 MR. CONSTANTINO: Well, that's not presented 8here, maybe. That's what I thought Mr. Sewell was 9wanting us to do. 10 MR. SILBERMAN: But on page 21 it does have 11the utilization of the two AMI services available in 12A-9, A-09, the Highland Park Hospital and Vista 13Medical Center. 14 MEMBER SEWELL: Okay. 15 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So the condition is that 16they will supply -- we will get the financial ratios 17for the three years and some documentation for -- 18 MR. MORADO: And an affidavit attesting to 19the fact that there is, in fact, $27,326,184 -- at 20least that much -- in the bank. 21 MR. SILBERMAN: In 14 days? 22 MR. MORADO: Within 14 days of this date, if 23it's approved. 24 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Any other questions? DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS215 1 (No response.) 2 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: I will call for a roll 3call vote. 4 MR.

Next we have 2Project 16-012, Transitional Care of Lake County. 3 May I have a motion to approve 4Project 16-012, Transitional Care of Lake County, to 5establish a 185-bed long-term care facility. 6 MEMBER GALASSIE: So moved. 7 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 8 And a second, please. 9 MEMBER SEWELL: Second. 10 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: The Applicant can come to 11the table and be sworn in. 12 THE COURT REPORTER: Would you raise your 13right hands, please. 14 (Four witnesses sworn.) 15 THE COURT REPORTER: Thank you. Please 16print your names. 17 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Mr. Constantino, your 18report. 19 MR. CONSTANTINO: The Applicants are 20proposing to establish a 185-bed skilled nursing 21facility in Mundelein, Illinois. The cost of the 22project is $29.3 million. The anticipated 23completion date is June 30th, 2019. 24 There was no public hearing and there were DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS218 1no opposition letters received. 65 letters of 2support were in the application for permit. We did 3have findings on this project. 4 Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 5 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 6 Comments for the Board? 7 They're sworn? 8 MR. SHEETS: Good afternoon. 9 Charles Sheets, again, on behalf of the 10Applicants here. 11 I have with me Mr. Bradley Haber and 12Mr. Brian Cloch, who are the managing partners of 13the Applicant, and Anne Cooper from my office. 14 And I'll hand the microphone over to 15Mr. Haber to present. 16 MR. CLOCH: My name is Brian Cloch, and I'm 17one of the principals and cofounders of Innovative 18Health. First, I'd like to thank the staff for 19preparing such a thorough report and the opportunity 20to respond to it. 21 Thank you, also, to the Board. We 22appreciate the time you've -- 23 THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me. Could you 24speak more clearly or more slowly? Either one. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS219 1 MR. CLOCH: Yeah. No problem. 2 Thank you, also, to the Board. We 3appreciate the time it takes for you to prep for 4this meeting and be here today. Thank you also for 5lending your expertise and volunteering your time to 6ensure residents of Lake County have access to 7quality skilled nursing care in a modern, state-of- 8the-art facility. 9 Unlike the projects we presented to this 10Board at the last meeting, the relocation of 11Winchester House is the type of skilled nursing 12facility project the Board typically considers. The 13proposed project will offer custodial long-term 14care, specialized memory care, as well as a 15transitional care section that is -- as we discussed 16at length last meeting. 17 It is also different than most proposals in 18that it is a replacement proposal. We're replacing 19an aging and deteriorating facility that is 20approximately 170 years old that no longer 21efficiently or effectively serves the needs of 22Lake County residents. In the process, we are 23actually removing 39 beds from the Board's inventory 24while improving quality and access in lowering DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS220 1overall health care costs. 2 As a resident of Lake County, I'm personally 3committed to doing what it is -- what's in the best 4interests of my community. Given the opportunity, 5I'm particularly delighted to provide state-of-the- 6art senior housing and skilled nursing care this 7time to my neighbors. 8 Before we go into the details of the 9project, my partner Brad with Innovative Health will 10address some of the financial concerns highlighted 11in the staff report. 12 MR. HABER: Thanks, Brian. 13 As mentioned, my name is Brad Haber, B-r-a-d 14H-a-b-e-r. I'm a principal and cofounder of 15Innovative Health. I'd also like to thank the Board 16and Mr. Constantino for preparing such a thoughtful 17and detailed report regarding Transitional Care of 18Lake County. 19 Realizing the Board has extensive experience 20within health care and financial reporting, I've 21attempted to address all the financial concerns 22raised in the staff report in the most efficient 23manner as possible. 24 With regard to availability of funds, as you DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS221 1may recall, the same team sitting up here today was 2in front of this Board at the May meeting, and we 3had a fruitful conversation regarding commitment 4letters and what can and cannot be obtained at this 5point in the development process. 6 At that time I mentioned that I am the 7former head of credit and underwriting for 8GE Capital's health care finance division, a role 9I held from 2002 through 2013, and I can attest that 10at this stage of the development process a true 11no-outs commitment from any financial institution 12does not exist in the market today. 13 The last time we were in front of the Board, 14the issue of a firm commitment was of obvious 15concern from several Board members, and it was 16suggested that a bank should provide a commitment 17subject to just the CON approval. The truth is, for 18a bank to provide that type of letter, we would be 19required to provide the financial institution 20everything that would be required to make the 21project construction ready. 22 The major items on this list include but are 23not limited to a recorded zoning ordinance 24evidencing compliance for the to-be-built project, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS222 1which would be no less than about six months to 2complete and in excess of a hundred thousand 3dollars; completed architectural and engineering 4permit-ready construction documents, which would 5take about six months and cost in excess of 6$700,000. 7 The developer would need to buy the land 8outright versus an option because it will be highly 9unlikely a land seller would provide for an option 10to acquire the land for the extended period of time 11required to get the previously mentioned steps 12completed prior to applying for the CON. The land 13alone for this project is $2 1/2 million. 14 Finally, assuming all the above was 15completed and approved, any financial institution 16will require the commitment fee to be paid at the 17time the commitment letter is issued. Average 18commitment fees for a project of this nature are 191 percent of the loan amount. That would equate to 20approximately $250,000 for this project. 21 Having said so, the answer to the question 22of \"Why can't a financial institution provide a 23commitment letter subject to CON approval?\" is it 24would cost the Applicant upwards of nine months of DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS223 1additional time and $4 million of additional costs 2before we could even come to the Board to be heard 3and find out whether or not we'll be awarded a 4certificate of need. 5 Clearly, that is not a prudent approach, and 6because of this inherent constraint and with the 7Board's concerns and requirements in mind, we have 8been diligent in making sure we have pursued and 9will procure the most cost-effective financing 10available in today's market. 11 Moving on from that particular point, we are 12also confident in the financial viability of the 13project. The State Board has a set of financial 14availability ratios that are extremely relevant 15within the overall health care sector but are not 16specific to subsets of the industry, including 17skilled nursing. Financial ratios that are most 18relevant to the nursing sector are percentage of 19debt to total capitalization and debt service 20coverage, with debt service coverage being most 21critical as it demonstrates an organization's 22operating efficiency and ability to meet current 23debt obligations. 24 The Board has set one and a half times debt DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS224 1service coverage as the standard, and, from my 2experience, that's spot-on accurate, and our project 3overwhelmingly exceeds that metric at close to 4four times. 5 In terms of total capitalization, the Board 6has set a less-than-50 percent standard, which is 7applicable to the health care field as a whole. 8When you separate out skilled nursing, the standard 9within the industry is a target of less than 1080 percent from a conventional financing source and 1190 percent for HUD. 12 The staff report notes that we are well 13below that level in our first stabilized year, which 14is well within market standard guidelines and also 15meets the most stringent of underwriting criteria. 16I would also like to note that the Board staff 17report indicates the proposed project is in 18conformance with the criterion reasonableness of 19financing arrangements, terms of debt financing, and 20the reasonableness of project costs. 21 Days of cash is a ratio that is not analyzed 22within the skilled nursing but, rather, a ratio that 23is critical when discussing hospital operations. 24From the perspective of a hospital, something in the DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS225 1neighborhood of 180 days' cash on hand is an ideal 2target. The Board's standard for days' cash on hand 3is set at greater than 40 days, and our project is 4essentially at that target level with 32 days in 5Year 1. 6 Of all the viability ratios, cushion ratio 7is not particularly relevant to skilled nursing, and 8I can say that, in my experience as a lender for the 9better part of my career, my lending colleagues and 10I have never placed any value on cushion ratio as a 11meaningful criteria as it relates to health care 12financing. It is also important to note we are not 13aware of any financial lending platform in today's 14market that utilizes cushion ratio as part of their 15underwriting and approval standards. 16 As Mr. Constantino notes in the report, a 17cushion ratio is an indication that an entity has 18sufficient cash to pay principal and interest 19related to the loan. For a project such as this, 20that particular trigger is debt service coverage, 21and, as previously mentioned, we have four times 22debt service coverage in Year 3, which would be 23considered an A rating in terms of credit. 24 With that being said, from a financial DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS226 1viability and statistical review, our project meets 2all the criteria that active lenders and equity 3investors would look for when evaluating potential 4opportunities. 5 I'll now turn this over -- back over to 6Brian. 7 MR. CLOCH: Thanks, Brad. 8 First of all, I want to thank you in advance 9for giving this project due consideration. As 10stated previously, today's project is unique because 11it is a replacement facility where we're actually 12reducing the existing bed inventory by 39 beds taken 13out of circulation. 14 Plus it is unique because it not only 15provided -- it not only will provide traditional 16skilled nursing care, focused on the existing 17current custodial and memory care clientele, but we 18will also offer our signature transitional care for 19short-term, acute rehab guests. 20 As you heard from Chairman Lawlor, the 21current Winchester House enjoys a rich history of 22providing care to the residents of Lake County for 23well over a century. Through an extensive RFP 24process and board review, the Lake County Board DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS227 1chose the team in front of you today to help them 2transition out of the business of health care while, 3at the same time, providing ongoing, uninterrupted 4care for current Winchester House residents and 5increased access and quality in the future to Lake 6County through privatization and innovation. 7 Clearly, operating according to today's 8standards in a 60-year-old 200,000-square-foot 9building, which is more than two times the proposed 10Transitional Care of Lake County's size with less 11amenities, to say the least, is not optimal. As 12such, Brad and I could not be more thrilled about 13bringing this improvement to Lake County and this 14proposed project to fruition. 15 The ability to innovate and create a new, 16state-of-the-art facility that will provide a new 17home for the current residents of Winchester House 18is very exciting not only for us but for all the 19current Winchester House residents and their 20families. Plus the new Winchester House will 21address the future needs of Lake County residents, 22as well, and be part of the transformational change 23to the health care delivery system that is badly 24needed. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS228 1 The proposed Transitional Care of 2Lake County will be built on the current Winchester 3House's time-tested, firm foundation of a century of 4caring; strong skilled nursing program; high-quality 5rehab department; growing, care 6program; robust life-enrichment offerings; and an 7extensive community involvement. 8 With the needs of the current Winchester 9House residents at the forefront, this replacement 10project will offer three distinct clinical focuses. 11Each of these areas will operate separately from the 12others. Only backroom functions, as the kitchen and 13crew member employee lounge, will be shared. 14 The first focal area is the custodial care 15neighborhood for residents who are no longer able to 16live on their own and require long-term care. 17 The second is a memory care community that 18is designed specifically to meet the special needs 19of people who suffer from dementia related to 20Alzheimer's disease or other neurological illnesses. 21 And the third is the transitional care for 22people who require specialized short-term care. 23Similar to our other projects you have previously 24approved, transitional care is a successful model DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS229 1that is growing across the country. It addresses 2the long-standing, untapped need to reform 3short-term rehabilitative care. 4 This project has received no opposition and 5overwhelming support, as evidenced by the fact that 6over 65 letters were sent in favor for this project 7from Lake County residents. We have also presented 8letters of support from Congressman Robert Dold, 9State Senator Carol Sente, State Representative 10Ed Sullivan, and Mundelein Mayor Steve Lentz. 11 Comments along the way have included \"It can 12be very stressful having a loved one in a skilled 13nursing or short-term rehab facility, but having one 14of this caliber will definitely make my family 15members feel more secure and improve the spirits of 16the patients. 17 \"As a Lake County taxpayer and someone who 18worked with the Lake County system for over 1930 years, this is good for Lake County. It's good 20for the residents that are currently in that 21facility, and it's good for people in the future 22that will be taking advantage of these services. So 23it's a win-win, in my opinion, that's been long 24overdue.\" DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS230 1 In addition, the project concept is 2supported by the Lake County Board throughout the 3RFP process. As you probably recall, we were in 4front of this -- we were in front of you this past 5November where we were approved for the first phase 6of the project, our change of ownership to operate 7the current existing County facility. 8 We were extremely proud of the innovation we 9have been able to bring to the Chicago area 10heretofore, and we are now excited about bringing 11that level of passion, innovation, and expertise to 12Lake County to meet our current Winchester House 13residents' needs and the future needs of the growing 14and aging Lake County population. 15 With your support, we look forward to 16continuing the Winchester House tradition with -- of 17providing compassionate, quality health care while 18bringing new innovation in resident-centered senior 19care to Lake County with the replacement of this 20important community asset. 21 Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to 22innovate and help with the transformational change 23in the health care delivery system in Illinois. 24 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you.

Thank you. 17 Mr. Johnson. 18 MEMBER JOHNSON: I'm going to vote no based 19on the State report. I still don't -- even based on 20the testimony, I didn't really hear verification 21based on the unnecessary duplication of services, so 22I'm going to vote no. 23 MR.

ROATE: Thank you. 3 Mr. Sewell. 4 MEMBER SEWELL: I'm voting yes because it 5looks like they had more beds and they're replacing 6them with less beds in an area that does have excess 7capacity. 8 So I'm okay with that. 9 MR.

Please 14print your names. 15 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Mr. Constantino, your 16report. 17 MR. CONSTANTINO: The Applicants are 18proposing to establish a 106-bed skilled nursing 19facility in Lincoln, Illinois. The cost of the 20project is approximately $20.6 million. The 21anticipated completion date is January 31st, 2018. 22 There was no public hearing, no opposition 23letters received. We did have findings. And if you 24would turn to page 3 under \"Availability of Funds,\" DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS234 1where it says \"Hickory Point Trust,\" that 2should read \"State Bank of Lincoln.\" The bank was 3changed after I had written this report, and 4I forgot to change the bank in the report. 5 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Constantino. 6 MR. CONSTANTINO: It still wasn't a firm 7commitment, though. The finding remains unchanged. 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Comments for the Board? 9 MR. HART: Good afternoon, Madam Chair and 10Board members. 11 My name is Ben Hart. I'm president and CFO 12of Heritage Enterprises. We're the management 13company for the Applicant, and I'd just like to 14introduce the people here at the table with me 15today. 16 On my right, of course, is our CON 17consultant, Mr. Kniery. On the far left is Mike 18Blake, who is our senior vice president of 19facilities. Next to him is David Underwood, our 20chief financial officer. And finally is Mr. Clyde 21Reynolds, who is president of the board of 22St. Clara's Manor, Inc., as well as St. Clara's 23Senior Services. 24 I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Reynolds. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS235 1 MR. REYNOLDS: Good afternoon. This is my 2first time here. 3 I did want to make a clarification. We are 4a 140-bed facility now. We're actually wanting to 5downsize to 106 beds. So whoever made the motion, 6maybe they want to amend that. 7 But I wanted to say it's a pleasure to be 8here. I want to thank you all for your efforts and 9time on our behalf. 10 So the project we're proposing is similar to 11a lot of the things of what Lake County said. We 12are -- started life, actually, 130 years ago as a 13hospital in the Logan County area. We performed a 14function there, critical needs and capacity there 15until the '60s. 16 In 1954 the community built a new hospital, 17and ultimately that led to the -- they didn't need 18two hospitals, and the old St. Clara's facility was 19losing its accreditation because of its age and 20stature. And so in 1962 the St. Clara's Hospital 21ceased to exist, and the St. Clara's organization 22went into hiatus. 23 The following year the St. Clara's Auxiliary 24came out and formed St. Clara's Manor, Inc. It's a DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS236 1not-for-profit, nondenominational organization with 2the sole mission of providing facilities for the 3aged, long-care facilities for the aged. In 1973 4St. Clara's Manor arose out of the ashes of what had 5been St. Clara's Hospital. It had provided a 6service to area residents then, and just six years 7ago, in 2010, we purchased 20 acres of land out on 8the west end of town and we built a 52-unit 9supported-living facility. 10 Just sort of a side note, we built that 11facility next to a 50-acre tract where Abraham 12Lincoln Memorial Hospital just built their new 13facility, so our SLF is located right next to the 14new hospital. 15 But St. Clara's Manor itself now faces a 16crossroads. We're once again in an aged facility. 17We're landlocked. We're downtown. We're a 18two-story building. It's built in the institutional 19style of the '60s and '70s that you would never do 20today, and it's not as good a facility as other 21facilities that are being built today. 22 So we could certainly invest in this 23building and try and restore it and bring it up to 24better standards, but we'll still be landlocked; DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 DEPOS237 1we'll still be an institutional-style building; 2we'll still be downtown. And the alternative is to 3go out and build a new facility on the edge of town, 4on the same campus where Castle Manor is located. 5 Now, the Review Board evaluated our 6application as if we were establishing a new 7facility because the rules and regs won't let them 8consider us as a relocation, but that's a real 9critical distinction. We're not bringing any new 10beds to Logan County. We're actually retiring 1134 beds. The new community will be smaller than the 12existing. 13 Moreover, the new community is going to 14be -- instead of having the institutional feel of 15the current St. Clara's, it's going to have five 16home-style subdivisions within the single one-story 17building; it's going to have -- 87 percent of our 18beds are going to be private beds as opposed to 19semiprivate. We're going to have two specialized 20rooms for geriatric care. We're going to have 21short-term -- specialized levels of care for 22short-term care and rehab care. And we're going to 23have indoor therapy, outdoor therapy, court -- we 24have all these services we just can't do where we DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS238 1are now. So, you know, the last thing will sort of 2allow us to coordinate the services between Castle 3Manor and St. Clara's Manor out on the same campus. 4 That's a lot of change. There are some 5things that aren't going to change. In the end of 62015, over 64 percent of St. Clara's residents were 7receiving Medicaid payments and just 42 percent of 8Castle Manor's were residents of Medicaid. We plan 9to continue that service. 10 We will also have the same staff that the 11residents have known and worked with and have a 12comfort level with, and so that sense of homeliness 13or at least community will continue. 14 I have tried to be brief here, but I don't 15mean to gloss over anything. If people have 16questions, I will be happy to try and answer them. 17 MEMBER SEWELL: Madam Chairman. 18 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Mr. Sewell. 19 MEMBER SEWELL: Yeah. 20 Mr. Constantino, I wanted to -- what more do 21you need on this availability-of-funds issue. 22 It looks like they have these tax-exempt 23bonds in two categories for a little less than the 24total cost of the project. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS239 1 MR. CONSTANTINO: Yeah. The letter -- it's 2not a firm commitment that they are going to get the 3financing. The letter stated it wasn't a firm 4commitment. That's what I'm looking for. 5 MEMBER SEWELL: Can they get any more than 6this at that stage? 7 MR. CONSTANTINO: You'll have to ask them. 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Can we go back to the 9comments that were just made? 10 MR. KNIERY: Yeah. I'd like to first 11address it in terms of -- we are looking for -- it's 12not traditional financing, conventional financing. 13It is bond financing with a traditional construction 14loan. 15 Mr. Underwood, if you'd like to take it and 16address it a little bit further. 17 MR. UNDERWOOD: Thank you, John. 18 In reality, the gentleman that was here 19prior to us that discussed credit limitations really 20kind of spelled it out as well as I possibly could. 21But the signed letter that we did get from the 22financial institution basically uses approval of 23this project as one of their criteria plus a -- they 24also indicated that there's final due diligence, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS240 1which is always the case right before they go ahead 2and actually issue the money. 3 So whether it's conventional financing or 4bond financing or -- the letter from -- the 5commitment letter at this point in time from the 6lender is about as good as we could possibly expect 7to receive at this juncture. 8 But I've spoken with the lender on numerous 9occasions. This current lender also provides 10depository services currently for St. Clara Manor 11and St. Clara Senior Services so -- they're Lincoln 12based. We're very familiar with them and very 13confident that they will follow through on their 14commitment as stated in the letter that was earlier 15distributed to the staff. 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Other questions? 17 (No response.) 18 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: I just want to make sure 19I have my numbers right here. 20 You're closing the current 140-bed facility 21and building a 106-bed facility? 22 MR. KNIERY: Correct. 23 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: So while there's a 2497-bed excess in the planning area, you're decreasing DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS241 1by 36 beds. 2 And then if you could look at Table 1 on 3page 5 in the State Board staff report, it looks 4here like, with the exception of the swing beds at 5Lincoln Hospital, that Christian Nursing Home is the 6only other nursing home in Lincoln. 7 MR. HART: There are actually two other 8facilities in -- 9 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Oh, yeah. I -- well, 10outside -- 11 MR. HART: -- Symphony as well as Christian 12Nursing Home. 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And if you take out the 140 percent utilization in those swing beds, according 15to my math, it comes up to over 70 percent 16utilization in those current spaces combined, so 17you're running out of beds. 18 MR. KNIERY: You're absolutely right. If we 19were to discontinue even the number of beds to 20create a zero net need, there's not enough places in 21Lincoln to take care -- there's not enough beds in 22Lincoln to take care of people. 23 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: That will be displaced by 24those? DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS242 1 MR. KNIERY: That's exactly right. And just 2one additional point I think is very important. 3 Your rules require 30- and 45-minute travel 4time, and I'm not contesting any of that. But what 5is interesting is, looking at their patient origin, 696 percent of all residents in-house come from one 7single zip code, the city of Lincoln. 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Okay. Coming from a 9small community, I understand that. 10 MR. KNIERY: Yeah. 11 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Other questions or 12comments? 13 (No response.) 14 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Seeing none, I'd ask for 15a roll call vote. 16 MR.

And please 23print your names. 24 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: May I have a motion to DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS245 1approve Project 15-044, Transformative a 98-bed long-term care 3facility. 4 MEMBER JOHNSON: So moved. 5 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And a second, please. 6 MEMBER SEWELL: Second. 7 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Mr. Constantino, your 8report. 9 MR. CONSTANTINO: One other thing. We 10didn't pay for this nice handout. 11 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: I'm sure you didn't. 12I know we don't have any money. 13 MEMBER SEWELL: No, Mike, it doesn't look 14like your work. 15 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Ouch. 16 Mr. Constantino, your report. 17 MR. CONSTANTINO: The Applicants are 18proposing to construct and operate a 98-bed 19long-term care facility in McHenry, Illinois. The 20cost of the project is approximately $19.3 million. 21The anticipated completion date is December 31st, 222017. 23 There were findings on this project. This 24project received an intent to deny at the February DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS246 12016 State Board meeting. 2 Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 3 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you, Mike. 4 Comments for the Board? 5 MR. CONSTANTINO: Excuse me a minute. 6 We did -- we do have two comments on the 7State Board staff report. They're in front of you. 8They were received timely. 9 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 10 Comments? 11 MR. JENICH: Yes. Good afternoon, Madam 12Chairwoman and respected members of the Board. 13 My name is Gerry Jenich -- that's G-e-r-r-y 14J-e-n-i-c-h -- and I am the manager for the 15Applicant, TCO JV, LLC, for Project No. 15-044, 16Transformative Health of McHenry. 17 I'm pleased to have with me today 18Mr. Dan Lawler, our CON counsel; Mr. Scott Higgs, a 19certified public accountant and the senior vice 20president of finance for the Main Street Property 21Group and the co-Applicant MS McHenry; Mr. John 22Kniery, our CON consultant. 23 And also available and present to answer any 24additional questions you may have is Mr. Andy Van DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS247 1Zee, representing MS McHenry, LLC, the co-Applicant 2for this project. Not present but in our thoughts 3today is Mr. Charles Foley, our CON consultant. 4 We are here before you today to respectfully 5ask for your approval for the establishment of a 6specialized 98-bed all-private room transitional 7care facility to be named Transformative Health of 8McHenry. 9 The skilled nursing project will provide 10modernized transitional postacute health care 11services in a purposeful, resident-centric facility 12which has been designed to provide a unique and 13significant role in the existing continuum of care. 14 There is an established bed need in McHenry 15County planning service area for 127 additional 16nursing home beds, which supports our request for a 1798-bed skilled nursing facility to fill this need. 18 The Board considered our project at its 19February 16th, 2016, meeting when it issued an 20intent to deny. Since that time we have embraced 21the opportunity to respond to the Board's concerns, 22and we have provided additional documentation that 23we believe thoroughly addresses the Board's 24questions and fulfills any additional information DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS248 1requests by the staff. 2 On behalf of our project team, I would like 3to thank and recognize the staff for their work on 4the State Board staff reports and for their patience 5in participating in multiple technical assistance 6meetings with us throughout this process. They've 7been helpful, polite, timely in their responses, and 8professional in performing their duties. 9 Thank you, all. 10 I'd like to ask Mr. Lawler to first address 11the most recent State Board staff report findings 12and our responses to the Board's two negative 13findings. I will then follow up with an explanation 14as to how this project is uniquely different from 15existing providers and warrants your approval here 16today. 17 Mr. Lawler. 18 MR. LAWLER: Thank you, Gerry. 19 Madam Chair and members of the Board, we're 20before you following an intent to deny, and we were 21hoping for a bit fuller Board attendance today. 22Given that we need 5 of 6 available votes, we 23seriously considered a deferral today but we're 24proceeding today. We had a lot of public comment DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS249 1show up today. We didn't want to send them home and 2bring them back later if they were even available 3later. 4 A deferral is also costly, but the main 5reason we're seeking a vote today is that all of the 6negative votes the last time we were up were based 7on staff's negative findings on two criteria. And 8if you will kindly bear with me today, I will show 9that we meet the letter and intent of those two 10criteria and seek your positive consideration. 11 As it stands, the staff report has 18 of 1220 positives. I've been doing this for 30 years and 13would take a report like that just about any day. 14That's 90 percent positive and would get you an A on 15most tests. I'd like to make the case today that we 16should receive an A plus on this test. 17 The two negatives were on 1125.570, service 18accessibility, and 1125.580, unnecessary 19duplication, so I'll start with 570. 20 Mr. Constantino referred to my written 21comment on the staff report -- that's the Barnes & 22Thornburg letter dated June 13th -- and the service 23accessibility criterion is included as Attachment 1. 24You can see that, under paragraph A, there are five DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS250 1listed factors -- five numbered factors -- and the 2rule requires the Applicant to document at least one 3of the factors in the planning area. 4 On page 13 of the staff report, the staff 5also says that the Applicants must document at least 6one of the factors exists in the planning area, then 7page 16 of the staff report shows that we documented 8at least one of the factors. We documented that 9areas in McHenry County have been designated as 10medically underserved populations, and we documented 11that area facilities have restrictive admission 12policies. 13 At this point you might think we were in 14good shape. The rule requires at least one of five 15factors exists in the planning area, and we 16documented at least one exists in the planning area. 17But I knew from past experience that this doesn't 18always carry the day, so even before the staff 19report was issued, I asked for a technical 20assistance meeting to make the case that \"at least 21one\" means \"at least one\" and does not mean 22something other than \"at least one.\" 23 I had supposed that, as an experienced 24attorney with superior powers of persuasion, I would DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS251 1knock this one out of the park on the first try and 2convince everybody that \"at least one\" means \"at doesn't mean something else, but 4I couldn't do it at the first technical assistance 5meeting or the second. At the third meeting 6I thought I was making headway, but as you can see 7from the staff report, I struck out. I could not 8convince your staff that \"at least one\" means \"at 9least one.\" 10 Page 15 of the staff report shows that the 11staff is requiring documentation of one of the first 12four factors plus the fifth factor. I respectfully 13ask how can that interpretation be derived from the 14rule's language that at least one factor be 15documented. 16 Section 1125.570 is a duly promulgated 17administrative regulation of this Board to which 18certain legal principles apply that Justice Greiman 19will be very familiar with. Administrative 20regulations have the force and effect of law, and 21they are interpreted according to the same rules of 22construction that are applied to statutes. The 23primary rule of statutory construction is to give 24effect to the drafter's intent, and the best DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS252 1indicator of legislative intent and agency intent is 2the plain and ordinary language of a statute or rule 3itself. 4 What could be more plain and ordinary than 5the phrase \"at least one\"? The drafter of that 6phrase, this Board, intended it to mean \"at least 7one of the five factors.\" It did not intend that 8phrase to mean \"one of the first four plus the 9fifth\" because that's not what the plain language of 10the rule says. 11 One more legal principle on agency 12regulations: When an agency has adopted a 13regulation under its statutory authority, the agency 14is bound by that rule as written and may not add 15requirements to the plain language of the rule. 16 The staff here has added requirements that 17are not in the plain language of the rule itself and 18that's not right. Now, I know what the staff's 19concern here is, and it is a very legitimate 20concern. The staff is concerned about 21underutilization in the planning area, and this 22Board is rightly concerned about that, too. 23 The Board has a separate rule, 1125.580, 24specifically addressing underutilization, and there DraftFull Meeting Conducted on 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS253 1is no \"at least one\" language in that rule. 2 In that rule the Board specifically lays out 3what it wants to see from an Applicant when 4there are underutilized facilities in the planning 5area, and there are no exceptions or caveats or 6options in that rule. You meet it or you don't, and 7if you don't, then you should get a negative. I'll 8address that next because we got a negative there 9even though we provided exactly what your rule asked 10for when there is underutilization. 11 We meet the letter and intent of Section 570 12and should have a positive finding there because we 13documented at least one of the five factors on 14service accessibility, and that is all that the rule 15requires by its plain and ordinary language. 16 As the rule is written, underutilization 17should not automatically trigger a negative, but 18that is how the staff is interpreting it. We only 19ask the Board to apply the rule as written, and if 20it's applied as written, we satisfy the rule. 21 Before I leave Section 570, I want to 22address some points that have been raised in 23connection with the factors we documented, and 24that's medically underserved population and DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS254 1restrictive admission policies. 2 Some portions of the staff report might 3leave the impression that medically underserved 4populations are generally small geographic areas 5with relatively few people in them, but that is 6definitely not the case in McHenry County, and the 7staff report does point that out. As the staff 8report notes, over one-third of the geographic area 9of McHenry County has been designated as a medically 10underserved population. That's 200 square miles. 11Also, over 80 percent of the County's population 12reside in that area. That's over 25,000 people. 13 Under your rule, the size of a medically 14underserved population doesn't matter, but even if 15it did, the McHenry County planning area has a very 16large medically underserved population in terms of 17both geographic area and population. 18 Another point that has been raised is the 19contention of our opponents that the proposed 20project itself must be located inside the area 21designated as medically underserved. That is not a 22requirement of the rule. That is something that our 23opponents made up. 24 The rule only requires that the planning DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS255 1area in which the project is located have a 2medically underserved population. The planning area 3here is McHenry County. McHenry County has a large 4medically underserved population, and our project is 5located in McHenry County. That satisfies the 6requirement of the rule as it's written. 7 Another requirement that our opponents made 8up is that the proposed facility must be within 930 minutes of the area designated as medically 10underserved. Note how they contradict themselves 11here. On the one hand they say the rule requires 12that the project must be located inside the 13medically underserved area, then they make up a new 14requirement and say that the rule requires the 15project to be within 30 minutes' travel time of the 16medically underserved area. Again, the rule does 17not require the project to be located within 1830 minutes, but even if it did, the record shows 19that a very large portion of the medically 20underserved population is within 30 minutes of our 21proposed facility. 22 With regard to these requirements that our 23opponents have made up and change at will and that 24are not in the Board's rule, I would again point out DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS256 1the legal requirement that, when an agency has 2adopted a regulation under its statutory authority, 3the agency is bound by it, as written, and may not 4add requirements to the plain language of the 5regulation. The staff can't add requirements. 6Opponents can't add requirements. The rule, once 7promulgated, has to be applied as written. 8 Regarding the second factor under 570, the 9staff report notes that we documented restrictive 10admission policies at two facilities in the planning 11area, one of which does not accept Medicaid 12patients. 13 We had sent the staff the facility's 14Long-Term Care Facility Profile and said it showed a 15facility had zero Medicaid patients in 2014, and 16staff relied on that representation as the basis for 17finding that Medicaid admissions were restricted at 18that facility. Our opponents, who include the 19facility that accepts no Medicaid, filed a response 20to the staff report to dispute the staff's finding. 21They claim that they do not have a restrictive 22admission policy, that they do accept Medicaid 23patients, and that 10 percent of the patients they 24have are Medicaid patients. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS257 1 I freaked out a little when I saw that. I'm 2thinking, \"Did we misrepresent something to 3Mr. Constantino? Did we tell Mike the facility 4profile showed zero Medicaid when it showed 510 percent? Did we not see the 1 in front of 6the 0?\" 7 So I immediately went to the 2014 profile, 8which is on your website, to confirm what it 9actually says and it says 0. There is no 1 in front 10of the 0. It does not say \"10 percent.\" It says 11\"0.\" 12 So now I'm wondering whether 2014 was an 13off year for them. Maybe they had lots of Medicaid 14patients in prior years. So I looked at all the 15profiles I could find on your website, which went 16back to 2011. For each and every year, this 17facility reported its Medicaid patients as zero. 18Not 10 percent, not even 1 percent, but 0, 0, 0, 0 19for four straight years. 20 I knew that your old website had facility 21profiles going back to 1995. I couldn't find them 22on the new one, so I asked Mr. Kniery if he had them 23and he did. In those 20 years, 1995 to 2014, this 24facility's own profiles show that it has not DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS258 1admitted a single Medicaid patient in all 2those years. Now, that is a restrictive admission 3policy. 4 And here's something most peculiar about our 5opponents' response to the staff report: Regarding 6our expectation of having a Medicaid payer mix at 7least as comparable to area hospitals, which is 87.7 percent, our opponents say there is, quote, \"no 9way a facility like ours could reach that level,\" 10and they say it is, quote, \"amazing to suggest that 11we will.\" 12 Now, I can understand how a facility that 13has not admitted a single Medicaid patient in the 14last 20 years would think there is no way to serve 157.7 percent Medicaid and that it would be amazing to 16suggest that anyone can, but these are the same 17folks who are saying that they have 10 percent 18Medicaid even though 20 years of their own facility 19profiles show that they have never admitted even one 20Medicaid patient. Now, that's an amazing thing for 21somebody to suggest. 22 And even if they did admit Medicaid, though 23they've never reported any in 20 years, we still 24documented the factor of medically underserved DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS259 1population, and your rule requires only that at 2least one factor be documented. The staff agrees 3that we documented that factor, and we should 4receive a positive finding under 570. 5 Moving on to 1125.580, unnecessary 6duplication, Section 580 is where the rules 7specifically focus on underutilization and what the 8Applicant can do about it. The criterion is 9included as Attachment 2 to my response to the staff 10report. The rule looks at historical utilization 11and it looks at future utilization. 12 What is very important to note is that the 13rule does not say that, if there is historical 14utilization -- underutilization -- the Applicant is 15out of luck and goes home empty-handed. 16 No. The rule says that, if there is 17historical underutilization, the Applicant must 18document something about future utilization, and the 19rule is very specific about what must be documented. 20There are two things. 21 First, if there are existing facilities that 22are historically at or above target utilization, the 23Applicant must document that the project will not 24lower their utilization below target occupancy DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS260 1within two years after project completion. 2 Second, if there are existing facilities 3that are historically below target utilization, the 4Applicant must document the project will not lower 5to a further extent the utilization of those 6facilities. 7 Note what is being said here. The drafter 8of this rule, the Board, is recognizing that there 9will always be underperformers and there is really 10nothing the Board or the Applicant can do about 11that. As to them, the rule is saying, \"Just don't 12make them any worse than they already are. Don't 13reduce their utilization to a further extent.\" 14That's what the rule says. 15 As for the strong performers who are at or 16above target occupancy, the rule is saying, \"You can 17take them down to target occupancy but no more. 18They are strong now and we want them to remain 19strong in the future.\" That's a good rule. It 20encourages good performance and it does not enable 21underperformance. 22 And please note again the rule recognizes 23that there are and always will be underutilized 24facilities, and that, alone, does not trigger a DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS261 1negative under this rule. The rule does not 2penalize Applicants for underperformance of other 3facilities, but the staff has punished us with a 4negative finding solely because of these 5historically underutilized facilities without regard 6to the future utilization aspect of your rule. 7 The negative finding here enables 8underutilization. It provides a positive incentive 9for facilities to remain underutilized because they 10know their underutilization will result in a 11automatic negative finding from the staff on new 12project applications. But the Board's rule, as 13written, does not promote underutilization in this 14way. 15 If the Applicant can document that its 16proposed project will not reduce strong facilities 17below target utilization and will not reduce the 18underperforming ones lower than they already are, 19then the letter and intent of the rule are satisfied 20and the Applicant should receive a positive finding. 21We have documented above and beyond what the rule 22requires and should have a positive finding on this 23criterion. 24 How does an Applicant document what the DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS262 1utilization of the planning area will be two years 2from project completion? There is only one way to 3do that. You have to make projections. You have to 4take existing historical data, come up with a 5methodology, and then use the historical data and 6methodology to make projections about the future. 7There is no other way to do it, and the rule says 8you have to do it. 9 Some Applicants just make up their own data 10and their own methodology, and this is often looked 11upon with suspicion because it's hardly objective 12and often not reliable. Sometimes the Applicant 13pays a professional consultant to make objections, 14and their objectivity and reliability might also be 15called into question. 16 We haven't relied on either of those 17sources. We are relying on the most objective, most 18reliable, most professional source imaginable. We 19are relying on the State Board's own projections as 20to what planning area utilization will be in the 21future. Your projections are the foundation of the 22CON planning process. Those projections must be 23validated and must be reliable or else we wouldn't 24have a legitimate planning process at all. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS263 1 Now, there may be a tendency to think that, 2if there is a projected bed need in an area with 3underutilized facilities, then something must be 4wrong. And since the historical data can't be 5wrong, it must be the projections, but that's not 6the case at all. 7 Historical underutilization and future bed 8need can, in some circumstances, be entirely 9consistent, and that's the situation here. Your 10projections for McHenry County fully account for the 11current, existing underutilization. 12 Let's look at those projections. They are 13contained in Attachment 4 to my response to the 14staff report, and that page is directly from the 15inventory of health care services for long-term care 16category of service. 17 There are 997 long-term beds, long-term care 18beds in the planning area. Your latest inventory 19shows that, of the nine long-term care facilities in 20McHenry County, eight were underutilized, so that's 21the starting point of your projections. Every 22facility in the county but one is underutilized. 23That's taken into account. 24 Now let's project into the future. The DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS264 1first place to look is projected population growth. 2The total population growth in McHenry County is not 3all that much. As noted in the staff report, it's 4only a little over 1 1/2 percent annually. 5 But the growth rate in the 65-and-over age 6cohorts is very high. As noted in the staff report, 7the five-year growth in the 65-to-74 population is 8over 31 percent and the 75-and-over population is 9over 25 percent. The aging of the population is 10guaranteed. Nothing is going to stop the aging 11process, try as we might. 12 Inevitable aging of the population would 13create a tremendous demand for long-term care beds, 14so much so that, despite the fact that eight of 15nine existing facilities are currently underutilized 16and despite the fact that these facilities currently 17have 254 dead beds which they don't even set up, the 18Board has determined that future demand will be so 19great that, even with 90 percent occupancy of all 20997 beds, there will still be a need for 127 more 21beds, and that means there is a need for our 22proposed 98-bed facility. 23 That's not our projection. That's not a 24paid consultant's projection. That is the DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS265 1projection of this Board and its professional staff 2pursuant to the statutory mandate. The Planning Act 3directs the Board to plan for and promote the 4development of modern health care facilities, 5especially in areas where the planning process has 6identified unmet need. The Board's planning process 7has identified an unmet need in McHenry County, and 8this project will provide modern, comprehensive, 9long-term care services to meet that need. 10 So we have gone above and beyond what your 11rule requires. We have documented that the one 12facility above target utilization will remain at 13target utilization, and we have documented that 14future demand will allow all the underutilized 15facilities to not merely maintain their current 16occupancy levels, which is all the rule requires, 17but, also, reach target occupancy themselves, which 18is far beyond what the rule requires. 19 Our opposition is saying that your 20projections are off and that they will never be at 21target utilization, but who's calling the shots 22here? Is it the Board, who has the statutory 23authority and obligation to make these projections? 24Or is it the self-interested competitors who never DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS266 1want to see a new, modern facility in McHenry 2County? 3 And even if your projections are off some 4and these facilities don't hit the target occupancy, 5your rule does not require that they do. It only 6requires that they maintain their current level of 7utilization, and your projections amply demonstrate 8at least that. 9 So with the most reliable, most objective, 10most professional evidence out there, we have 11documented complete compliance with your criteria, 12and we should have a positive finding here. 13 There is an additional factor under 580 14which strongly supports our project. Under 580 a 15surplus of beds is indicated when the bed-to- 16population ratio in the planning area exceeds 171 1/2 times the State average. 18 The bed-to-population ratio in McHenry 19County is less than half the State average, which is 20much less than 1 1/2 times the State average. The 21bed-to-population ratio is so low in McHenry County 22that, according to the Board's inventory, it has the 23second lowest number of long-term beds per person 24among all 95 statewide planning areas. It's so low DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS267 1that, even with the addition of the 98 beds in this 2project, McHenry County will still have the second 3lowest bed-to-population ratio of all statewide 4planning areas. 5 Page 19 of the staff report concludes that, 6based on these ratios, it does not appear that there 7is a surplus of long-term care beds in McHenry 8County. Our opponents' spin on this finding of the 9staff report is mind-boggling. In their response to 10the report, our opponents cite the staff's finding 11that there is no surplus of beds, then they say, 12quote, \"This translates to there is an excess of 13beds.\" 14 I don't know what translation service our 15opponents are using, but when the staff says there 16is no surplus of beds, that does not mean there is a 17surplus of beds. Maybe that's what it means in 18Bizarro World, but in the real world, when the staff 19says there is no surplus of beds in McHenry County, 20it means there is no surplus of beds in McHenry 21County. 22 One final point before I turn things back to 23Mr. Jenich: You have heard our opponents say that 24we are skimming the Medicare patients from area DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS268 1hospitals. We have examined that claim by asking a 2health care data provider that the Applicants rely 3on in the ordinary course of business to provide the 4data on referrals and admissions from the area 5hospitals. That data they supplied to us shows that 6area facilities admit only one-half -- about 7one-half of the Medicare patients that are referred 8to them. Of over 1600 Medicare patients referred to 9these facilities in 2014, 860 were admitted and 10780 were not. 11 That surprised us so we sought confirmation 12from the hospitals themselves independently. We 13sent the data to Centegra Hospitals and asked if it 14was consistent with their experience, and they told 15us that it was, and that was confirmed by the 16Centegra executive who spoke this morning. 17 Why are so many patients in need of skilled 18nursing services not being admitted to area 19facilities? There are only two likely reasons for 20that. Either the facility doesn't accept the 21patient or the patients and their families don't 22accept the facility. 23 In either case, neither is a good reason for 24denying a new facility in McHenry County, but both DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS269 1are excellent reasons to approve a new facility in 2McHenry County. We are not going to deprive 3existing facilities of their Medicare patients. We 4will be providing a very nice facility for many 5McHenry County Medicare patients who are not being 6admitted into existing area facilities. 7 Madam Chair, in conclusion, because we have 8an A-plus application, I respectfully request this 9honorable Board to approve Project 15-044. 10 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 11 Can I open it for questions? Or did you 12have more comment? 13 MR. JENICH: I do. 14 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Okay. Please go ahead. 15 MR. JENICH: Thank you. 16 And thank you, Dan. 17 Board members, at the February Board meeting 18Chairwoman Olson asked us to share distinguishing 19features of this project. we took that question to 20heart. After the meeting, in the time since, we 21focused on this specific question and produced what 22we believe is a thorough, comprehensive response 23that has been included in our submissions and the 24materials provided to you by staff. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS270 1 For easy reference, I've provided you with 2excerpts from that submission today. And, Mike and 3Courtney, thank you for allowing those to be shared 4with the Board. 5 To begin, please refer to the comparison 6chart on page 3 of the handout as well as pages 4 7through 13. Transformative Health of McHenry will 8provide transitional care services in a caring and 9supportive, homelike environment designed to bridge 10the gap from hospital to home. This unique physical 11plant and its care-delivery model is what 12differentiates this project from all other existing 13service providers in the area. 14 First, as written on pages 7 and 8, our 15facility will have all private rooms. This means 1698 private rooms with 98 private bathrooms and 1798 private sinks, toilets, and shower facilities. 18No other provider in the service area provides all 19private rooms. 20 By comparison and by their own submission, 21our opponents show that they have very few private 22rooms. On May 31st Crystal Pines submitted a letter 23of opposition showing that it only has 7 private 24rooms in its 114-bed facility, and Crossroads, a DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS271 1115-bed facility, reported only 4 private rooms. 2 Altogether, four opposing facilities 3identified by Crystal Pines report 380 total beds, 4but they only offer 35 private rooms. That equates 5to less than 10 percent of their total beds. These 6providers offer very few private rooms and even 7fewer private bathrooms. Most of their private 8rooms are actually conversions from double-occupancy 9rooms where the majority of patients have to share 10bathrooms, sinks, and toilet facilities. Patients 11today strongly desire private rooms, and their 12families strongly desire for their loved ones to be 13in private rooms. Unfortunately, there are few 14available in the service area today. 15 At a 98 count, our single facility will 16offer nearly three times the number of private rooms 17currently available at the four opposing facilities 18combined. All our private rooms will include 19attached private bathrooms fully equipped with 20toilet, sink, and shower, designed to limit the 21spread of infection and provide for a patient's 22privacy, comfort, and, most importantly, their 23safety. 24 Another significant physical plant DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS272 1distinction is found on page 17 of your handout. On 2page 17, here you will see that our total gross 3square feet per bed per the project is one and a 4half times larger than the required State minimum 5and will be two times the size of the average gross 6square feet per bed of existing providers in the 7primary service area or the PSA. 8 Stated another way, our 700 gross-square- 9foot bed facility as compared to the service area 10average of 342 gross square feet per bed provides 11for larger rooms and more common spaces that result 12in added patient comfort and safety. Our single 13private rooms will be larger than the average 14double-occupancy rooms of existing providers. 15 Our facility will be new and modern. Also 16on page 17 you will note that the average age of 17existing facilities in the primary service area is 1836 years old. The majority of the area facilities 19were built in the early 1970s and before, and, for 20the most part, these dated facilities are not being 21modernized. 22 Next, please refer to page 18. On page 18, 23here you will notice that Medicare and Medicaid cost 24report information filed by the facilities DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS273 1themselves. This table shows that, over the last 2five years, the average annual capital expenditure 3of existing facilities was only $130,540 per year 4per facility. Our project alone represents capital 5expenditure over three times greater than what the 6opposing area facilities report to the State Board 7in the past five years combined. 8 Other important and noteworthy project 9distinctions, Chairwoman, include an on-staff 10psychiatrist, seven-day-a-week rehab staffing, 11full-time physician services, realtime laboratory 12and radiology services. 13 As noted in your handout, we have many other 14distinctive features in our project that are 15currently not available in the service area. All 16these features are designed to promote healing, 17improve patient care, improve patient comfort, 18improve patient safety, and improve patient and 19family privacy. 20 Patients will benefit from and thrive on the 21comfort and convenience of this noninstitutional 22alternative residence center, homelike environment. 23As we have previously stated, most of the existing 24area facilities were built in the 1970s or earlier, DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS274 1and the vast majority of beds are in small, 2multioccupancy rooms. 3 We're introducing an alternative way to care 4for these patients because we know people are no 5longer satisfied with this level of care, and this 6may be a significant contributing factor as to why 7PSA utilization levels are reported as being low. 8In fact, McHenry County residents and their families 9are leaving the county to seek care at facilities 10like our proposed project. 11 Anecdotally, we are aware of at least three 12facilities outside of McHenry County that are most 13similar to the proposed project which have admitted 14over 75 residents from McHenry County in just the 15last year. These facilities are 45 minutes to over 16an hour away. They don't show up on any State 17inventory data because patients and families are 18choosing to bypass existing providers because the 19services that they desire do not currently exist in 20the planning area. 21 As vocal as our opponents have been before 22this Board, not one of them requested a public 23hearing on our project, as they were all entitled to 24do. Instead, they chose to come before you and DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS275 1express opposition and ignore your own rules for 2public participation by continually repeating the 3same issue. Perhaps they don't want to publicize a 4brand-new facility with 98 rooms is proposed for 5McHenry or have the public comment on their own 6facilities rather than reporting only nominal 7expenditures for capital improvements over the past 8five years. These area facilities represent the 9type of old-style nursing homes which the public and 10the industry are moving away from. Today, modern 11patients demand modern services. 12 There are public policy makers who also wish 13to see movement for the health care delivery system 14that includes facilities like the one ours is 15purposefully designed for. In the 2008 final report 16to the General Assembly, the Illinois Task Force on 17Health Planning Reform addressed the state of 18long-term care industry in Illinois and encouraged 19this health Review Board to consider the following, 20beginning quote: \"Consider how skilled nursing fits 21into the continuum of care with other care providers 22and to encourage modernization, more private rooms, 23the development of alternative services, and current 24trends such as resident-focused care in the DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS276 1provision of long-term care services,\" end quote. 2 Our resident care focused -- our resident- 3focused care project addresses each one of the task 4force's desired reforms and provides the updated 5level of care addressed in the 2008 final report. 6More importantly, our project is specifically 7designed to provide a continuum of care on the 8campus of an existing acute care provider. This 9project will provide higher staff ratios, 10alternative clinical services, and amenities 11designed to monitor patient changes in medicine, 12promote healing, and manage the residents' total 13well-being and families' peace of mind. 14 In every industry and in life, competition 15is what drives innovation. Healthy competition 16translates into everyone working to be his or her 17best. From a health care system perspective, this 18positively impacts patients in terms of cost, 19quality, and accessibility to the latest treatments 20and care models available. 21 Our project introduces health care 22innovation into the service area, and this results 23in a more affordable, convenient, efficient, and 24accessible health care system, all of which are good DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS277 1for the patients and ultimately benefit the 2community. 3 In their book entitled \"The Innovator's 4Prescription: A Disruptive Solution for Health 5Care,\" Dr. Jason Hwang of the University of 6Michigan, Professor Clayton Christensen of the 7Harvard Business School, and the late Dr. Jerome 8Grossman, Harvard School of Government, state, \"It's 9not that health care is doing a poor job. It's 10improving but it just doesn't change the way we want 11it to.\" 12 For change to happen, what disruptive 13innovation theory tells us is that it's almost 14always a new entrant to the industry that figures 15out another way of doing things. We are the new 16entrant, and we have figured out a better way of 17doing things. We are proposing this project before 18you today to provide the residents of McHenry with 19access to the future of transitional care. If we 20want a more affordable, convenient, and innovative 21health care delivery system, we must create it. 22 If our opponents choose to continue to treat 23their patients in the same manner that they've been 24doing it since the 1970s, in buildings that were DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS278 1built in the 1970s, then, by all means, let them do 2it. We certainly won't stop them, nor should they 3be permitted to stop the development of new, 4innovative, and modern facilities in McHenry County. 5 The data provided to you in your Board 6packets indicates that this project will not hurt 7the existing providers. The data is based on the 8CMS cost reports filed by the opposition themselves, 9and it shows that they are receiving hundreds upon 10hundreds of patient referrals beyond what they've 11actually admitted into their facilities. That's 12right now. Can the State and this Board's 13projections show that the local referrals will 14increase dramatically due to the aging population? 15 As noted on page 7 of the Board -- of the 16staff report, the five-year growth rate for the 1765-plus age cohort in McHenry County is 31 percent 18and the five-year growth rate for the 75-plus age 19group is 25 percent. This is what creates a bed 20need of 127 beds in the planning area, and this is 21what the Board's methodology shows to allow all area 22facilities, including our opponents' and including 23our project, to be at target occupancy by 2018. 24 I developed this project and filed this DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS279 1application because I relied upon and believed in 2your data and your projections which support that 3there was a need for more skilled beds in McHenry 4County. Your projections were a fundamental factor 5in our business planning, and I am personally 6invested in that plan and those projections. A 7substantial portion of my life savings is now 8committed to this project. This is a project in 9which I strongly believe, and this is a project that 10is strongly supported by the Board's own data. 11 In closing and with consideration of the 12information made available to you in our 13application, subsequent submissions, and the 14testimony provided here today, I wish to create -- 15reiterate or repeat the following set of facts. 16 Fact No. 1: There is an established bed 17need for 127 beds in the planning area. 18 Fact No. 2: There is no surplus of beds in 19the planning area as determined by both the staff 20and the bed-to-population ratio. In fact, McHenry 21has the lowest or the second lowest bed-to- 22population ratio among all 95 statewide planning 23areas, and it has less than half the beds per 24individual than the State average. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS280 1 Fact No. 3: As stated, our project 2differentiates itself from a physical plant 3perspective in that all of our beds will be private 4rooms with private bathrooms, and no other facility 5in the planning areas has all private rooms. 6 Fact No. 4: All of our beds will be dual 7certified for Medicare and Medicaid, and our 8financial projections track with what -- the 9information that we see coming out of the hospitals 10and will be a minimum of Medicaid patient volume of 1110 percent. 12 Fact No. 5 -- 13 MEMBER GALASSIE: There's not 75 of these 14facts, are there? 15 MR. JENICH: There are 10. 16 MS. AVERY: 10. 17 MR. JENICH: And I'm almost done. 18 MEMBER GALASSIE: Thank you. 19 MR. JENICH: -- area providers relegated 20over 250 beds and bed status. On page 7 of the 21staff report, it shows that, in 2014, 254 of 997 22beds were set up. That's almost one-quarter of all 23planning area beds, and it is six times the State 24average of dead beds. Again, that's six times the DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS281 1State average for dead beds. 2 Reason No. 6 -- and I'm almost done, sir. 3Thank you for allowing me to continue -- the Board's 4bed-need projections show that the 65-and-older age 5cohort in McHenry County are increasingly so rapidly 6that all area providers will reach target occupancy 7by 2018. 8 No. 7: Even now, CMS cost report data shows 9that area facilities are admitting only about half 10the patients referred to them from area hospitals. 11Many McHenry County patients are leaving the 12planning area seeking alternative skilled nursing 13services elsewhere. 14 No. 8: Local patient referrals are not 15currently being admitted to area facilities, and 16these referrals will dramatically increase as the 17population ages. Existing facilities will not be 18adversely affected by the proposed project. There 19are plenty of documented referrals in the planning 20area to support both the area providers and this 21project. 22 No. 9: The staff found that we met 18 of 2320 criteria, and we have respectfully presented 24extensive and compelling evidence to demonstrate our DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS282 1substantial compliance with all 20 criteria. 2 No. 10: This project will deliver up-to- 3date modern care -- modern nursing services in a 4manner not currently provided in the planning area. 5It meets all the concerns recognized by the Illinois 6Task Force on Health Planning Reform in its final 7report to the General Assembly, which encourages 8this planning Board to consider modernization, more 9private rooms, the development of alternative 10services, and resident-focused care trends like this 11project will provide. This project will most 12assuredly have a positive impact on the residents 13who desire access to alternative, high-quality, 14resident-focused care and services in McHenry 15County. 16 For all of the above reasons, we respectfully 17request the Review Board approve Project No. 15-044, 18Transformative Health of McHenry. This is a good 19project for this community. 20 Thank you. 21 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 22 Questions from Board members? 23 (No response.) 24 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: That was pretty DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS283 1comprehensive. Seeing no questions, I'll ask for a 2roll call vote. 3 MR. ROATE: Motion made by Mr. Johnson; 4seconded by Mr. Sewell. 5 Mr. Galassie. 6 MEMBER GALASSIE: Aye. 7 MR.

If you have 5questions, please address them to Courtney or Juan 6or Jeannie. 7 I would like to have a motion to maintain 8the July 2014 through December 2014 exec session 9minutes confidential and closed. 10 May I have such a motion. 11 MEMBER JOHNSON: So moved. 12 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Can I have a second, please. 13 MEMBER GALASSIE: Second. 14 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: All those in favor say aye. 15 (Ayes heard.) 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Opposed, like sign. 17 (No response.) 18 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Motion passes. 19 No discussion under bed changes, capital 20expenditures. 21 You have a list of meeting -- oh, you 22were -- I'm sorry. 23 You received a report on bed change, capital 24expenditures for 2013 and capital expenditures for DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS286 12014 as well as the meeting dates for 2017. If you 2have any questions, please let Courtney or Juan 3know. 4 We are not firmed up on any of the sites for 52017, probably mostly because we haven't paid 6anybody since 2014, so I think eventually we're 7going to wear out our welcome. I think people will 8be meeting at my house in 2017. 9 MEMBER GALASSIE: We'll second that. 10 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And, Mike, we have 11corrections to one of the profiles? 12 MR. CONSTANTINO: Yes. We just need a voice 13vote on this, Kath. 14 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Okay. Go ahead. 15 MR. CONSTANTINO: Rush -- go ahead. 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Go ahead. 17 MR. CONSTANTINO: Rush University Medical 18Center, Advocate South Suburban, and John Stroger 19are asking the Board's permission to change profile 20information. 21 MS.

Stroger, Jr., Hospital for 2013 and 2014. 12 May I have a motion. 13 Dale -- Dale moved. Do I have a second? 14 MEMBER JOHNSON: Second. 15 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: All those in favor? 16 (Ayes heard.) 17 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Opposed, like sign. 18 (No response.) 19 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Motion passes. 20 MEMBER SEWELL: Let the record show that 21I abstained on that vote because the School of 22Public Health has an active contract with the 23Cook County Health and Facilities System, and I'm a 24principal investor in that. DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS288 1 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Sewell. 2 MEMBER MC GLASSON: Would my abstention be a 3problem? 4 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: It would. 5 MEMBER MC GLASSON: Then I vote aye. 6 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Okay. 7 Is there -- why did you think -- finally, 8Juan, the interagency agreement. 9 MR. MORADO: Yes. I just passed out a copy 10to you and to Mike and George -- and, Melanie, 11I apologize; I don't have your copies yet. 12 But there's only two changes from the IGA 13that was approved last year. One change is that the 14Board will now provide IDPH with a copy of our 15personnel handbook, and the other change is that we 16are going to be asking for the consultation with 17HFSRB-IDPH regarding the number of staff designated 18to us to happen by a certain date. In this case, 19that would be by June 15th of the next fiscal year. 20 So we already have in our IGA that IDPH will 21consult with us regarding who gets assigned to work 22on Board matters. Those meetings, as I understand 23it, have not happened. So it's been in writing but 24it hasn't quite happened yet, so we're hoping to DraftFull Meeting Conducted on June 21, 2016 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COMPLANET DEPOS289 1strengthen that part a little bit more. 2 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And you would like a 3motion to approve? 4 MR. MORADO: Yes. 5 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: May I have a motion to 6approve the HFSRB-IDPH interagency agreement. 7 MEMBER GALASSIE: So moved. 8 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: And a second. 9 MEMBER SEWELL: Second. 10 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Thank you. 11 Any other questions or comments? 12 (No response.) 13 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Seeing none, I would call 14for a voice vote. All those in favor say aye. 15 (Ayes heard.) 16 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Opposed, like sign. 17 (No response.) 18 CHAIRWOMAN OLSON: Motion passes. 19 I would like to just make one very quick 20announcement. 21 I'd like to recognize Barb Haller.
