Mugwort Benefits Many people consider mugwort a common weed. It spreads aggressively and can take over large parts of a garden. Because it's related to ragweed, people who are allergic to ragweed may be allergic to mugwort, as well. So, some people destroy mugwort when it turns up in their garden. But in certain parts of the world, it's purposely grown to make herbal medicine. Purported mugwort benefits menstrual cyclesIncreasing urine output Historic Mugwort Uses Roman soldiers used to put mugwort in their shoes to relieve foot pain from marching. St. John the Baptist was said to wear a girdle of mugwort to relieve stomach pain. Active Components The parts of the mugwort plant that grow above the ground are used to make essential oil. Compounds in the oil\u2014including camphor, pinene, and cineole\u2014are said to have potent antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal effects. A chemical called artemisinin is found in the root, stem, leaves, and blossoms of the mugwort plant. When eaten, artemisinin is said to cause gentle contractions of the uterus, which promote regular periods. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), it's sometimes used to induce labor. Artemisinin is thought to have anti-cancer properties, though this has yet to be proven. Conditions Treated To date, there is little scientific evidence that mugwort can prevent or treat any medical condition. Even so, it is regularly used for: Amenorrhea (irregular or absent periods) Anxiety Chronic fatigue Colic Constipation Depression Eczema Diarrhea Epilepsy Headaches and migraines Insomnia Nausea or vomiting In TCM, mugwort is used in the practice of moxibustion. This involves rolling mugwort into sticks or cones, igniting them, and waving it over the part of the body being treated. This is thought to enhance the effects of acupuncture. A 2012 review suggests moxibustion can reduce the need for cesarean sections by aiding in the delivery of breech babies. Further research is needed. Possible Side Effects Mugwort is considered safe for most people. However, you shouldn't use it if you're pregnant because the uterine contractions it causes can lead to miscarriage. Due to the lack of safety research, you also shouldn't give it to children or use it while breastfeeding.
