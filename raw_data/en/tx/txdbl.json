Terranova, Assistant Execut ive Director Current Board Members Current Board Staff BOARD OPPORTUNITIES Expert Reviewers WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW From the Chair \"Pain Treatment and Opioid Misus e Treatment - Two Sides of the Same Coin\" Louisa Barnhart, MD, MPH Chair of BOLIM In the Board's summer newsletter , Dr. Peter Sacc hetti, M.D. wro te an article regarding the need for a balanced approac h to opioid prescribing (http://www.maine.gov/md/sites/ma ine.gov.md/files/inline-files/2 that sentiment and urge physi cians and physician assistant s who treat chronic pain with opiates to consider tr eating patients suffering from opiate misuse disorder with buprenorphine. While new laws and rules have been enacted to address the issue of overprescribing of opiates, and it seems we are get ting a handle on that, there ar e sequelae of these measures that significantly im pact patients w ho have been on ch ronic opiate medications for many years. On e of these sequelae is the loss o f a clinician willing to provide continuing care with ev en modest amounts of opiates. Fo r example, recently a group of chronic pain clinicians a bruptly closed their practice , leaving numerous patients scrambling for alternative care and treatment. The Board regularly reviews c omplaints against clinicians regar ding prescribing practices. These complaints come from a variety of sources, inc luding patients. The Board's review of these complaints is consistently based on the medical records (including documentation of medi cal decision-making) and the us e (or not) of universal precautions. Clinicians who employ universal precautions and wh ose prescribing practices are supported by the m edical record have nothing to f ear from the Board. Unfortunately, the application o f these precautions by some cli nicians has involved a steep learning curve, and requi res a balance of compassion and verification of appropriate use of prescriptions. W ell-meaning clinicians who p rescribe opiates without this balance risk harming patients. Fortunately, in Maine there ar e groups of clinicians who have e xpertise in this area and are willing to help. If you or a c olleague are considering trea ting patients with opiates or if you are already prescribing opiates and are struggling with the implementation of these universal precautions, contact the Maine Independent Clin ical Information Service (\"MICIS\"), which provides ac ademic detailing and peer-to-peer e ducational outreach designed to improve prescribing practices. To schedule a sessio n, go to: https://micismaine.org/contact/ . Finally, treating pain with opiates and treating opiate misuse with buprenorphine are two sides of the same coin. I urge c linicians who prescribe opiates for pain to become educated about buprenorphine treatm ent for opioid misuse and to provide opioid misuse treatment. Clinicians w ho already prescribe opiates have the mo nitoring mechanisms in place to prescribe buprenorphi ne. In addition, this further edu cation, and subsequent treatment of patients with bupr enorphine will help inform and e nlighten clinicians to the signs of opiate dependence in pati ents they are treating for pa in. Treating opiate dependence is very rewarding and can change - or even save - a patient's life. Give it a try! Governor Mills' Response to the Opioid Crisis By Gordon Smith, Director of Opio id Response, State of Maine I appreciate the opportunity to ke ep physicians informed of the actions the Mills administration is taking to addr ess the opioid/ addiction crisis in our state. You are already familiar with the actions announced in February includi ng the purchase and distribution of naloxone, the re cruitment, training and coordin ation of 250 recovery coaches, the initiation of low -barrier access buprenorphine in all 33 emergency departments in the stat e and the expansion of medication assist ed treatment to all inmates (in prison or jail) wit h a diagnosis of substance use d isorder. Since February, the following additional act ions have been announced or brought forward by the 129th Legislature. 1. Enhance the services at the 7 existing syringe exchange site s and expand to an additional 5 sites. 2. Incentive existing recovery r esidences to become nationally certified and to not discriminate against residents on Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT). 3. Work with Maine St ate Housing Authorit y to renovate or const ruct up to four new recovery residences. 4. Sponsor the second annual Gover nor's Opioid Response Summit scheduled for July 23, 2010 at the Cross In surance Center in Bangor. 5. Initiate two projects (one urban, one rural) providing housi ng and treatment to up to fifty chronically homeless in dividuals with opioid use disor ders. 6. Establish additional recover y centers in Millinocket and Lin coln. 7. Establish a recovery friendly job program in t he state, in c ooperation with the federal and state Department of Labor. 8. Hold 10 to 12 screening of rec overy appropriate movies follo wed by panel discussions and community forums in northern and eastern Maine (in November, 2019) 9. Continue to expand treatment options including review of rei mbursement options and develop strategies to expand the number of prescribers with their x waiver (currently just over 900). 10. Support at least two state chapt ers of Young Persons in Rec overy (YPR). 11. Review the provision of ser vices to mothers with SUD of chi ldbearing age. A robust Substance Exposed Infants (SEI) Working Group continues to meet every month to evaluate present effo rts and explore additional ones. We are presently working on the problem of the variability of the reports being made to Child and Family Services. The federal gov ernment now requires the state to make a distinction between substance af fected infants and substance ex posed infants. Additional projects and strat egies are being worked on. In Sept ember, senior members of our team held a day long retr eat to prioritize future spendi ng and then had the opportunity at the MMA meeting in Bar Harbor to present these r ecommendations to Governor Mills. At the retreat, t he highest priority was determ ined to be Treatment, followed by Recovery Support, Prev ention and Overdose Response. Our Prevention Task Force is c haired by Educational Commissione r Pender Makin and has held three meetings and seve ral subcommittees continue to m eet between meetings of the Task Force. In a ddition to looking at curriculu ms featuring the topic of social emotional learning, our Ta sk Force members are also revi ewing out of school activities. A number of strategi es are being developed to help get at-risk youth outdoors and engaged in positive, healthy activities. I appreciate being aided in this particular work by former first lady Mary H erman who is working for Commis sioner Makin. It is a singular honor and pleasure to deliver the Governor's m essage of hope and recovery across the state. Thank you for all you do as physicia ns to assist those in recovery. I look forward to repor ting to you again in 2020 and reviewing the progress made in the first year of our w ork. If you have a question abou t this work or wonder what you can do to help, don't hes itate to communicate with me at Gordon.Smith@maine.gov or call me on my cell phone at (207) 592-0859. Death with Dignity Law: An Intersection of Law and Ethics On September 19, 2019, \"An Act T o Enact the Mai ne Death with Di gnity Act\" became effective law in the State of Maine. http://www.mainelegislature.org /legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=HP 0948&item=3&snum= 129 The Death with Dignity Act (\"law \") provides qualified patients (as defined in the law) who possess the requisite capacit y to make informed decisions r egarding their care at the end of life. More specifica lly, the law allo ws qualified pa tients to request and obtain prescriptions for medications fr om an allopathic or osteopathic physician licensed to practice medicine in Maine for se lf-administration in order to end their life in a humane and dignified manner. I n addition, the law explicitly prohibits \"a physician or any other person to end a patient's lif e by lethal injection.\" Here are some highl ights of the law: 1. The law includes safeguards for patients, including: o Defining a \"qualified patient\" to be a co mpetent adult (18 year s or older) who is a resident of this State who has been determined by an a ttending physician and consulting physici an to be suffering from a termi nal illness and voluntarily expressed the wis h to end their life in a human e and dignified manner. o Outlining the multi-step process by which a patient may make re quests for medications for self -administration. o Outlining attending physi cian responsibilities. o Specific waiting periods. o Medical record document ation requirements. 2. Physician participation in D eath with Dignity is purely volu ntary, and the decision to participate or not is left to the individual physician's exe rcise of conscience. However, physicians who are unabl e or unwilling to carry out re quests from qualified patients for medication s to end their lives \"shall tr ansfer any relevant medical records for the patient[s ] to a new health care provide r upon request by the patient[s].\" In addition, the law allows health care facili ties and licensed professionals to prohibit its emp loyees and contractors from pa rticipating in any activities authorized by the law while on the premises of the f acilities or while in the course of employment or cont ract with those facilities. 3. The law provides some protec tion for physicians who choose t o participate in Death with Dignity. Specifically , the law states that the \"fact that a health care provider participates in activi ties under this Act may not be t he sole basis for a complaint or report by another health care provider to the appr opriate licensing board...\" However, the law also exp licitly states that it does no t \"lower the applicable standard of c are\" for any services provided pursuant to the law. Thus, physicians who deviate from the pr ocesses established by the la w or who violate a standard of care may face i nvestigation by the Board. The Board recognizes the inters ection between this new law and existing medical ethics, including The Code of Medi cal Ethics of the American Me dical Association. The new law permits but does not requi re participation by physician s and provides protection from discipline solely for prov iding services under the law. Th e Board recognizes that physicians will follow their indi vidual consciences in choosing whether or not to participate in any activities authorized by the law, and that a ny such decision, by itself, cannot and will not form a basis for either investigation or di scipline by the Board. Alzheimer's Disease - Early Detection Is Vital Alzheimer's Disease affects an es timated 5.8 million Americans. Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease is critical to: Initiating benefic ial treatments Allowing patient and family time for futu re planning Establishing medical and persona l care services coordination The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) now recommends that all adults aged 65 and older receive ann ual cognitive health assessments. This is one of six new quality measures for improving health car e for cognitive concerns. (1) The Alzheimer's Association co nvened a group of practicing expe rt clinicians to make consensus recommendations for an effective, practical, and easy process for detecting cognitive impairment in the prim ary care setting. Follow this l ink to learn more about the benefits of early-detection, rec ommended cognitive assessment t ools, who should be evaluated, and more: https://www.alz.org/prof essionals/health-systems- clinicians/cognitive-assessment The Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) jointly issued four criteria and guidelines to diagnose Alzheimer's disease, includ ing recommendations for clinical office settings.

The Boards ar e proposing to amend Chapter 21 in response to concer ns regarding its potential impa ct upon: in-patients, patients in any custodial care facilities (including nursing ho mes, rehabilitation facilities, and assisted living facilities) where the patients do not have possession or control of their medications and where the medications are dispensed or ad ministered by a licensed, certified or registered health care provider, cancer patients, and terminally ill patients receiving hospice care. The proposed amendments to Chapter 21 would: Exempt from the rule the treatmen t of patients who are in-patie nts of any medical facility, or the treatment of pat ients in any custodial care fa cilities (including nursing homes, rehabilitation fac ilities, and assisted living f acilities) where the patients do not have possession or control of their medications and where the medications are dis pensed or administered by a licensed, certif ied or registered health care provider. Exempt cancer patients from the dosage and days' supply prescri bing limits. Exempt from the rule the treatme nt of terminally ill patients r eceiving hospice care.

Chapter 12 - Proposed Rule on O ffice Based Opioid Treatment Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a pr oliferating chronic medical co ndition. Office based opioid treatment (OBOT) is one way clinicians can treat OUD. OB OT integrates the treatment of OUD into the general medical and behavioral care o f the patient by allowing qualif ied clinicians to prescr ibe an opioid agonist su ch as buprenorphine in the primary care setting. Clinicians interested in providing OBOT m ust have completed requisite training and obtained a DATA 2000 waiver. Information regarding the training and waiver can be found at: https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted- treatment/training-materials-re sources/apply-for-practitioner-w aiver . The the Maine B oard of Osteopathi c Licensure, and the Maine Board of Licensure in Medi cine previously proposed a join t OBOT rule for public comment.

HEALTH AND WELLNESS Wellness for Physicians & Physician Assistants By Guy R. Cousins, Director, Med ical Professionals Health Progr am Located in Manchester, Maine, the Medical Professionals Health Program (\"MPHP\") is a program of the Maine Medical Association, which receives financial support from a number of professional lic ensing boards. Overseen by a peer review committee, the MPHP assists healthcare professionals chal lenged with substance use, mental health, and behavioral issues, as well as stress and burnout by providin g confidential and compassionate monitoring, s upport, treatment resources, advocacy, education and outreach. For more information regarding the MPHP visit: https://www.mainemphp.org/ . There is a significant volume of literature about stress and bu rnout in the medi cal field. It routinely identifies the professional and personal demands that drive burnout. Those demands include: Professional Stressors: expectations of unrealistic endurance time pressures excessive work hours threat of malpractice suits difficult patients coping with death, loss, & grief sleep deprivation unsupportive work environments Personal stressors: financial worries limited free time isolation uncertainty a culture of silence a lack of effective stress management skills Wellness is truly the antithes is of burnout. Interestingly enou gh it is foundational in the Hippocratic Oath. The Oath states that: \" I (Physician) will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure. \"(1) Focusing on Wellness is only a paradigm shift when believing th at physicians are already included in the promoti on of health and wellness. Welln ess is an active process of being aware and making choices toward a healthy & happy life . The Substance Abuse and Mental H ealth Services Administration ( SAMHSA) identifies eight dimensions of wellness. (2) They are: 1. Emotional- coping with life and creating satisfying relation ships 2. Environmental -being in stimu lating environments that suppor t well-being. 3. Intellectual - recognizing cr eative abilities/finding ways t o expand knowledge and skills 4. Physical - recognizing the need for physical activity, diet, sleep, & nutrition 5. Occupational - personal sati sfaction and enrichment derived from one's work 6. Financial - satisfaction wit h current and future financial s ituations 7. Spiritual - expanding our sens e of purpose and meaning in li fe 8. Social - developing a sens e of connection, belonging, and a well-developed support system. These dimensions are inter-c onnected and when life challenges u s in any one of these domains, we can easily lose our balance. The habits we develop and use (especially the healthy habits) are critical to how we actively meet these challenges and work toward our overall wellness. It is important to recognize tha t these domains of wellness occ ur both on an individual level and an organizati onal level. Health and medical organizat ions must recognize the importance of these domains and how they can promote a healthie r work environment. This slight shift in promoting wellness to include physicians a nd physician assistants is essential as our workforce cont inues to struggle with stress an d burnout. Focusing on the health and wellne ss of our practitioners togeth er can be a game changer for all.
