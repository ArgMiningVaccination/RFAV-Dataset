To schedule an appointment, please call 623-537-6000. The [Clinics](https://www.mwuclinics.com/arizona) are located at: 59th Ave & Utopia Glendale, AZ 85308 When starting as a student, you must be in compliance by submitting all documentation for immunizations and titers from your immunization Checklist. All immunization documentation is submitted through your student portal. Please make sure and submit the documentation to the appropriate category Immunization Requirements You are responsible for periodically checking your immunization compliance status [HERE](https://online.midwestern.edu/). If you notice information you believe is incorrect, please contact [Kendra Ibrahim](mailto:kibrah@midwestern.edu), MMS, PA-C. If you are required to have titers, you need to either have your hometown doctor order it or come to campus and establish with one of the healthcare providers at the Multispecialty Clinic or get a lab requisition form from Student Services. If you need a booster, you would either have your hometown doctor order it, come to campus and establish with one of the healthcare providers at the Multispecialty Clinic, or go to a local pharmacy (call the Pharmacy ahead of time). All of your uploaded immunization documents will be on your Immunization page as an attachment under the Document Type section. You can open the attachment and print this off for providing documentation to rotation sites and employers. There is no need for you to contact Student Services to get copies of any of your documentation as it will all be available on your immunization page. Health insurance doesn't always cover blood titers so please be aware of this and check before you have them done as they can be costly. Please note that you have 30 days from the start of classes to complete the titers. If you will have the Aetna student insurance the titers are covered. If you have your own insurance we have a discount rate available through a local lab. To take advantage of these, please stop by Student Services, in Barrel II, to obtain a lab requisition form and we will direct you from there. Midwestern University has contracted with Sonora Quest Laboratories in the Phoenix Metropolitan area to facilitate this process and minimize your expenses and also to assure that the correct tests are done. If you wish to take advantage of our discount with Sonora Quest Laboratories, you will need to come to the Office of Student Services to pay for the titers and obtain a requisition form. The university provides a 30 day grace period following the start of classes to allow you to get these titers drawn. The expense of the blood titers will also be included in your financial aid package which you will receive the first week of classes. We recommend that you wait until you have received your financial aid refund before you have your titers drawn. Again, you must come to Student Services first in order to take advantage of the discount. Immunization Checklists | | Medical, Doctor of Physical Therapy, Pharm.
