In accordance with federal regulations, the Sharp Memorial Hospital 201 9 Community Health Needs Assessment (SMH 201 9 CHNA) also includes needs identified for communities served by SMBHWN, as the two hospitals share a license, and report all utilization and financial data as a single entity to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). The SMH 201 9 CHNA summarizes the processes and findings for communities served by both hospital entities. Additionally, per the regulations, SMH will submit an implementation strategy \u2014 a written strategy to address the needs identified through the CHNA \u2014 that will inc lude programs and services provided by both SMH and SMBHWN. The SMH 201 9 CHNA and FY 2020 - FY 2023 Implementation Strategy received approval from the Sharp Memorial Hospital Board of Directors on September 16, 2019. Daniel L.

Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment ii Acknowledgements SMH's 2019 CHNA process included the time, effort, insight and contributions of many members of the San Diego community. The S MH 2019 CHNA is built off of the Hos pital Association of San Diego & Imperial Counties 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment (HASD&IC 2019 CHNA), which was based on t he collaboration of representatives from seven local San Diego hospitals called the CHNA Committee. The CHNA Committee (listed below) actively participated in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process , elements of which are described within this report.

In particular , we are grateful to those patients and community residents who shared their personal insight regarding health care access and challenges to health and wel l-being. Sharp HealthCare (Sharp) would like to extend our deepest thanks for the contributio ns made by all who participated in the 2019 CHNA process. Further, Sharp is committed to providing a CHNA that is valuable to all our community partners, and we look forward to strengthening that value and those community partnerships in the years to come. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 1 Section 1 History & Background Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH) is located at 7901 Frost Street in San Diego, ZIP code 92123. Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns ( SMBHWN ) is located at 3003 Health Center Drive in San Diego, ZIP code 92123 . History During the 1950s, San Diego's leadership planted the seeds that would blossom into a vibrant city. The city's population grew more than 30 percent, to more than 400,000 people, and the community's health care needed to change with the times. Rancher and radio communications pioneer Thomas E. Sharp provided the first of several donations from individuals, families and businesses to build th e Donald N. Sharp Memorial Community Hospital , in memory of his son, U.S. Army Air Corps Lt. Donald N. Sharp, who was killed in World War II . The hospital was a visionary, community -wide effort to transform health care in S an Diego County (SDC). From the beginning, this was a health care organization designed for people, not profit. A major expansion of the SMH campus began immediately following its opening in 1955, and included the joint development of a heart -lung machine for use in open -heart surgery; t he first major long -term rehabilitation center specializing in care for patients with spinal cord, stroke and brain injuries; and a $1.78 million maternity wing called the \"Stork Club,\" which demonstrated the hospital's commitment to offer state -of-the-art obstetrical and gynecological services to the women of SDC. By its second decade, SMH had become a recognized leader in SDC for cardiac care, rehabilitation and maternity services. Once -dramatic advances like SDC's first implantable pacemaker and first o pen-heart surgery became commonplace. SMH was the region's newest and most modern hospital, and its destiny was to grow with SDC, becoming the area's most comprehensive center for health care. By 1980 \u2014 the year of its silver jubilee \u2014 SMH was providing a n extraordinary range of clinical services in facilities that had grown fourfold to meet the community's needs. The hospital would become the cornerstone of today's Sharp HealthCare. As medical science advanced rapidly into the area of high technology, SM H physicians performed the most cardiac catheterizations and cardiac surgeries in the region. The hospital brought the first computerized tomography scanner to SDC, and its staff was at the forefront of transplantation, using artificial hearts and performi ng the region's first Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 2 heart transplant. During the 1980s and 1990s, SMH became the single largest provider of acute care services in SDC. A growing reputation for excellence attracted clinicians and staff from around the world , which continues to this day . In 1985, SMH opened a level II neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which offered an optimal, nurturing environment for babies to grow, heal and receive high -quality medical care. By 1986, more than 6,500 babies were born at the hospital each year , including many high -risk premature babies, leading SMH to rank among the best hospitals for obstetric and neonatal care in California and the nation . In 1989, the Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation donated $5 million to name SDC's first women's hospital after the couple's only daughter, Mary. The campaign for the new women's hospital was Sharp HealthCare Foundation's first -ever fundraising effort , raising $15 million for the $46 million hospital. It also marked the transition of women's and maternal servi ces from SMH to the new Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns . SMBHWN officially opened in 1992 and remains SDC's only specialty hospital dedicated exclusively to caring for women and newborns. SMBHWN is proud to deliver over 8,000 babies annuall y \u2014 more than any other hospital in California. More than 1,000 of these babies each year are premature or high -risk newborn s that require specialized care in the NICU . Additionally, more than 130 babies are transferred from other area hospitals to the SMB HWN NICU each year. The SMBHWN NICU has the capacity to care for up to 84 infants at a time and ranks in the top four centers in the nation for NICU infecti on prevention . In May 2019, SMBHWN announced that the world's smallest surviving baby had been born at the hospital and cared for in the NICU before being discharged home. Newborns at SMBHWN also benefit from the breakthrough discoveries happening at the hospital's Neonatal Research Institute (NRI). Bringing together a multidisciplinary team of experts, the NRI works to identify and disseminate best practices in newborn care to improve the outcomes of at -risk infants. Leading -edge discoveries happening at the NRI hold the potential to transform the way newborns are cared for across the country. The Perin atal Special Care Unit at SMBHWN provides expert care for women who experience premature labor, or whose pregnancies have been complicated by conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure. The hospital has more affiliated maternal -fetal medicine speci alists than any other hospital in San Diego \u2014 including 24/7 in -house coverage for OBGYN, anesthesia and neonatology \u2014 bringing advanced training and experience to high -risk pregnancies. Women who are admitted to this unit receive specialized treatment in the hospital while they await the delivery of their new baby. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 3 SMBHWN also provides a range of women's services in a healing environment specifically tailored to the care and comfort of women. The hospital offers a private unit dedicated exclusively to wome n's surgery, and expert caregivers specialize in the latest minimally invasive procedures, including robotic gynecologic surgery. Now in its seventh decade, and with the dedication and commitment of more than 1,160 physicians and 3,600 employees, SMH's leadership looks to the future. As was the case a half -century before, health care in SDC is in need of dramatic transformation to ensure clinical superiority for the community of tomorrow. On the site where Thomas E. Sharp first pledged a hospital t o the memory of his heroic son, stands one of the most modern, technologically advanced and patient -centered care centers in the United States (U.S.). In January 2009, SMH opened the Stephen Birch Healthcare Center , which was the first new hospital in San Diego in 15 years , at the time . True to its history, the new hospital was the product of its dedicated community, its visionary staff and its countless financial supporters. Together, they embody the spirit of caring and excellence that has become the legacy of Lt. Donald N. S harp. The 315,000 -square -foot, 656 -bed facility include d many design elements inspired by the caregivers who work there and the philosophy of patient -centered care. Re - designated as a Planetree Patient -Centered Hospital with Distinction for the third time in 2015, SMH is dedicated to providing whole -person care and empowering patients and families through information and education. The patient -centered experience at SMH includes the Arts for Healing Program, health information ambassadors, integrative healing, spiritual care, and interpreter services. The SMH Emergency and Trauma Center is the largest in the county, having increased in size nearly 300 percent since its inception. With 52 private patient rooms and four trauma bays, the center was consciousl y designed to reduce stress and waiting time. The level II trauma center is part of SDC's Trauma System \u2014 a partnership launched in 1984 that includes five other designated trauma centers in the county. SDC's Trauma System is a national leader in organized , efficient, and exception trauma care. SMH continues its tradition as one of the county's largest providers of acute care services and one of the busiest single hospitals in SDC. SMH provides outstanding programs in cardiac care, cancer treatment, ortho pedics, rehabilitation, bariatric surgery and organ transplantation. SMBHWN specializes in labor and delivery services, high - risk pregnancy, obstetrics, gynecology, gynecologic oncology and neonatal intensive care. For a complete listing of the programs an d services provided at SMH and SMBHWN, please refer to Appendix A . SMH is part of Sharp HealthCare \u2014 an integrated, regional health care delivery system based in San Diego, Calif ornia . The Sharp system includes fou r acute care hospitals; three specialty hospitals; three affiliated medical groups; 29 medical clinics; six urgent care centers ; three skilled nursing facilities; two inpatient rehabilitatio n centers; home health, hospice and home infusion programs; numerous outpatient facilities and Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 4 programs; and a variety of community health education programs and other related services. Sharp offers a full continuum of care, including but not limited to emergency and urgent care service s, home care, hospice and palliative care, inpatient and outpatient care, primary and specialty care, long-term care, mental health services , and rehabilitation. Sharp also offers individual and group Health Maintenance Organization coverage through Sharp Health Plan. Sharp serves a population of approximately 3. 3 million in SDC and as of September 30, 2018 , is licensed to operate 2,0 84 beds. It is Sharp's mission to improve the health of those it serves with a commitment to excellence in all that it does . Sharp's goal is to offer quality care and services that set community standards, exceed patient expectations and are provided in a caring, convenient, cost -effective and accessible manner. More than 2,700 affiliated physicians and 18,000 employees are de dicated to providing the extraordinary level of care that is called The Sharp Experience. Please refer to Appendix B for a detailed overview of the Sharp HealthCare system. Background: Sharp HealthCare CHNA For the past 20 years, Sharp has been actively involved in a triennial community health needs assessment (CHNA) process. This process began in 1995, in accordance with the requirements of Senate Bill 697 (SB 697), community benefit legislation that require s not -for-profit hospitals in California to file a triennial CHNA that identifies community health needs. Further, t he Sharp Memorial Hospital 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment ( SMH 2019 CHNA ) responds to more recent Interna l Revenue Service ( IRS) regulatory requiremen ts that private not -for-profit hospitals conduct and make publicly available a triennial CHNA and corresponding implementation strategy. The implementation strategy identifies and details current or planned strategies intended to address the needs identified in the hospital's CHNA. SB 697 also requires submission of an annual community benefit report to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) that describes programs and services provided to address those identified community health needs within their mission and financial capacity , as well as the financial value of those programs and services . To view the most recent Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report, please visit: http://www.sharp.com/about/community/community -benefits -health - needs.cfm . Beginning participated in a countywide collaborative that includ es a broad range of hospitals, health care organizations, and community agencies to conduct a triennial CHNA. Findings from th e CHNA , program and services expertise of each Sharp hospital, and knowledge of the populations and communities served by those hosp itals provide a foundation for community benefit programs and implementation strategies . Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 5 With the passing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , since 2013 Sharp has participated in a countywide CHNA effort under the auspices of the Hospital Association of San Diego & Imperial Counties ( HASD&IC ) and in contract with the Institute for Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State University (SDSU) . Sharp partners with other San Diego hospitals and health systems (the CHNA Committee), on this countywide CHNA, which significantly informs both the process and findings for each of the CHNAs completed by Sharp hospitals. Although only not -for-profit 501(c)(3) hospitals and health systems are subject to state and IRS regulatory requirements, the 201 9 CHNA Committee includes hospitals and health systems who are not subject to any CHNA requirements, but who are deeply engaged in the communities they serve and committed to the goals of a collaborative CHNA. For the 201 9 CHNA, the HASD&IC Board of Directors c onvened a CHNA Committee to plan and implement the collaborative CHNA process. The CHNA Committee is comprised of representatives from all seven participating hospitals and health care systems: Kaiser Foundation Hospital - San Diego Palomar Health Rady C hildren's Hospital - San Diego Scripps Health (Chair) Sharp HealthCare (Vice Chair) Tri-City Medical Center University of California (UC) San Diego Health In Spring 2018 , HASD&IC contracted with the IPH at SDSU to provide assistance with the collaborativ e health needs assessment that was officially called the Hospital Association of San Diego & Imperial Counties 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment ( HASD&IC 2019 CHNA). The purpose of the collaborative HASD&IC 2019 CHNA was to identify, understand and pr ioritize the health -related needs of the people of SDC . This was accomplished through two types of data collection: (1) qualitative data was collected through a community engagement process designed to solicit in -depth feedback from residents in high -need neighborhoods and from lo cal health experts and leaders; and (2) quantitative data was collected by extracting and analyzing data from secondary data sources.2 The results of the collaborative HASD&IC 2019 CHNA proce ss significantly informed the SM H 2019 CHNA and was further supported by additional data analysis and community engagement activities specif ic to the community served by SMH. The findings of the SM H 2019 CHNA will be used to help guide current and future community he alth programs and services a t SMH, particularly for high need co mmunity 2 The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention ( CDC ) defines secondary data as data that has been collected by another ent ity or for another purpose. Common sources for secondary data include the U.S. Census Bureau, California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), and OSHPD. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 6 members. In addition, SM H will develop and make publicly available, its three -year implementation strategy to address the needs identified through the SM H 2019 CHNA process. 2016 CHNA: Progress Update Upon completion of the Hospital Association of San Diego & Imperial Counties 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment ( HASD&IC 2016 CHNA ), the CHNA Committee reviewed all data in accordance with their own patient communities, determined their capacity to address the identified health needs, and evaluate d opportunities for next steps . This process guided the development of Sharp's implementation strategies, which detail the programs, services and collaborations designed to address identified community health needs. Sharp hospital implementation strategies are updated annually and are available to the public on Sharp.com at: https://www.sharp.com/about/community/comm unity -benefits/health -needs - assessments.cfm . Notable implementation strategies and program developments for SMH since the completion of the Sharp Memorial Hospital 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (SMH 2016 CHNA ) are described in Table 1 below. Table 1: Implementation Strategy Updates, S MH 2016 CHNA SELECT 2016 SMH IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY UPDATES, BY IDENTIFIED NEED ACCESS TO CARE Continuation of multiple programs within Sharp Patient Access Services to offer financial support and programs for patients needing advanced guidance on available funding options Continue to facilitate CalFresh (SNAP) applications for patients through Patient Access Services Continue to provide Project HELP funds for pharmaceuticals, transportation vouchers and oth er needs for economically disadvantaged patients Creation of a Sharp Homeless Task Force (internal) led by Sharp Integrated Care Management, including hospital ( SMH ) leaders.

The behavioral health needs of SMH's patient community are addressed through the progra ms/services provided through Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital ( SMV ) and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major providers of behavioral health and substance use services in San Diego County. SMV is located on the same campus as SMH Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 7 CANCER Continued provision of cancer patient navigator programs to assist cancer throughout San Diego; includes facilitation of connection to community resources and special focus on both the clinical and social service needs of community members impacted by cancer Continued provis ion of extensive cancer education, screening and support programs through the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute - both onsite as well as out in the community in support of cancer awareness events and community -based organizations CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE includes CEREBROVASCULAR HEALTH) Continued provision of community education classes and support groups for community members impacted by heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure; includes community education on risk factors and preventive care to maintain cardiovascular health; resources provided both onsite and at community sites throughout San Diego Continued participation in the San Diego County Stroke Consortium DIABETES Continued provision of diabetes education through partnerships with community clinics and participation in educational forums, health fairs and events throughout San Diego Continued provision of diabetes education and resources to high -risk, underserved pregnant women with diabetes through the California Diabetes and Pregnancy Program's Sweet Success Program Continued provision and development of language -appropriate and culturally sensitive diabetes educational materials HIGH RISK PREGNANCY Continued provision of free monthly preterm birth prevention classes on the warning signs of preterm labor and preventing preterm births.

Two community surveys were conducted \u2014 the first in the fall of 2016 and the second in the summer of 2017. The results of these community surveys helped guide individual hospital programs and greatly informed the design of the 2019 CHNA process. The survey in fall of 2016 sought to gather feedback on the identified top four health needs and the top 10 SDOH that were identified in the 2016 CHNA. In ad dition, organizations were asked about their screening methods for behavioral health issues and methods for identifying SDOH . Of the 132 respondents that completed the survey, 30 worked in hospitals or hospital - based settings, while the remaining 102 resp ondents self -identified as working for a range of entities including but not limited to community clinics, not -for-profits, community -based organizations, local government, and health insurance plans. Key findings from the survey included: Nearly 98% of respondents agreed (33.3%) or strongly agreed (64.4%) that behavioral health, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity are the top health needs of commun ities facing inequities within SDC . 99% of respondents agreed (33.0%) or strongly agreed ( 66.1%) that the top ten SDOH identified by the 2016 CHNA represented the greatest barriers for communities facing inequities within SDC . Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 9 Nearly 72% of respondents are likely (40.0%) or very likely (31.8%) to use the findings and/or data that resulted from the CHNA to help inform their programs in the grant writing process. A second community feedback survey was conducted in the summer of 2017. Community feedback was gathered in order to understand how the health and social needs of communities facing ine quity had changed over the past year. Feedback was collected in several key areas, including: 1. How has access to care changed over the past 12 months. 2. Ways that hospitals can work more effectively with community organizations to ensure that patients are tr eated in the most appropriate setting. 3. How are patients'/clients' concerns about their immigration status impacting their access to needed health care. 4. Given the federal policies and budget cuts that are under consideration, what are the greatest challenge s in the community's ability to address SDOH . The full results of the HASD&IC 2016 CHNA Phase 2 can be found on the HASD&IC website, https://hasdic.org/ . Lastly, in 2017, the HASD&IC Board of Directors asked the CHNA Committee to conduct a focused analysis of the challenges to treating behavioral health patients in San Diego . The CHNA Committee adopted a methodology similar to 2013 and 2016 CHNAs that used focus groups, key informant interviews, and hospital discharge data. Issues examined included pre -acute, acute, and post -acute services and the impact of SDOH on access and outcomes. Throughout the interviews and focus groups, the most consistent theme was that patients are unable to access or are continuously delayed in accessing needed behavioral health services at every point across the continuum. The analysis found that e ven when clinical services are available, patients face many challenges to successfully managing their behavioral health conditions on thei r own. SDOH w ere identified as the most frequent barriers to creating a safe discharge plan. Please see the full report for the complete list of findings and recommendations \u2014 2018 HASD&IC Behavioral Health Analysis Summary Report: available at https://hasdic.org/key -issues/ . Sharp 2016 CHNA: Phase 2 Sharp also conducted a 2016 CHNA Phase 2 analysis in contract with the IPH, similar to but distinct from the HASD&IC 2016 CHNA Phase 2. Sharp's 2016 CHNA Phase 2 process was conducted from December 2016 through December 2017. Sharp's 2016 CHNA Phase 2 consisted of a deeper analysis of the Sharp 2016 CHNA findings through follow -up with community partners and Sharp staff/community members who participated in Sharp' s 2016 CHNA process. Please refer to Appendi x D for detailed findings of the Sharp 2016 CHNA Phase 2 process. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 10 In addition, an analysis of programs in Sharp's implementation strategies (conducted as part of the HAS D&IC 2016 CHNA Phase 2) combined with findings from Sharp's 2016 CHNA Phase 2 contributed to the development of a new document for community members \u2014 the Sharp CHNA Community Guide. The Sharp CHNA Community Guide was developed to provide community members with a more user -friendly document to learn about Sharp's CHNA process, findings and implementation strategy programs. The Sharp CHNA Community Guide also clearly identifies and connects the health and social needs addressed through Sharp hospital programs included in the implementation strategies . In addition, the Sharp CHNA Community Guide includes a direct link for community members to provide feedback on Sharp's CHNA process. The most current (2016) Sharp CHNA Community Guide is publicly available on Sharp.com at: https://www.sharp.com/about/community/community -benefits/health - needs -assessments.cfm . Please refer to Appendix E for the Sharp CHNA Community Guide developed in 2016 . An updated Sharp CHNA Community Guide will be available in 2020. Findings from both the Sharp and HASD&IC 2016 CHNA Phase 2 processes provided essential guid ance f or the Sharp (including SM H) and HASD&IC 2019 CHNAs, the processes and findings of which are detailed in the following pages. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 11 Section 2 Executive Summary Introduction and Background Sharp HealthCare (Sharp) has been a long -time partner in the process of identifying and responding to the health needs of the San Diego community . This partnership includes a broad range of hospitals, health care organizations, and community agencies that have worked together to conduct triennial Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) for more than 20 years. Previous collaborations among not -for-profit hospitals and other community partners have resulted in numerous well-regarded CHNA reports . Sharp hospitals, including Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH), base their community benefit and community health programs on both the findings of these needs assessments and the combination of expertise in programs and services offered and the knowledge of the populations and communities served by each Sharp hospital . SMH prepared this CHNA for Fiscal Year 2019 (FY 2019) in accordance with the requirements of Section 501(r)(3) within Section 9007 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) enacted in March 2010 , and Internal Revenue Service ( IRS) Form 990, Schedule H for not -for-profit hospitals.3 Per the federal regulations, the SMH 2019 CHNA also includes needs identified for communities served by Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns ( SMBHWN ), as the two hospitals share a license, and report all utilization and financial data as a single entity to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. The SMH 2019 CHNA summarizes the processes and findings for communities served by both hospital entities. The Sharp Memorial Hospital 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment (SMH 2019 CHNA ) examines the health needs of the community members it serves in San Diego County (SDC). SMH's 2019 CHNA process and findings are based on the collaborative Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment (HA SD&IC 2019 CHNA) process and findings for SDC. The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA is implemented and managed by a standing CHNA Committee comprised of representatives from seven hospitals and health systems. Sharp is an integral hospital partner in the HASD&IC 2019 C HNA. This Committee reports to the HASD&IC Board of Directors who provide policy direction and ensure that the interests of all member hospitals and health systems are met. HASD&IC contracts with the Institute for Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State Uni versity (SDSU) to perform the needs assessment. The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Committee includes representatives from the following San Diego hospitals and health care systems: 3 See Section 9007(a) of the Patient P rotection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), Pub. L. No. 111 -148, 124 Stat.119, enacted March 23, 2010. Notice 2011 -52. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 12 Kaiser Foundation Hospital - San Diego Palomar Health Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego Scripps Health (Chair) Sharp HealthCare (Vice Chair) Tri-City Medical Center University of California (UC) San Diego Health The process and findings of the collaborative HASD&IC 2019 CHNA significantly informed the SMH 2019 CHNA and was further supported by additional data analysis and community engagement activities specific to the community served by SMH and SMBHWN . The findings of the SMH 2019 CHNA will be used to help guide current and future community health programs and serv ices at SMH , particularly for high need community members. In addition, SMH will develop and make publicly available its three -year implementation strategy \u2014 a federally -required written strategy to address the needs identified through the SMH 2019 CHNA pr ocess The CHNA is considered adopted once it has been made widely available to the public. In addition, the CHNA and the implementation strategy must be approved by an authorized governing body of the hospital facility. 2019 CHNA Objectives The 2019 CHN A processes (HASD&IC and Sharp) built on the results of the 2016 CHNA and included three types of community engagement efforts: focus groups with residents, patients and their family members, community -based organizations, service providers, and health car e leaders; key informant (KI) interviews with health care experts; and online survey s for residents , patients and stakeholders. In addition, the CHNA included extensive quantitative analysis of national and state -wide data sets, SDC emergency department (ED) and inpatient hospital discharge data, community clinic usage data, county mortality and morbidity data, and data related to social determinants of health (SDOH) . These different approaches allowed for the capability to view community health needs from multiple perspectives. Specific objectives of the 2019 CHNA process included: To identify, understand and prioritize the health -related needs of the people of SDC , especially those community members served by Sharp . Provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in SDC , and to inform and guide local hospitals in the development of their programs and strategies that address identified community health needs . Build on and strengthen community partnerships established through the 2016 C HNA processes . Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 13 Obtain deeper feedback from and about specific vulnerable populations in SDC . Align with national best practices around CHNA development and implementation , including the integration of health conditions with SDOH. Community Defined For the purposes of the collaborative HASD&IC 2019 CHNA , the study area is the entire County of San Diego due to a broad representation of hospitals in the area. More than three million people live in socially and ethnically diverse SDC . Information on key demo graphics, socioeconomic factors, access to care, health behaviors, and the physical environment can be found in the full HASD&IC 2019 CHNA report at: https://hasdic.org/2019 -chna/ . The the communities served by both SMH and SMBHWN. As a specialty hospital providing care for expectant mothers, newborns and wome n's services, SMBHWN serves the entire community of SDC . Combined with the communities served by SMH, the study are a for the SMH 201 9 CHNA covers includes all six regions of SDC : central, east, north central, north coastal, north inland and south. Table 2 below presents the ZIP codes where the majority of SMH/SMBHWN patients reside.

Methodology The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process and findings significantly informed the SMH 2019 CHNA process and as such are described as applicable throughout this report. For complete details on the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process, please visit the HASD&IC website at: https://hasdic.org/2019 -chna/ or contact Lindsey . For the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA , quantitative analyses of publicly available data provided an overview of critical health issues across SDC , while qualitative analyses of feedback from the community provided an appreciation for the experiences and needs of San Diegans. The CHNA Committee reviewed these analyses and applied a pre -determined set of criteria to them to prioritize the top health needs in SDC . This process is represented in Figure 1 below . Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 15 Figure 1: HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Process Map Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 16 Quantitative /Secondary Data Quantitative data were drawn from several public sources to support the HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNAs . Data from the Dignity Health CNI and the Public Health Alliance of Southern California's Healthy Places Index were used to identify geograp hic communities in SDC that were more likely to be experiencing health inequities, which guided the selection of communities /individuals for community engagement activities (described below), as well as the development of community engagement questions. Hospital discharge data exported from SpeedTrack 's California Universal Patient Information Discovery (CUPID ) application were used to identify current and three -year trends in primary diagnosis discharge categories and were stratified by age and race. This allowed for the identification of health disparities and the conditions having the greatest impact on hospitals and health systems in SDC . Data from national and state -wide data sets were analyzed including SDC mortality and morbidity data, and data r elated to SDOH . In addition, Kaiser Permanente (KP) consolidated data from several national and state -wide data sets related to a variety of health conditions and SDOH in SDC and conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis to identify which SDOH were most predictive of negative health outcomes. KP then created a web -based data platform (chna.org/kp) to post these analyses for use in the CHNA. Analysis specific to SMH and SMBHWN inpatient and SMH ED data was also conducted in addition to the ana lyses described above. Further, Sharp Cancer Registry Data was also incorporated into the SMH 2019 CHNA quantitative analyses. Community Engagement HASD&IC 2019 CHNA c ommunity engagement activities included focus groups, KI interviews, and an online sur vey which targeted stakeholders from every region of SDC , all age groups, and numerous racial and ethnic groups. Collaboration with the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, Public Health Services was vital to this process. A t otal of 79 individuals participated in the 2019 CHNA: 138 community residents and 441 leaders and experts. Please see Figure 2 below for details on the types of participants engaged. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 17 Figure 2: HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA - Summary of Community Engagement Activities In addition to an active role in the collaborative HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process, Sharp contracted separately with the IPH at SDSU to conduct a number of community engagement activities to collect input specifically from Sharp providers as well as from patient s and community members served by Sharp hospitals. This input focused on behavioral health, cancer, diabetes, maternal health and prenatal care, senior health (now termed aging concerns), and the needs of highly vulnerable patients and community members. These additional efforts included focus groups and key informant interviews involving 50 Sharp providers and 14 patients/community members. Further , IPH created case studies with the intent of representing a \"typical\" patient experience within Sharp. The ca se studies focused specifically on breast cancer and high -risk pregnancy. Data collected during the community engagement activities and from literature reviews supported development of the case studies . Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 18 Lastly, the SMH 2019 CHNA community engagement proces s included a robust online survey conducted through the Sharp Insight Community. The Sharp Insight Community is a private online environment for Sharp patients and their families, community members, Sharp employees, and Sharp -affiliated physicians . The 201 9 CHNA Sharp Insight Community online survey sought to obtain feedback on the top health and social need s faced by SDC community members, as well as assess their awareness of community outreach programs offered by Sharp. The online survey also provided participants the opportunity to provide specific suggestions for Sharp to improve community health and well -being. A total o f 380 community members completed the online survey. Figure 3 below summarizes SMH 2019 CHNA community engagement: Figure 3: SMH 2019 CHNA - Summary of Community Engagement Activities Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 19 Prioritization of 2019 Health Needs The CHNA Committee collectively reviewed the quantitative and qualitative data and findings. Several criteria were applied to the data to determine which health conditions were of the highest priority in SDC . These criteria included: the severity of the need ; the magnitude/scale of the need; disparities or in equities; and change over time. Those health conditions and SDOH that met the largest number of criteria we re then selected as top priority community health needs. As the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process included robust representation from the communities served by SMH , this prioritization process was replicated for the SMH 2019 CHNA. Findings : Top 10 Community Hea lth Needs The 2019 CHNA Committee identified the following as the highest priority community health needs in SDC, (in alphabetical order by SDOH or health condition). Figure 4: HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Top 10 Community Health Needs for San Diego County Figure 4 above illustrates the interactive nature of SDOH and health conditions \u2014 each impacting the other. In addition, an underlying theme of stigma and the barriers it creates arose across 2019 CHNA community engagement activities . For instance, stigma impacts the way in which people access needed services that address SDOH, which consequentially impacts their ability to maintain and manage health conditions. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 20 These same findings were supported throu gh both the quantitative analyse s and community engage ment activities conducted as part of the SMH 2019 CHNA . In addition, Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy , was also identified as a community health need by the SMH 2019 CHNA. Description of Identified Needs Access to health care . Overcoming barriers to health care, such as lack of health insurance and insurance issues, economic insecurity, transportation, the shortage of culturally competent care, fears about immigration status, and the shortage of health care providers emerged a s a high priority community need. In addition, specific services were identified as challenging to obtain, including behavioral health care, dental care, primary care, and specialty care. Aging concerns . Conditions that predominantly affect people who ar e 65 and older \u2014 such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, falls, and limited mobility \u2014 were identified as a high priority health need. Community engagement participants most often described aging concerns in relation to the SDOH, includ ing: transportation, access to fresh food, social isolation and inadequate family support, and economic insecurity. Behavioral health . Greater access to behavioral health care was cited as a priority health need. Three types of behavioral health care we re identified as challenging to access: urgent care services for crisis situations; inpatient psychiatric beds and substance abuse facilities; and transitional programs and services for post -acute care. In addition, several barriers to behavioral health ca re were named as priorities to address, including a lack of availability of needed services and appointments, insurance issues, logistical issues, such as transportation and time off work, and the inability to pay co -pays and deductibles. Cancer . Health needs related to cancer were described in relation to the effects on well - being beyond physical health. These include financial, practical, and emotional impacts on individuals and families; these effects are exacerbated by barriers to cancer care. Chroni c conditions . Three chronic conditions were identified as priorities: cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and obesity . Key factors that individuals struggle with to prevent chronic diseases include access to fresh, healthy foods and safe places to exercise a nd play. In addition, economic issues, transportation to medical care, fears about immigration status, and a lack of knowledge about chronic conditions were named as particular challenges related to the management of chronic conditions. Community and soc ial support . A high priority for the well -being of San Diego residents is ensuring that individuals have adequate resources and substantial support within their neighborhood. Valuable neighborhood resources include Federally Qualified H ealth Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 21 Centers and th ose that are culturally and linguistically competent. Without adequate support from others, community engagement and community spirit are affected. Economic security . Economic security was described as a vital social factor impacting every aspect of San Diegans' daily lives. The health of the economically insecure is worsened by food insecurity, chronic stress and anxiety, and reduced capability to manage health needs. Economically insecure community members are at greater risk of poor mental health days , asthma, obesity, diabetes, stroke, cancer, smoking, pedestrian injury and visits to the ED for heart attacks. Low wages, housing and childcare costs were identified as contributors to economic insecurity. Education . Receiving a high school diploma, hav ing the opportunity to pursue higher or vocational education, being health literate, and having opportunities for non -academic continuing education were identified as important priorities for the health and well -being of San Diego residents. Family stress and a lack of school and community resources were identified as factors underlying low levels of educational attainment. Homelessness and housing instability . Homelessness and housing instability were identified as critical factors affecting the health o f San Diegans. Serious health impacts of these issues were cited, including increased exposure to infectious disease, substantial challenges in chronic disease and wound care management (e.g., asthma), and increased stress and anxiety. Maternal and prena tal care, including high -risk pregnancy. Maternal and prenatal care were cited as critical components of health and well -being. Maternal health is often complicated by co -existing health conditions including diabetes, preterm pregnancies, substance use, po stpartum depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders. In addition, a number of SDOH present obstacles to maternal and prenatal care, such as lack of access to mental health services (even for those patients with insurance), lack of transportation, and ec onomic stress related to childcare and maternity leave. Unintentional injury and violence . Exposure to violence and neighborhood safety were cited as priority health needs for San Diegans. Neighborhood safety was discussed as influencing residents' abilit y to maintain good health, while exposure to violence was described as traumatic and impactful on mental health. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 22 Community Assets & Recommendations The 2019 CHNA identified many health resources in SDC , including those provided by community -based organizations, government departments and agencies, hospital and clinic partners, and other community members and organizations engaged in addressing many of the health needs identified by this assessment. In addition, 2 -1-1 San Diego is an important commu nity resource and information hub that facilitates access to services. Through its 24/7 phone service and online database, as well as a host of innovative navigation and support programs, 2-1-1 San Diego helps connect individuals with community, health, an d disaster services. 2-1-1 San Diego researched their database using relevan t sear ch terms for each identified need . The number of resources located for each need are listed below : Aging Concerns: 91 Access to Care: 260 Behavioral Health: 703 Cancer: 129 Cardiovascular Disease: 161 Diabetes: 144 Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy: 251 Obesity: 298 Social Determinants of Health: 5,836 (transportation, food access, etc.) In addition to community input on health conditions and SDO H, a wealth of ideas emerged from community engagement participants about how hospitals and health systems could support additional resources and partner with organizations to help meet San Diego's community health needs. Figure 5 below outlines types of r esources identified by community engagement participants: Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 23 Figure 5: HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Resources & Opportunities Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 24 Further, as part of Sharp's 2016 CHNA Phase 2 process, the Sharp CHNA Community Guide was developed in response to the 2016 CHNA and made publicly available on Sharp.com at: https://www.sharp.com/about/community/ community -benefits/health - needs -assessments.cfm . The Sharp CHNA Community Guide seeks to provide community members with a user -friendly resource to learn about Sharp's CHNA process and findings, as well as the identified health and social needs addressed through Sharp programs. The Sharp CHNA Community Guide also provides a direct link for community members to provide feedback on Sharp's CHNA. An updated Sharp CHNA Community Guide will be publicly available on Sharp's website during early - to mid- 2020. Implementation Strategy SMH developed its FY 2020 - FY 2023 Implementation Strategy to address the needs identified through the 2019 CHNA process for the community served by both SMH and SMBHWN . Many of the programs included in the implementation strategy h ave been in place at SMH or SMBHWN for several years. SMH and SMBHWN leadership, Sharp Community Benefit and team members across Sharp are committed to an ongoing evaluation of the programs provided to address the needs of SMH's community members. The SMH FY 2020 - FY 2023 Implementation Strategy is submitted along with the IRS Form 990, Schedule H, and will be publicly available on Guidestar (http://www.guidestar.org/ ) in the coming months. Categories of programs a nd activities included in the SMH FY 2020 - FY 2023 Implementation Strategy are summarized in Table 4 below: Table 4: SMH FY 2020 - FY 2023 Implementation Strategy Summary SMH FY 2020 - FY 2023 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY SUMMARY, BY IDENTIFIED NEED ACCESS TO CARE & HEALTH INSURANCE Provision of \"Public Resource Specialist\" position in Sharp Patient Financial Services ( PAS) to offer support for underinsured and uninsured patients needing advanced guidance on available funding options Increase coverage for p atients seen in the ED by providing assistance to secure health coverage for all individuals entitled to the benefit; also provide payment options for individuals that chose not to secure coverage or are not current ly eligible for health benefits Provide P roject HELP funds for pharmaceuticals, transportation vouchers and other needs for econ omically disadvantaged patients Sharp Integrated Care Management (ICM) is working more collaboratively with Sharp PA S to ensure patients are aware of all funding opportu nities for which they may be eligible Participation in the one -year pilot/partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego Community Information Exchange (CIE) to increase assessment for social determinant of health needs (SDOH) and connection to community resources addr essing those SDOH needs AGING CONCERNS Provide seasonal flu vaccines to seniors with limited mobility and who lack transportation ( SMH Senior Resource Center and Sharp Senior Health Centers ) Host a variety of community senior health education and screening programs in order to raise health education/awareness, identify risk factors and connect seniors and caregivers to resources ( SMH Senior Resource Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 25 Center and Sharp Senior Health Centers ); collaborate with Sharp HospiceCare for annual community education events for caregivers Continue collaborations with organizations that support social services for seniors in need (e.g. San Diego Food Bank partnership) Maintain active relationships with community organizations serving seniors throughout SDC (board service, financial support, event management, etc.) BEHAVIORAL HEALTH Psychiatric Evaluation Team (PET) evaluations in the SMH Emergency Department Behavioral health education/outreach programs addressed primarily through Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital (on the Sharp Metropolitan Medical Campus) and Sharp McDonald Center Participation in the one -year pilot/partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego Community Information Exchange (CIE) to increase assessment for social determinant of health needs (SDOH) and connection t o community resources addressing those SDOH needs CANCER Provide free education and support programs for community members with cancer diagnoses, and their families/loved ones Provide ongoing social and psychosocial supports to community member with cancer diagnoses , including linkages to community -based resources that address social determinants Continue to provide cancer prevention education and resources to the broader community Participation in the one -year pilot/partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego C ommunity Information Exchange (CIE) to increase assessment for social determinant of health needs (SDOH) and connection to community resources addressing those SDOH needs CARDIOVASCULAR Provide free bimonthly cardiac education classes, and monthly conges tive heart failure education classes and support groups Provide educational sessions on heart disease and cardiovascular health for SDC's east region, as well as blood pressure screenings Continued participation in the San Diego County Stroke Consortium Through the City of San Diego partnership, provide stroke education and resources to City employees as well as community residents Provide weekly support groups for stroke survivors and their families COMMUNITY & SOCIAL SUPPORT Participation in the one-year pilot/partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego Community Information Exchange (CIE) to increase assessment for social determinant of health needs (SDOH) and connection to community resources addressing those SDOH needs Ongoing screenings, support and refe rrals provided through SMH Case Management and Social Work DIABETES Increase education of signs and symptoms of diabetes in SDC through participation in community educational forums and health fairs and events Provide diabetes education to high -risk pregnant women with diabetes through affiliation with the CA Diabetes and Pregnancy Program's \"Sweet Success\" Program and in collaboration with community clinics who serve underserved pregnant women with diabetes (in FY 2018, SMH served more than 375 women through this program) Collaborate with community clinics (i.e., Family Health Centers of San Diego) to provide diabetes education classes at clinic sites Offer and create language -appropriate and culturally sensitive diabetes educational materials.

Sharp will conti nue to work with HASD&IC and IPH as part of the CHNA Committee to develop and implement Phase 2 of the 2019 CHNA. Phase 2 will focus on continued engagement of community partners to analyze and improve the CHNA process, as well as refine hospital implement ation strategies. Thus, the CHNA process will evolve to meet the needs of San Diegans and support the work of our community partners who also address identified community health needs. This will include a deeper dive into the impact of stigma on health, an d an exploration of how hospitals may help address this impact. In addition, in the first year of Sharp's FY 2020 - FY 2023 Implementation Strategy, Sharp hospitals (including SMH/SMBHWN ), medical groups, and health plans are embarking on a new, innovativ e partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego's Community Information Exchange (CIE). The CIE includes a longitudinal client record with community member history, access to and utilization of social programs (e.g., housing, food banks, community clinics, etc.), emerg ency transport data, and much more. The CIE also includes a direct -referral feature, which allows for documented, bi -directional, close d-loop referrals between all CIE partners \u2014 including hospitals, clinics, and social service programs. Currently, there a re more than 60 community partners (organizations) participating in CIE, and more than 100,000 community members enrolled, with approximately 4,500 new community members enrolled each month. Sharp HealthCare is the first integrated health system \u2014 includin g its hospitals, medical groups and health plan \u2014 to wholly participate in the CIE ; that is, implementing utilization beyond individual hospitals. By leveraging this technology, and expanding upon this capability for shared data, consistent tracking and ro bust reporting, the CIE partnership presents an exciting opportunity for Sharp to strengthen and evaluate the impact of clinical - community linkages for its patients and community members in need, particularly regarding SDOH. The data collected in this one -year partnership will inform the value case for continuing with the partnership after the pilot year (Summer 2020). The complete Sharp Memorial Hospital 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment will be available for public download by September 30, 2019 at: http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . The report is also available by contacting Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit at: communitybenefits@sharp.com . Sharp extends our deepest thanks for the contributions made by all who participated in the 2019 CHNA process. Further, Sharp is committed to providing a CHNA that is valuable to all our community partners, and we look forward to strengthening that value and those commu nity partnerships in the years to come. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 28 Section 3 Methodology The Sharp Memorial Hospital 2019 C ommunity Health Needs Assessment (S MH 2019 CHNA) draws from and is based on the process and findings of the collaborative Hospital Association of San Diego & Imperial Counties 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment (HASD&IC 2019 CHNA) . Sharp HealthCare (Sharp) served as vice -chair of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Committee and has actively participated in and collaborated on the HASD&IC -led CHNA process since 2012. The 2019 CHNA process of community engagement effectively began upon completion of the 2016 CHNA in Fall 2016. H owever, the formal HASD&IC 2019 CHNA contract and process began in late Spring 2017 and concluded in June 2019. Complete details of the methodology and findings of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA are available at: https://h asdic.org/2019 S in cluded additional analyses of SM H/SMBHWN discharge data specific to identified health conditions (aging concerns, behavioral health, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) , diabetes , unintentional injury, maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy , and obesity ), as well as patient, staff and community member engagement activities in order to further explore the specific health and social determinants of health (SDOH) needs of the community s erved by SMH. As such, this sectio n will include details of the SM H 2019 CHNA methods, and, where applicable, elements of the collaborative HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process. Based on the findings of the 2016 CHNA and recommenda tions from the community, the SM H and HASD&IC 2019 CHNA processes sought to provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in San Diego County (SDC) and to inform and guide local hospital s in the development of their programs and strategies that address identified communi ty health needs . These processes also respond to IRS regulatory requirements that tax -exempt hospitals conduct a health needs assessment in the community once every three years. With these goals in mind, the 2019 CHNAs were specifically designed to: build on and strengthen community partnerships established through the 2016 CHNA processes; obtain deeper feedback from and about specific vulnerable populations in San Diego; and align with national best practices around CHNA development and implementation. The 2019 CHNA processes include d analyses of community -identified health conditions as well as SDOH that create health inequities. The latter focus supports the understanding that the burden of illness, premature death, and disability disproportionate ly aff ects minority population groups and other underserved community members . Knowledge of regional and population -specific differences is an important factor in understanding and strategizing ways to effectively impact the health of our community. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 29 HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Committee For the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, the HASD&IC Board of Directors continued with a CHNA Committee to plan and implement the collaborative CHNA process. The CHNA Committee comprises representatives from seven local participating hos pitals and health care systems. Members of the 2019 CHNA Committee are listed below in alphabetical order. In late spring of 2017, HASD&IC contracted with the Institute for Public Health ( IPH) at San Diego State University ( SDSU ) to provide assistance with the collaborative health needs assessment (HASD&IC 2019 CHNA). Please see below for the list of individuals from HASD&IC and IPH that led the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process. Please see Appendix F for detailed descriptions of these partnering organizations.

The aim of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA methodology was to provide a more complete understanding of the identified health needs and associated SDOH in the San Diego community, including barriers connected with tho se identified needs. To gain a deep and meaningful understanding of the health -related needs of SD C residents, two primary methods were employed in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA. First, quantitative analyses were conducted of existing publicly available data to provide an overarching view of critical health issues across SDC . Second, extensive feedback was gathered from community residents, community -based organizations, Fed erally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) , hospitals and health systems, local government agencies, philanthropic organizations , and San Diego County Public Health Services through a comprehensive community engagement process to understand the lived experiences and needs of people in the community. Once these analyses were complete, the CHNA Co mmittee reviewed these data and applied an agreed -upon set of criteria to them to prioritize the top health needs in SDC. Please see the process map in Figure 6 below for an overview of the community engagement activities and quantitative data utilized in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA . For a summary of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement activities, please refer to Figure 7. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 33 Figure 6: HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Process Map Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 34 SMH 2019 CHNA Guided by the same rationale, the SM H 2019 CHNA process also further explored the health ne eds and SDOH identified in the SM H 2016 CHNA. The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process pr ovided the foundation for the SMH 2019 CHNA, with additional SMH/SMBHWN -specific data analysis and community engagement act ivities completing the SM H 2019 CHNA process. Quantitative and qualitative data met hods for both the HASD&IC and SM H 2019 CHNAs are described within this section. 2019 CHNA Quantitative Data Collection and Analysis HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Quantitative data we re used for three primary purposes: (1) to describe the SDC community (see Section 4: Community Defined ); (2) to help plan and design the community engagement process; and (3) to facilitate the \"prioritization process\" \u2014 the identification of the most pressing health needs of SDC residents. The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Committee used several sources of data for the quantitative portion of the CHNA , including the: Public Health Alliance of Southern California 's Healthy Places Index (HPI) Community Needs Index (CNI) California 's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) SpeedTrack California Universal Patient Information Discovery (CUPID ) application Kaiser Permanente (KP) CHNA Data Platform & Analytics (KP CHNA data platform) County of San Diego Community Health Statistics For details on specific sources and dates of the data used, including any data in addition to sources mentioned above, please see the complete HASD&IC 2019 CHNA report at: https://hasdic.org/2019 -chna/ . The Public Health Alliance of Southern California's HPI mapping function and the CNI were used to identify the most under -resourced geographic communities in SDC. This information helped guide the 2019 CHNA community engagement process, including selecting communities from which to solicit input and developing relevant and mean ingful engagement topics and questions. Please refer to the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA ( https://hasdic.org/2019 -chna/ ) for additional details on the HPI tool. Details regarding use of the CNI are included in Section 4: Community Defined as well as Appendix G. SpeedTrack 's CUPID application, was utilized to export emergency department (ED) and inpatient SDC hospital discharge data. These data were analyzed to determine the most common primary diagnosis categories upon discharge. This analysis provided an Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 35 understand ing of the specific health conditions that have the greatest impact on hospit als, which helped inform the CHNA Committee about priority health needs. For those health conditions identified as a high priority for the 2019 CHNA, full datasets were extracted and stratified by age and race. Rates were calculated for each group and for each condition per 100,000 in the population. Overall three -year trends from 2014 -2016 were also calculated for each health condition as well as for each age group and race within each health condition. This stratification shed light on SDC disparities that potentially impact health in SDC . In addition, KP consolidated data about a wide variety of health conditions and SDOH. Data were pulled from datasets such as the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey, and other national and state -wide data sets. These data included the prevalence of certain health conditions and SDOH in SDC, their relative prevalence to state and national rates and benchmarks, the average resulting reduction of life exp ectancy (calculated through empirical literature on disability -adjusted life years), disparities across racial and ethnic groups, and alignment with county rankings of top causes of mortality. KP also conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis to ident ify which SDOH were most predictive of negative health outcomes in SDC census tracts. KP then created a user - friendly, web -based data platform (chna.org/kp) and posted many of their analyses on this platform for use in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA. These analyses guided the design of survey, interview, and focus group questions and were vital to understanding and prioritizing health needs in SDC. For a complete explanation of resources, please see the 2019 CHNA at: analyzed its own hospital data (OSHPD, 2017) specific to each of the identified health needs from the 2016 CHNA: behavioral health, cancer, CVD , Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and senior health (now termed aging concerns). In addition, hospital data for maternal and prenatal health as well as high-risk pregnancy (including SMBHWN data), and unintentional injury were analyzed. Patients included in the analysis were SDC r esidents with an ambulatory visit, ED visit, or inpatient discharge at SMH (or SMBHWN as applicable) in calendar year (CY) 2017. Please refer to Appendix H for the complete data analysis conducted for the SMH 2019 CHN A. Further, SMH cancer registry data were also pulled as part of the quantitative analysis specifically for cancer. In addition, SM H utilized the CNI to identify the most vulnerable and under -resourced communities within its service area. Further, Sharp o verlaid hospital discharge data for CVD , Type 2 diabetes and behavioral health on top of CNI data to analyze the connection between these specific chronic health conditions and under -resourced communities in SDC. This information will further assist in the development of S MH programs to meet community needs in the areas of greatest disparity and inequity. Please refer to Section 4: Community Defined for additional detail on SM H's application of CNI data. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 36 2019 CHNA Qualitative Data Collection and Analysis: Community Engagement Activities HASD&IC 2019 CHNA For the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, i n collaboration with K aiser Foundation Hospital - San Diego and Zion, HASD&IC solicited input from the community through thr ee types of efforts: Focus groups with community residents, community -based organizations, service providers, and health care leaders Key informant interviews with health care experts An online survey distributed to community stakeholders and residents These efforts ensured a rich portrait of community health needs at multiple levels. A key priority of the community engagement process was to solicit input from a wide range of stakeholders so that the sample was as representative of the SDC population as possible. Special efforts were made to include a broad range of community members , including individuals from groups that experience health disparities and service providers who work with those groups . Groups and individuals were invited to participate who had knowledge, information, and expertise relevant to the h ealth needs of the community. Focus groups and key informant (KI) interviews were utilized to identify and explore priority health needs, SDOH, barriers to care, and community assets and reso urces. Focus groups and interviews were conducted in a semi -structured manner. Expert facilitators from the IPH employed questions developed and approved by the CHNA Committee to generate discussion about specific community health needs , as well as open -ended qu estions for broader discussions. Questions varied depending on engagement activity , as well as the expertise and/or specific interests of the person or group participating. T he overarching categories explored in these engagement activities included: inequities and disparities; economic security; immigration; housing environmental factors; and food insecurity. The CHNA Committee worked with community partners to plan community engagement activities with stakeholders representing every region of SDC and all age groups. In addition, the CHNA Committee explicitly sought to engage a wide variety of stakeholders repr esenting numerous racial and ethnic groups. Health leaders and a diverse set of advocacy groups and organizations were also recruited for the process. A total of 579 individuals participated in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, including : 138 community residents and 441 leaders and experts. Please see Table 5 and Figure 7 below for details on the types of participants engaged. A list of individuals who provided input via interview, focus group, or online survey may be found in Appendix I.

The survey was distributed to a broad range of community -based organizations via email. Organizations were also asked to forward the survey on to the community members they serve if they felt it was appropriate . The survey was designed in and distributed via online survey software (Qualtrics). This allowed for the automatic capture of all survey data, which was subsequently imported into Statistical Analysis Software for analysis. Mean rankings for each health c ondition and social determinant were calculated, as were the percentage of respondents who thought each condition had improved, stayed the same, or gotten worse. For a complete description of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA engagement methodologies \u2014 including a l ist of participating individuals and organizations \u2014 as well as a complete description of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA online survey, please refer to the full HASD&IC 2019 CHNA report at : https://hasdic.org/2019 -chna . SMH 2019 CHNA In addition to an active role in the collaborative HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process, S harp contracted separately with the IPH at SDSU to conduct multiple community engagement activities. The overall purpose of the Sharp (including S MH) 2019 CHNA community engagement activities was to gather information about the priority health needs and SDOH impacting Sharp patients in SDC . Specific o bjectives of this community engagement included: Gather in -depth feedback to aid in the understandin g of the most significant health needs and social determinants i mpacting community members served by Sharp Identify opportunities for collaboration on community programs as well as areas of improvement for current community service offerings Align with C HNA best practices across the nation Sharp solicited input from the community through three types of efforts: Focus groups with community residents and Sharp health care providers and leaders KI interviews with Sharp health care providers, including dev elopment of case studies representing a \"typical\" patient experience within Sharp Online survey utilizing the Sharp Insight Community Figure 8 outlines the engagement activities for the Sharp 2019 CHNAs, followed by detailed descriptions of each effort. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 39 Figure 8: Sharp 2019 CHNA - Summary of Community Engagement Activities Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 40 IPH collected input both from Sharp providers and from patients and community members served by Sharp hospitals. Sharp health care provider focus g roup member s and KIs had knowledge, information, and expertise relevant to the health needs of underserved communities and patients served by Sharp. Community residents had either direct experience with Sharp health care services or experie nced these services through the care of a loved one. I nput focused on behavioral health , cancer, diabetes, maternal health and prenatal care, senior health (now termed aging concerns) , and the needs of highly vulnerable patients and community members. Focus groups were utilized to identify and explore priority health needs, SDOH, barriers to care, and community assets and resources. IPH conducted f ocus groups in a semi - structured manner and were facilitated by an expert moderator from the IPH. An addition al IPH staff member took notes during the session and summarized these for later analysis . Each group began with a discussion about the purpose and process of the CHNA. The facilitator then received consent to proceed and reassured participants that their participation was voluntary and their feedback would be anonymous. Questions were developed and approved by the IPH and the HASD&IC CHNA Committee , with input from Sharp team members and leaders. Focus groups were allowed to flow in a conversational manner to ensure that participants had the freedom to discuss issues of importance to them. Questions varied by engagement activity , depending on the expertise or specific interes ts of the group participating. F ood was provided for the participants as an incentive and token of appreciation . A total of 62 people participated in eight focus groups, as detailed in Table 6 below. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 41 Table 6: Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Group Participants Sharp Entity Key : SCHHC = Sharp Coronado Hospital and HealthCare Center; SCVMC = Hospital; SMBHWN =Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns, SMC = Sharp McDonald Center; SMH = Sharp Memorial Hospital; SMVH = Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital ; SRSMG = Sharp Rees -Stealy Medical Group; SCMG = Sharp Community Medical Group; OPP = Sharp Memorial Hospital Outpatient Pavilion; System Services = Sharp HealthCare System Services IPH conducted the KI interviews in an informal, semi -structured manner with Sharp employees who have expertise and prac tice experience in the content area covered by of the case studies. Questions were developed and shared with the interviewees prior to the interviews (see Appendix M ). The interviews flowed in a conversational manner, such that some questions were skipped and others were added in an ad -hoc manner. An IPH staff member with expertise in qualitative research conducted the interviews and took notes. Two interviews were performed, as detailed in Table 7 below.

Recognizing that each patient presents with unique needs, case studies are intended to represent a \"typical\" patient experience within Sharp. Two health conditions are presented in the case studies: high - risk pregnancy and breast cancer. The patients in the stories are not real patients; rather, they were created from a compilation of qualitative data collected as part of the CHNA and the literature review. The full case studies are presented in Appendix J . Two focus groups were relevant to the case studies: (1) the cancer -centered group with 18 cancer navigators and social workers from four Sharp entities on January 3, 2019; and (2) the high -risk condition -centered group with 10 case managers and social workers at SMBHWN on January 10, 2019. Sharp entities participating in the cancer focus grou p included: Sharp Rees -Stealy Medical Group (SRSMG). For the case study related to high -risk pregnancy, Joanna Hunt BSN, RNC -OB, C -EFM, Nurse Educator PSCU/ADC, Perinatal Special Care Unit, SMBHWN was int erviewed on December 19, 2018. For the case study related to cancer, Cara Fairfax, MSW, LCSW, CN-BM, Clinical Social Worker and Patient Navigator, SCVMC Barnhart Cancer Center was interviewed on March 1, 2019. To ensure that the case studies were reflecti ve of current medical knowledge and practice regarding their topics, the IPH researcher consulted a body of literature for each case study. This allowed the case studies to reflect current information and trends regarding risk, symptoms, treatment, managem ent, and morbidities from both health conditions. See Appendix J for a list of sources consulted. For more information on Sharp's focus group and KI interviews (e.g., date and focus), please see Appendix K . For additional details about these community engagement participants (e.g., services provided), please refer to Appendix L . Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 43 Lastly, Sharp conduct ed an online surve y utilizing the Sharp Insight Community, a private online environment for Sharp patients and their families, community members, Sharp employees, and Sharp -affiliated physicians to share insight freely about important information that can help Sharp create a positive health care experience. This survey sought to obtain patient -level feedback on identified health and SDOH needs faced by SDC community members through a broad -reaching online tool. Out of 3,413 survey recipients, a total of 380 participants responded (~ 11%). Participants were asked to choose the top five most important health conditions and top five most important SDOH they felt had the greatest impact on the overall health of their community. Participants were then asked to ra nk their combined choices in order of importance from 1 to 10, with 1 having the greatest impact on overall community health and well -being. In addition, participants were asked to rate their awareness of five selected patient and community outreach progra ms offered by Sharp. Lastly, survey participants were provided the opportunity to provide specific suggestions about what Sharp can do to improve the health and well -being of their community. Please see Appendi x N for a copy of the survey that was distributed, as well as Appendix R for the complete Sharp Insight Community survey results. 2019 CHNA Prioritization Process HASD&IC 2019 CHNA In order to prioritize the top needs, the CHNA Committee analyzed the comprehensive findings from the needs assessment, including quantitative and qualitative data (see Table 8). Table 8: Data Used in HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Prioritization Process Data Used in Prioritization Process Quantitative Data Qualitative Data Analysis of secondary data, health conditions and SDOH County of San Diego leading causes of death 2016 data Hospital discharge trend data retrieved from OSHPD via SpeedTrack Community engagement findings from focus groups Community engagement findings from KI interviews 2019 CHNA survey data The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Committee used the following set of criteria in their prioritization process. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 44 Severity of need: This refers to how severe the health need is (such as its potential to cause death or disability) and its degree of poor performance against the relevant benchmark. Magnitude/scale of the need: The magnitude refers to the number of people affected by the health need. Disparities or inequities: This refers to differences i n health outcomes by subgroups, which may be based on geography, languages, ethnicity, culture, citizenship status, economic status, sexual orientation, age, gender, or other factors . Change over time: This refers to whether or not the need has improved, stayed the same, or worsened. Over the course of several meetings, the CHNA Committee collectively reviewed the quantitative and qualitative data and findings. The CHNA Committee discussed and considered e ach health condition and SDOH for which data was available. Those health conditions and SDOH that met the largest number of criteria were chosen as top priorities. SMH 2019 CHNA As the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process included robust representation f rom the commu nities served by SM H, this prioritization p rocess was replicated for the SM H 2019 CHNA. Findings from the SMH 2019 CHNA prioritization process and analysis of identified health needs and SDOH are summarized in Section 5: Findings . 2019 CHNA Data Limitations and Information Gaps As with any CHNA process, the data available for use are limited. Limitations of the 2019 CHNA processes for both SM H and the collaborative HASD&IC CHNA effort are discussed here to potentially benefit future CHNA processes and reports. In the KP CHNA data platform, for example, some data were only available at a county level, making an accurate translation to neighborhood -level health needs challenging. In the HPI platform, census tracts with very low populations were represented as missing data (to reduce unreliability of measurement). This caused under -sampling of rural areas. In both platforms, disaggregated data around age, ethnicity, race, and gender were not available for many indicators which limited the ability to examine disparities of health within the community. Additionally, data in both platforms were not often Severity of needMagnitude/ scale of the need Disparities or inequitiesChange over timePrioritization Criteria Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 45 collected on a yearly basis and therefore may not represent 2018 values. In order to offset t hese limitations, additional health data were collected and utilized. This data included SDC hospital data, county mortality data, health indicators from the CHIS, clinic data, and other local and national data sources. Please see Appendix O for a list of these additional data sources. Additionally, the age of the data used throughout this CHNA process is worth noting as a limitation. Much of the quantitative data used in both the HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNA processe s were based on several different sources at the state and county level, often over different time periods that were not current to 2019 . For example, the most recent period available for hospital discharge data used in the report was CY 2017 , and more cur rent data ( 2018 ) will not be available until later in 2019 . Relatedly, lack of obesity data at the ZIP code level demonstrates another limitation. This lack of data presents an obstacle for community programs designed to target the issue of obesity within specific communities below the county level. To help reduce the impact of this limit, data and statistics regarding obesity -related illnesses (e.g., diabetes, CVD ) are included in this CHNA. To conduct a comprehensive CHNA, a mixed method approach was re quired, including the collection and analysis of quantitative data and community input from a variety of sources, and the primary data also have their own limitations. The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process included nearly 580 participants in its community en gageme nt processes, while the SM H 2019 CHNA process engaged nearly 445 community participants. For the community engagement process es, every effort was made to target those populations who experience the greatest health inequities. Community participation from t hese groups was strong; however, participants included only those community members who were interested and able to engage in the process. The first - person voices of certain groups, therefore, were underrepresented, such as those who suffer from severe phy sical or cognitive impairments and those without access to transportation to the community engagement activities . Another limitation to the 2019 CHNA process was that the population and disease -specific KI interviews may not have captured all of the challe nges faced by the groups represented. Additionally, CHNA surveys were distributed and collected electronically through both the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA survey and the Sharp Insight Community survey . For the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA survey, w ithout access to community members' email addresses, surveys were distributed through those community -based organizations who were willing to share the survey with their clients. As a result, community member response to the survey was low. In addition, while there was representati on from all regions and ethnicities based on the participants who completed both surveys, smaller sample sizes among certain groups may limit its generalizability to subsections of the population. Further, the format of the Sharp Insight Community online s urvey was not conducive to mobile (e.g., cell phone) users, which potentially limited the reach and reduced the response rate of the survey. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 46 Section 4 Community Defined Although SMH and SMBHWN serve the entire county of San Diego, t he primary communities served by the hospitals include the City of San Diego, Chula Vista, the East County area, and the North Inland communities surrounding Rancho Penasquitos . See Table 9 and Figure 9 for a listing and map of where the majority of SMH an d SMBHWN patients reside. For a mapping of community and region boundaries in SDC overall , please refer to Appendix P .

Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 47 Figure 9: Map of SMH's and SMBHWN's Primary Communities Served Map created by Sharp HealthCare Strategic Planning Department, April 2019 . Feedback on community health needs was solicited from both community members and service providers living and working in SDC, in order to assess priority health issues for the comm unity. Demographics In this section, SMH's and SMBHWN's community is defined not only by its demographic makeup but also by particular socioeconomic barriers known to contribute to health care access and health outcomes. Wherever possible, the descriptions that follow will focus on primary communities served by SMH and SMBHWN (e.g. their combined service area, as defined in previous Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 48 pages), however certain secondary data sources are not available at this level of specificity and broader summarie s of SDC are provided in these instances. In the next five years the SMH and SMBHWN combined service area is projected to grow 3.9 %.4 The fastest growing ZIP codes in SMH and SMBHWN's service area are Chula Vista (91911) and National City (91950), as show n in Table 10. Table 10: Fastest Growing ZIP Codes in SMH and SMBHWN's Service Area, 2018 -2023 ZIP Code Community Name Population 2018 -2023 2018 2020 Change 91911 is organized into six regions extending 4,205 square miles from the southern borders of Orange and Riverside Counties to the border between Mexico and the U.S. With a population of more than three million people, San Diego is the second largest county in California. The population is predominately white (46.7%), Hispanic or Latino (33.1%) and Asian/Paci fic Islander (11.8%).5 According to the California Department of Social Services, more than 13,000 refugees have been admitted to SDC since 2010. From October 2012 to September 2017, SDC had the largest number of admissions among all counties in California .6 Of these, the majori ty arrived from Iraq (77 .0%), and most have settled in the county's central and east regions.7 In 2018, there were 302,434 residents ages 65 and older in the SMH and SMBHWN combined service area, representing 14.0% of the populatio n. Between 2018 and 2023, it is anticipated that the senior population in the SMH and SMBHWN servic e area will grow by 23.0% .4 In 2016, the majority of households in SDC reported that the primary language spoken at hom e was English only (62.5%), while 22. 6% identified as bilingual and 9.7 % cited their primary language spoken at home as Spanish only. As of 2016, 13.6 % of SDC's population age s 25 and older had no high school diploma (or equivalency) .5 Please see Table 1 1 for more SDC demographic data. 4 Speedtrack, Inc., 2019. 5 County of San Diego HHSA, Public Health Service, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018.

It is important to note here that in SDC, cancer (malignant neoplasms) is the leading cause of death. This underscores the importance of SMH's commitment to programs that help to educate, screen and prevent the incidence of cancer, as well as to programs that offer support and resources for community mem bers impacted by cancer. Identifying SMH's High -Need Areas A critical component of understanding community health is to identify geographic areas of inequities. SMH utilized a specific metric to determine which portions of its service area are likely experience th e greatest health disparities: the Dignity Health CNI . The CNI generates a score for each ZIP code based on data about barriers to socioeconomic security. The five barriers used to determine CNI scores are: 1. Income Barriers 2. Cultural Barriers 3. Educational Barriers 4. Insurance Barriers 5. Housing Barriers 15 County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 53 The CNI provides a score for every populated ZIP code in the United States (U.S.) on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0. A score of 1.0 indicates a ZIP code with the least need (light blue in Figures 10 -12 below), while a score of 5.0 represents a ZIP code with the most need (dark green in Figures 10 -12 below ). For a detailed description of the CNI please see Appendix G or visit the interactive website at: http://cni.chw -interactive.org/ . Table 19 below presents primary communities (by ZIP code) served by S MH that have especially high need based on their CNI score (4-5). Table 19: High -Need Primary Communities Served by SMH and SMBHWN Cajon 92102 Diego 92105 City Heights Linda Vista 92113 Southeast San Encanto 92115 College Area 92154 Otay Mesa Source: Dignity Health Community Need Index, 2018. In addition, Figures 10-12 below present CNI maps for SDC \u2014 including many communities served by SMH and SMBHWN \u2014 with Sharp hospital discharge data for behavioral health, cardiovascular health, and diabetes overlaid on the map. These maps demonstrate that while these chronic diseases affect communities of varying need, those areas with the highest CNI score (and thus highest v ulnerability) often present higher discharge rates for these chronic health conditions. Thus, the maps strongly suggest the connection between rates of chronic disease, health care utilization, SDOH /socioeconomic factors and thus, health equity . These maps are also available in Appendix Q .

Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 57 Section 5 Findings This section d escribes findings of the SM H 2019 CHNA process. When applicable, findings from the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA are also described, as the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process included strong representati on of the community served by SMH and SMBHWN , and a significant proportion of its findings reflect the same health needs o f community members served by these hospitals . 2019 CHNA Findings: Top Community Health Need s HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Through the prioritization process described above in Section 3: Methodology , the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Committee identified the following health conditions and SDOH as the most critical health needs within SDC (listed below in alphabetical order): 1. Access to Health Care 2. Aging Concerns 3. Behavioral Health 4. Cancer 5. Chronic Conditions 6. Community and Social Support 7. Economic Security 8. Education 9. Homelessness and Housing Instab ility 10. Unintentional Injury and Violence Figure 13 below describes the interactive nature of S DOH and health conditions \u2014 each impacting the other. In addition, an underlying theme of stigma and the barriers it creates arose across both the HASD&IC and SM H 2019 CHNA community engagement efforts. For instance, stigma impacts the way in which people access needed services that address SDOH, which consequentially impacts their ability to maintain and manage health conditions. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 58 Figure 13: HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Top 10 Community Heath Needs for San Diego County SMH 2019 CHNA Through the prioritization processes described in Section 3: Methodology , the SMH 2019 CHNA identified the same health conditions and SDOH as the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA. In addition, SMH identified Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy as a priority health need for its community members. The priority needs identified fo r the communities served by SMH are listed below in alphabetical order: 1. Access to Health Care 2. Aging Concerns 3. Behavioral Health 4. Cancer 5. Chronic Health Conditions ( CVD , diabetes, obesity) 6. Community and Social Support 7. Economic Security 8. Education 9. Homelessness and Housing Instability 10.

Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 60 Figure 14: Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community Survey Final Ranked Health Conditions and SDOH Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 61 Access to Health Care Definition Access to care refers to the ease with which an individual can obtain needed medical services.16 Findings Access to health care includes two components : the specific services that individuals are unable to obtain, and the barriers and SDOH that prevent individuals from obtaining those services. 1. Types of care that are difficult to access: Behavioral health care Dental care Primary care Specialty care 2. Barriers to accessing care and associated SDOH: Culturally competent care Economic security Fear related to immigration status Lack of health insurance and insurance issues Shortage of health care providers Transportation Access to health care emerged as a high pri ority health need in both the SM H and HASD&IC 2019 CHNA secondary data analyses and community engagement activities. Secondary Data Findings Data are available regarding three components of health care access in SDC: (1) health insurance covera ge; (2) preventable hospital events; and (3) receipt of regular care from a primary care physician (PCP). Health Insurance Coverage A lack of health insurance coverage represents a major barrier to health care services. In SDC, 11% of people are uninsur ed. Certain groups, including those who identify as \"other,\" Native American/Alaska Native, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and Black, have higher rates of being uninsured than others. See Figure s 15, 16 and 17 below for additional details. 16 RAND Corporation. https://www.rand.org/topics/health -care-access.html Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 62 Figure 15: Percen tage of Population without Health Insurance in SDC, CA, and the United States.

Ages 19 -64 Years by Ethnicity, 2017 Preventable Hospital Events Another measure of access to care is how often \"preventable hospital events\" occur. This number is the patient discharge rate for health conditions that are \"ambulatory care sensitive\" \u2014 conditions that could have potentially been prevented or managed with proper preventive care, such as pneumonia, dehydration, asthma and diabetes. In SDC , the rate of preventable hospital events is 29.7 per 1,000 residents. For Black individuals, however, this rate is higher \u2014 45.1 per 1,000 residents suggesting that Black individuals may have more difficulty accessing primary care resources3 (see Figure 18).

While many San Diegans (71.8%) have seen a PCP in the past year, Medicare beneficiaries, a group made up primarily o f people ages 65 and older, are less likely to receive regular care from a PCP. Of this group, only 67.4% have seen a PCP in the last year (2015). This is lower than the California state average of 72.9% ( see Figure 19).

Please see Appendix O for Access to Health Care secondary source inf ormation. Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Across all types of HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement activities, access to health care was identified by participants as a priority health need in SDC. Respondents to the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA online survey ranked access to care as the health need having the greatest impact on the overall health and well -being of SDC residents out of all listed health conditions and SDOH. See Appendix S for a full summary of survey results. During the HASDIC 2019 CHNA focus groups and KI interviews, participants often cited accessing care as the most challenging issue facing their communities. Frequently discussed topics related to access to care included: 68.2%72.9% San Diego County California Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 65 Barriers to care The types of care most challenging to access People for whom access to care is particularly problematic Please see Table 20 or Appendix T for a summary of these fi ndings. Further detail is included in the Discussion of Community Engagem ent Findings below. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups Access to care was identified as having a significant impact on health outcomes and well-being consistently across all of the Sharp/S MH 2019 CHNA focus groups, including: Sharp Diabetes Health Educators , Sharp Case Management Leadership, Sharp Cancer Patient Navigators and Social Workers , Sharp Senior Health Center staff and patients/community members and Sharp Patient Family Adv isory Council (PFAC) members. Details specific to the Sharp Case Management Leadership and Sharp PFAC focus groups are included in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings below. Tables 21 and 22 present summaries of findings from these two focus groups. Please refer to Appendix U for a summary of all SM H/Sharp focus groups. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community Sharp's Insight Community online survey provided greater understanding of access to health care as an identified health need among Sharp patients and community members. Among 14 SDOH, respondents (n=380) ranked access to health care (primary care, dental care, behavioral health, s pecialty care) as the second most important SDOH impacting their community. Please refer to Appendix R for Sharp Insight Community participant rankings of SDOH. When health conditions and SDOH were combined amo ng all respondents, access to health care once again ranked as the second most important health need among a total of 30 choices. Please refer back to Figure 14 for the final ranking of health conditions and SDOH by Sharp Insig ht Community survey participants. Discussion of Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Focus Groups and KI Interviews HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants identified five primary barriers to accessing health care in San Diego: (1) lack of insurance; (2) economic insecurity; (3) transportation; (4) fear related to immigration status; and (5) lack of culturally competent/ling uistically appropriate care options. Lack of insurance was named as an important barrier to care for San Diego residents. The lack of insurance, participants explained, arises from the inability to pay for insurance due to competing financial priorities (particularly housing), the limited Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 66 availability of insurance for undocumented residents, and from fears that applying for public insurance, such as Medi -Cal, for their children, will lead to deportation or interfere with a path to citizenship. Economic insecurity was discussed not only as an underlying reason for not obtaining health insurance but also as a reason for not attempting to receive needed care for acute issues and, particularly, preventive care for health management. Health insurance premiums, co -pays, co -insurance, and out of pock et payments were described as financially prohibitive for many residents. In addition, participants indicated that taking time off work, and losing those paid hours as a result, is not a realistic option for most low-income people. Transportation was als o discussed as a significant obstacle to health care access. Community engagement participants noted that for those without cars, public transportation to health care appointments ca n be time -consuming, expensive and inconvenient, and some hospitals and cl inics are not easily reached by public transportation. Transportation was noted to cause particular challenges for seniors, those in rural areas, and those who are homeless. Fears related to immigration status came up as an important and pressing topic d uring nearly all of the community engagement activities. Participants described undocumented immigrants as living in a \"constant state of fear\" of detention and deportation. This fear, in turn, they said, prevents them from receiving health care, even in acute situations. During focus groups, many stories were told about Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids that resulted in the long -term detention and sometimes deportation of San Diego residents who have lived and worked in the community for decades. P arents talked about being terrified of being separated from their children. Community members also made clear that even immigrants who are in the country legally are worried that the receipt of public benefits or community services will create obstacles in their path to citizenship. Finally, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants noted that the inability to obtain culturally competent/linguistically appropriate care keeps residents from receiving health care. They noted that most individuals prefer to receive health care from people who are from or who understand their cultural background, and that cultural mismatches between health care providers and patients can create mistrust. They also noted that translators are often not available, which makes health care visits frustrating for both the patient and the provider. At times, the participants discussed, children must be utilized as translators, which can create both an undue burden for the children and an uncomfortable situation for the paren ts when they would rather keep their health information private. Several other barriers were mentioned but with less frequency: Lack of knowledge in the community about available resources and about where to receive specific types of health care Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 67 How t o navigate the health care system, particularly in regards to accessing specialists after a diagnosis Too few hospitals and clinics in SDC Workforce shortages in certain areas of health care (e.g., mental health) HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement pa rticipants emphasized that while all types of health care can be difficult to access, obtaining timely, quality behavioral health services is particularly challenging. Both mental health care and substance abuse treatment were discussed. Several issues r elated to mental health care arose during the community engagement activities. For those who are insured, finding a mental health care provider who is available after work or school hours, located reasonably close to home or work, has openings in a short t ime-frame, and takes their insurance is a time -consuming and frustrating process. For those without insurance, participants felt that it is nearly impossible to find a mental health care provider. A shortage of urgent care mental health options was also di scussed. Participants also noted that there are too few inpatient psychiatric beds and that, often, those who have been hospitalized cannot secure appropriate and effective transitional mental health services. Participants also emphasized a dire shortage of substance use disorder treatment options. For those with addictions, inpatient programs have long waiting lists, and there are too few urgent care options. Other types of care that HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants mentioned less frequently included: Oral health/dental care Specialty appointments after a diagnosis is made Primary care Urgent care HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants stressed that for certain people, access to care is especially difficult, and that these challenges contribute to and worsen health disparities. Groups cited as particularly vulnerable included: Seniors Homeless individu als Sexual minorities (LGBTQ individuals) Immigrants Low-income individuals Racial/ethnic minorities Participants explained that all of these groups may be more vulnerable to poor health, so the people who need consistent, quality health care the most may not receive it. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 68 Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups In the Sharp PFAC focus group, participants identified b arriers to accessing care as financial issues, challenges navigating the health care system and insurance issues, lack of health literacy, fears regar ding immigration issues, and cultural/language issues. Limited finances were portrayed as a primary barrier to care. Contributors emphasized that t he cost of health insuran ce, co -pays and transportation prevents people from getting necessary health care. P eople in the community, they explained, are often faced with competing priorities for limited finances, and when the choice is between food or medicine, they choose food. Sharp PFAC focus group participants highlighted that difficulties with navigation o f both the health care system itself and the insurance system also create obstacles to care. One example shared by a focus group member is that some people do not understand that the lower their insurance premium is, the higher their deductible will be. An other contributor talked about how enrolling in public health insurance programs is complicated, and the materials can be difficult to read. Yet another contributor talked about how some people don't understand when they should go to a primary care appoint ment versus urgent care versus the emergency room. Lack of health literacy about preventive care, illness and disease was also described as a barrier to care. Sharp PFAC focus group participants explained that all of these issues are exacerbated by langu age and cultural barriers. New immigrants may be unfamiliar with the U.S. health care system and unaware of available resources. Many are afraid that if they utilize services, their immigration status may be questioned and they may be deported. Sharp PFAC focus group contributors also reported that more translation services are needed, and that cultural mismatches between health care provider and patient can cause mistrust. Sharp PFAC focus group participants also talked about specific challenges for pa tients who have been discharged from the hospital. Inadequate support at home for people living alone was noted to be a concern, including having enough food, especially among seniors. Transportation to follow -up appointments was also presented as a challe nge, particularly for people with limited mobility. Finally, Sharp PFAC focus group contributors highlighted the impact these types of challenges can have. They explained that trying to understand and utilize the health care system and insurance can be p hysically and mentally exhausting. They also asserted that, for some, depression may develop from the frustration of trying to figure out who will pay for their health care and how they will get there. Please refer to Table 21 or Appendix U for a summary of feedback from the Sharp PFAC focus group. Access to care was discussed extensively during the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group, and contributors cited many factors that serve as obstacles to good care for high -risk populations, including economic and food insecurity, housing, Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 69 challenges with insurance for patients and for hospitals, fears related to immigration status , waiting lists for appointments, and issues specific to discharge care. Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants discussed economic insecurity as a barrier to both care access and effective management of chronic conditions. For example, many people cannot afford to take time off work for medical appointments, so they attempt to manage their care around their work schedule. Some medications were identified as being particularly expensive. Related to this, many patients experience food inse curity. One participant shared that patients on a limited income have a hard time choosing between paying their copays and for their medications and eating. This, the participant emphasized, occurs even with those who are insured. Housing costs and conce rns also keep people from getting care, Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group members said. \"Their main concern,\" one participant noted, \"is having a home to live in rather than managing their own care....so there is a tendency to delay receiving heal th care until an emergency situation arises.\" Insurance issues were also described as problematic, both for patients and for hospitals. It is difficult for patients to understand what their insurance will cover. Sharp Case Management Leadership focus gro up members reported that for hospitals, certain case managers spend a lot of time going back and forth with insurance companies \u2014 particularly about completed discharges \u2014 and the hospital often ends up taking the loss. In addition, many skilled nursing fa cilities and home health programs do not accept Medi -Cal, making them inaccessible to many people. Fears related to immigration issues were also brought up as a concern for accessing care. Although eligibility for public insurance has broadened, many peop le will not sign up, they said, due to fear of being put on a \"black list\" for utilizing public services. For undocumented women, Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants explained, follow -up care is extremely difficult because while the m other wants to ensure the well -being of her baby, she is also fearful of immigration officials finding her at medical appointments. Waiting lists to receive care also create obstacles, Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants emphasized. It can take a long time to see a PCP, and specialists have even longer waiting lists. Finally, focus group participants discussed issues related to discharge. Transportation support, Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants said, particul arly for those with debilitating conditions, is difficult to access. Recuperative care, they outlined, is also scarce. And for patients who are elderly, it is challenging to find and afford short -term caregivers after hospital discharge. Please refer to Table 22 or Appendix U for a summary of feedback from the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group. Access to care was mentioned frequently throughout the Sharp Diabetes Health Educator , SMBHWN Social Workers & Case Managers , Sharp Cancer Navigators and Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 70 Social Worker , and Sharp Senior Health Center focus groups as well. Please see the findings for Aging Concerns , Diabetes , Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High - Risk Pregnancy and Cancer for specific feedback on access to care and its connection to these identified health needs. Sharp 2019 CHNA Suggestions Sharp PFAC focus group participants proposed several suggestions to improve community health, all of which address the identified need of access to care: Prioritize the hiring and training of social workers. Social workers can coordinate care, create discharge plans, and make follow -up appointments. Patients are in need of a supportive advocate at the time of discharge. Offer free post -surgery home visits. Make follow -up phone calls to see if patients who have been discharged a re doing well and getting proper follow -up care. Make in -home care more accessible, particularly for older patients. Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants also offered suggestions to improve the health outcomes of their patients. The se suggestions all seek to address the challenge of access to care: Ensure 2 -1-1 Community Information Exchange (CIE)17 access for all Sharp facilities. Establish more patient -centered initiatives. House a program onsite at hospitals that helps place people in housing, gets them referrals/helps with applications to affordable housing. Create more home support services and adult day centers to help patients transition back to the community or home af ter hospital discharge. Establish a more streamlined process and a communication system between the hospitals and the County about those who qualify for wraparound services, such as Whole Person Wellness. Sharp Insight Community survey participants also had the opportunity to provide specific suggestions about what Sharp can do to improve the health and well -being of the community. See Appendix R for the most commonly suggested themes , among which 'Improving ac cess to health care' was second most common. Feedback related to access to care included: Lower insurance premiums and co -pays ; make lower cost health insurance available to Per Diem employees ; lower prices and provide a \"menu\" of services with prices for people with or without insurance . 17 2-1-1 San Diego's Community Information Exchange (CIE) is an ecosystem comprised of multidisciplinary network partners that use a shared language, a resource database, and an integrat ed technology platform to deliver enhanced community care planning. Care planning tools enable partners to integrate data from multiple sources and make bi -directional referrals to create a shared longitudinal record. Source : https://ciesandiego.org/what -is-cie/ Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 71 Heighten access for low income or limited insurance community members; offer clinics or outreach health care for those without insurance or money to pay; help more people secure insurance to fund programs. Advocate for more community -based programs from politicians. Offer later appointments or early mornings for working people; shorten wait times for appointments; sometimes obtaining an appointment takes a long time \u2014 have more resources so that appointments can be made sooner. Provide bus schedules that show routes direc tly to Sharp facilities. Mobile Units \u2014 if it is possible to go out to the public, it could help address some of the transportation concerns and even help with s ome of the stigma concerns by coming to the patient and making it convenient to be seen . Create an \"app\" (for cell phone, etc.) for access to medical records and doctor appointments . Additional recommendations from the Sharp Insight Community survey can be found in Appendix R. Please refer to Tables 21 and 22 for a summary of responses from the Sharp PFAC and Sharp Case Management Leadership focus groups.

Blackout dates for electronic benefit transfer (EBT) funds due to federal funding. Education needed on: o Dementia or Alzheimer's o How to be a caregiver o Therapy options & available support groups o How to navigate the immigration system Fear : patients delay surgery due to fear. Immunization and Vaccinations: families are fearful of autism. o People are uncertain of where to get flu shots and how to pay for them. Misinformation on side effects. Insurance issues : insurance is expensive especially copays for families. Transportation issues cause delays seeing doctors, especially those living in rural areas. Seniors Food access and food insecurity which can lead to readmissions. Economic security : due to fixed income Transportation lack of access to transportation and decreased capacity to drive.

Community and Family Support : school pressure causes children to be stressed. o Pressured by parents to do extracurricular activities, volunteer work, and sports all in an effort to apply for Ivy League schools. o Peer pressure Immunization against measles and polio. Sex trafficking especially in the Parkway Plaza area which affects individuals of all socioeconomic statuses. Technology : electronics and social media leads to sleep deprivati on, attention problems, and poor sleep quality. YOUTH ROLES IN FAMILY CARE Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 74 Help with family routines such as helping with taking care of siblings, driving, cooking. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS Economic security o High cost of medication is of special concern for seniors impacting their access to health care o Food insecurity. Education : lack of health education and health literacy. Patients do not understand when to use urgent care versus the ED. Problems navigati ng health insurance such as understanding health plans. DAILY LIVES How do these health and social conditions affect community member's daily lives? People can develop depression when trying to figure out how they will pay for their health care or how to secure transportation to appointments. People experience mental and physical exhaustion from trying to understand the health care system and insurance. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS Transportation is a challenge. Medication reconciliation of old versus new medications. Language issues or language barriers. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE SOLUTIONS Follow -up care and phone calls o Improving social workers role in ensuring follow up care and continuity of care post discharge. o Follow up phone calls post discharge especially if patients have rehabilitation scheduled. In-home care and visits o Providing free home visits for post -surgery follow -up. o Access to affordable in-home care options is needed. Patients need a supportive advocate at the time of discharge. IMMIGRATION Have you observed any changes in the community's health and wellbeing as a result of immigration policies, attitudes and beliefs? Some community members believe that new diseases will arrive in the US due to the lack of health care received from immigrants prior to entering the U.S. Accessing care for undocumented population: There is fear of looking for help or accessing care for the undocumented. Often times they have more health issues than the gene ral population Accessing care for the Middle Eastern (refugee) population: Cultural : Sometimes there is cultural preference or bias in the language especially with women because men often make choices for the women, so translation can sometimes be inaccur ate o They are not accustomed to accessing health care or are unfamiliar with how to access health care in the U.S. Education : health literacy, knowledge of how to navigate healthcare system. New immigrants are unaware of services available. Fear : some are afraid of police or authority in general. Language barriers : there are issues surrounding translations services over the phone versus using someone such as a family member. Some hospital policies are to not use family members due to confidentiality and tr anslation issues. o If there is a workshop or a service refugees are interested in, it is generally not in their language o Translations : for Sharp Grossmont Hospital specifically, many Middle Eastern immigrants need documents translated in their native langua ges (Farsi, for example) Trauma: Many come from war zones; have mental trauma, PTSD, and/or depression.

Economic security o Food insecurity o Lack of childcare due to cost and inability to take time off work to care for newborn . Housing: lack of affordable housing . Insurance issues and underfunding . o Skilled nursing facilities and home health do not accept Medi -Cal. Health literacy : not knowing where to get care . Lack of transportation ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS Long wait times to access care leads to readmissions, often times there is a six month minimum to see a specialist . Many access issues are insurance driven which creates a backup in hospitals . Many individuals are unaware that they have a primary care provider which can cause delays in home health referrals . HOSPITAL COMMUNICATION Do you or your staff interact with community clinics, social services organizations, or other community resources in any way to support patients/their families? Some case managers use 2 -1-1 San Diego as a means to connect patients to needed social servic es by sending a referral electronically using their electronic health record system . HOSPIT AL AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT NEEDED 2-1-1 Community Info Exchange Access is needed for all Sharp facilities to inform next steps for patient discharge (Sharp Grossmont and Sharp Chula Vista currently do not have access, as of 2/21/19 ). Housing is the number one need for many patients . o Patient -centered initiatives : there is a n eed for more patient -centered initiatives, especially with housing. o Dedicated housing coordinator : there is a need for an on -site coordinator (non -Sharp staff) whose sole job is to place people in housing or get them referrals/applications to affordable housing. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS Transportation support is needed, especially for very debilitating health conditions . Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 76 o Need a dedicated person on -site to help patients fill out the metropolitan transit system applications for those who qualify for discounted bus passes due to having a disability . Recuperative care o San Diego Rescue Mission's closure means less respite care capacity . o The lack of recuperative care forces case man agers to discharge patients to Board and C are facilities or Independent Living F acilities , which is very expensive for patients. Short term caregivers : need for additional short term caregivers to help transport patients and check in on patients . Home support services: need additional in -home support services for hospitals or adult day centers to help patients transition back to the community or home . Wraparound service support : there is a need to streamline the process from the hospital to the County for those who qual ify for wraparound services . IMMIGRATION Have you observed any changes over the past year in patient/community member attitude towards immigration issues? Fear o There has been an increase of patients who are eligible for insurance, but will not sign up due to fear of public charge . o Patients are fearful of being put on a blacklist if they use public funded services . o Immigrants fear that if they use Medi -Cal their property will be taken away . Aging Concerns Definition Aging concerns are defined as those conditions that predominantly affect seniors \u2014 people who are 65 and older \u2014 such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, falls and limited mobility. Findings Conditions that disproportionately affect older adults were identified as a high priority health need through both the SMH and HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement activities and secondary data analyses. Community engagement participants most often descr ibed aging concerns in relation to the SDOH that affect seniors such as: Transportation Access to fresh food Social isolation and inadequate family support Economic insecurity Secondary Data Findings According to SDC data, hospital discharges have increased from 2014 -2016 for both Alzheimer's disease and dementia (see Figure 20). For Alzheimer's disease, the ED visit rate increased by 35.1%, and the inpatient discharge rate increased by 16.3%. For Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 77 dementia, the ED visit rate increased by 10.6%, while the inpatient discharge rate increased by 7.1%. Figure 20: ED visit and Inpatient Discharge Rates for Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia in SDC, 2014 -2016 In addition, Alzheimer's disease was the third leading cause of death and Pa rkinson's disease was the 12th leading cause of death in SDC in 2016. SDC data shows that falls disproportionally affect those over 65 years of age. From 2014 to 2016 , ED visits for seniors increased by 2.5%, however , the mortality rate for falls decreased by 14.5% in the same time period.

Falls In 2017, seniors represented 54.1% of inpatient discharges for unintentional injury at SMH , with fall -related injuries occurring in 85.3% percent of those discharges . CVD In 2017, seniors represented 49.9% of ED visits where a CVD diagnosis was present . In 2017, the top three inpatient CVD diagnoses among seniors at SMH were classified as hypertension, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), and heart failure. Diabetes In 2017, individuals identified as Other Race comprised 19.5% of all senior inpatient discharges, and 20.3% of all senior ED visits, at SMH, yet comprised 26.5% of senior inpatient discharges, and 27.6% of all senior ED visits , with a Type 2 diabetes diagn osis, respectively . In 2017, the top three inpatient and ED Type 2 diabetes diagnoses among seniors at SMH were Type 2 diabetes with Chronic Kidney Disease , Type 2 diabetes (uncomplicated), and Type 2 diabetes with hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). Obesi ty In 2017, seniors represented 39.0% of inpatient discharges at SMH with a diagnosis related to obesity. Arthritis In 2017, seniors represented 62.8% of inpatient discharges with a diagnosis related to arthritis. Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Respondents to the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA online survey identified Alzheimer's disease as one of the top 10 most impactful behavioral health conditions in SDC. See Appendix S for a full summary of surve y results. During the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus groups and KI interviews, conversations about aging concerns centered around conditions that disproportionately affect older adults and barriers to care for older adults. Please see Table 23 or Appendix T for a summary Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 80 of these findings. Further details are covered in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings section below. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups For S MH's 2019 CHNA, two focus groups were conducted with Sharp Senior Health Center staff and patients and community members to better understand the identified health need of aging concerns among Sharp's senior patients and community members. Table 24 summarizes the findings of these focus groups. Further details are covered in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings section below. For a description of focus group participants, see Section 3: Methodology . In addition, participants in focus groups conducted with the Sharp PFAC and Sharp Case Management Leadership , also highlighted aging concerns and challenges specific to seniors. However, this section will focus specifically on the focus groups held with Sharp Senior Health Center staff and patients and community members. For a summary of feedback from the Sharp PFAC and Sharp Case Management Leadership focus groups, please refer to Appendi x U. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community Sharp's Insight Community online survey provided greater understanding of the identified health need of aging concerns for Sharp patients and community members. Overall, Sharp Insight Community respondents (n= 380) ranked aging concerns as the most important health condition impacting their community. Not surprisingly, respondents ages 65 or older (n=163) also ranked aging concerns number one in health conditions impacting their community. Following aging concer ns, survey respondents ages 65 or older noted cancer, behavioral/mental health, obesity and heart disease as the next four most important health issues. See Appendix R for the ranked health conditions specificall y among participants ages 65 or older. Feedback regarding the most pressing SDOH was also observed specifically among Sharp Insight Community survey respondents ages 65 or older. Respondents in this age group ranked health insurance, access to care, healt h behaviors, economic security and homelessness as the top SDOH impacting their community. See Appendix R for details. When health conditions and SDOH were combined among respondents in all age groups, aging concerns ranked as the third most important health need among a total of 30 choices. Please refer back to Figure 14 for the final ranking of health conditions and SDOH by Sharp Insight Community survey participants. After ranking various health conditions and SDOH , Sharp Insight Community survey participants were asked to rate their awareness of five community out reach programs offered by S harp. Notably, 55% of respondents ages 65 or older were not at all familiar Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 81 with the Sharp Senior Resource Centers, while 58% were not at all familiar with Sharp's transportation services \u2014 two programs that especially benefit seniors. Similarly, among all age groups, 59% were not at all familiar with the Sharp Senior Resource Centers, while 59% were not at all familiar with Sharp's transportation services \u2014 two programs that could lessen the burden on family members and caregivers of seniors. In addition, 63% of senior survey respondents were not at all aware of Sharp's behavioral health support groups, while 45% were unaware of Sharp's cancer support groups \u2014 programs that support two priority health conditions specifically identified by senior respondents . Additional feedback particularly from participants ages 65 or older is presented in Appendix R. Discussion of Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups HASD&IC 2019 CHNA f ocus group participants discussed several health conditions and SDOH that particularly affect older adults. These included Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, dementia, arthritis, loss of mobility, opioid abuse, diabetes, heart disease, anxiety, depressi on, lung disease, obesity, and poor oral health. They also detailed SDOH that affect seniors, including lack of accessible or reliable transportation options, challenges accessing fresh food, social isolation and inadequate family support, economic insecur ity, and environmental pollutants. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group participants also emphasized that health maintenance is more difficult for seniors. Medication management, including ordering refills, picking up prescriptions, and taking the right dose o f medications at the right time, can be challenging for older adults who do not have adequate support. In addition, the health conditions associated with aging may interfere with an individual's ability to exercise and to access healthy, fresh food. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group contributors also explained that accessing health care for seniors can be particularly difficult. For instance w hen seniors can no longer drive, finding reliable, affordable transportation can be challenging. In addition, seniors living off of social security, or other limited income, are concerned about their economic security. T he high cost of medications, co-pays and deductibles may prohibit them from accessing health care. Physical limitations \u2014 such as limited mobility, hearing problems and vision issues \u2014 may also create difficulties for seniors. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group contributors highlighted that, for those seniors who do not speak English as a first language, language issues also po se a barrier to care. Please see the Community and Social Support section for more details on language issues. Lastly, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group participants noted that after discharge from a hospital, seniors may have inadequate support at home to recover well and follow -up care is difficult for them to locate and secure. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 82 Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups Focus groups held with Sharp Senior Health Center staff and senior patients and community members identif ied several health conditions that are especially impactful for seniors. These include opioid abuse, diabetes, heart failure and disease, dementia, depression, lung disease, obesity, and physical aging concerns including loss of mobility and falls. Social conditions that affect seniors were identified as lack of good transportation options, lack of access to fresh food, social isolation and inadequate family support, economic insecurity, housing issues and environmental pollutants (including sound). For sen iors, the participants said, these issues lead to a loss of independence, which can contribute to increased stress, isolation, loneliness and poor mental health. Sharp Senior Health Center staff and senior patients and community members explained that ac cess to health care is especially challenging for several reasons. Since senior patients are often admitted to a hospital in order to receive the treatment they need, health care access becomes even more critical. Regarding transportation , focus group mem bers noted that many seniors can no longer drive themselves and may not have friends or family to drive them. Using public transportation is an intimidating and financially prohibitive prospect for some seniors. Some participants described the difficulty i n using public transportation when one is in a wheel chair or uses a cane or walker, and some health care facilities are not easily accessed by public transportation. Further, the cost of transportation can be a barrier. Participants in both focus groups described isolation and loneliness due to lack of community and family support as barriers to care. This isolation is due to loss of independence and mobility which is exacerbated by the lack of transportation options for seniors. In addition, families ar e often unable to help their aging parents due to their own financial situations or due to the busy lives they lead with family and work. Economic security also creates obstacles to care, focus group members said. Seniors generally live on fixed incomes a nd worry about how to balance high housing costs with high medical costs, especially for medications, as well as with purchasing food. Physical limitations such as limited mobility, hearing problems and vision issues create substantial obstacles to care f or seniors. Participants noted that even calling to schedule medical appointments is inordinately difficult for those who are hard of hearing. For those who do not speak English as a first language, language issues are also a barrier to care. After discharge from a hospital, additional barriers exist, the focus group participants said. Follow -up care is difficult for seniors to secure, as is the necessary medical equipment. This can be attributed to the previously described transportation, economic Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 83 security and social isolation barriers, as well as a lack of awareness of resources in the community that might be helpful. Sometimes, they said, seniors are hesitant to seek help. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community The Sharp Insight Community survey reinforced the importance of addressing senior health issues, as aging concerns were ranked as the number one health condition affecting community members. In addition, the majority of respondents were not at all familiar with the Sharp Senior Reso urce Centers . This indicates a missed opportunity for seniors as well as their families and caregivers to receive resources and support for various senior needs such as exercise programs, education al classes, transportation and meal services, and governmen t assistance. Further, although senior respondents ranked cancer and behavioral health as the second and third most important health conditions impacting their community, the majority were not at all familiar with the support groups offered by Sharp to add ress these issues. Sharp Insight Community survey participants expressed similar concerns to focus group participants. Survey respondents ages 65 and older identified access to care and economic security as being among the most important issues for the co mmunity, in addition to issues related to health insurance (understanding, securing and using), health behaviors (diet, physical activity, etc.), and homelessness (overcrowding, substandard conditions , housing affordability). Further, survey participants o f all ages expressed a general lack of awareness of Sharp's community outreach programs, including the Sharp Senior Resource Centers and Sharp's transportation services, which offer resources and support that can address many of the barriers to care expres sed above. Sharp 2019 CHNA Suggestions During the focus groups, Sharp Senior Health Center staff and senior patients and community members p rovided several suggestions to increase health care access for seniors, including: Establish a centralized commu nication database so that patient information can be shared across health care systems. Create and promote more programs to assist seniors with rides to medical appointments and to grocery stores. Create and promote more home visitor programs where volunte ers visit seniors at home. Expand meal delivery services. Expand the behavioral health care , including psychiatric services, available to Medi -Cal and Medicare patients. Increase the availability of translators. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 84 In addition, Sharp Insight Community survey participants (43.0% ages 65 and older) had the opportunity to provide specific suggestions about what Sharp can do to improve the health and well -being of the community. See Appendix R for the most commonly suggested themes. Feedback related to aging concerns included: Continue supporting efforts to address food insecurity. Help more people secure health insurance. Provide transportation for citizens who cannot drive or afford other means. Improve advertising of program and service offerings, ensuring the use of multiple media channels; hold a forum on senior resources. Increase investment in post -acute management. Promote accessing community centers for physical and social activity. Additional recommendations from the Sharp Insight Community survey can be found in Appendix R.

SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IMPACTING SENIOR HEALTH Economic insecurity: housing is too expensive for social security income checks. Environmental issues such as air and sound pollution. Housing issues Lack of access to fresh food Community and family support: a lack of support leads to social isolation. Transportation: seniors fear public transportation; do not use Lyft or Uber because of technology. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS Economic insecurity due to living on a fixed income Fear: too scared to reach out for help; feel intimidated. Hearing and vision problems Community and family support: being alone leads to difficulties accessing emergency services. Language barriers Transportation: lack of transportation to health appointments; fear of public transportation. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS FOR SENIORS Lack of follow -up care Language barriers HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT NEEDED Access to healthy food: provide meal delivery programs for seniors or transportation so they can access fresh and healthy groceries. Access to mental/behavioral health services: increase/expand psychiatric support for Medi -Cal and Medicare insured; there is a need for subsidized mental health care. Community and family support programs: create programs that help/prevent seniors from isolation and feeling lonely; encourage family members to help seniors. Database: need a centralized communication database that informs Sharp staff on information about patients that use Sharp services but a re not Sharp members. Home visiting: have a home visiting program where volunteers visit seniors at least 1 time a month. Interpretation experts are needed. Transportation: provide seniors transportation to health care appointments. IMMIGRATION Have you observed any changes over the past year in community members' attitude towards immigration issues? There has been an increased intolerance for those who have immigrated to this country. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 87 Behavioral Health Definition Behavioral health problems include serious psychological distress, suicide, and ment al and substance use disorders including alcohol and drug addiction. Findings Behavioral health needs will be described within two main categories : barriers and SDOH that prevent individuals from obtaining care, and specific services that are most challenging to access. 1. Barriers to accessing care and associated SDOH: Availability of needed services and appointments Insurance issues Logistical problems getting to the needed appointments (time off work, childcare, transportation) Economic security and inability to pay co -pays and deductibles 2. Types of care that are difficult to access: Urgent care services for crisis situations Inpatient psychiatric beds and substance ab use facilities Transitional programs and services (post -acute care services) Behavioral health was identified as a high pri ority health need by both the SM H and HASD&IC 2019 CHNA secondary data analyses and community engagement activities. Secondary Data Findings Data were reviewed related to several aspects of behavioral health in SDC: (1) ED and inpatient discharge rates for some behavioral health conditions, including anxiety and mood disorders; (2) the percent age of people who report having thought about committing suicide; (3) the rate of suicide; (4) ED visit and inpatient discharge rates for acute and chronic substance use; and (5) ED visit and inpatient discharge rates for opioid misuse. Mental Health Issues SDC's rate of ED visits for anxiety increased by 4.3% between 2014 -2016, while rates of inpatient discharges for anxiety decreased by 7.9% during the same time period (see Figure 22). People who identify as \"other\" race and Black/African American had the highest rates of ED visits and inpatient discharge for anxiety. ED visits for mood disorders also increased (5.9%) from 2014 -2016, while inpatient discharges for mood disorders decreased by 2.9% (see Figure 22). Rates for mood Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 88 disorders were higher for people who identify their race as Black/African American than for any other race.

The highest rates for both types of encounter were among Black/African Americans. Steep increases in both types of encounter occurred for chronic substance use; ED visit rates increased by 559.3%, and inpatient discharge rates increased by 195.1% (see Figure 24). ED visit rates were highest among Whites (3 6.7), while inpatient discharge rates were highest among those who identify as \"other\" race. Across age groups, rate s of ED visits for chronic substance abuse increased the most for those ages 65 and older \u2014 by 714 .0%.

SpeedTrack\u00a9 Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 92 Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Across all community engagement activities conducted in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA \u2014 focus groups, interviews and the survey \u2014 behavioral health issues were identified as both prevalent and debilitating. In the online survey, behavioral health was ranked as the health condition having the greatest impact on the health and well -being of San Diego residents and as the second most impactful condition when health conditions and SDOH were combined (only access to care ranked higher). In addition, 63 .0% of survey respondents indicated that they believe behavioral health is worsening in SDC. Re spondents were also asked to rank which specific behavioral health conditions have the greatest impact in San Diego, and they were ranked as follows: 1. Alcohol use disorder 2. Mood disorders 3. Substance use disorder 4. Anxiety 5. Opioid use 6. Suicide and suicidal though ts/ideation 7. Self-harm or self -injury See Appendix S for full results of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA online survey. During focus groups and interviews, frequent topics of discussion related to behavioral health in cluded: Barriers to care The types of care most challenging to access The people who are most impacted by behavioral health issues Table 25 presents a summary of feedback from the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus groups and KI interviews, related to behavioral health. Additional detail is included in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings section below. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups For SM H's 2019 CHNA, a focus group was conducted with members of the Sharp McDonald Center (SMC) Aftercare Support Group . Feedback from these individuals provided the unique perspective of people who have either live d through behavioral health or addiction issues themselves or who have helped loved ones through their recovery . Community engagement feedback addressed barriers to behavioral health care as well as the impact of behavioral health issues \u2014 particularly substance use and addiction on individuals. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 93 Table 26 summarizes the findings of this focus grou p. Additional details are covered in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings section. For a description of focus group participants, see Section 3: Methodology . Behavioral health was mentioned frequently in additional focus groups, including the Sharp Case Management Leadership , SMBHWN Social Workers & Case Managers , Sharp Cancer Navigators and Social Worker , Sharp Senior Health Center staff, patients and communit y members, and Sharp PFAC focus groups. Please see the findings for Aging Concerns , Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy , and Cancer for specific feedback on behavioral health and its connection to these identified health needs. Please refer to Appendix U for a summary of Sharp 2019 CHNA focus groups. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community Sharp's Insight Community online survey provided greater understanding of the identified health need of behavioral health for Sharp patients and community members. Among 16 health conditions, survey respondents (n=380) ranked behavioral/mental health (including substance use, suicide, self -inflicted injury, etc.) as the second most important health condition impacting their community. Refer to Appendix R for the rankin g of the most important health conditions by the Sharp Insight Community survey. Worth noting is that respondents in the youngest age group \u2014 ages 25 -44 years \u2014 were significantly more likely than the sample as a whole to select behavioral/mental health a s one of the top five most important health conditions impacting their community, when compared to all other survey respondents. In fact, as respondent age groups decreased, the identification of behavioral/mental health as a priority health condition incr eased. See Appendix R for age group breakouts for the top most important health conditions. When health conditions and SDOH were combined among all respondents, behavioral/mental health ranked as the fourth most important health need among 30 choices. Please refer back to Figure 14 for the final ranking of health conditions and SDOH by Sharp Insight Community survey participants. After ranking various health conditions and SDOH, Sharp Insight Community survey participants were asked to rate their awareness of select community outreach programs offered by Sharp, including behavioral health support groups. Notabl y, only 6% of respondents were very familiar with Sharp's behavioral he alth support groups, while the majority were either not at all familiar (55%) or somewhat familiar (39%). Further, among the 25 -44 year age group , no respondents indicated that they were very familiar with Sharp's behavioral health support groups \u2014 the age group that was also significantly more likely than the rest of the sample to select behavioral/mental health as one of the five most important health conditions. See Appendix R for details. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 94 Discussion of Commun ity Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups and Key Informant Interviews In the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement process, residents identified several obstacles to the receipt of effective behavioral health services. First, they said, the availability of therapists to address mental health issues and programs to address substance use treatment is extremely limited. Finding providers who accept a patient's insurance creates further obstacles, particularly if the patient is enrolled in a public insurance program like Medi -Cal. In addition, the participants noted, even when therapists or programs can be found, they are often not immediately available, creating challenges to the timely receipt of services. Therapists, it was further discussed, often only have time available during work and school hours and may be located far from where the people who n eed the services live, work, and go to school, creating logistical problems. Finally, for those who are economically insecure, co -pays and deductibles were cited as prohibitive to the receipt of behavioral health services. Two types of care for both mental health and substance use disorders were noted to be insufficient in San Diego during the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement events. Urgent care with availability of after-hours services for people in crisis were cited as a critical need for the community. Inpatient psychiatric beds and substance abuse facilities were also identified as being in short supply. Finally, more transitional programs and services (post -acute care services) for those who are being discharged from the inpatient level of care emerged as a priority need. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group participants emphasized that while accessing behavioral health services is hard for everyone, for people who may be at the highest risk for trauma -related mental il lness \u2014 like veterans, refugees, and the LGBTQ community \u2014 and for those who are uninsured, access to this care can be particularly challenging. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA participants also discussed the link between mental health and substance misuse, arguing th at the failure to provide access to preventive and acute mental health services often leads to self -medicating with drugs and alcohol, which can then exacerbate mental health issues. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups Focus groups conducted with the SMC Afte rcare Support Group identified several barriers to behavioral health care. Specific to substance use disorders, participants stressed the need for more low -cost or free, easily and immediately accessible drug treatment programs. In addition, they described health insurance as both expensive and complicated to obtain. Focus group members also talked about challenges related to post-discharge care for all health conditions, including lack of adequate support at home, navigating denied insurance claims, and me dication management. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 95 SMC Aftercare Support Group focus group participants discussed specific themes related to the impact of substance use and addiction. First, they noted that certain groups are more vulnerable to addiction and mental health issues. Sec ond, they described the spiral of addiction and the cycle of recovery. Third, they talked about how addiction changes people and can lead to premature mortality. Finally, they described the interlinked nature of substance use disorders and mental health di sorders. Focus group participants described young adults in their early to mid -20's and individuals in the LGBTQ community as being most severely affected by addiction. It was noted that these groups appear to become addicted faster than in the past and move on to more potent drugs sooner. Heroin was cited as a particularly common drug with these groups. Opioid misuse was also cited as a growing issue within the senior population. A common scenario for seniors, focus group members explained, is to be presc ribed pain medication for chronic issues such as back pain, to unwittingly become dependent on that medication, and for this dependence to turn into a full -blown addiction. For youth under 18 years of age, anxiety, depression and suicide were noted as grow ing problems. Most people who become addicted, SMC Aftercare Support Group participants said, start out by using drugs recreationally. People use drugs while partying \u2014 smoking or taking pills \u2014 but quickly come to depend on them. Most do not start out in jecting drugs \u2014 they believe they never will. But then, participants articulated, the drug takes over, and they become at the mercy of the drug and resort to injecting. Recovery, participants emphasized, is a cyclical process. While some achieve long -term recovery, many people relapse, and a certain proportion of people go to detox, discharge 30 days later, and immediately relapse. Focus group participants described how addiction \"makes you do the complete opposite of what is good for you\" and \"takes away your soul.\" They described daily lives being centered around getting high \u2014 that drugs are the first thing addicted people think about when they wake up and the last thing they think about before sleep. Once addicted, a person's character is modified, the y said. The addiction causes people to become unproductive and deceptive in service of obtaining drugs. Being addicted, they said, also causes the deterioration of interpersonal relationships and social isolation for the addict. Of greatest concern, SMC Aftercare Support Group contributors emphasized, is the high level of mortality among people with addictions. Every couple of months, they said, someone within their recovery circle passes away. Overdoses are often fatal, and participants explained, people who recover and then relapse are more vulnerable to overdose. This is because, following detox , tolerance for the substance has become much lower. During a relapse, the person often takes the same amount of the drug as they did prior to detoxing, which their bodies can no longer handle. Focus group participants believe that levels of anxiety and depression are increasing in the community. These mental health issues often lead people to cope by using drugs to Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 96 relieve their symptoms, which can lead to dependence and addiction. So cial isolation and loneliness may also lead to drug use , they said. Participants asserted that d rug use, while temporarily relieving some mental health symptoms, participants asserted, ultimately exacerbates anxiety and depression, leading to deeper loneliness, and at times, suicidal ideation and attempts. In addition, although the primary emphasis of the focus group was on behavioral health issues, some SMC Aftercare Support Group members discussed other health issues of concern in the community. Conditions they listed as negatively affecting all residents include heart disease/cardiovascular issues, diabetes and obesity. Seniors, participants noted, struggle with arthritis, limited mobility, chronic pain, Alzheimer's disease, social isolation and food insecurity. Children, they said, are impacted by obesity, diabetes, racial discrimination, bullying, poor eating habits and exposure to dangerous behaviors on social media. Participants also described discrimination as more prevalent than in the past, and that the current environment is such that people feel emb oldened to treat others, particularly immigrants, unkindly. Undocumented workers, they noted, are demonized but used by businesses to generate higher profits. See Table 26 for a summary of feedback from the SMC Aftercare Support Group . Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community The Sharp Insight Community survey reinforced the importance of addressing behavioral health issues, as behavioral/mental health was ranked as the second most important health condition affecting community members. In addition, only the minority of survey respondents (6%) were very familiar with Sharp's behavioral support groups. This i ndicates a missed opportunity to support community members with behavioral health issues, part icularly younger adults ages 25 -44 years, who were most likely to select behavioral/mental health as a prio rity health condition, but who were 'not at all familiar' with Sharp's behavioral health support group offerings. Further, this younger age group was significantly more likely than the other age groups to select stigma as one of the five most important SDO H. Research illustrates that although stigma can exist in a variety of contexts (e.g., immigration status and use of public programs such as food stamps), it is one of the largest barriers for individuals who may seek or engage in treatment for behavioral/ mental health conditions.20 Sharp 2019 CHNA Suggestions Focus group participants from the SMC Aftercare Support Group proposed three ideas to improve behavioral health in the community : Offer more programs like the Sharp McDonald Center. Provide more education for health care providers related to addiction, including when and how to intervene when addiction is suspected, how to prevent addiction to pain medications, how alternative or holistic treatments can be used 20 Ahmedani B. K. (2011). Mental Health Stigma: Society, Individuals, and the Profession. Journal of social work values and ethics , 8(2), 41 -416. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 97 to manage pain, and how to act with compassion and empathy towards people with addiction. Hold forums for seniors to socially engage with each other and to interact with health advocates who would be available to meet with them, discuss their health issues, and help them navigat e the health care system. Sharp Insight Community survey participants also had the opportunity to provide specific suggestions about what Sharp can do to improve the health and well -being of the community. See Appendix R for the most commonly suggested themes. Feedback related to behavioral/mental health included: Speed up the delivery of mental health care; referral to a therapist takes too long if in need of hospitalization. Advocate for improved access and i nsurance coverage for the underserved, particularly to stigmatized services including behavioral health. Offer more mental health resources, including more classes for mental health issues. Additional recommendations from the Sharp Insight Community surve y can be found in Appendix R.

Children and Youth Behavioral/Ment al health: depression, anxiety from social media or bullying, and suicide. Diabetes Obesity SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH Adults Community and family support: negative interpersonal relationships with friends or family that encourage substance use/abuse. Behaviors: less perceived danger of marijuana since legalization. Seniors Access to healthy/nutritious food Economic security: food insecurity. Children and Youth Environment Behaviors: eating habits and diet, excessive sugar intake. Fear/Racial discrimination and bullying: especially for young black children. Parental support: lack of support. Technology: lack of parental control over social media and intern et content exposure. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS Education: access to information, for example November is prostate cancer month but there is no visible promotion for it. Economic security: high cost of health care, large deductibles create a financial burden on individuals. Insurance issues: the complicated process of health care enrollment. Lack of services: accessibility and availability of health care services for addiction. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS Medications and prescription issues: pain medication management is challenging and can lead to prescription drug addiction; over -prescription of opioids to treat back surgery. Insurance: insurance claim issues and the s tress resulting from denied claims. Community and family support: lack of discharge support at home from friends, family members or caretakers. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE Alternative treatment options: physician openness to alternative treatments, such as holistic treatments instead of pain medication. Education: increase physician knowledge through training on topics such as proper bedside manner. HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT NEEDED Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 100 Community support: places or forums for the elderly/seniors to talk and socially engage with one another. Education: o Community members: A place where health advocates are available for community members to discuss health issues. o Providers: More education for provid ers on patient's recovery process; finding alternative treatments to avoid prescription drugs; education on patient struggles and issues and how to empathize. Additional services: more affordable addiction recovery services like Sharp McDonald Center. Mor e beds in addiction recovery programs. Insurance: improve insurance process. Stigma: the system and society treats addiction as shameful. IMMIGRATION Have you observed any changes over the past year in patient/community member attitude towards immigra tion issues? The news/media is driving a lot of the negative talk, especially in regards to \"The Wall\". The current administration has caused this change in attitude. There is a polarization of extremes in political views. People feel emboldened to treat others unkindly and say hateful things while the people being mistreated feel the need to hide or change behaviors to avoid being bullied. Cancer Definition Cancer is a set of diseases in which abnormal cells grow and spread and crowd out normal cells, which can make it difficult for the body to function. Cancer can start anywhere in the body and can spread to other parts \u2014 cancers are named for where they ori ginate in the body. Findings Health needs related to cancer were described in relation to the effects on well -being beyond physical health. These include financial, practical, and emotional impacts on individuals and families; these effects are exacerbat ed by barriers to cancer care. Cancer was identified as a priority health need by the SM H and HASD&IC 2019 CHNAs in both the secondary data analyses and in the community engagement process. Secondary Data Findings For all cancer sites, the age -adjusted rate from 2011 -2015 in San Diego was 402.5 per 100,000; the incidence rates by cancer site are represented in Figure 26 below.

In the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA online survey, cancer was ranked as the fourth most impactful health conditio n for the Sa n Diego community. See Appendix S for a full summary of survey results. In the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus groups and KI interviews, participants described barriers to receiving cancer screenings, diagnosis, and treatment along with the severe, negative impact a cancer diagnosis can have on individuals and their loved ones. See Table 27 for a summary of findings from the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement activities related to c ancer. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Group and KI Interview A focus group with Sharp Cancer Patient Navigators and Social Workers and a KI interview with one Sharp Cancer Patient Navigator/Clinical Social Worker , were 21 2018 Sharp HealthCare Cancer Registry Data 22 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) Non -Public Inpatient Discharge and Emergency Department Encounter Data, 2017. Accessed through SpeedTrack Inc.\u00a9 Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 103 conducted to better understand the unique needs of Sharp cancer patients. Both the focus group and KI interview also informed the development of a case study. Interview and focus group contributors described: barriers to care for cancer patients; the impact of a cancer diagnosis on family dynami cs; the services provided by navigators and social workers and the ways in which they coordinate care with other community organizations; and suggestions for ways in which their work could be better supported. See Table 28 or Appendix U for a summary of the focus group and interview findings. Finally, please refer to Appendix J for the case study of \"Camila\" developed with insight collected fro m both the Sharp Cancer Patient Navigators and Social Workers focus group and the Sharp Cancer Patient Navigator/Clinical Social Worker KI interview. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community Survey Sharp's Insight Community online survey also provided greater understanding of cancer as a concern among Sharp patients and community members. Out of 16 health conditions, respondents (n=380) ranked cancer as the second most important health condition impacting their community (see Appendix R for details). When health conditions and SDOH were combined among all respondents, cancer ranked as the fifth most important health need among a total of 30 choices. Please refer back to Figure 14 for the final ranking of health conditions and SDOH by Sharp Insight Community survey participants. Further, after ranking various health conditions and SDOH, Sharp Insight Community survey participants were asked to rate their awareness of sele ct community outreach programs offered by Sharp, including Sharp's cancer support groups. Notably, only 13% of respondents were 'very familiar' with this offering, while the majority were either 'not at all familiar' (43%) or 'somewhat familiar' (44%). See Appendix R for details. Discussion of Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants described cancer as a health condition that community residents find extremely scary. They discussed how fear about the impact of the cancer and about the stigma of cancer keeps people from accepting their diagnosis and pursuing cancer treatment. Brain, colon and breast cancer were specifically mentioned as d iseases people find particularly intimidating. In addition, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA participants noted that people who have cancer are sometimes judged in the community and worry that others will avoid them once they know of their diagnosis. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 104 Fears about immigr ation status, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group members asserted, have also become a deterrent to receiving cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment. Asylum seekers in particular are hesitant to access cancer care because they believe they will be deported if they do not have insurance. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants highlighted how finances related to cancer care are also burdensome for community members. Even for those with insurance, co -pays and deductibles can be prohibitive. People who have cancer also worry about losing their jobs and about who will take care of their children while they are undergoing treatment. Finally, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants named practical issues, such as transportation to medical appointments, as barriers to receiving cancer screenings and treatment. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Group and KI Interview In both the Sharp Cancer Patient Navigator s and Social Worker focus group and the Sharp Cancer Patient Navigator/Clinical Social Worker KI interview , barriers to effective cancer ca re were summarized as: fear, finances, frustration, and logistics. Community engagement participants detailed the my riad ways that a patient's fear can interfere with the receipt of and compliance with cancer treatment. Denying their illness serves as a coping mechanism for this fear; by starting and complying with treatment patients must acknowledge the reality of thei r disease, and so, they sometimes delay treatment. Sharp Cancer Patient Navigators and Social Workers focus group participants also described how patients will, out of fear, try \"alternative\" treatments instead \u2014 like eliminating sugar, taking high doses of vitamin C, and using herbs and marijuana. They explained that p atients are also often afraid of the side effects of cancer treatment, such as losing their hair and becoming ill. Fears about immigration status, Sharp Cancer Patie nt Navigators and Soci al Worker focus group members asserted, have become much more pronounced. Navigators and social workers described situations in which families have disenrolled from their health insurance out of fear of being placed on a \"list\" for deportation. In addition , sometimes undocumented residents choose not to receive cancer care rather than face the perceived risk of coming to the attention of immigration officials. Sharp Cancer Patie nt Navigators and Social Worker focus group members and KI both emphasized that finances create significant barriers to care. Patients worry about whether they can cover co -pays and co -insurance and how they will cope with any loss of income resulting from time off work during treatment. Relatedly, f rustration related to negotiating insurance claims, Sharp Cancer Patient Navigators and Social Workers reported , is common for patients. Interactions with insurance companies can cause delays, which can cause patients to want to give up on their care. Delays caused by the unavailability o f surgeons and other specialists or related to the commencement of chemotherapy also create patient frustration. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 105 In addition , Sharp Cancer Patient Navigators and Social Workers identified logistical issues, like securing affordable, convenient transportation and covering responsibilities at home, as obstacles to the receipt of cancer care. Practical issues related to post - discharge care were described as particularly challenging , such as when the patient lives alone and has no one to assist with his or her recovery, when the patient is homeless, or when the patient is unable to arrange follow -up medical appointments. Sharp Cancer Patient Navigators and Social Workers expressed great concern about the impact that a cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment may have on families. Communication about diagnosis, treatment, and the types of assistance needed can be challenging for the patient. Engagement participants descri bed how children can be traumatized not only by the prospect of a sick or dying parent but also by additional responsibilities they may have to take on that are beyond their maturity level. Children may provide translation services, transportation, and hea lth care assistance. One 10 - year-old child, for example, had the responsibility for draining her mother's mastectomy bags. Sharp 2019 CHNA Suggestions The Sharp Cancer Patie nt Navigators and Social Worker focus group members and KI had several suggesti ons for how either Sharp or community organizations could support the work of navigators and improve the outcomes of San Diego's community members facing cancer: Assign cancer patients to financial case managers or navigators to help them deal specifical ly and exclusively with health insurance issues. Create a one -stop shop for cancer patients that offer legal and financial services, pain clinics, and wig disbursements \u2014 and house that within the cancer center. Have more staff for the breast cancer patien ts. Offer more post -surgery or post -chemotherapy follow -up to patients. Sharp Insight Community survey participants also had the opportunity to provide specific suggestions about what Sharp can do to improve the health and well -being of the community. See Appendix R for the most commonly suggested themes. Feedback related to cancer included: Be more proactive in terms of get ting patients in for cancer screening ; provide free screenings and online educational webinars . Provide more educational programs, including for cancer. Increase access to primary health care services ; shorten waiting times for primary a nd specialty care appointments. Invest more in post -acute care management . Provide o pportunities for technical education on many areas of medicine; develop decision -making tools for complex patient decisions (e.g., prostate cancer treatment ).

Table 27: HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Focus Group and KI Interview Summary of Responses Related to Cancer SUMMARY OF RESPONSES RELATED TO CANCER ASSOCIATED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND NEEDS Brain cancer Breast cancer Cancer (all types, especially in older populations) Chronic diseases : stress leads to increased cortisol levels which over time is linked to increases in chronic diseases such as asthma, heart disease, and cancer ASSOCIATED SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH Healthy behaviors: poor diet, and lack of physical activity Physical environment: chemical exposures from industrial sites, and from being in war zones prior to arriving in the U.S. Substance use : tobacco, alcohol misuse Stigma : fear of community stigmatization due to cancer diagnosis ACCESS TO SERVICES BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES Cost Delays to see specialists, like surgeons Fear of a diagnosis therefore people delay addressing serious health issue until it progresses too far Fear related to immigration status Frustration with navigating insurance issues Logistical issues such as transportation, childcare and home responsibilities Preventative care : people believe they are healthy due to not having any physical symptoms, therefore do not receive preventative care Screenings : avoidance of screenings, specifically breast cancer Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 107 Table 28: Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Heal thCare Cancer Patient Navigators and Social Worker Focus Group and KI Interview Summary of Responses SHARP HEALTHCARE CANCER PATIE NT NAVIGATORS AND SOCIAL WORKER - SUMMARY OF RESPONSES SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH - PATIENT AND FAMILY Access to health care specifically for recovery issues, post -surgery or post -treatment. Community and family support Patients sometimes hide cancer status from their children. Sometimes it is due to the young age of their children. Patients do not want to ask for help, th ey want to manage their health condition on their own. Lack of caregivers Lack of effective communication between patient and family members, especially senior patients. Transportation problems getting to health services Financial issues and needs relate d to their care plans Insurance Issues (i.e. having Medi -Cal, but no supplemental income) Homelessness: some patients live in cars Language barrier becomes a problem when trying to accurately translate cancer status to patient and family YOUTH ROLES IN FAMILY CARE Children will often take on a role reversal when their parent is sick. Children provide transportation Children provide translation ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS Economic security Fear o Fear and pain management are challenges for head and neck cancer patients. o Patients do not want chemotherapy because they do not want to lose their hair. o Patients fear the impact of treatment and are scared of the future and its uncertainty. o Sometimes other people will instill fear in the patients and tell them to partake in certain activities such as not eating sugar or going to Mexico to get their cancer treatments. Mental health issues and substance misuse can create challenges in care. Untimely access to provid ers and treatment, due to insurance issues or lack of providers to render services. Provider shortage Treatment compliance: providers may be unaware of a patient's psychiatric history which may complicate treatment compliance. Conflicting treatments : some patients use holistic methods such as herbs and vitamin C therapy that may interact with treatments. HOSPITAL COMMUNICATION Do you or your staff interact with community clinics, social services organizations, or other community resources in any way to support patients/their families? Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 108 Referrals are made to resources such as financial services, In -Home Care, transportation, and housing. o Based on identified needs they refer to Komen Foundation or Cancer society. o Jewish Family Services and Mama's Kitchen are organizations that social workers and navigators rely on. o For patients with mental health issues or suicide ideation, social workers and navigators will call Sharp Mesa Vista to refer patients to a psychiatris t. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS Lack of family support : issues when there is no one at home for the patient to be discharged to. Homeless : when the patient does not have a home. Medications : when the patient has no access to their medications. Follow -up care : lack of follow -up care. Insurance issues , especially when patients have no outpatient care coverage. Education : some caregivers lack health education or are not capable of effectively being a caregiver. HOSPITAL AND COMMUNIT Y SUPPORT NEEDED Financial navigators : there is a need for financial navigators to help oncology patients navigate their health insurance policy. One stop shop for patients that includes all the services they may need during this time, such as pain management clinics, wig disbursement, and help with legal issues. Additional staff : there is a need for more staff for breast cancer patients. Follow -up care : after surgery and chemotherapy follow up care. Education : patients need more education and support during this process such as education around why going back to work is not advisable. Legal Services: there is a need for more assistance with legal services and l awyers. Legal issues arise for some patients on immigration, custody of children, divorce, or work -related issues on discrimination. IMMIGRATION Have you observed any changes over the past year in patient/community member attitude towards immigration issues? Patients are afraid to talk when it comes to their citizenship status. Many patients dis enrolled from their health insurance out of fear of being on a \"list\". There has been an increase in inpatient care due to placing patients on restricted Medi -Cal and then admitting them to obtain treatment and needed tests and scans such as MRI's. These services would otherwise not occur if the patient wer e an outpatient due to insurance. Many immigrants debate stopping treatment or just leaving the country all together. In terms of access to health care, there are a lot of legal and family issues involved. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 109 Chronic Health Conditions (Cardiovascular disease, Diabetes, Obesity) Definition The Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) defines chronic health conditions as those that last at least one year and require ongoing medical care and/or limit activities of daily living. Three chronic health conditions were identified as being of primary concern during the 2019 CHNA: CVD , diabetes and obesity. CVD refers to a set of conditions related to the heart and blood vessels, including: heart disease, heart attack, stroke, heart failure, arrhythmia, and heart valve problems. The most common form of CVD is heart disease, and the most common heart disease i s coronary artery disease ( CAD - also referred to as coronary heart disease). Diabetes is a set of diseases that affect the way the body metabolizes sugar (glucose). The three primary types of diabetes are: Type 2 (the most common type), Type 1, and gesta tiona l (occurring during pregnancy). Overweight or obese people weigh more than is considered healthy for a given height. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a screening tool for overweight and obesity that divides people's weight by the square of their height. Obes ity is defined in adults as having a BMI of 30.0 or higher. For children, obesity is defined as having a BMI at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex. Findings The chronic health conditions of CVD , diabetes and obesity were i dentified as priority health need s by both the SM H and HASD&IC 2019 CHNA secondary data analyses and community engagement efforts . The community engagement activities identified key factors that community members struggle with to prevent chronic diseases , including access to fresh, healthy foods and safe places to exercise and play. In addition, barriers to care, SDOH, and disease management were identified as particularly difficult for those with chronic health conditions. This included: Economic secur ity Transportation Immigration fears Lack of knowledge on health condition Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 110 Secondary Data Findings Cardiovascular Disease The r ates of ED visits for coronary heart disease increased by 35.3% from 2014 -2016.

In 2017, males represented 38.5% of all ED visits at SMH but 43.2% of ED visits with a CVD diagnosis. In addition, males accounted for 44.1% of ED visits where CVD was the principal diagnosis. In 2017, individuals ages 65 and older accounted for 49.9%, a nd individuals ages 45-64 accounted for 37.7%, of visits to the ED at SMH with a CVD diagnosis. Type 2 Diabetes In 2017, the top three ED and inpatient Type 2 diabetes diagnoses at SMH included Type 2 diabetes (uncomplicated), Type 2 diabetes with Chronic Kidney Disease, and Type 2 diabetes with hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). In 2017, males represented 48.6% of all inpatient discharges at SMH, but 68.0% of inpatient discharges where Type 2 diabetes was the principal diagnosis. Among individuals admitt ed to SMH with a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis in 2017, 61.0% were ages 65 and older, and 33.2% were ages 45 -64. Among individuals who visited the ED at SMH with a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis in 2017, 44.1% were ages 65 and older 40.7% and were ages 45 -64. Individuals identified as Hispanic or Latino represented 18.7% of all inpatient discharges at SMH in 2017, but 24.2% of discharges with a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Obesity In 2017, females represented 57.0% of all inpatient discharges, and 70.7% of ED visits , at SMH where an obesity diagnosis was present. Among individuals admitted to SMH with an obesity diagnosis in 2017, 41.8% were ages 45 -64, and 39.0% were ages 65 and older. Among individuals who visited the ED at SMH with an obesity diagnosis in 2017, 51.7% were ages 18 -44, and 48.5% were ages 45 -64.

Accessed through SpeedTrack Inc.\u00a9 Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 115 Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA CVD, diabetes and cancer were the chronic health conditions most frequently discussed by community members as priority health needs in SDC. In the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA online survey, these conditions were ranked as three of the five most impactful health con ditions on the overall well -being of San Diegans. In addition, of those who chose obesity as the greatest influence on poor health outcomes, 51.0% identified obesity as growing worse within SDC . Conversations about chronic health conditions in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus groups centered on barriers to care, particularly related to prevention and disease management, and on specific challenges faced by vulnerable populations. See Table 29 for a summary of findings from the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement activities related to chronic health conditions. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups A focus group conducted with the Sharp PFAC highlighted both CVD \u2014 including stroke \u2014 and diabetes as chronic health conditions of particular concern. In addition, a focus group conducted with Sharp Case Manage ment Leadership specifically cited diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure ( CVD ) as chronic health conditions that severely impact Sharp's more vulnerable patient populations; that is, the populations experiencing greater health disparities than others. Please refer to Tables 21 and 22 or Appendi x U for a summary of these findings. The Discussion of Community Engagement Findings below highlights those focus group findings that specifically connect to chronic health conditions. Lastly, a focus group conducted with Sharp Diabetes Health Educators facilitated a better understanding of the unique health needs of Sharp's diabetes patients . Please refer to Table 30 or Appendix U for a summary of Sharp Diabetes Health Educator focus group findings. For a description of all Sharp focus group participants, see Appendix K and Appendi x L. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community Sharp's Insight Community online survey provided greater understanding of chronic health conditions of concern among Sharp patients and community members. Out of 16 health conditions, respondents (n=380) ranked obesity as the third most important Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 116 health condition impacting their community, while ranking heart disease (coronary) and diabetes (types 1 and 2) fourth and fifth, respectively ( see Appendix R for details). When health conditions and SDOH were combined among all respondents, obesity, heart disease, diabetes and health behaviors all ranked within the top 10 most important health needs among 30 choices. Please refer back to Figure 14 for the final ranking of health conditions and SDOH by Sharp Insight Community survey participants. Further, after ranking various health conditions and SDOH, Sharp Insight Community survey participants were asked to rate their awareness of select com munity outreach programs offered by Sharp. This included the education programs Sharp offers in partnership with the City of San Diego on various health and healthy lifestyle topics, including chronic health conditions such as diabetes, as well as heart he alth and nutrition. Notably, only 9% of respondents were 'very familiar' wit h these education programs, while the majority were either not at all familiar (46%) or somewhat familiar (45%). See Appendix R for deta ils. Discussion of Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group participants repeatedly asserted that in order to prevent CVD, diabetes and obesity, community members must have economic and geographic access to fresh, healthy foods and to safe places to exercise and play. Focus group participants felt that some San Diego neighborhoods have an overabundance of fast food restaurants and convenience stores and far fewer g rocery stores featuring affordable fresh produce, which makes healthy eating economically and logistically challenging. In addition, some neighborhoods lack safe, ope n places to play and exercise. In addition, in some families, they said, the adults work l ong hours to earn enough to cover their necessities, leaving little time for healthy cooking and exercise. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group participants noted that concerns about finances create obstacles to the effective management of chronic conditions l ike CVD and diabetes. Co -pays for doctor's visits and medications, loss of income due to time off work, and the cost of transportation to medical appointments are prohibitive. Focus group participants described instances in which people had to choose betwe en feeding their families and getting their medications. Immigration fears, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA f ocus group participants said, keep some of them from getting the health care they need to manage their conditions. Many undocumented residents fear being place d on an \"alert list\" for immigration officials when receiving health care. R esidents who are attempting to become U.S. citizens fear that the receipt of services will interfere with th eir ability to become naturalized . Lack of knowledge, one participant as serted, is another primary obstacle to disease Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 117 management. Individuals may be unaware of how to manage their diseases and unsure about how to secure resources to assist them. Further, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group participants emphasized that managing chronic health conditions is particularly troublesome for two groups: (1) homeless and insecurely housed individuals and (2) seniors. For homeless and insecurely housed individuals, managing medical appointments and the storage of insulin were frequently mentioned as barriers to diabetes management. For seniors, transportation to care and the management of medication were discussed as especially challenging. For additional details on the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement findings, please refer to the fu ll HASD&IC 2019 CHNA at: https://hasdic.org/2019 -chna/ . Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups Participants in the Sharp PFAC and Sharp Case Management Leadership focus groups discussed the conditions most negatively impacting the community, barriers to accessing care, and suggestions for ways in which patient/community health outcomes could be improved. Please refer to Tables 21 and 22 at the end of this section for a summary of these findings. The discussion below highlights those focus group findings that specifically connect to chronic health conditions. In the Sharp Diabetes Health Educator focus group, the discussion focused on diabetes. Topics covered were those barriers to disease management for diabetic patients; the impact of diabetes on an individual and his/her family; the services provided by Sharp diabetes health educators and the ways in which they coordinate care with other community organizations; and suggestions for ways in which their work could be better supported. Please refer to Table 30 at the end of this section, as well as Appendix U, for a s ummary of Sharp Diabetes Health Educator focus group findings. In the Sharp PFAC focus group, barriers to care connected to chronic disease management included economic insecurity (including food insecurity), housing and insurance issues, challenges with navigating the health care system, lack of health literacy, fears regarding immigration issues, and cultural and language barriers. Essentially, the very same barriers that have a critical impact on access to care. For a deeper discussion of these barrier s, please refer to the Access to Health Care section. During the focus group conducted with Sharp Case Management Leadership , barriers to accessing care were discussed extensively. Participants cited m any factors that serve as obstacles to quality care for vulnerable populations, including economic and food insecurity, housing, challenges with insurance for patients and for hospitals, fears related to immigration status, waiting lists for appointments, and issues specific to discharge care. Regarding chronic disease management, the barriers of economic security, housing, waiting lists and discharge challenges were noted in particular. For a deeper discussion of these barriers, please refer to the Access to Health Care section. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 118 In the Sharp Diabetes Health Educator focus group several barriers to effective diabetes management were described, including challenges with finances, pharmacies, and insurance policies, fear, and lack of knowledge/cultural beliefs about food and illness. Focus group participants noted that c oncerns about finances create obstacles to effective diabetes management for their patients: co -pays for doctor's visits and medications, loss of income due to time off work, and the cost of transportation to medical appointments are prohibitive. Health ed ucators described instances in which patients had to choose between feeding their families and getting their medications \u2014 and the inability to purchase healthy foods further exacerbates their diabetes. The Sharp Diabetes Health Educator focus group also described challenges patients face with pharmacies \u2014 prescription renewals are sometimes denied because a physician fails to use the right language on a prescription and the pharmacists are unwilling or unable reach out to the doctor to resolve the is sue. In addition, many pharmacies do not offer discount programs, creating further financial stress, and while some pharmacies will ensure that patients have testing strips and supplies, others will not. Relatedly, focus group participants also noted that insurance issues , such as a \"donut hole24\" that creates challenges for some patients to receive medications between August and January, are also problematic. In addition, Sharp Diabetes Health Educator focus group participants identified f ears related to two subjects that prevent people from getting the care they need. First, for undocumented immigrants, concerns about revealing their immigration status may keep them from getting health care. Second, for people in certain professions, su ch as pilots and tr uck drivers , the use of ins ulin can result in job loss, leading them to avoid using this medication. Further, focus group participants asserted that l ack of knowledge is another primary obstacle to disease management for their patients. In particular, pa tients are often unaware of their rights as employees to, for example, take breaks to check their blood sugar. In addition, participants said, cultural beli efs about food and illness at times do not align with effective diabetes care. For example, among so me groups, it is common to eat very late at night and to only eat twice a day \u2014 both of which make controlling blood sugar difficult. For other groups, eating high carbohydrate foods, like rice, with most meals is routine, and it can be difficult to change these behaviors . In addition, the Sharp Diabetes Health Educators cited several impacts of diabetes management that can also create barriers. \"Diabetes,\" one focus group participant explained, \"is a never -ending disease that includes a long journey of self -management. This takes a toll on the patient's psyche as well as their work and family life.\" Sharp Diabetes Health Educators described diabetes patients as, at times, feeling isolated and lonely. They experience, health educators said, a great deal of stigma \u2014 they are 24 Most plans with Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D) have a coverage gap (called a \"donut hole\"). This means that aft er the individual and their insurance plan have spent a certain amount of money for covered prescriptions, the individual must p ay all costs out -of-pocket for their prescriptions up to a yearly limit. Once the individual has spent up to the yearly limit, their coverage gap ends and their insurance plan helps pay for covered prescriptions again. Source: https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/donut -hole- medicare -prescription -drug/ Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 119 blamed for their disease and feel guilt and shame as a result. At times, this stigma is reinforced by physicians. Families, participants said, may not be supportive of dietary changes. The associated co -morbidities, including cardiovascular issues, kidney issues, neuropathy, and vision issues are also im pactful. Attempting to manage their health, focus group participants emphasized, can therefore cause diabetes patients to feel overwhelmed and depressed. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community Feedback regarding the most important SDOH was also obtain ed from Sharp Insight Community survey participants (see Appendix R), and this feedback had profound implications for chronic health conditions . Notably, among 14 choices, health behaviors (diet, physical and sex ual activity, tobacco and substance use) were ranked as the third most important SDOH impacting the community. According to the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) , lack of physical activity and poor nutrition are risk factors for o besity25, while poor diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use contribute to heart disease and diabetes.26 All three of these health conditions \u2014 obesity, heart disease and diabetes \u2014 were identified as priority health conditions in the SMH and HASD&IC 2019 CHNAs. Sharp 2019 CHNA Suggestions Sharp 2019 CHNA focus group participants provided several suggestions to improve the health and well -being of patients and community members, particularly related to the chronic health conditions they experience. In the Sharp PFAC focus group, suggestions focused around access to care and care coordination, which would have a significant impact on chronic disease management. Specific suggestions included: Prioritize the hiring and training of social workers. Soci al workers can coordinate care, create discharge plans, and make follow -up appointments. Patients are in need of a supportive advocate at the time of discharge. Offer free post -surgery home visits. Make follow -up phone calls to see if patients who have bee n discharged are doing well and getting proper follow -up care. Make in -home care more accessible, particularly for older patients. In the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group, suggestions centered around improved care coordination and programming that would also help address SDOH that challenge patient health. It was repeatedly emphasized that health outcomes could not 25 County of San Diego HHSA. Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics.

Specific suggestions included: Ensure 2 -1-1 CIE27 access for all Sharp facilities. Establish more patient -centered initiatives. House a program onsite at hospitals that helps place people in housing, and gets them referrals/helps with applications to affordable housing. Create more home -based support s ervices and adult day centers to help patients transition back to the community or home after hospital discharge. Establish a more streamlined process and a communication system between the hospitals and the County about those who qualify for wraparound se rvices, such as Whole Person Wellness. Sharp Diabetes Health Educators had several suggestions for ways in which their work could be better supported and their patients' health improved: Provide a 24 -hour pharmacy in the Outpatient Pavilion, at Sharp M emorial Hospital. Build partnerships with organizations that provide transportation and food/meal services. Make sure health care providers are aware that the diabetes education department exists and allow them to refer out from Sharp Rees -Stealy. Improve technology: they need telehealth capability, the ability to download a patient's glucose device, Wi -Fi, and access to the Cloud. Providers on their team need to sign off on prescriptions \u2014 otherwise it is \"time lost\" in terms of disease progression. Add p sychologists to their team who can vet patients for organ transplants. Give the Diabetes Educators more office space. Add social workers to their team. Sharp Insight Community survey participants also had the opportunity to provide specific suggestions a bout what Sharp can do to improve the health and well -being of the community. See Appendix R for the most commonly suggested themes. Feedback related to chronic health conditions included: Make nutrition/weight loss assistance free and continue to encourage diet and nutrition education. Implement healthy living strategies in schools to avoid some of the issues that affect communities as adults (prevention). Network with other health care providers to provide a seamless approach to community health. 27 2-1-1 San Diego's Community Information Exchange (CIE) is an ecosystem comprised of multidisciplinary network partners that use a shared language, a resource database, and an integrated technology platform to deliver enhanced community care planning . Care planning tools enable partners to integrate data from multiple sources and make bi -directional referrals to create a shared longitudinal record.

IMMIGRATION Have you observed any changes over the past year in patient/community member attitude towards immigration issues? The group has observed changes in attitudes toward immigrant issues and stated that it is most noticeable in the Chula Vista location . There is fear of crossing the border from the South Bay . Community and Social Support Definition Community support refers to the resources available within an individual's neighborhood to promote the well -being of the residents. Social support is defined as the types of help that people receive from other individuals including emotional, practical and informational assistance. Findings Community and social support were identified as a priority health need by both the SM H and HASD&IC 2019 CHNAs in the community engagement process. For health care in particular, community -clinical linkages that provide social support are cr itical. Per the CDC, community -clinical linkages are defined as connections between community and clinical sectors to improve population health. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 124 Secondary Data Findings SDC data related to the number of F edera lly Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), the percent of the population with limited English proficiency, and the percent of the population who are linguistically isolated were studied as proxies for the level of available community and social support in the county. FQHCs are community assets that provide health care to vulnerable populations. In particular , they promote access to ambulatory care in areas designated as medically underserved. There are 3.17 FQHCs per 100,000 persons in SDC according to the U.S. Departm ent of Health and Human Services Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Although this is higher than the rate for California (2.5) and the U.S. (2.5), individual health centers may not have large enough capacity to deliver the services required for the populations they serve. In recent years, the role of FQHCs has evolved beyond providing a ccess to health care services. FQHCs are medical homes and health homes that not only provide case management for health care needs, they also coordinate their patie nts' access to social services. FQHCs often screen and assess for a wide -range of SDOH and connect patients to inter nal resources or community -based services. Regarding linguistic and cultural barriers, with SDC's large immigrant and refugee population, t he indicators of limited Englis h proficiency and linguistic isolation are especially important to understanding who m ight lack social support as a result of these factors . According to the American Community Survey ( ACS), approximately 14.5% of San Diego r esidents age s 5 and older speak a language other than English at home and speak English less than \"very well.\" In addition, 6.8% of the population age s 5 and older live in a home in which no person age 14 or older speaks only English, or speaks a non -Engli sh language but does not speak English \"very well.\" Similar to those with limited English proficiency, linguistically isolated popul ations may struggle with accessing health services, communicating with health care providers, and understanding health infor mation. Please see Table 31 below for more information on how SDC compares to the state and nation.

Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Community members in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified community and social support as extremely important to the health of SDC residents. In the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community online survey, community and social support was ranked as one of the five most influential SDOH in SDC. During HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group and KI interviews, participants emphasized three topics related to community and social support: Well-being is enhanced when people have adequate community and social support. When communities are disproportionately affected by economic stress and/or a poor physical environment, community engagement and the community spirit are affected. For certain populations, t he receipt of services within their community is an important strategy to overcome barriers to care. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups Community and social support was identified as having a significant impact on health outcomes and well -being across al l of the Sharp/SM H 2019 CHNA focus groups, including: Sharp Diabetes Health Educators , SMBHWN Case Managers & Social Workers, Sharp Case Management Leadership , Sharp Cancer Patient Navigators and Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 126 Social Worker , Sharp Senior Health Center staff and patients/community members, SMC Aftercare Support Group members and Sharp PFAC members. Focus group participants also discussed community and social support specifically in connection to access to care challenges. Further details are included in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings below. Please refer to Appendix U for a summary of all SM H/Sharp 2019 CHNA focus groups. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community Sharp's Insight Community online survey provided greater understanding of community and social support as an identified health need among Sharp patients and community members. Among 14 SDOH, respondents (n=380) ranked community and social support ( including social interaction/engagemen t, cultural and linguistic support) as the ninth most important SDOH impacting their community. See Appendix R. When health conditions and SDOH were combined among all respondents, community and social support ranked as the 16th most important health need among 30 choices. Please refer back to Figure 14 for the final ranking of health conditions and SDOH by Sharp Insight Community survey participants. Discussion of Community Engag ement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group contributors frequently identified the support of family, friends and community as necessary to good health. People who are lonely or isolated, they said, are impacted physically and emotionally, whereas people who are connected to others feel better and are more motivated to stay healthy. In addition, contributors emphasized, people may be more likely to seek and receive both health and social services if they are able to do so within their own communities. The receipt of community -based services reduces logistical barriers to care, such as obtaining transportation. In addition, focus group participants explained, individuals are less hesitant to accept care from organiz ations that feel like part of their community. In addition, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group participants emphasized that the ability of people within a community to be civically engaged and supportive of other residents is impacted by economic stress and en vironmental conditions. When residents are focused on economic survival \u2014 paying rent and securing food for their families \u2014 they are less likely to be involved in their communities. In addition, residents are less likely to be active in their communities that suffer from air pollution, poor housing conditions, and lack of pleasan t recreational areas like parks . Further, the essential \"spirit\" of communities that lack healthy conditions is affected, and this in turn negatively impacts residents' ability to support one another. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 127 HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group members also stressed that particular populations are deeply in need of services within their communities. This is especially true, they emphasized, for immigrants who are fearful about their legal status; these individuals are far more likely to trust information they receive from people within their communities and to believe that they will not be reported to authorities when they receive services. Community -based support and services are also important, focus group participants said, for people from other cultures. Trust is built, they explained, when services are offered by people within the community who are either from similar cultural backgrounds or who make the effort to immerse themselves in a commu nity. Seniors would also benefit from having services that are offered closer to home and within a familiar neighborhood. Finally, those who are homeless are more likely to receive and be compliant with health care services, focus group members said, if cl inics are available in the communities in which they reside. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups Sharp PFAC focus group participants described community and social support specifically in connection to its impact on vulnerable populations navigating the health care system, pa rticularly seniors. For seniors and other individuals living alone, inadequate support at home was noted to be a concern, including: having enough food; transportation to follow -up appointments; and support in understanding new prescr iptions and reconciling previous medications with a new medication regimen. Sharp PFAC focus group participants also explained that trying to understand and utilize the health care system and insurance can be physically and mentally exhausting; which is on ly exacerbated for those who lack community and social support. Please refer to Table 21 or Appendix U for a summary of feedback from the Sharp PFAC focus group. Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants highlighted lack of family support, lack of a caregiver upon discharge and lack of childcare assistance as elements of community and social support that have devastating impacts on the health and we ll-being of their patients. In addition, for patients who are elderly, it is a significant challenge to locate affordable short -term caregivers upon discharge from the hospital. Please refer to Table 22 or Appendix U for a summary of feedback from the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group. Community and social support was mentioned frequently throughout the Sharp Diabetes Health Educator, SMBHWN Social Workers & Case Managers, Sha rp Cancer Navigators and Social Worker, and Sharp Senior Health Center staff , patients and community member focus groups as well. Please see the findings for Aging Concerns , Diabet es, Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy and Cancer for specific feedback on community and social support and its connection to these identified health needs . Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 128 Sharp 2019 CHNA Suggestions Sharp PFAC suggestions that specifically address community and social support included: Prioritize the hiring and training of social workers. Patients are in need of a supportive advocate at the time of discharge. Offer free post-surgery home visits. Make follow -up phone calls to see if patients who have been discharged are doing well and getting proper follow -up care. Make in -home care more accessible, particularly for older patients. Sharp Case Management Leadership sugges tions that specifically address community and social support included: Ensure 2 -1-1 CIE28 access for all Sharp facilities. Create more home support services and adult day centers to help patients transition back to the community or home after hospital dis charge. Establish a more streamlined process and a communication system between the hospitals and the County about those who qualify for wraparound services, such as Whole Person Wellness. Sharp Insight Community survey participants also had the opportu nity to provide specific suggestions about what Sharp can do to improve the health and well -being of the community . See Appendix R for the most commonly suggested themes. Feedback related to community and social support included: Mobile Units \u2014 if it is possible to go out to the public, it could help address some of the transportation concerns and even help with some of the stigma concerns by coming to the patient and making it convenient to be seen. Partner with schools to start health education early. Network with other health care providers to provide a seamless approach to community health. Actively advocate for health care reform to ensure fair, equitable health care for everyone.

Source : https://ciesandiego.org/what -is-cie/ Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 129 Economic Security Definition Economic security refers to the ability to meet essential financial needs sustaina bly, including those for food, shelter, clothing, hygiene, health care and education. Economic insecurity is associated with: Poor mental health days Visits to the ED for heart attacks Asthma Obesity Diabetes Stroke Cancer Smoking Pedestrian injury Economic insecurity may also lead to food insecurity, which is linked to: Fair or poor health, anemia and asthma in children Mental health problems, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and oral health problems in adults Fair or poor health, depression and limitations in activities of daily living in seniors Findings For the purposes of this report, chief areas of economic security include poverty, wages and food insecurity. Economic security was identified as a priority health need by the SM H and HASD&IC 2019 CHNAs in the secondary data analyses and in the community engagement process. Secondary Data Findings Data are available related to three indicators of economic security in SDC: the percent of the population living in poverty; the unem ployment rate; and the percent of the population who are food insecure. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 130 Poverty For 2019, the federal pov erty guidelines range from $12, 490 for a 1 -person household, to $25,750 for a 4 -person household, to $43,430 for an 8 -person household. In SDC, 13.3% of residents live below the federal poverty guidelines, and 17.1% of children live in poverty. Poverty rates vary by race (see Figure 35 below) : Figure 3 5: Percent of the Population below 100% Poverty Level in SDC, 2013 -2017 Source: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2013 -2017 5 -Year Estimates. *Non -Hispanic White **Native Hawai ian and Other Pacific Islander ***American Indian and Alaska Native Unemployment In 2018, the average unemployment rate in SDC was 3.3%.

Food insecurity Food insecurity is defined as not always having enough food for everyone in the household to lead an active, healthy life. In San Diego: 14% of people experience food insecurity (1 in 7 people) 9% of seniors experience food insecurity (1 in 11 seniors) 22% of children live in food insecure households (more than 1 in 5 children) Please see Appendix O for Economic Security definition and secondary source information. Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Economic insecurity was identifie d as a priority health need in each of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement activities and was described as impacting \"every aspect\" of residents' daily lives. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA online survey results indicate that San Diegans believe that economic i nsecurity is profoundly impactful on the on the overall health and well -being of the community. Economic insecurity was ranked as the third most influential condition on well -being, after access to care and behavioral health. In addition, 55 .0% of survey respondents reported that they believe that the economic situation in San Diego has gotten worse over time.

See Table 32 for a summary of findings from these community engagement activities. Additional details are included in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings below. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups Economic security was identified as having a significant impact on health outcomes and well-being consist ently across all of the Sharp/SM H 2019 CHNA focus groups, including: Sharp Diabetes Health Educators , SMBHWN Case Managers & Social Workers, Sharp Case Management Leadership , Sharp Cancer Patient Navigators and Social Worker , Sharp Senior H ealth Center staff and senior patients/community members and Sharp PFAC members. Additional details are included in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings below. Please refer to Appendix U for a summary of all SM H/Sharp focus groups. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community Survey Sharp's Insight Community online survey provided greater understanding of economic security as an SDOH impacting Sharp patients and community members. Among 14 SDOH, survey respondents (n=380) ranked economic security ( including consistent access to healthy food, financial stability, employment) as the fourth most important SDOH impacting their community (see Appendix R). When hea lth conditions and SDOH were combined among all respondents, economic security ranked as the seventh most important health need among 30 choices. Please refer back to Figure 14 for the final ranking of health conditions and SDOH by Sharp Insight Community survey participants . Discussion of Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants identified housing and childcare costs as the two primary contributors to economic insecurity in SDC. Low wages were also cited as an underlying cause but were discussed but with less frequency. Housing costs were repea tedly named as a cause of economic stress. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants asserted that rent is disproportionate to income in San Diego, and that for many people, a very high percentage of their wages must be used to cover this cost, l eaving them with too little money to cover other basic Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 133 expenses. Although community members are aware of affordable housing programs, they indicated that these programs have long waiting lists and are inaccessible to most people. Community e ngagement parti cipants described multiple ways that San Diegans try to cope with housing costs, including living in small spaces with multiple families or roommates or in substandard housing without adequate facilities. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participan ts also cited childcare costs as a financial concern for San Diego families. Participants asserted that for those residents who participate in a welfare -to-work program, subsidized childcare is available, but for others it is either unavailable or inaccess ible due to waiting lists. In terms of its impact, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants focused on three main concerns about economic hardship. First, they talked about the association between economic insecurity and food insecurity. Secon d, they described how health maintenance necessarily becomes a low priority when incomes are not secure. Third, they explained that people who are financially unstable experience chronic stress and anxiety, which undermines their health and daily functioni ng. Community members told many stories about friends, relatives, colleagues, and neighbors who struggle with food insecurity on a regular basis. Further, the community asserted, people who are food insecure must find cheap meals , which results in frequent dining at fast food restaurants and the purchase of lower cost, processed foods rather than fresh foods. The community is aware of available benefits, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and local food pantries, but these programs, they emphasized are, at times, inconvenient and challenging to obtain, and are often inadequate to cover a family's nutritional needs. When making difficult financial decisions about which essential needs to cover, the community voiced that inv esting in health maintenance becomes a low priority. Purchasing health insurance, they explained, is expensive, and when people are worried about having enough to eat, spending money on something that they may not need does not make sense to them. Because of co -pays, co -insurance and lost wages due to time off work, visits to the doctor for preventive care or for an acute illness can be finically prohibitive even for those who have health insurance. In addition, participants explained that when people are working long hours and are exce ssively worried about finances, taking the time for activities that promote good health, like home cooking and exercise, simply isn't feasible. Finally, the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants were clear that the chronic stress and anxiety of being financially insecure takes a toll on health. Emotional well -being and mental health are threatened, they explained, by constant worry and anxiety. Physical health is also compromised by being unable to care for ones elf adequately. Community engagement participants stressed that for certain people, economic insecurity is especially impactful. This included: Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 134 Children Seniors People living in rural areas, due to lack of access to social support Homeless individuals Sharp 2019 CHN A - Focus Groups Sharp PFAC focus group participants specifically cited economic security and financial issues as barriers to care, health and well -being. Economic insecurity was discussed as a primary contributor to poor health. Sharp PFAC focus group participants indicated food insecurity also worsens health, and leads to the purchase of cheap , unhealthy food, which is easier for families to access than nutritious food. Seniors, participants said, are particularly vulnerable to food in security. Generally, Sharp PFAC focus group participants viewed l imited finances as a primary barrier to care. The cost of health insurance, co -pays, and transportation, contributors emphasized, prevents people from getting necessary health care. Sharp P FAC focus group participants explained that people in the community are often faced with competing priorities for limited finances, and when the choice is between food or medicine, they choose food. Participants highlighted that these circumstances are especially severe for seniors, particularly those seniors who live alone. Please refer to Table 21 or Appendix U for a summary of fe edback from the Sharp PFAC focus group. In the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group, economic security came up repeatedly as a significant barrier to care, specifically calling out housing and economic stress. Focus group participants discussed ec onomic insecurity was discussed as a barrier to effective management of health care, particularly chronic health conditions. For example, participants noted that many people cannot afford to take time off work for medical appointments, so they attempt to m anage their care around their work schedule. Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants also cited that certain medications are particularly expensive, and, related to this, many patients also experience food insecurity. Consequently, one fo cus group participant shared that patients on a limited income have a hard time choosing between paying their copays and for their medications and eating. This, the participant emphasized, occurs even with those who are insured. In addition, Sharp Case M anagement Leadership focus group participants highlighted that housing costs and concerns also keep people from getting care. \"Their main concern,\" one participant noted, \"is having a home to live in rather than managing their own care....so there is a tende ncy to delay receiving health care until an emergency situation arises.\" Please refer to Table 22 or Appendix U for a summary of feedback from the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group. Economic security was mentioned consistently throughout the Sharp Diabetes Health Educator, SMBHWN Social Workers & Case Managers, Sharp Cancer Navigators and Social Worker, and Sharp Senior Health Center focus groups as well. Please see the Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 135 findings for Aging Concerns , Diabetes , Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High - Risk Pregnancy , and Cance r for specific feedback on economic security and its connection to these identified health needs . Sharp 2019 CHNA Suggestions Sharp PFAC suggestions that specifically addressed economic security for more vulnerable patients included: Prioritize the hir ing and training of social workers. Patients are in need of a supportive advocate at the time of discharge. Offer free post -surgery home visits. Make follow -up phone calls to see if patients who have been discharged are doing well and getting proper follow -up care. Make in -home care more accessible, particularly for older patients. Sharp Case Management Leadership suggestions that specifically address economic security included: Ensure 2 -1-1 CIE29 access for all Sharp facilities. Establish more patient -centered initiatives. House a program onsite at hospitals that helps place people in housing, gets them referrals/helps with applications to affordable housing. Sharp Insight Community survey participants also had the opportunity to provide specific suggestions about what Sharp can do to improve the health and well -being of the community. See Appendix R for the most commonly suggested themes. Feedback related to economic security included: Provide transportation for citizens who cannot drive and cannot afford other means. Make sure patients are aware of the rides available to Sharp facilities if they don't have their own transportation. Continue support for food insecurity. Heighten access for low income or limited insurance community members; offer clinics or outreach health care for those without insurance or money to pay; Lower insurance premiums and co -pays; make lower cost health in surance available to per d iem employees; lower prices and provide a \"menu\" of services with prices for people with or without insurance.

Findings Education was identified as a priority health need in both the S MH and HASD&IC 2019 CHNA secondary data analyses and community engagement processes. Secondary Data Findings Educational attainment, limited English proficiency, linguistic isolation, and poverty have profound implications for population health. These data elements were analyzed as indicators of the level of education within SDC. Educational Attainment Within SDC , almost 13.3% of the total population ages 25 and older (292,200) have no high school diploma (or equivalency) based on 2013 -2017 ACS data. An assessment of educational attainment by San Diego regions showed that the percentage of adults who had less than a high school diploma was highest in the s outh (21.9%) and central regions (19.9%) and lowest in the north i nland region (13.0%). As of 2013 -2017, the SDC high school graduation rate (86.7%) was below the Healthy People 2020 ( HP2020 ) benchmark goal of 87.0%. Graduation rates varied by racial and ethnic groups; non - Hispanic , \"other\" r ace (64.0%) and Hispanic/Latinos (67.6%) had the lowest proportion of graduates compared to non -Hispanic Whites (95.8%) which had the highest. Of children age s 3-4, the 2013 -2017 ACS found that 51.0% were enrolled in school. Limited English Proficiency and Linguistically Isolated Populations Given SDC's large immigrant and refugee population, the indicators of limited English profici ency and linguistic isolation are especially important to understanding health in the community. According to the ACS, approximately 14.5% of San Diego residents ages 5 and older speak a language other than English at home and speak English less than \"very well.\" In addition, 6.8% of the population ages 5 and older live in a home in which no person age 14 or older speaks only English, or speaks a non -English language but does not speak English \"very well.\" Similar to those with limited English proficiency, linguistically isolated populations may struggle with accessing health services, communicating with health care providers, and understanding health information.

Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants discussed four topics related to education and its impact on health and well -being: The underlying reasons that some youth in San Diego do not attain educational success The impact that low levels of educational achieve ment have on the health and well-being of San Diegans The barriers to care created by a lack of health literacy The need for continuing education beyond traditional academics Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups Education was identified as having a significant impact on health outcomes and well - being consistently across all Sharp/ SMH 2019 CHNA focus groups, including: Sharp Diabetes Health Educators , SMBHWN Case Managers & Social Workers, Sharp Case Management Leadership , Sharp Cancer Patient Navigators and Soc ial Worker , Sharp Senior Health Center staff and senior patients/community members , and Sharp PFAC members. Additional details are included in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings below. Please refer to Appendix U for a summary of all Sharp/S MH foc us groups. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 139 Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community Survey Sharp's Insight Community online survey provided greater understanding of education as an SDOH impacting Sharp patients and community members. Among 14 SDOH, survey respondents (n=380) ranked education (access, health literacy, workforce development and mobility) as the seventh mo st important SDOH impacting their community ( see Appendix R). When health conditions and SDOH were combined among all respondents, education ranked as the 14th most important health need among 30 choices. Pleas e refer back to Figure 14 for the final ranking of health conditions and SDOH by Sharp Insight Communit y survey participants. Discussion of Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement contributors cited two primary causes of low educational attainment: family stress and a lack of resources . Participants explained, first, that family s upport for youth education is sometimes unavailable. Parents may not know high schoo l graduation requirements, for example, and l anguage and cultural differences may create communication challenges with school personnel. Some p arents , they said, may be unable to read their child's report card. Another issue focus group members pointed out is that s ome economically strained families may wish for their children to begin working as soon as possible \u2014 preferring for them to find a job after high scho ol rather than attend college. Participants also mentioned that low - income families may have to be more transient, needing to move when rent increases. These moves, they said, can cause instability in children's educational placements, which negatively affects their potential to succeed in school. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participant s mentioned that i nsufficient resources at home and in schools also hinder educational success. These include: Spotty Wi -Fi in neighborhoods Lack of computers in the home Crowded, noisy housing Lack of transportation to school Too few school counselors Large class sizes Lack of school -based family support systems For students who are homeless or insecurely housed, focus group participants stressed that thriving in school is even more challenging. This is in part , they said, because education becomes a lower priority than simply surviving day to day. Focus group contributors believe, however, that t heir success is also impeded by socioemotional Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 140 issues. The stigma attached to being poor and, in particular, to poor hygiene and d irty clothing can make these students feel ashamed , they explained . They may experience bullying, have low social status, and have difficulty forming lasting friendships , which in turn can i mpact the students' mental health and undermine their motivation to attend and succeed in school. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group members relayed that both individual and communit y health are profoundly impacted when their residents are not able to achie ve high levels of e ducational attainment. First , participants explained, employment opportunities for those without college degrees and especially without high school diplomas are in short supply, and wages for the a vailable jobs tend to be low . Educationa l attainment, they pointed out, is directly related to economic security. Participants emphasized that families who are n ot secure live under the constant stress of worry ing about paying rent and having enough food to eat , which then negatively impacts the ir health. Further more, contributors stated, without education, career mobility is \"horizontal,\" and there is little potential fo r promotions and higher wages. Focus groups described scenarios for these San Diegans in which work seems endless and when the possibility of a better life seems impossible, they lose hope . HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group participants also pointed out that a lack of health literacy is a significant barrier to care for some San Diegans. Community members, they said, need further ed ucation about preventive health care \u2014 including immunizations and health screenings \u2014 that is conducted in a manner that is sensitive to the individual's culture. They also need, they emphasized, more information about lifestyle choices that promote healt h, like smoking cessation, nutrition and exercise. Many people, focus group contributors said, need assistance understanding and navigating the health care and insurance systems. They emphasized that, f or people who have received a serious health diagnosis , like cancer, having a health advocate who can explain the diagnosis and potential treatment options is beneficial and enhances patient compliance with care. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA participants also noted community members are seeking educational opportuniti es beyond traditional academics. They want and need health education and parenting classes. For their children, they indicated a need for programs about sexual health, self -esteem, and transitional life skills. They are also seeking enrichment classes \u2014 for themselves and their children \u2014 in the arts and in athletics. Focus group participants emphasized that education needs to be viewed from a broader perspective than traditional academics. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups Sharp PFAC focus group participants cited lack of health education and health literacy as posing a significant barrier to health and well -being. Specifically, l ack of health literacy about preventive care, illness, and disease, were described as barriers to health care. One particular topic emphasized by this group was parent's hesitancy to have their children immunized because of fears about debunked myths such as the Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 141 relationship between vaccines and autism. In addition, Sharp PFAC focus group participants highligh ted that many community members and patients do not understand how to navigate the health care system, particular ly in identifying the appropriate sites of care to meet their health needs. That is, when it is appropriate to seek care from the ED versus an urgent care site. Sharp PFAC focus group participants emphasized that this lack of education poses especially significant challenges for newly immigrated community members. Please refer to Table 21 or Appendix U for a summary of feedback from the Sharp PFAC focus group. In the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group, education was also brought up specifically as a lack of health literacy, and the negative impact this has on maintain ing health and well -being. Health literacy is of particular importance for the patients that Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants work with, as the majority of these community members are managing chronic health conditions such as diab etes, COPD, congestive heart failure, and cancer. Please refer to Table 22 or Appendix U for a summary of feedback from the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group. Education was m entioned throughout the Sharp Diabetes Health Educator, SMBHWN Social Workers & Case Managers, Sharp Cancer Navigators and Social Worker, and Sharp Senior Health Center focus groups as well. Please see the findings for Aging Concerns , Diabetes , Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy , and Cancer for specific feedback and recommendations on education and its connection to these identified health needs. Sharp 2019 CHNA Suggestions To address education, Sharp Case Management Leadership suggested the establishment of more patient -centered initiatives, in which health literacy could be a component. The addition of more social workers, proposed by Sharp PFAC focus group participants, could also assist in this area. Sharp Insight Community survey participants also had the opportunity to provide specific suggestions about what Sharp can do to improve the health and well -being of the community. See Appendix R for the most commonly suggested themes. Feedback related to education included: Partner with schools to start health education early. Increase educational/informational awareness by partnering with public school systems' adult programs. Put education facilities in the impoverished communities. Provide a mobile bus for education and screenings. Offer classes for how to file for Medicare, Medicaid and how to choose what plans are right for your family. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 142 Remind patients of programs during routine visits if relevant; provide fliers in doctors' offic es; make a video about health and well -being and play it in waiting rooms. Provide opportunities for technical education on many areas of medicine. Additional recommendations from the Sharp Insight Community survey can be found in Appendix R. Homelessness and Housing Instability Definition Homelessness is when a person does not have a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. Housing problems include a lack of full kitchen or plu mbing facilities, a household comprised of more than one person per room, or a housing cost burden of more than 30% of the household income. Severe housing problems include a lack of full kitchen or plumbing facilities, severe overcrowding, or a housing co st burden of more than 50% of the household income. According to the American Hospital Association, housing instability is an umbrella term for the continuum between homelessness and a completely stable, secure housing situation. Housing instability takes many forms: physical conditions like poor sanitation, heating and cooling; compromised structural integrity; exposure to allergens or pests; homelessness; and unstable access to housing or severe rent burden. Findings Homelessness and housing instability includes the impact of homelessness and housing on community health: Homelessness seriously impacts health in both direct and indirect ways, such as exposure to infectious disease, difficulty managing chronic diseases, and maintaining wound ca re. Poor housing conditions have a direct, negative impact on physical and mental health. The cost of housing affects health because it is the primary driver of economic insecurity in San Diego . Several subsets of the San Diego population are particularly vulnerable to homelessness and housing problems . Homelessness and housing instability was identified as a priority health need by the SMH and HASD&IC 2019 CHNAs in the secondary data analyses and in the community engagement process. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 143 Secondary Data Findings On a given night in San Diego in 2018, 8,576 individuals were homeless; the number of homeless decreased by 6% between 2017 -2018 and 3.4% since 2013. Among the 3,586 (41.8%) were sheltered, and 4,990 (58.2%) were unsheltered. Of those w ho were unsheltered, 50% slept on the street/sidewalk; 18 .0% slept in a vehicle; 14.0% slept in a park; 5 .0% slept in a hand -built structure or tent. Nearly a half (43 .0%) of homeless people had a chronic health condition. From 2011 -2015, in San Diego, 42 .7% of households were cost burdened, spending more than 30% of their income on housing, while 20.0% were severely cost burdened, spending more than half of their income on housing. The lowest -income families had the highest rates of severely cost burdened housing \u2014 47.4% of families with incomes 30.0% or less of the median family income in the county were severely cost burdened. Approximately 46.0% of San Diegans had housing problems, and 25.2% of San Diegans had severe housing problems. Please see Appendix O for Homelessness and Housing Instability definition and secondary source information. Community Engagement Findings HASDIC 2019 CHNA In the HASDIC 2019 CHNA online community engagement survey, homelessness was identified as the fifth most impactful condition on the health and well -being of San Diego residents, and housing was ranked the sixth most impactful condition. HASDIC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants made four main points about the impact of homelessness and housing on community health: Homelessness seriously impacts health in both direct and indirect ways. Poor housing conditions have a direct, negative impact on physical and mental health. The cost of housing affects health because it is the primary driver of economic insecurity in San Diego. Several subsets of the San Diego population are particularly vulnerable to homelessness and housing problems. For a summary of community engageme nt findings related to homelessness and housing instability , see Table 34. Additional details are included in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings section below. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 144 Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups Homelessness and hou sing instability was identified as having a significant impact on health outcomes and well -being consistently across all Sharp/ SMH 2019 CHNA focus groups, including: Sharp Case Management Leadership, Sharp Cancer Patient Navigators and Social Worker , Sharp Senior Health Center staff and senior patients/community members and Sharp PFAC members . Please refer to Appendix U for a summary of all Sharp /SMH focus groups. Additional details are included in the Discus sion of Community Engagement Findings below. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community Sharp's Insight Community online survey provided greater understanding of homelessness and housing instability as an SDOH impacting Sharp patients and community membe rs. Among 14 SDOH, survey respondents (n=380) ranked homelessness (overcrowding, substandard conditions , housing affordability) as the fifth most important SDOH impacting their community (see Appendix R). When health conditions and SDOH were combined among all respondents, homelessness ranked as the 11th most important health need among 30 choices. Please refer back to Figure 14 for the final ranking of health conditions and SDOH by Sharp Insight Community survey participants. Discussion of Community Engagement Findings HASDIC 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups and KI Interviews HASDIC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants argued that being homeless directly impacts health by increasing exposure to infectious disease, particularly Hepatitis A, and to contagious illnesses. In addition, homeless individuals are exposed to extreme weather condit ions, which contributes to poor health. Participants also explained that managing chronic diseases, like diabetes, without a place to store medications is impossible, and without the ability to maintain hygiene, so is effective wound care. In addition, the y suggested that those homeless individuals who have prescription medications become targets of street violence. Care after discharge from the hospital is particularly challenging for the homeless, they argued, since they have no safe place to recover. Hom elessness also indirectly affects health through it s influence on access to care, since h omeless individuals face challenges in transportation and in making and keeping medical appointments. In addition, homeless people face stigma in the health care commu nity, participants said, which can make them hesitant to seek care when they need it. HASDIC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants also noted that health is negatively impacted for those who worry about maintaining their housing . This is in part, they explained, because paying rent becomes their primary focus; attending to their own Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 145 health, and the health of their families, is a lower priority than keeping a roof over their heads. Participants also argued that stress and anxiety about housing contribute to both physical and mental health issues. Housing conditions, they claimed, also affect health. Crowded housing, for instance, was presented as contributing to the spread of illness, and environmental hazards, such as the presence of lead paint, cockroaches and other pests, are believed to exacerbate conditions like asthma. HASDIC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants contended that housing costs are the primary driver of economic insecurity in SDC and described lower -income residents as a population that lives \"on the edge of homelessness.\" Increases in rent outpace increases in pay, they explained, creating a scenario in which many people cannot achieve stability, no matter how hard they work. In addition, community residen ts suggested that affordable housing is scare, and housing assistance programs like Section 8 have long waiting lists. These costs, then, render people economically insecure, which impacts their heath in numerous ways. Community residents participating in the HASDIC 2019 CHNA focus groups expressed particular concern related to housing and homelessness for three groups: transitional age youth, seniors and immigrants. Focus group participants highlighted how transitional age youth (youth who have recently reached legal adulthood of 18 years old), are not allowed in \"family\" homeless shelters; parents, then, must decide whether to let their young adult children fend for themselves on the street or risk the entire family's safety by leaving the shelter. Focus group contributors also asserted that young adults who are desperate for places to stay may make poor decisions that jeopardize their safety and well -being \u2014 trading their bodies, for instance, for a place to sleep, or using drugs to stay warm. Former fos ter youth were described as being particularly vulnerable. In addition, community engagement contributors said that homeless youth who are younger than 18 years old and living apart from their parents often do not know how to obtain needed health care. When they try to get health care services parental consent is usually needed, so they are turned away. Regarding seniors, focus group participants suggested that older community members are in particular need of assistance with locating and utilizing housin g resources, with applications for senior housing, and with managing landlord -tenant relationships. Lastly, community engagement participants argued that immigrants, particularly those who do not have documentation, are at the mercy of their landlords; fea r of deportation keeps them from complaining about substandard housing conditions and rent increases. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups Sharp PFAC focus group participants cited housing specifically as an SDOH that poses a significant barrier to health and health care. The cost of housing was identified as a primary factor underlying economic stress, and cheaper, substandard housing was Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 146 noted to contribute to poor health. Please refer to Table 21 or Appendix U for a summary of feedback from the Sharp PFAC focus group. In addition, Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants identified housing instability as a primary factor impacting community hea lth, particularly the lack of housing available in the community. Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants also highlighted that housing costs and concerns keep people from getting care. \"Their main concern,\" one focus group participant no ted, \"is having a home to live in rather than managing their own care....so there is a tendency to delay receiving health care until an emergency situation arises.\" Please refer to Table 22 or Appendix U for a summary of feedback from the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group. Housing was mentioned frequently throughout the Sharp Cancer Navigators and Social Worker and Sharp Senior Health Center focus groups as well. Please see th e findings for Aging Concerns and Cancer for specific feedback on homelessness and housing instability and its connection to these identified health needs . Sharp 2019 CHNA Suggestions Sharp Case Management Leadership suggestions that could potentially help address challenges with homelessness and housing instability include: Ensure 2 -1-1 CIE30 access for all Sharp facilities. Establish more patient -centered initiatives. House a progra m onsite at hospitals that helps place people in housing and gets them referrals/helps with applications to affordable housing. Establish a more streamlined process and a communication system between the hospitals and the County about those who qualify fo r wraparound services, such as Whole Person Wellness. The addition of more social workers, proposed by Sharp PFAC focus group participants, could also assist in this area. Sharp Insight Community survey participants also had the opportunity to provide specific suggestions about what Sharp can do to improve the health and well -being of the community. See Appendix R for the most commonly suggested themes. Feedback related to homelessness and housing instability included: Offer clinics that serve homeless and uninsured individuals. Put education facilities in the impoverished communities. 30 2-1-1 San Diego's Community Information Exchange (CIE) is an ecosystem comprised of multidisciplinary network partners that use a shared language, a resource database, and an integrated technology platform to deliver enhanced community care planning . Care planning tools en able partners to integrate data from multiple sources and make bi -directional referrals to create a shared longitudinal record. Source : https://ciesandiego.org/what -is-cie/ Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 147 Create discounted programs for immigrants, the poor or underemployed, and the homeless. Provide more community events in high -risk areas. Additional recommendations from the Sharp Insight Community survey can be found in Appendix R.

This care can begin even before pregnancy with a preconception care visit to a health care provider.32 A high -risk pregnancy is one that threatens the health or life of the mother or her fetus. High-risk pregnancy may result from a medical condition present before pregnancy or a medical condition that develops during pregnancy for either mom or baby and causes the pregnancy to become high risk. A high -risk pregnancy can pose problems before, during or after delivery and may require s pecial monitoring throughout the pregnancy.33 Risk factors for high -risk pregnancy include: advanced maternal age \u2014 there is an increased risk for mothers age 35 years and older; lifestyle choices such as smoking, alcohol consumption or the use of illegal drugs; medical history including prior high -risk pregnancies or deliveries, fetal genetic conditions or family history of genetic conditions; underlying condi tions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and epilepsy; and multiple pregnancies.34 Findings Maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, was identified as a priority health need in both the S MH 2019 CHNA community engagement acti vities and secondary data analysis. Secondary Data Findings According to the CDC, in the U.S. , the number of births decreased 2 % (to 3.85 million) from 2016 -2017, continuing the downward trend that is now at the lowest number of births in 30 years. This trend held true across all major racial /ethnic groups. The 2017 national general fertility rate and total fertility rate are both down 3.0% from 2016 \u2014 the largest single -year drop since 2000.35 The teenage birth rate reached a record low in 2017, droppi ng to 18.8 births per 1,000 women.

Notable findings from an analysis of S MBHWN discharge data include36: In 2017, women identified as Hispanic or Latino represented 33.8% of all inpatient discharges at SMBHWN, but 36.9% of inpatient discharges with a gestational diabetes diagnosis. Among women admitted to SMBHWN in 2017 with a high -risk pregnancy, the top three diagnoses were classified as pregnancy in a mother over the age of 35 (80.0%), pregnancy resulting from assistive reproductive technology (8.4%), and pregnancy with insufficient prenatal care (4.8%). In 2017, women identified as Other Race represented 3 5.5% of all inpatient discharges, but 39.6% of preterm labor discharges. In 2017, women identified as Hispanic or Latino represented 33.8% of all inpatient discharges at SMBHWN, but 38.9% of inpatient discharges related to preterm labor.37 Babies identifi ed as Other Race represented 35.4% of all inpatient discharges for infants (under one year) at SMBHWN in 2017, but 40.3% of low birth weight discharges. 36 Source: California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) Non -Public Inpatient Discharge and Emergency Department Encounter Data, 2017.

Patients self - identify their race as one of the following: American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawai ian or Other Pacific Islander; White; or Other Race. The eth nicity category is used to determine whether a patient is of Hispanic origin, and an individual identified as Hispanic may be of any race (OSHPD 2019; U.S. Census Bureau, 2018). Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 151 Babies identified as Hispanic or Latino represented 33.5% of all inpatient discharges for infants (under one year) at SMBHWN in 2017, but 37.9% of low birth weight discharges.38 Babies identified as Other Race represented 35.4% of all inpatient discharges for infants (under one year) at SMBHWN in 2017, but 40.7 % of discharges related to prematurity. In 2017, babies identified as not Hispanic or Latino represented 33.5% of all inpatient discharges for infants (under one year) at SMBHWN, but 38.7% of discharges related to prematurity.38 In 2017, 38.7% of inpatie nt discharges related to prematurity at SMBHWN were paid for by Medi -Cal. Community Engagement Findings Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Group and KI Interview For S MH's 2019 CHNA, a focus group was conducted with case managers and social workers from Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns (SMBH WN) \u2014 Sharp's freestanding women's hospital specializing in labor and delivery services, high - risk pregnancy, obstetrics, gynecology, gynecologic oncology and neonatal intensive care. This SMBHWN Case Manager a nd Social Worker focus group was held to better understand the identified health need of maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, for Sharp patients and community members. Table 28 summarizes the findings of th is focus group. Further details are covered in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings section below. For a description of focus group participants, see Section 3: Methodology . In addition, a KI interview w as conducted with a Nurse Educator from SMBHWN's Perinatal Special Care Unit (PSCU) to dive deeper into this identified need, as well as to develop a case study around maternal and prenatal care. Further details are covered in the Discussion of Community E ngagement Findings section below. Please refer to Appendix J for the case study. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community In addition, the online survey that was sent to participants in Sharp's Insight Community provided greater understanding of prenatal and maternal care (including high -risk pregnancy) as identified health needs among Sharp patients and community members. 38 In OSHPD's inpatient hospital discharge and ED datasets, patient race and et hnicity are two distinct characteristics. Patients self - identify their race as one of the following: American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawai ian or Other Pacific Islander; White; or Other Race. The ethnicity category is used to determine whether a patient is of Hispanic origin, and an individual identified as Hispanic may be of any race (OSHPD 2019; U.S. Census Bureau, 2018). Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 152 Among 16 health conditions, respondents (n=380) ranked maternal/infant health as t he 10th most important health condition impacting their community. Among 14 SDOH, respondents ranked prenatal and maternal care (breastfeeding, post -partum support) as the 13th most important SDOH impacting their community. See Appendix R. Further, respondents in the $100,000 to $149,000 income range were significantly less likely than the sample as a whole to select prenatal and maternal care as one of the five most important SDOH. When health conditions and SDO H were combined among all respondents, maternal/infant health ranked as the 23rd most important health need, and prenatal and maternal care ranked as the 25th most important health need, among a total of 30 choices. Please refer back to Figure 14 for the final ranking of health conditions and SDOH by Sharp Insight Community survey participants. Discussion of Community Engagement Findings Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Group and KI Interview The SMBHWN Case Manager and Social Worker focus group, and PSCU Nurse Educator KI interview focused on the conditions affecting Sharp maternal and prenatal care patients, the obstacles they face to receiving care, the services provided at Sharp, and suggestions for ways in which patient health an d access to care could be improved. Several health conditions were listed as negatively impacting Sharp maternal and prenatal care patients, including: diabetes; preterm pregnancies; short interval pregnancies; substance use; depression, an xiety, and other mood disorders. SDOH impacting patients were noted to be: lack of access to mental health services, even for those patients with insurance; lack of access to transportation; and economic stress related to childcare and maternity leave. In addition, SMBHWN Case Manager and Social Worker focus group participants and the PSCU Nurse Educator KI interviewee outlined a number of obstacles to care for maternal and prenatal care patients. Finances were discussed as a primary barrier to care, parti cularly related to receiving appropriate follow -up care after hospital discharge. Parents have difficulty obtaining and paying for childcare and transportation, and they worry about losing their jobs if they prioritize their newborn's needs over work. In addition, focus group participants said, women often do not understand the nuances of health care leave and disability rights. SMBHWN Case Manager and Social Worker focus group participants also cited fears related to immigration as obstacles keeping peop le from applying for Medi -Cal; some patients believe that their contact information will be registered somewhere and are afraid that they will be turned in to authorities. Focus group participants reported that some immigrants are, in fact, afraid to give any contact information. Participants shared that, sometimes, asylum seekers from Africa will not seek services because they feel Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 153 they cannot talk about their faith or about the country they come from because of discrimination against Muslims. Further, SMBHWN Case Manager and Social Worker focus group participants noted that an inadequate supply of health care providers, particularly mental health providers, posed a significant obstacle to care, as does the unavailability of home health services. Sharp 2 019 CHNA Suggestions for Maternal an d Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy Both the SMBHWN Case Manager and Social Worker focus group participants, and the PSCU Nurse Educator KI interviewee suggested several strategies to improve women's health, including: Build awareness about the importance of preconception and prenatal care. Establish more options for home health care, particularly for postpartum women. Increase lactation consulting and services. Increase availability of translation services. Hire more providers who are linguistically and culturally compatible with the patients. Have nurses, lactation consultants, dietit ians, social workers and interpreters engage with patients as one team so that all needs can be discussed at once. Provide in patient and outpatient mental health services including freestanding women's hospital support groups. Improve communication between physicians and pharmacists so that, for instance, a generic medication can be given in place of a brand name. Sharp Insight Community survey participants also had the opportunity to provide specific suggestions about what Sharp can do to improve the health and well -being of the community. See Appendix R for the most comm only suggested themes. Feedback related to maternal/infant health and prenatal and maternal care included: Offer fun preventative care opportunities (i.e., outdoor activities with information on diet and its effect on health, or mother/mother -to-be inform ational events with a socializing component). Provide prenatal care and delivery to mothers who cannot afford it. Advocate for improved access for the underserved, such as insurance coverage, particularly to stigmatized services like behavioral health an d sexual health. Additional recommendations from the Sharp Insight Community survey can be found in Appendix R.

Economic security: lack of affordable postpartum child care. Economic security continued o New mothers may sign out of hospital against medical advice because they cannot afford childcare and need to return to work to pay bills. o Many mothers spend their entire maternity leave in the hospital with their premature baby. Education needed on postpa rtum anxiety and mood disorders. Transportation : lack of access to transportation . YOUTH ROLES IN FAMILY CARE High school aged siblings typically take over a babysitting role, which can cause them to miss school. Children translate for parents. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS Education: lack of health education such as patients and their families not being aware of preventive medicine. Services: not enough health -related programs and not enough providers. o Access to home care programs is difficult. Providers: lack of mental health providers across all payer sources. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS Transportation issues : hard to keep appointments if you do not have reliable transportation.

Have nursing, lactation consultants, dieticians, social workers, and interpreters come in as one team for each patient so that all needs are met. Maternal mental health services - inpatient and outpatient. Support groups: freestanding women hospital support groups. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 155 Improving communication between doctors and pharmacists - making sure that for certain medications, doctors indicate a substitute can be given in place of a brand name. IMMIGRATION Have you observed any changes over the past year in patient/community member attitude towards immigration issues? Fear and Stigma have increased: Immigrant's fear of applying for Medi -Cal has multiplied; some fear their contact information will be registered. Fearful of public charge rule and of being turned into the authorities. Asylum Seekers from Africa who are Muslim are scared to seek services because of the stigma to their faith and country of origin. People feel emboldened by the current administration to act out. o Providers often make assumptions and racist remarks before looking at the patient's fact sheet. Unintentional Injury and Violence Definition Per HP2020, \"unintentional injuries and violence -related injuries can be caused by a number of events, such as motor vehicle crashes and physi cal assault, and can occur virtually anywhere.\" Unintentional injuries include motor vehicle accidents, falls, firearms, fire/flame, drowning, poisoning, machinery and suffocation. Findings Unintentional injury and violence are described as three issues: Exposure to violence is traumatic and impacts mental health . Neighborhood safety impacts residents' ability to maintain health . Certain groups have increased risk of being exposed to or victims of violence . Unintentional injury and violence was identified as a priority health need by the SM H and HASD&IC 2019 CHNAs in both the secondary data analysis and the community engagement process. Secondary Data Findings Data were reviewed related to several aspects o f unintentional injury and violence in SDC: falls; motor vehicle injuries; and overall crime rate. Falls Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 156 The rate of ED visits caused by falls increased by 1.9% from 2014 -2016. In that same time period , death rates decreased by 8.4% ( see Figure 37). Falls disproportionally affect those over 65 years of age; please see the Aging Concerns section for a breakdown of falls by age groups. Figure 37: Age -Adjusted ED Visit and Mortality Rates for Falls in SDC , 2014 -2016 Source: County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency Public Health Services, Regional & Community Data Motor Vehicle Injuries SDC data shows that from 2014 -2016, age -adjusted ED visit rates for motor vehicle injuries increase by 9.3%, while deaths due to motor vehicle injuries increased 1.08%.

Notable findings relat ed to unintentional injury in SM H's discharge data In 2017, 64.1% of inpatient injury discharges at SMH were due to a fall, 17.8% were due to motor vehicle traffic (MVT), and 9.4% were due to natural/environmental causes.40 In 2017, 39.5% of injury -related visits to the ED at SMH were due to falls, while 20.4% were due to natural/environmen tal causes and 18.8% were due to MVT. Among individuals admitted to SMH with an unintentional injury in 2017, 54.1% were ages 65 and older, and 24.7% were ages 45 -64. 39 Source: California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) Non -Public I npatient Discharge and Emergency Department Encounter Data, 2017.

In 2017, 46.0% of inpatient discharges for injury among individuals ages 18 -44 were due to MVT, while 25.4% were due to a fall and 11.5% were due to natural/environmental causes. In 2017, 25.2% of inju ry-related visits to SMH 's ED by individuals ages 18 -44 were due to MVT, while 24.7% were due to natural/environmental causes and 21.6% were due to a fall. Among individuals ages 65 and older who visited the ED at SMH with an injury in 2017, 75.3% of injuries were due to a fall, and 10.9% of injuries were due to natural/environmental causes. Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Within the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA online survey, of those who chose safety and violence as the greatest influence on poor health outcomes, 55 .0% believed that safety and violence is getting worse in SDC. Additional feedback from the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus groups is included in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings section below. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups Safety and violence was identified as having a significant impact on health and well - being specifically within the Sharp Diabetes Health Educators and Sharp PFAC focus group s. Please refer to Appendix U for a summary of findings from both of these focus groups . Further detail is included in the Discussion of Community Engagement Findings below. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Sharp Insight Community Sharp's Insight Community online survey provided greater understanding of unintentional injury and violence as an SDOH impacting Sharp patients and community members. Among 14 SDOH, survey respondents (n=380) ranked safety and violence (including community violence, domestic violence, child or elder abuse ) as the 12th most important SDOH impacting their community (see Appendix R). When health conditions and SDOH were combined among all respondents, safety and violence ranked as the 20th most important health need among 30 choices. Please refer Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 159 back to Figure 14 for the final ranking of health conditions and SDOH by Sharp Insight Community survey participants. Discussion of Community Engagement Findings HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups HASD& IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants emphasized that people who are a victim of or witness to violence may experience trauma as a result. This trauma can lead to PTSD and to other mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. These condit ions, in turn, they said, may make people less able to seek out and receive the care they need. They asserted, f urthermore, that mental health care is extremely difficult to access even when a person is not struggling with the after effects of trauma. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA focus group members also discussed the importance of a safe environment for good health. Residents need to feel safe outside in order to play and exercise, and when they do not, contributors said, they are far more likely to be sedentary. P hysical inactivity, they asserted, lends to poor health and is a risk factor for obesity, which is then a risk factor for chronic conditions like diabetes and CVD . They explained that a safe and pleasant neighborhood also contributes to reducing anxiety and stress. In addition, HASD& IC 2019 CHNA focus group participants talked about two groups who have increased risk of exposure to violence. Homeless individuals were discussed as frequent targets of violence. Health care providers identified injuries from violence as one of the conditions for which they often treat homeless individuals. In addition, the constant stress or worrying about staying safe, contributors stressed, creates severe anxiety among some homeless individuals. Refugees were also noted to be a group who are more likely to have been exposed to violence and to suffer from that exposure. As a result of witnessing violence, participants said, refugees may be hyper vigilant to perceived threats and mistrustful of those who try to help them. Sharp 2019 CHNA - Focus Groups In the Sharp PFAC focus group, safety and violence was brought up specifically in connection to sex trafficking and its serious impact on youth. Sharp PFAC focus group participants highlighted how in certain areas, especially in the east region of SDC, sex trafficking affects individuals of all socioeconomic status. Please refer to Table 21 or Appendix U for a summary of feedback from the Sharp PFAC focus group. The Sharp Diabetes Health Educator focus group also stated that instances of domestic violence and familial abuse pose a challenge to accessing care and a barrier for both patients and their family members . Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 160 Section 6 Community Assets, R ecommendations and Next Steps The findings of this CHNA revealed significant priority health needs im pacting communities served by SM H, particularly those communities facing inequities. In addition, the findings provided insight and recommendations from direct conversations with the community. This insight will assist in the design and implementation of SM H programs and services to help improve the health and well -being of the community it serves. To support cross -sector information -sharing about the CH NA-identified health needs for San Diegans, the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Committee worked with IPH to develop health briefs for selected identified health needs . Section 7: Health Briefs provides both quantitative and quali tative data on selected identified health needs and SDOH. These health briefs are intended to both provide educational resources for the community, as well as to support community -based organizations who may utilize this data to pursue funding opportunitie s. Through these health briefs, the CHNA Committee seeks to aid and champion the work of the community -based organizations and social support networks that are critical community assets in San Diego. Community Assets to Respond to Identified Needs Comm unity assets and resources are integral to addressing the full spectrum of health needs that exist in the population. For purposes of this report, available community assets and resources to address the top health needs are separated into two categories: Programmatic and/or organizational resources Health initiatives and public policy The County of San Diego has many assets and resources addressing the health needs identified in this assessment including: community -based organizations; government departm ents and agencies; hospital and clinic partners; and community members. The HASD&IC and Sharp 2019 CHNAs relied on and utilized the 2 -1-1 San Diego database as its comprehensive resource for community assets in San Diego. Details are provided below. 2-1-1 San Diego 2-1-1 San Diego is an important community resource and information hub. Through its 24/7 phone service and online database, it helps connect individuals with community, health, and disaster services. Recognizing that available programs and se rvices are Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 161 continuously changing, we encourage the community to access the most available data through 2 -1-1 San Diego. For more specific information about the programs within each category, please contact 2 -1-1 San Diego or visit their website (http://www.211sandiego.org/ ). Data were pulled by searching the 2 -1-1 San Diego taxonomy using relevant search terms for each condition/need. The number of resources/services that were located for each condition were as follows: Aging Concerns: 91 Access to Care: 260 Behavioral Health: 703 Cancer: 129 Cardiovascular Disease: 161 Diabetes: 144 Maternal and Prenatal Care: 251 Obesity: 298 Social Determinants of Health: 5,836 Please note, this is an assessment of the type and number of services available as of June 17, 2019, but it is not an exhaustive list of resources available in SDC. Due to the interconnectedness of chronic conditions, organizations, programs and services m ay be repeated if they provide more than one service and if they are located in more than one location. For more specific information about the programs within each category, please contact 2 -1-1 San Diego or visit their website at: http://www.211sandiego.org . Sharp CHNA Community Guide As part of Sharp's 2016 CHNA Phase 2 process, a Sharp CHNA Community Guide was developed and made publicly available on Sharp.com at: https://www.sharp.com/about/community/community -benefits/health -needs - assessments.cfm . The Guide was developed to provide community mem bers with a more user -friendly resource to learn about Sharp's CHNA process and findings, as well as the identified health and social needs addressed in Sharp's programs. In addition, the Sharp CHNA Community Guide provides a direct link for community memb ers to provide feedback on Sharp's CHNA process. Please refer to Appendix E for the Sharp CHNA Community Guide. An updated Sharp CHNA Community Guide will be publicly available on sharp.com during early - to mid - 2020. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA: Community Recommendations HASDIC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants identified three means by which the identified health needs could be better addressed: 1. The implementation of overarching strategies to address the h ealth needs 2. The development or expansion of resources to meet the needs Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 162 3. The creation of systemic, policy and environmental changes to better support health outcomes All of these approaches, participants emphasized, would require collaboration between political, health care system, and community leaders, health care professionals, community organizations, and residents. Please refer to Figure 40, the Resource & Opportunities to Address Priority Health Needs graphic below for a s ummary of these approaches. Strategies to improve / enhance knowledge, patient experience, and collaboration Community knowledge Community residents of all ages and backgrounds need a better understanding of how to maintain good health and prevent illness and disease. Culturally competent and linguistically appropriate educational campaigns should be developed that target groups experiencing health disparities. Educational campaigns should: Promote available services in the community, clinics, and hospitals Address potential barriers to care, including: o how to apply for health insurance and/or public benefits o how to access transp ortation o whether translation and navigations services are available o and any potential impact on immigration status Market services to address SDOH , such as: o affordable housing o resources to target food insecurity Patient experience The patient experi ence would be improved by a more diverse hospital workforce with knowledge of the specific needs of racial/ethnic and sexual minorities. Navigating the health care system for people whose first language is not English or who have recently immigrated, for e xample, presents overwhelming challenges. In addition, coordinating care between health care providers and with social service organizations is crucial to improving the patient experience. Efforts should be made to: Provide more health navigators and cas e managers who speak the patient's language and understand the patient's culture Coordinate care between health care providers and across clinics Provide continuity of care with warm hand -offs between health care systems and social service organizations Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 163 Collaboration Enhanced collaboration was named as essential to improving health. This includes collaboration between health care professionals \u2014 such as primary care providers and specialists \u2014 and between health care systems and social service organiza tions. Improved collaboration between social workers, law enforcement, and attorneys would also be beneficial. Partnerships with community residents and organizations would improve the efficacy of health care services and develop trust between health care providers and the people they serve. These partnerships should include collaborative advocacy efforts, efforts to adapt programs and interventions to the unique needs of specific groups, and the dissemination of information back to communities collected from research projects in those communities. The development and expansion of specific types of resources Community engagement participants identified several specific types of resources that are necessary to address the priority health needs of the commu nity: Urgent Care services that include expanded hours, availability to all populations, and mental health and substance use services Preven tive care programs that offer services such as immunizations (including the flu vaccine), HIV testing, and exercis e programs Dental services for preventive care and to address oral health issues such as carries and gum disease Onsite programs and mobile units that bring services to the community, including programs in senior housing complexes, school clinics, mobile screening, and mobile food distribution Culturally competent programs for refugees, Native Americans, Latinos, Blacks, African Americans, LGBTQ individuals, non -citizens, and asylum seekers Programs for the youth, especially community centers and programs for young men and for homeless youth Homeless services and discharge support, including mobile showers, more shelters, and further options for post -acute recuperative care Food insecurity navigation that includes reference guides for food system/service navigation of San Diego County, private, and non -profit organizations, and signage for healthy food options for CalFresh/ SNAP users at stores and restaurants Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 164 Systemic change Finally, it was evident from the community engagement findings that San Diega ns think that large -scale system, policy, and environmental changes are necessary to make true progress toward good health for all residents. These changes include: Creating universal and/or affordable health care Increasing the minimum wage Increasing applications for federal funding and allowing more time to prove a return on investment for this funding Enabling easy sharing of information about patients between organizations and hospitals Figure 40 below presents a summary of approaches r ecommended by HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement participants. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 165 Figure 40: HASD&IC 2019 CHNA - Resources & Opportunities Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 166 SMH 2019 CHNA: Community Recommendations Community engagement participants throughout the S MH 2019 CHNA process provided specific suggestions to help address the identified health needs and SDOH in the CHNA. These recommendations were highly aligned with the suggestions outlined in the narrative above and summarized in Figure 40. For specific recommendations from each S MH 2019 CHNA community engagement group, please refer to Section 5: Findings of this report. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA: Hospital Next Steps Hospitals and health systems that participated in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process have varying requirements for next steps. Private, not -for-profit (tax exempt) hospitals and health systems are required to develop hospital or health system community health needs assessment reports and implementation strategy plans to address selected identified health needs. The participating district hospitals and health systems do not have the same CHNA requirements but work very closely with their patient communities to ad dress health needs by providing programs, resources, and opportunities for collaboration with partners. Every participating hospital and health care system will review the CHNA data and findings in accordance with their own patient communities and principa l functions and evaluate opportunities for next steps to address the top identified health needs in their respective patient communities. The CHNA report will be made available as a resource to the broader community to solicit additional feedback on findi ngs and may serve as a useful resource to both residents and health care providers to further community -wide health improvement efforts. The CHNA Committee is in the process of planning Phase 2 of the 2019 CHNA, which will include gathering community fee dback on the 2019 CHNA process and strengthening partnerships around the identified health needs and SDOH. This will include an exploration to deepen the understanding of stigma's impact on SDOH and health needs, as well as how hospitals and health systems could better address stigma in patient care. The complete summary of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA is available online at: https://hasdic.org/2019 -chna/ . Paper copies or electronic files are also available upon reque st, as well as items provided in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA developed by the Institute for Public Health ( IPH) at San Diego State University . Please contact Lindsey Wade at the HASD&IC with any questions. Lindsey Wade Vice President, Public Policy Hospital Association of San Diego & Imperial Counties 5575 Ruffin Road, Ste 225 San Diego, CA 92123 P: 858.614.1553 lwade@hasdic.org Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 167 SMH 2019 CHNA: Next Steps SMH has developed its FY 2020 - FY 2023 Implementation Strat egy to address the needs identified through the 2019 CHNA process for the primary communities it serves. In addition, the S MH 2019 CHNA Planning Team, in addition to Sharp leadership, Sharp Community Benefit, service line leaders, and other team members ar e committed to an ongoing exploration of partnerships and collaborations that help address the needs of SMH's community members. Tools such as the asset map of currently existing resources within SDC, as well as the CNI data, will be utilized to help con tinue to identify gaps in community resources and provide insight into further program development. The S MH FY 2020 - FY 2023 Implementation Strategy is available on sharp.com at: http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . In addition, the implementation strategy is submitted along with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS) Form 990, Schedule H. The IRS Form 990, Schedule H will also be publicly availabl e on Guidestar ( http://www.guidestar.org/ ) in the coming months. Sharp will continue to work with HASD&IC and IPH as part of the CHNA Committee to develop and implement Phase 2 of the 2019 CHNA. Phase 2 will focus on continued engagement of community partners to analyze and improve the CHNA process, as well as the hospital implementation strategies that address the 2019 CHNA findings. Thus, the CHNA process will evolve to meet the needs of our community members, an d support the work of our community partners who also address those identified needs. In addition, in the first year of Sharp's FY 2020 - FY 2023 Implementation Strategy, Sharp hospitals (including S MH), medical groups, and health plans are embarking on a new, innovative partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego's Community Information Exchange (CIE). The CIE includes a l ongitudinal client record with community member history, access to and utilization of social programs (e.g., housing, food b anks, community clinics, etc.), emergency transport data, and much more. The CIE also includes a direct - referral feature, which allows for documented, bi -directional, close d-loop referrals between all CIE partners \u2014 including hospitals, clinics, and social service programs. Currently, there are more than 60 community partners (organizations) participating in CIE, and more than 90,000 community members enrolled, with approximately 4,500 new community members enrolled each month. Sharp is the first integrated health system \u2014 including its hospitals, medical groups and health plan \u2014 to participate in the CIE. By leveraging this technology, and expanding upon this capability for shared data, consistent tracking and robust reporting, the CIE partnership presents an exciting opportuni ty for Sharp to strengthen and evaluate the impact of clinical -community linkages for its patients and community members in need, particularly regarding SDOH. The data collected in this one -year partnership will inform the value case for continuing with th e partnership after the pilot year (Summer 2020). Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 168 Overall, there is broad recognition that all regions of SDC will continue to experience changes that directly affect the health of the communities served by S MH. This uncertainty in the general environment \u2014 including changes at the local, state and federal levels of government, as well as transformation of the health care market landscape \u2014 continues to be a serious issue and key consideration for the health care community. While this CHNA provides a high -level view of health in the communities served by S MH, hospital leaders are mindful of the need to be responsive to those emerging trends and needs in health care that shape the health and well -being of our community. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 169 Section 7 Health Briefs: Select Identified Community Health Needs and SDOH To support cross -sector information -sharing about the CHNA -identified health needs for San Diegans, the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Committee worked with IPH to develop health briefs for selected identified health needs. This section includes those health briefs, which provide both quantitative and qualitative data on the selected identified health needs and SDOH. The health briefs are intended to both provide educational resources for the community, as well as to support community -based organizations who may utilize this data to pursue funding opportunities. Through these health b riefs, the CHNA Committee seeks to aid and champion the work of the community -based organizations and social support networks that are critical community assets in San Diego. Access to Health Care 28.5 million people are without health insurance in the U.S.1 Access to high quality, comprehensive care is vital for preserving good health, preventing and managing disease, decreasing disabil ity, averting premature death, and ac hieving health equity for all .2 To access care, people need health insurance coverage and a consistent source of care that provides evidence - based, culturally competent preventive and emergency medical services in a timely manner.2 Uninsured in the U.S.1 (2017 ) 8.8% of people are without health insurance . By Age Seniors and children are the least likely to be uninsured, while a large percentage of working adults have no coverage: People age 65+ have the highest rates of coverage, with only 1.3% uninsured . 5.4% of children under the age of 19 are uninsured (7.8% for children living in poverty ). Working adults ages 26 -34 are more likely to be uninsured than the overall working population (15.6% vs 12.2%) . By Race Uninsured rates are highest for people who i dentify as Hispanic (16.1% ), followed by Black (10.6% ), and Asian (7.3% ). By Educational Attainment The uninsured rate decreases as education level increases . While only 4.3% of people with a graduate or professional degree are uninsured, 26.3% of people without a high school diploma are uninsured. By Income Uninsured rates increase as level of income decreases . The highest uninsured rates are among those who make less than $25,000 annually (13.9%) , and the lowest are among those who make more than $125,00 0 (4.3%) .

The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease.4,5 Approximately 5.7 million people are living with dementia o Alzheimer's disease accounts for about 60 -70% of these cases.6 Dementia is the 3rd leading cause of death in the U.S. when combining all four causes of dementia.*,7 About 262,000 people will die from dementia each year o 46.4% of these deaths result from Alzheimer's disease7 Age -adjusted death rate due to dementia is 66.7 per 100,000.7 Alzheimer's disease is the 5th leading cause of death among those over 65 years in the U.S.8 By Sex More women than men have Alzheimer's disease or other dementias : Among people 65 years and older (65+), 62.5 % of people with Alzheimer's d isease are w omen5 By Race and Ethnicity Blacks and Hispanic individuals are more likely to have Alzheimer's disease or other dementias than Whites.5 Leading causes of death among persons aged 65 and over8 1.

Since the U.S. population is aging, both the number of falls and the cost to treat fall injuries are likely to rise.12 Among people 65 years and older (65+) (2017) Falls are t he leading cause of injury -related mortality , accounting for 55.7% of unintentional fatal injuries in 2017.13 The death rate due to falls was 61.3 per 100,000.10 The nonfatal rate due to falls is 5,841.1 per 100,000 (about 3 million nonfatal fall injuries) .11 By Sex For fatal falls, males who are 65+ are more likely to die than females who are 76+ (75.3 vs 54.8 per 100,000).10 For nonfatal fall-related injuries, females who are 65+ accounted for 64.6%.11 By Race and Ethnicity Non -Hispanic Whites are more im pacted by falls : Non -Hispanic Whites have the highest death rate (70.6 per 100,000), followed by non -Hispanic Native American (49.3 per 100,000)10 Non -Hispanic Whites have the highest number of nonfatal fall injuries (1,648,923)11 FALLS IN SAN DIEGO COUNT Y9(2016) In San Diego, thousands of residents 65 years and older visit an emergency department (ED) for fall -related injuries.

Symptoms of asthma attacks include wheezing, tightness or pain in the chest, shortness of breath, and coughing. The severity of attacks range from mild to life threatening.2 Asthma has significant impact on the daily lives of the people who suffer,2 and in California alone, the 2020 projected medical costs are estimated to be $4.9 billion.3 Asthma in the U.S. (2016) In 2016, 8.3% of Americans currently had asthma4, and 13.6% will be diagnosed with asthma a t some point in their lifetime.5 By Sex Among children, asthma is more common among boys (9.2%) than girls (7.4%), but among adults asthma is more common among women (10.4%) than men (6.2%).4 By Age 8.3% of children younger than 18 years old have asthma, a decrease from 9.4% in 2010. Rates are higher among those 5 -11 years old (9.6%) and 12 -17 years old (10.5%) than amon g children 0 -4 years old (3.8%).4,6 The rate is the same among adults 18+ (8.3%).4 By Race/Ethnicity Puerto Ricans have the highest rates of asthma (14.3%), followed by Non -Hispanic Black (11.6%), Non -Hispanic Whites (8.3%), Other Non -Hispanic (8.0%), and Hispanics (6.6%).4 By Income & Housing Quality Asthma is most prevalent among the lowest economic groups: 11.8% of those whose income is below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) have asthma, compared to 8.9% with incomes 100% to less than 250% of th e FPL and 7.4% of those with incomes 250% to less than 450% of the FPL .4 Poor housing quality is independently associated with asthma diagnoses and higher rates of emergency department (ED) discharges for asthma.7 ASTHMA IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY8 Inpatient Di scharge Rates In 2016, 264.4 people per 100,000 were discharged from an ED for asthma and 38.6 per 100,000 people were discharged from inpatient hospitalizations.

Adults: Reports of poor and fair health11 (201 5) Among adults with asthma, 33.1% report fair or poor health compared to those without asthma (15.9%). In California 29.1% of adults with asthma report fair or poor health compared to 17.0% without asthma . Mortality12 (2016) Approximately 3,500 people di e annually from asthma (10 per 1 million). Adults are more likely to die from asthma than children - the death rate is highest (2 9.2 per million) among those 65 years and older . Non -Hispanic Blacks are two to three times more likely (22.3 per million) to d ie from asthma than people from other races/ethnicities. Deaths from asthma are largely preventable. Risk Factors and Triggers for Asthma Factors that increase the risk of an asthma diagnosis include:13 Parental asthma Prenatal environmental tobacco smoke Premature birth Maternal weight gain or obesity during pregnancy Maternal stress Maternal use of antibiotics or paracetamol Birth by caesarean delivery Severe respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) in infancy Overweight or obesity Indoor exposure to mold or fu ngi Outdoor air pollution Triggers that exacerbate asthma and/or cause attacks include:14 Tobacco smoke Dust mites Outdoor air pollution Cockroaches and their droppings Pets Mold Smoke from burning wood or grass Certain Illnesses Bad weather HOSPITAL DISC HARGES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY8 Inpatient discharge rates (per 100,000) in San Diego County are highest among Black and Hispanic individuals as well as those who identify as \"Other\".

Not smoking 2. Being physically active 3. Having normal blood pressure 4. Maintaining normal blood glucose levels 5. Having low total cholesterol levels 6. Mainta ining a healthy weight 7. Eating a healthy diet Adults who meet at least six of these criteria reduce their risk of death from CVD by 76% compared to those who meet none.8 Only 8.8% of Americans meet at least six of the se criteria.8 CORONARY HEART DISEASE & STROKE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY9 Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Emergency department ( ED) discharge rates for CHD increased by 35.3% from 2014 -2016.

The three primary types of diabetes are: Type 2 (the most common type), Type 1 , and gestational (occurring during pregnancy). Diabetes has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality1 and has a n economic burden of approximately $245 billion in the United States.2 Diabetes in the U.S. Approximately 9.7% of adults have a diabetes diagnosis.3 (2016 - 2017) Among those with diabetes, 91.2% have type 2 diabetes and 5.6% have type 1 .3 (2016 -2017) 132, 000 youth younger than 18 years old have diabetes.1 (2013 - 2015) Type 2 diabetes is more common among adults 65+, males, those with higher body mass index, Asian -Americans, those with lower family incomes, and lower educational levels.3 (2016 -2017) The age adjusted death rate for diabetes in the U.S. is 21.5 per 100, 000.5 (2016) Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of mortality in the U.S., and the 5th leading cause of death for those 55 -64 years old.4 (2017) The number of adults diagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. has more than tripled in the last 20 years.6 (2017) Risk Factors According to the CDC, the following are risk factors for developing diabetes:1 Being overweight or obese Smoking Having a parent, brother, or sister with diabetes Having high blood pre ssure measuring 140/90 or higher, high cholesterol, and high blood glucose Being physically inactive -exercising fewer than three times a week DIABETES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY 9.4% of adults have diabetes; lower than the state rate of 10.7%7 (2017) Mortality In 2017, diabetes was the 7th leading cause of death in San Diego County.8 The age -adjusted death rate for diabetes was 20.7 per 100,000 population.9 (2016) American Indian and Alaska Natives have the highest diabetes death rate , 63.8 compared to the unad justed county rate of 22.3 per 100,000.9 (2016) Opportunities for Prevention:11 97% of the population lives in close proximity to a park or recreational facility, an indicator of strong \"exercise opportunities\". San Diego receives an 8.3/10 on the \"Food En vironment Index (2015/2016),\" a measure of affordable, close, and nutritious food retailers.

San Diego children (5 -11 years old) have higher rates of at least one hour a day of physical activity , each day of the week (33.6%) than the California average (31.2%). Among adults in San Diego, 20.4% have at least 20 minutes of physical activity each day of the week, similar to the state average of 20.%.

Please provide any additional comments about the results of the CHNA (N=12) 1. \"everything is fine\" 2. It is good to have these statistics.

Nowadays because of our new government, we have the problem of fear in communities to seek and receive medical attention or services offered to the community.

This value is reflected in Sharp's mission to improve the health of those it serves with a commitment to excellence in all that it does. Since 1995, Sharp has participated in a countywide collaborative to conduct a triennial Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in an effort to identify the priority health needs facing the San Diego community. In 2013, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act presented a new requirement for not-for-profit hospitals and health care systems to develop a separate CHNA for each individually licensed hospital. To address these new requirements, in 2013 and 2016, Sharp began its CHNA process by collaborating with other hospitals and health care systems in San Diego County to create a collaborative CHNA \u2014 an effort led by the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) and in contract with the Institute for Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State University. The collaborative CHNA process and findings provided the foundation for the development of CHNAs for each Sharp hospital.Sharp HealthCare Community Health Needs Assessment Guide2016 CHNA Social Determinants of Health (in Rank Order)In 2016, Sharp contracted separately with IPH to develop tailored CHNAs through two phases: Phase 1 Sharp conducted discussions, interviews and surveys to collect feedback from Sharp clinicians and staff, as well as patients and community members served specifically by each of its hospitals. This allowed Sharp to understand the unique needs of those who live throughout its hospitals' communities. Phase 1 findings identified the priority health needs and social determinants of health (factors that contribute to challenges faced by community members in their attempts to maintain health and well-being) highlighted in the figures below. Phase 2 Upon the completion of Phase 1, Sharp distributed follow-up surveys to Sharp patients, community members and health care providers to collect feedback on the CHNA findings and process, including input on the priority health needs and related social determinants of health identified in Phase 1. This feedback helps guide planning for future CHNAs.2016 CHNA Priority Health Needs Findings of the Collaborative CHNA Findings of the Sharp-Specific CHNAs 1.

Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 288 Appendix G Community Need Index Description The Community Need Index Dignity Health and Truven Health jointly developed the nation's first standardized Community Need Index (CNI).44 The CNI identifies the severity of health vulnerability for every ZIP code in the U.S. based on specific barriers to health care access. The CNI provides a score for every populated ZIP code in the U.S. on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0. A score of 1.0 indicates a ZIP code with the least need (dark green in maps), while a score of 5.0 represents a ZIP code with the most need (bright red in maps). For a detailed description of the CNI please vis it the interactive website at: http://cni.chw - interactive.org/ . The five barriers are listed below along with the individual statistics that were analyzed for each barrier. 1. Income Barrier Percentage of households below poverty line, with head of household age 65 or more Percentage of families with children under 18 below poverty line Percentage of single female -headed families with children under 18 below poverty line 2. Cultural Barrier Percentage of the population that is minority (including Hispanic ethnicity) Percentage of the population over age 5 that speaks English poorly or not at all 3. Educational Barrier Percentage of the population over 25 without a high school diploma 4. Insurance Barrier Percentage of the population in the labor force, aged 16 or more, without employment Percentage of the population without health insurance 5. Housing Barrier Percentage of the population renting their home Based on these 5 categories and 9 total criteria, every ZIP code in the U.S. was assigned an index number: Scale of 1 - 5 5 represents the most vulnerable communities; 1 the least vulnerable 44 Dignity Health, Community Need Index. http://cni.chw -interactive.org/Truven%20Health_2015%20Source%20Notes_Community%20Need%20Index.pdf Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 289 Appendix H SMH and SMBHWN Hospital Data SMH Aging Concerns Behavioral Health Cancer Cardiovascular Diabetes Obesity Unintentional Injury SMBHWN Behavioral Health Cancer Cardiovascular Diabetes Obesity Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy Unintentional Injury Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 290 SMH Hospital Data - Aging Concerns Table 1: SMH Aging Concerns - Top 10 Behavioral Health Inpatient ICD -10 Codes, CY 2017 Top 10 ICD -10 Diagnosis Codes ICD-10 Code Frequency Percentage Male Freq.* % Male Female Freq.* % Female Major Depressive Disorder Single Episode Unspecified F32.9 1,171 21.36% 409 7.46% 762 13.90% 743 13.55% 226 4.12% 517 9.43% Unspecified Dementia Without Disturbance F03.90 723 13.19% 273 4.98% 450 8.21% Nicotine F17.210 367 6.69% 178 3.25% 189 3.45% Dementia in Other Diseases Classified Elsewhere Without Behavioral Disturbance F02.80 252 4.60% 93 1.70% 159 2.90% Delirium F05 169 3.08% 70 1.28% 99 1.81% Major Depressive Disorder Recurrent Unspecified F33.9 149 2.72% 43 0.78% 106 1.93% Bipolar Disorder Unspecified F31.9 119 2.17% 40 0.73% 79 1.44% Other Diagnoses In This Identified Health Area -- 1,334 24.33% 690 12.58% 644 11.75% Data .

\"Camila\" Breast Cancer: A Crisis One in Eight Women Will Face Camila is a 55 -year-old, single Latina woman who works as an LVN at a skilled nursing facility. Camila loves her job, and she known for the nurturing and intelligent way she cares for her patients. At home, Camila has a 15 -year-old son, and she also cares for her 75 -year-old mother. They are a close and loving family. Camila is a legal resident of the United States, and her son is a citizen. Her mother, however, is in the country withou t proper documentation. After a recent mammogram at the Sharp Memorial Outpatient Pavilion, an abnormality is found in Camila's right breast. After further imaging, Camila is sent for a biopsy, and she is diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma \u2014 the mos t common type of breast cancer. Camila is referred to a medical oncologist and a breast surgeon. Meeting Camila's Medical Needs Camila's care team is housed at Sharp Memorial Hospital. They formulate a treatment plan for her, which will include: Four months of chemotherapy Surgery (breast conserving, if possible) Radiation therapy five days a week for six weeks Five years of hormone targeted therapy drugs Five years of close surveillance once treatment has ended Clinical staging assessed Camila's breast cancer as Stage IIb. The tumor is initially too large for Camila to be a candidate for breast co nserving surgery. Therefore, Camila undergoes neoadjuvant chemotherapy \u2014 systemic therapy that occurs before surgery. Camila receives the chemotherapy every three weeks for four months. As expected, Camila loses her hair, and while she is able to continue working after the first round of Breast Cancer As of 2016, 3.5 million women in the United States had a history of breast cancer.1 American women have a 1 in 8 (12.4%) chance of developing breast cancer.2 In San Diego from 2011 - 2015, 127 women per 100,000 had breast cancer diagnosis .2 In the same time period, 20.3 per 100,000 women died from breast cancer. Death rates from breast cancer in San Diego vary by race3: 25.7 for Black women 22.1 for White women 18.1 for Hispanic women 12.6 for Asian/Pacific Islander women \"You are never again the person you were before the cancer diagnosis\" - Clinical Social Worker and Patient Navigator Sharp Barnhart Cancer Center Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 344 chemotherapy, after the second, she becomes too sick to work. She also feels as if her brain is foggy \u2014 she can't concentrate well, and she is especially forgetful. Once the chemotherapy has concluded, new imaging scans show that the tumor has adequately shrunk to allow for breast conserving surgery. Camila has the surgery and returns home the same day. Three weeks later, she begins radiation therapy, attending five days a week for six weeks. She is also taking Tamoxifen, a hormone -targeted drug, to lower her risk of recurrence. She will take this medication for at least five years. After her treatment concludes, Camila will have physical examinations every six months for the next three years and a mammogram every six months for the next five years, at which time she will return to annual mammograms. Meeting Camila's Social, Emotional, and Practical Needs Camila is surprised at how deeply this diagnosis has shaken her given her experience in the health care field. She is scared and overwhelmed with worry about her health and about how she will manage her family while she is undergoing treatment. Camila knows that her chances of survival are excellent. Nevertheless , she is scared of dying and can't help but wonder what will happen to her son and to her mother if she dies. Camila knows it isn't the most important thing, but she is also deeply upset about losing her hair. Camila also has a long list of practical con cerns. She isn't sure how the family will make it financially \u2014 the co-pays for her treatment are high, and her disability check will be smaller than her regular income. Her car is old, and the hospital is 15 miles from her home, and she is concerned that her car will break down. She also isn't sure what she will do about getting home from surgery or about driving herself to chemotherapy and radiation if she is sick \u2014 she's the only person in the house who drives. At home, her mom tries to help, but her mot her is not in the best of health and her mobility is limited. Camila does not want her to son to have to take care of her during her chemotherapy and after surgery. She worries about how his needs will be met while she is sick \u2014 how will he get to school a nd to sports and to his friends' houses? And, although she doesn't like to discuss this openly, Camila is worried Community Engagement Findings: Gaps in Services Financial concerns are a primary source of stress for cancer patients. Financial navigators to deal specifically and exclusively with health insurance and other financial issues are needed. Social and support services for cancer patients are fragmented. They would benefit from an in -house \"one-stop\" shop that provide services to meet a variety of needs. Too few therapists who specialize in oncology accept insurance; this leaves those who cannot self -pay without vital long -term mental healt h care. More resources are needed to provide adequate post - surgery or post -chemotherapy follow -up to cancer patients . Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 345 that all of this contact with the health care community might result in her residency status being revoked \u2014 or worse \u2014 her mother's deportation. Fortunately, Camila is referred to a Sharp Memorial Hospital cancer patient navigator. The navigator calls her before she begins chemotherapy and: Administers a distress scale which helps the navigator assess Camila's physical, social, emotional, and practical needs Helps Camila schedule her appointments for surgery Talks to Camila about what to expect during treatment and what side effects might o ccur Offers Camila tips and tools to manage treatment side effects Refers Camila to community resources that can help with transportation Helps Camila apply for a grant that will provide her with financial assistance Refers her to a Sharp social worker who provides Camila with several counseling sessions during her cancer treatment Comes to her bedside before her surgery to reassure her Refers her to twice -monthly support group for women with breast cancer at Sharp Memorial Outpatient Pavilion Encourages h er to attend a \"Lunch and Learn\" education program at Sharp Memorial Outpatient Pavilion to cope with the emotional aspects of cancer Discusses some of the integrative care options available at Sharp Memorial Hospital and whether they would be beneficial to Camila Survivorship: Meeting Camila's Needs After Treatment Ends Seven months after her diagno sis, Camila's cancer treatment comes to a successful end. The cancer has been treated, and Camila recovers quickly. The cancer navigator helps Camila complete a survivorship care plan, which will ensure that Camila is aware of symptoms of recurrence and of potential long-term effects from her treatment. The plan also gives details about the kind of follow -up care Camila should receive. Potential Long -term Side Effects of Breast Cancer Treatment9,10 Anxiety Depression Suicide Neurocognitive dysfunction Sexual dysfunction PTSD Fear of recurrence Poor body image Cardiovascular toxicities Lymphedema Fatigue Pain Bone loss Premature menopause Infertility Skin changes Mood disorders, including depression, are common among cancer patients. Depression, in turn, is associated with higher levels of cancer mortality.4-8 Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 346 Physically, Camila is doing fairly well. Fortunately, she did not develop lymphedema, cardiovascular issues, or neuropath y as some breast cancer patients do. Camila is, however, exhausted and continues to be forgetful and less organized than she was before she had cancer. She also struggles emotionally. She doesn't understand why she isn't happier and is extremely anxious th at the cancer will recur. Her son, too, struggles. He worries about leaving his mom home alone and has taken over some of the care for his grandmother. Camila isn't sure where to turn for help. Her relationship with the cancer patient navigator ended whe n her treatment ended, as did her counseling with the social worker. She knows that support groups are available for breast cancer survivors, but she doesn't have the energy to find one. She is trying to find a therapist, both for her and for her son, but the therapists she locates who have experience in cancer survivorship don't take her insurance. Camila's experience is not uncommon. A key finding of the 2019 CHNA was that cancer survivors need easily accessible, long -term support and services after their treatment has concluded.

Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 347 Sharp 2019 CHNA: Case Study - \"Ashley\" Ashley 's High -Risk Pregnancy: A Physical and Emotional Journey Ashley is a 42 -year-old, African American woman who has taught elementary school for nearly two decades; she is beloved for her intelligence, genui ne love of children, infectious laugh, and strong work ethic. Ashley is pregnant with her second child. She has a 7 -year- old girl, Natasha, at home, who was born at 35 weeks, 1 day gestation, two and a half hours after Ashley's membranes ruptured. Natash a spent 4 days in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and was discharged. Natasha suffered no long-term effects from her early delivery, but Ashley remembers the time her daughter spent in the NICU as extremely stressful and anxiety -provoking \u2014 unlike anything she and her husband had ever experienced before. Ashley and her husband waited four years before trying to conceive again, in part because of the traumatic nature of Natasha's birth. Unfortunately, Ashley had two miscarriages, one at 7 w eeks' gestation and the other at 15 weeks' gestation, before this pregnancy. As a result, Ash ley and her husband are both thrilled and very nervous about this pregnancy. Thirty weeks into her pregnancy, Ashley comes into the triage unit at Sharp Mar y Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns (SMBHWN). After a physical examination, a physician confirms that Ashley's membranes have ruptured. As in her first pregnancy, Ashley is once again experiencing what is known as Preterm Premature Rupture of the Membranes or PROM, one of the most common causes of premature birth, and one of the most common reasons women are admitted to the Perinatal Special Care U nit (PSCU) at SMBH WN. Meeting Ashley's Medical Needs Ashley is admitted to the PSCU at SMBH WN, where she will re main until she delivers. Ashley's obstetrician consults with a perinat ologist and neonatologist, and they agree on the following plan: Administer intravenous antibiotics for 48 hours followed by 5 days of oral antibiotics to minimize risk of infection, tw o doses of corticosteroid to enhance fetal lung development, and one dose of magnesium sulphate for fetal neural protection Check Ashley's vital signs every four hours, monitor for signs of infection Check fetal heart rate and for uterine contractions ever y four hours Prem ature Birth and PROM Premature delivery occurs in approximately 10% of all births in the United States1 Preterm Premature Rupture of the Membranes (PROM) complicates an estimated 3% of all pregnancies .2 About 1/3 of premature births are caused by PROM .3 Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 348 Perform weekly ultrasounds to check amniotic fluid levels Arrange physical therapy (PT) consult within 48 hours of admission, offer PT as necessary The hope is that Ashley's labor will not begin for at least another three weeks, but no attemp ts will be made to stop her labor once it begins. If the baby is born, as expected, before full -term, he will be transferred immediately to the NICU at SMBH WN for assessment, monitoring, and any necessary interventions. Meeting Ashley's Social, Emotional, and Practical Needs Ashley knew that her pregnancy was considered higher risk than usual since she was older and had a history of PROM, and she is grateful for the care she is receiving. Nevertheless, the practical and emotional realities of Ashley 's situation are overwhelming to h er. She feels as if she has no control over her life and is worried about being a burden. Ashley finds herself crying a lot and is worried about her baby: Will her baby be ok? Will he live? How long will he have to be in the hospital after he is born? Ar e there long -term effects of being born so early? Will he be able to nurse? Will his breathing be labored? Will she be able to hold him? Will he be lonely in the NICU if she isn't there all the time? Will he bond with her if she can't bring him home? Ashley remembers the NICU and all its beeping machines and long tubes. She also remembers the tiny, fragile -looking babies housed within its walls. And she is scared. On top of that, she is uncomfortable lying in bed all the time. And she is lonely. And bored . Ashley is also worried about a host of practical issues : Who will find a substitute teacher for her and how will she get the lesson plans to the substitute? How long will her maternity leave be now that she is out of work so much earlier than expected ? How will they afford the co -pays for her hospitalization? When will her disability payments start? How will her husband cope with caring for their home, their child, and their pets by himself? And is she worried about her daughter at home: How will Nat asha cope with being without her mom until the baby is born? Will she be scared? Who will pick her up from school , help her with her homework , and get her to playdates and birthday parties? How will they take care of the baby in the NICU and take care of N atasha at the same time? Will Natasha's relationship with the baby be affected by his time in the NICU? Fortunately, the caregivers on the SMBHWN PSCU have extensive experience in caring for women like Ashley with high -risk pregnancies. They answer her q uestions, reassure her about her baby's health, monitor her health and the health of her baby closely, and Women with high -risk pregnancies are at risk of anxiety and depression.4-7 Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 349 ensure that she receives a wide range of services to meet her psychosocial needs. During her stay, Ashley: Works with a SMBHWN social worker, who assesses Ashley's needs and helps her arrange her disability payments, navigate her insurance plan, and formulate a plan for after the baby is born; teaches her about resources for premature babies, like the Early Start program; and provides her with much -needed emotional support. The social worker is also actively monitoring Ashley for signs of serious depression. Equally important, the social worker arranges for a tour of the NICU, where Ashley meets other moms of premature babies and is able to see babies who were born at the same gestation her baby is at now. Attends the Baby Chat group with other mothers on the PSCU. The prenatal educator who facilitates the group answers the moms' questions about caring for babie s, both premature and full -term, and talks about resources in the community. She also goes to an Arts for Healing group in the lobby of the unit. Both of these groups help Ashley battle the loneliness and isolation of being hospitalized. Receives bedside p et therapy, music therapy, and art therapy. Ashley treasures her time with the therapy dog who visits her and she enjoys her time in music and art therapy. She also loves it when the volunteer violinist comes to her room \u2014 they love to chat, and the music cheers her up. The Baby Fifteen days after Ashley 's admission to SMBHWN, contractions begin. She delivers her little boy just three hours later. He is 33 weeks, 1 day gestation. The delivery goes smoothly, and Ashley and her husband welcome Baby Neal who weighs 4 pounds, 6 ounces and is 17 inches long. Ashley is officially discharged 48 ho urs later. She decides, however, to take advantage of the SMBHWN \"hotel\" program where she is allowed to stay in a hospital room, without hospital services, to be near her baby. She is concerned about the additional expense but cannot bear the thought of being away from Neal. Ashley returns home after a week and makes twice daily visits to see Neal in the NICU. The transition home is challenging for Ashley and her family on many levels. They are faced with renegotiating their Women who are hospitalized with high - risk pregnancies benefit from services such as support groups and music, art, and recreational therapy .8-11 Comm Community Engagement Findings: Gaps in Services High-risk pregnancies take an emotional toll on women and their families. Financial concerns are a primary source of stress for women with high -risk pregnancies. Women need help navigating the insurance and disability systems. The lack of available transitional services once the mother and her baby are home is a major gap in care. Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 350 roles and responsibilities w ithin the family and with rebuilding the structure of their daily lives. In addition, now that the major crisis has passed, Ashley and her husband must contend with paying the accumulating bills, determining when Ashley will need to return to work, and get ting a nursery and supplies ready for Neal. Physically, Ashley is still recovering from childbirth, and she is pumping breast milk every four hours. She is exhausted and overwhelmed. Overall, Neal does well. He can breathe on his own but does have diffic ulty with feeding and develops a severe case of jaundice. He spends three weeks in the hospital. When he is discharged, the family joyfully welcomes him home but also faces new challenges to the family schedule and routines. Ashley , especially, struggles. She wants to breastfeed her baby, but Neal does not latch well, and Ashley cannot find the time or the energy to return to the hospital to receive lactation consulting, so she continues to pump milk every four hours. She finds this both depressing and exha usting. Ashley is also anxious about finding appropriate childcare for her tiny baby as she must return to work in six short weeks. Ashley desperately needs more support but simply does not know how to find it. Sources Cited: 1. Martin JA, Hamilton BE, Osterman MJK, Driscoll AK, Drake P. Births: Final Data for 2017.

Navigators and social workers may set up family meetings to initiate conversations and provide clear communication about the treatment trajectory. They help structure family roles and responsibilities during treatment. They talk to physicians about recommending home health when needed. They may help parents figure out how to talk about the cancer in an age -appropriate way with their children, and they help patients and their families find local resources. Social workers and navigators continually reevaluate patients' needs and serve as a source of reassurance and support. All of this is done in the context of a trusting relationship that is built over time. In addition, the navigators and social workers: Provide ongoing r einforcement of treatment plan and goals Provide education on what to expect during treatment, anticipated side effects, and ways to manage them Support patient compliance and best outcomes Provide ongoing assessment of patient barriers to care, nutrition, and psychosocial support needs Assist with resources/referrals for transportation, financial grants, and other services as appropriate Provide and review survivorship care plans Provide patients with education information Inform patients about programs an d services at Sharp Navigators and social workers also coordinate care with o rganization s such as Jewish Family Service and Mama's Kitchen for meal delivery and transportation options. They also refer patients to Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital during psychiatr ic emergencies and to psychiatrists for psychotropic medications when mental health issues are of concern. Diabetes Navigation Services and Care Coordination Community engagement participants described the purpose of the diabetes health educator's job a s to empower the patients to \"own their health\" and provide education to all family members who are willing to participate.

When possible, these organizat ions shared the link to the surve y with their clientele. Table 1 (below) describes the online 2019 CHNA survey respondents. Survey questions were primarily centered around the prioritization of health needs and the identification of social predictors of he alth.

The first question asked survey participants to rank 13 health conditions, with 1 h aving the greatest impact on the overall health and well -being within San Diego communities. The following were identified as the top five health conditions in San Diego County. Behavioral Health Diabetes Cardiovascular Disease Cancer Obesity Sharp Memorial Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 370 In addition to behavioral health being identified as the number one health condition, 63% of survey respondents believe that behavioral health is worsening for San Diego County residents. From a list of 15, the following were identified as the SDOH that h ave the greatest influence on poor health outcomes in San Diego County communities. In addition, the majority of survey respondents thought economic security (55%), has gotten worse over the past three years. The final ranking question took the top five health conditions and top five SDOH that participants previously ranked and put them into one list of ten. Participants were asked to rank this combined list in order of importance, 1 through 10. Below are the top ten ranked list of health conditions and SDOH together, with 1 having the greatest impact on the overall health and well -being of San Diego County residents. 1. Access to Care 2. Behavioral Health 3. Economic Security 4. Health Insurance 5. Homelessness 6. Housing 7. Diabetes 8. Care Management 9. Health Behaviors 10. Cardiova scular Disease A total of three health conditions and seven SDOH are represented in this list. This demonstrates that survey respondents consider social determinants to be more significant than health conditions in term s of their overall well -being. Trend s over Time Survey participants were asked whether the top five health conditions they identified were improving, staying the same, or getting worse over the past 3 years. Behavioral health, economic security, homelessness, and housing were identified by the majority of survey participants as getting worse in San Diego County.
