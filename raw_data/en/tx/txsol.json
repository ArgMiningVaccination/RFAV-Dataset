fail the MDGs and will not fail the SGDs The year 2021 should have been that of the consolidation of the first cycle of sustainable development operationalized by the 2017- 2021 Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (PEDS), but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be remembered as the first year of sustainable recovery. Despite three terrible years of drought and the pandemic, between 2016 and 2019, Cabo Verde grew, on average, 4.7% a year, and reduced the public deficit by 2.4% and the public debt/ GDP ratio to 124.2%, but in 2020, like in the rest of the Small Island Developing States, we faced a harsh recession of 14.8% due to the impact of the pandemic. We elaborated and implemented the 2017- 2021 PEDS, which was aligned with the SDGs, the 2063 Africa Agenda and the SAMOA Pathway, thus framing our challenges within the context of sustainable development and basing our actions on global references. We managed to reduce poverty to 13.1% in 2020 thanks to the growth registered up until the pre-crisis year (with an average of 4.7% per year) and to a major reduction in inequalities that came as the result of investments in decentralization, in the territorialization of public policies, in inclusion, in regional development, in the reduction of regional asymmetries and in good governance. We have devised a master plan for the elec - tricity sector and a electric mobility policy charter in order to reach a 53% renewable energies penetration rate by 2030 and massify electrical mobility by 2050. In 2022 we expect to make access to electricity universal, meeting one of the targets of SDG 7 eight years ahead of schedule, and we have managed to ensure running water in the homes of 69% of the population, reaching a daily per capita consumption of 43.1 liters per person, thus surpassing the PLENAS (National Strategic Plan for Water and Sani - tation) target for 2030 while reducing losses. Even so, considerable investments must still be made to ensure sustainable management centered on desalinization. With the massification of professional training and professional internships and the promotion of youth entrepreneurship, had managed, before the pandemic, to reduce the proportion of youth not in employment education, or training (NEET) by 4.1% a year, the unemployment rate to 11.3% and the young unemployment rate to 25%. We con- siderably expanded social security coverage from 39.5% in 2015 to 55.5% in 2020, reduced informal employment by approximately 4.3% a year and moved forwards with the imple - mentation of the decent work agenda. We regionalized the PEDS and reinforced trust, dialogue and complementarity in our relationship with local government, increased the resources allocated to municipal govern - ments through budget transfers, which grew, on average, 13.7% a year until 2019, and 6.9% a year by 2020, and through the Requali - fication, Rehabilitation and Accessibilities Program (PRRA), some US$ 56.4 million was accorded to and invested in the country's municipalities following local priorities, lending a never-before-experienced dynamic to local development. We implemented the Platforms for Local Development and SDG Localization, and the country's municipal - ities elaborated Municipal Strategic Sus - tainable Development Plans aligned with the PEDS and the SDGs, which served as excellent mechanisms for the localization of the SDGs and the qualification of technical and political dialogue between central and local authorities and other partners, as well as for the acceleration of sustainable development. We have made notable progress in the realm of gender equality and seen a reduction in the incidence of gender-based violence. With the mainstreaming of gender in the 6PEDS, in tourism (the only country in the world to do so) and in professional training, gender-sensitive budgeting has become a reality. We are also the first African coun- try to join the world platform for LBGTI rights, and were elected a member of the commission on the status of women for 2022-2026. We unanimously approved the gender parity law and, in terms of political participation, have achieved the goals out - lined therein in local government (42%), parliament (38%) and in the executive (32%). Among other things, we carried out tax reforms, reforms in air transportation, today a sector profoundly compromised by restric - tions to domestic and international mobility, and reforms in inter-island sea transportation, while at the same time improving internal connectivity. We have strengthened partner - ships and external credibility, as is shown by the mobilization of the international com - munity to confront the pandemic, and Cabo Verde continues to be a preferred destination for foreign direct investment, especially in the domain of tourism. We invested in the development of the health sector and faced the pandemic while preserving people's health and lives. We have included the HPV vaccine in the national immunization agenda and have begun vaccination against COVID-19 in order to be able to cover at least 70% of the population of vaccinable age by the end of this year, and will expand vaccination coverage to the entire population in 2022. We have invested in education, carrying out reforms in the sector and eliminating tuition fees in elementary and secondary education. We have reinforced infrastructure programs in order to accelerate inclusion, adding to value to territories and to the qualification of cities. We have enhanced regulation, devising governing instruments for the transition of the maritime economy to the blue economy, including the Policy Charter for the Blue Economy, the Unified Blue Economy Strategic Framework, the National Blue Economy Plan and the Blue Economy Promotion Program. We have attributed due value to Cabo Verdean culture, and the musical genre \"morna\" having been granted the status of intangible culture heritage by UNESCO. We take due care of biodiversity and geodiversity, and the islands of Maio and Fogo have been classified as UNESCO World Biosphere Reserves. We have reinforced justice and security, reducing inci - 7 dents and the perception of lack of safety, and have reinforced governance with the full functioning, complementarity and subsidiarity of the organs of sovereignty. We have achieved the affirmation of local government and the democratic rule of law and have taken first steps in the reform of public administration, the modernization of public finance manage- ment, oversight and transparency Having accepted the challenge of the decade of action, we carried out the Cabo Verde Ambition 2030 exercise and elaborated the Cabo Verde 2030 Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda, an overarching instru - ment aimed at aligning political subjects and economic and social actors by laying down the foundations of future national, sectorial, municipal and regional strategic plans, but above all a long-term reference for the various different domestic actors and development partners that can serve as support for strategic dialogue for the sustainable development of Cabo Verde. The need has been stressed to take the Vul - nerability Profile into greater consideration as a specific criterion for the SIDS in access to official development assistance and concessional financing, as well as the to create a SIDS Compact as a mechanism of excellence for the financing of sustainable recovery. Cabo Verdean authorities, along- side the other SIDS and with the support of the United Nations and other development partners, propose promoting the construc - tion of an international commitment on \"The post-COVID-19 economic recovery and the financing of sustainable development in the SIDS.\" The COVID-129 pandemic and Cabo Verde Ambition 2030 resulted in structural changes and priorities, namely related to fighting impoverishment and ensuring health security and, especially, to the diversification of the economy, for which the expansion of public investment is urgent - this, within a context of over-indebtedness aggravated by the pandemic. It is, as such, vital to restruc - ture or pardon, at least in part, Cabo Verde's foreign public debt, so that investments with transformative impacts are not put off and to avoid the blockage, if not collapse, of the State and the destruction of the dreams of the Cabo Verdean population. We cannot accept collapse, as our ambi - tion for the 2030 horizon is to make Cabo 8Verde a consolidated, modern and inclusive democracy, a digitalized, emerging and resilient blue nation with an economy of circulation located in the Middle Atlantic and a member state of ECOWAS, with full employment and shared prosperity - a country that is useful to the world and a point of reference and pride for all. We have an innovative, enterprising, ambi - tious and audacious young population and a State that is their partner. We are a credible country and will recover the gains we have made. We will ensure an ever-better busi - ness environment and the consolidation of the budget. Above all, we have good development partners. We are a country of opportunities, and we trust in the present and future of Cabo Verde. With a private sector leading the economy and with good partnerships, together we will achieve the sustainable development of these Atlantic islands.Cabo Verde did not fail the MDGs and will not fail the SDGs. Jos\u00e9 Ulisses de Pina Correia e Silva Prime Minister 9 MESSAGE FROM THE RESIDENT COORDINATOR OF THE UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM IN CABO VERDE It is a pleasure to witness the remarkable commitment of Cabo Verde to accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and share its progress, challenges and lessons with the rest of the world through this sec - ond Voluntary National Review (VNR) for the 2021 United Nations High Level Political Forum. Despite the tremendous impact of COVID 19 pandemic in this small island state, Cabo Verde's resilience and sustain- able development ambition continues unwavering, underpinned by democratic and good governance values, solid institutions, the rule of law and the understanding that peace, inclusion and social cohesion are a pre-condition for its successful journey towards the SDGs. The Government and the people of Cabo Verde embraced Agenda 2030 in a whole-of-society approach. All public institutions, local authorities, civil society organizations, private sector entities and academia were fully engaged in the elabo - ration of the new sustainable development strategy for the Decade of Action - \"Cabo Verde Ambition 2030\" and in this second Voluntary National Review Report. The country has established the institu - tional arrangements and legal and policy framework needed to implement the SDGs, to ensure ownership and integration, to make all efforts to leave no one behind, and to boost means of implementation starting with domestic resources and new partnerships and innovative finance. Cabo Verde also positioned itself at the fore - front of the localization of the Agenda 2030, the progress towards gender equality, the coherence between sustainable develop - ment policies, strategies, plans, budgets and the collection and analysis of reliable and disaggregated data needed for evidence based public policy decisions. These efforts, still incipient in 2018 at the time of the first VNR, are starting to produce results as presented and analyzed in this second VNR. Cabo Verde is recognized as a reference in the region and a source of inspiration in many aspects for any country aiming at achieving most of the SDGs in a very challenging global context. First and foremost, the challenges faced by Cabo Verde are linked to structural con - straints and vulnerability shared with all Small Island Developing States (SIDS): small landmass; small population; geographical isolation and spatial dispersion; high cost of transport, communication and energy; extreme vulnerability to climate change and natural hazards; fragility of island ecosystems and high level of endemism; narrow resource-based and undiversified economy; remoteness from markets and strong dependence on trade, travel and remittances; high sensitivity to international fluctuations and narrow trade partners; and limited access to concessional financing. 10These underlying vulnerabilities inherent to the archipelagic condition, were extremely exacerbated with the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 in Cabo Verde, halting progress in four years of fiscal consolidation, con - tinued poverty reduction, dynamic average growth (+4,6% annually) and dramatic improvement of basic and social services, as presented in this VNR. Lessons from the 2008 crisis draw a perspective of slow recovery, yet Cabo Verde history, the resilience of Cabo Verde's people, its strong institutions and inclusive public policies are a testimony of the coun - try's capacity to transform challenges into opportunities. The United Nations stands together with Cabo Verde to ensure that the pre-crisis development gains are not lost, and that the Decade of Action will not only be a period of recovery, but also of transformation: Economic diversification for a just, greener sustainable growth, creating jobs and income opportunities for youth and women; bridging remaining gaps in terms of universal access to basic and social services; and continue progresses in protecting the country's incredibly rich marine and terres - trial ecosystems. Ana Patricia Gra\u00e7a Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Cabo Verde 11 HIGHLIGHTS The review process 1. Governance Structure: The VNR was coordi - nated by the Ministry of Finance and carried out by the Working Group for the Elaboration of the VNR chaired by the National Director of Planning and composed of an Evaluation Analysis and Writing Sub-group integrating relevant public entities, United Nations agencies, civil society and private sector organization, workers and academia. 2. Participation: Several presential and online workshops have been led by local authorities, civil society organization and private sector in different municipalities and islands, to ensure a whole-of-society engagement in this exercise, and use it to boost SDGs implementation for the Decade of Action.3. Methodology: The VNR was prepared according to the methodological guidelines and best practices of the United Nations and was based on the Strategic Sustain - able Development Plan (PEDS 2017-2021) Progress Report for the 2017-2020 period, Cabo Verde's Strategic Agenda for Sustain- able Development Ambition 2030, COVID- 19 Socio-Economic Impact Assessment, COVID-19 Socioeconomic Response and Recovery Plan and the ongoing Leave No One Behind Assessment. SDGs ownership and institutional arrangements 1. The integration of the Agenda 2030 in the National institutional framework and public policies and plans is ensured by the Implementation Coordination Mechanism established in the SDG Roadmap approved by the Government at the end of 2019. It is essentially based on valuing the role of the National Planning System, the National Statistical System and Government deci - sion-making bodies, it is part of the Ambi - tion 2030 and is approved by Law of the National Assembly. 2. Ownership of SDGs by Local authorities, Civil Society, Academia and Private Sector: At national level, an NGO platform gather civil society implementation, and private sector entities work together with the Government with the facilitation of Cabo Verde's Stock Exchange. Both participate in all strategic processes for SDGs implementation. At local level, Platforms for the Localization of the 2030 Agenda bring together municipalities, State representatives, civil society orga - nizations, Universities and private sector entities. 3. Stakeholders engagement for the Decade of Action: The Government will continue to reinforce the participation of these stake - holders in the elaboration, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of sustainable development through more decentralization, public private partnerships, social concer - tation; and the reinforcement of the social, economic and environmental council and development of the social economy. Leave No One Behind 1. Who? The VNR identifies individual and collective barriers, based on structural, institutional or cultural bias, and nine groups most at risk of being left behind: extremely poor, youth NEET, elderly, people with dis- ability, immigrants, prisoners, children and adolescents at risks, sexual minorities, high- 12lighting that within these groups, women and girls face intersectional risks. 2. What? The VNR defines the causal chain that underpin the barriers and deprivation these groups face: manifestations, imme- diate causes, underlying causes and then structural causes. 3. How? The Government commit to a set of measures, ongoing or to be developed, to address these causes and enhance inclusion and full access to their rights for all the population Progress on SDGs 1. People (SDGs 1 to 6): The fight against poverty and hunger is a priority across gov -ernments and investment in human capital has been constant. This continuity and a solid democratic and governance basis led to improvements of living conditions. Global absolute poverty was halved in the past 20 years, with a slow-down from 2% annual rate during the MDGs period to 1.2% since 2015. Because of structural constraints linked to the lack of arable lands and freshwater, food security is one of the country's major chal - lenge and malnutrition the most important public health issue, with a high prevalence of stunting and wasting among children under 5. Human capital has always been a high priority and SDGs 3 and 4 are already outstanding performers on most indicators. The new parity Law, efforts to reduce Gender Based Violence and socioeconomic inequal - ities are consolidating gender equality in Cabo Verde into a regional best practice. Finally, 86% of the population has access to an improved source of drinking water and 82.9% to at least basic sanitation (92% rural, 73.2% urban). 2. Prosperity (SDGs 7 to 11): Inclusive, sus - tainable growth and jobs is a solid priority in Cabo Verde's sustainable development Strategy and plans. Economic diversification, a strong focus on water-energy nexus, and an integration in global and regional value chains beyond unilateral trade dependency, are the drivers of this growth model, mainly oriented towards services to the world. Internal constraints, in terms of connec - tivity, production, and human resources, are being addressed. Beyond its devastat - ing impact on tourism, COVID-19 affected 13 several investments and projects. Limited fiscal space and shrinking Foreign Direct Investment could further undermine the potential for public and private investment in the country's infrastructure, equipment and skills for economic development. 3. Planet (SDGs 12 to 15): Cabo Verde per - forms well on environmental sustainability. All indicators for SDGs 12 and 13 are on track, especially in terms of waste and emissions (although recent data is missing in many cases). The country made blue economy a priority and an SDG accelerator, being one of the Top 10 marine biodiversity hotspot and increasingly reinforcing ocean resources preservation. In a context of considerable impact of climate change on land and freshwater reserves, every effort is made to preserve terrestrial ecosystems, with one fifth of the land already protected. 4. Peace (SDG 16) and Partnerships (SDG 17): The country has been at peace and with strong national institutions since the independence, and governance is a national historical stronghold. Despite many achieve - ments in countering drug trafficking and organized crime, the country still faces some challenges related to the capacity to respond to emerging challenges posed by organized crime, as well as petty and medium-scale crime, including urban crime, which has triggered a perception of insecu - rity among the population. Other threats to human security, such as GBV, sexual assault and sexual abuse of children were reduced but persist. The internal indicators on Part -nerships are good, such as tax to GDP ratio and Government spending on health and education, or the proportion of individuals using the Internet New and emerging challenges 1. Emerging from COVID-19 pandemic: Like most SIDS, Cabo Verde was deeply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 14.8% recession in 2020 and the destruction of 9% of employment, the worsening of indebt - edness and the public deficit, the increase in poverty budget priorities being oriented towards the health, economic and social emergency. Cabo Verde's biggest challenge is to vaccinate, during this year, at least 70% of the population and generalize in 2022, resume tourism and economic growth, and 14overcome the challenges that determine the continuation of sustainable development path: the development of human capital, health, resilience and reduction of the cost of factors, the diversification of the economy, promoting alongside tourism, which remains the leading sector, the blue economy, digital economy, industry, inter - national health platform, smart agriculture and culture and creative industries, youth employment, gender equality, decentraliza - tion, regional development and convergence. 2. Financing resilience and the SDGs: The financing of sustainable development that we propose to face together with the other SIDS is an even greater challenge, promoting the consideration of the Vulnerability Profile as a specific criterion in accessing public aid for development and financing under concessional conditions, the creation of a SIDS Compact and building an international commitment on \"Post-COVID-19 economic recovery and the financing of sustainable development in SIDS\".3. We, the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) presenting our Voluntary national Review (VNR) this year (Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Cabo Verde, Cuba, and Domini- can Republic), decided to come together to highlight our common vulnerabilities and development challenges and opportunities in our respective VNRs through this common section. We come from different regions of the World, are from different income groups, have different national priorities and sustainable development paths, specific to our national contexts yet in line with the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. The Principle of National Ownership is central to our com- mon pursuit of sustainable development. As a result, each of our VNRs is of course country specific, as are the achievements presented in it. However, no matter how varied this progress has been so far, we all face unique structural and exogenous vulnerabilities that are shared by all SIDS countries and are specific to us. Means of implementation 1. INFF: The INFF will create the enabling framework and financing solutions for key transformations in Cabo Verde's sustainable finance landscape, to bridge financing gaps that slow down the implementation of SDGs, national plans and local strategies. 2. Debt forgiveness: Structural changes and priorities emerge due to COVID-19 and for the Decade of Action, to fight impoverishment, improve health security and transform the economy. The expansion of public investment cannot be postponed. Different financing sources are critical for transforming projects, in a context of over-indebtedness aggravated by the pandemic and the Middle Income Country status. External debt forgiveness is therefore vital to enable investments in sustainable development and avoid the blockade, if not the collapse of the State, the setback and destruction of the dreams of Cape Verdeans. Next Steps 1. Vision for 2030: It is our ambition, by 2030, to make Cabo Verde a consolidated and modern, inclusive democracy, a blue, digitized, emerging and resilient nation, a circulation economy located in the inte - grated Middle Atlantic in ECOWAS with full employment and shared prosperity, a country useful to the world and a reference of pride for everyone. 2. COVID-19 recovery and economic trans - formation: Strong Government measures kept poverty at a relatively low level despite the overwhelming impact of the pandemic. However economic recovery must take over to create jobs and incomes. Although tourism will remain the most dynamic sector, while moving towards more sus - tainability and impact on local economic development, other sectors are emerging as SDGs accelerators, and will be prioritized for the Decade of Action: Blue Economy, Renewable Energy (including e-mobility) and the digitalization of the economy and the administration. Besides, human capital will remain at the heart of Cabo Verde's path towards sustainable development. 15 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. Elaborated by the Government of Cabo Verde in strong partnership with the United Nations, the 2021 Cabo Verde Voluntary National Review is a tool for assessing the country's progress and for reaffirming of its long-term commitments and strategies for sustainable development. The exercise was coordinated by the Ministry of Finances through the National Directorate of Planning and was carried out by the Working Group for the Elaboration of the 2021 Cabo Verde Voluntary National Review, chaired by the National Director of Planning and made of an Evaluation, Analysis and Redaction Sub-Group with members of the National Directorate of Planning and other public entities, United Nations specialists and representatives from civil society, the private sector, workers and institutions of higher learning. 2. The 2021 Cabo Verde Voluntary National Review was elaborated according to the methodological guidelines and best practices of the United Nations, and was based essentially on the SSDP (Strategic Sustainable Development Plan) Progress Report for the 2017-2020 period, which serves as the foundation for evidence of the progress made by the country, with other important sources being the Cabo Verde 2030 Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda, the COVID-19 Socio-economic Impact Assessment and the \"Leave No One Behind\" assessment. The exercise was conducted in accordance with a roadmap and methodological guidelines elaborated by the National Directorate of Planning and led by working groups. 3. 3. The SSDP Progress Report was elabo- rated by the National Directorate of Planning and the various sectors and discussed in 19 forums on progress in the 29 SSDP 2017- 2021 programs, the SDGs they achieve and the impetus for the achievement thereof with the active, effective and wide-ranging participation of stakeholders, with a total of 286 participations, namely the public sec - tor, the United Nations System, institutions of higher learning, the private sector, civil society organizations, professional associ- ations and the media. A mobilization and communication strategy was implemented and includes the mobilization of stake - holders and preparation of communication materials. 4. Located off the West African coast, some 500 kilometers from Senegal, Cabo Verde is an archipelago made up of 10 islands, nine of which are inhabited and one of which is uninhabited, and eight islets. The country's total land area is 4,033 km2, but Cabo Verde is mostly sea - in other words, it has a vast Exclusive Economic Zone of some 734,000 km2, some 183 times its total land area. Approximately 9% of the land area is occupied by agriculture, and all of the islands are of volcanic origin. Indeed, Cabo Verde has one active volcano, on the island of Fogo, which last erupted in 2014-2015, with negative consequences for those living in the surrounding zones. 165. Like most SIDS, Cabo Verde was pro - foundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 14.8% recession in 2020 and the elimination of 9% of all jobs, an increase in indebtedness and in the public deficit and an increase in poverty, with budget priorities oriented toward dealing with the resulting health, economic and social emergency. As a Middle-Income Small Island State, Cabo Verde's greatest challenge is to vaccinate at least 70% of the population by the end of the current year and to achieve the overall recovery of tourism and economic growth in 2022, as well as to overcome the challenges to the continuation of the path toward sustainable development - in other words, the development of human capital, health, resilience, the reduction of factor costs and the diversification of the economy, promoting the blue economy, the digital economy, industry, the international health platform, smart agriculture, culture and the creative industries, youth employ - ment, gender equality, decentralization, regional development and convergence, all of this alongside tourism, which remains the leading sector. Another major challenge is the financing of sustainable development, which we propose be confronted jointly with the other SIDS by promoting the consideration of the Vulnerability Profile as a specific criterion in access to public development aid and concessional financing, the creation of a SIDS Compact and the construction of an international commit - ment on \"Post-COVID-19 economic recovery and the financing of sustainable develop- ment in the SIDS.\" 6. In Cabo Verde, the Sustainable Development Goals are made operational by the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (SSDP, known also by the Portuguese acronym PEDS) aligned with the SDGs. The next SSDP will have the Cabo Verde Strategic sustainable Development Agenda and the 10th Legislature Government Program as essential references. The commitment of the stakeholders in the implementation of the SSDP is, in actuality, their commitment to the implementation of the SGDs. In this regard, we may cite the public sector, local government, the United Nations System, the country's institutions of higher learning, the branches of government, the private sector, civil society organizations, labor represen- tatives and the media. 7. In order to facilitate and make the exe - cution of the SSDP viable, the government has implemented mechanisms of increased transparency and social justice in its rela - tionship with civil society organizations and 17 had invested in leveraging microfinance institutions. Institutions representing the private sector and laborers are parties to the 2017-2021 Strategic Coordination Accord and participate in various different consul - tative bodies. Events such as the 4th World Local Economic Development Forum, the Conference on New Partnerships for Sus - tainable Development and the Cabo Verde Investment Forum have contributed toward helping achieve the SSDP and the SDGs. 8. On the sectorial level, sectorial plans such as the Strategic Education Plan, the Main Priorities of the Strategic Sustainable Tourism Plan and the Thematic and Regional Strategic Health Plans facilitated the imple - mentation of the programs, while tax sector reforms aligned with and contributed to the carrying out of the SSDP. On the regional and local level, the regionalization of the 2017- 2021 SSDP, the 2030 Platforms for Local Development and Objectives Program and the Strategic Municipal Plans aided in the implementation of the 2017-2021 SSDP. 9. Decentralization, public-private part - nerships, social coordination, the Economic, Social and Environmental Council, the development of the social economy and partnerships in general as mechanisms aimed at helping accelerate sustainable development constitute mechanisms for enhancing the commitment and sustainable participation of stakeholders in the elabo- ration, execution, monitoring and evaluation of the 2017-2021 SSDP, the SGDs and the Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda.10. Cabo Verde has made notable progress in its nearly 46 years as an independent state, having graduated to the category of Middle Income Country in 2007, but remains a nation of profound inequalities and regional asymmetries that have been constant over the past 81 years, and the COVID-19 epidemic is aggravating existing social vulnerabilities and increasing poverty. As such, many people continue to be left behind, while risk remains. The underlying causes of being left behind are collective in nature and have to do with belonging to households and agricultural and livestock farming activities represented by women, especially those located in informal urban settlements and in rural zones, as well as individual in nature - in other words, causes related to gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, physical conditions or sit - uations related to the law. 11. They include the 175,844 persons in Cabo Verde live in absolute poverty - that is, with less than US$ 2.77 per day - of whom 88,093 are women, the 77,480 who are unemployed and are not part of the educational or professional training sys - tem, of whom 53% are female, the 48,359 elderly citizens, of whom 60% are female, the approximately 14,300 immigrants, most of whom (63.4%) are male and the vast majority of whom (78.9%) hail from conti- nental Africa, the 104,342 people (17.5% of the population) with at least one type of handicap and, especially, the those with extreme special needs, equivalent to about 3.5% of Cabo Verde's population. They are also the 1,798 inmates and other individuals who have been deprived of their freedom, most of whom (97.4%) are males, the 154,049 children and teenagers in the country, of whom 75,886 are female, and, particularly, the 29,350 families living in poverty, the minorities made invisible as a result of their sexual orientation, whose true numbers and detailed profiles are not known, and a group that is at risk in a cross-cutting manner made up of young girls and women. 12. Measures must be adopted within the scope of the 2021-2022 responses, recovery and social development plan, and, especially, the 2022-2026 SSDP, in order to include those who have been left behind and reduce risk, at the risk of compromising the achievement of the SDGs (in other words, combating poverty, food insecurity and income inequality) as well as inclusive economic growth, incomes and prices, investments that reduce territorial asymmetries, the enhancement and effec - tive integration of the Education, Training and Employment monitoring and evaluation system, the enhancement of the National Statistics System, the development of pri- vate social solidarity institutions, capacity building and specific measures geared to those groups who have been left behind or who are at risk of being left behind. 13. According to estimates from the INE, in 2020 there was a total of 72,874 poor per - sons living in Cabo Verde - in other words, with less than US$ 1.90 a day, the equivalent of 13.1% of the population, a figure standing at 13% among men and 13.1% among women. Absolute poverty is more highly concen - trated in rural areas, where 24.3% of the 18population is poor, a figure that stands at 8.1% in urban areas. Absolute poverty dropped by 10.6 percentage points - in other words, 2.1 percentage points a year - despite the effects of three years of severe drought and the COVID-29 pandemic. The incidence of poverty reduces with age, going from some 22% among children 0-4 years of age to 7.8% among the population 65 years old or more. As such, approximately 77.9% of the poor are less than 35 years old, which underscores the level of juvenile poverty. Poverty is higher among the unemployed, but some 6.5% of employed individuals are poor. 14. S\u00e3o Filipe is the poorest municipality in Cabo Verde, with approximately 39.7% of the population living in poverty, while Boa Vista has the lowest poverty rate, with just 1.7% of the population in this situation. How - ever, 59% of Cabo Verde's poor population lives in the municipalities of Praia with the rest living in the country's other 17 municipalities. Poverty increases with the size of family aggregates, being practically null among aggregates with 1 member and standing at 29.5% among those with 7 mem - bers or more. Using the national poverty line, Cabo Verde has 175,844 poor persons - in other words, persons living on less than US$ 2.77 a day, the equivalent of 31.6% of the population. Some 31.2% of men and 32% of women are poor. 15. The incidence of poverty could have been higher in 2020 if it were not for the policies adopted to protect employment and incomes. In 2020, a total of 103, 613 workers were registered as active insurance benefi - ciaries, the equivalent of a coverage rate of 55.5% of the working population, while the non-contributive regime encompassed some 22,866 beneficiaries. The volume of public resources allocated to these programs represents 14.4% of public expenses and 5.1% of GDP. The volume of donations - in other words, of non-debt generating flows - directly allocated to poverty reduction programs represents just 0.2% of GDP. 16. Despite our successful progress over the course of our 46 years of Indepen - dence and the success of the first wave of decentralization through municipalism, Cabo Verde remains a country of profound regional inequalities and asymmetries aggra - vated by territorial discontinuity and by the COVID-129 pandemic. In 2020, the average annual per capital expenditure of the 40% of the population with the lowest incomes fell some 5.7% in relation to the year before, a drop that was greater in urban areas (8%) than in rural areas (3.5%). These expen - ditures grew, overall, approximately 3.2% over the past 5 years (2.4% in urban areas and 3.9% in rural areas), which suggests a reduction in inequality. Some 5.2% of the population lives with consumer expendi - tures of less than 50% of median expendi- tures (5.1% for males and 5.2% for females). The proportion of the population living with consumer expenditures of less than 50% of median expenditures fell 9.8 percentage points since 2015, with the reduction more expressive among women (10.1 pp) than among men (9.5 pp). This dynamic also suggests a reduction in inequalities. 17. The reduction in absolute poverty by some 10.6 percentage points is due in part to the economic growth that averaged some 4.7% a year from 2016 to 2019, but at least also in part to the reduction in inequalities. The volume of public expenditures with social inclusion programs - in other words, \"Guarantee of Access to income, education, care and health,\" which includes Inclusive Social Income and Social Pensions, and \"Guarantee of children's and teenagers' rights and protection\" - accounted for some 14.4% of public expenditures and 5.1% of GDP, averaging 12.4% and 4.1% of public expenditures and GDP over the past 3 years. The massification of professional training and professional internships, the increase in study grants, exemption from elementary and high school tuition, the expansion of social security coverage and, especially, the increase in the amount of resources transferred to municipalities and the Requalification, Rehabilitation and Accessibilities Program, with a large port - folio of works proposed by municipalities, helped reduce asymmetries in terms of opportunities and provided an important boost to the improvement of the distribution of national wealth and, as a result, to the reduction of inequality. 18. Cabo Verde is an extremely vulnera - ble country from the point of view of food security, agricultural and climate change and fluctuations in the world market. In recent years, more than 96% of grains (corn, rice, wheat) came from abroad, and the 19 food aid that corresponds to some 30% of imports has grown ever less significant in comparison to commercial imports due, to a large degree, to Cabo Verde's status as a Middle Income Country and to changes in the modalities of official development assistance. In Cabo Verde, hunger is not a mass phenomenon, but food insecu - rity is present. According to FAO, in 2019, approximately 18.5% of the population was undernourished, and according to data from the 2019 IN-VANF, approximately 33.8% of households could not afford safe, nutritious and sufficient food. Anemia affects some 42% of all children under 5 years of age and is still considered a serious public health problem. 19. Agriculture in Cabo Verde consists pre - dominantly of family farming and occupies slightly more than 9% of the country's ter -ritory. Most plots are small and water is the main limiting factor, along with the scarcity of arable soil, geographical and orographic conditions and the archipelago's territorial discontinuity. Structurally speaking, it is the sector employing the most people. In 2020, the Agricultural Orientation for Public Expenditures Index reached 1.09 - in other words, the weight of agriculture on public expenses was slightly greater than its con - tribution to the GDP. Over the past 18 years, Cabo Verdean authorities have promoted a program aimed at collecting and conserving genetic resources for agriculture and food and for \"genetic improvement\" activities, with the introduction of European animal breeds and the interbreeding thereof with \"local\" breeds. Agricultural production was not directly affected by the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic, but agricultural production costs increased, as did difficul -ties in the distribution of products, although in times of crisis the agricultural sector is traditionally a business opportunity that serves as an alternative to other sectors. 20. The market for Cabo Verdean agriculture could quickly reach 1.5 million consumers, and this demand presents good opportuni - ties in the fresh produce market - in other words, vegetables, tubers, tropical fruits and industrial animal farming products such as meat and eggs. Agriculture also shows a certain potential for the development of fruit and vegetable farming, animal husbandry, specifically animals with a short produc - tion cycle, and agroindustry, but does not have the structural conditions to produce the quantity of food needed by the entire population. Cabo Verdean authorities intend to overcome these challenges, namely those inherent to climate change, and leverage 20the agricultural economy, and will promote conditions liable to significantly increase the production, productivity and added value of agriculture, the transition of traditional and subsistence agriculture to modern, com - petitive agriculture able to attract private investment, reinforce its contribution to food security, penetrate the tourism market and export products abroad. They will also promote conditions to transform agriculture into a new sector of opportunities for young people, one which can generate decent work and income and, above all, contribute to the reduction of inequalities, poverty and regional asymmetries. 21. Significant progress has been made in these last 5 years in the realm of health, with enhancements in the leadership, governance and regulation of the sector and an environment more favorable to private enterprise and public-private partnerships, as well as the consolidation of health regions and regional hospitals. An ambi - tious infra-structuring program was also carried out, and the National Health System is today better prepared to respond to the challenges facing it, namely in the provision of health care, surveillance and security, prevention and the promotion of health. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting public health emergency became the center of priorities. The pandemic put the National Health System's capacities and resilience to the test, but in addition to these emerging challenges, there remain others, such as the need to improve access to health care by promoting equity, the predominance of non-transmissible illnesses, the involvement of professionals and specialists from the Cabo Verdean diaspora, the reinforcement of human resources and the continuous capacity building thereof, and, especially, an increase in the participation of the private sector. 22. Notable progress was made in the realm of reproductive health. Nearly all births are assisted by qualified health professionals. Child and early neo-natal mortality fell while late neo-natal mortality increased slightly, and it is believed that the country will be able to bring an end to avoidable deaths of newborns and children under 1 year of age well before 2030, but teenage pregnancy continues to be a problem. The seroprevalence rate for HIV1 in the 15- to 49-year-old population is 0.4%, standing at 0.6% among women and 0.2% among men. When HIV2 is included, the seropreva - lence rate stands at 0.6%, with 0.7% among women and 0.4% among men. New cases of HIV infection fell as well, as did the inci - dence of tuberculosis, hepatitis, suicide and deaths caused by road accidents. We have been able to ensure high levels of vaccine coverage, and we introduced the vaccine against HPV into the national vaccination calendar, and we began vaccination against COVID-19 and expect to encompass at least 70% of the population before the end of the year, reaching general overall coverage in 2022. Circulatory apparatus illnesses remain the main cause of death. No locally acquired cases of malaria have been registered in the past 3 years, which is one of the criteria for the elimination of malaria as a public health problem in Cabo Verde.23. The Cabo Verdean economy has a job-generating capacity for men that is higher than that for women, who have a lower participation rate in the work force, present a weak presence in technological and scientific areas, earn work incomes that are on average lower than those earned by men throughout all of their active life cycles, are more affected by underemploy - ment and constitute the majority of NEET youth. Women are, however, also those who benefited most from professional training and professional internships. Poverty affects women and men almost equally, but in the realm of education, girls have an advantage in secondary and higher learning. Most of the demand for reproductive health services comes from women, who today on average have 2.5 children, but are also the main vic - tims of gender-based violence crimes, which fortunately have been on a downward trend. Cabo Verde has a legal framework favorable to the promotion of gender equality and has invested in the production and dissemination of gender-sensitive statistics. A systematic approach has been implemented for social mobilization, and strategic alliances have been established in the fight against gender discrimination and gender-based violence. Cabo Verde has adopted gender-sensitive budgets and gender markers on the level of the State Budget. Women's life expectancy is higher than that of men. 24. Education and training are fundamental foundations for the country's development and for personal, professional and social achievement on the part of citizens. In the 2019-2020 school year, a coverage rate of 21 81.6% was achieved with no difference seen between males and females. In 2021/2020, the net rate of schooling reached 92.4%, with 61.2% in secondary schooling and 23.5% in higher education. In 2019/2020, the Parity Index reached 0.98 in pre-school education and 0.93 in elementary education, 1.2 in secondary education and 1.5 in higher edu - cation. In Cabo Verde, the vast majority of the population 15 years of age or over knows how to read and write. The literacy rate reached 88.5% in 2019, some 0.9 percentage points higher than in 2016. The literacy rate is higher among men (93.1%) than among women (83.9%), and almost all young people aged 15 to 24 know how to read and write, with there being practically no different between males and females in this regard. 25. In order to achieve education with a focus on the specificities of the population and exercising active citizenship, incorpo- rating the principles of respect for human rights, social and environmental sustain - ability, and the valuation of diversity and social inclusion, measures were adopted for education on the rights and duties of citizens and on gender equality and equity. In Cabo Verde nearly all schools (97.6%) have access to drinking water, with a similar percentage enjoying bathroom installations (98.9%). Most (89%) elementary schools and secondary schools are connected to the public electricity grid. A total of 200 schools were rehabilitated and 8 new establishments built, and an educational infrastructure management platform was instituted. 26. Education of Excellence is one of the programs of the 2017-2021 PEDS, made operational by the 2017-2021 Strategic Education Plan. The volume of public resources allocated to this program in 2020 reached some US$ 93.2 million. Donations reached some US$ 1 million and represented approximately 1.1% of public expenditures from the Education of Excellence Program. The volume of public expenditures with scholarships reached US$ 6.4 million. In Cabo Verde, nearly all elementary school teachers (98.7%) are specifically trained to be faculty at this level. The issue of the qualification of professionals is particu - larly pertinent in pre-school education, in which fewer than 30 out of every 100 professionals are specifically qualified to attend to children. 27. In Cabo Verde, women make up 49% of the population, and have a greater life expectancy (80,7 years as opposed to 73,4 for men). They are more educated, meaning that they have an average of 8.7 years of schooling against 7.7 years for men, and have an average of 2.5 children over their lifetimes. Cabo Verde has made notable progress in the realm of gender equality, progress it would like to share with the international community. The mainstreaming of gender equality, especially in tourism, which makes the country unique in the world with its vision, facilitated by the level of detail and quality of official statistics, gender-sensitive budgeting with the intro- duction of gender markers in the budget system, the introduction of the gender equality module in secondary schooling, a first-of-its-kind challenge in Africa and in professional training courses, all make Cabo Verde a country of reference in Africa in terms of the mainstreaming of gender equality. The country ensures pregnant stu - dents remain in school while at the same time it works to counter violence in dating and teenage pregnancy. Various legislative measures accompany this gradual evolution toward equality. Gender-based violence is a crime that has been given priority in terms of prevention, and is legally considered a public crime. Indeed, Cabo Verde's gen - der-based violence law is considered one of the most advanced in the world, with the criminal code making it mandatory for those aware of incidents to report them to authorities and impossible for criminal complaints to be retracted. The number of cases of gender-based violence fell, and specialized courts to hear gender-based violence-related cases were created, as were shelters with specialized professionals to assist victims operating in all of the country's municipalities. Cabo Verde made history with the approval of the Gender Parity Law, which completely changed the scenario of women's representation in deci - sion-making positions. Women represent 48% of management positions, a figure much higher than the world averages of 27%, and this is expected to improve further with the Gender Parity Law. According to the World Bank study \"Women, Business and Laws 2021,\" Cabo Verde is in 4th place in Africa in terms of the best indicators in the realm of labor legislation. The country has also just been elected as a member 22of the commission of women's status for 2022-2026. 28. Cabo Verde is working to implement a care system to liberate women in order to participate in other public spheres. The country has a strategy to accelerate the transition from the informal sector so that women can be at the center of the post- Covid economic recovery, and is about to move forward with increases in maternity and paternity leave for new parents. As such, out ambition is a Cabo Verde without gender discrimination, promoting women's economic opportunities, stimulating diver - sified educational and professional paths, expanding equal participation of women and men in power and decision-making spaces and positions and developing policies and measures to eliminate all forms of gen - der-based violence. We are committed to promoting economic empowerment, labor equality and integration through education and professional training, expanding wom- en's participation in politics and decision making, and, especially, combating gen - der-based violence. 29. In the past 5 years, Cabo Verde has seen notable progress in the realm of water and sanitation, despite three consecutive years of drought. This progress is sub - stantiated in the reform of the sector and, particularly, the corporatization of water and sanitation services, which has resulted in gains both for consumers and in terms of the management of solid urban waste. This performance reflects the importance attributed by Cabo Verdean authorities to the mobilization and distribution of water for domestic consumption and in the economy, particularly over the past 5 years. We are aware that the negative impacts of climate change condition and considerably aggravate the availability of and access to basic envi - ronmental benefits and services and that, in the realm of water, the country continues to face major challenges in the reduction of economic losses, which merit our utmost attention. 30. The proportion of the population that obtains its drinking water in a safe man - ner has grown. The country has reached a per capita running water domestic con - sumption level of 43.1 liters per day and has surpassed the target set in the PLE - NAS for 2030. Technical losses have also been reduced and total volume of water mobilized increased. In seven of the nine inhabited islands, water and sanitation ser - vice operators were created. The country has modern legislation for the sector, and 23 sectorial planning instruments have been the object of wide-reaching consensus in their elaboration and implementation. The vast majority of the population uses safe sanitation systems, and the volume of water that is collected and treated has increased significantly. Cabo Verde's authorities have reiterated their commitment to ensuring the availability and sustainable management of drinking water and sanitation for all, and, as such, will invest in improving the busi - ness environment in order to attract private investment in the expansion of the mobi - lization and distribution capacity of water for domestic consumption and in economic activities aimed at improving the quality of services and expanding the number of those benefiting from water, sanitation and solid urban waste services. 31. The country has made notable progress in the domain of energy, and by the end of the current year we expect to achieve the SDG target regarding electricity access rates. We have adopted and implemented special electricity tariffs for socially disadvantaged consumers. We have reduced the frequency and average duration of service interruptions and increased efficiency in the operation of electricity services, with a consequent reduction in losses. We are, however, still faced with the need to build the sector's conditions of resilience and sustainability, combating the high level of non-technical losses and improving operational efficiency in the production, transportation and dis - tribution of electricity. We have adopted programs for the dignified consumption of electricity for poor households. 81 of every 100 households use butane for cooking. The production of renewable energy also con - tinues to grow. In 2018, Cabo Verde adopted the 2018-2040 Electrical Sector Master Plan, calling for a 53.5% renewable energy penetration rate in 2030, and the Electri- cal Mobility Charter and plan of action for the operationalization and introduction of electrical mobility foresees the substitution of virtually all thermal motors in vehicles with electrical motors by 2050. We have invested in capacity building with profes - sional training and internships in this realm. We host the ECOWAS Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) and have improved energy efficiency overall. Cabo Verdean authorities have reinforced their commitment to ensure access to reliable, sustainable and modern sources of energy for all, and as such have invested in accelerating the energy transition and in decarbonizing the country's economy. 32. In these past 5 years, real per capita GDP has dropped some 0.7% due to the 14.8% economic recession that took place in 2020, which explains, to a large degree, the increase in poverty in the population. The real GDP per employed person grew on average only 1.3% a year, while the aver - age annual growth of the Cabo Verdean economy was approximately 4.7%, which is in itself insufficient for the expansion of employment, but the country did see gains in productivity in the first 4 years of this cycle, all of which was, however, destroyed in 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the marked characteristics of the labor market in Cabo Verde is its informality, which remains predominant in agriculture but has diminished and which, outside of the agricultural sector, affects men more than women. In Cabo Verde, men dedicate more time to paid work than women. 33. In the last pre-crisis year (2019), the employed population was predominantly male and worked in the tertiary sector, while the unemployed population was also mostly male, with a secondary schooling level. The underemployed population, however, was divided equally between the two genders, and was indeed predominant in urban areas in the 15- to 34-year-old age group with elementary schooling. In general, women are at a disadvantage in the labor market and constitute the majority of NEET youth. A total of 19,718 jobs were lost in 2020, espe - cially in urban areas, and the unemployment rate rose, especially among men. 34. As per the terms of the Cabo Verde Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda for the 2030 horizon, we are striving to achieve the dignified work agenda in order to reach full employment and reduce the unemployment rate to levels of no more than 5% by 2030 with relative parity. We also aim to reduce the youth unemployment rate to approximately 11% and the proportion of young people NEET to 5%. Tourism remains the country's leading sector, but we have taken up the challenge of diversifying the economy. As such, the bulk of new jobs will be generated by catalytic sectors - in other words, the blue economy, which is expected to become the second-largest anchor of the Cabo Verdean economy, the digital economy, industry in order to expand exports, smart 24agriculture, the international health platform and the cultural and creative industries sec - tor. We hope to achieve a minimum coverage of 80% of workers covered by social security with the expansion of hard-to-cover groups, namely by accelerating the transition from the informal to the formal economy, and business development. 35. Investments in roads have an important impact on poverty reduction and on improving the quality of life of the popu - lation. We have densified the national and municipal road network, and much of this network has undergone a wide-reaching rehabilitation and modernization program, which took place alongside an important program for the construction of new roads, and have improved accessibility to pre - viously isolated zones. The circulation of transportation vehicles and increased con - siderably, and we improved domestic and international connectivity, a dynamic that was, however, interrupted by the pandemic. Cabo Verde is a service economy par excel - lence, and, as such, the relative weight of the manufacturing industry is still relatively modest in terms of wealth creation, for the sector has a per capita GVA of some US$ 239 in terms of employment. In addition to its relatively low carbon footprint, Cabo Verde has worked consistently to transform its economy from fossil fuels to renewable energies. 36. Investment in research is still incipient, with world leader South Korea, for exam- ple, investing 31.6 times more per capita than Cabo Verde. Access to information and communication technologies through mobile network coverage and, especially, home internet connections, has increased, however. In Cabo Verde, the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the infrastructure sector, but a positive one on some industries, such as pharmaceuticals and apparel. The production of desalinated water and electricity, however, fell, while the cost of these production factors rose. Water and electricity theft increased, while the payment capacity of households affected by the pandemic fell drastically. Throughout the industrial sector there was a significant reduction in the work force. CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions fell, and there was a reorientation in terms of research, with studies related the pandemic and its impacts being given priority. Digital connectivity went up with the pandemic, with remote working and education, which helped accelerate the achievement of one of the government's priorities. Cabo Verdean authorities have strengthened their commitment to resilient infrastructures, inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation. 37. Cabo Verdean authorities have rein - forced knowledge of, political responsibility for and planning in the realm of housing with a new profile for the housing sector in Cabo Verde, a new housing policy and the 2020-2030 National Housing Plan. Reforms have been carried out in the domain or terri - torial management in Cabo Verde, while the legal framework regarding the Land Registry and the functioning and data processing of the Property Information, Management and Transaction System has been enhanced. Non-traditional housing, such as shanties, informal settlements or inadequate housing, is almost non-existent in Cabo Verde. The country is served by a good network of national and municipal roads, as well as a fleet of passenger transport vehicles in good condition, giving the majority of the popula - tion safe and easy access to transportation. Most cities are relatively small, meaning that internal mobility does not depend on the availability of public transportation which is, nevertheless, of high quality, reliability, safety and comfort in the country's two largest urban areas, Praia and Mindelo. Inter-urban transportation is carried out by minibuses and, to a lesser degree, mixed purpose vehicles, especially to zones not served by paved or cobblestone roads. 38. No Cabo Verdean city, however, has adapted mobility systems for disabled individuals, and architectural barriers seri- ously limit access. Until 2019, the circula - tion of passenger transportation vehicles increased continuously, but this dynamic was interrupted by the pandemic. The largest investments ever in the restoration of architectural heritage sites classified as such by the Institute of Cultural Patrimony were made over the past 5 years. The quantity of dangerous waste deposited in the urban waste collection systems fell by 0.5%. Both crimes against persons and the sexual abuse of minors fell during the same period. All of Cabo Verde's 24 cities have urban master plans. 39. In 2017, Cabo Verde adopted the 2017- 2030 National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy, made operational by the Strate-25 gic Sustainable Development Plan (SSDP) through the \"Environmental, Geological and Climate Risk Management\" program and, alongside it, the \"Biodiversity and Environ - mental Quality Conservation\" program. The enhancement of the legal framework and its integration in local development planning instruments has also been given priority. 40. The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on the housing sector, on invest - ments in the road network, on the con - servation and preservation of historic sites and on solid waste management, and the increase in the use of health equipment such as masks, gloves, gels, plastic con - tainers, medical devices, electric and elec - tronic equipment and chemical products for tests presents emerging challenges for the management of solid wastes. Also, during the pandemic, the number of criminal com - plaints and occurrences registered by the Judiciary Police fell, although anti-property crimes (thefts and robberies), gender-based violence, cybercrimes related to computer, credit and debit card fraud, and crimes against honor committed through computers all saw an increase. 41. The country's level of dependency on the importation of food products and the level of social inequality make wasting food particularly ill-advised. Health monitoring and safety measures have been adopted and are mandatorily implemented by busi- ness owners in order to limit the spread of COVID-19. In recent years, the country has embarked on an ambitious transition to a zero-carbon economy with the adoption in 2019 of the 2018-2040 Electrical Sector Master Plan, which focuses on the country's transition to a decarbonized economy. In Cabo Verde, businesses are not obliged to publish sustainability reports, but many are sensitive to sustainability issues. 42. Sustainable public acquisitions are provided for in the country's legal frame - work and are practiced when required by partners such as the World Bank, but the practice needs to be enhanced. Education on citizens' rights and responsibilities is now a part of school curricula, but these do not yet specifically include education for sustainable development. IN 2019, the Government of Cabo Verde adopted the Major Priorities of the Strategic Tourism Development Plan (GOPEDTS - Turismo), which focuses on sustainable development, and most of the resources from the Tourism Fund were invested in urban requalification in order to increase the country's attrac - tiveness as a tourist destination, as well as in solving housing problems on the islands of Sal and Boa Vista and in tourist safety. 43. Cabo Verdean authorities are aware of the climate emergency in which the world currently finds itself, and have called for responsible attitudes and respect for current and future generations. They are aware that climate change is now a reality and has an undeniable impact, and that Cabo Verde is particularly exposed to the negative impacts thereof, which will most likely result in an increase in the frequency and gravity of hydro-meteorological risks and the possible increase in the sea level. Authorities are also aware that Cabo Verde must prepare, creating resilience that can allow it to deal with the phenomena asso - ciated with these changes. We have ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and in 2017, as one if its signatories, presented our Third National Communication on Climate Change. We have mainstreamed measures related in climate change in national policies, strategies and plans in the education, energy and agricul - tural sectors, as well as in the 2017-2020 SSDP, with the alignment of partners such as the United Nations. 44. In recent decades, Cabo Verde has seen important progress in its climate strategy, integrating environmental issues in elementary, secondary and university curricula, and recently presenting the 2nd Determined National Contribution. In 2017 we adopted the 2017-2030 National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy, made operational by the SSDP through the \"Environmental, Geological and Climate Risk Management\" program and, alongside it, the \"Biodiversity and Environmental Quality Conservation\" program. 45. We have begun municipal-level risk assessments and elaborated a Post-Di - saster Recovery Framework, while some municipalities' Municipal Strategic Sustain - able Development Plans have taken in a disaster risk approach. We have enhanced communication and dissemination in schools and communities, and prepared the emer - gency response plan with the support of the World Bank. A project is also under way to build our emergency response capacity. 2646. 45. We are developing a legal Framework and, with the support of UNESCO, preparing a flood and drought early warning system aimed at creating resilience to respond to the impacts associated with risks and natural disasters. As a Small Island Develop - ing State, Cabo Verde benefits from support to raise its capacity in terms of planning and management related to climate change, as well as its capacity to adapt to the adverse impacts thereof, namely from the UNDP, Japan, Luxemburg, UNIDO and FAO. 47. The past 5 years have been characterized by Cabo Verdean authorities' strong commit- ment to climate resilience. Within the scope, we are currently elaborating the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan. The COVID- 129 pandemic had a negative impact on the implementation of measures aimed at preserving priority species. Cabo Verde will invest in agricultural, forestry and grazing resilience in order to meet the challenge, during this decade, of promoting the condi - tions allowing the country to minimize the impacts of climate change. It will invest in improving climate governance and in main - streaming climate change in its policies, plans and strategies, and will implement an effective institutional coordination model between government structures on multiple levels, as well as articulation with other sectors liable to have an influence or impact on resilience to climate change. 48. The sea represents 99% of our territory and is a strategic resource for development. As such, it must urgently be transformed into one of the main anchors for the development, diversification and specialization of the Cabo Verdean economy. Water eutrophication is highly localized in Cabo Verde in a number of bays, but is overall not very expressive from an environmental point of view. Our Exclusive Economic Zone totals 740,000 Km\u00b2 and represents an immense asset. Fishing activities in coastal and archipelagic waters are reserved for Cabo Verdeans, and are authorized in the country's EEZ through licenses issued by the competent authorities and/or through bilateral fishing accords. 49. Effectively speaking, the management of Cabo Verde's EEZ is carried out through ecosystem-based approaches. The average acidity of sea water is pH 8-8.3, which coin - cides with the general average of oceans worldwide, and Cabo Verdean authorities have not experienced or detected any acid event in our Exclusive Economic Zone. Protected marine areas total 149,598.95 ha, the equivalent of 6.6% of the country's territorial waters. Research in the realm of maritime technology had been made a priority in the allocation of resources, and the Government of Cabo Verde is currently implementing what is known as the Ocean Campus (Campus do Mar), which includes the Technical University of the Atlantic (UTA), the Institute of the Sea (IMAR) and the School of the Sea (EMAR). 50. Cabo Verde has developed and approved governing instruments for the transition from the maritime economy to the blue economy - in other words, the Policy Charter for the Blue Economy, the Unified Blue Economy Strategic Framework, the National Plan for the Blue Economy and the Blue Economy Promotion Program. The blue economy is regarded as \"a sustainable and inclusive blue economy aimed at opti- mizing economic, social and environmental benefits.\" The Government of Cabo Verde is seeking new mechanisms for financing its blue economy transition process and, in addition to existing mechanisms such as the Climate Fund, among others, Cabo Verdean authorities are looking into the possibility of negotiating debt relief or the reconversion of public debt into investment and implementation of its main blue econ - omy transition instruments. 51. The surface area with woody plant cover represents 23% of Cabo Verde's and territory, with some 50 species and 1 sup-species. Of this total, 14.9% are agroforestry zones and 12.5% are open forest zones, while protected areas make up 18.2% of the country's total land area. The classification of the islands of Maio and Fogo as UNESCO World Biosphere Reserves is one of the results of biodiversity and environmental conservation actions, as was the international Melina Mercouri award, attributed by UNESCO to Cova/Pa\u00fal/ Ribeira da Torre Natural Park in Santo Ant\u00e3o in 2019, in addition to the international \"Terras Sem Sombras\" award granted to Cabo Verde's Botanical Garden, created and managed by the National Agrarian Research and Development Institute (INIDA), in the category of Biodiversity Safeguarding in 2020. 52. Sustainable forestry management is one of the hallmarks of Cabo Verde's 45 years as an independent country. The country's first red list on threatened species dates back to 1997 and indicates that some 20% of all 27 species are in danger of extinction, and that the increase in the number of threatened species is probable given the situation of a country with poor flora and fauna biodiver - sity. Cabo Verde has an invasive plants spe - cies management strategy for the forested zones of the country's Natural Parks and has implemented actions aimed at the gradual elimination thereof and the occupation of the respective areas with endemic species. The Aichi Biodiversity Targets have been fully integrated into Cabo Verde's develop- ment process through the SSDP by way of the Biodiversity and Environmental Quality Conservation Program. 53. Cabo Verde has made notable progress with regards to the mainstreaming of eco- system and biodiversity values in national and local planning. The non-existence of a Biodiversity Observatory and of a solid sta - tistical information base that would allow for the effective accompaniment and monitoring of indicators, however, makes it difficult to precisely determine the true state of biodi - versity in the country. Nevertheless, in spite of these shortcomings, inquiries carried out along with local partners reveal that in the islands where the creation of Protected Areas has been implemented, biodiversity is in a better state of conservation. 54. Strong systems and institutions con - stitute an essential part of the foundations of accelerators of sustainable development. Security and justice are sectors that have been the object of particular attention on the part of Cabo Verdean authorities, and we are currently seeing a downswing in violence, in crimes against persons and intentional homicide, and an improvement in access to justice. These past five years were profoundly characterized by progress in terms of justice, peace, good governance, partnerships, the consolidation of demo - cratic institutions and the reinforcement of conditions of stability, but also in terms of long-term commitments for sustain - able development. However, studies and National Police data reveal the persistence of physical, psychological and sexual violence against women, particularly by current or former partners. 55. Most 18-year-olds questioned affirmed they had never felt unsafe walking through their neighborhood, and the perception of lack of safety is higher among women and in urban areas. There is no record of cases related to human trafficking crimes in the last 12 months, and there is no data avail - able on the total amount of illicit financial inflows and outflows, but the country has a legal and institutional framework consistent with its money laundering risk profile. The number of arrests for the illegal possession of weapons is inexpressive. 56. Cabo Verde is able to ensure proper primary expenditure forecasts and exe - cution. Although the role of the National Assembly and of municipal governments is unquestionable, there is a need to fine- tune proximity with the population through improved management of expectations in a country where some 31% of the population still lives in a situation of absolute poverty. The late registration of children after birth is a challenge that has been overcome, and in Cabo Verde press freedom is internationally recognized. Indeed, in the past five years, the members of the independent board of directors of Cabo Verde's National Radio and Television Broadcaster were appointed without the interference of the government for the first time in the holding company's history. The National Human Rights and Citizenship Commission, which was created in 2004, is an independent Cabo Verdean human rights institution. We follow inter - national best practices when we faced the COVID-19 pandemic, making the health care, economic and social emergencies resulting from it the center of our priorities, and we protected the health of Cabo Verdeans, saved lives and protected businesses, jobs and incomes, informal workers and families. The COVID-19 pandemic did not result in structural changes in the legal framework of the public finance management system, but some temporary organizational, pro - cedural and work agenda alterations and adjustments were made. 57. Beginning in 2016, we ushered in a new era in the relationship between cen- tral and local government, opting for trust, dialogue and complementarity, while we increased the amount of resources allocated to municipal governments, leading local development to take on a never-before-seen dynamic, thus creating complicity between local and central powers, to the joy of Cabo Verde's citizens. We implemented Local Development Platforms for the local imple - mentation of SDGs, which is a mechanism and a best practice for localizing the SDGs in Cabo Verde. Firm steps were taken in Public Administration reform, and we ushered in 28a new era in the relationship between the government and civil society organizations. 58. The financing of sustainable develop- ment and partnerships, along with connec - tivity, safety and strong systems and insti - tutions, constitute the context that makes the accelerators of sustainable development viable. With the resumption in economic growth in 2016 and the improvement in the efficiency of tax administration, by 2019 tax revenues had grown and the financing of the State Budget was reinforced through taxes within the context of a reduction in official development assistance, but, as is the case with most other SIDS, foreign direct investment fell, while remittances from \u00e9migr\u00e9s grew and the public debt/GDP ratio was reduced. With the exception of \u00e9migr\u00e9 remittances, the gains had in terms of tax revenues, financing through taxes and budget consolidation were erased by the COVID-19 pandemic. 59. Cabo Verde has a dense and advanced investment promotion system and a strong network of partners in the realm of sci - ence and technology. Broadband internet subscription rates are high and most Cabo Verdeans use the internet in their homes, especially young people. The economy grew an average of 4.7% between 2016 and 2019, but went into recession in 2020 (-14.8%), voiding the gains of the governing cycle in terms of growth in national wealth. After a period on the downswing, unemployment rose in 2020 with the elimination of 9% of all jobs, and the young NEET population rose to levels higher than those seen in 2015. Net international reserves grew to a point at which they now are sufficient to ensure, in 2020, some 7.8 months of imports, we managed to maintain exchange rate stability and the current account deficit maintained a downward trajectory in terms of public finances, a trend toward consolidation inter - rupted in 2020 because of the COVID-29 pandemic, leading the public debt to reach 154.9% of GDP. 60. In Cabo Verde, the SDGs are made operational through the SSDPs, and the next SSDP will have as its essential references the Cabo Verde Strategic Sus- tainable Development Agenda and the 10th Legislature Government Program. An SDG Implementation Coordination Mechanism was established and approved by the government and its partners, and will be made into law. This mechanism will be facilitated by advances in the Monitoring and Evaluation System in its legal, information system and institutional aspects. 61. Cabo Verde complies with the Funda - mental Principles of Official Statistics, the development of which is planned by aligning priorities with the SSDP and the SDGs. We have successful experience carrying out population censuses every 10 years, and this month we are carrying out the 2021 Census. The challenges of Cabo Verde's sustainable development are collective, and the implementation of the SDGs is not the exclusive task of the State, but rather a collective responsibility whose success is largely a consequence of the participation of the various different stakeholders - in other words, in addition to public authorities, the participation of the private sector, civil society, the academic world, the diaspora and development partners, but also the pardoning, at least in part, of the foreign debt, including as an alternative to financing and partnership within the scope of the next SSDP. 29 INTRODUCTION Located in the Atlantic Ocean, about 550 km off the west African coast, Cabo Verde is a small country, comprising 10 islands and 13 islets, with an area of 4,033 km\u00b2 and an Exclusive Economic Zone that covers approximately 734,265 km\u00b2. The islands of Santo Ant\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Vicente, Santa Luzia, S\u00e3o Nicolau, Sal and Boa Vista make up the Barlavento group and the southern islands, namely Maio, Santiago, Fogo and Brava, make up the Sotavento group. The morphological and geological characteristics vary greatly from island to island, the relief is generally very steep on mountainous islands, culminating in high altitudes, such as 2,829 meters in Fogo and 1,979 meters in Santo Ant\u00e3o. The average temperature is 23.5\u00b0C, with three seasons a year, that is, the dry season, from March to June, the rainy season, from July to October, with heavy and sporadic rains, and the transition season, from November to February The resident population is about 556,900 inhabitants, of which about 51% are male and 49% are female, relatively young, as 64 out of 100 individuals are under 35 years old. The country's young population has been losing ground to the elderly population, which may account for 53% of the total in 2030. About 8.7% of the population is 60 or older, which will be about 12.3% in 2030 and aging is expected to accelerate from that year onwards. Santiago is the largest island in size and the most populated, with about 56% of the population, and with S\u00e3o Vicente makes up about 72% of the resident population. Growing on average around 1.1% a year, the resident population is expected to reach 621,141 inhabitants in 2030. Cabo Verde is in full demographic transi - tion, with a Synthetic Fertility Index of 2.5 children per woman, a low level of infant mortality or around 15.6 per 1,000 live births and overall or 5.0 per thousand inhabitants, and , therefore, a high life expectancy of about 77 years old. According to the Cabo Verde Demographic Dividend Profile, the window for the 1st Demographic Dividend opened around 1982 and may close around 2070, so it is a priority to intensify and improve the coordination of public poli - cies, especially before 2030, in order to reap maximum benefits from the population's age structure, - in other words, to make employment grow at a level much higher than the population growth rate and, above all, to promote the qualification of human capital in order to increase productivity. Education has been a national objective since independence, which is why we have a a literacy rate for the 15-and-older population of approximately 88.5%, a rate that reaches 98.8% among the young population. Thanks also to successful progress in the health field, we have a vaccination coverage of 95.8% against BCG, 97.6% against polio and 97.0% against pentavalent. We introduced the HPV vaccine in the national vaccination calendar and started vaccination against COVID-19 aiming to reach at least 70% of the population in the current year and overall coverage in 2022. According to IDSR III, the seropreva - lence rate for HIV1 in the 15 - to 49-year-old population is 0.4%, standing at 0.6% among women and 0.2% among men. When HIV2 is included, the seroprevalence rate stands at 0.6%, with 0.7% among women and 0.4% among men. About 54.6% of women in union and 51.0% of women who do not live in union use a modern method of contraception. The housing deficit stands at 11,100 households and added to this is a more serious problem of insecurity - that is, at least 25,535 homes of poor households are in degraded conditions. At least 69% of the population lives in households connected to the public water distribution network, 85 out of every 100 residents live in accommodations with sanitary facilities and about 82.4% of the population use a safe sanitation system, - in other words, lives in accommodations with sanitary facilities connected to a septic tank (52.9%, or to a sewer system 29.6%, while 81% of the population disposes of solid waste properly or places it in garbage containers. The population's access to electricity is wide - spread, as some 92.2% of the population has access to electricity from the public network, and the vast majority of the population (78.3%) uses mainly gas for cooking food. About 67.0% of the population has access to internet at home and at least 71.7% of Cabo Verdeans aged 10 or over have at least one mobile phone. At least 61.9% of the population of the same age group uses the internet, and especially 75.4 and 90.2% of young people aged 15-24 and 25-34 respec - tively use this global network. According to INE estimates, around 13.1% of the population is poor. Absolute poverty is more prevalent in rural areas, where it affects 24.3% of the population. About 43.1% 30of the poor population lives in urban areas. In Cabo Verde women constitute 49.7% of the poor population. Nevertheless, Cabo Verdean authorities always use poverty data according to the national poverty line for the adoption of public policies and planning and the implementation thereof. Based on poverty data using the national poverty line, in 2020 there were 175,844 poor people in Cabo Verde - in other words, persons living on less than US$ 2.77 a day, the equivalent of 31.6% of the population. Some 31.2% of men and 32% of women are poor. With a GDP per capita of US$3,600 and US$ 3,059 in 2019 and 2020, respectively, Cabo Verde has a services economy, the tertiary sector representing around 61.2% of GDP (real) and 66.1% of employment, while in 2019 revenues reached some 21.8% of the national wealth, a figure that, however, fell to 7.8% in 2020. Strongly anchored to the euro zone, origin of most imported goods as well as tourists, Cabo Verde has an exchange cooperation agree - ment with the euro zone that guarantees the convertibility of the escudo, which is the national currency. In 2020, the economy suffered a 14.8% recession, the unemployment rate reached 14.5%, international reserves were equivalent to 7.8 months of imports, the global balance was fixed at -8.8% of GDP and public debt stood at approximately 154.9% of GDP. Independent since July 5, 1975, in 1991 Cabo Verde made the transition to a democratic regime, after fifteen years of one-party rule. The Movement for Democracy - MPD won the first free and multi-party elections, which consummated the end of the First Republic and the beginning of the Second, having this party governing the country for the next 10 years. In 2001, 2006 and 2011, the PAICV won the legislative elections and in 2016 there was another political alternation, with the MPD winning the 2016 legislative elections, a feat repeated in 2021 with the MpD governing with an absolute majority. In 1992, the first municipal elections were held, the eighth having taken place on October 25 2020, marking the beginning of a new municipal cycle with 14 municipalities governed by the MpD and 8 by the PAICV. The contribution of the local government to qualify the people's vote and promote political participation, the expansion of the space for action of the media was decisive. After a remarkable path towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, we are one of the signatory countries of the 31 Sustainable Development Goals. Although in the case of the MDGs, which started in 1990, we only took the bandwagon in 2000, we participated in the construction of the SDGs which visibly permeated the Government Program of the IX Legislature and, consequently, the 2017-2021 Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (PEDS), which is in line with that universal agenda. Aware that most of the SDGs imply strong action by local government, have reinforced trust, dialogue and complementarity in the central government's relationship with local government. We have implemented the Platforms for Local Development and SDG localization and the Municipalities have equipped themselves with Municipal Strategic Plans for Sustainable Develop - ment, aligned with the PEDS and the SDGs, mechanisms par excellence for localizing the SDGs and for qualifying the technical and political dialogue between the central and local authorities and other partners as well as for for accelerating sustainable develop - ment. The entire public finance management system is result-oriented and integrates the SDGs as a reference for managing and controlling expenditure execution. The 2030 Agenda is thus duly integrated into the stra - tegic development planning and management instruments at both local and central levels. In 2018, the Government of Cabo Verde produced the first Voluntary Review on the implementation of the Sustainable Develop - ment Goals. Carried out by the Government of Cabo Verde, in close partnership with the United Nations, the Second Voluntary National Report on the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda is an instrument to assess the country's progress, allowing us to revisit our strategies, identify chal - lenges, share best practices and improve governance, with a view to accelerating the implementation of the SDGs and is thus a mechanism for reaffirming the country's long-term sustainable development com - mitments and strategies. Coordinated by the Ministry of Finance through the National Planning Directorate, the exercise involved public entities, United Nations specialists, as well as representa - tives of the civil society, the private sector, workers .....higher education institutions and the media. Prepared according to the methodological guidelines and best practices of the United Nations, the VNR has as its essential basis the PEDS Progress Report for the 2017-2020 period, which is the evi- dence base of the country's progress, Cabo Verde's 2030 Strategic Agenda for Sustainable Development, the COVID-19 Socio-Eco - nomic Impact Assessment and the \"Leave No One Behind\" assessment also serving as important sources of data. The exercise was conducted according to a roadmap and methodological guidelines developed by the National Directorate of Planning and conducted by working groups. The Government of Cabo Verde operationalizes its program and the SDGs through the PEDS, based on four structuring objectives: making Cabo Verde an economy of circulation in the Middle Atlantic; ensuring economic and environmental sustainability; ensuring social inclusion and the reduction of inequalities and asymmetries and; strengthen sovereignty, valuing democracy and directing diplomacy to the challenges of the country's development. The Government recognizes the need and major importance of adopting integrated policies in the field of the environment and as such the \"Conservation of biodiversity and environmental quality\" program, one of the PEDS programs, aims to ensure the sustainable management of environmental resources, ensure the enjoyment of environ - mental quality by the society, to enhance the valuation of the environment as an asset and a factor for the country's economic competitiveness ...with a view to achieving a balance between meeting current needs and the fair expectations of future generations. Gender equality is also one of the funda - mental principles of sustainable develop- ment and aims to ensure that women and girls, as well as men and boys, have the same opportunities to participate in, access and benefit from the development process. The mainstreaming of gender in the PEDS guarantees the adoption of corrective mea - sures for gender inequalities, at the level of the different sectors, thus promoting justice and social inclusion as well as the country's sustainable development. As mentioned earlier, the PEDS operationalizes the SDGs and is aligned with that agenda, Africa 2063 Agenda and Samoa Pathway. In line with the Addis Abebba Action Plan for financing sustainable development, thanks to the resumption and acceleration of economic growth up to the year immediately preceding the pandemic crisis year, tax revenues grew and the financing of the State Budget through 32taxes reached 76,8% in 2019. This growth, however, was interrupted due to the drop in revenues, which covered only 59.9% of the State Budget in 2020. The State of Cabo Verde prioritizes the promotion of foreign direct investment as a form of development financing, through the movement of capital that does not increase external indebtedness, reaching 7.6 of GDP in 2019 and 4.4% of GDP in 2020. Unlike the first, the 2021 VNR has the PEDS 2017-2020 Progress Report as its main source and thus the evidence base of the advances in the fulfillment of the SDGs. The participa - tion of different stakeholders in the progress evaluation of the PEDS and the SDGs was intense, broad and qualified, and through this we mobilized and created conditions for wide-reaching participation in the 2022-2026 PEDS and in the fulfillment of the SDGs. The 2021 VNR also takes ownership of the 2021 VLR and thus comprises the perspective of the SDGs at the local level, as well as highlighting the process, progress and effects of SDGs localizing. The 2021 VNR assesses progress highlighting the year 2019, in which the gains of 2016- 2021 cycle were most prominent, and the year 2020, in which there were losses of value, employment, well-being and time and during which we witnessed the destruction of an important portion of the gains that the country had achieved since 2016. This report is also based on recent data on poverty and inequalities and on the dynamics of these phenomena over the last 5 years. Carried out at the end of a government cycle, it also assesses the performance of the government and the country and a 5-year trajectory allows ...the successes and failures of negative and positive practices to be highlighted, in order to capitalize on the latter in the next cycles of governance and share with the community Internationall. Contrary to its predecessor, the 2021 VNR actively involved technicians and program managers from the National Planning Direc - torate and from line ministries and which afforded a vision of the potential of human resources, strengthening capacities and, in particular, increase the autonomy of the National Planning Directorate. The National Voluntary Review on the imple - mentation of the Sustainable Development Goals is a great opportunity for Cabo Verde to assess its path, address its challenges with the international community, validate its Cabo Verde's 2030 Strategic Agenda for Sustainable Development and to reaffirm its commitment to the sustainable development of these Atlantic Islands. 33 1. 2021 CABO VERDE VNR EXERCISE METHODOLOGY The Cabo Verde VNR 2021 exercise was pub - licly launched at a ceremony presided over by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and by the Coordinator of the United Nations System in Cabo Verde, responsible, respectively, for chairing and vice-chairing the exercise with the participation of the agencies of the United Nations, the National Directorate of Planning and other components of the National Planning System with wide dissemination in the media. In addition to the pronouncements of the Government and the United Nations, the main methodological guidelines, information sources and the road - map of the exercise were presented. The Voluntary National Review... on the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda is an instrument for evaluating the country's progress, reaffirming the country's com - mitments and long-term strategies for sustainable development. The second National Review on the Imple - mentation of the 2030 Agenda, 2021 Cabo Verde VNR, was prepared according to the methodological guidelines and best practices of the United Nations, having as an essential basis the 2017-2020 Progress Report of the PEDS, instrument through which the Government Program and the SDGs are operationalized. It also has as important sources the Cabo Verde 2030 Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda, the Integrated National Financing Frame - work (INFF), the COVID-19 Socio-Economic Impact Assessment and the \"Leave no one behind\" assessment. The preparation of the 2021 Cabo Verde VNR valued knowledge, evidence and strategic elements produced and discussed in the debates held within the scope of Cabo Verde Ambition 2030 exercise, on progress in sustainable development, on the shocks and losses caused by the COVID-19 pan - demic and above all the guidelines of Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda. It assessed the fulfillment of the commit - ments made in 2018, with the participation of United Nations specialists in Cabo Verde and, above all, it promoted a joint involve- ment and commitment of public, private and civil society entities that participated in the implementation of the SDGs and in this exercise, especially through PEDS 2017-2021 programs. The Government of Cabo Verde represented by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance instituted the 2021 Cabo Verde VNR exercise by Order No. 018/2021 of 12 February. As such, the 2021 Cabo Verde VNR... was prepared under the political coordination of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, assisted by the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Cabo Verde. Within the scope of political coordination, the Deputy Prime Minister ensured dialogue within the Government, chaired the launch of the exercise, approved the key message, chaired the conference on sustainable development, presented the final version of the document for approval by the Council of Ministers. 34In order to carry out the evaluation, analysis and write up, as well as the mobilization and communication, the Work Group chaired by the National Director of Planning was created by the aforementioned order, with the vice-chairmanship being ensured by the National Director of Political, Economic and Cultural Affairs (DNAPEC) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation and a representative of the United Nations System in Cabo Verde. The Working Group for the preparation of the 2021 VNR comprises an Evaluation, Analysis and Writing Sub-group and a Com - munication and Mobilization Sub-group. The Evaluation, Analysis and Writing Sub-group is chaired by the Director of the Strategic Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Service (DNP) and vice-chaired by a representative of the National Institute of Statistics and includes directors, technicians and Pro - gram Managers from the National Planning Directorate, leaders of Planning, Budget and Management of the various Ministries and other structures and agencies involved in the execution, monitoring and evaluation of PEDS 2017-2021, as well as representatives of Cabo Verde's NGO Platform, the Leeward Islands Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Services of Sotavento, the Barlavento Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Ser - vices, Cabo Verde's Chamber of Tourism and workers' representations. The Communication and Mobilization Subgroup is chaired by the Director of the Government's Office of Communication and Image, with the vice-chairmanship being ensured by the Deputy Prime Minister's Office of Communication. It integrates all the Government's Communication Advisors as well as the Communication Advisory of the United Nations System in Cabo Verde and the Cabo Verde Journalists Association. It will have the partnership of national media, both public and private.The preparation of the 2021 VNR had the technical assistance of a National Consultant, mobilized by the United Nations. Taking into account the marked trend of impoverishment, as an effect of the COVID19 pandemic, the National Statistics Institute carried out poverty estimates for the years 2015 to 2020, data that served in particular for the preparation of the reports on SDG 1 and 10 and in preparing the assessment \"Leave no one behind\". To carry out the 2021 Cabo Verde VNR exer - cise, the National Directorate of Planning prepared the roadmap, the methodological guidelines, the annotated plan of the 2021 Cabo Verde VNR..., the PEDS 2017-2020 Progress Report, plan and the constitution of the working groups for the reports, instru - ments that were discussed and validated in the first working meeting of the Evaluation, Analysis and Writing Sub-Group. The Evaluation Analysis and Writing Sub-Group benefited from training guided by UNECA. Under the presidency of this team, several actions of mobilization, information, and methodological guidance were carried out. In Cabo Verde, the Sustainable Development Goals are operationalized by the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (PEDS) in line with the SDGs. PEDS 2022-2026 will have as essential references the Cabo Verde Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda and the Government Program of the 10th Legislature. The advances in the PEDS constitute evidence of the advances in the SDGs. The reports of PEDS programs were 35 prepared by the working groups under the coordination of the National Directorate of Planning and discussed and validated in 19 thematic fora focusing on the 29 PEDS 2017- 2021 programs, the SDGs they implement and the impetus for their realization with the active, effective and broad participation of various stakeholders, namely the United Nations System, Higher Education Institu - tions, the private sector, but with significant participation of Civil Society Organizations, professional orders and the media. The validation of the advances of the PEDS in the 2017-2020 period, in line with the SDGs, as a source of evidence on the coun - try's progress in achieving this agenda, was carried out through 19 thematic forums on the reports of the main PEDS programs with 286 participations. These dealt with the general objectives of the programs and the link to the SDGs and respective contribu - tion, the specific objectives and the overall balance and perspectives of the program. For each specific objective, the balance of the deliveries of products (goods and ser - vices), the goals and even the possibilities of achieving in 2021 the final goals of the PEDS and the SDGs were discussed, as well as the relevant facts that hindered or facilitated their fulfillment, the structural changes that took place, namely, the main measures and policies adopted, the struc - tural sectorial reforms carried out and the transformative projects implemented. The thematic fora commented on the possibility of achieving the general objective of the program, the mobilization of resources, leadership and others or institutional solu -tions that facilitate, hinder or compromise the implementation of the program and thus and thus conditioned the progress of the SDGs. They also address the perspectives for the continuation of the program, changes or reinforcements in terms of mobiliza - tion of resources, human and institutional resources and the partnership of the various stakeholders. Linkage with the Cabo Verde Voluntary Local Review In 2021, Cabo Verde joins the group of coun- tries invited by the global organization of local authorities United Cities and Local Govern - ments (UCLU) to present a Voluntary Local Review (VLR). VLRs allow local authorities to supplement information being provided at the national level by VNRs. They also per - mit mutual sharing and learning with other local authorities, strengthening the sense of community and destiny and joint ownership that sustain the SDGs. Cabo Verde's VLR was carried out by a National Consultant involving 4 volunteer municipalities - S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os, Santa Cruz, Maio, Mosteiros, which represent 3 of the 9 inhabited islands of Cabo Verde, the islands of Santiago, Maio and Fogo. This exercise was carried out in collaboration with the National Directorate of Planning of the Ministry of Finance, the National Association of Cabo Verdean Municipalities (ANMCV) and the United Nations System in the country. In this context, work sessions were held with the ANMCV Focal Point, the ANMCV General Secretary and the Focal Points of the 6 Municipalities participating in the exercise on the localization of the SDGs and their progress. Implementation of the mobilization and com - munication strategy The Mobilization and Communication Subgroup ensured the mobilization of the various entities for the thematic forums for the discussion of the PEDS and SDG program reports, and organized the public (interactive) presentation of the 2021 Cabo Verde VNR with the participation of part - ners and Cabo Verdean civil society more broadly. It held the \"Cabo Verdean Busi - nesses and the SDGs Week\" to assess the performance of Cabo Verdean companies in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, encourage companies to commit to the Sustainable Development of Cabo Verde and develop their sustainability plan based on their own goals aligned with the SDGs. It produced audiovisual materials to present Cabo Verde's best practices in the pursuit of the SDGs and promoted dissemination in national and international media, social networks and other digital platforms. It mobilized elementary schools for SDGs, aiming their elaboration and participation and at national level of a competition called \"SDGs mural in Schools\" in the last week of the 2020/2021 school year.362. POLICIES AND FACILITATING ENVIRONMENT a). INSTITUTION aL aRRaNGEMENTS Since 2016, Cabo Verde has installed all the necessary architecture for the full integration of the SDGs in public policies and strategic plans and, at the same time, their promotion within civil society, for the full ownership of the 2030 Agenda by the Government, the private sector and the population. In 2020, the Cabo Verde Ambition 2030 exercise was carried out with broad participation from public entities, civil society, the private sector, academia, the diaspora, development partners, and, in particular, external partners such as the United Nations, the World Bank and the AfDB, and is part of Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda. At the national level, and in terms of hori- zontal coordination, the Council of Ministers played an essential role in the construction of public policies aligned with the 2030 Agenda. At the local level, and in terms of vertical coordination or multilevel gover - nance, Cabo Verde installed Local Platforms for the Localization of the 2030 Agenda, which bring together municipalities, State representatives at the local level, civil soci - ety organizations, Universities and private sector entities to coordinate local sustain- able development processes.The Implementation Coordination Mecha - nism was established in the SDG Roadmap approved by the Government at the end of 2019. It is essentially based on valuing the role of the National Planning System, the National Statistical System and Government decision-making bodies, it is part of the Sustainable Development of Cabo Verde 2030 Strategic Agenda and will be approved by the National Parliament. It is a powerful monitoring and evaluation mechanism. The Implementation Coordination Mecha - nism will be politically guided by the Prime Minister, namely through the Council of Ministers, which takes or submits to Parlia - ment the strategic and executive decisions that guarantee the implementation of the Strategic Agenda and the path towards the SDGs. It will be assisted by the Minister of Finance, who is responsible for planning and budgeting, as well as resource mobilization, together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Communities. For this purpose, the Center for Intelligence and Public Policies will be created. The Implementation Coordination Mech - anism comprises a Permanent High-Level Multisectoral Forum as an intersectoral and interministerial Steering Committee, including local authorities, academia, the private sector, civil society organizations, the Budget Support Group (GAO) and representatives of the Nations United. The Ministry of Finance, through the National Directorate of Planning, performs the secretariat functions and will be techni - 37 cally supported by the National Statistics Institute (INE) in carrying out monitoring, follow-up and review functions, including the preparation of periodic reports such as the Voluntary National Review and update of the SDG Scoreboard for Cabo Verde. The Implementation Coordination Mech - anism includes Ambition 2030 and SDG Thematic Working Groups, as multi-sec - toral and multi-institutional platforms that promote technical engagement, advocacy, contribute to facilitating access to finance and implement actions to meet the SDGs in Cabo Verde. The Thematic Working Groups have as essential reference Cabo Verde's Stra - tegic Sustainable Development Agenda Representatives of the relevant units of the Ministry of Finance, such as the National Directorate of Planning, in which the PEDS Program Managers work, and the National Directorate of Budget and Public Accounting, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, such as the National Direc - torate of Economic and Political and Cultural Affairs (DNAPEC), Supervisory Authorities such as the Court of Auditors, the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (ARAP),, the General Inspectorate of Finance and the Financial Information Unit (UIF), entities that should ensure the development of SDG audit capacities and performance audits in rele - vant SDG areas. Thematic Working Groups also integrate the National Association of Cabo Verdean Municipalities (ANMCV). The Ambition 2030 and SDG Thematic Working Groups include Civil Society representatives, NGOs and, in particular, representatives of the youth, women and trade unions. They include representatives from the private sector, investment promoting institutions, commercial banks, the Stock Exchange, the Superior Council of Chambers of Commerce, the Cabo Verde Chamber of Tourism, the Association of Young Entrepreneurs, the Association of Women Entrepreneurs, the General Directorate for Telecommunications and Digital Economy, the National Direc - torate for Industry, Trade and Energy, Cabo Verde TradeInvest, the Special Maritime Economic Zone Authority in S\u00e3o Vicente and the Employment and Professional Training Institute. Cabo Verde also reformed the National Planning System to align Plans, Budgets and monitoring and evaluation instruments with the SDGs. The 28 PEDS programs, aligned with the SDGs (see the Rapid Insti- tutional Assessment of the MAPS mission of November 2019), share responsibilities among sector entities, and structure the State Budget. The National Planning System, coordinated by the National Directorate of Planning and which includes the sec - toral ministries, facilitates coherence and coordination between the PEDS, sectoral plans, the State Budget and sector budget allocations. Indicators inspired by the SDGs were defined for the 35 PEDS programs, with support from the UNDP and the World Bank, to facilitate coherence in the monitoring of public policies and the SDGs. The National Statistic Office, The INE was reinforced to, together with Delegated Organs (ODINE), provide the National Directorate of Planning and sectoral ministries with the necessary statistics for the elaboration, implementation and evaluation of public policies, in line with the 2030 Agenda. An Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF) is currently being set up, aimed at strengthening the National Planning System, aligning budget and planning, and creating conditions for mobilizing new funding flows through an enabling ecosystem. The INFF will accelerate the implementa - tion of the SDGs and National and Local Development Plans through a holistic reform process, involving all relevant local, national and international actors, to opti - mize existing public and private funding flows, mobilize new sources of funding and channeling them to the sectors, areas and populations that need them most. The INFF will consist of four blocks: 1) An Evaluation of Financing for Development 2) A Financing Strategy 3) A monitoring and evaluation structure integrated in the National Planning System and especially in the Monitoring and Evaluation com - ponent, with the Ministry of Finance and the National Statistics Institute at the center 4) Strengthening of the Governance structure, namely the intersectoral and multilevel coordination of the National Planning System. In 2019, to accelerate the contribution of the institutional arrangements presented above to the advances towards the 2030 Agenda, the Government and the United Nations System developed a roadmap for the SDGs, detailing the coordination mech - anisms, the role of different institutions, 38and a possible calendar for the 2020-2030 Decade of Action. The roadmap also identi - fied 5 accelerators, capable of contributing directly and indirectly - through income and employment creation and resource mobili - zation, for the success of the SDGs, namely: Human Capital, Blue Economy, Renewable Energies, Local Tourism Value Chains, and digital economy. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the plans and in general the path towards the SDGs and thus, with the support of the United Nations, the Government carried out an assessment of the impacts of COVID- 19 (PCNA +), which led the elaboration of the Cabo Verdean Economy Response, Recovery and Promotion Plan, with the participation of the private sector. These two documents, in constant evolution as the pandemic develops, serve as a bridge between the pre-COVID (PEDS 2017-2021) and post COVID (PEDS 2022-2026) plans. Both ensure a constant and explicit link with Ambition 2030 and the SDGs In addition to these institutional arrange - ments, specifically dedicated to the appro - priation and integration of the 2030 Agenda at the national level, the Government has implemented mechanisms for greater transparency and social justice in the rela - tionship with Civil Society Organizations and, since 2016, annual notices of tenders have been launched for grants to projects of these organizations. Jointly with the NGOs Platform in Cabo Verde, competitions were held for the financing of NGO projects in the domain of productive inclusion and community development. Associations of people with disabilities are not subject to competitions to access funds for their respective functioning, although they may also compete for public notices.Entities representing the private sector, workers, educational institutions and civil society organizations, through the NGO Platform, participated in the various con - sultative bodies, namely the National Council for Employment and Vocational Training and in the evaluation sessions of the Budget Support Group. The Government of Cabo Verde decentralized some attributions related to commercial licensing, delegating them to the Chambers of Commerce. b). bEST PR aCTICE: C abO VERDE - PIONEERING COUNTRY IN THE LOC aLIZaTION OF THE SDGS The Localization of the SDGs in Cabo Verde effectively started in 2015, with the holding of the Conference on local and regional development, organized by the Municipality of Praia, which addressed the issue of the localization of the SDGs at the municipal level and the 2030 Agenda, involving main local actors, whose attention was drawn to the need for local government involve - ment from the very beginning of the SDG integration process in Cabo Verde Following this came the organization and celebration in Praia, Cabo Verde, of the 4th World Forum on Local Economic Development, between 17 and 20 October 2017, under the motto \"Local Economic Development as a means of achieving equality, equity and cohesion within the SDG framework\". The Forum analyzed and reflected on Local Economic Development as a basis for integrated and cohesive ter - 39 ritories, for resilient and peaceful societies in a fragile context and for sustainable and inclusive economies. Furthermore, it placed a special focus on the issue of Small Island Developing States. At the time of the preparation of the 2018 VNR, the platforms were starting to be implemented so they were not referenced in detail and found, on the contrary, that \"at the territorial level, there are no operational consultation structures involving the various development actors in an integrated manner and the absence of a common platform that brings together the actors prevents the necessary development of synergies\". The Platforms were set up by the Govern - ment with the support of the UNDP and the Government of Luxembourg, in partnership with the Cabo Verde National Association of Municipalities. They use the SDGs as a bridge to link national and local strategies and solutions and create the space for dia - logue between national and local levels. Local platforms in all 22 Cabo Verde municipalities bring together local authorities, state repre - sentatives at the local level, civil society, aca - demia and the private sector, and are spaces for multidimensional and multi-stakeholder dialogue and coordination. The elaboration of the Sustainable Develop - ment Strategic Plan 2017-2021 triggered the regionalization of this Plan, which deepens the knowledge of demographic dynamics, resources, productive capacity and eco - nomic potential, facilitated investments in catalytic projects that value the potential of regions and islands and thus contributed to the dynamism of the islands' economies, economic growth. It favored positive dis - crimination and improved the targeting of public social transfers and globally contributed to the reduction of regional inequalities and asymmetries, thus favoring convergence. The Platforms have drawn up a Municipal Strategic Plan for Sustainable Develop -ment with SDG targets and indicators. The Municipal Strategic Plans for Sustainable Development have a comprehensive vision of the territory and define strategies based on an integrated and multidimen - sional approach for inclusive and sustain - able development. Thus, local platforms contribute to ensuring that \"No one is left behind.\" Hence, they facilitate the dialogue between the central and local government and other local development actors, and thus the decentralization and acceleration of responses to the population, based on world references. Indeed, the Municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans ensure alignment with the PEDS and the SDGs and are, therefore, a powerful instrument for technical and political dialogue between the central and local governments, as well as for the mobilization of resources. They facilitate decentralization and, as a result, the acceleration of sustainable development. Integration of the SDGs in sectoral policies In addition to the multi-sectoral and multi-level institutional arrangements presented above, the sectoral plans have been adapted to the PEDS and the SDGs. For example, the Strategic Plan for Education allowed the majority of the Education for Excellence program to be carried out and thus considerable advances in the achievement of SDG 4 Quality Education. Likewise, the Major Options of the Strategic Plan for Sustainable Tourism constituted a guiding framework, having been drawn up following the Islands' Master Plans for Tourism, aiming to bring tourism to all islands and municipalities, enhancing the potential of each municipality or island, the local management of the destination and thus develop sustainable tourism. The Ministry of Health's Thematic Strategic Plans and the Regional Health Development Plans facilitated health development, strengthened local capacities and thus contributed to the achieve - ment of SDG 3 Quality Health. Apart from Education and Health, other relevant sectors have also adapted their strategies to the SDGs, such as the Water and Sanitation sector, the Energy sector, the Maritime Economy, Agriculture and Environment, Social Inclusion, among others. This adaptation is detailed in the following chapter on the advances of each SDG.40As a result of this important and pioneering effort to localize the SDGs, in the Scope of Cabo Verde Voluntary Local Review (2021), a survey of the 22 municipalities in the country (16 answered) showed that 81.3% of municipal actors have good knowledge of the SDGs, 87.5% consider the SDGs as a reference for the action of their municipality, and 75% consider that their municipal budget to be in line with the SDGs. The same survey reveals that municipalities prioritize SDGs 1 (81.3%), 17 (75%), 5, 6, 8 and 11 (68.8%). In addition to the municipalities, the localization of the SDGs in Cabo Verde also implies civil society and the private sector, thus fostering the stimulation of sustainable local development, especially local economic development, thanks to greater coordination of different actors with a common reference, the SDGs, translated into national and municipal plans, but also into sectoral policies that \"trickle down\" to the local level and become a part of the local development process. Tax reforms that have been implemented since 2016 align and contribute to the achievement of Ambition 2030 and thus to the SDGs, by promoting business development and \u00e9migr\u00e9 investment, essential avenues for strengthening domestic financing capacity, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Plan on financing sustainable development. These contribute to investments that value the economic potential of all Municipalities and all islands and thus to reduce regional asymmetries, promote the formative and productive inclusion of young people and, in general, the expansion of decent employ - ment and, in this way, inclusive economic growth, so as not to leave anyone behind. Tax reform creates conditions for increasing household income, promotes environmental sustainability and favors the transformation of agriculture, capable of increasing agri - cultural productivity and production and improving food security. Resource mobilization for the implemen- tation of the SDGs has been reinforced by the Conference on New Partnerships for the Sustainable Development of Cabo Verde held in Paris-France in December 2018, with success and pledges of funding and partnerships worth approximately 560 million dollars. The Cabo Verde Investment 41 Forum was held in July of same year on the island of Sal in Cabo Verde, with more than 300 participants from the private sector, national and international financial institutions, representatives of the Cabo Verdean diaspora and other development partners, with the objective of attracting foreign investment to accelerate business in sectors such as renewable energy, transport, tourism, blue economy and ICT, with the Government having announced a pipeline of investment projects and the signing of agreements with various insti- tutions worth 1.5 billion euros as a result of the event. An event of the same nature was also held in September-October in Boston-USA, with the participation of the private sector, national and international diaspora, financial institutions, and other development partners. All these events were organized with the support of the United Nations. Cabo Verde's contribution to the SDG imple - mentation process at global and regional level. At a global level, Cabo Verde has been con - ducting a process of reflection and promo - tion of Local Economic Development as a means to achieve the SDGs, holding three International Summits of Local Leaders and the 4th World Forum on Local Economic Development, in Praia, in October 2017. At the level of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Cabo Verde has actively par - ticipated in the processes of integration and advocacy, at the level of all SIDS and in the particular group of SIDS of the Atlan - tic, Indian Ocean and the South China Sea SIDS. in this context, two events, namely the Conference of Small Island States of Africa and Madagascar (SIDSAM) in 2016 and the Meeting of National Focal Points of SIDS AIS co-organized in 2019 with the Office of the United Nations High Representative for Least Developed Countries, ....in Offshore Development and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS). Cabo Verde is also part, along with Barbados and Samoa, of the global secretariat of the Multidimen - sional Vulnerability Index (MVI), which is being prepared to complement sustainable development measures. At the regional level, Cabo Verde has actively participated in the definition of the Africa Agenda 2063, and in different regional coordination mechanisms. Among other processes and events, Cabo Verde will host, in October 2021, the Regional Conference on Climate organized with UNECA, the Afri - can Development Bank and other regional partners. C). INVOLVEMENT OF DIFFERENT ST aKEHOLD - ERS IN THE IMPLEMENT aTION OF THE SDGS Since 2016, the engagement of stakeholders in the sustainable development process has been organized through different strategic moments, and materialized in the prepa - ration of reference documents, guiding the implementation of the SDGs at national and local levels: Ambition 2030, PEDS 2017-2021, Municipal Strategic Plans for Sustainable Development, COVID Impact Assessment and Response Plan, Recovery and Promotion of the Economy, etc. 42The Presidency of the Republic of Cabo Verde played a decisive role in the realization of the PEDS and the SDGs, by influencing and enacting national legislation within the scope of the implementation of the Government Program, and provided a great contribution to the preparation of the 2021 VNR, espe - cially through assessment of the country's progress in terms of democracy and the achievement of SDG 16 Justice, peace and strong institutions. As a sovereign body, and center of power par excellence, the National Parliament approved the 2016-2021 Government Pro - gram, in line with the SDGs and operation - alized by the 2017-2021 PEDS, the State budgets that implement public policies, reforms and financing and, in short, the annual implementation of the PEDS, the laws, namely those relating to tax reform and other reforms, in exercising political control over the execution of State budgets and reforms and enabled the realization of the PEDS and the SDGs, as well as participating in a qualified manner in the PEDS balance sheet and in the preparation of the 2021 VNR. As the supreme audit institution of public accounts and funds, the Court of Auditors has contributed to transparency, legality, regularity, rational management and quality of public expenditure and thus to good governance. Likewise, the political parties collaborated in the execution of the PEDS, through the National Parliament, but also in political oversight, as well as actively collaborating in the balance of advances in democracy and SDG 16. The constant and strategic participation of different relevant actors - local authorities, civil society, academia, private sector - was facilitated by their organization in mecha - nisms that created the conditions for joint work with the Government at national level, such as the NGO Platform, the National Association of Municipalities, or a more informal but very active partnership between the Stock Exchange, Chambers of Commerce, and different sector orga - nizations for the strategic representation of the private sector. In Cabo Verde, the Sustainable Development Goals are operationalized by the Strategic Plan for Sustainable Development (PEDS) in line with the SDGs. As evidenced by PEDS 2017-2021, the 2016-2020 Government Pro - gram itself is deeply impregnated by the SDGs, which will also be the case for the Government of the 10th Legislature, that is, it will have as an essential reference the Strategic Agenda for Cabo Verde's Sustain - able Development. Stakeholder commitment in implementing the PEDS is in actuality, their commitment in implementing the SDGs. The various stake - holders participated in the preparation of PEDS 2017-2021 and all participated, with greater or lesser relevance, in the execution of the PEDS. NGOs and especially those from social areas participated as Govern - ment's and Municipalities' partners in the 43 implementation of PEDS programs; the representations of the private sector and the professional orders carried out public responsibilities delegated to them and participated in the organization of events to mobilize resources and partnerships and in the technical and political dialogue; Institutions of higher education carried out the Government's policy for higher education and research. Trade union organizations contributed to peace at workplace and the fulfillment of the PEDS and the SDGs through the 2017-2021 strategic concertation agreement, and social concertation, namely within the scope of State budgets, health, economic and social emergency measures during the COVID pandemic. The United Nations System engaged and participated in a qualified and relevant way in the preparation of PEDS 2017-2021, in the mobilization of resources, with special emphasis on the International Conference held in Paris - France in December 2018, on \u00abNew partnerships for Cabo Verde's sus- tainable development\", on the Cabo Verde Investment Forum held on the island of Sal in July 2019, on the mobilization of resources within the framework of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, on the initiative and partnership with the government in the assessment of the COVID-19 pandemic during the preparation of the response, recovery and promotion plan for the Cabo Verdean economy. The Municipalities also participated in the processes of preparing the PEDS 2017-2021 and its regionalization, as well as, and especially in, the localization of the SDGs, with the implementation of local development platforms and the prepa - ration of Municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans. These entities, the Cabo Verdean diaspora, the United Nations, the World Bank, the ADB, among other development partners, participated in setting the SDG roadmap, in the choice of sustainable development accelerators in the Cabo Verde Ambition 2030 exercise and are part of Cabo Verde's Strategic Agenda for Sustainable Develop- The role of municipalities in implementing the SDGs at national and local levels Despite the pandemic crisis and technical, institutional, financial and economic shortcomings, the general consensus is that, thanks to the decentralization process initiated in 1991, the municipalities are the main actors and leaders in the SDG localization process. The Municipal Platforms Program, a \"d\u00e9marche\" and an instrument of planning and territorial governance, contributed, during the process of preparing the Municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans (PEMDS), toward helping municipalities gain awareness of the importance of PEMDS for the localization of the SDGs. Currently, 20 of the 22 Municipalities have drawn up and approved their respec - tive PEMDS, and are thus endowed with instruments for planning territorial development. The priority SDGs for the municipalities are: poverty (SDG 1), water and sanitation (6), sustainable cities and communities (11), and partnerships (17), followed by the SDGs on gender equality (5), health (3), education (4) and economic development (8). Jacinto Abreu Santos for United Cities and Local Governments (UCLU), Cabo Verde Voluntary Local Report44ment. In particular, the United Nations took the initiative and participated in a qualified manner in the assessment of the impacts of COVID-19 (PCNA +) and in the preparation of the Response Plan for the Recovery and Promotion of the Cabo Verdean Economy. These entities should participate in the governance of the Labor Market Observatory and in the Mechanism for the implementa - tion and follow-up of Cabo Verde's Strategic Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs. D). MECH aNISMS TO STRENGTHEN THE ENG MONITORING STR aTEGIC - MENT aGEND a Decentralization Cape Verdean authorities recognize the importance of decentralization, given the potential it has to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs, and consider its broadening strategic, through the strengthening and con - solidation of municipalism, regionalization, and decentralization through civil society organizations and the private business sector. They will proceed with the decentralization of more attributions to the Municipalities and this will be a powerful instrument to facilitate the execution of the PEDS and to accelerate local development, densify the powers exercised in proximity with citizens, bring decisions closer to them and expand the space for participation. Likewise, local authorities will proceed with the decen - tralization of municipal responsibilities to civil society organizations. Medium and long-term partnerships will be adopted between the Government and Civil Soci - ety Organizations and between Municipal Chambers and those organizations. Public-private partnerships Cape Verdean authorities will use their best efforts to establish public-private partner - ships between the State and national or foreign private companies as a powerful instrument to make the country's largest investments viable in the domains of the blue economy, the digital economy, renew - able energies, and the development of the international health platform, which in the long term will result in the diversification and resilience of the Cabo Verdean economy. Social concertation Strategic concertation agreements at the level of the Social Concertation Council should be elected as a mechanism par excellence for building social and labor peace, predictability, contributing to the improvement of the business environment, economic growth and the promotion of decent employment. Economic, Social and Environmental Council The establishment of the Economic, Social and Environmental Council will expand spaces for participation by the private sec - tor, civil society, academia, organizations representing workers, will enhance dialogue and public policies. 45 Development of the social economy The social and solidarity-based economy will be developed, through the improvement of the legal framework, the approval of a Mutu - ality Code a law on Private Social Solidarity Institutions the revision of the legal frame- work for foundations, approval of a specific tax statute for social economy entities with a specific accounting plan for non-profit CSOs, with the exception of cooperative societies, mutual societies and social enterprises, and a legal regime of public funding for non-profit CSOs and expansion of the contracting law to social and solidarity economy entities, within the scope of promoting an inclusive public market. It will also be developed through the reinforcement of financing through pro - vision in the State budget and capacitation of human capital of CSOs. E). LEaVE NO ONE bEHIND Leaving no one behind is one of the princi - ples of the Sustainable Development Goals. As Cabo Verde is a Middle-Income Country, not leaving anyone behind is, above all, a challenge of allocation, - that is, of distri - bution of national wealth. Despite our successful history over the course of these 46 years as an independent nation, Cabo Verde continues to be a country of profound inequalities and regional asymme- tries. The COVID-19 pandemic is deepening existing social vulnerabilities and increasing impoverishment to the point that increasingly large numbers of people are at risk of being left behind during the period of economic and social recovery. The fulfillment of the 2030 Agenda, operationalized in the short and medium term by the economic and social response and recovery plans and in the long term by the next two Strategic Sustainable Development Plans, should be taken advantage of as an opportunity not to continue to leave certain groups behind, but also not to allow new groups to be left behind. Action must be early, starting with those furthest behind. For Cabo Verdean authorities, leaving no one behind means not leaving any child, teenager, young person, adult or elderly person behind. It means not leaving any neighborhood, location, zone, town, city, municipality or island behind. It is also mean not leaving Cabo Verde behind. The 2018 VNR identified the groups that have been left behind and we made com - mitments were made to include them, to ensure the number of those left behind does not increase, - namely the poor, especially people living in extreme poverty, young people without higher education, families without access to water or elec - tricity and people with special educational needs. Within the scope of the 2021 VNR, and to prepare the new programming cycle (PEDS 2022-2027), the Government of Cabo Verde and the United Nations developed a detailed study \"Leave No One Behind\", following United Nations guidelines for the \"LNOB Assessment\". This study allowed for a deeper analysis of groups at risk of being left behind, the barriers they face in their access to social services and economic opportuni - ties, and the causes of this exclusion. In this VNR we will start by looking briefly at the barriers that hinder access to services and opportunities for some groups. We will identify, on the basis of these barriers, those 46groups that are left behind or are at risk of being left behind. In analyzing this moral dimension of the SDGs, it is imperative to also determine the root causes and mecha - nisms that structure this process of leaving behind. Barriers that prevent universal access to sus - tainable development These barriers are either collective or indi - vidual in nature. The collective barriers are institutional or structural in nature, linked, among others, to Cabo Verde's archipelagic condition, the consequent high per capita cost of social services, public resources too limited, to ensure universal and quality coverage, and the restrictions on private investment that limit economic dynamism. These barriers remain because public and private efforts are insufficient or insufficiently effective to eliminate them. These barriers leave entire groups behind, depending on their geographic or socio-economic situation. Individual barri - ers are cultural in nature and leave individuals behind because of their origin, their personal situation, or their life choices. In Cabo Verde, barriers of a collective nature are materialized in the difficulties in accessing skills and economic and financial services in rural areas. The rural exodus that these barriers provoke results in urban poverty as well. These barriers hold back agricultural and farming households and communities, many of them headed by women, especially those located in informal urban settlements and rural areas. A large proportion of households in the peripheral outskirts of Cabo Verde's cities, as well as those headed by women, are single-parent households, with these women, on average, having a low level of education. In terms of employment, they operate mostly in the informal economy and have less income and, therefore, have a lower level of consumption and live in houses with a lower level of comfort. The size of these households is, as a rule, larger than the national average, the incidence of poverty is more significant 47 and unemployment among those of active age tends to be higher. In these households, teenage pregnancy tends to be more present, and gender-based violence, if not higher than the national average, is nevertheless more frequently reported. Likewise, it is these households that have the most indi - viduals in need of care, namely children, people with disabilities and the elderly, and the head of which tends to be women or for which an active young woman ensures care, conditioning their participation in the labor market. Furthermore, we may be in the presence of households in which there are children and teenagers responsible for the care of younger siblings and relatives when adults, usually women, develop eco - nomic activities (as entrepreneurs) or work for others. In agricultural and livestock farms that have women as their main representatives, access to agricultural land is more difficult, and land is essentially less productive dryland. Women rarely own the land, aggravating legal uncertainty and making it difficult to carry out long-term investments. The size of farms tends to be insufficient for the needs of those working them. Food insecurity is particularly relevant, especially in dry years and in families with little or no income outside of agriculture and livestock farming. Families associated with these farms also present the other characteristics and configurations referred to for households in the urban peripheries. Barriers of an individual nature limit the access of some individuals to social services and economic opportunities, depending on their gender, physical and/or mental con -dition, ethnicity, sexual orientation or legal status. These barriers are cultural in nature and are based on social standards that determine the role and position of power that society assumes should be incumbent on each individual in the public and private spheres. Who, how many and where are those who have stayed or are at risk of being left behind? The collective and individual barriers exposed in the previous subsection mean that a substantial part of the population remains or is at risk of being left behind. These people constitute 9 distinct groups. This subsection describes these groups and their situation. The following subsection will describe the causes of the barriers and deprivations they confront. People who have stayed or are at risk of being left behind constitute 9 distinct groups. They comprise 175,844 people living in absolute poverty, that is, on less than US$ 1.90 a day, of which 88,093 are women. There are 77,480 young people not in employment education or training (NEET), of which 53% are female; 48,359 elderly, of which 60% are female, approximately 14,300 immigrants, mostly (63.4%) male and in the vast majority (78.9%) from the African continent, 104,342 people with at least one type of disability and in particular 48about 17.5% of people with at least one disability who have extreme special needs, the equivalent of roughly 3.5% of the Cape Verdean population, 1,798 prisoners and other individuals deprived of their liberty, the majority of which (97.4%) are male, 154,049 children and teenagers, of which 75,886 are female; and particularly the 29,350 members of poor families, minorities made invisible by sexual orientation (that is, those whose numbers and detailed profile elements are not known), and a cross-cuttingly at-risk group made up of young girls and women. Causal and staggered risk factors for falling behind Colonial domination, the structure of colo - nial domination and the colonial economy, the absence of structuring policies for the development of infrastructure to support self-centered economic and social develop -ment, the absence of equitable investment in human capital, the transformation of the territorial discontinuity, mechanisms of inequality and social cleavages through the deepening of regional asymmetries are historical causal factors of staggered risks of being left behind. Staggered causal economic factors of the risks of falling behind include poverty and inequalities, unemployment and lack of economic opportunities, the absence or inadequateness of protection mechanisms, the loss of livelihoods, shadow economies and corruption. Perceived relative deprivation, low levels of safety, poor quality of governance, disparity/ inequality of power, elite dominance and elite resource capture, social marginalization and lack of opportunities for participation, lack of balance in authority and \"cult of personality\" are causal social, organizational and political economy factors escalating the risks of being left behind. Patriarchalism, the machi-matricentered society, heteronormativity and stigmatiza - tion, devaluation of Africans on the basis of prejudice of origin and color are causal sociocultural factors, staggering the risks of falling behind. Measures not to Leave No Anyone Behind Measures should be taken within the scope of the 2021-2022 response, recovery and social development plan, and especially the PEDS 20022-2026, to include those left behind and reduce risk, so as not to jeopardize the achievement of the SDGs - that is, measures to fight poverty, food insecurity and income inequalities, but also promote inclusive economic growth, income and prices, investments that reduce territorial asymmetries, strengthen and effectively integrate the Education, Training and Employment System, for monitoring and evaluation, strengthening of the National Statistical System for the development of Private Social Solidarity Institutions and capacity development, as well as spe- cific measures aimed at groups that have remained and are at risk of being left behind, namely poor and very poor individuals and those in a situation of food insecurity, young individuals NEET, the elderly, immigrants, people with disabilities including those with mental disorders, prisoners and others deprived of liberty, children, adolescents and youth, minorities due to sexual orientation and girls, youth and women. 49 SDG 1. ERADICATE POVERTYPROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THE SDGS50SDG 1. ERADICATE POVERTY According to INE estimates, in 2020, 72,874 poor people lived in Cabo Verde, that is, with less than US$ 1.90 per day, equivalent to 13.1% of the population. Absolute poverty has a higher incidence in rural areas, where 24.3% of the population is poor, while 8.1% is in urban areas, with differences between gender, as approximately 8.3% of the male population living in urban areas is poor, surpassing by 0.3 percentage points that of women living in the same areas, while about 25% of the female population living in rural areas is poor, surpassing the male population living in rural areas by 1.3 percentage points. Absolute poverty was reduced by 10.6 per - centage points - that is, on average, 2.1 percentage points per year, despite the effects of 3 years of severe drought and the COVID-19 pandemic. In Cabo Verde about 13% of men and 13.1% of women are poor. The incidence of poverty is higher among men than among women in the 0-4 age groups (24.9% versus 19.1%), and 65 and over (8.1% versus 7.6%), respectively, and higher among women in the 5-9 age groups (19.9% versus 18.5%), In Cabo Verde, approximately 22% of children aged 0-4 years are poor. Poverty is inversely proportionate to age, reaching, for example, 16.1% among young people aged 15-24 and 7.8% among the population aged 65 and over. Thus, about 40.3% of the poor population is under 15 years old, 20.7% is 15-24 years old and 37.6% of the poor are young people aged 15-34 years old. As a result, 77.9% of the poor are under 35 years of age, which highlights the level of youth poverty that needs to be tackled, so as not to compromise the potential for creativity, innovation and acceleration of economic growth. Work must be elected as the link between growth and human development, because people who are employed have income. Pro - moting decent employment growth means promoting inclusive economic growth. In Cabo Verde, about 7.8% of employed people are poor, far below the figure for the 51 unemployed (19.1%), the inactive (13.9%) and even the population aged 15 and over as a whole (10.6 %). Among employed people, the difference in the poverty rate is minimal between males (7.6%) and females (8%) and among those living in urban and rural areas (3.4% and 3.7%, respectively), but the difference is more pronounced among those living in rural areas, where around 21.3% of employed women are poor, against 17.9% among employed men living in the same area. The same profile is also found among the unemployed, as 19.1% of the unemployed are poor, a figure much higher in rural areas (25.4%) than in urban areas (17.1%). Among unemployed males, some 17.7% are poor, a figure lower than among women (20.9%). The incidence of poverty among unemployed males living in rural areas is 25.4%, practically equal to that of women living in the same areas (25.3%), and higher than that among males in urban areas (15.4%) and females in the same area (19.4%). The same profile is seen among the inactive population, of which 13.9% is poor, a figure much higher in rural areas (24.3%) than in urban areas (8%). Among inactive males, some 14.3% are poor, a figure higher than that seen among women (13.5%). The incidence of poverty among inactive males living in rural areas is 24.6%, practically the same as that of women living in the same areas (24.1%), and is lower among men in urban areas (8.9%) and among women in urban areas (7.2%).In general, about 10.6% of the population aged 15 or over is poor, with 6.0% among those in urban areas, far below those in rural areas (20.1%). Among the male popu - lation aged 15 or over, approximately 10.0% is poor, with a slight difference in relation to females (11.1%) and the differences are minimal in urban areas (5.7 versus 6.3 % among males and females, respectively), slightly more expressive among those in rural areas, being 19.1% among men and 21.1% among women. The incidence of poverty varies among the counties of the country, with S\u00e3o Filipe being the poorest county in Cabo Verde, with about 39.7% of the population living in this situation of deprivation. It is followed by the municipalities of Santa Cruz (31.8%), Pa\u00fal (30.2%), S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os (29.1%), and these belong to the group of 11 municipalities with the highest poverty rates, that is, with an incidence above the national average. Boavista is the least poor municipality (1.7%), followed by Sal (3.7%) and Ribeira Grande (6.2%), and these belong to the group of 11 municipalities with an incidence below the national average. The poor are concentrated in the largest population centers. Thus, the municipality of Praia, the country's capital, concentrates about 18.4% of the poor population, followed by Santa Cruz (12.7%), S\u00e3o Filipe (12.3%) and 52Santa Catarina (8, 8%), and group is home to about 46.7% of Cabo Verde's poor. S\u00e3o Vicente is nearby, with 6.8% of the poor population and, together with the other municipalities, it comprises about 59% of the poor population of Cabo Verde. About 6.8% of households are poor - that is, they have an average daily per capita consumption of below US$ 1.90, and the incidence is higher among households headed by women (8.7%), which surpass those headed by men by 4 percentage points. Household size is also a determining factor of poverty. Thus, the incidence of poverty is nil among single-person house - holds and only 1% among those with 2 members, but reaches 8.9% among those with 5 members and 29.5% among those with 7 members or more. Among house- holds headed by women, the incidence is also practically nil up to 2 members, but it reaches 10.3% among those with 5 members and 34% among those with 7 members or more. The same profiles show no poverty among households headed by men with zero to 2 members, but the figure reaches 7.3% among those with 5 members and 23.2% among those with 7 members or more. The incidence of poverty is nil among sin - gle-person and nuclear conjugal house - holds, headed by men or women, with a maximum of 14.7% among composite conjugal households and especially among those headed by women (17.9%), followed by composite single-parent households (12.8%), especially among those headed by women (13.8%). Contrary to what common sense would seem to dictate, poverty has a higher incidence among composite conjugal households headed by women. Poverty is more prevalent among house- holds represented by women (8.7%), sur - passing the average and those represented by men by 1.9 and 4.1 percentage points. Although the incidence of poverty is equal to the average, with regard to 1 or 2 mem - bers households represented by women, it reaches 10.3% among those with 5 mem- bers, being 1.4 and 2.9 percentage points above the average and those represented by men, respectively, and, above all, it reaches about 34.0% among those with 7 members or more, being 4.5 and 10.8 percentage points above the average and those represented by men, respectively. Household size is an important determinant of poverty. Thus, the incidence of poverty is nil among single-person households and only 0.1% among those with 2 members, but reaches 8.9% among those with 5 members and 29.5% among those with 7 members or more. Poverty is more prevalent among households headed by women (8.7%), sur - passing the average of those headed by men by 1.9 and 4.1 percentage points. Although the incidence of poverty is equal to the average among 1- or 2-member households headed by women, it reaches 10.3% among those with 5 members, being 1.4 and 2.9 percentage points above the average of those headed by men, respectively, and, above all, it reaches about 34% among those with 7 members or more, being 4.5 and 10.8 percentage points above the average and those headed by men, respectively.

According to poverty data as per the national threshold, in 2020, 175,844 poor people lived in Cabo Verde - that is, people with less than US$ 2.77 per day, equivalent to 31.6% of the popu- lation. About 31.2% of men and 32% of women are poor in accordance with this threshold. Absolute poverty has a higher incidence in rural areas, where 44.9% of the popula - tion is poor, and stands at 25.8% in urban areas, with differences between genders, as about 26.1% of the female population living in urban areas is poor, surpassing by 0.3 percentage points the men living in this area, and about 45.7% of the female population living in rural areas is poor, surpassing the male population living in this area by 0.8 percentage points.The incidence of poverty is higher among males than among females in the 0-4 year age group (50.9% versus 44.1%), compared to the 15-24 year group (40.7 versus 32.7), and higher among women that age or older, but decreasing regularly, thus being 18.8% and 20.0% among men and women aged 65 and over, respectively. In Cabo Verde, about 47.6% of children aged 0-4 years are poor, and poverty decreases with age, reaching, for example, 38.3% among young people aged 15-24 and 19,6% among the population aged 65 and over. The reduction in poverty between 2016 and 2019 was due, in part, to economic growth (on average 4.7% per year), but mainly to the reduction of inequalities through public social transfers. With the COVID-19 pandemic and the near stoppage of tourist activity, international mobility and restrictions on internal mobility and the consequent increase in employment and social vulnerabilities, the incidence of poverty could have been higher in 2020, were it not for the employ - ment protection policies adopted, as the lay-off regime for employees enrolled in social security, with 17,380 beneficiaries in the first phase, 7,681 in the second phase and 6,926 in the third phase, and Contamination Prevention Isolation Sub - sidies for 1,598 people. Income transfer measures were adopted, including unemployment benefits to 1,947 workers and an increase in the number of beneficiaries of the Social Inclusion Income to 13,819, the one-off allocation of Solidarity Income to 24,448 workers enrolled in the Special Micro and Small Businesses Tax Regime (REMPE) and workers of families with insured domestic workers or registered with the INPS and informal sector workers. Food baskets were donated to about 25,000 families at risk of food insecurity. Earlier this year, Cabo Verdean authorities adopted a package of additional measures aimed at poor families, which included the extension of the Social Inclusion Income to 29,000 families in extreme poverty or poor families with children under 15, eligible under the Single Social Registry (RSI households), the guarantee of pro - fessional training to all young people not in employment, education or training and the productive integration of 1/3 of these, namely through the micro-entrepreneur - ship promotion program, the requalifica - tion of degraded housing from these same households, and exemption from emer - gency room, surgery and hospitalization user fees in health facilities. These measures also include dignified con - sumption of electricity and water with the forgiveness of debts, no-fee reconnections and social tariffs for water and electric - ity, but also connections to the grid for households that have never benefited from these services, in order to promote digni - fied consumption by the poor and reduce 54Thus, about 37.1% of the poor population is under 15 years old, one in 5 is 15-24 years old and 37.7% are young people aged 15-34 years old. As a result, 3 out of 4 poor people are under 35 years of age, which highlights the level of youth poverty that needs to be tackled, so as not to compromise the poten- tial for creativity, innovation and acceleration of economic growth. In 2020, 103,613 workers were registered as active insured workers, equivalent to a coverage rate of 56% of the working population, which represents a decrease of 1.6% when compared to the previous year. In actuality, however, the coverage rate increased when considering the fact that the employed population fell by 9.6%, a decrease much more pronounced than the insured population. Since 2015, the contributory regime of the social security system has expanded considerably, from a coverage of 39.5% of workers in that year to around 55.5% in 2020, and a coverage of 38.1% of the resident population in Cabo Verde at the beginning of the period to about 45.1% in 2020. The 2020 coverage level represents a significant reduction compared to the last pre-crisis year, in which the num - ber of insured workers reached 105,272 workers, equivalent to a coverage rate of 51%. The coverage rate evolved in the opposite direction, as the reduction in the total of insured persons (-1.6%) was much less accentuated than that of the employed population (-9.6%) in the last year. At the end of 2020, the non-con - tributory scheme covered around 22,866 beneficiaries, which represents an average annual growth of 1.5% since 2015, with the elderly being the majority. The non-contributory scheme provides a monthly pension of US$66 and drug coverage, with an annual ceiling of US$ 21.60, and covers individuals aged 60 years and over and children from poor families, people with disabilities or chronic disabling losses. Added to this is the extension of the co-financing period for professional internships from 6 to 8 months, and the exemption from taxes and fees for micro and small businesses, in order to alleviate the tax burden and free up income for families. Cabo Verdean authorities will also promote the expansion of the social pension to 18,000 elderly beneficiaries, ensuring that by 2026 at least 74.4% of the elderly will have a pension. These measures contribute toward ensuring that more people will avoid being left behind. This package of measures is part of the social emergency program that is itself part of the Social Response, Recovery and Development Plan, aiming, by 2026, to eradicate extreme poverty, with a view to eradicating absolute poverty in 2030. 55 illnesses, under the age of 18, belonging to households with an annual income below the poverty threshold, and without the coverage of any social security scheme, national or foreign. At the end of 2020, it covered 22,866 beneficiaries, which rep - resents an average annual growth of 1.5% since 2015 and, taking contributory benefi - ciaries (6,669) into account, we have 29,535 elderly people with a pension, equivalent to 61% of the elderly population, which in itself testifies to the attention paid to the elderly in terms of income and the level of fulfillment of the rights of this population segment provided for, namely, in article 77, paragraph 2, point a) of the Constitution of the Republic, which enshrines the rights of the elderly and, specifically, the promotion of economic and social conditions that facilitate their decent participation in family and social life. In Cabo Verde, 69 out of every 100 peo - ple have the public water network as their main source of water supply, and significant differences remain between rural and urban areas. In the latter about 74.7% of the population has the pub - lic water network as their main source supply, surpassing the rural area by 17.4 percentage points. About 92.2% of the population has access to electricity, being about 92.5% of the female population, against 91.9% of the male population. Access to electricity is higher in urban areas (94.1%) than in rural areas, where 88.4% of the population has access to this basic service. 85 out of every 100 people residing in Cabo Verde live in accommodations with bath - room facilities, with significant differences between urban areas, where 91 out of 100 have this facility, and rural areas, where 74 out of 100 live in accommoda - tions with these facilities. About 82.4% of the population uses a safe sanitation system, meaning they live in accommo - dations with sanitary facilities connected to a septic tank (52.9%) or to the sewer system (29.6%), with notable differences between urban areas, where 87.6% of the population uses a safe sanitation system, 56and rural areas, where about 71.8% of the population has access to these facilities. In urban areas, the use of the sewage system is more expressive (45%) than in rural areas, where 68.8% of the population lives in housing with toilets connected to the septic tank. About 81% of the population disposes of solid waste properly, i.e. placed in garbage containers or collected directly by garbage trucks, with notable differences between urban areas, where 96.7% of the population disposes of garbage properly, i.e. placing it in garbage containers (65.2%) or collected directly by garbage trucks (31.5%), against only 52.2% of the population of rural areas disposing of this waste properly, placing them in garbage containers (46.5%) or col - lected directly by garbage trucks (5.6%). Solid waste management still poses serious challenges to be overcome within the scope of the National Solid Waste Management Strategic Plan (PENGER). In 2018, Cabo Verde adopted the National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy (2018- 2030) and the National Post-Disaster Recovery Framework (2018-2030), a strategy operationalized by the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (PEDS) through the program \"Management of Environmental, Geological and Climatic Risks,\" and, in a partial manner, through the program \"Biodiversity Conservation and Environmental Quality.\" To date, risk assessment has been carried out in 4 municipalities in the country, a Post-Disaster Recovery Framework has been prepared, and the Municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans (PEMDS) of some municipalities integrate the disaster risk approach. We consider social inclusion programs as programs to fight poverty, which is why we include the programs \"Guaranteeing access to income, education, care and health\" and \"Guaranteeing the rights and protection of children and teenagers.\" The volume of public resources allocated to these programs represents 14.4% of public expenditure and 5.1% of GDP. The volume of donations, that is, non-debt-generating flows directly allocated to poverty reduction programs, represents only 0.2% of GDP. The evolution of the economy and of social policies over the last five years permitted a decrease in inequalities and an acceleration in poverty reduction, with an average growth of 4.7% until 2019 and an increase in public transfers, which went from about US$ 58.8 million in 2015 to US$ 97 million in 2020, as well as the active employment reforms car- ried out and those under way in the field of education of excellence. The COVID-19 pandemic destroyed value with a 14.8% recession and the destruction of around 9% of employment in 2020, and, indeed, is aggravating the impoverishment of the population. However, the Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda provides for the recovery, stabilization and acceleration of economic growth, promoting the diver - sification of the Cabo Verdean economy and aiming to achieve economic growth of no less than 5% per year, between 2021 and 2025, and no less than 7% per year, between 2026 and 2030, and consequently, a doubling of the GDP per capita by 2030. The social emergency is now at the center of government priorities, prioritizing the fight against impoverishment, in order to achieve the eradication of extreme poverty by 2026 and, above all, the eradication of poverty by 2030.57 SDG 2. ERADICATE HUNGER58SDG 2. ERADICATE HUNGER Cabo Verde is a country that is extremely vulnerable, from the point of view of food security, to agro-climactic variations, as well as to fluctuations in the world market. In the past several years, more than 90% of all grains (corn, rice, wheat) consumed in Cabo Verde have come from abroad, both in the form of food aid and as commercial imports, with the latter's weight tending to increase with the gradual reduction in food aid, which currently represents some 30% of imports, a reduction due, in large part, to Cabo Verde's status as a Middle Income Country and to the changes in the modalities of official development assistance resulting therefrom. In Cabo Verde, hunger is not a mass phenom - enon, but food insecurity is present. According to FAO, in 2019, approximately 18.5% of the population was undernourished. Available data indicates that 33.8% of households could not afford safe, nutritious and sufficient food (IN-VANF 2019). Food insecurity in the country is manifested in a threefold manner, namely: the retardation of growth in children under 5, which affects 1 in 10; obesity, which has remained stable in this age group but has seen exponential growth in the adult popula - tion; and anemia, which despite gains is still considered a grave public health problem, affecting 42% of children under 5. The country has made remarkable progress since independence, placing food and nutri -tional security at the center of the governing agenda at the central, local and community level, with priority given to planning with the elaboration, in 2002, of the first food and nutritional security strategic paper (ENSA), updated in 2014 for the 2020 hori - zon, placing greater emphasis on nutritional issues and on the Human Right to Adequate Food (HRAF). Important gains include the strengthening of the architecture and legal framework for the governance of the food sector, which has permitted the monitoring of the food and nutritional security situa - tion in the country; the National Food and Nutritional Security Council, created in 2013, aimed at improving food and nutritional security policy coordination mechanisms; and Law-Decree n\u00ba 37/2018 on the Human 59 Right to Adequate Food, which establishes the policy directives for the governance of the subject and the recognition thereof. Ensuring food and nutritional security is possible, and the challenge of doing so has been taken on by Cabo Verdean authorities. This requires excellent articulation and coordination between the various dif - ferent actors intervening in the sector, with policy priorities and financing and partnership needs having been identified. The National Food and Nutritional Security Strategy for the 2020 horizon is aimed at guaranteeing food and nutritional security by ensuring the fulfillment of the Human Right to Adequate Food. The National Food and Nutritional Security Strategy also contributes toward improving condi - tions of access to water, basic sanitation and other components of wellbeing in order to increase agricultural and farm production and fishing in a sustainable manner, perfecting food supply mecha - nisms, improving the income of vulnerable populations so as to be able to afford food and developing nutritional disorder prevention and treatment actions and supplementary, orientation and nutritional education actions in order to encourage the adoption of healthy eating habits. Important strategic governing instruments converge in order to achieve this important sustainable development goal, especially the Law on the Human Right to Adequate Food (1), the National School Lunch Program (2), the 2018-2022 National Agricultural and Food and Nutritional Security Investment Program (3), the Single Social Registry (4), Cabo Verde's Country Resilience Priorities (PRP/AGIR) for the 2017-2021 period (5), and various other projects (6) aimed at improving the living conditions of the rural population in the respective zones of intervention, with a special emphasis on female and young heads of household, in order to, as a result, increase the country's resilience in the face of climate change. Cabo Verdean agriculture consists predomi- nantly of family farming and occupies slightly more than 9% of the nation's territory, and is characterized by small plots (0.4 hectares for irrigated plots and 0.9 hectares for dry farming), with water being the main limiting factor, along with the scarcity of arable soil, geographical and orographic conditions and the archipelago's territorial discontinuity. Despite all of these limiting factors, agri - culture in Cabo Verde is practiced by 1/3 of all households, although its contribution to national wealth is modest (8% of total GDP). It is, however, the sector that employs the most individuals, with the exception of during drought years. Cabo Verde does not have the structural conditions to produce all of the food its population needs and, as such, remains highly dependent on imports. Neverthe - less, Cabo Verdean authorities are aware that the country has the capacity to pro - duce vegetables, fruits, eggs and meat (poultry, goats and other small animals) in order to meet the demand of the domestic market. This capacity, however, needs to be encouraged and enhanced. TThe development of agriculture requires investments in infrastructure, research, extension and technology development in order to increase agricultural production capacity. In 2020, the Agricultural Orienta - Table 2.

As such, in the last five years, it was only in 2016 and 2017 that the weight of agriculture in public expenditures was lower than its contribution to the gross domestic product, standing at 0.7 and 0.51, respectively. Over the past 5 years, agricultural yields have dropped significantly, with the gross value added per worker having decreased an average of 3.7% per year, with the most significant drop seen in 2020 (-24.4%). However, in the four pre-crisis years, the average annual variation in GVA per worker was 2.34%. GVA in agriculture dropped an average of 10% a year between 2015 and 2020. As such, although it was close to 1 (in other words, a neutral level), this performance bears witness to the level of priority the sector was given, within a context of a reduction in production and respective value added. Indeed, invest - ment efforts in agriculture were also high between 2000 and 2015, during which period some 484 million US dollars were invested in the agricultural sector, equivalent to an average of 28 million US dollars per year and approximately 1.8% of GDP in 2016. During this same period (2000-2015), some 40,000 people abandoned agriculture, with the vast majority of them migrating to urban centers and, espe - cially, to the tourist-oriented islands of Boa Vista and Sal. The abandonment of agriculture is, thus, a striking phenomenon, and could be an indication of a certain failure of agri - cultural policies, in light of the considerable investments carried out. However, appreciable progress is being made in the introduction of new species and varieties specially adapted to local edaphoclimatic conditions, in the massi - fication of new production technologies such as protected crops, in hydroponic production, in the rational use of water (massification of efficient irrigation systems, with an emphasis on micro-irrigation systems) and in the use of renewable energies to pump water and to reduce water production costs, among others. If we consider that the forms of organization and access to specific markets related to socioeconomic, environmental and cultural factors are salient characteristics of agro - ecology-based organic agriculture, it may be affirmed that in Cabo Verde this practice is still in a very incipient phase, although many farmers grow produce without the use of pesticides. Albeit still timid, there are a number of initiatives by individuals and some organizations (for example, Caritas in Praia and CERAI in S\u00e3o Vicente) that practice organic agriculture. In making this issue one of its axes of intervention in the Government Program of the 9th and 10th Legislatures, the Government attempted to focus attention on the mate- rialization of organic farming. As such, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment has been carrying out various training and awareness-raising activities geared toward both agricultural specialists and farmers, and has elaborated the Organic Agriculture Base Law. There is a need to continue with these actions, which it is hoped will culminate in the creation of social organizations on the part of farmers (such as associations of organic producers) and society in general that will defend production modes featuring organic characteristics. On the other hand, there is a need to inte- grate farmers' traditional know-how with scientific knowledge, something that should be translated into research directed to this area. As such, the theme will be one of the innovations of the Agriculture Transformation Program, which is currently in the process of being implemented. Over the past 18 years, Cabo Verdean authorities have promoted a program aimed at collecting and conserving genetic resources for agriculture and food, based on on-site prospection on the country's various islands and the off-site collection and storage/conservation of seeds, with a focus on traditional crops such as locally produced corn and beans, the cultivation of which has been kept up over the years, but making use of internationally recognized techniques and standards (IPGRI, ISTA). The program consists of the off-site conservation of genetic resources in order to provide the country with seed/germplasm collections that will help ensure food and nutritional security. As such, the National Agricultural Research and Development Institute (INIDA) seed bank contains 358 vegetable species collections, including 11 agricultural species (essentially local varieties of corn and beans) and 52 wild species, 134 of which are endemic and/or endangered, among other species. Animal \"genetic improvement\" programs have been based essentially on the introduction of European (bovine, caprine, porcine and 61 rabbit) and African (ovine) breeds and the crossbreeding thereof with \"local\" breeds. Between the 1990s and 2003, Frisian cattle hailing from the Azores and Holstein from Spain were introduced in the country, and with the inducement of genetic material, the milk production quality of local herds increased nationwide. In 2014, a pilot program was introduced for the artificial insemina - tion of cattle, with the introduction of frozen semen from Girolando and Jersey breeds imported from Brazil (CRV Lagoa da Serra). Also introduced were several breeds of swine species (landrace, large white, pietrain and duroc), goat species (from Canary island and Saanen breeds), lamb species (Peul breed from Niger), equine species (English Purebred, Lusitanian, Arabic and Quarter horse), fowl species (Rhode Island Red, hyline, goldline) and rabbit species of the hyplus, California, Chinchilla, New Zealand and white giant breeds. The introduction of these breeds harks back to the colonial era, with the objective of crossbreeding with local animals and thus improving gene stock. Local domestic animal breeds have been preserved thanks to the favorable climate and zootechnical assistance. Major investments were made in the agri - cultural sector between 2015 and 2019 but dropped significantly in 2020, a year in which budget priorities were redirected to the health and social emergency caused by the pan - demic. The volume of donations channeled to the agricultural sector fell from 16,585,400 USD in 2017 to 1,236,104 USD - in other words, a 14-fold reduction in just three years. These donations, which represented 71% of total external financing for the sector in 2017, responded for just 42% in 2020. Given a series of obvious structural constraints, such as the lack of natural resources, priorities in the agricultural sector, particularly during the first years following independence, were centered on issues related to food security and the fight against desertification, with mat - ters such as product quality and certification, capable of leveraging the aggregate value of national production, relegated to the back burner, which resulted in agricultural exports in Cabo Verde being virtually inexpressive and not benefiting from any state subsidies. The price of the goods and services considered representative of the consumption structure of Cabo Verde's resident population, with the exception of fruits, remained stable in the period between 2015 and 2020, considering the fact that the Consumer Price Index during those years averaged between 100.3 and 102.3, with some atypical variation, however, being registered in fruit prices. With the COVID-19 pandemic, which dragged the entire world into an unprecedented eco - nomic crisis and which profoundly altered the international context, it became urgently necessary to readjust and readapt develop - ment plans to a new reality that is still full of uncertainties and whose end is not yet in sight. Although agricultural production was not directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic and financial crisis that affected the economy and businesses in particular, reflected in an increase in agricultural produc - tion costs and difficulties in the distribution of products as a result of travel restrictions, has had a direct impact on the purchasing power of households. On the other hand, in times of crisis, the agricultural sector has served as a business opportunity and an alternative to other more harshly affected sectors, associated with new technologies and innovation (for example, on-line shopping and home delivery) that have proven a major opportunity to be taken advantage of. Although the country is dependent on the importation of basic foodstuffs such as grains, sugar, cooking oils, milk and several by-products due to its agricultural and geo - logical specificities, agriculture nevertheless shows some potential for the development 62of fruit cultivation, horticulture, animal hus - bandry, namely with animals with a short production cycle, and agroindustry, in order to contribute, in part, to the food and nutritional security of families. Cabo Verdean authorities are aware that: The market for Cabo Verdean agricultural products could quickly reach 1.5 million consumers, some 1 million of which are of considerable purchasing power, and that this potential demand presents positive opportunities in the fresh produce mar - ket (vegetables, tubers, tropical fruits and industrial farm products such as meats and eggs). Agriculture also presents a certain potential for the development of fruit farming, vege- table farming and animal husbandry, namely that of animals with short production cycles, as well as agroindustry. Agriculture in Cabo Verde does not, however, have the structural conditions necessary to produce all of the food its population requires, and, as such, remains highly dependent on imports. With current levels of water and land availability and with the same existing agroclimatic conditioning factors, the country could produce more and better with modernization and more intelligent and resilient technological options. Given that Cabo Verde is a small island state vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change, the transformation of agriculture requires adaptation to climate change and resilience, and, as such, the implementation of measures to prevent and mitigate these effects must be accelerated. Cabo Verdean authorities intend to over - come these challenges and leverage the agricultural economy, and will promote the conditions necessary to significantly increase production, productivity and added value in agriculture, foster the transition from traditional and subsistence farming to modern, competitive agriculture able to attract private investment and enhance its contribution to food security, penetrate the tourism market and export. They will also promote conditions to turn agriculture into a new sector of opportunities for young people, one able to generate decent jobs and incomes and one that, above all, can contribute to the reduction of inequalities, poverty and regional asymmetries. In order for this transformation to take place, Cabo Verdean authorities: Will promote corporatization, the develop- ment of productive systems (family units, production cooperatives or businesses) that are technologically modern, profitable and environmentally sustainable - in other words, a new model implying a more robust and resilient agrarian economy that generates more employment and income for families, especially in rural areas, and increases the sector's contribution to the GDP; Will invest in the creation and aggregation of value throughout the entire market chain with regards to its linkage with the sectors of tourism, the manufacturing industry and trade itself, contributing toward attracting large-scale investment. They will also invest in policies providing incentive to taking better advantage of agricultural possibilities associ - ated with the promotion of entrepreneurship in the sector; Will invest strongly in salt and sea water desalinization techniques and in the safe reutilization of treated wastewater to com- plement the mobilization of surface and underground water. Added to this will be a policy of massification of efficient irrigation systems (with an emphasis on micro-irriga - tion systems), soil conservation, overcoming the scale effect and the adoption and use of clean energies, which will consequently promote a reduction in production costs. For this to occur, they will promote effective participation on the part of the private sector and civil society in the definition of strategic policies for the agricultural sector in order to supplant challenges. 63 SDG 3. QUALITY HEALTH64SDG 3. QUALITY HEALTH Ensuring access to quality healthcare and promoting well-being for all, at all ages. After making great progress - in particular meeting the Millennium Development Goals related to mortality among children under 5 and maternal mortality in 2015 - significant progress has been made in the last five years in the field of health, with the strengthening of the leadership, governance and regulation of the sector, the creation of a regulatory entity and a more favorable environment for private initiative and public-private partnerships, as well as the consolidation of health regions and regional hospitals. Through an ambitious infrastructure pro - gram, the network of health facilities has been strengthened and medical and hos - pital equipment in regional health centers and hospitals has been modernized, as has medical diagnosis capacity in the areas of laboratory and imaging, as well as in the pro - vision of oral health care and physiotherapy. Important investments have been made in central hospitals and in equipment for clinical laboratory services, neonatology, pediatrics, gastroenterology and digestive endoscopy, imaging, and the National Institute of Public Health was consolidated with the expansion of the network of public health laboratories, creating skills in the areas of virology and entomology. Cabo Verde has health indicators among the best in sub-Saharan Africa, with a life expectancy of 77.0 years, 73.4 for men and 80.7 years for women. The NHS is now better prepared to respond to challenges, namely in the provision of healthcare, surveillance and security, prevention and health promotion. The COVID-19 pandemic substantially expanded the role of the State and the health emergency took its place at the center of priorities, involving an essential part of public structures, and in particular, of the National Health System, civil protection and the pub - lic safety system, but also of civil society organizations. In line with best international practices, Cabo Verdean authorities mobi - lized society, municipalities, the business sector, NGOs and development partners to fight the pandemic and especially to preserve the health and life of Cabo Verdeans and to prepare for the recovery of tourism and the internal and international mobility necessary for the recovery of economic growth. With the onset of the pandemic, Cabo Verdean authorities reoriented budget pri - orities, interrupting fiscal consolidation and the reduction of public debt and amending the 2020 budget to reinforce the National Health System in an amount equivalent to about 5% public expenditure in order to meet the primary priority of saving lives, including the reinforcement of budget allocations for the adaptation of NHS structures, medi - cines, the reinforcement of human resources, protection and life insurance, actions to strengthen the health response to COVID-19, prevention and combat, capacity building and 65 decentralization of the Virology Laboratory, and henceforth the start of vaccination to cover 70% of the population in 2021 and the population as a whole in 2022. The pandemic has tested the capacities and resilience of the national health system and the mobilization of Cabo Verdean soci- ety and development partners for health. However, in addition to these emerging chal - lenges, others persist, such as improving access to healthcare, promoting equity, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, the involvement of diaspora professionals and specialists, the reinforcement of human resources and their continuous capacity building, and especially the increase in the participation of the private sector in this field. The maternal mortality rate increased con- siderably in 2019, reaching 105.5 per 100,000 live births, the highest level ever recorded and well above the average (37.6 per 100,000) of the last 4 years, and more than double the level reached in 2017, when it stood at 47.2 per 100,000 live births (in 2017).Remarkable progress has been made in the field of reproductive health, with the average number of children per woman dropping from 7 in 1981 to 2.5 in 2018, and this, associ - ated with investments in human capital and, in particular, in education and, globally, in health, is a determining factor in the ongoing demographic transition. In 2018, only 6.1% of births were not assisted by qualified health professionals (that is, doctors and nurses), which means an increase of 2.6 percentage points as compared to 2015, but in 2019 there was a strong deterioration - in that year, only 88.4% of births were assisted by health professionals, a reduction of 2.5 percentage points compared to the previous year and 1.9 compared to 2015. In 2019, infant mortality rate reached 15.6 per 1,000 live births, a slight increase of about 0.5 percentage points above the 2015 level, after significant improvements in 2018, when it reached 14.6 per 1,000 live births. Thus, the survival of children under 5 years did not improve. The Early Neonatal Mortality Rate has decreased slightly, settling in 2019 at 7.2 deaths per 1,000 live births, or about 0.9 percentage points below the 2015 level, while late neonatal mortality worsened, reaching, in 2019, 3.4 deaths per 1,000 live births, about 1.4 percentage points above 2015. However, in Cabo Verde, both neonatal and infant mortality are at levels below the SDG target and it is considered that the coun- try may, well before 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 1 year of age. In 2019, there were 62.5 new cases of HIV infection per 100,000 inhabitants, down from 2015 when 74.9 new cases of infection were registered, but especially from the previous year when it worsened, with 92.4 being registered. According to the IDSR III, the seroprevalence rate for HIV1 in the 15- to 49-year-old population is 0.4%, standing at 0.6% among women and 0.2% among men. When HIV2 is included, the seropreva - lence rate stands at 0.6%, with 0.7% among women and 0.4% among men. Most of the new cases reported in 2019 belong to the 25-49 age group (average of 12.2%), a stage in which people are more sexually active, but this trend does not differ from 2015. Table 3.

There is a marked trend towards a reduction in incidence and, if this continues, Cabo Verde has a high likelihood of reaching the SDG target, which is to eliminate tubercu- losis as a public health problem in 2030 (Incidence rate < 10/100,000 inhabitants). Furthermore, there has been no shortage of medicine to treat tuberculosis cases in the country. The malaria incidence rate ranged between 0.09 and 0.14 for every 1,000 inhabitants in the 2015-2016 period, but in 2017 there was a considerable increase in malaria cases and, consequently, an increase in the incidence rate to 0.83 per 100 inhabitants. However, thanks to prevention measures, no autochthonous cases have been registered since 2018, which is one of the criteria for certifying the elimination of malaria as a public health problem in Cabo Verde. The hepatitis incidence rate reached, in 2019, 26.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, which represents a strong decrease compared to 2015, when it reached 54.5 per 100,000 inhabitants, or more than double the last year under analysis. The level of hepatitis incidence in 2019 is, however, much higher than the previous year (16.9 per 100,000), but 2016 was the worst year in that period with an incidence of 70 per 100,000 inhabitants. Available data mentions only hepatitis and does not differentiate between the variants, but according to the health authority, most cases in the country stem from hepatitis B. Table 6.

Respiratory affections are the second cause of death, representing 74.3 per 100,000 inhabitants. Tumors or neoplasms are the third leading cause of death, corresponding to 61.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2019.Mortality rates from intentionally self-in - flicted injuries (suicide) have been decreasing since 2015, when they reached 25.5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, registering 19.1 per 100,000 in the last year under analysis (2019), which is also below the previous year (21.1 per 100,000 inhabitants). The traffic accident rate is relatively high, and deaths from road accidents represented 0.96% of total deaths in 2020. However, the mortality rate from road accidents declined from 1.3% in 2015 to 0.78% in 2019, and worsened in 2020 (0.96%), at about half of the 2015 level. According to the IDSR III carried out by INE, in 2018, in Cabo Verde, 82 out of every 100 women who are married or living with their partners seek family planning services, a demand that is higher than that of all sexually active single women and women not cohabiting (72%), without significant differences between urban and rural areas. The rate of family planning needs met reached 50.75%, being 57.5% among the first and lower, (44%) among those in the second group. As a result, about 21.6% of women who seek family planning services are not able to obtain them, which represents unmet needs, a figure higher among married women or women with live-in partners (24.6%) than among all single women or women in sexually active non-unions (18.5%). Demand for family planning is higher among women aged 25-29 (85.0%), but it is in the 30-34 age group that the rate of needs met is higher (67.6%), both among married/cohabiting women (65.6%) as among all sexually active women and single/in sexually active non-co - habiting women (56.4%). The level of education does not determine significant differences in the demand for family planning, except for women without any education. Table 8.

According to IDSR III, around 11.7% of 15- to 19-year-old women declared they had already had a live-born child, 3.5 pp below the 2005 level. 6% of girls have already had a live-born child, roughly double the 2005 level, a year in which around 1.9% of teenagers of this age reported having had a live-born child. At 19 years of age, around 28.9% of teenagers have already had a live-born child. According to the Non-Communicable Diseases Risk Factor Survey (IDNT II -2020), the average age of smoking initiation in Cabo Verde is 18.9 years, 19 years among men and 18.4 years among women. The prevalence of smoking among people aged 15 and over is 9.6% and among people aged 18 to 69 years is higher among men (15.7%) than among women (3.2%). Cabo Verde's success in the field of health has to do, above all, with the preventive aspect and, especially, with the high vacci - nation coverage of children. This is indeed a good practice that has allowed the country to avoid many inequities - that is, to reduce avoidable inequalities in health care. In 2018, about 94.6% of children under one year of age were fully vaccinated, with the coverage rate of 95.8% for BCG vaccina - tion and 97% against Pentavalent Polio 3, above 2015 levels. Thus, we guarantee high levels of vaccination coverage for children and introduced the HPV vaccine into the national vaccination calendar. In these past 5 years, there has been an effective reinforcement of health profes- sionals, in both numbers and diversity, but both are still insufficient, particularly with regard to professionals specialized in various domains, both clinical as well as public health and management.Thus, the ratio of Health Professionals per 10,000 inhabitants reached 58.8 in 2019, about 6.2 points above the 2015 level. Contributing to this ratio is a positive evolution in the number of doctors, which went from 338 in 2017 to 442 in 2019, in the number of nurses, from 757 nurses in 2017 to 772 in 2019, in the number of level I technicians from various areas of expertise, such as physiotherapy, psychology, clinical analysis laboratory and administration area personnel, who rose from 321 to 369, in 2019, and due to the fact that the number of specialist physicians rose from 182 to 259. Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Devel - opment Agenda proposes to guarantee access to quality healthcare and pro - mote wellbeing for everyone at all ages, creating value for the economy. Thus, it proposes to ensure, during this year, the vaccination of at least 70% of the popula - tion against COVID-19 and to make vacci - nation universal in 2022, institutionalize the family physician system, strengthen national psychiatric and mental health coverage in the primary care network, expand the coverage network of care related to the abusive use of alcohol and other drugs, strengthen health centers' supply of medical consultations in spe - cialized medical fields, implement the training program for health technicians, including epidemiologists, and expand the network of health centers.

QUALITY EDUCATION70SDG 4. QUALITY EDUCATION Education and training are fundamental foundations for the country's development and for personal, professional and social achievement on the part of citizens. The Government of Cabo Verde is aware that quality education for all requires interven - tions that take into account the challenges of education in society, invest in and opt for providing an education of excellence, equity and inclusiveness as one of its main objectives, through an educational system integrated into the concept of the economy of knowledge and a school and university environment with a culture of research, experimentation and innova - tion that can help Cabo Verdeans master languages, science and technology, with a cosmopolitan profile in their relation - ship with the world and which is imbued with values and motivations for life-long learning and which takes into account issues related to sustainability, intercul -turality, equality, identity, participation in the democratic process, innovation and creativity - in other words, education for the full understanding and enjoyment of citizens' rights and duties. This ambition is translated into the progress we will discuss below. The first evaluation of student competen- cies in intermediate years, specifically in 2nd and 6th grades, carried out in 2019 by Cabo Verdean authorities on performance in Portuguese and Mathematics from the beginning of schooling, revealed that: Most (61.8%) of students evaluated showed a good reading capacity, and 45 out of every 100 showed a reasonable capacity in the realm of writing. However, only 9.1% of students evaluated managed to meet the objectives of the evaluation - in other words, apply basic knowledge in the scope of language structure, and 21.3% demon - strated considerable difficulty.Some 14.9% of those whose performance was not as expected in the realm of reading demonstrated difficulties, 21.3% were unable to carry out the exercise and 1.9% of stu- dents failed to respond. With regards to the explicit knowledge of the language required by understanding and interpreting the basic rules of the functioning of the language, 6 out of every 10 children demonstrated difficulties - in other words, a majority of the students were unable to answer or had major difficulty answering the questions formulated to them. 21.3% demonstrated difficulty, 37.4% were unable to answer adequately and 4.6% did not respond. According to the Contextual Analysis Report, students showed numerous difficulties solving exercises in the three main areas of mathematics assessed: numbers and operations, data organization and treatment and geometry and measurements. In the realm of numbers and operations, 19.4% of students were able to respond as expected, 46.7% did so with difficulty, 33.4% were unable to answer appropriately and 0.5% did not answer. In terms of data organization and treatment, some 29.7% of students assessed answered as expected, while 23.8% demonstrated difficulty. Some 45.2% of students assessed were unable to answer appropriately, while 1.3% did not respond. In the area of geometry and measurements, 12.6% of students managed to respond 71 correctly or with minimal errors, and 1 in 3 demonstrated difficulties. Most (53.1%) were unable to answer adequately, while 1.2% did not respond. The Cabo Verdean government is aligned with the global understanding that the early childhood period is essential for the integral development of children throughout their lives, and, as such, proposed the imple - mentation of a formal universal, quality pre-school education system within the framework of the 2017-2021 Strategic Edu- cation Plan, which promotes access for all 4- and 5-year-old children to this level of learning. In the 2019/2020 school year, a coverage rate of 81.6% was achieved, representing a slight increase of 0.6 percentage points over the 2016/2017 school year, with no difference seen between males and females. Coverage is high because 4 out of every 5 children ages 4 and 5 attend this level of schooling, and there is balance in terms of access between boys and girls. Cabo Verdean authorities have prioritized the approval of a regulatory framework that promotes and regulates this sub-system and improves the quality of the education provided to 4- and 5-year-old children, preparing them to enter mandatory Ele - mentary-level schooling. In mandatory elementary schooling, Cabo Verdean authorities intend to ensure free, equitable and quality access up to the 8th grade through the Strategic Education Plan. The first eight years of elementary school were made mandatory and free of charge beginning in the 2017/2018 school year, with a particular highlight being the implemen - tation of a number of strategic measures such as free and equitable access, the requalification and improvement of edu - cational infrastructures, improvements in quality, the inclusion of children and youth with special educational needs, the pro - motion of learning geared towards active study and life, and the reinforcement of institutional and organizational capacity. In 2021/2020, the net rate of schooling reached 92.4%, a rate 6.4 percentage points higher than the level seen in the 2016/2017 school year. Internal effectiveness also improved, as the passing rate reached 90.3%, some 4.3 percentage points above the 86% recorded in the 2016/2017 school year. Table 12.

It is also an effect of the increase in coverage of the school lunch program, which encom- passed 100% of 1st to 6th grade students and 85% of 7th and 8th grade students, who previously did not benefit from the program, as well as school busing. Also of note was the improvement in the quality of the teaching and learning process, with the total revision of the elementary school curriculum plan organized into two cycles, the first running from 1st to 4th grade and the second running from 5th to 8th grade. In addition, subjects are now taught separately beginning in the 5th grade, and foreign languages (French and English) were introduced, as was ICT in a modular format. In secondary education, Cabo Verdean authorities intend to improve access, quality and relevance in harmony with the development of the country through the adoption of high-impact measures, such as the qualitative improvement in access to general and technical secondary edu - cation, the elimination of the payment of tuition up to the 12th grade and the option of technical secondary education beginning in 9th grade, guaranteeing conditions of permeability between general and technical education, the conclusion of the curricular revision currently under way for both general and technical secondary schooling and the reinforcement of institutional and organi - zational capacity. In the 2020/2021 school year, the net rate of schooling reached 61.2%, a figure 8.1 percentage points higher than that seen in the 2016/2017 school year. Some 4% of secondary school students were enrolled in technical education in the 2020/2021 school year. In technical education, schools already have an accreditation license that allows them to administer professional training courses listed in the National Qualifications Catalogue (CNQ), thus fostering a diversifi- cation of educational offerings both in tech - nical schooling and professional training. Cabo Verdean authorities intend to promote the equitable and sustainable development of higher education, articulating it with research in consonance with the country's socioeconomic and cultural development with access to regulated and equitable higher education, remote learning integrated into higher education, quality higher edu - cation, development and employment in higher education, the strategic planning of higher education and the development of science and innovation. The higher education access rate of youth aged between 18 and 24 is currently 23.5%, practically similar to the figure registered in 73 2016/2017, and there remains an enormous disparity between males and females, with 150 for every 100 men in higher learning. Other strategic measures have been implemented as well, with an impact on the improvement of responses in the edu - cation sector, namely: the extension and improvement of the school social action program, benefiting thousands of students with school kits, school lunches, school transportation, textbooks, scholarships and tuition subsidies; the creation of conditions to able to take better advantage of ICTs in the development of teaching and learning processes; improvement in the operational conditions of the network and, consequently, of teaching and learning processes; and guaranteeing the rights of faculty and other professionals in the education sector. We are living in a digital age, and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are essential in accelerating the modernization of both central and local public administra -tion to better serve citizens and businesses, promoting transparency in management of the public trust, improving the business environment and, above all, improving the efficiency and productivity of businesses and accelerating and reinforcing participation on the part of diaspora communities, with the Internet a fundamental pillar in this scenario. According to the 2019 Continuous Multi-Pur - pose Inquiry, some 88% of the population aged 10 and over claimed to have copied or moved files or folders, and 83.5% claimed to have used copy-paste commands to dupli-cate or move information. 62.8% claimed to have sent e-mails with updated files, revealing the areas in which the popu - lation is most skilled in the use of ICTs. On the other extreme, 14.4% and 12.1% of the population affirm they have the skills necessary to install or replace operating systems or create computer programs using programming language, respectively. In pre-school education, parity stands at 0.98 - in other words, there are 98 girls attending pre-school for every 100 boys, meaning that full parity has not been achieved. In 2019/2020, the Parity Index stood at 93% in Mandatory Elementary Education, with 93 girls attending school for every 100 boys, meaning that, at this level as well, full parity was not achieved. Thus, the challenge of parity remains on this level of schooling, even though the difference is not significant. In Secondary Education, the Parity Index stands at 1.2 - in other words, 120 girls attend for every 100 boys. In higher learning in the 2019/2020 academic year, the Parity Index stood at 1.5 - in other words, there were 150 girls attending higher education for Table 13.

In this case, the disadvan - tage for males is much more accentuated than in secondary school. In Cabo Verde, the vast majority of the population 15 years of age and over knows how to read and write. The literacy rate reached 88.5% in 2019, some 0.9 percentage points higher than in 2016. The literacy rate is higher among men (93.1%) than among women (83.9%), which reveals inequality in terms of access. However, nearly all young people aged 15-24 (98.8%) know how to read and write, with there being practically no difference between genders. Young people's level of literacy is the result of the national effort to ensure access to and participation in the educational process from pre-school all the way to higher learning and including elemen - tary education for adults and the reduction in asymmetries in access to education. In order to materialize the government's educational policy, the Strategic Educa - tion Plan is aimed at ensuring the full achievement of governing principles of guaranteeing quality education to all Cabo Verdeans, reducing inequalities throughout Cabo Verdean territory with a focus on the specificities of its popu - lation and exercising active citizenship, incorporating the principles of respect for human rights, social and environmental sustainability, and the value of diversity and social inclusion. In this context, a number of achievements on the level of education for citizenship may be highlighted within the scope of the new educational project: The creation within the structure of the Ministry of Education of an Educational Inclusion and Citizenship Promotion Service, a part of the National Directorate of Educa - tion, to better respond to human rights and citizenship issues. Within the scope of the revision of the Elementary Education curriculum, the mainstreaming of contents in all elemen - tary education programs from 1st to 8th grade was analyzed and carried out. The Project for the development of socio-emotional skills encompasses teacher training and the production of teaching materials. The Program for the Promotion of Citizenship in Elementary and Secondary Education was updated from the perspective of thematic mainstreaming and inclusive education to be used in Educational Inclusion Spaces and schools' citizenship programs. In partnership with the Cabo Verdean Gender Equality and Equity Institute (ICIEG): The guide for secondary school faculty entitled \"Education for Equality\" was elaborated in 2018/2019, as was the \"Educating for Equality\" textbook for secondary school students; In 2019, a paper on \"Education for Sexu - ality and Other Crosscutting Themes\" was In 2020/2021, the for two\" was produced. Law-Decree n\u00ba 47/2017 was approved, establishing social and school support measures aimed at ensuring mothers can access and remain in the education system in a quality manner. Table 15.

The \"Peer Education\" Project was imple - mented in partnership with the Coordina - tion Council on AIDS, as were various radio programs on citizenship issues. In Cabo Verde nearly all schools (97.6%) have access to drinking water, with a similar percentage enjoying bathroom installations (98.9%), allowing for hand-washing installa - tions in at least 90 out of every 100 schools. The vast majority (89%) of elementary and secondary schools are hooked up to the public electricity grid, thus allowing for the use of ICTs, but access to and use of the Internet for educational purposes is still limited, as only 17 out of every 100 schools have this facility. The requalification and improvement of edu - cational infrastructures is one of the priorities of the 2017-2021 Strategic Education Plan, and this component is operationalized by the School Network Rehabilitation Plan and the objectives of Elementary Education. With the adoption of school groupings, a new model was implemented for the configura - tion of the school network, and within the framework of the National School Network Rehabilitation and Expansion Plan for the 2016-2020 horizon, a total of 200 schools were rehabilitated and 8 new establishments built, considerably more than the 266 classrooms forecast in the Strategic Education Plan. In addition, a platform was instituted for the management of educational infrastructures. Education of Excellence is one of the pro - grams of the 2017-2021 PEDS, made opera - tional by the 2017-2021 Strategic Education Plan. The volume of public resources allocated to this program in 2020 reached some US$ 93.2 million, the equivalent of 1.4 times the expenses effected to the same purpose in 2015, representing annual growth of 6.3% per year. Donations (non-debt-producing financing) reached some US$ 1 million and represented 76 approximately 1.1% of public expenditures from the Education of Excellence Program, some 0.2 percentage points above 2015, with 2020 levels resulting from annual average growth of 9.3% over five years. The volume of public expenditures with scholarships reached US$ 6.4 million, the equivalent of 1.1 times the expenditures for this item in 2015, representing growth of 1.8% per year. In Cabo Verde, nearly all elementary school teachers (98.7%) are specifically trained to be faculty at this level. The issue of the qualification of professionals is particularly pertinent in pre-school education, in which fewer than 30 out of every 100 professionals are specifically qualified to attend to chil - dren. As such, the reinforcement of training and capacity building for professionals and administrators of pre-school education establishments is one of the priorities of the 2017-2021 Strategic Education Plan. The educational project currently under way reflects the SDGs and should assist in the global achievement of the goals in cross-cutting areas such as poverty reduction, gender equality, reduction in inequalities, sustainable consumption and health. The 2017-2021 Strategic Education Plan is perfectly aligned with SDG4 and calls for the carrying out of reforms and investments to achieve the goal. As such, within the framework of the mea - sures and policies for the education sector, the government shall, in the next budget cycles: Guarantee access to and the conclusion of a quality education for all children and youth, oriented toward the needs of the job market; Guarantee greater equality and inclusion in education for all students and youth, through the development and implemen - tation of transformative public policies that respond to the diversity and to their own needs; Promote wide and flexible lifelong learning opportunities that are of sufficient quality to generate relevant, equitable and efficient learning results at all levels of education.Within the Framework of the Cabo Verde 2030 Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda, Cabo Verdean authorities plan to consolidate access and promote a quality formal universal pre-education system for all 4- to 5-year-olds, increasing the current coverage rate. In order to meet this ambition, Cabo Verdean authori - ties have recentered their attention on learning, as established by SDG4, which aims to ensure access for all to quality education on equal terms and to pro - mote learning possibilities throughout people's lives. This goal calls for the effective acquisition of fundamental and transferrable skills as the basis of lifelong learning. It also implies focusing on the pertinence of learning both for the job market and for individuals' personal, civic and social life. This recentering has implications in those domains essential to improving learning processes and results, and implies, namely, education, training and professional development for faculty, the elaboration of programs, the conception of support material for teaching and learning and the evaluation of learning acquisition.

GENDER EQUALITY78SDG 5. GENDER EQUALITY In Cabo Verde, women - 49% of the popula - tion - have a greater life expectancy, as they can expect to live 80,7 years, compared to 73,4 for men. They are more educated - that is, they have an average of 8.7 years of schooling, against 7.7 for men, and have an average of 2.5 children. The Constitution of the Republic of Cabo Verde establishes equality between women and men as an essential part of Cabo Verdean legislation. Gender policies are produced within an integrated institutional architec - ture, with the Ministry of Family, Inclusion and Social Development, the Cabo Verdean Institute for Gender Equality and Equity, the Inter-ministerial Commission for the Main - streaming of the Gender Approach, and the Gender Observatory. Social Services, which are currently decentralized in municipal govern- ments, contribute with specific programs and services that promote gender equality. Gen- der equality is also part of sectoral policies, such as those relating to rural development and especially the Rural Socio-Economic Opportunities Program, water and sanitation, energy, education and training, sexual health and reproductive health and tourism. The National Gender Equality and Equity Plans are approved by Resolution of the Council of Ministers and thus have the force of law. The Strategic Sustainable Development Plan is approved by the Council of Ministers and, in addition to the \"Gender Equality\" program, it ensures the mainstreaming of gender in all other programs. Cabo Verdeans demonstrate a preference for being single. However, according to the IDSR III carried out in 2018 by the INE, among women aged 20 to 24, married or in cohabitation, 1.8% entered into a relationship for the first time before the age of 15 and 8.4% before the age of 18. The IDSR III is the main source of data on female genital mutilation or cutting, but it does not report any cases in Cabo Verde. It is admitted, however, that there were rare cases among the foreign Muslim population, which in 2010 stood at 6,008 people, equivalent to 1.2% of Cabo Verde's resident population, of which 10 out of every 100 are women. According to the 3rd Demographic and Repro - ductive Health Survey (IDSR III, 2019), 11% of women aged 15-49 have suffered physical violence in the past 12 months and the same proportion of women 15 and older have been victims of this type of violence at some time. About 3% of women in this age group were victims of acts of sexual violence in the last 12 months before the survey and 6% of women in this same group declared they had been victims of this type of violence at some point. Just over one in ten women (14%) had expe- rienced emotional marital violence in the last 12 months before the survey. IDSR III does not report cases of female genital mutilation or cutting in Cape Verde. 79 In terms of women's political participation, the country made history with the approval of the Parity Law (n\u00ba 68/IX/2019) in 2019. The application of this law has com - pletely changed the scenario for women's representation in parliament and in local governments. With the municipal elections held on October 25, 2020, we now have 200 women in Local Power, representing 42% of local elected representatives for Municipal Chambers or Assemblies. With the legislative elections held on April 18 of the current year, women now hold 38% of parliamentary seats and represent 32% in the new Government. Cabo Verde is endowed with laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access for women and men aged 15 and over to care, information and education on sexual and reproductive health. The low presence of women in agricul - ture is also worrying, given the high rates of female poverty in rural areas and the lack of employment alternatives in this area. Men represent 53% of agricultural producers, while women represent 47%, playing a preponderant role in agricultural economic activity in rural areas. About 74.6% of the population is employed in agriculture, livestock or fishing. Women now have more power to decide how many children to have, when to have them, with whom to have them and at what intervals, and they have an average of 2.5 children. Thus, about 53% of women aged 15-49 who had had a child in the last 5 years stated that the pregnancy was desired. About 43% of women aged 15-49 use at least one contraceptive method and 53% of women decide on their own which contraceptive method to use. Cabo Verde is endowed with laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access for women and men aged 15 and over to care, information and education in sexual and reproductive health.The Constitution guarantees women's equal right to ownership and/or control of land. However, this is not always reflected in practice as a consequence of land issues. According to the Continuous Multiobjective Survey (IMC) carried out by INE, in 2019, 71.7% of the population aged 10 years or more has at least one mobile phone, 72.5% for men and 70.8% for women with sensi- tive differences among urban areas, where 76.4% of people have them, against 62% in rural areas. In urban areas, 76.5% of men have at least one mobile phone, against 64.4% for women, while in rural areas 76.3% of men own this equipment against only 59.5% of women. Cabo Verde's economy today has a greater capacity to generate employment for men than for women. Thus, the employment rate is 39% for women against 51% for men. Informality affects women less than men, as 80only 48% of employed women have informal employment against 55% for men. Women are the majority of domestic workers, in health, education, accommodation and catering, trade and manufacturing, while men predominate in construction, public administration, agriculture and livestock, transport and storage and other economic activities. Women are rarely present in technological and scientific areas, traditionally considered male dominated, which is also worrying con - sidering the fact that the accelerators identi - fied to leverage full productive employment and guarantee social protection concern highly masculinized sectors - namely the renewable energy sectors, the blue economy, the digital economy, agriculture and creative industries. The private sector provides 4 out of every 10 jobs and employs approximately 1 in 2 men and fewer than 1 in 3 women. In 2020, the poor were distributed almost equally between the two genders, but absolute poverty is more prevalent among households represented by women (24.8%) than among those represented by men (14.0%), and thus about 67% of poor house- holds are represented by women. From the point of view of equal access to education, the situation of girls is clearly advantageous in relation to that of boys. They are the ones who attend most, drop out least and perform the best. 56% of young people 25-35 years old with complete higher education are women. 38% of women 15 - 35 years old have at least completed secondary education, against 29% of men. Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda raises the ambition of Cabo Verdeans and authorities for a Cabo Verde without gender discrimination, which invests in equal opportunities and capitalizes on the contributions of women and men to economic growth and sustainable development for the country. It also promotes economic opportunities for women, particularly in the areas of renewable energies, the blue economy, the digital economy and agriculture, and improvements in their integration in the labor market, taking into account regional dimensions and the poorest groups; stimulates diversified educational and professional paths for girls and women, in the fields of science, technology and research; deepens the equal participation of women and men in spaces and positions of power and decision; and develops policies and measures to eliminate all forms of gender-based violence. 81 Good practices: Gender equality in Cabo Verde Cabo Verde was considered a reference in Africa in terms of Gender Equality by UN Women in February 2021, in the midst of the pandemic. The merit of this distinction focused on a policy taken up by national authorities and assimilated by the civil society, which chose the banner of mainstreaming as central to public policies, with a view to promoting development that promotes an egalitarian and tolerant culture and that leaves no one behind. The banner of mainstreaming was taken up at the macro, meso and micro levels, and the commitment to a culture of results allowed the country to produce statistical data bro - ken down by sex to the point of ensuring the reliability of the design of equity policies accompanied by a thorough follow-up of the goals set. Gender-sensitive budgeting, with the intro- duction of gender markers in the budget sys -tem, the mainstreaming of gender equality in tourism, which makes the unique in the world with this vision, the introduction of the gender equality module in secondary education, with teachers duly prepared for this unprecedented challenge in Africa, while introducing another module on gender equality in professional training courses, make Cabo Verde a country of reference in Africa in terms of taking on the challenge of mainstreaming gender equality. Cabo Verde has opted for education for equality and focuses on training teachers 82 and students. It ensures pregnant students remain in school while at the same time it works to counter violence in dating and teenage pregnancy. At the same time, various legislative mea - sures accompany this gradual evolution towards equality. Gender-Based Violence, considered a crime of priority prevention, is legally considered a public crime in Cabo Verde. The GBV law, which has already been evaluated in its applicability, is known by the entire population. The law in question (considered one of the most advanced in the world, makes it mandatory for those aware of incidents to report them to authorities and impossible for criminal complaints to be retracted), has now been introduced in the penal code. In terms of Gender-based Violence, data from the last Survey on Sexual and Reproductive Health, which are contained in the online gender observatory, lodged on the INE web - site, reveals a considerable reduction in GBV (12%) in the country and the denaturalization of violence. In addition, measures such as the creation of courts specialized in GBV, shelters and specialized service professionals who operate in all municipalities in the country are particularly important features. The country is aware that the fight for equal - ity is only effective if the strategy includes men. In this sense, awareness-building to promote new masculinities has had visible results. In Cabo Verde, numbers speak for them - selves with regards to gender participation in education: girls are more numerous in education and stand out at the university level. The archipelago tops the list of African countries with the highest number of girls in education, to the point that the authorities are considering the introduction of positive discrimination measures in favor of boys. We are also the first African country to join the global platform for the rights of LBGTI people. Cabo Verde has just been elected a member of the commission on the statutes of women for 2022-2026. This investment in the care system, so that women can be freed up for other public spheres, has already under - scored the urgency of the formalization of the informal sector, so that women can be at the center of the post-Covid economic recovery, and the country is about to proceed with an increase in of maternity and paternity leave. 83 SDG 6. DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION84SDG 6. DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION After having largely surpassed the targets of the Millennium Development Goals, over the past 5 years Cabo Verde has made notable progress in the realm of water and sanitation, despite the occurrence of three consecutive years of drought. This progress is reflected in the reform of the sector, especially in the corporatization of water and sanitation services, resulting in gains for consumers, as well as in terms of urban solid waste management. This performance reflects the importance Cabo Verdean authorities attribute to the mobilization and distribution of water for household consumption and in the economy, particularly in the last 5 years. Although the country was faced with the most severe series of persistent and con - secutive droughts of the last 37 years in 2017, 2018 and 2019, extreme events aggra - vated by climate change and which reduced the country's ground water storage and mobilization capacity, Cabo Verde never - theless achieved considerable gains. Indeed, the proportion of the population obtaining drinking water from a safe source grew slightly to reach 85.5%, some 0.4 percentage points above 2015 levels, while even more importantly 69 out of every 100 individuals have the public water grid as their main supply source, some 4.9 percentage points above 2015 levels. Despite chronic water scarcity, Cabo Verde is considerably above the regional average in terms of access to drinking water. In 2019, 71.7% of homes were connected to the public grid as their main source of water. The urban/rural gap has slowly diminished since 2000, but remains significant (some 10%). Important disparities remain from one municipality to another, even in the same island (for example, 18.7% in S\u00e3o Salvador do Mundo, 41% in S\u00e3o Domingos, 77.2% in Tarrafal, all of which are in Santiago) and between islands (for example, 50.1% in Boa Vista and 94.1% in Brava). 9.1% of families get their water supply from neighbors, 7.4% from nearby public wells, 8.6% from water tanks and 4.8% from other sources. When water must be gathered, women and girls are responsible for the task 70% of the time (78% in rural areas). Close to 85.2% of households have access to sanitation systems, a relatively high rate in comparison to most African coun- tries, and an increase of 7.8% since 2015. Only 8 municipalities, all of them poor municipalities in the island of Santiago, have a rate lower than the national aver - age. Even so, the lack of sanitation and the inadequate disposal of waste were, according to health statistics, considered one of the main causes of mortality (5th place), mainly among those under 5 years of age (3rd place). There persists a significant difference between urban and rural areas (92% versus 73%). In rural areas, 25.3% of the population has no bathroom installations in their homes. Recent investments in sewer networks have increased the number of wastewater treatment plants to 11 in five islands. In terms of water contamination, Table 17. Access to sanitation Indicator 2019 Population with bathroom installations (%) 85.1 Urban areas (%) 90.5 Rural areas (%) 74.0 Population with safe sanitary system (with bathroom installations hooked up to septic tank or sewer network) (%)82.4 Urban areas (%) 87.6 Rural areas (%) 71.8 Population that disposes of solid waste using garbage truck or garbage dumpster (%)84.4 Urban areas (%) 97.3 Rural areas (%) 54.7 Source: INE IMC 201985 in many areas wastewater is not treated, including industrial waste, and is discharged into the environment. Progress is also translated into the increase in per capita home consumption of running water from 38 liters a day in 2016 to 43.1 liters in 2019, this surpassing the target set for 2030 of 40 liters per person per day. Added to this is the reduction in technical losses, which dropped from 41.71% in 2016 to 31.45% in 2019, and the increase in the total volume of water mobilized by some 6.8% a year during the same period. This performance is due above all to the reforms still under way and which place Cabo Verde on the front lines of countries exhibiting best international practices in water and sanitation management. The country has modern legislation that includes a legal regime for water and sanitation and waste, as well as water and water ser - vice quality standards associated with a transparent and predictable tariff policy grounded in efficient technical and eco - nomic regularization. The sector's planning instruments enjoyed wide-reaching consen - sus in their elaboration and implementation. In 2019, 85 out of every 100 residents of Cabo Verde lived in housing with bathroom installations, with notable differences seen between urban areas, where 91 out of every 100 have these facilities in their homes, and rural areas, which 74 out of every 100 lived in housing with such installations. In that same year, some 82.4% of the population used a safe sanitation sys - tem, meaning they lived in housing whose bathroom installations were connected to septic tanks (52.9%) or to the sewer network (29.6%), with notable differences between urban areas, where 87.6% of the population used a safe sanitation system, and rural areas, where approximately 71.8% of the population had these facilities. In the urban milieu, the use of sewer networks is more expressive (45%), while in rural zones septic tanks predominate (68.8%), which is due mainly to the dispersion of housing, which makes investments in collective wastewater sanitation systems (sewer networks) less viable. 86As was referred to above, some 29.6% of the population was connected to the sewer network in 2019, which contributed to an increase in the volume of wastewater treated. Between 2015 and 2019, a significant increase in the volume of water collected and treated was registered, going from 993,417 m3 in 2015 to 2,700,106 m3 in 2019. The volume of non-debt-producing financing to the water and sanitation sector fell from US $ 16,378,092 in 2017 to 463,713 in 2020 - in other words, a 37-fold decrease in 3 years. Grants in 2017 represented 86% of global financing for the sector, a figure that fell to 32% in 2020. Cabo Verdean authorities have reiterated their commitment to ensuring the availability and sustainable management of drinking water and sanitation for all and, as such, will invest in improving the business environment to attract private investments in the expansion of mobilization and distribution of water for household consumption and in economic activities aimed at improving the quality of services and increasing the number of water, sanitation and solid urban waste service beneficiaries. Cabo Verdean authorities will create the conditions necessary for the massification of water supply networks, ensuring all households access to a water supply through the public grid, and for increasing average per capita consumption from 43 to 90 liters per day. They will also prioritize renewable energies to reduce the average cost of production and distribution per Kilowatt/cubic meter of desalinated water for household consumption, and will invest in the massification of desalinization of sea water in irrigated agriculture, as well as promote the universalization of tele-management for all water production and distribution systems nationwide. 87 SDG 7. RENEWABLE AND ACCESSIBLE ENERGY88SDG 7. RENEWABLE AND ACCESSIBLE ENERGY The Government of Cabo Verde has elected energy security, price stability and reduction of the energy bill as central concerns, duly established in the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan, in line with SDG 7, to be materialized through the National Energy Sustainability Program, aiming to make the transition to a safe, efficient and sustainable energy sector, reducing dependence on fos -sil fuels and guaranteeing universal access and energy security. Renewable energies are also among the 5 SDG accelerators identified by the \"SDG Roadmap\", roadmap for the Decade of Action. The country has made remarkable progress in the field of access to energy, but chal- lenges remain to be overcome. The rate of access to electricity reached 92.2% in 2019, compared to 86.5% in 2015, that is, only about 8 in every 100 people are in a situation of energy exclusion and belong to disadvantaged social strata and to popula - tion of remote areas of Cabo Verde. In 2019, about 92.5% of the female popula - tion had more access to electricity, against 91.9% among the male population. Access to electricity is higher in urban areas (94.1%) than in rural areas (88.4%), but it is worth highlighting na 8.8 pp increase in access in rural areas as compared to 2015. With a strong government commitment to strategic programs for the electricity sector, the Rural Electrification program was implemented, and in 2021 will lead to coverage of the entire national territory with electricity networks or micro-grids, representing a historic milestone for Cabo Verde and the culmination of an intense and systematic process. Cabo Verde intends to achieve, during the course of this year, the goal of SDG 7 at the global level, which is to reach 100% access by 2030. The Government of Cabo Verde approved and implemented the social electricity tariff regime and the National Domestic Energy Action Plan as a measure to pro - tect electricity consumers in a situation of eco\u00acnomic vulnerability. At the end of 2020, Cabo Verdean authorities adopted, a set of measures within the scope of the social emergency that include the digni - fied consumption of electricity for poor households, promoting the rationalization Table 18. Access to electric energy Indicator 2015 2019 Electricity access rate 86.5 92.2 Urban areas (%) 90.6 94.1 Rural areas (%) 79.6 88.4 Source: INE89 of energy consumption, the expansion of the social electricity tariff beneficiaries and, above all, the fight against commercial and technical losses. In terms of service quality, important progress has been made, with a reduction in frequency and average duration of service interruptions, increasing efficiency in the operation of electrical energy services with a reduction in losses. However, Cabo Verde still needs to overcome the challenge of efficiency - in other words, if the level of effectiveness of the net - work expansion strategy is satisfactory, it still needs to create conditions for resilience and sustainability of the sector, namely through fighting the high level of non-technical losses and improving operational efficiency of energy production, transport and distribution. Energy efficiency, measured in terms of primary energy and GDP, went from 1.41 toe/million escudos, in 2015, to 1.35 toe/ million, in 2019, which corresponds to a decrease of 6 pp in the last 4 years. In other words, significant changes are already taking place in the energy efficiency field. In 2019, around 78.3% of the population used mainly gas in cooking food, meaning they had primary access to fuels and clean technologies. This figure was around 7.9 pp above the 2015 level. Cabo Verde is a country where rain is scarce and with very little forest area. In many rural and peri-urban areas, firewood is still the primary energy source in food preparation, despite the limited potential for wood energy. The production of renewable energy has made important progress, reaching the peak of this period in 2018 and decreasing in 2020, due to the fall in energy demand as a result of the reduction in the volume of economic activity in the pandemic period. Thus, in 2020 it represented approximately 18.3% of total energy consumption, 2.0 percentage points lower than in 2014, indicating that growth progressed at a slower pace than total energy consumption. The forecast is to increase, by 2022, the penetration rate of renewable energies in the energy mix Table 19.

Renewable Energies Indicator 2018 2019 Renewable energy in % of total energy consumption 20.3 18.390from from 20.67% (2018) to 26.1%, with the implementation of ongoing projects (about 45 MW of additional renewable capacity). In 2018, Cabo Verde adopted the 2018-2040 Master Plan for the Electricity Sector, fore - casting a renewable energy penetration rate of around 30.2% in 2025 and 53.5% in 2030, representing investments of around 465.3 million dollars until 2030. Cabo Verde also approved the Electric Mobility Charter, and the action plan for operationalization and introduction of elec\u00actrical mobility intends to have thermal engines replaced by electric vehicles by 2050. Cabo Verde has opened a Center for Renew - able Energies and Industrial Maintenance (CERMI), which has benefited 558 young people over the past five years. The country also hosts the ECOWAS Center for Renewable Energies and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE). In Cabo Verde, energy efficiency, measured in terms of primary energy and GDP, went from 1.41 toe/million escudos in 2015 to 1.35 toe/million in 2019, which corresponds to a decrease of 6 pp in the last 4 years, revealing that significant changes are already being felt in the energy efficiency field. Cabo Verdean authorities have invested in capacity building and, through the Cen- ter for Renewable Energies and Industrial Maintenance (CERMI), 558 young people have benefited in the last 5 years from pro - fessional training in the field of renewable energies, with scholarships that globally reached a total of US$ 1,742,065, of which US$ 225,135 were financed by LuxDev. Some 88 young graduates have also benefited from professional internships in the area of vehicle maintenance. Public investments made from 2018 to 2020 in efficiency total around 4,824,441 dollars. In 2020, these investments represented 0.007% of GDP, well below the level of 2018, when it reached 0.2% of GDP. In the long term, the Government of Cabo Verde also highlights the strengthening of the Energy Sector Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation System, namely with the elabo- ration of the 2018-2040 Master Plan for the Electricity Sector, the legal and regulatory framework for the sector and the 2019-2050 Electric Mobility Action Plan. It is moving forward with the reform of the organiza - tional structure of the energy market, and has begun work on the restructuring and privatization of electricity utility ELECTRA and the strengthening of regulation. Cabo Verdean authorities have reinforced their commitment to guaranteeing access to reliable, sustainable and modern energy sources for all, and to this end, they are committed to accelerating the energy transition and decarbonizing Cabo Verde's economy, accelerating the process of transformation of the energy sector into a safe, efficient and sustainable sector, in order to move the country towards a low carbon economy while strengthening the country's economic competitiveness. They propose an energy policy focused on reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports and concerned with ensuring universal access to reliable, sustainable, modern and affordable energy for all. To this end, they are committed to the development of renewable energies in order to reach a penetration rate of at least 50% by 2030, taking advantage of the great potential of endogenous renewable resources, namely in wind and solar alternatives, whether in integrated production in the public electricity system, or in distributed generation. They are committed to road and maritime electric mobility for greater use of renewable energy and to be an important accelerator of the decarbonization of the country's economy. They are also committed to promoting energy efficiency as a key factor in reducing electricity costs, improving economic competitiveness and diversifying industrial activity. 91 SDG 8. DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH92SDG 8. DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH Cabo Verde is a country with a high level of inequalities and profound regional asymme - tries. Reducing these inequalities depends to a large degree on sustained economic growth, but growth in and of itself is not sufficient - in other words, the way wealth is generated and distributed is important as well. Work is and always must be chosen as the link connecting growth and human development. Work opportunity is one of the key elements in the promotion of decent work, which means, first and foremost, opportunities of productive work for women and men in conditions of freedom, equality, safety and human dignity for the wellbeing of workers and individuals in general. Between 2015 and 2020, real per capital GDP decreased on average 0.7% a year, an average that comes due to the 15.8% drop registered last year after 3.4% average growth in the first 4 years of the period. The reduction in real per capita GDP came due to the 14.8% economic recession that took place in 2020, and this, at least in part, explains the increase in poverty in the population, which saw its income levels decrease. Over the course of the 5 years in question, real GDP per employed person grew on average just 1.3% a year due to the 5.8% decrease in the figure seen in 2020 as a result of the 9.6% decrease in the size of the employed population. This rate, however, was lower than that of the economic reces -sion, and came after an average 3.1% growth per year in the first 4 pre-crisis years. The 4.7% average annual growth of the Cabo Verdean economy was, as such, insufficient to expand employment, but the country saw gains in productivity in the first four years of the cycle, gains that were, however, wiped out by the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the marked characteristics of the labor market in Cabo Verde is its informality, which is not dominated by agriculture, as in 2020, some 60% of informal jobs were non-agricultural in nature. Informal jobs represented 51.6% of total employment, with an average annual reduction of 1.9% since 2015. In general, women are at a disadvan -tage in the job market, as approximately 53.4% of NEET youth were female. Neverthe- less, the population of NEET youth (57,605) dropped considerably - on average, 4.1% a year until the last pre-pandemic year. As with underemployment, informality is more expressive in rural municipalities, where it represents more than 70% of all jobs. In Sal and Boa Vista, the most tourism-inten- sive municipalities, informal employment stands at just 23% and 30.7%, respectively. A considerable number of informal workers saw a drastic reduction in income due to the quarantine and to the drop in global demand. Outside of the agricultural sector, informality affects more men than women, as last year some 67.5% of informal jobs 93 among men were in non- agricultural sec - tors, against 51.8% for women. Both figures were below those registered in 2015, by 13.3 and 19.3 percentage points, respectively. Men devote more time to paid labor than do women. In 2020, some 31% of all employees worked fewer than 40 hours per week, with the figure standing at 28.1% for men and 35.3% for women. Indeed, in the 2020 IMC reference week, employed men worked on average 40.9 hours a week, approximately 3.6 hours more than employed women. In 2019, the majority of the employed popu - lation was male (54.6%) and resided mostly in urban areas (70.2%). 36% belonged to the 35- to 64-year-old age bracket, 43% had gone through elementary schooling and 62.7% worked in the tertiary sector. Some 53.9% of the unemployed population was male, the vast majority of which (78.2%) lived in urban areas. 44 out of every 100 were between 15 and 34 years of age and the majority (52.4%) had a high school edu - cation. The underemployed population is divided almost evenly between males and females. About half of the underemployed population (50.7%) lived in urban areas, and 48 out of every 100 underemployed individuals were between 15 and 34 years of age. Most (52.5%) had an elementary school education and 40 out of every 100 worked in the primary sector. The inactive population was mostly (59.1%) female, 36 out of every 100 were between 15 and 34 years of age, 60 out of every 100 resided in urban areas and 44 out of every 100 had a high school education. In 2020, with the outbreak of COVID-19, the microeconomic framework deteriorated, with the economy entering recession with a 14.8% drop in GDP that affected mainly the service sector, namely transportation, tourism, trade and other services, and the industrial sector. Both sectors were widely conditioned by the global lockdown. The employed population fell to 186,267 peo - ple, representing a 9.6% reduction from the previous year, or, in absolute terms, the elimination of 19,718 jobs, mainly in urban areas (68.8%). The unemployed population grew 20.8%, with the unemployment rate reaching 14.5%, with the increase in unem- ployment affecting men more (14.8% against 10.7% in 2019) than women (14.2% against 12.1% in 2019), and young workers in the 15- to 24-year-old age range (32.5%) more than older workers. The increase also hit those with educations of up to high-school level (19.1%) more than those with other levels of learning. 94It is worth highlighting that job vulnerability is related to the sector of activity and type of contract workers have, which can lead to a rapid increase in unemployment. Pre - carious contracts represented 22.4% of the economically active population (down 4.8 percentage points from 2019) and were con - centrated more in rural areas, among young (15-24) and elderly (64 and up) age groups and among males. Due to the specificities of these sectors, the effects of the pandemic were devastating, particularly for workers in the tourism sector. The inactivity rate went up in 18 of the country's 22 municipalities, and globally the inactive population grew 12.4% in 2020. The greatest concentration of inactivity was registered in rural areas (55%) and among young people between 15 and 24 (74.4%). Most of these youth are inactive because they are still in school or because they believe there are no jobs available (18.3%). The Special Micro and Small Businesses Tax Regime (REMPE) created by Law n\u00ba 70/ VIII/2014 applies to businesses incorporated and registered in Cabo Verdean territory, as well as to existing business units that are credentialled as micro or small businesses. As such, this tax regime encompasses busi - nesses that fulfill all necessary requirements and have opted not to have a highly orga - nized accounting structure. Micro businesses are considered those with a business volume of no more than 5 million escudos and/or which employ up to five workers. Small businesses are considered those will a business volume of between 5 and 10 million escudos and/or which employ between 6 and 10 workers. The regime encompasses a package of benefits such as the free registration of the corporation at the Casa do Cidad\u00e3o (a one-stop shop for citizens dealing with public administration issues), administrative simplification (in other words, incorpora - tion and commercial registration carried out at a single point of contact at the Casa do Cidad\u00e3o), the ability to begin business activities in the service sector with a mere prior communication, the carrying out of inspections by the competent public entities following the beginning of operations, with the exception of high-risk activities, the registration of sales, purchases and expen - ditures and exemption from the obligation to have an organized accounting structure, the substitution of Legal Person Income Tax, Value Added Tax, Fire Tax and Social Security contributions on the part of hiring entities with a Special Unified Tax of 4% on business volume, paid quarterly, a 30% reduction in taxes for the first two years for micro businesses incorporated after the REMPE entered into force, a 30% reduction in taxes for the first year and 20% in the second year for small businesses, the payment of a set 30,000 annual amount for micro businesses with business volumes of less than 1 million escudos, customs and VAT exemptions in the importing of a vehicle for the transportation of merchandise for exclusive use in busi - ness activities, exemption from stamp taxes 95 and legal fees and charges in incorporation, registration and capital injections, the alloca - tion of budgetary funds for micro and small business capacity building, the allocation of 25% of Public Acquisitions to micro and small businesses, the allocation of 10% of purchases on the part of large state companies, and the maximum payment period of 60 days for invoices issued to the State by micro and small businesses. One of the fundamental objectives of the REMPE is to expand the coverage base of mandatory social security through formaliza - tion. The existence of the REMPE encourages formalization. As such, the number of those covered by Social Security rose from 78,785 in 2015 to 103,192 in 2020, with those registered through REMPE increasing from 330 in 2015 to 15,781 in 2020. Of the 26,407 individuals newly covered by Social Security, 15,451 became so through the REMPE, making it account for the largest single portion (58.5%) of the recent growth in the number of those covered. This highlights the dynamic of formalization over the past 5 years. The national minimum wage was instituted in January 2014 through Law-Decree n\u00ba 6/2014, setting the minimum wage at CVE 11,000 (equivalent to US$ 113.60) per month, and applies to all non-self-employed workers subject to the Labor Code regime, including those employed by public entities, mixed capital corporations and public enterprises. The minimum wage is updated whenever public sector wages are increased or when the Social Coordination Council deliberates an increase thereof. However, the burden of informality on the national economy erodes the effectiveness of the measure. Unemployment subsidies were instituted in 2015 through Law-Decree 15/2015, with the management of unemployment payments ensured by the National Social Security Insti- tute (INPS), with the Employment and Pro - fessional Training Institute (IEFP) responsible for the management of active employment measures. Unemployment subsidies are financed through a 0.5% increase in INPS contribution fees by workers, with employers seeing a 1.5% increase in their copayments. Meanwhile, the national job market situation reflects the positive results of social dia - logue and collective commitments between the Executive, the Central Bank, businesses, workers, commercial banks, labor unions, civil society representatives, the private sector and NGOs, in terms of the points of collective consensus that helped soften the effects of the pandemic and slow down the reduction in disposable income and the imminent increase in unemployment through the implementation of a simpli - fied layoff regime and the concession of tax benefits and unemployment payments, among other things. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the idea that the process of the growth and development of Cabo Verde's economy must be anchored in dynamic sectors able to guarantee the sustainability and resiliency of economic growth. For this to be the case, a clear policy for the diversification of the economy is indispensable, with a strong investment in sectors with comparative and competitive advantages, mainly in the West African sub-region. 96 On a legislative and institutional level, Cabo Verde has long been committed to the fight against all forms of discrimination in the workplace, through the ratification of the ILO conventions in this area (fundamen - tal conventions 100 and 111). In order to protect workers' rights, particularly against the rescission of work contracts, the Cabo Verdean Labor Code stipulates all the nec - essary provisions. Despite this law, in prac - tice the percentage of unprotected workers remains significant, given the informality of employment in both the informal and formal sectors. The right to social security is laid out in the Constitution of the Republic of Cabo Verde, and labor rights are also included in the country's Labor Code and are consistent with ILO Convention 102 on the issue. Cabo Verde's successive governments have included the phenomenon of child labor in their programs and consider it a phenom - enon that must be eradicated. As proof of the appropriation of these aspects, Cabo Verde ratified the two fundamental ILO con - ventions on child labor, namely Convention 138 from 1973 on Minimum Age of Admission to Employment and Convention 182 from 1999 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. In this realm, the Constitution of the Republic of Cabo Verde and the Labor Code also guarantee the defense of these fundamental rights of children. Cabo Verdean authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to decent work and economic growth within the scope of the Cabo Verde Strategic Sustainable Develop - ment Agenda, which calls for the recovery, stabilization and acceleration of economic growth, promoting the diversification of the Cabo Verdean economy and achieving economic growth no lower than 5% a year between 2021 and 2025 and no lower than 7% a year between 2026 and 2030, as well as carrying out the decent work agenda, reaching full employment and reducing the unemployment rate to levels of no more than 5% (4.9% for men and 5.9% for women). Cabo Verdean authorities have, as a part of the same agenda, also reaffirmed their commitment to reducing the youth unem -ployment rate to levels of no more than 11.9% in 2030, but especially to investing heavily in the fight against exclusion among youth, reducing the proportion of NEET youth to a maximum level of 5%. The evolution of the economy over the past 5 years, the ongoing health, economic and social emergency program and especially the 2021-2022 Cabo Verdean Economy Recovery and Social Development Response Plan will ensure a return to the new normal in the labor market and the acceleration of the decent work agenda, with the promotion of formal employment, namely by accelerating the transition from the informal to the for - mal economy and expanding social security coverage to reach levels of no less than 80% in 2030, in addition to moving forward with regional integration and carrying out reforms in order to improve the business environ - ment and business development. In order to fulfill this objective, Cabo Verdean authorities are investing essentially in the accelerators of sustainable development - in other words., the development of human capital, the tran - sition to the blue economy, the acceleration of the energy transition, the development of the digital economy and the increase in the aggregate value of the tourism industry in the real economy, within a context of security, strong institutions and systems, internal and international connectivity, the reinforcement of the financing of sustainable development and partnerships. 97 SDG 9. INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE98SDG 9. INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE Investments in roads have an important impact on reducing poverty and improving the population's quality of life. National (1,113 km) and municipal (600 km) roads add up to a total of 1,713 km of roadways in the country. More than 110 km of roads underwent rehabilitation and modernization in the last 5 years to improve accessibility between towns and roads with high agricul - tural and tourist potential. 91% of national roads benefit from ongoing maintenance, on all inhabited islands, and in more than 30 locations across the country. The COVID- 19 pandemic also had impacts on the infrastructure sector, resulting in a lack of production, increased costs and unforeseen expenses, causing delays and cancellations. As an island state, maritime transport is essential to connectivity, which represents challenge in unifying the islands, business opportunities for farmers and industrialists, easier access to health services, profes - sional and higher training, domestic tourism and the reduction of regional asymmetries. Between 2015 and 2019, air passenger trans - port saw average annual growth of 8%, and cargo transport of 16.4%. Maritime passenger transport had an average annual growth of 6.2% and cargo transport 8%. In 2020, air passenger transport decreased by 71.4%, 99 air cargo transport by 43.3%, passenger sea transport by 31.7% and cargo shipping by 36.9%. The volume of passengers traveling by land decreased by 31.6% in 2020, after an average annual growth of 13.6% between 2015 and 2019. Cabo Verde is a service economy par excellence, and, as such, the weight of the manufacturing industry is not very expres - sive. In 2020, it represented about 7.3% of GDP, showing an increase in its weight, as in 2016 the same figure stood at only 5.9%. In 2020, the manufacturing industry pro - vided only 8.8% of total jobs, representing a decrease of 0.9 percentage points in com- parison to 2015, and with a per capita GVA of about 239 US$ (-US$ 20 as compared to 2019). Employment in industry has declined by an average of 2.7% since 2015. In 2020, expenditure on research and development in Cabo Verde reached approximately 0.15% of GDP, a level slightly below that of 2017 (0.17% of GDP), but which represents strong growth over the last 5 years. According to the Multisectoral Economic Regulatory Agency (ARME), in 2020, the population covered by GSM and 3G ser - vices increased from 98.8% and 86.8%, respectively, in 2015, to 99.34% and 94.7%. In 2019, 79.4% of the population had 4G coverage. Home internet access also grew considerably, from 48.8% in 2016 to 67% in 2019, with significant differences among place of residence, from 51.2% to 73.6% in urban areas and from 43,5% to 51.6% in rural areas. In 2020, digital connectivity increased with the pandemic, with online work and classes accelerating the achievement of one of the Government's priorities.100 Cabo Verdean authorities have reinforced their commitment to resilient infrastructure, inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation. They are committed to developing quality, reliable, sustainable and robust infrastruc- tures and shall prioritize public hearings and discussion on all public works, but will prioritize, whenever possible, the modality of public-private partnership for the financing of large projects and for the promotion of the domestic civil construction sector, due to the impact it has on employment, as well as on competitiveness and internationalization. They are committed to creating the condi - tions necessary to make the country one of the hubs of Africa, taking advantage of the insufficiency of connections in Africa and in the field of Maritime Transport. They will transform the island of S\u00e3o Vicente into a Maritime Economic Zone based on the vision that, like the in the air sector, it is possi - ble to transform Cabo Verde into a useful country, taking advantage of the business potential of providing services due to the country's location halfway between the two hemispheres, and through whose waters hundreds of ships travel daily. With regards to Land Transport, authorities will create the conditions to improve the quality and safety of vehicles in all the country's islands. Cabo Verdean authorities have renewed their focus on industry, taking advantage of the advantages afforded by AGOA and SGPS+, but, above all, ECOWAS and the African Continental Free Trade Area. They intend to develop a competitive and innovative industrial sector, significantly contributing to sustainable and inclusive development, integrated into regional and global value chains. Cabo Verdean authorities recognize that it is a priority to strengthen scientific research and improve technological capacities, par- ticularly in industrial sectors. Thus, Cabo Verdean authorities will provide the country with a scientific and technological research policy that builds a knowledge-based society, with standards of quality and efficiency of global reference, based on the exchange between cultural and scientific capacities at national and international scales and taking advantage of comparative advantages and promoting innovation and integrated and transversal scientific development. As such, they are committed to investing in research and development, which is expected to reach nearly 2% of GDP in 2030. Cabo Verdean authorities prioritize the development of the digital economy, as an export sector of services and make the digi\u00actal an accelerator for the modernization of central public administration, at the ser - vice of citizens and companies, promoting trans\u00acparency in public management, the improve\u00acment of the business environment and above all the improvement of efficiency and pro\u00acductivity in companies and an accel - erator for the approximation of the diaspora and the reinforcement of its participation, as well as for internal connectivity. The Cabo Verdean authorities aspire to make Cabo Verde a transformed and digitized economy, a regional telecommunications hub, a regional center of innovation, entre - preneurship and excellence and a regional reference market for the digital economy. 101 SDG 10. REDUCING INEQUALITIES 102SDG 10. REDUCING INEQUALITIES Despite our successful progress over the course of these 46 years as an independent nation and the success of the first wave of decentralization in the form of municipalism, Cabo Verde remains a country of deep- rooted inequalities and regional asymmetries aggravated by territorial discontinuity. Aware of this reality, Cabo Verdean authorities have, since 2016, focused on the reduction of inequalities through inclusive economic growth and social policies combating exclu - sion and reducing asymmetries in opportu - nities, as well as through decentralization, the reinforcement of local government, the dynamization of local economies, positive discrimination and regional development. In 2020, the amount of average yearly expenditure per capita of the 40% with lower income was 754 UDS, higher in urban areas (785 USD) than in rural areas (748 USD). This means a decrease by 5,7% compared to previous year, higher in urban areas (8%) than in rural areas (3,5%). These expenditures increased by 3,2% in the last 5 years, being 2,4% in urban areas and 3,9% in rural areas, which suggests a reduction of inequalities. In Cabo Verde, some 5.2% of the popu - lation lives with consumer expenditures of less than 50% of median expenditures (5.1% for males and 5.2% for females). This level of consumer spending reaches its maximum among children 0-4 years in age (10.4%), followed by those 10-14 years in age (9.2%) and 5-9 years in age (8.1%), reaching a minimum level of 2.3% among those 65 years of age and over. As Chart 2 above illustrates, the proportion of the population with consumer expendi- tures below 50% of median expenditures has dropped 9.8 percentage points since 2015, with the reduction more expressive among women (10.1 pp) than among men (9.5 pp), and more accentuated among those 5-9 years of age (11.8 pp), followed by those 15-24 years of age (10.3 pp) and those 10-14 years of age (9.9 pp), reaching a minimum of 9.1 pp among persons 65 and over. This trend also suggests a reduction in inequality.Using the international poverty line, according to estimates from the National Statistics Institute (INE), in 2020 there were 72,874 poor persons (in other words, persons living on less than US$ 1.90 a day) in Cabo Verde, equivalent to 13.1% of the population. Abso- lute poverty is more acute in rural areas, where 24.3% of the population is poor, while in urban areas the figure stands at 8.1%.. Using the national poverty line, according to the same source, in 2020 there were 175,844 poor persons (in other words, persons living on less than US$ 2.77 a day) in Cabo Verde, equivalent to 31.6% of the population. Abso - lute poverty was more acute in rural areas, 103 where 44.9% of the population is poor, a figure that stands at 25.8% in urban areas. The National Human Rights and Citizenship Commission (CNDHC) had no reports over the past 12 months of populations claiming they felt discriminated against or under attack for reasons prohibited with the scope of international human rights legislation. The most recent available data on remunerations including social security contributions hails from 2017. In that year, the category represented approximately 37.2% of GDP, slightly higher than in 2015 (35.8%) - in other words, the amount grew some 2.3% a year between 2015 and 2017. However, according to the national accounts published by the INE, final consumption expenditures represented 63.5% of GDP, with the figure standing at 51.6% in the last pre-pandemic crisis year and 65.2% in 2015. Average yearly growth was 1.2% between 2015 and 2020, with the low level of growth coming due to the major decrease in 2020 (8.6%), given that between 2015 and 2019 this aggregate grew at an average of 3.8% a year. As a result of Cabo Verde's graduation to the status of middle-income country in 2007, Official Development Assistance has gradually decreased, oscillating between 10.5% of GDP in 2015 to 9.4% in 2019, albeit growing to 12% of GDP in 2020. This growth is the result of international solidarity and postponement of disbursement payments as a way of better confronting the negative effects of the pandemic. Remittances from \u00e9migr\u00e9s continue to be one of the pillars of exchange sustainability, reaching approxi - mately 12.6% of GDP in 2020 - indeed, with nearly the same weight as public develop - ment assistance. Remittances from \u00e9migr\u00e9s showed average growth of 3.8% between 2016 and 2020, considerably below the projections formulated in the elaboration of the PEDS and below what was observed prior to 2016. The reduction in absolute poverty by some 10.6 percentage points is due in part to the economic growth that averaged some 4.7% a year from 2016 to 2019, with the next generation of just 11,900 jobs (26,000 jobs in the non-agricultural sector) and 0.8% over the last 5 years, reducing the volume of employment to levels below 2015 and increasing the proportion of NEET youth 15-35 years old to 35.4%, above the 32.5% seen in 2015. The reduction in inequality is intimately linked to public transfer payments, which went from some US$ 58.8 million in 2015 to US$ 97 million in 2020.The volume of public expenditures with social inclusion programs - in other words, \"Guaranteed Access to income, education, care and health,\" which includes Inclusive Social Income and Social Pensions, and \"Guarantee of children's and teenagers' rights and protection\" - accounted for some 14.4% of public expenditures and 5.1% of GDP, averaging 12.4% and 4.1% of public expenditures and GDP over the past 3 years. The massification of professional training and professional internships, the increase in study grants, exemption from elementary and high school tuition, the expansion of social security coverage and, especially, the increase in the amount of resources trans - ferred to municipalities and the Requali - fication, Rehabilitation and Accessibilities Program, with a large portfolio of works proposed by municipalities, helped reduce asymmetries in terms of opportunities and provided an important boost to the improvement of the distribution of national wealth and, as a result, to the reduction of inequality. 104 With the 2030 Cabo Verde Strategic Sustain - able Development Agenda, Cabo Verdean authorities have committed to guaranteeing the vaccination of all Cabo Verdeans by 2022 and developing human capital, ensuring all are afforded access to health care adequate to their respective life cycle, excellent education, access to culture and sports and, particularly for young people, access to professional training and higher education in order to take proper advantage of opportunities and ensure a productive population. The country's authorities have reinforced their commitment to ensuring that everyone has the possibility to live in dignified housing and is protected against any type of exploitation or child labor and, fundamentally, guaranteeing family policies that encourage the creation and stability of families. They have recen - tered the commitment to ensure a healthy environment for all, with proper sanitation, low risks of environmental disasters and an absence of threats to citizens' physical integrity and property. They are also committed to diversifying the economy, promoting islands' economies, promoting regional development to ensure inclusive economic growth of no less than 5% a year between 2015 and 2025 and no less than 7% a year between 2026 and 2030, fulfilling the decent work agenda with full employment, reducing the proportion of NEET to a minimum, reducing gender-based inequality in terms of access, guaranteeing universal welfare coverage and thus rein - forcing social policies, reducing regional asymmetries and thus promoting the gradual and sustained reduction in inequality, and the convergence of all municipalities and islands around the SDGs so as to leave no one behind - in other words, to build shared prosperity. 105 SDG 11. SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES106SDG 11. SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES In 2019, Cabo Verdean authorities drew up a new profile of the housing sector in Cabo Verde, according to which the housing deficit stands at approximately 8.7%, while a new housing policy has been adopted and the national housing plan is in the comple - tion stage. In the domain of territorial planning, Cabo Verde currently has a Basic Law for Spatial Planning and Urban Planning and a National Regulation for Spatial Planning and Urban Planning that decentralizes and places in the respective municipalities the competences for the preparation of their detailed plans. The National Policy for Spatial Planning was drawn up and, in the field of Land Registry, the legal regime for the operation and pro- cessing of data of the Property Information, Management and Transaction System (SIGP) was approved. In 2019, only 0.8% of Cabo Verdeans lived in non-classical housing, that is, in shanties, informal settlements or inadequate housing, a proportion equal to 2015, more accentu - ated in urban areas (1.2%) than in rural areas (0.1%), and the vast majority (85.7%) lived in single-family houses. Cabo Verde is served by a good network of national and municipal roads, but also by a rental car park in good condition, meaning that the majority of the population has safe and easy access to transport. Most cities are small and, as such, internal mobility does not depend on the availability of public transport, which, in any case, is of high quality, reliability, safety and comfort in the two largest cities, namely Praia and Mindelo. Interurban transport is served by minibuses and, to a lesser extent, by mixed type vehicles, especially to areas not served by proper or paved roads. However, no Cabo Verdean city has mobility systems adapted for people with disabilities, and architectural barriers seriously limit accessibility. In 2020, 13,794,316 passengers were transported by bus. In the past 5 years, the Government of Cabo Verde invested CVE 179,405,615 in the reha -bilitation of 15 buildings classified by the Cultural Heritage Institute, an entity of the Ministry of Culture and Creative Industries, within the framework of the Requalification, Rehabilitation and Accessibility Program (PRRA), which is the largest investment ever made in the requalification of cultural heritage sites. According to the National Solid Waste Management Strategic Plan (PENGER), in Cabo Verde, the quantities of hazardous waste deposited in urban waste collection systems represent about 0.5% of total urban waste collected and sent to its final desti- nation, the equivalent of 729.47 metric tons/ year. The Plan calls for: a 50% reduction, 107 by 2030 in the amount of hazardous waste deposited; reducing the danger of solid haz - ardous waste, structuring specific hazardous waste flows, namely hospital waste, used oil, batteries and accumulators, through entities managing these flows; identifying disposal sites containing asbestos waste and ensuring the eradication of waste con - taining asbestos; promoting the balanced evolution of the amount of waste produced per inhabitant - in other words, reducing the value of capitation per GDP by 10% by 2030, as well as adopting plastic waste strategies in Cabo Verde in order to reduce the fraction of fine plastics admitted to the management systems by 80% by 2030, while the law on the prohibition of importing and using non-biodegradable plastic bags is already in force; the recovery of solid waste and, in particular, with the selective collection in at least 60% of municipalities by 2030, an increase by 2025 in 50% of waste sent for recovery and the creation of 8 units for the recovery of organic waste by 2030; and recycling/recovering 60% of waste in paper, glass, plastic and metal by 2030. The fulfillment of this plan presupposes the recovery and recycling of construction and demolition waste and, to achieve that, sending 50% of inert waste to be reused in new constructions or the recovery of extraction areas and 20% of construction and demolition waste to be recycled by 2030. In Cabo Verde, crimes against persons have been decreasing, according to data from the National Police, going from 13,298 occur - rences in 2015 to 7007 in 2020. Likewise, crimes of the sexual abuse of minors have gone down as well, from 104 occurrences in 2015 to 93 in 2020, and crimes of sexual assault follow the same trend, decreasing from 104 to 63 in the aforementioned period. Around 67.3% of the population lives in the 24 cities of Cabo Verde, all of which have urban plans. As such, urban management is an important function. Municipal Master Plans as well as lower-level plans are pre - pared with a participatory approach and submitted to public consultation. However, few cities have organizations such as City Advisory Councils or other mechanisms for the permanent consultation of city dwellers on urban phenomena and on city manage-ment in general, especially with regards to the domestic management of solid waste and noise or other types of pollution. As part of its capacity building project, and using the 2015-2030 Sendai Action Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction as a strategic guide for action, the Government of Cabo Verde, through its intergovernmental working group (created through Resolution No. 4/2017 of the Council of Ministers), pro - ceeded with the formulation of the National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy (ENRRD) and a National Post-Disaster Recovery Framework (QRD), in addition to a pilot study of Detailed Urban Risk Assessment 108(DURA), implemented in three municipali - ties (Praia, Mosteiros and Ribeira Brava). A National Disaster Observatory (OND) was also developed. All of these are essential tools for managing disaster risk and pro - moting resilience in Cabo Verde. These strategic and monitoring instruments are operationalized by the Strategic Sustain - able Development Plan (PEDS), through the \"Environmental, Geological and Climatic Risk Management\" program and, alternatively, through the \"Biodiversity Conservation and Environmental Quality\" program. These programs contribute to the creation of pre - cautionary mechanisms against the effects of global warming, such as the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and to the creation of conditions for the pro - duction and dissemination of information to prevent the effects of natural catastrophes, particularly climate effects. Some spatial planning instruments developed during this period, such as the Land Use Plan for the Maritime Coastline of the Island of Boa Vista, the Detailed Plan for Eito, and the Tourist Plan for Ba\u00eda and S\u00e3o Pedro, in S\u00e3o Vicente, among others, addressed the risks of disasters. In the last 5 years, communication and dissemination were reinforced with the presentation of the Strategy in most schools and in several communities in Cabo Verde. The emergency response plan was pre - pared with the support of the World Bank, as was a project to strengthen emergency response capacities. A legislative package is in the process of approval and socialization, and, with the support of UNESCO, an Early Warning system for floods and drought is being prepared, a system aimed at creat - ing resilience to respond to the impacts associated with risks and natural disasters. Cabo Verdean authorities expect to strengthen institutional conditions for the implementation of the Risk and Disaster Reduction Strategy with the institutionaliza - tion of a special office for strategy execution, associated with a financing line and the creation of crisis offices, operating on each island, and not just in times of crisis. 109 The Municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans (PEMDS) of some municipalities integrate the disaster risk approach, and Cabo Verdean authorities prioritize training for all municipalities for the integration of disaster risk reduction strategies in their Municipal Strategic Sus - tainable Development Plans. The volume of financial support in terms of foreign aid for social housing amounts to CVE 517,862,400, an insignificant volume considering the housing needs of the poor, especially in terms of requalification of degraded housing. The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on the housing sector, with increased consumption of water and electricity and increased production of urban solid waste. In addition to interventions under the Reha - bilitation and Accessibility Requalification Program, the Government prioritized, within the scope of additional measures aimed at poor families, the refurbishment of the derelict housing of 1,500 poor households, selected under the Single Social Registry. With regard to the road network, construction and requalification works were rescheduled, with postponements and cancellations, due to a reduction in appropriations under the Amended Budget, which prioritized the eco - nomic and social health emergency. In the field of conservation and preservation of historic heritage, several historic heritage rehabilitation projects were also postponed and canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Due to restrictions in movement, interruptions in the solid waste management service can temporarily impair waste management sys- tems, leading to an increased risk of improper disposal of hazardous waste. Combined with the lack of access to water in some house - holds, this situation could undermine hygiene practices, leading to adverse consequences for sanitation and hygiene standards and posing health risks. New challenges will arise due to the increased use of sanitary equipment such as masks, gloves, disinfecting gels, plastic containers, medical devices, electrical and electronic equipment, testing chemicals, etc. The prevalence of these forms of waste poses risks to the environment, particularly due to Cabo Verde's location in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which could exacerbate ocean contamination with microplastics entering the ocean food chain with negative impacts on the health of aquatic species and humans. Additional wastewater produced by improved hygiene practices also ends up in groundwater and the sea. The massive use of detergents, disinfectants and antimicrobial solutions can also have consequences for the environment. According to the Judiciary Police report, during the period of the State of Emergency, which basically corresponded to the second quarter of the year, there was a 41% reduc - tion in criminal occurrences registered by the Judiciary Police, in comparison with occurrences registered in the first quarter of 2020. Of note is the increase in property crimes (robbery and theft), GBV and cyber - crime (related to computer, debit card, and honor crimes committed using computers).Cabo Verdean authorities have reinforced their commitment to the development of sustain- able cities and communities in this way: In the housing sector, the Government of Cabo Verde will promote partnerships between the State and municipalities for the preparation and implementation of detailed urban plans, the urbanization of new housing areas and the development of social housing for poor families, within the framework of the New Housing Policy, the National Housing Plan and Municipal Housing Plans. Cabo Verde will, in relation to Spatial Plan - ning, take on the responsibility to carry out organization and planning in mutual respect for the autonomy of the state and munici - pal bodies, to foster collaboration between them in the adoption of a national territorial management system, with a view to ensuring an orderly territory at the heart of decisions, in which all actors who intervene directly or indirectly in the transformation thereof know their potential, risks and weaknesses and commit to the implementation of defined policies and practices, and to safeguard and conserve endogenous resources, ensuring Cabo Verde's harmonious and sustainable development and the wellbeing of its people. Regarding the road network, the government will continue with the road infrastructure development program, ensuring that 95% of national roads are covered by ongoing maintenance programs and more than 50% of national roads are in a very good or good state of repair.110With regards to the Conservation and Preservation of Natural and Historical Heritage, the Government of Cabo Verde will pay greater attention to material and intan- gible heritage, in particular to consolidate, implement and promote the program for the Promotion of the Morna, declared Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO; consolidate and relaunch the Cidade Velha World Heritage Site brand; consolidate the national intangible heritage and folklore enhancement program; submit the appli - cation for the Tarrafal Concentration Camp as a World Heritage Site; and consolidate our national policy for the preservation and enhancement of the Cabo Verdean language and continue with the program for the rehabilitation of the country's historical and religious heritage. Regarding Hazardous Solid Residues, Cabo Verdean authorities are committed to reducing the amount of deposited hazardous waste by 50% by 2030; reducing the degree of hazardousness of solid hazardous waste; promoting a balanced progression of the amount of waste produced per inhabitant - in other words, reducing the value of capitation per GDP by 10% by 2030, as well as adopting plastic waste reduction strate - gies in Cabo Verde, with the aim of reducing the fraction of fine plastics admitted to management systems by 80% by 2030, with the law on prohibiting the importation and use of non-biodegradable plastic bags already in force; recovering solid waste and, in particular, with selective collection in at least 60% of municipalities by 2030, increasing waste sent for recovery by 50% by 20205; creating 8 units for the recovery of organic waste by 2030; and recycling/ recovering 60% of waste in paper, glass, plastic and metal by 2030. In terms of urban development and management of cities, Cabo Verdean authorities will create conditions so that, based on plans for the development of urban systems, plans are drawn up for the infrastructure of new urban centers and for the urban rehabilitation and requalification of all of Cabo Verde's towns and cities, to be implemented under the infrastructure program. Municipal authorities will, under the terms of the law, promote mechanisms for permanent consultation on the part of city dwellers on urban phenomena and on the management of the city in general - that is, on the knowledge, feeling, thinking and pulse of the city - and, in this way, foster participatory management.Cabo Verde will also promote conditions to strengthen the capacities of municipalities, to ensure the sustainable management of cities, with special attention to the prepa - ration and implementation of safeguards and urban plans for historic centers and sites, as well as to the creation of conditions and capacity building of municipalities for the inspection and monitoring of planning instruments. Cabo Verde undertakes to adopt resilience and risk and disaster management plans at the municipal level, with mapping of climate risks in all 22 municipalities, preparation of disaster recovery plans for all municipali- ties, with resource inventories, measures and actions of first response (including on logistics) relating to post-disaster humani - tarian needs, and increasing municipalities' resilience through monitoring. 111 SDG 12. SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION 112SDG 12. SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION As a Small Middle-Income Island State, Cabo Verde faces endogenous structural challenges that threaten the construction of an economy with a high level of sustainable and inclusive growth. Cabo Verde Ambition 2030 outlined strategies in terms of sustainable, integrated produc - tion and consumption to be made operational through the 2022-2026 Strategic Sustainable Development Plan and will be appropri - ated by sectorial and municipal plans. We acknowledge, however, the need for the adoption of a Sustainable Production and Consumption Action Plan that encompasses short-, medium- and long-term measures in order to overcome deficiencies, affirm the country's comparative and competitive advantages and give due value to economic opportunities. According to the 2nd Cabo Verde NDC 2020, the country in recent years has embarked on an ambitious transition to a zero-carbon economy. An important landmark in this process was the adoption, in 2019, of the 2018-2040 Electricity Sector Master Plan, which is centered on the country's transition to a decarbonized economy. New challenges and insufficiencies on the level of food control led to the reassess - ment of the effectiveness and efficiency of food control systems on a national level. Law-Decree n\u00ba 03/2009 thus instituted the National Food Control System (SNCA) and the Integrated Food Rapid Alert System (SIARA) which, as support mechanisms for the detection of situations of non-compli- ance inherent to food products, will help reduce the risks associated with the human and animal consumption of food products, both those produced in the country and imported. Since 2006 Cabo Verde has been a party to the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade. According to the National Solid Waste Prevention and Management Strategic Plan (PENGER), in Cabo Verde the production of dangerous waste is not very significant, representing just 0.5% of all waste, the equivalent of 853 metric tons per year or 1.53 kg per capita. However, at least in health sector facilities, there are protocols for the han - dling of this type of waste. According to Cabo Verde's Commercial Code, it is not mandatory for businesses to publish sustainability reports. Businesses normally do not publish a specific report on sustain - ability, but many are sensitive to sustain - ability issues. Some of Cabo Verde's largest companies in the area of fuel, the pharma - ceutical industry and paint have made a commitment to sustainability, promoting ongoing training for their staff in health, the environment, quality, innovation and sustainability. They develop social programs in line with the SDGs, promoting positive behaviors. They invest in the development of innovative and sustainable technology that allows clients to contribute toward a cleaner environment and work continually on the reduction of the negative environmental 113 impacts of their operations, guaranteeing the existence of healthy ecosystems. Fac - tory and laboratory installations ensure irreprehensible quality control of products, the formulations of which respect the most demanding European standards in terms of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and environmentally harmful additives. In Cabo Verde, sustainable public acqui - sitions are a practice, albeit one that continues to be perfected. The Public Con - tracting Act, approved by Law n\u00ba 88/VIII/ 2015, stipulates that in contract formation procedures, the public and private entities involved must give priority to ecological acquisitions, works, solutions and actions, with the understanding that these con-tribute significantly to the reduction of negative environmental impacts. The Public Contracting Act (CCP), which regulates con - tract formation, and the Administrative Contract Legal Regime, which regulates the execution of contracts, both promote sustainable public acquisitions through the principles of public contracting, norms and procedures. In Cabo Verde, education for citizenship is a part of school curricula. These curricula do not yet, however, specifically include education for sustainable development, but the Strategic Education Plan ensures alignment with the SDGs and, indeed, the Ministry of Education base law guarantees the mainstreaming of the SDGs, meaning that, effectively speaking, sustainable development permeates the edu - cational system. In 2019, the Cabo Verdean Government adopted the Main Priorities of the Stra - tegic Sustainable Tourism Development Plan, which is organized into five pillars: a socio-economic pillar, an environmental pillar, a cultural and peace pillar, a security pillar and a respect for all people pillar. It also elaborated Tourism Master Plans for all of the islands as instruments for the promotion of sustainable tourism that gives due value to natural and human resources and contributes to the wellbeing of Cabo Verdeans in all of the country's islands and municipalities while promoting positive experiences for visitors. 114 Cabo Verde stopped subsidizing fossil fuels in 2009. Currently, the fossil fuel prices practiced on the domestic market are regulated by a maximum price regime that is updated monthly through an automatic mechanism that indexes prices to fluctuations in international prices. Cabo Verdean authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to promoting sustainable production and consumption and, similarly, to sustainable tourism that values the country's natural and human resources, contributes to the wellbeing of Cabo Verdeans in all of the country's islands and municipalities for the benefit of present and future generations, and provides and promotes positive experiences for visitors. Along these lines, Cabo Verde's authorities have made a commitment to promoting practices of sustainability in businesses and perfecting sustainable public acquisitions. They have also made a commitment to investing in structural projects in the realm of urban solid waste management, such as the construction of controlled landfills, the conversion of controlled landfills into sanitary landfills, the closing of dumps and the construction of service centers at sanitary landfills, in fulfillment of the National Solid Waste Management Strategic Plan (PENGER).115 SDG 13. CLIMATE ACTION116SDG 13. CLIMATE ACTION Take urgent measures to combat climate change and its impacts Cabo Verdean authorities are aware of the current state of climate emergency in the world, and advocate a responsible and respectful attitude toward current and future generations. They are aware that climate change is a reality today and already has an undeniable impact; that Cabo Verde is highly exposed to the negative impacts of climate change, and that it will likely increase the fre - quency and severity of hydrometeorological risks (floods and droughts) and a possible increase in the sea level; and that Cabo Verde must prepare by creating resilience that allows it to deal with the phenomena associated with these changes. These last 5 years have been characterized by the Cabo Verdean authorities' strong commitment to climate resilience, having considerably strengthened national capacities for data production, monitoring of climatic phenomena and risks, as well as for their prevention and the provision of information to support measures to mitigate risks inherent to economic activi - ties, such as air, maritime, and agriculture transport, as well as to prevent any disasters. Cabo Verde ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and, as a party thereto, in 2017 presented its Third National Communication on Climate Change.The First, Second and Third National Com- munications to the UNFCCC were presented in 2000, 2010 and 2017. Through Resolution No. 16/2009, the Government created the Inter-ministerial Committee on Climate Change, which also functions as a National Authority, with the purpose of articulating actions resulting from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and its subsidiary bodies, to which Cabo Verde is party. In the country's 23 years as a signatory to the United Nations Framework Con - vention on Climate Change, Cabo Verdean authorities have been able to integrate mea - sures related to climate change in national education, energy and agriculture policies, strategies and planning. The Government Program for the 9th Legislature (2016 - 2021) and the 2017-2021 Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (PEDS) placed climate change at the center of domestic concerns, involving regional entities and specialized agencies of the United Nations. The National Climate Change Adaptation Plan is currently in the process of being drafted. According to Cabo Verde's 2017 Third National Communication on Climate Change, in 2010, total CO2 emissions reached 292.84 Gg, corresponding to a decrease of 1.54% in comparison to 2005. Total CH4 and N2O emissions increased by 26.76% (5.71 Gg) and (0.23 Gg), respectively. HFC-134a saw an increase of 225.45% in 2010, compared to 2005, having been estimated at 1.90 t HFC-134a. The Third National Communica - tion on Climate Change presents scenarios of progress and the Government, having benefited from funding from the GEF/UNDP and other development partners, prepared and implemented projects and programs, approved by the National Parliament, namely 117 Resolution n\u00ba 35/IX/2017, ratifying the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on October 21, 2017. Environmental education on climate change was institutionalized, human and institu - tional capacities on mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning mea - sures on climate change were strengthened, and the 2013-2022 National Plan for Envi- ronmental Education (PNEA) was approved. Environmental issues were integrated into the curricula of elementary, secondary and university education, including children, who are the main actors in the perpetuation of values, through syllabi that include basic notions related to environmental protection, natural resource management, waste treat - ment, body care, health, hygiene and safety - in other words, concepts that lead to understanding the environment, preserving the surrounding environment, and absorbing positive attitudes regarding environmental issues. As a Small Island Developing State, Cabo Verde has benefited from specialized sup- port to increase its capacity in planning and management related to climate change, as well as the capacity to adapt to its adverse impacts. Cabo Verde will invest in agroforestry and pastoral resilience, with interventions in reforestation and the restoration of environmental ecosystems, prioritizing the mobilization of water associated with decentralized renewable energy solutions. The government's goal is to reduce dependency on rainfall (through the massification of sea water desalination) and strengthen the circular water economy (through the re-generation of used water) for use mainly in agriculture, in order to combat climatic adversities and thus create resilient structures in the process of climate change. Cabo Verdean authorities have made a commitment, in this decade, to promote conditions that will allow the country to minimize the impacts of climate change through planned and concerted actions at all levels to ensure we are a safe small island state, with all the necessary favorable capacities to seize the opportunities provided by climate change and become more sustainable, innovative and resilient. 118 Cape Verdean authorities will promote: Public policies for improving Climate Governance, institutional arrangements and climate-sensitive planning, improving local resilience, fighting poverty and iden - tifying opportunities for adaptation and low-carbon development at the community level, to be included in Municipal planning; the strengthening of adaptation actions to address current and future vulnerabilities (V&A); the implementation of mitigation actions for the benefit of the country's development; understanding climate change and implementing concerted and planned responses to extreme weather events, based on scientific data; the expansion of Infor - mation, Education, Awareness and Training on climate change. The establishment of a new type of climate governance, including the creation of a Public Authority, to ensure planning, management and implementation of the Country's climate policy; The integration of climate change into poli - cies, plans and strategies at all levels (Sectoral and Spatial) in order to take into account the risks and opportunities of climate change in decision-making and implementation; An effective institutional coordination model between governance structures at multiple levels, as well as articulation with other sec - tors that may influence or have an impact on climate change resilience. Cabo Verde is committed to reducing emis - sions of CO2 and other Greenhouse Gases (GHG) across the economy by 20% below the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, with the reduction reaching 30% below the BAU scenario, with the long-term objective of achieving an economy with zero net decar - bonized emissions by 2050. To this end, it will focus on improving energy efficiency between sectors, i.e. electricity production, transforming transportation into a fully elec - trified mobility sector; improving resource management; and strengthening soil mitiga - tion measures. By 2030, Cabo Verde seeks to install core resilience and metrics functions, namely with regard to full, clean, accessible and gender-sensitive access to water, energy and transport, basic health conditions, and universal higher education. To this end, Cabo Verde will develop a new National Adapta- tion Plan as part of its global contribution to climate change, to be presented to the UNFCCC by 2023. To plan, manage and track progress, Cabo Verde will form a national climate governance system centered on inclu - sive consultation, institutional coherence and scientific excellence. 119 SDG 14. PROTECTING MARINE LIFE120SDG 14. PROTECTING MARINE LIFE The ocean represents 99% of our territory and is clearly our greatest treasure. This treasure represents an important source of food for the country's population, jobs for some 11,000 people (a figure that could reach 35,000 in 2030) and a significant source of revenues for many households, even though its direct contribution to the GDP is relatively low (below 1%). It is a stra - tegic resource for the development of Cabo Verde, and it is urgent that we promote a paradigm shift in relation to the \"sea\" so as to transform it into one of the main anchors of the development, diversification and spe - cialization of the Cabo Verdean economy in the coming decades. It is a strategic invest - ment to leverage Cabo Verde's development using the sea through a holistic, ambitious and sustainable approach, transforming it into one of the country's specificities and complementarities to promote greater integration in the ECOWAS and to take advantage of the opportunities that exist within the scope of the African Continental Free Trade Area and the middle Atlantic. Eutrophication of waters in Cab Verde is highly localized in a number of bays, but is not very expressive from the environmental point of view. In the case of the island of S\u00e3o Vicente, the phenomenon was very much visible in Mindelo Bay, but is today under control now that the sewage discharge that once existed in the zone has ceased, leading to a reduction in effluents rich in organic material. Our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) totals 740,000 Km\u00b2, and the effective management thereof is carried out through eco-systemic approaches. However, in Cabo Verde the classic system of the evaluation of marine resources still prevails, but gradually the country has begun adhering to the AEP to better manage scarce resources. It is also important to highlight the fact that Cabo Verdean authorities attribute due value to the country's natural blue capital, with environmental promotion and requalification an urgent matter, controlling the sources of pollution in coastal zones and the marine environment and organizing the coastline in such a way as to minimize its artificialization and pressure on coastal zones and pro - tected areas. In Cabo Verde, the average acidity of sea water is pH 8-8.3, which coincides with the general average of oceans, and Cabo Verdean authorities have not experienced or measured any acidic events in our Exclusive Economic Zone. All fishing activities are monitored from the point of view of fishing zones as well as from that of catches hauled in. Moni - toring is carried out via satellite emissions from the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). Management is not carried out by popula - tion units but rather by groups of species, which are considered single stocks for the entire Cabo Verdean territory. Given the country's location in a zone of low pri - mary productivity, it has modest fishing 121 resource potential, although it does have a large specific diversity that can allow it to create and manage wealth as a result of the quality of its resources in relation to the quantity, which is scarce. Fishing resources are managed within the limits of sustainability through monitoring carried out using biological points of reference. The weight of fishing on the GDP stood at 0.66% of 2020, representing a reduction of 0.52 percentage points in comparison to 2015. In Cabo Verde, this activity has become highly affected by overfishing and by the impact of climate change, given that fishing resources are not always able to adapt to these changes in the ocean, unleashing various negative effects, including the loss of traditional fisheries, the reduction in revenues and jobs, and major concerns with the food security of populations. In Cabo Verde, protected marine resources total 149,598.95 hectares (1,495.99 km2), the equivalent of 6.7% of the country's territorial waters, which means an increase in 1.04 percentage points in the total surface area of protected areas in comparison to 2015. By the end of 2021, we will have signed at least one co-management accord for the protected areas of the island of Sal. In order to combat illegal fishing, one of the main threats to the sustainable exploitation of marine resources, Cabo Verde is in harmony with that has been proposed and adopted by the international community through accords, cooperation and dialogue, and has joined the main international conventions and regional and international organizations in this realm, namely the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the FAO 2001 Interna - tional Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IUU Fishing), the Port State Measures Agreement to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, the accord for the promotion of the fulfillment of international conservation and manage - ment measures by fishing vessels on the high seas, the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC), the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) and the Fisheries Transparency Initiative. In 2020, public expenditures with investiga - tion in the realm of maritime technologies represented some 23.6% of overall public expenditures with investigation, which cor - responds to a 29.3 percentage point reduc - tion in relation to 2016. The Government of Cabo Verde is implementing the Campus do Mar (Ocean Campus), an initiative that is consistent with the ambition of turning Cabo Verde into a maritime nation. The Ocean Campus is structured along three pillars: higher education, research and technical-professional training. To this end, three entities have been created to make these pillars operational, respectively: the Technical University of the Atlantic (UTA), the Institute of the Sea (IMAR) and the School of the Sea (EMAR). Within the scope of the new ecosystem for the financing of the economy, Cabo Verdean authorities are promoting entrepreneurship in the area of the blue economy, namely with the \"Promotion of the Blue Economy\" Program (PROMEA), which is intended to support the process of the transition to the Blue Economy. The Policy Charter for the Blue Economy of December 21, 2020, which 122was ratified on February 5, 2021, is in total harmony with the sustainable development goals and reaffirms the country's commit - ment to the sustainable development of maritime and coastal zones, valuing under - water heritage, and promoting protected marine areas as a management tool, con - tributing toward minimizing environmental degradation, the loss of biodiversity and the non-sustainable use of marine resources and maximizing economic and social ben- efits for the population. Cabo Verde is party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, in addi - tion to the agreement for the promotion of compliance with the International Conser - vation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas, which have been absorbed by Cabo Verdean legislation in ocean-related public policies and plans. Cabo Verde has developed and approved the governing tools for the transition of the maritime economy to the blue economy - in other words, the Policy Charter for the Blue Economy, the Blue Economy Unified Strategic Framework, the National Plan for the Blue Economy and the Blue Economy Promotion Program. The Government of Cabo Verde is open to the possibility of Cabo Verde seeking new financing mechanisms for its Blue Economy Transition Process within the framework of the implementation of the above-referenced governing instruments. In addition to existing mechanisms, such as the Climate Fund, among others, Cabo Verde seeks to negotiate debt relief or even the reconversion of Public Debt into investment and implementation of its main instruments for the transition to the Blue Economy. The Policy Charter for the Blue Economy in Cabo Verde reinforces the country's commitment to the sustainable development of maritime and coastal areas, valuing underwater heritage and promoting protected marine areas as management tools, contributing toward minimizing environmental degradation, the loss of biodiversity and the non-sustainable use of marine resources and maximizing economic and social benefits for the population. Within this scope, Cabo Verdean authorities intend to reinforce the coherence and integration of public policies related to the maritime economy and coordination for an integrated approach with other sectors, namely transportation, industry, tourism, urban planning, ports, trade, the environment, fishing and aquaculture, the planning and management of coastal zones and maritime areas, ecotourism, renewable energies and energy efficiency, marine biodiversity and agriculture, among other new niches of social and human growth and development.123 Cabo Verdean authorities thus reaffirm their commitment to protecting marine life and affirming Cabo Verde as a maritime nation through the implementation of the strategy for the blue economy on the 2030 horizon, which is grounded in Cabo Verde's transfor - mation into an international maritime and logistics platform and a country globally inte - grated into the regional and world economy. An inclusive and sustainable blue economy will serve as an important accelerator of economic growth and a catalyst for greater economic resiliency, more employment and greater wellbeing for populations. Cabo Verdean authorities prioritize the implemen - tation of the Special Maritime Economic Zone in S\u00e3o Vicente (ZEEMSV) as the main pillar of the blue economy transition strategy, namely through the implementation of projects related to the development of ports, fishing and ship repair. The country's authorities prioritize the inte- grated and sustainable development of the sea economy integrating the development of ports, maritime transportation and logis -tics, fishing, maritime tourism and nautical sports, bunkering, international ship regis- tration and other maritime services, ship repair and construction, environmental and marine ecosystem protection, and coastal and marine territorial management. They will promote maritime education and research, taking advantage of all of the facets of the Ocean Campus, as well as a greater proximity between Cabo Verdeans and the sea and the development of maritime culture. 124 They will promote the development of fisheries, including aquaculture, fish pro - cessing and transshipment, in order to make them more modern, sustainable, formalized and secure, to be grounded in adequate and appropriate support infrastructures. They will promote the transition from traditional fishing methods to blue fishing through empowerment, organization, greater security, the promotion of associations, cor - poratization and the institution of a micro- credit system, as well as the rehabilitation and construction of unloading docks and ports and the introduction of new forms of and new technologies in fishing and com - mercialization. They will ensure the construction of the S\u00e3o Vicente Cruise Ship Terminal and the development of cruise ship tourism, exploiting the resources of all of the islands to position them as an important and attractive cruise ship destination in the region, as well as promote the development of recreational boating and nautical sports. They will invest in the planning of the coast - line and maritime belt, improved monitoring of Cabo Verde's Exclusive Economic Zone and the fight against sea pollution and illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing. They will promote the interconnection between the blue economy and other sec - tors, namely tourism, agriculture, energy, the digital economy, territorial management and others. They will also foster the exploration of innovative mechanisms for financing the blue economy, the promotion of blue diplomacy and active participation in regional and international organizations linked to the sea. 125 SDG 15. PROTECTING LAND LIFE126SDG 15. PROTECTING LAND LIFE There is a need and intention to protect, restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably managed forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation and halt the loss of biodiversity. According to data from the 2013 national forest inventory, the area with woody vegetation cover is 89,903 ha, with about 50 species and 1 sub-species, representing 23% of the national territory. About 14.9% are agroforestry zones and 12.5% are open forest zones. Santiago (50,532 ha), Fogo (9,929 ha) and Maio (7177 ha) are the most wooded islands. In Cabo Verde, protected areas cover an area of 164,046.34 ha, with 61,695.40 ha of land, which represents 18.19% of the coun- try's surface area. Protected areas in forest perimeters total 34,472 ha, equivalent to 344.72 km2 (8.5% of the national territory), and cover the islands of S. Ant\u00e3o (19,767.5 ha), Santiago (3,647.3 ha), S. Nicolau (2,277 ha), S. Vicente (311.9 ha) and Fogo (8,468.5 ha). There are several milestones for actions in the conservation of biodiversity and conservation of the environment, high - lighting 4 essential milestones: in 2018, the island of Santa Luzia was awarded an international prize by the International Small Ialnds Organization (SMILO) in the category of sustainability, for landscape and biodiversity management; in 2019, the Cova/Paul/Ribeira da Torre Natural Park, in Santo Ant\u00e3o, received the Melina Mercouri international prize, awarded by UNESCO, for its cultural and natural value and the interrelationships between the elements of the natural environment and the inge - nuity of man in this protected area. Also in 2019, the Cabo Verde Botanical Garden, created and managed by National Agrarian Research and Development Institute INIDA, was distinguished with the international award \"Terras Sem Sombra\" in the category of Biodiversity Safeguarding, and in 2020, the islands of Maio and Fogo were classified as UNESCO World Biosphere Reserves. The Fogo Biosphere Reserve has a total area of 102,142.03 ha, with 47,074.195 ha (470 km2) located on dry land. In practical terms, it covers the entire island and an extensive marine area surrounding it. The Reserve's 127 Core Zone, with a land area of 6,940.89 ha, includes the Integral Protection Zones and the Moderate Use Zones of the Fogo Natural Park. This zone corresponds to the highest altitudes of the island of Fogo and Cabo Verde, with the highest point being 2,829 m, at the peak of the Fogo volcano. The Fogo volcano and its adventitious cones, the lava flows from the different volcanic eruptions, the interior and exterior borders and Monte Velha forest, represent areas of great geological and biological value, housing lavas, cones, caves, and plant and animal species endemic to the island and Cabo Verde, corresponding to high-value ecosystems. The Maio Biosphere Reserve has a total area of 73,972.43 ha, with 26,900.00 ha (269 km2) located on dry land. The Core Zone corresponds to areas with a minimal degree of disturbance, with main natural or semi-natural habitats or ones altered very little by human intervention. Around the core (buffer zone) are zones of natural or semi-natural habitats, with important species of flora and fauna that need to be preserved and used sustainably. The surrounding area covers the rest of the island's territory, also considered an integral part of the reserve, arising from the commitment to the use of socioeconomic development models that incorporate the conservation and sustainable use of the island's natural resources, biodiversity and water resources. Progress in sustainable forest management is evident, highlighting the success achieved with the national forestation program, which has been taking place since the country's 128independence. According to data from the forest inventory, the area with woody vegetation cover increased from 82 thousand hectares in 2004 to 89,903 hectares in 2013, or more than 7000 hectares, representing 23% of the national territory. According to the same source, Cabo Verde had an area of 43,700 acres in forests and about 47,000 acres with different types of wooded areas. Some protected areas, such as Serra da Malagueta, Monte Gordo, as well as Cova/Paul/Ribeira da Torre, Moro\u00e7os and Monte Verde, are important sites located in mountain areas. In the 2015 National Report on the State of Biodiversity, the National Directorate for the Environment states that rainfed agriculture continues to be an economic activity that competes with native vegetation, with its action in mountain ecosystems, such as Monte Verde, (S\u00e3o Vicente), Santo Ant\u00e3o, Santiago and Fogo being better known. The Third National Communication on Climate Change, in 2018, admits that mountain ecosystems are among the most sensitive and vulnerable to climate change and recommends that management and conservation measures be taken for the most sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems, such as mountains, dune systems, wetlands and coastal ecosystems, to increase the resilience of their species to climate change. The country's first red list of endangered spe - cies dates back to 1997. The existing red list indicates that endangered species account for 20% of total species in Cabo Verde. How - ever, with the new Nature Conservation Union guidelines on species conservation status, the number of endangered species is likely to increase. Cabo Verde has poor flora and fauna biodiversity that needs protection. The 2020 White Paper on the Environment records that Cabo Verde has 3,382 terres- trial species, with 368 species of fungi and lichens, 915 species of plants and 2,099 species of animals. Taking into account the indicated percentage, about 676 species are threatened with extinction. However, the update of the red list of Cabo Verde's spe - cies of flora and fauna is already underway and, for endemic flora, reptiles and birds, the update is already complete. Cabo Verde has poor flora and fauna biodi- versity and there is no record of the com- mercialization or trafficking of wild species. The strategy for the management of invasive plants in the forest areas of the Natural Parks is in line with guidelines related to the planning and management of invasive species in the island territories of the IUCN, the last edition of which dates back to 2018 (IUCN, 2018). The Natural Parks in opera - tion have been implementing the actions proposed within the framework of the Management Strategy for Invasive Plants in terrestrial parks (Fogo, Santo Ant\u00e3o and S\u00e3o Vicente) for the gradual elimination and occupation of removal areas by endemic species. The actions developed in the Serra da Malagueta Natural Park are highlighted in this table, where the invaders were replaced by endemic species (Echium hypertropicum, Euphorbia tuckeyana, Artemisia gorgonum). Overall, it is worth mentioning the progress registered in conducting and managing the Environmental Impact Assessment processes, the favorable environment for the creation of the legal framework for the Strategic Environmental Assessment and the modernization, updating and continuous adaptation of the environmental legisla - tion that favor non-invasive actions on the environment. 129 The Aichi biodiversity goals are fully inte - grated into Cabo Verde's development, through the Strategic Sustainable Develop - ment Plan (PEDS), the Biodiversity Conserva - tion and Environmental Quality Program, and under the 2014-2030 Strategic Biodiversity Plan and plans for the management of pro - tected areas. Regarding Aichi Goals 1, 2 and 4, the envi- ronmental awareness process is continuous, through actions at the level of protected areas and the entire civil society and in harmony with public entities and NGOs; with regard to Targets 3, 4 and 7, plans and actions in the field of renewable energies have been implemented, as have special plans for spatial planning in protected areas and coastal zones; with regard to Target 11, the areas protected by Decree 3/2003 and 18.2% of ecologically representative terres - trial land are conserved through protected areas with special plans for protected areas; and with regard to Goals 9 and 12, the imple - mentation of management and conservation plans for threatened and priority preserved and valued species is highlighted. Development assistance and expenditures allocated to the conservation and sustain - able use of biodiversity and ecosystems are indicated in the Public Investment Pro - gram (State Budget). Cabo Verde has been assisted by several development partners, namely Portugal, the United Nations, the GEF, the International Union For Conser - vation Of Nature, the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development, the World Meteorological Organization, MAVA and FAO. In the last 5 years (2016 to 2020), US$ 26,950,310 were allocated to the \"Biodiversity Conservation and Environmental Quality\" program, of which US$ 698,993 were donated, equivalent to about 2.6% of public expenditure on this program. However, public expenditures with this program have been decreasing, from US$ 8,219,174 in 2015 to US$ 5,077,403 in 2020, i.e. a reduction of US$ 3,141,772, which represents an average annual decrease of 8.2% between 2015 and 2020, a drop that has to do mainly with treasury resources, which decreased by an average of 9.8% per year, while non-debt-producing financing grew by an average of around 31.3% per year. Cabo Verde has a remarkable history in terms of integrating ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounting systems. The 2017-2021 Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (PEDS), which is still in force, has as major references the Government Program of the 9th Legislature and the Sustainable Development Goals. One of the objectives of this strategic instrument is \"Ensuring Economic and Environmental Sustainability,\" which has as one of its strategic guidelines the adoption of an agenda for the preser - vation of the environment and biodiversity. Under the PEDS, the Government recog - nizes the need and the major importance of adopting integrated policies in the field of the environment to ensure the sustainable management of environmental resources, ensure society's enjoyment of environmental quality and enhance the appreciation of the environment as an asset and factor of economic competitiveness of the country, bearing in mind the balance between the satisfaction of current needs and the fair expectations of future generations. It is worth mentioning that Cabo Verde is a country that, from the outset, has always been ready to align with international legal instruments that guide the preservation of the environment on a global scale. As such, in October 1994 Cabo Verde adhered to the United Nations Convention to Combat 130 Desertification (UNCCD) and was the first African country and the second in the world to ratify the aforementioned Convention, in February 1995, with the Program of Action to Combat Desertification, duly aligned with the Ten-Year Strategy of the Convention to Combat Desertification - UNCCD. Cabo Verde's efforts in combating desertification, from independence up to the present, are notable and the results palpable in the exponential increase in forested areas and in measures aimed at controlling erosion and preserving land. The non-existence of a Biodiversity Obser - vatory and of solid statistical information that allow for the follow-up and effective monitoring of indicators makes it difficult to present the real state of biodiversity in the country. However, despite these shortcomings, surveys carried out with local partners reveal that on islands where Pro- tected Areas have been implemented, bio - diversity is in a better state of conservation. Erosion and runoff have contributed to significant annual losses of topsoil, leading to a reduction in soil fertility and jeopardizing agricultural sustainability and food security. To combat degradation and to guarantee agricultural production, suc - cessive governments have implemented a vast soil and water conservation program, with the construction of mechanical and biological structures for soil conservation and water collection measures (water har - vesting). Some examples include landfills, vegetable hedges, large surface runoff water retention dams, catchment dams and ter - races, among others. Despite the positive impacts resulting from the country's efforts in the fight against desertification and land degradation, land degradation and loss of soil quality prevail across the country, occurring in different forms and proportions. Degraded soils, with low organic matter content and, consequently, organic carbon, need to be restored and/or rehabilitated, through sustainable management, so that they can contribute to the mitigation of climate change. Cabo Verdean authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to the protection of life on Earth and undertake to create the conditions for Cabo Verde to protect, recover and value its biodiversity and geodiversity, promote the sustainable use of these resources, and enhance mechanisms for participation and the appropriation of benefits in a fair and equitable manner, contributing to the promotion of environmental quality and sustainable development in the country.. They have taken on the responsibility to promote: Environmental sustainability in a coherent way throughout national territory, strengthening environmental regulation, inspection and auditing;Improving environmental governance with a focus on improving intersectoral coordina- tion, to ensure the smooth implementation of environmental policies and regulations; Consolidation and improvement of the promotion of the National Network of Pro- tected Areas, Ramsar Sites and Biosphere Reserves; the creation of a network of natural monuments where the conservation of geodi - versity will give rise to new centers of tourist attraction and knowledge; A governance model that improves the ade - quacy and integration of biodiversity and geodiversity management; The guarantee that environmental com - ponents of nature conservation and preservation of biodiversity, geodiversity and landscapes are considered within the scope of public policies for agriculture, fisheries, exploitation of natural resources, energy, land use planning and tourism; Strengthening the prevention and control of invasive alien species and agricultural and forestry diseases and pests, particularly in protected areas; A Payment for Environmental Services Program, as a measure to combat environ - mental degradation and compensation for individual or collective initiatives that favor the maintenance, recovery or improvement of ecosystem services.131 SDG 16. PEACE, JUSTICE AND EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONS132SDG 16. PEACE, JUSTICE AND EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONS Strong Systems and Institutions consti - tute essential pillars of the accelerators of sustainable development. Indeed, without peace, justice, stability, human rights and effective governance based on the rule of law, we will not be able to achieve sus - tainable development. Cabo Verde leads the most important human development, transparency, freedom and good governance rankings in Africa, and we are aware that external credibility is one of the country's main assets and is mainly the result of our democratic history, transparency and good governance. Security and justice are sec - tors that have been the object of particular attention on the part of the Government, and we are turning things around by heading up the ramp of a decrease in violence and improvement in access to justice. These five years have been profoundly characterized by progress in terms of justice, peace, good governance, partnerships and the consolidation of democratic institutions and the reinforcement of conditions of sta - bility, as well as long-term commitments to sustainable development. According to data from the National Police, in 2019 Cabo Verde registered a rate of 6.2 intentional homicides per 100,000 inhabi - tants, a 2.6 percentage point drop in com - parison to 2015. In Cabo Verde, intentional homicides occur more often among men than among women. In 2019, there were 5.1 homicides per 100,000 men in contrast with 1.1 per 100,000 women. These levels, for their part, were below those seen in 2017, when the country registered 6 per 100,000 men and 1.1 per 100,000 women. Intentional homicides are more frequent among individuals between 31 and 45 years of age (2.2 per 100,000 inhabitants), followed by those above 45 (1.5 per 100,000 inhabi - tants), those between 22 and 30 (1.3), those between 17 and 21 (1.1) and those below 12 years of age (0.2 per 100,000 inhabitants). In Cabo Verde no mortalities related to conflicts are registered, due to the non-existence of conflicts in our territory. The 3rd Demographic and Reproductive Health Inquiry (IDSR III) carried out by the National Statistics Institute (INE) in 2018 is the only recent study available on physi - cal, psychological or sexual violence in the population. According to the inquiry, 11% of women between 15 and 49 years of age had suffered physical violence in the preceding 12 months, and the same proportion of women had at one time or another been victims of this type of violence since their 15th birth - day. Some 3% of women in this age bracket had been victims of sexual violence in the 12 months preceding the inquiry and 6% of women in the same group affirmed they had been victims of this type of violence at some point in their lives. Slightly more than one in every ten women (14%) had suffered emotional violence from their partners in the 12 months prior to the inquiry. According to the 2019 Afrobarometer study, at least 56 out of every 100 people 18 or older residing in Cabo Verde interviewed claimed that they or their family members 133 had never felt unsafe walking in their neigh - borhood. Only 15.3% of these affirmed that they or a relative had felt unsafe on several occasions while walking in their neighbor - hood, while 11.3% said they often felt unsafe and 7.4% of those interviewed claimed that they or a relative always felt unsafe walking their neighborhood. The men interviewed felt safer than the women while walking in their own neigh - borhood, as approximately 57.5% of men interviewed declared they or their relatives had never felt unsafe while walking in their neighborhood, as opposed to 54% of women. The perception of lack of safety is higher in urban than in rural areas. As such, 85.4% of rural dwellers interviewed affirmed they or their relatives had never felt unsafe while walking in their neighborhood, as opposed to only 43.6% of those interviewed in urban areas. According to the report from the Public Ministry, in the 2019/2020 judicial year no cases related to the crime of human trafficking were registered or solved, meaning that the 11 (eleven) cases that rolled over from the previous judicial year remain pending. Crimes against persons are categorized as cases of physical, psychological or sexual violence. According to data from the National Directorship of the National Police, in 2020 1.3 crimes against persons occurred per 100,000 inhabitants, representing a reduc - tion from the levels registered in 2015, when 2.5 crimes of this type occurred per 100,000 inhabitants. According to data provided by the National Directorate of Prison Systems and Social Reintegration, there are currently 1,798 inmates in Cabo Verde's prisons, 97.4% of which are male. Approximately 19.5% of inmates are being jailed preventively (in other words, their sentences have yet to be handed down), with the rate of prisoners remanded in custody standing at 19.6% among male inmates and 13% among female inmates. Cabo Verde is a country governed by the rule of law, and the Government recognizes social peace as one of the most important conditions necessary in order to guaran - tee an environment of economic growth and sustainable development grounded on predictability and on the existence of and compliance with clear and objective social relationship rules. Social peace is indissociable from a speedy justice system and judicial security and is incompatible with the current situation of moroseness in the justice sector. Security and justice are sectors that have come to merit particular attention on the part of the Government, and a trend has been seen in reducing violence and improving access to justice. Through the Ministry of Justice, the Govern - ment ensures access to justice by way of the Global Communication - Legal Information Project, which is an integrated information system aimed at ensuring knowledge of all of the legislation produced in Cabo Verde to all citizens, regardless of their economic or financial conditions, providing them with basic and necessary information that can allow them to react when their rights or interests are violated. Between 2017 and 2020, approximately 4,136 citizens benefited from the legal information system at various focal points throughout the country. Of these 4,136 citizens, 2,808 were female and 1,328 male. It should be stressed that all of the information requests made were attended to. Through the Legal Cabo Verde is the only country in Africa classified with an \"insignificant\" level of insecurity, and has the lowest safety risk for tourist travel in the continent. Over the last 5 years, violence and related mortality fell significantly. 134Assistance Guarantee Project, the Ministry of Justice ensures access to legal assistance services to all natural and legal persons able to prove they do not have the economic means to pay all or a part of the normal costs of legal proceedings or fees due to legal professionals (lawyers or paralegals) for their services. The Cabo Verdean Institute of Children and Teenagers (ICCA) has registered an increase in the number of reported cases of sexual abuse of children in recent years, making the sexual abuse of children the most common sexual crime during the 2016/2017 judicial year, accounting for 35% of the 523 sexual crime cases registered by the Prosecutor General's Office. The victims are almost exclusively girls, with nearly a third of cases happening within the family. Between Janu - ary and June of 2020, ICCA received 86 cases of sexual abuse (2020 mid-year report). The resolution of cases is limited due to the limited investigation carried out by Judiciary Police, the low level of support for children in contact with law enforcement, the weak institutional response and the slowness of the justice system in general. There is no specific court for dealing with sexual crime and no specialized court to take care of children during the trial proceedings. There is no data regarding the total volume of illicit financial inflows and outflows (in current US dollar amounts). Nevertheless, in terms of money laundering, Cabo Verde has a legal and institutional framework consistent with the country's money laun - dering risk profile. Trials and convictions have occurred of individuals responsible for money laundering for third parties as well as self-laundering. According to the National Directorship of the National Police, 52 people were arrested in 2020 for illegal possession of firearms (24) or bladed weapons (28), a figure lower than that seen in 2015, when 113 people were arrested for the illegal possession of firearms (62) or bladed weapons (51). According to the Global Corruption Barometer Africa 2019, some 63% of those interviewed said they had had contact with a public school in the preceding 12 months, and 72.3% with a public health center or hospital. 44.9% said they had attempted to obtain an identification document such as a birth certificate, driver's license, passport, voter ID card or identity card, and 16.7% said they had requested the assistance of the police. Among those interviewed who had had contact with public schools, 1% said they had had to pay a bribe, give a gift or do a favor for a faculty member or employee of the public school in order to obtain the services they required. This figure stood at 1.4% among those who had used public health centers or hospitals, 1% among those who had attempted to obtain an iden - tification document and 0.1% among those who had requested the assistance of police. Among those interviewed who had attempted to obtain an identification document such as a birth certificate, driver's license, passport, voter ID card or identity card, 11% said they had found it difficult to obtain the document they needed, and among those who had requested the assistance of the police, 7.1% said they had found it difficult to obtain the assistance they needed. The government's level of execution of primary expenditures in the budget is high, Although we are aware it is not free of risk, Cabo Verde has no record of illegal financial flows or illegal weapons flows worthy of concern. Weapons possessed illegally have been recovered. In 2019, Cabo Verde came in third place in the Transparency International Cor- ruption Perceptions Index among those countries with the lowest perception of corruption. This ranking was maintained in 2020. Even so, a Corruption Prevention Council was created and is currently in its implementation phase. 135 having reached 93.3% of the scheduled total in 2019, 1.1 percentage points below 2015 levels. In 2020, provisional data points to an execution rate of 91% of the planned total. The level of execution of the expenditures outlined in the State Budget bears witness to the government's level of transparency, but above all to the effectiveness of the performance of tax revenues, which during the pandemic period financed 59.4% of the budget that was executed (in comparison to 76.8% in 2019). In terms of public office, Cabo Verde has a President of the Republic elected for a five- year term in office, with a maximum limit of two terms, a Parliament with 72 legislators, 22 Municipal Mayors, 116 Municipal Coun - cilmen and Councilwomen, 22 Municipal Assembly Speakers and 320 Municipal Elected Officials. According to data from the 8th Round of the Public Opinion Survey in Cabo Verde carried out by Afrobarometer among Cabo Verdean citizens of 18 years of age and above, some 62.6% approved or strongly approved of the way the President of the Republic had performed his duties in the preceding 12 months or had not heard enough about him to have an opinion. A total of 39.7% had the same assessment of the Prime Minister, 38.8% had this assessment of the country's legislators, 34.1% had this assessment of municipal council members and 43.3% had this assessment of mayors. At the same time, 83.6% and 86.5% of those interviewed affirmed that council members and national legislators never or rarely do their best to listen to the concerns of people like them. As such, although the role of legislators in the National Assembly, which is the center of power in the country, and of municipal government, which are responsible for the branch of government closest to the population and constitute one of the most important gains of Cabo Verde's democracy, is unquestionable, these entities must improve their proximity to the population in order to ensure that decision-making on all levels is increasingly inclusive, participatory and representative, improving the manage - ment of people's expectations in a country where some 31% of the population still lives in absolute poverty. In Cabo Verde, the late registration of chil - dren is a challenge that has been overcome, as, according to the 2010 Census, at the time 97% of all children were registered. According to the 2018 Statistical Report on the SDG Indicators published by the INE, in 2015, 98 out of 100 children under 5 years of age were registered, a figure that stood at 99 in 2019. Birth registration is the first action undertaken to provide individuals with a civil identity, and opens the doors to all of the rights enshrined in the Constitution and in other laws of the Republic, and failure to register children represents an obstacle to their being able to enjoy the benefits of citizenship, in addition to limiting their access to various services and programs. Through the Register at Birth Program, Cabo Verdean authorities promote aware - ness-raising in the form of communicational and informational activities and direct contact highlighting the importance and mandatory nature of registering children immediately after birth. In this scope, regis - tration posts were created in the country's central hospitals and in the Santo Ant\u00e3o and North Santiago regional hospitals. Newborns are registered at the hospital or mater - nity ward immediately after birth by a civil registry official, reducing the risk of setbacks in terms of the registration of children. Cabo Verde leads the Public Governance ranking in Sub-Saharan Africa and occupies second place in terms of good governance and quality of life. We are the third most economically free country in Africa, and are in the Top 20 for Doing Business in the African region136In Cabo Verde, there have been no cases seen of the murder, kidnapping, enforced disappearance, arbitrary arrest or torture of journalists, associated media professionals, union officials or human rights defenders. The only case of attacks on journalists that stands out was a defamation case dating back to 2002. There is no law regulating the constitutional right to access to public information, but the issue of transparency and accountability has been reinforced through a series of reforms and measures such as the creation of the Finance Ministry portal and the publication and dissemination of monthly accounts and daily reports, in addition to quarterly and annual accounts. Cabo Verde leads the ranking of Public Governance in Sub-Saharan Africa and occu - pies 1st place in the African region in terms of civil and political freedoms. In Cabo Verde journalists, associated media professionals, union leaders and human rights defenders do not experience torture. In recent years Cabo Verde has consistently been among the top 30 positions in Reporters Without Bor - ders' World Press Freedom ranking. Unions freely carry out their mission and, indeed, alongside employers and the government, signed a strategic concertation accord for the 2017-2021 period with the objective, among other things, of promoting economic growth, expanding decent work and reducing regional asymmetries. This accord has been complied with. Journalists are unionized and the country has a Media Regulatory Agency responsible for regulation and which assesses and rules on cases of alleged rights violations submitted by any journalist or public or private entity that believes its right to information or image has been harmed. According to Reporters Without Borders 2020, Cabo Verde improved 0.35 percentage points in the Press Freedom Index and is in 25th place worldwide in the ranking of 180 countries assessed. According to Reporters Without Borders, Cabo Verde stands out due to the absence of attacks against journalists and its high level of press freedom, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, and high - lights the Government's decision in 2019 to approve a bill renouncing its power to appoint the administrators of the country's main public radio and television broadcaster, R\u00e1dio Televis\u00e3o de Cabo Verde (RTC). The five members of the independent board of directors are approved by the General Assembly of RTC and, for the first time in the holding company's history, were recently appointed without the interference of the government. Cabo Verde's independent national human rights institution is the National Commission for Human Rights and Citizenship (CNDHC), which was instituted in 2004 and is charged with protecting, promoting and strengthen - ing human rights, citizenship and Interna - tional Humanitarian Law in Cabo Verde. The Commission enjoys autonomy and indepen - dence from public authorities and private interests and functions as a consultative and monitoring body for public policies in the realm of its attributions, which include aspects such as: promotion and education, participation in the definition and execution of public policies, the formulation of recom - mendations related to national legislation and public policies, the elaboration and submission to the government of bills of law, the coordination of the process of the elaboration of reports to be presented to the government and to Human Rights entities, serving as a consultant to the government, the investigation of attacks on Human Rights 137 and the connection between International Law and domestic norms. However, the institution's statutes currently need to be altered in order to bring it into compliance with the Paris principles and ensure greater independence. The CNDHC reports that it has had no accounts in the past 12 months of populations who have felt attacked based on discriminatory motives prohibited by international human rights laws. Cabo Verde leads most human development, transparency, freedom and good governance rankings in Africa, and we are aware that external credibility is one of the country's greatest assets and is, more than anything else, the result of its democratic history, transparency and good governance. Firm steps have been taken in Public Administration reform with the production of a new legal instrument for the recruitment and selection of intermediate level person - nel and directors in public administration. We have carried out the pilot phase of the digitalization of the recruitment and selec - tion process, created a new performance management model, elaborated a new Basic Law regulating public employment and a new plan for the management of functions, careers and remunerations, computerized the retirement pension process in Public Administration with the creation of an electronic system that supports the digital payment flow process, created the legal framework for the regularization of precari- ous working contracts, and proceeded with active dissemination on access to and use of administrative documents and informa - tion related to the activities carried out by public bodies and entities. Also under way is the dematerialization of the National Public Administration Directorate archive, and the law creating the mobile digital key has been approved. We have ushered in a new era in the rela - tionship with civil society organizations, one geared toward programs, and restructured family and social inclusion programs. We have created and implemented the Single Social Registry that allows all relationships with civil society organizations and NGOs to be guided into consistent ends and objec - tives, with more transparent criteria and greater effectiveness. Cabo Verde leads most human develop - ment, transparency, freedom and good governance rankings in Africa, and we are aware that external credibility is one of the country's greatest assets and is, more than anything else, the result of its democratic history, transparency and good governance. 138 Cabo Verdean authorities have renewed and reinforced their commitment to justice, peace and effective institutions - in other words, to the strengthening of decentralization, investment in local and regional development and the convergence of municipalities and islands around the SDGs; to effective, quicker, more accessible, impartial and transparent justice based on respect for citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees and on the principles of democratic rule of law, promoting a culture of peace, safety and the promotion of the country's competitiveness, able to issue rulings in a reasonable timeframe and with a predictable maximum duration of cases, whether they are making their way through local district courts or in appeals or higher courts, having accepted the challenge of promoting permanent synergy among the various components of the system with the essential objective of overcoming morose -ness in judicial proceedings and achieving the result desired by all - in other words, quick and effective justice in favor of a peaceful, inclusive, fair society free of fear and violence; and an atmosphere of safety that promotes citizens' full development and prosperity, within a context of peace, security, the conscious and participatory exercise of citizens' rights and duties and respect for the fundamental rights of human beings. Cabo Verde's authorities have renewed their commitment to democracy, transparency and good governance, and will promote: the consolidation of Cabo Verdean democracy, namely through the digital transformation of central and local public administration to enhance transparency and oversight of public actions and, in general, for the digi - talization of the Cabo Verdean economy; the reinforcement of the commitment of State Public Finance Management System Actors to results-based management and trans - parency; the perfecting of technical and jurisdictional oversight of public accounts by high-level supervisory authorities, with a focus on the evaluation of national sustain - able development efforts; the enhancement of the role of the Ministry of Finances as the leader of the National Planning System, with an emphasis on monitoring and evaluation in order to ensure the effectiveness of social and political oversight and the progressive achievement of sustainable development; and the full operationality of the Public Finances Council, leading to a reinforce - ment of the mechanisms that ensure the consistency, compliance and sustainability of budget policy and the reinforcement of corruption prevention mechanisms with the full operationality of thew Corruption Prevention Council. Cabo Verdean authorities are committed to promoting a more participatory democracy, aimed at protecting and promoting citizens' rights and permanently perfecting demo - cratic rule of law with the enhancement of legislative and oversight functions, as well as the fostering of the proximity and progressive modernization of democratic institutions, the consolidation of the inde - pendence and pluralism of the media, and the promotion of policies and spaces for debate, ensuring inclusive and represen - tative participation in decision-making processes at all levels and, in particular, among youth and women. 139 SDG 17. PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OBJECTIVES140SDG 17. PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OBJECTIVES Since independence, development financing has been one of Cabo Verde's greatest challenges, arising from its status as a lower-middle-income Small Island Developing State (SIDS) faced with internal and external vulnerabilities, territorial dis - continuity and a reduced market, subject to disasters and highly vulnerable to climate change and excessive indebtedness. Partner - ship is one of the essential mechanisms of the context for the achievement, and, above all, acceleration of sustainable development. With the resumption of economic growth in 2016 and the improvement in the efficiency of tax administration, tax revenues grew from 19.2% of GDP in 2015 to 21.6% in 2019, with a perspective to continue growing, but this dynamic was interrupted in 2020 with the economic recession of 14.8% and the consequent fall in tax revenues, which now account for around 19.5% of national wealth. In other words, we are practically back at 2015 levels. With the growth in tax revenues, the financing of the State Budget through taxes has grown since 2015, rising from 74.3% that year and reaching a maximum of 84.6% of GDP in 2018, with a significant drop in 2019, a year in which it reached about 76.8%, but this dynamic was interrupted due to the drop in these revenues, which covered only 59.9% of the State Budget in 2020. As a result of the graduation from Cabo Verde to middle-income country status in 2007, official development assistance has been decreasing, from 10.5% of GDP in 2015 to 9.4% in 2019, although it grew to 12% of GDP in 2020, due to international solidarity and the postponement of disbursements in the context of the fight against the pan- demic.Cabo Verde prioritizes the promotion of foreign direct investment as a form of financing development through the move- ment of capital that does not increase external indebtedness, but which, above all, helps accessing world markets for goods and especially services, the mobilization of knowledge, technology and know-how capa - ble of driving innovation, valuing existing business opportunities in the country for the dynamic insertion of Cabo Verde into the World Economic System. Like in most other Small Island States (except Singapore) and Developing Econo - mies, Foreign Direct Investment decreased between 2016 and 2019, and there was no significant diversification in terms of the sectors and islands taking in these inves - timents. During this period, FDI decreased from 125,965,898 USD in 2016 to 74,836,777 USD in 2020, thus decreasing from 7.6% to 4.4% of GDP over the period in question. The implementation of the 2017-2021 PEDS has so far benefited from an important national financing effort through domestic revenues, but a num- ber of partnerships are also worthy of highlight, namely the United Nations, the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the French Development Agency, the European Investment Bank, the BIDC - The ECOWAS Bank, the FIDA Bank and the ABEDA, the Kuwait Fund, the OFID, the China Eximbank, Belgium, Austria and Hungary. 141 Remittances from \u00e9migr\u00e9s continue to be one of the pillars of exchange rate sus - tainability, reaching some 12.6% of GDP in 2020 - in other words, accounting for almost the same weight as ODA. Remittances from \u00e9migr\u00e9s showed an average growth of 3.8% between 2016 and 2020, far below expectations formulated in the preparation of the PEDS and lower than the dynamics observed before 2016. Remittances mainly come from Portugal (27.7%), France (23.4%) and the United States (22.3%). The growth of remittances was more intense in rural than in urban areas, certainly because of the reinforcement of the solidarity of \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the bad agricultural years that occurred in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Cabo Verde is a Middle-Income Country, but one with a high level of global indebtedness, which was reduced from 127.8% of GDP in 2016 to 124.2% of GDP in 2019, thanks to a sustained effort of fiscal consolidation, but which rebounded to 154.9% in 2020, due to the 14.8% drop in GDP in the context of the expansion of expenses in the context of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in indebtedness to cover the gap caused by the drop in domestic revenues. The level of indebtedness is sustainable, as the debt service represented, in 2020, about 4.2%, having been, on average, 2.9% of exports in the period from 2016 to 2019. Cabo Verdean authorities will resume fiscal consolidation to reach around 112.1% in 2026. However, structural changes and priorities emerged out of COVID-19 and Cabo Verde Ambition 2030, namely in the fight against impoverishment and health security and, in particular, the diversification of the economy. Thus, the expansion of public investment to make projects with a transforming character and the diversification of the economy can - not be postponed, particularly in a context of over-indebtedness aggravated by the pan - demic and by Cabo Verde's Middle-Income Country status. External debt forgiveness is therefore vital, even if in part, so that investments with a transformative impact are not postponed, but also to avoid the blockade, if not the collapse, of the State, and the setback and destruction of the dreams of Cabo Verdeans. Cabo Verde has been implementing invest - ment promotion regimes for more than a decade, having adopted, in 2012, the Invest - ment Code approved by Law No. 13/VIII/2012, which establishes the general bases that allow for the acceleration and facilitation of carrying out investments in Cabo Verde, as well as rights, guarantees and incen -tives to be granted to investments likely to contribute to Cabo Verde's socioeconomic development. The legal system relating to the promotion of investments also comprises Law-Decree no. 42/2015, on the One-Stop Shop for Inves - tors, the Tax Benefit Code (CBF), Law no. 91/ IX /2020, on Special Economic Zones, the \u00c9migr\u00e9 Investor Statute, which establishes the rules that regulate the carrying out of direct investment on the part of Cabo Verde \u00e9migr\u00e9s approved by Law No. 73/IX/2020, the Differential Merit Project approved by Law No. 80/IX/2020, Law No. 30/IX/2018, which creates a differentiated status for the holder of a second residence, through the issuance of a Green Card, the Young Start-up Program created by Resolution No. 34/2017, the VAT credit scheme on pur - chases of water and electricity exclusively for agricultural purposes, as well as the cash 142VAT regime in the transfer of said goods, approved through Law-Decree no. 78/2020. Cabo Verde TradeInvest is the public entity with the mission of promoting sustainable, inclusive and balanced economic growth in Cabo Verde through the mobilization of quality investments and the stimula - tion of exports of products and services, in order to improve the quality of life of the Cabo Verdeans in terms of employ - ment opportunities and social mobility. Cabo Verde TradeInvest has the mandate to generate investment, promote exports, facilitate and mentor investors, facilitate and mentor exporters, brand and disseminate the country's image and advocate for the improvement of the business environment. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Communities, Cabo Verde is a signatory or party to at least 74 cooperation agree- ments in science and technology, especially bilateral ones, for example, with UNESCO, Portugal, Senegal, AID, Continental Platform, the AfDB, ECOWAS, Argentina, Equatorial Guinea, Luxemburg, Brazil, Russia, Cuba, Nigeria, the PALOPs, Bulgaria, Tunisia, Germany, North Korea, Guinea Bissau, The Republic of Guinea, Niger, Angola, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Spain, France, Gabon, Hungary and the Czech Republic, namely in terms of loans to finance the \"Technology Park\" project, in the field of climate change, in the sector of new technologies and in the fields of scientific research and fisheries. Connectivity is one of the important ele - ments in the effort to \"Leave no one behind.\" Indeed, digital inclusion is essential for access to information and knowledge, for citizens' participation and for taking advan - tage of economic and social opportunities. Thus, over the last 10 years, projects have been implemented in order to promote accessibility for all, including the massifica - tion of internet access, the extension of the scope of universal service, with the inclusion of broadband internet services in the uni - versal service and the establishment of the Universal Service Fund and the Development of the Information Society, with regard to the development of the national broadband strategy and the Internet for all program. According to the Multisectorial Regulatory Agency for the Economy (ARME), broadband Internet subscriptions have grown in the last 5 years, reaching 75 per 100 inhabitants in 2020, with 99.3% for GSM and 94.7% for 3G, a significant increase in relation to 2015, in which broadband Internet subscription reached 98.8% for GSM and 86.8% for 3G. In 2019, 4G was introduced, with subscriptions to this generation's broadband Internet since settled at 79.4 per 100 inhabitants. In Cabo Verde, around 61.9% of the popu- lation uses the internet, with a slight pre- dominance by men (62.9%), as compared to women (61.0%), but internet use is much more expressive in urban areas (69.0%) than in rural areas (46.5%), mainly due to the ease of access in urban areas, where the essentials of public administration, compa - nies and public squares with free WiFi are located, as well as better network coverage - in urban areas, there are rarely any regions without coverage.Globally, internet use is particularly high among 15-24 year-olds, as 80 out of 100 use internet, followed by 25-34 year-olds (83.7%), but also among adults, i.e. in the 35-64 year-old group (57.0%). However, in urban areas as in rural areas, internet use is more expressive among young people aged 25-34 (87% and 75.5%), around 2.1 and 4.8 percentage points above young people aged 1-24, respectively, and is also relatively high among urban adults (65.2%). Internet use has expanded rapidly, as the proportion of the population using the inter - net in 2019 is some 11.5 percentage points above the 2016 level, with 12 percentage points among men and 11.2 percentage points among women, and the growth in home access is of the same order of magnitude. It has not been the practice in Cabo Verde to calculate the weighted average of customs tariffs. 143 Table 21.

This dynamic was interrupted in 2020, the year in which the economy went into recession (-14.8%) as a result of the pandemic, thus resulting in an average growth of 0.5% over the course of these 5 years as a whole. According to the National Statistics Institute (INE), the unemployment rate continued to decline during this period, from 15% of the Economically Active Population (EAP) in 2016 to 11.3% in 2019, the lowest rate seen since 2010. During the period, 11,859 net jobs were created, but in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment worsened with the loss of about 19,700 jobs, setting the unem- ployment rate at 14.5%, around 3.2 percentage points above the previous year.In the monetary sector, data from the Central Bank (BCV) show that the money supply grew by an average of 5.8% in the period, mainly due to the country's liquid assets abroad, reflecting the performance of external accounts. Net Domestic Credit grew on average 3.5%, and the Credit to the Economy rose from 60.6% of GDP in 2016, reached a minimum of 59.0% in 219 and a maximum of 73.3% in 2020. The Credit to the private sector growing on average 4.3% as a result of increased confidence on the parts of banks and greater demand on the part of families and businesses. Net international reserves grew by an average of 6%, guaranteeing 6.7 months of imports in the period, above the minimum threshold, and ensuring compliance with the exchange cooperation agreement. The nominal effective exchange rate index saw insignificant variations, with the average of the period 103.0 and the same behavior for the real effective exchange rate index, with a period average of 128.5. The average dollar exchange rate varied between a maxi - mum of 99.7 escudos in 2016 and a minimum of 93.2 escudos in 2018, with the average for the period being 97.3 escudos. The country's external accounts were strengthened in the period. The current account deficit continued on a downward trajectory, going from 3.8% of GDP in 2016 to 0.4% of GDP in 2019, but worsening in 2020, when it reached 16.5% due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had as one of its effects a drop in exports, especially in services, as a result of the near stoppage of tourism and, in general, the drastic reduction in international mobility. Until 2019, Public Finances maintained a path of consolidation that was interrupted in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which deter - mined the reorientation of budget priorities and a decrease in domestic revenues. The global deficit has consistently remained below 3% of GDP, reaching a minimum value of 2.4% of GDP in 2019, but worsened in 2020, reaching 8.8% due to the effect of the pandemic. The stock of public debt, excluding TCMF, decreased from 127.8% of GDP in 2016 to 124.2% of GDP, a 3.7 percentage point drop in the period. However, with the impact of COVID-19, the public debt ratio reached 154.9% of GDP in 2020, reflecting the increase in financing to face the sharp fall in revenue and the need for spending to fight the pandemic, in addition to fixed and mandatory expenses. In Cabo Verde, the Sustainable Development Goals are operationalized by the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (PEDS), which is in line with the SDGs. As evidenced by PEDS 2017-2021, the 2016-2021 Government Program is deeply impregnated by the SDGs. This will also be the case with the 10th Legislature Government Program, which will have Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda as a reference. The Implementation Coordination Mecha - nism was established in the SDG Roadmap approved by the Government at the end of 2019. It is essentially based on valuing the role of the National Planning System, the 145 National Statistical System and Govern - ment decision-making bodies, and is part of Cabo Verde's 2030 Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda and will be approved by the National Parliament. Cabo Verdean authorities undertake techni - cal and political dialogue with development partners using planning instruments, i.e., the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan, sector plans and the State Budget. The dialogue on sustainable development car - ried out with the United Nations and other partners uses this planning instrument, which is aligned with and operationalizes the SDGs in Cabo Verde. This dialogue was deepened with the Cabo Verde Ambition 2030 exercise, which mobi- lized Cabo Verdean society, the diaspora community, the business sector, public administration, academia, the media, develop - ment partners, personalities and institutions with interest in Cabo Verde, conferring a high degree of visibility, deepening the country's notoriety and credibility, creating conditions for strategic choices, cementing long-term commitments for the sustainable develop - ment of Cabo Verde and producing the Cabo Verde 2030 Strategic Sustainable Develop - ment Agenda. This agenda is an overarching instrument for aligning political subjects and social actors, guiding the next national, sec - toral, municipal and regional strategic plans, but is, above all, a long-term reference for the State, the private sector, civil society and development partners, and thus serves as a foundation for strategic dialogue for the sustainable development of Cabo Verde. In Cabo Verde, the Monitoring and Evalua - tion System has seen important progress in recent years, contributing to building solid bases for the more effective monitoring and evaluation of public policies. At the technical level, the following deserve special mention: program-based budgeting; the alignment and coherence of the different instruments, namely the Government Program, PEDS, the Medium Term Expenditure Framework and the General State Budget, in order to articulate short and medium term planning, using the same programs and results-based management through logical frameworks for monitoring and evaluating ends-based and investment programs; the standardization of the monitoring and evaluation processes of the projects through the elaboration of the Manual for the Monitoring and Evalu - ation of Public Investment Projects; and the preparation of the Procedures Manual for Monitoring and Evaluation of projects, final units and programs of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment. At a legal level, particular highlights include the creation and approval of the Basic Law for the National Planning System and the Basic Law for the State Budget, instruments that define the procedures for the planning, implementation, follow-up and evaluation of all policies enshrined in national strategic plans. With regard to the information system, the following stand out: the design and development of a new IT platform at the central level that allows for the monitoring and evaluation of all public policies enshrined in the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (PEDS), from the strategic level to the operational level, which culminates in the delivery of necessary and sufficient outcomes to achieve the specific objectives of each program. One of the major assets of the new platform has to do with the fact that it the process of planning, monitoring and evaluating future National Strategic Plans to be carried out, given its great flexibility, allowing for integration with other international agendas and the development of the monitoring and evaluation computer platform of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment (MAA). This platform is integrated with the central plat - form and allows users to monitor the level of activities and actions (micro level) carried out for the delivery of outcomes that contribute to the achievement of the specific objectives of the MAA programs. It allows, among other things, for the generation of sector-specific information, relevant to internal management. At the institutional level, it should be noted that the vast majority of the components of the Monitoring and Evaluation System have adequate academic training in terms of specific knowledge in Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). To overcome limitations, several capacity building actions on the monitoring and evaluation of public policies are being carried out, with the support of the S\u00e3o Paulo School of Economics of the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation (FGV EESP). In this cycle, the 2017-2018 PEDS Progress Report, the 2017-2020 PEDS Progress Report, the 2018 Voluntary National Report (VNR) and the 2021 Voluntary National Report (VNR) were produced.146Since 2006, Cabo Verde's National Statistical System law complies with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. Cabo Verde was an effective member of the United Nations Statistical Commission from 2004 to 2007 and, henceforth, has held the leader - ship of the Praia City Group for Governance Statistics. In 2018, the National Statistical System produced 92 SDG indicators. Of these, 37 (40.2%) were produced by INE and the remaining 55 (59.8%) by other national bodies producing statistical information. The production of some indicators does not fully follow the international recommendation, basically due to lack of data. In these situ- ations, the international indicator was used and was presented as a proxy. Published SDG 13 statistics are not SDG indicators, but are considered important to the national development process. The SDG statistical report results from the joint work of INE, other official statistics-producing bodies and other public institutions that produce statistical information. The 2019 SDG statis - tical report is about to be published. Cabo Verdean authorities adopted the 2017-2021 National Statistics Development Strategy to develop official statistics to respond to the country's major challenges, with regard to national (PEDS) and inter - national (SDG 2030) development plans and programs and the Agenda 2063 (the Africa We Want). The 2017-2021 National Statistical Development Strategy budget is about US$23 million. According to the National Statistics Institute, the funding allocated for the implemen - tation of a functional statistical system reached US$ 4,203,816 in 2019, equivalent to an average annual growth of 3.9%, but US$ 2,279,920 below the amount for the previous year. Cabo Verde has successful experience car - rying out a Population Census every 10 years since 1960, and the four censuses carried out since independence have also addressed housing. These censuses made it possible to monitor the evolution of population characteristics over time, reinforcing the consideration of demographic variables in development policies and programs and, in particular, in the national planning system. The 2020 census should have been carried out from June 16 to 30 of that year, that is, respecting the 10-year calendar, but, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was postponed and will be held from June 16 to 30, respecting the restrictions established by national health authorities. The 2021 General Population and Housing Census will provide information for the calculation of various SDG indicators, but, above all, information for the assessment of the 2017- 2021 Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (PEDS 2017-2021), as well as for the preparation of PEDS 2022-2026 and, thus, for the implementation of Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda and the monitoring of other national and international commitments. Stakeholder participation in the preparation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of PEDS 2022-2026 and the SDGs and the Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda. Sustainable development challenges are also challenges for the public sector, the 147 private sector, civil society organizations, institutions and all other stakeholders. Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda should be a reference and long-term action framework for the public sector, the private sector, civil society organizations, institutions and all other stakeholders, framing their causes in the context of sustainable development and basing their actions on global references. Participation of Civil Society Organizations Civil society organizations have contributed and are expected to upgrade their contri - bution to the mobilization of financing for sustainable development, security, internal and international connectivity, a strong state, institutions and systems, and part - nerships that shape the enabling context of sustainable development accelerators. They can and should be part of the accelerators, namely expanding participa - tion in the development of human capital through participation in education, health, gender equality, culture and creative indus - tries, but also in adding value to the tourism industry in the real economy, namely by contributing to the transformation of agri - culture, livestock and the development of transport and culture and creative indus - tries, to diversify the tourist product and respond to the demands of the tourism industry. They act and should deepen their participation in promoting the sustainable use and conservation of marine biodiversity. The post-COVID scenario represents a challenge for all, each with our own level of responsibilities, and requires alignment between Governments, CSOs and other actors. CSOs must participate and help the most disadvantaged populations in their efforts to adapt, with creativity, innovations and solidarity. They must participate in the national effort to recover our country, electing productive and social inclusion as a priority, as well as the training of the most disadvantaged populations to face the post-pandemic crisis. CSOs should take up Cabo Verde's Strate - gic Sustainable Development Agenda as an agenda of commitments and: 1. Participate in localizing the SDGs and, in short, decentralization, local and regional development and convergence to build shared prosperity; 2. Participate in accelerating the transition from the informal to the formal economy, improving the business environment, fostering micro and small businesses, promoting safe and sustainable tourism, digital transformation, the transition to the blue economy, smart agriculture and the development of culture and the creative industries. 3. Develop, with the Government, complicity for the eradication of extreme poverty and, in short, for the reduction of absolute poverty, so as not to leave anyone behind; 4. Be partners and develop complicity with local authorities for the development of local economies, decentralization, positive discrimi -nation, local development and the reduction of regional asymmetries to ensure convergence; 5. Contribute to the promotion of healthy and sustainable cities, to overcome the challenges of health security and environ - mental and economic sustainability. Participate in the implementation of Cabo Verde's Strategic Agenda for Sustainable Development. 1. Preventing exclusion, promoting the inclusion of those left behind, namely the poor and the majority of the disabled, and promoting gender equality, contributing to gender discrimination-free societies that invest in equal opportunities and capitalize on the contributions of women and men for eco - nomic growth and sustainable development; 2. Through their own projects of infor - mation, awareness raising, training and mobilization of communities, ensuring intermediation and social control, but also implementing productive inclusion projects; 3. Participating in the development of human capital, namely in education and in refocusing the training supply on the current and emerging needs of the labor market. 4. Participating in the Monitoring and Evaluation Implementation Mechanism of Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda, PEDS, Sectoral Strategic Plans and Municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans;1485. Participating in the permanent debate on sustainable development, within the scope of Cabo Verde Ambition 2030; 6. Participating in the preparation of national, regional and local sustainable development plans, as instruments for the operationalization of the sustainable development agendas of the Member States; 7. Negotiating and agreeing with Govern- ments and local authorities on partnership plans to structure and systematize their participation and contribution in the imple - mentation of these plans; 8. Making the reduction of inequalities and in particular of regional asymmetries a priority; 9. Implementing their own monitoring and evaluation systems, as observatories of the action and impacts of public interventions, but also of transparency and visibility of their actions, projects and interventions; 10. Deepening participation in the applica - tion of the labor code and in its monitoring and adequacy and, in general, in the social dialogue for lasting labor peace, aiming at the expansion of the job supply, the pro - motion of decent work, productivity and competitiveness of the national economy. 11. Participating in extending mandatory social protection coverage and social dia - logue and thereby implementing the decent work agenda;12. Participating in education for development and solidarity, namely by carrying out awareness campaigns, to make citizens familiar with the SDGs and the challenges of their implementation in Cabo Verde. 13. Promoting strategic partnerships with local authorities, the private sector, the Government, bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Private Sector Participation In Cabo Verde, private investment represents about 79% of Gross Fixed Capital Formation. The private business sector already provides about 41% of employment, including in the health sector, in complementarity with the public sector. In 2019, about 55% of INPS costs with medical and drug assistance were with private health providers. Even in the context of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Cabo Verde continues to be a preferred destination for large investors and for Foreign Direct Invest - ment, and the foreign private sector has reinforced its confidence and commitment to the country. The private sector should value opportuni - ties, mobilize partnerships, invest, produce, distribute and, above, all export and create value and jobs in sustainable tourism, in the blue economy, in the digital economy, in renewable energies, in industry, in the production, export and maintenance of health and medicine equipment, in water and sanitation, in agriculture and in health tourism. 149 It should participate in the Implementation Coordination Mechanism and in monitoring and evaluation and deepen its alignment with Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda and the Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF), in order to support the authorities in identifying the means of implementation to comply with the SDGs. It should deepen its participation in the creation of an environment conducive to continuous alignment, in the expansion of domestic financial markets, in the leveraging of development cooperation and in south- south cooperation partnerships, in the fight against illicit financing and in the develop- ment of instruments that leverage private sector participation in SDG investments, aligning development cooperation with national priorities. It should participate in the development of human capital, namely in refocusing the training supply on the current and emerging needs of the labor market and the financing of professional training. It should be a first-line partner in the focus of vocational training on young people and women, on people with disabilities and in particular on underemployed people and young people not in employment, edu - cation or training. It should participate in the enhancement of professional training, preferably recruiting young people with certified training and in defining the training curriculum. It should expand its participa - tion in the qualification and employability of young people, namely in setting up training priorities and in the provision of vocational training and professional internships. It should actively participate in promoting the sustainability of the blue economy, namely through the sustainable exploitation of marine resources and the protection and conservation of marine biodiversity, and participate in exploring the opportunities that this sector offers by developing projects for this purpose, as well as in the effective implementation of the legal and institutional framework, for the transition to the blue economy and from the stock exchange to the blue economy, at a regional level. It should play, as the largest employer, an essential role in the application of the labor code and in the monitoring and adaptation thereof, and in general in the social dialogue for lasting labor peace, aimed at expanding the job supply and promoting decent work, productivity and the competitiveness of the national economy. It should also partici - pate in the governance of the Labor Market Observatory, in the extension of coverage of mandatory social protection and in social dialogue, and thus, in the implementation of the decent work agenda. It should participate in the health develop - ment strategy for the 2030 horizon, as an operator in the provision of health services and thus in improving access to health care, contributing to equity. It should participate in the mobilization of the Cabo Verdean diaspora and in promoting their participation in the transfer of know-how, namely in the field of health, including valuing business opportunities in this field and, in this way, participating in the promotion of quality health for all Cabo Verdeans and creating value for the national economy. It should participate in mobilizing, enabling and developing public-private partnerships to accelerate digital connectivity between islands and in the digital transformation of the public and private sectors, and be part of and frontline actor in the reform of the financial sector, in financing the transforma - tion of agriculture, as well as in the creation of the financial platform. It should actively participate in the prepara - tion of the 2022-2026Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (PEDS), sector strategic plans and Municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans, as instruments for the operationalization of Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda. It should negotiate and agree with the Government and local authorities on partnership plans to structure and systematize their participation and contribution in the implementation of these plans and, consequently, Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda, namely through the decentralization of attributions and competences. At the local level, it should actively participate in local platforms for sustainable development. Participation of Local Government Entities Local Government Entities shall: Ensure the localization of the SDGs, stream - line the operation of Local Development Platforms, carry out, as local authorities, municipal responsibilities, decentralize 150responsibilities and tasks to Professional Organizations and Civil Society, ensure alignment in the design, preparation and execution of the Municipal Strategic Sus - tainable Development Plans with the PEDS and the SDGs.

Promote and defend the legitimate interests of members and participation in the preparation of the 2022-2026 and 2027-2031 Strategic Sustainable Develop - ment Plans (PEDS),sector strategic plans and the Municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans, as instruments for the operationalization of Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda. Be partners in professional training, partici - pate in the qualification and employability of young people and women, in the application of the labor code and in its monitoring, contribute to lasting social and labor dia - logue and peace, to the promotion of decent work, productivity and the competitiveness of the national economy and actively par - ticipate in social agreement, negotiate and sign on to medium and long-term strategic concertation agreements. Annual evaluation and improvement of par - ticipation mechanisms Cabo Verdean authorities will annually carry out studies, through surveys and interviews with leaders of non-state actors, focusing on the assessment of their participation, the difficulties and possible barriers to partner - ship, expectations and availability and on the conditions for effective participation in the elaboration, execution, follow-up and evaluation of 2022-2026 PEDS, the Municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans and, in short, the SDGs, through Cabo Verde's Strategic Agenda for Sustainable Development.151 3. NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS In Cabo Verde, the Sustainable Development Goals are operationalized by the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (PEDS), in line with the SDGs. As evidenced by PEDS 2017- 2021, the 2016-2021 Government Program is deeply imbued with the SDGs, which will also be the case for the Government Program of the 10th Legislature, which will have as an essential reference Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda. The Implementation Coordination Mecha - nism was established in the SDG Roadmap approved by the Government at the end of 2019. It is essentially based on valuing the role of the National Planning System, the National Statistical System and Govern - ment decision-making bodies, and is part of Cabo Verde's 2030 Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda and will be approved by the National Parliament. It is a powerful monitoring and evaluation mechanism. New and emerging challenges However, from the COVID-19 pandemic, structural changes and priorities emerge related to the fight against impoverish - ment, health security, housing security, water and sanitation and urban requalifi- cation. Priorities for the diversification of the economy, with sustainable tourism, the energy transition, the transition to the blue economy, the digital economy, and industry as a new sector of opportunities, within the framework of ECOWAS and, in particular, of the African Continental Free Trade Area, the international platform for health, smart agriculture and culture and creative industries. The expansion of public investment , esti - mated at about 500 million escudos over the next ten years, is urgently needed, to make these investments viable and, in short, ensure sustainable development, all this within the context of over-indebtedness aggravated by the pandemic, and within the constraints of Cabo Verde's status as a Middle Income Country, which makes official development assistance scarce. It is therefore vital to forgive, even if in part, the external debt, so that investments with transformative impact are not post - poned, but also to avoid the blockade, if not the collapse, of the State, the setback and destruction of the dreams of Cabo Verdeans.a). CHaLLENGES INHERENT TO SM aLL ISL aND DEVELOPING ST aTE (SIDS) ST aTUS Cabo Verde's status as a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) is at the heart of the overall strategic planning process for sustainable development until 2030 (National Development Plans 2017-21 and 2022-27, CV Sustainable Development Strategy Ambition 2030, Response Plan, Economic Recovery and Promotion, Integrated National Financing Framework), as well as monitoring the impact of public policies on the SDGs (SDG and VNR Reports 2018 and 2021). Among the 43 countries that filed their Voluntary National Report (VNR) in 2021, six are Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba and the Marshall Islands will present their VNR for the first time, and the Bahamas, Cabo Verde and the Dominican Republic for the second time. First- 152time or second-time reporting does not imply the same approach and structure, and the realities and priorities of these countries are specific, so each VNR will be unique. However, these Small Island Developing States came together in the drafting process, to include a joint section in their respective VNRs on common SIDS vulnerabilities and development challenges. This approach is fully in line with the State - ment of Accelerated Modalities of Action for Small Island Developing States, the SAMOA Path, which recognizes that SIDS con - tinue to be a special case for sustainable development, in view of their unique and particular shared vulnerabilities. Well-doc - umented, common development challenges specific to SIDS include: their small sizes, their narrow resource-based economies, their geographic and economic isolation, their dependence on trade, travel and ship - ping, high cost of transport, communication and energy, extreme vulnerability to climate change and natural hazards, the fragility of the islands' ecosystems, as well as their lack of access to concessional financing. 1. We, the six Small Island Developing States (SIDS) who this year presented our Voluntary National Report (VNR) (Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Cabo Verde, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Marshall Islands), have decided to come together to highlight our common vulnerabilities and development challenges, as well as opportunities, in our respective VNR through this common section. We come from different regions of the world, we are from different income groups, we have different national priorities and sustainable development paths, specific to our national contexts, but in line with the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. The Principle of National Ownership is central to our common pursuit of sustainable development. As a result, each of our VNRs is, of course, country-specific, as are the achievements presented therein. However, no matter how varied this progress has been so far, we all face unique structural and exogenous vulnerabilities that are shared by all SIDS countries and that are specific to us. 2. The Declaration of Accelerated Modalities of Action for Small Island Developing States, SAMOA Pathway, recognizes that SIDS con- tinue to be a special case for sustainable development, given their unique and common vulnerabilities. Well-documented, common development challenges specific to SIDS include: small land mass; small populations; geographic isolation and spatial dispersion; high cost of transport, communications and energy; low-lying areas and extreme vulnera - bility to climate change and natural hazards; fragility of island ecosystems and high level of endemism; small resource-based and undi - versified economies; remoteness from mar - kets and heavy reliance on trade, travel and remittances; high sensitivity to international fluctuations and limited trading partners; lack of access to concessional financing. These unique and specific challenges are highlighted, for example, in the SAMOA Pathway, the Sen - dai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the SDGs, the Paris Agreement, as well as the 2018 OECD report \"Making Development Co-operation Work for Small Island Developing States \" and the 2021 UNDESA Financing for Sustainable Development report\", for example. These com - 153 plex, exogenous and underlying conditions undermine the sustainable development gains of SIDS and undermine progress towards the 2030 Agenda. 3. The endemic vulnerabilities of SIDS linked to their unique characteristics and sensitivity to external shocks and natural hazards, for example, have now been ampli - fied by the current COVID-19 global pandemic and subsequent economic consequences. 4. The structural limitations of SIDS represent several aggravating factors and obstacles to recovery. As a 2020 OECD study demonstrates, SIDS with higher levels of GNI per capita are no longer resilient to the current crisis (Mapping the Economic Consequences of COVID-19 in Small Island Developing States\" OECD, 2020). Lessons from the 2008 financial and economic crisis point to a slower socio-economic recovery in SIDS, compared to the global level. Whatever the level of growth achieved, whatever development gains achieved, the sustainable development pathways of SIDS will always be relatively more volatile and fragile than average, due to their unique exogenous factors. 5. However, the extreme vulnerabilities of Small Developing Islands put the leaders of SIDS countries and their determination at the forefront to turn their unique challenges into opportunities, to accelerate the trans- formative sustainable development of SIDS. 6. Despite these vulnerabilities, SIDS are leading by example in several areas. As stated in our respective VNRs, our six countries have achieved, in their own way and through their own route, remarkable results in our progress towards the SDGs, despite the parallel crises - health, economic, climate, natural-biodiversity and pollution, that we continue to experience, even in the context of COVID-19. 7. In the SAMOA Pathway, together with the other SIDS, \"we reaffirm our commit - ment to taking urgent and concrete steps to address the vulnerability of Small Island Developing States, including through the sustained implementation of the Barba - dos Program of Action and the Mauritius Strategy, and underscore the urgency to find additional solutions to the major chal - lenges faced by small island developing States, in a concerted manner, in order to support them in sustaining the momentum achieving in the implementation of the SAMOA Pathway. With renewed political will and strong leadership, we are dedi - cated to work in meaningful partnership with all stakeholders at all levels.\" 8. Given these perspectives, this joint sec - tion reflected in the six SIDS VNRs for 2021, is taking stock and summarizing the main challenges / vulnerabilities and opportunities / common best practices, reported by those six countries, in accordance with the SAMOA Pathway. 9. As reflected in our six VNRs for 2021, we, SIDS, are dealing with competing priorities in the face of pandemic-induced crisis, climate change, and other exogenous factors. Parallel crises expose our collective vulnerability. Due to the scale and complexity of our unique challenges, a wide range of local, national and regional actors from our countries have 154 joined forces to produce significant sustain - able development outcomes, as highlighted in our different VNRs. 10. Despite the disproportionate vulnera - bilities we face, we have demonstrated global leadership and pioneered innovative solutions through partnerships. Strategic partnerships for integrated approaches and innovative solu - tions are more than ever needed to support our leadership in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. COVID-19 amplified the need for unprecedented collaboration to build better, greener and bluer again. With necessity being the mother of innovation, the recovery of COVID-19 represents a unique opportu- nity to catalyze transformative sustainable development.11. From these perspectives, and to echo the 2019 Interim Review of the SAMOA Path- way, we call for \"escalation and development of genuine and lasting partnerships with all stakeholders nationally, regionally and internationally\". SIDS are poles of innova - tion and evidence shows that by turning unique vulnerabilities into opportunities, strategic partnerships can support SIDS to lead innovative solutions and accelerate the transformative sustainable development of SIDS. 12. These innovative solutions and trans - formative path to sustainable development will need to be fueled by public and private investments that require better access to development finance, increased investments for economic growth and diversification, including in ocean-based economies and Creative and cultural industries, to reduce vulnerability and build resilience. 13. At a time when challenges become increasingly intertwined and exacerbated by multiple crises occurring in parallel, the multifaceted vulnerabilities common to SIDS can be turned into shared integrated solu - tions and opportunities. Thus, we commit to improve inter-regional and intra-regional cooperation and collaboration among us as Small Island Developing States, to drive sus - tainable development at scale and accelerate the achievements of the SDGs. The challenges for the Decade of Action seen by Cabo Verde's munici - palities \"With regards to challenges, municipalities' financial weakness and the local level of local economic growth are the main obstacles to the implementation of the SDGs, as is the insufficient quantity of qualified human resources. Another obstacle identified by the municipalities for the effective and timely participation of a large number of local actors is, in particular, the feeble involve - ment of the private sector, even though the current legal framework foresees the principle of public-private partnerships (PPPs). There is a need for the promotion of effective coordination, integration and complementarity between municipal actions, sectorial programs and projects executed by decentralized state services, institutes and public and private sector companies, given that all of the interventions by each one of these actors has an impact on the territory and on the lives of its inhabitants. Despite the existence of the PEMDS, we still see an accentuated centralization of the main public policy instruments, which has among its consequences a major financial dependency on central administration on the part of municipalities. This dependency is the result, one the one hand, of an inter - national, bilateral and multilateral public financing system highly concentrated in cen - tral state administration. Local authorities have few possibilities for direct access to public international financing sources, which conditions the autonomy of Cabo Verdean municipalities in SDG localization in accor- dance with their attributions, priorities and potentials. Another weakness identified is the absence of indicators to measure the targets, impact and progress of the SDGs in a de-aggregated manner for each municipality, thus ensuring the depth, horizontality and breadth of the SDG localization process.\" Jacinto Abreu Santos for Cities and Local Govern - ments United (CGLU), Voluntary Local Report, Cabo Verde 2021155 4. MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION The Integrated National Financing Framework, mobilization of external resources and the new paradigm of Cabo Verdean diplomacy. In Cabo Verde, the process through which partnerships and external resources are mobilized with bilateral partners and multilateral financial institutions such as development banks and development funds are led jointly by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finances. Integrated National Financing Framework Cabo Verdean authorities are developing the Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF), which is aimed at strengthening the National Planning System, aligning budgets and planning, and the creating the condi - tions for the mobilization of new flows of financing through a facilitating ecosystem. The INFF will accelerate the implemen - tation of the SDGs and the National and Local Development Plans through a holistic reform process involving all relevant local, national and international actors in order to optimize existing flows of public and private financing, mobilize new sources and financing and channel them into the sectors, areas and populations that most need them. Mobilization of external resources Debt Pardon The COVID-129 pandemic and Cabo Verde Ambition 2030 resulted in structural changes and priorities, namely related to fighting impoverishment and ensuring health security and, especially, to the diver - sification of the economy, for which the expansion of public investment is urgent - this, within a context of over-indebtedness aggravated by the pandemic and by Cabo Verde's status as a Middle-Income Coun - try. It is, as such, vital to pardon, at least in part, Cabo Verde's foreign public debt, so that investments with transformative impacts are not put off and to avoid the blockage, if not collapse, of the State and the destruction of the dreams of the Cabo Verdean population. Since the early days of Cabo Verde's Inde- pendence, development financing has constituted one of the country's main challenges, resulting from its status as an excessively indebted lower middle-come Small Island Developing State (SIDS) facing internal and external vulnerabilities, its ter - ritorial discontinuity, the small size of its market, its vulnerability to catastrophes and, more particularly, to climate change. With a low level of domesti9c savings, a reduced financial market and a modest public financing capacity, Cabo Verde has resorted to external capital flows, namely official development assistance, conces - sional loans, foreign direct investment and remittances from \u00e9migr\u00e9s. The financing of the 2017-2021 PEDS was a major challenge and relied on a concerted internal effort, namely through the increase in domestic public revenues, the new eco - system for the financing of the economy as a facilitating mechanism of the national financial system, loans within the context of budget consolidation and foreign direct investment. 156Using the PEDS as its foundation, Cabo Verde's Roadmap for the fulfillment of the SDGs was outlined, with five catalytic areas or accelerators of sustainable development having been identified - the development of human capital, the operationalization of the potential of the blue economy, an increase in access to renewable energies, the digital economy and an increase in the added value of tourism in the real economy. Cabo Verde is one of the countries that was most negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in an economic recession of 14.8% in 2020 and a substan- tial loss in tax revenues. Nevertheless, the country managed to successfully mobilize the international community and resources to confront the crisis, and recentered its priority of the diversification of the economy, with new international anchors selected for development: the blue economy, the digital economy, the international health platform and intelligent competitive agriculture, with sustainable tourism the leading sector. It is in this context that Cabo Verde will have to conceive of and find new internal and external financing mechanisms and tools to better respond to these challenges, ensuring financial and environmental sustainability and macroeconomic stability. With regards to external financing, Cabo Verdean authorities have taken up the development of strategic and innovative approaches to guarantee new financing, including the construction of partnerships and a new paradigm of Cabo Verdean diplomacy that innovates in the area of the mobilization of external resources. Cabo Verdean authorities are committed to: Continuing to affirm and distinguish Cabo Verde in the concert of nations through its political, institutional and social stability; trust in its relationships with development partners and investors, based on predict - ability, security, coherence and consistence, as well as on the values of democracy, free - dom, respect for human rights, the rule of law and legal security and the valorization of its geostrategic and geopolitical location. Taking advantage of its specificities, namely its location, stability and trust, positioning the country as a platform for economic circulation in the Middle Atlantic and serving as a credible ally for cooperative security, with stability and trust being fundamen - tal assets for attracting investments and placing the country on ever-higher plateaus status in its cooperation relations and global partnerships. Cabo Verdean authorities have elected four strategic objectives: The consolidation of Cabo Verde's posi - tion as a useful and relevant partner in the Middle Atlantic, in the promotion and maintenance of regional and international peace and security, democracy and human rights, and in the mobilization of resources to ensure accelerated and sustainable development. 157 Promote Cabo Verde as a platform for cir - culation and the provision of high added value services in the Middle Atlantic and for the attraction of investments, skills and development of diaspora markets. Strengthen relations with traditional part - ners and build new economic partnerships. The active search for international com - mitments for the promotion of the Cabo Verdean economy and the financing of sus - tainable development within the framework of post-COVID-19 SIDS, including the issue of foreign debt relief. Cabo Verdean authorities shall promote the conditions for: Cabo Verde to continue to benefit from official development assistance and explore other public flows, such as foreign direct investment, \u00e9migr\u00e9 remittances and the increase in the mobilization of domestic resources. Continuing to improve internal financing to achieve the autonomy thereof, but, along- side this, exploring external sources and building possible partnerships. Maintaining debt sustainability through responsible loans, the use of innovative financing instruments (Diaspora Bonds, Green Climate Fund, Blue and Green Bonds and the accompaniment of Debt Crisis Resolution Initiatives (DCRI)) as part of a responsible response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These initiatives will be adopted in close collaboration with the group of SIDS with which Cabo Verde will work in concertation for the de facto recognition of differential and institutional treatment and the recognition of a \"Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI)\" as a criterion of eligibility for access to financing. Alongside this, reinforcing the continuous work of promoting the country abroad through active diplomacy in order to attract FDI, and strengthening ties to the Cabo Verdean diaspora so that it may participate and invest in its home country. Strengthening traditional bilateral part - nerships and building new strategic part - nerships with countries and international institutions from a win-win perspective. In this sense, we will resume the holding of general and sectorial or private invest - ment theme-based \"Round Table\" sessions, we will promote and multiply exploratory economic prospection missions, holding bilateral statutory meetings such as the \"dialogue and partnership commissions,\" and monitor announcements and responses for calls for proposals that Cabo Verde is eligible for. Promoting Cabo Verde abroad and attracting investment as the main mission of our Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts, whose employees will be called upon to play the role of veritable agents in economic diplomacy to the service of the country. Developing the planning and strategy of financing and diplomacy for the mobilization of external resources, all the while using the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) as a reference, developing national financing 158namely through the Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF). Develop a national information, monitoring and evaluation system of the sustainable development goals as an important support structure to the financing strategy. Promoting Cabo Verdean diplomacy as a privileged foreign policy tool that can make use of all its aspects and capacities to defend these national objectives. Developing a Cabo Verdean diplomatic corps attentive to Cabo Verde's condition as a SIDS, with strategic and innovative approaches to guarantee new financing and consolidate partnerships for the country to attain the goals of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Adopting political, economic and develop - mental, security-related and cultural diplo -macy at the service of Cabo Verdean \u00e9migr\u00e9 communities - in other words, an innova - tive type of diplomacy that enhances Cabo Verde's position as a credible, safe and useful partner in the Middle Atlantic at the service of the 2030 Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda, a type of diplomacy that upgrades the country's relations of cooperation and global partnerships, promoting national economic interests and mobilizing external resources for the financing of its sustainable development. Given Cabo Verde's condition as a nation with a large diaspora with a strong, rich and diversified set of technical, scientific, research-related, economic, financial, entrepreneurial, cultural and sports capac - ities and skills, Cabo Verdean authorities will promote the active involvement and aggregation of the willingness of our vast \u00e9migr\u00e9 community to help materialize the strategic objectives of Cabo Verde's Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda. Group action within the scope of SIDS The economic losses experienced by the SIDS, including in domestic revenues and because of the slow recovery process, have compromised the continuity of national development financing efforts under the terms of the Addis Ababa Action Plan (AAAA). The need to better consider the Vulnerability Profile as a specific criterion for these States, which are subject to catastrophes and more vulnerable to climate change, is even more stark now, with regards to access to official development assistance and concessional financing, as well as the creation of a SIDS Compact as a mechanism of excellence for the financing of sustainable recovery. Cabo Verdean authorities propose promoting the construction of an international commitment on \"Post-COVID-19 economic recovery and the financing of sustainable development in the SIDS\" along with the other SIDS and with the support of the United Nations and other development partners. 159 5. NEXT STEPS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SDGS IN CABO VERDE We successfully held Cabo Verde Ambition 2030, mobilizing Cabo Verdean society, the diaspora, municipal governments, the business sector, public administration, academia, the media, development part - ners and personalities and institiuons with an interest in Cabo Verde. We lent high visibility to the country and deepended its notereity and credibility, created con- ditions for strategic choices and firmed up long-term commitments to Cabo Verde's sustainable development. We promoted the alignment of the main actors in the realm of sustainable development along the main strategic guidelines, adopted the SDG accelerators and elaborated the Cabo Verde Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda. The Cabo Verde Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda is an overarching tool for the alignment of political subjects and social actors to be used as the basis for future national, sectorial, municipal and regional strategic plans, but is, especially, a long-term reference instrument for the State, the private sector, civil society and development partners, and, as such, sup - ports strategic dialogue for the sustainable development of Cabo Verde. It is our ambition, on the 2030 horizon, to make Cabo Verde a consolidated, modern and inclusive democracy, a blue, digitalized, emerging and resilient nation, an economy of circulation located in the Middle Atlantic, a member of ECOWAS with full employment and shared prosperity, a country useful to the world and a source of pride for all. We are preserving systems and must not permit the prolonged stagnation of most productive activity, protecting the net- work of relations between workers and employers, producers and consumers, sup - pliers and clients and creditors and debtors so that business may resume quickly in the post-health emergency period. Aware of the fact that tourism has the capacity to recover and directly spur the recovery of other sectors and, through its multiplying effect, the recovery of the economy and job creation. With the COVID- 29 pandemic, the health security variable was added to the tourism policy equation, requiring a reformulation of our actions. To this effect, we are enhancing tourism-sec - tor actors with quality services, both by adopting health safety standards, proto - cols and rules and by qualifying the health system's services for the resumption of tourism, thus guaranteeing the conditions for an effective return to normalcy in 2022. The economic emergency is an imperative, which is why we are maintaining the eco- nomic and social recovery agenda aimed at the resumption of business activities - in other words, the package of extraordinary measures to support the resumption and relaunching of companies' business, with a special focus on those sectors most affected by the pandemic so that they may survive and benefit from technical and financial support in their quest to join the new normal. 160The social emergency must stand at the center of short-term priorities, which is why, in this scope, we have proposed the implementation of an inclusion program geared toward empowering poor house - holds, taking on the commitment of the eradication of extreme poverty by 2026 and, in general, the eradication of absolute poverty in 2030. For this to happen, Cabo Verdean authorities, in partnership with the United Nations, is elaborating a 2021-2022 Eco- nomic Response, Recovery and Promotion Plan and a 2021-2022 Social Development Response, Recovery and Promotion Plan. In the realm of and in accordance with the guidelines of the National Employment and Training Council, the National Employ - ment Plan is being adapted to deal with the situation created by COVID within the scope of an activity being led by the ILO, in alignment with the PEDAS and the SDGs. In the second semester of the year, we will promote negotiations aimed at restructuring, at least in part, Cabo Verde's foreign debt in order to make the expansion of public investment viable in the face of the changes and priorities that emerged out of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Cabo Verde 2030 Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda - in other words, structural priorities related to the fight against poverty and to health security, housing security, water and sanitation, urban requalification and, especially, the diversification of the economy. In the second semester of the year we will conclude the setup and begin effective implementation of the Integrated National Financing Framework. Along with the other SIDS and with the sup - port of the United Nations and other devel - opment partners, Cabo Verdean authorities will promote the building of an international commitment on \"Post-COVID-19 economic recovery and the financing of sustainable development in the SIDS.\" In the second semester of this year we will elaborate the Matrix for the Con - vergence of Municipalities around the SDGs, establishing convergence targets, the differentiated situation and effort of municipalities toward convergence and the public policies of positive discrimination aimed at promoting local economies and correcting current asymmetries in human capital, financial resources and economic and social opportunities. In the second semester of this year we will begin the process of the elaboration of the 2022-2026 PEDS which will take on the actions of the recovery plans fore - seen for 2022, will integrate the national commitments of the Municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans, and will have as its essential references the 10th legislature Government Program and the Cabo Verde 2030 Strategic Sustainable Development Agenda. With the conclusion of the 2022-2026 PEDS, we will develop the sectorial stra - tegic plans, consolidate the new Monitoring and Evaluation System and develop the new resource mobilization strategy and the new paradigm of Cabo Verdean diplomacy. Cabo Verdean authorities will create a Cen - ter of Intelligence and Public Policies that will lend dynamism to analyses and studies aimed at supporting sustainable develop - ment and will take on Cabo Verde Ambition 2030 as a permanent forum, as well as create a new information system for sustainable development and develop annual public policy catalogues. It will also optimize the coordination of economic and social policies, as well as of national, sectorial and municipal sustainable development plans. 161 STATISTICAL ANNEXES \u00bb6.8 15.3 2.2 7.4 3.6 1.456.36.31.0 2030 163 "}
