Both Naturopaths and Medical Herbalists are trained to offer supportive holistic care. This means treating the person as a whole (mind, body and emotions), rather than only addressing the condition or symptoms that they are experiencing. Medical Herbalists are trained in using plant-based medicines as their main modality. Naturopaths may be trained in a number of complementary medicine modalities, including nutrition, medical herbalism, homeopathy and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Why choose a Registered Naturopath or Medical Herbalist? Currently Naturopaths and Medical Herbalists are not legislated in New Zealand. This means that anyone can call themselves a Naturopath and/or Medical Herbalist regardless of the level of training they have received. There are two associations that self-govern Naturopaths and Medical Herbalists operating in New Zealand: By choosing a Naturopath and/or Medical Herbalist registered with either of these associations, you can be assured that you are working with a qualified practitioner. Registered Naturopaths and Medical Herbalists are educated to the best standards and continuously update their education, ensuring that you receive safe health care advice backed by evidence-based research.
