III THE ANNUAI NIMBIN MARDI GRASS STREET PARADE AND DRUG lAW REFORM RALlY This year's parade is on Sunday May 4th, and it would definitely be fitting, as part of OHGA's 10th anniversary celebrations, to take part with a float. We have quite a few members in and around Nimbin and all over the area who might be interested in getting together and organising one, I'm sure. What we need: - truck, large or small sign writer(s) - other artists or artistic people with fun ideas - float manager and float participants - herbs - lots of good humor Call me with your ideas soonest!! - Elle, on 291057 on the weekend of April 5-6, at Clunes We'll teach you: *Soil testing and preparation *seed raising and propagation *wIat herbs are profitable and how, when and where to grow them *ho w much money you can earn and other money matters *companion planting and organic techniques *which herbs are required by Herb Farms Australia and the Koala Tea Company *about culinary and medicinal herbs * how to go about finding your own markets *what you can do with your herbs for your family or to make your own product *and anything else you want to know about herbs. Cost: $125. This includes a set of grower notes Bookings (with a deposit of spending cuts to your departments and you are also forced onto the land. Thatil be a a just reward. You'll wish that you had a technical liaison person .o talk to then. Respectfully yours, I-Toward Rubin, President. And an answer on January 14: Last year OHGA applied to the Rural Industry Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC) for a grant to fund a technical liaison officer who would assist people with enquiries re herbgrowing, set up an Internet site etc. We were, again, knocked back by the bureaucrats. Upon hearing this, Howard wrote them the following letter: 24 December 96 Dear Mr. Core, We are today in receipt of the RIRDC funding decision (ref: NPP97-03) in which our association was not selected for funding. Of course, we do not accept your decision. One of the comments was that we are not aware of other RIRDC funded projects. But here I must say that it is you who are not really aware of these projects, as we are constantly asked for advice from these people. When was the last time you actually stepped on the soil of these projects and looked at what they are doing? My guess is never. Because if you had, you would see what a waste of money these projects are. You have people going round in circles, duplicating the real work of others and submitting reports to your bureaucracy. While the real work, the real pioneers of this industry are overlooked. The Organic Herb Growers of Australia has been an industry association for ten years, without a penny of government funding. We are the only body to represent herb growers at a ministerial level, with a seat on the OPAC Board; fully accredited by AQIS as a organic certification body. Our association represents over 350 growers nationwide. No other herb industry body can make those claims! To say that our project of appointing a technical liaison officer is of no economic benefit of a national value is a disgrace. Do you really know how many growers there are who have absolutely no idea of how to maintain a fully operational herb farm... from seed to sale. Obviously not. And where are they going to get this information.., from one of your other projects? What a laugh. If you ring up any of the other projects, and believe me we have all of them, usually to answer their questions,they will not divulge any information. Most probably because they don't have any. Or else they plan to corn mer- cialise it at an exorbitant charge after we the tax- payers have paid for their learning curve. What a joke. Let us hope that the new year brings with it Dear Mr Rubin, I wish to respond to your letter of 24 December 1996 regarding the Corporation's decision not to support your proposal. First of all, let me point out that the Corporation's response did not say that your proposal would not confer economic benefits of national value. Rather, it noted that your proposal did-not provide informa- tion that would allow the hbped for economic bene- fits to be compared with those claimed in the other 58 applications for funding from the New Plants Program. Similarly, the proposal did not refer to other RIRDC herb-related work and show how your proposal would build on or complement such activities. The Corporation has supported a number of herb- related activities including an \"industry prospects\" study by Ian Hemphill, industry workshops in Mt Macedon and Tocal and substantial industry establishment R&D projects in Northern NSW, WA and Queensland. It has also funded a more generic project on post harvest handling and packaging. Medicinal herbs have also been supported through our Essential Oils and Plant Extracts program. Your view that such activities are worthless is debatable to say the least. With respect, I would suggest that a more produc- tive way of addressing your concerns about the al- location of research funds would be to coordinate the industry as a whole in providing the Corpora- tion with a nationally relevant and industry-endor- sed list of research needs and priorities for the herb industry. This is particularly needed for culinary herbs now that the proposed establishment of a R&D levy appears to have collapsed and now that it would appear that RIRDC will continue to be the major source of government R&D funds for your industry. The Mt Macedon workshop, in which you parti- cipated, provided a list of 16 items potentially war- ranting R&D but recognised that further consul- tation was necessary to identify areas for funding. To the best of our knowledge this consultation has not taken place so why not revisit the scene and provide us with advice that will guide our invest- ment in herbs for the next three years or so? A copy of our R&D plan for Essential Oils and Plants is provided to show how we address planning and resource allocation. The Program Manager Dr David Evans would be pleased to assist you and can be contacted on 06 272 5472. Yours sincerely, Peter Core, Managing Director. E] 5 Tihancing Soil Ecot L_by Barb Knudsen IF we were to look at the living soil ecosystems that surround us, especially in undisturbed areas of nature, we would get a pretty good idea of what the local soil ecology should look like. Its always a good idea to actually get your hands dirty in the process. In this way you will come to appreciate the myriad little creatures at work at the soil surface and below. Depending on what species of herbs you are growing, try to locate similar sort of environments as they are native to, and observe what happens there. How can you recreate those conditions under which your species thrives best? For example, the Mediterranean herbs such as rosemary, thyme and oregano love hot, dry, alkaline soil and rocky places. Herbs that are more lush may like some shade. So create microclimates by using trees,rocks, swales/ terraces, taller plants, ground cover plants etc. 1. PLANT LAYERS In Permaculture, we talk about using plant layers as a way of recreating a forest situation. While this may be highly pro- ductive and involves a great number of species all growing at differing heights, it is not necessarily what we want in a herb production area. You can increase your microclimates,thus altering climate and increasing moisture holding capacity, by planting trees on the borders of your production area - or intercrop them between rows. This Agroforestry or Herbfores try can create an additional income, act as a windbreak, climate modification, and if you use a deciduous species, it can act as a self mulching system below it. Deep rooted tree species are best where possible, to reduce the amount of nutrient competition with your crop. Also recommended is the use of Nitrogen fixing species like Acacia sp. which can be managed to release Nitrogen at the soil level. Benefits: creating microclimate control increasing soil moisture by providing shade windbreak decreasing evaporation from soil mulch source release of Nitrogen into soil 2. WORMS The little wrigglies are great for creating organic matter. But, worms need food in order to create this organic matter. if you generally tend to mulch your entire crop, this will provide good conditions for worms to thrive in. Worms need moist conditions in order to survive. One way to increase your number of worms on a large scale: Find an area in your garden where there is a good population of worms established. Dig up a 1.5ft.sq. piece of that ground. Take the chunk of ground full of worms and transfer it to a site barren of worms. Sprinkle lime or dolomite and place worm chunk upside down on the barren ground. The worms should slowly make their way down into the new ground with a little bit of zrass or weeds to chew on, on the way down. Worms can also be grown in styrofoam boxes for smaller applications. First buy a thousand worms Then place them in a styrofoam box with no holes Add kitchen scraps or cow manure until the box is filled Then add a second box (with holes in bottom) on top and start filling the new box with kitchenscraps and manure Soon the worms will find their way into the new box Keep adding new boxes as needed, always waiting until the worms have all vacated the box below before you harvest the castings. 3. MULCHING AND SHEET MULCHING Mulching is pretty much a must in the subtropical and drier climates. By keeping the soil moister, the microbes remain active, thus increasing the organic matter. In really weedy areas, its a good idea to lay down a layer of cardboard or newspaper first before the hay/straw mulch. Let this have time (6 weeks) to shade out and kill the weeds underneath before poking holes through the newspaper and planting. Sheet Mulch Spread chook p00/blood and bone, or any high Nitrogen fertiliser on surface of area/lawn you wish to mulch Place one good layer of cardboard or newspaper on top (hint - these are easier to work with when they're wet) Cover with a layer of veggie/kitchen scraps Then a layer of straw or hay Cover with another layer of garden clippings or green compost A layer of manure And one final layer of straw Sprinkle with dolomite/lime and water thoroughly Sheet Mulch can be covered and left to rot down for several weeks. ** When planting into sheet mulch garden, remember to always place a shovelful of soil into the depression made for each seedling, and draw straw back over to base of plant after planting - this ensures that the seedling won't dry out and/or gets burned by any manure not com- pletely broken down. 4. PLANT FERTILISERS You can make your own fertilisers using plants from the garden. Most plants accumulate specific nutrients eg. Bracken is high in Potassium, Stinging nettle is a good Nitrogen source, Beetroot leaves are high in Boron. By making your own home brew from plants, you increase fertility in the soil and use your own resources rather than external ones. Comfrey as a deep rooted plant accumulates many elements from the subsoil, which can then be used to fertilise your plants. Comfrey Tea I. Fill a bucket 3/4 full with comfrey leaves Fill the bucket with water Cover and let sit in a sunny place for 2-3 weeks in summer, longer in winter Dilute the tea 1:1 water to Comfrey tea before applying to root zone of crop. TRACE ELEMENTS Most trace elements or micronutrients can be increased by the use of rock dust, animal manures or plant fertilisers. Don't be fooled by the chemical companies - NPK is not all that is needed to grow plants! Rock dust is probably the easiest way to ensure that trace elements are present. A local source is usually available from groovy organic nursery people etc. GREEN MANURES AND COVER CROPS Green manures are Nitrogen-fixing crops which are cultivated in production areas where increased soil fertility is desired. Legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen on their roots when they grow together with specific bacteria called Rhizobia. When you purchase the seed that you want, you can usually also purchase the specific bacteria inoculant at the same outlet. Unless that crop has been grown in the intended site before, you will need some inoculant. The nitrogen nodules, formed on the roots, are released into the nearby soil when the plant dies or is tilled into the soil. They can also be slashed back and mulched over, if you are a die hard no till person like me. It really depends on how much land you are green manuring. Green Manuring Choose a green manure crop suitable for the season you want to plant it in. Refer to HERB GROWER issue Nov/Dec '94 Green Manure chart, or talk to your local farm supply dealer. Make sure to acquire the inoculant needed. Rake or lightly harrow the surface intended to plant. Broadcast the inoculated seed over the surface and rake in. Best to do this before a rain if possible. Wait until the plant has grown, but not gone to seed (5-6 weeks). Till crop into the soil or slash and mulch. 11-71-11, Wait approximately 4 weeks for the crop to break down before planting. Benefits include: - the improving of the soil structure through extensive root systems of some species, which break down and create humus and pore spaces; - suppression of weeds due to competition and shading; - increased organic matter in the soil; - increased nitrogen and trace elements in the soil; - increasing soil microbial populations. Cover Crops These are crops which are established in currently non productive areas - under fruit trees, under windbreaks, pathways etc. Instead of having lawn or weeds, you can grow clovers, medics, lucerne, or maku lotus which increase nitrogen, protect the soil from erosion and can provide bees with nectar. Cover crops are established in the same way as green manures, only they are left in place. To keep a year round cover crop going in any given area, it's a good idea to establish summer and winter varieties.

The important thing to remember with compost is to get the Carbon-Nitrogen ratio correct (25:1). Holy cow, that's a lot of carbon! It seems like it, but if you only used kitchen scraps and manure, you would have a slimy anaerobic mess in no time. And remember, the pile must be moist to work. You can turn it to aerate if you like. Carbon materials: sawdust dry leaves hay / straw sawdust branches. Nitrogen materials: kitchen scraps manure (chook, cow, pig, horse, duck etc.) green plant cuttings (eg. comfrey leaves) hair urine. As composting is a technique that can usually only be used for small scale soil building, I've kept this simple. There are many good books on composti ng. S. BIODYNAMICS A form of organic agriculture developed by Rudolf Steiner in the 1920's, Biodynamics uses preparations that increase the life force of soil and plants. The most famous preparation of biodynamics is preparation 500. In brief, this preparation can be applied to any broadscale or small scale production and will increase the soil microbial activity - thus increasing the organic matter in the soil and ultimately creating healthier plants and increased crop productivity. To obtain preparation 500 and more information on biodymanics, contact: Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association of Australia (B.D.F.G.A.A.), P 0 Box 54, Bellingen NSW 2454. All soil types can be improved by the addition of organic matter. Whenever I think about growing quality plants, I think primarily of healthy balanced soil. The more balanced and vibrant our soils are, the healthier we will be, the higher the quality will be in the plants we are growing. Good luck growing your soil.

You will, of course, prepare good beds for these crops. They like a light, well dug spot and don't like fresh manure or fertilisers in the soil. If your soil is heavy-ish, you must dig in some compost or, if you're short on that commodity, gypsum or a bit of sand to lighten it up. If you haven't been able to fertilise the soil previously, place a layer of comfrey leaves on the bed under the top mulch. You can also plant and propagate trees now, and shrubs and most herbs during this week. You may want to consider planting a patch with the special compost activator herbs chamomile, yarrow, horsetail, stinging nettle and valerian. some comfrey, for liquid manure and a nourishing mulch (I also use pounded leaves as a compress on bad bruises and sore back. Works great!). Or you may want to assemble an insect repellent area, with pyrethrum, wormwood, rhubarb, garlic, chillies and rue, all of which are good general insect repellents. Pyrethrum is the deadliest of them, with rhubarb (leaves) a close second. A loose rule for making insect sprays is to pick a large bunch of leaves, boil it up in a large pot and let sit for at least half an hour. Strain and dilute 1:4 with water. Add a little liquid soap for stickiness. Garlic and chilies can be minced in a food processor with water, diluted 1:4 and sprayed, again with a little soap added. APRIL 1 Last Quarter. 2-6 Days for general garden care. You may have garden beds that are finished producing and for which you have no immediate plans. This is the ideal time to lay them to rest, to let them recuperate. What I do: I cover them with either lots of comfrey leaves, kitchen scraps, reject Koala Tea bags, or dolomite and Orga- nic Life, water them well and cover them with card board or a thick layer of newspapers. I water them again and cover with thick hay or straw and give the whole lot another good watering. A few months later I'm guaranteed to have a rich bed, ready for new sowings or plantings. You don't have to weed either before you treat your soil to its beauty sleep. 7 New Moon. 8-14 A week to plant and sow leafy annuals: chervil, coriander, dill, anise, borage, cumin, lettuce, cabbage, silverbeet, endive, parsley, etc. All annuals, being required to grow, mature and produce in a short period of time, need a good soil and regular feeding. Weekly watering with comfrey manure or a seaweed fertiliser will be necessary and appreciated. 15 First Quarter. 16-22 Time to sow or plant flowering and seed bearing annuals: all sorts of hollyhocks, cumin, anise, dill, borage, caraway, and vegies such as peas, beans, broad beans, broccoli and cauliflowers. 23 Full Moon. 24-29 Days for planting or propagating root crops and perennials. Most herbs can now go in: Mediterraneans like rosemary, oregano, sage and thyme; lavenders can be planted, and mint, lawn chamomile, yarrow, valerian, lemon balm etc. etc. A good time to start that 113 111 herbal lawn you've wanted for a while. You could include creeping thyme, yarrow, salad parsnips and other root vegies can be sown, and trees and shrubs planted, or moved to another spot in your garden. 30 Last Quarter. MAY 1-6 Days for general garden work. This would be a good time to fill up your wheelbarrow with rockdust and spread it on beds, under trees and shrubs. In our garden we do this once a year and it really makes a difference. It works its way into the soil, where it slowly releases its minerals. Rockdust also keeps the soil warmer in winter. 7 New Moon. 8-13 Time to plant and sow leafy annuals: cabbage, parsley, lettuce, spinach, coriander, dill and try growing some endive. It's a chicory, and a staple Dutch winter vegetable. I'll give you the recipe for a yummy endive dish: peel, boil and mash potatoes. Pull up a good plant of endive, wash it well and cut into one inch strips; mix it raw into the mashed potatoes, add salt and pepper, some milk or soymilk and a good dash of vinegar. Vegetarians will want to add some soysauce too, but meat eaters could fry up some strips of bacon and add that, and the fat, to the pot. Simmer a minute or so to warm up the endive, stirring with a wooden spoon to prevent burning. Tastes delicious! 14 First Quarter. groups throughout the Asia Pacific region have joined together in a campaign to promote healthful, safe, locally grown food. The Safe Food Campaign, coordinated by the Pesticide Action Network Asia and the Pacific (PAN AP), supports sustainable agriculture practices, which preclude the use of chemical inputs, as the way towards a safe and secure food supply. Sarojeni V. Rengam, PAN AP director, stated: \"We are launching this joint campaign not only to call for production and availability of food that is nutritious and safe for human consumption, but also to protect the health and livelihoods of the producers of our food -- our farmers, especially women farmers, fisherfoiks, indigenous communities and our workers.\" Activities are being held throughout the region by partner groups in Malaysia, Indonesia, India New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Eating food that is locally grown is a key aspect of the Safe Food Campaign. Strengthening rural and indigenous sectors by creating demand for safely produced local foods would foster a more just, equitable and sustainable relationship between consumers and producers, and could possibly turn the tide on problems of food security. Highlighting the crucial role women play in ensuring food security is also an important part of the campaign. In Asia, women perform over 50% of the labour involved in intensive rice cultivation. Women also have much of the responsibility for, and knowledge of, sustainable agriculture systems, and they play a key role in preserving and utilising biodiversity. A range of activities were held throughout the region to launch the campaign in each country. In Malaysia, PAN AP collaborated with local groups on a Seminar of Safe Food, exhibitions on local fruits and dangers of pesticides, and a Malay style feast featuring local foods. In New Zealand, a coalition of seven groups organised a \"Safe Food Day\", and called for a nationwide boycott of the country's \"dirty dozen\" foods, the 12 foods most highly contaminated with pesticide residues. Fifteen organisations came together in Sri Lanka for a march and rally, which included street theatre entitled: \"Pesticides and Death\". In Indonesia, events have been taking place around the country to promote biodynamic and organic farming, and to raise public awareness about residues of \"Dirty Dozen\" pesticides on food. In India, the Pesticide Free Community Vegetable Production Program began in September 1996 and involves over 100 farmers who grow produce that is sold directly to 300 families in local communities. In December, the India Rural Reconstruction and Disaster Response Service (PREPARE) organised a rally attended by thousands of coastal fisherfolk and agricultural workers in Andhra Pradesh to demand safe food and protection of marine food. -Pesticide Monitor, Volume 5, December 1996, PANNA.

I don't remember if it was a kitten, a puppy or a joey. I've had all three. Mind you, they all had the same \"instructions tag\" attached. There were rules on how to feed them, how to pick them up, how to train them, how to put the joey in the bag hanging over the back of a chair in front of the wood stove at night. (In fact, one of our joeys took to reclining in the open warming oven at the bottom of the stove - much to the amuse- ment of all but the cook). This process of \"taming\" an animal (or any- thing else) requires the development of trust between the tamer and the tamee. In the old days, procuring a new horse involved throwing a rope around its neck, short-tying it to a post, fitting it with a bridle and saddle and letting it out in a small paddock to eat, drink and buck for 24 hours wearing all the tackle. The next day, someone got on it and kept riding until the horse was so exhausted it could resist no longer. Hardly trust building! And probably explained why most of them turned into \"outlaws\" when they came back from the spell paddock. Then along came the Jeffrey's Method of horse-breaking which used a gentle, quiet approach, acknowledged the high level of intelligence of the animal and resulted in a working relationship built on mutual respect. When we moved onto the farm, one of our first visitors was a female pretty-face wallaby (or are they rufous wallabies in the iiggi?). We named her Ruby (her initial name was Roo) and her joey became Josephine. We were SO grateful this wild animal had come to keep us company, we started putting out a small bowl of oats which Ruby took to like a duck to water. A month or two later, a stranger appeared along with Ruby and Jo. A male. Obviously the boyfriend so he became known as Beau. We told him apart because he was a darker red and had a small nick out of his left ear. (Later, a new female showed up with a similar ear-nick and was promptly dubbed Nikki.) By this time, our wallaby family numl3ered about nine males, females and joeys who ate with us every morning and evening. They had THE LIFE OF RILEY realised we posed no threat to them, that we provided a bit of extra grain protein and that we became an enraptured audience when they showed off their ability to have family squab- bles over dinner or when they let a new joey out of the pouch for its first, gangly hop and stumble around the paddock. Then the old habit of taming came into play. \"Why not teach them to feed out of my hand?\" I thought. It's easy. Reward training. Bring the grain bowl closer to the house every day till they eat out of it while I am holding it. Provided we respect and trust each other neither of us could suffer. Except? Except there are some subtle drawbacks associated with taming animals - more so the wild than the domestic. There is a tendency to provide them with the wrong food. We innocently started feeding oats to the wallabies as we were using the seed for green manure crops. Fortunately, an expert advised us sorghum/millet was better as it did not stick in their gums. There is also the fear that they will build up too much trust in humans. Hand feeding is fine . . . provided it is my hand. But what if they hopped into another valley, onto a strange farm and approached another person for a handful of oats? Few people shoot the local wallabies now. But a few still might if one was close enough or the dog biscuits had run out. Our feeding bowls are now a respectful viewing distance away. Humans like taming things. They tame animals, land, rivers and forests. Even each other. But it is seldom done with much trust or respect. And we wonder why we are not very successful at it. - Kenrick Riley 1-73 11 VICMI IJ NATURAL HUMATE FERTILIZERS Making what is , naturally best for your soils, plants and animals jPhone VICMILL Agent Stephen Whitsed information VICMILL is BFA and NASAA certified is granulated is great on Pastures, Fruit Orchar , Vegetables, Vineyards and Herbs SYA\\Y4B1THPEWS] TRIII4T CARRYING YOUR FRESH HERBS AND OTHER PRODUCE DAILY To CAPITAL CITY MARKETS REFRIGERATED RELIABLE ISERS A RICH BLEND OF COMPOSTED POULTRY MANURE, BLOOD & BONE, FISH MEAL AND SEAWEED I, PHONE 1800 818 482 FOR YOUR LOCAL DEALER 14EPE AND TIMBEP OPYING Drying facilities available in the Western District - Ararat are Very reasonable rates Phone RMB 662 Willaura 3379 firazilians Sing Praise of Miracle Cure A remarkable herb used as a cure-all by residents of a small town in northern Brazil has turned out to be marijuana. For years, people in Cruzeta, Rio Grande do Norte state, swore by the properties of what they called 'liamba\". But then a police officer grew suspicious about the true identity of the spindly, green weed and ordered tests. \"If you've got a wheezing throat, it'll put you right straight away,\" sais Marta Medeiros, recommending a potion made from her backyard marijuana for toothache and head pains. Miguel Matias said he took a tea made from the plant as a pick-me-up. I've already had two and I'm going to have another three, to keep me young\", said the pensioner. A local judge took a dim view of the use of the herb, which is being investigated by police. 'The residents could be arrested\" he said. - Reuters, Sept 2, 1996 (Internet) Rosemary Makes a Good Topiary 1 It's easy to shape rosemary by training it on a wire frame. Visit a garden centre that carries ready-made topiary wire frames and choose from the many shapes and sizes - from traditional cone shapes to spheres. Rosemary may be upright or prostate in growing habit, so if you wish to train your plant into a pyramidal form, or in successive spheres taller than 1 or 2 feet, you!l need the upright type. For best results, grow your rosemary in a well-draining, gritty potting soil. This herb likes lime, so crush eggshells with water, and apply occasionally. Place the frame in the pot, pushing the wire ends into the soil. If you are training the rosemary to grow on a circular form, tie the ends of new shoots to the wire as they grow. Once the form is covered, trim stray new shoots to keep the topiary tidy. If you use a cone form, simply allow the plant to grow and fill the cone, pinching the tips to encourage bushiness. Once the plant has filled the interior of the cone, snip the rosemary almost flush with the form to maintain the pyramidal shape. To coax your rosemary into a standard, a shape that resembles a small tree, select a strong, straight shoot that can be trained as a central leader. Insert a narrow stake next to the stem and tie the stem to the stake as it grows upward. - New York Times, 14 Nov. 1996 (Internet) Making Your Own Herb and Flower Waters Ingredients: 1/2 litre mineral, distilled or boiled water 60 ml vodka 6-8 drops essential oil 2 cups dried herbs or flower petals Method one: Put essential oil and vodka in the bottom of a glass bottle and shake vigorously to dissolve oil Add water and shake to blend thoroughly Let mixture sit for several days before use to age the scent particularly if a blend of oils has been used.

Not only are these sea vegetables used as fertilisers on organic farms, but there are many varieties and brands sold in healthfood shops, most of them imported from Japan and other Asian countries, and sold as super healthy' vegetables. Seaweeds are also an integral part of the macrobiotic diet. Kelp is widely marketed too, either as a single ingredient tablet or powder, or as part of slimming preparations and other formulas. How safe is seaweed these days? Not very, it seems, at least not in our oceans. Jeff and Kathryn, organic growers who run a 4ha property in the Deua River valley some 300km south of Sydney, had the dream of producing and marketing Australia's first certified wild-harvest organic seaweed product for human consumption. The seaweed, phyllosphora, and a kelp, Ekonia, were to be collected from the seemingly pristine beaches in their locality. In their two years of research and development (and expenditure of considerable funds), they had checked with local government authorities in the region and had found that all effluent in the area is treated to drinkable standard. There are, or had been in the past, no heavy industries in the area. Most of the land is wilderness of one form or another, and very sparsely populated. Market research showed excellent potential: Sydney restaurateurs would buy the seaweed as soon as it was there, and packaging was developed for sales in healthfood shops. Permits to harvest the sea greens were obtained from NSW Fisheries. As Jeff and Kathryn are long time NASAA members, they applied to the organisation for certification. This is were their dream was shattered. A condition for certification by any organisation is that the produce is free from chemical contaminants, but Jeff and Kathryn were confident this would only be a formality. Using the services of a Melbourne laboratory, they had three analyses done at three-monthly intervals in late 1995 and early 1996. The results were shattering: there were high levels of toxic heavy metals like arsenic and cadmium present, which varied, some as much as four or five times, from 14 one test to the next. Needless to say that NASAA refused certification. But what about all those seaweeds and kelps that are imported into the country? Dean McCulIum, a senior food technologist with the Australia NZ Food Authority, said the maximum permitted levels set in thV Australian Food Standards Code for the presence of arsenic and cadmium in seaweed were 1 milligram per kilo for arsenic and 0.2 milligrams per kilo for cadmium, at 85% hydration. He said that food products imported into Australia are subject to random surveillance unless a problem was identified in a particular product area, in which case it would be put on an Active Surveillance list with the result that 10% of consignments would be checked. This is an edited version of the article that appeared in ACRES AUSTRALIA 42. Does this have any repercussions for us, organic growers, who use seaweed sprays on our herbs and vegetables as fertiliser and fungicide? It is to be hoped that the treatment these sea vegetables receive to turn them into our sprays, gets rid of any contaminants. Many of them are certfied organic. -Elle Want to Know More About Permacuiture? PIJ has the solu Dedicated to practical and sustainable environmental strate- gies for Australia and the World.

Officially acknowledging last year that India's public health delivery system had failed, former health minister A.R.Antulay announced a series of policy measures to formally harness the services of India's 550,000-odd registered practitioners of Ayurveda and other traditional systems of medicine. The policy quickly took off in Kerala state where, undisturbed by foreign medicines, Ayurveda has been a continuing tradition of vaidyans (master physicians), training students and treating patients in sylvan retreats called \"ashrams\". At the Santhigiri Ashram patients, suff ring from diseases considered chronic by allopathic doctors, are routinely -' cured by ayurvedic physicians, under the supervision of their 70 year old master Guru Karunakaran. In the best tradition of Ayurveda, Guru Karu- nakaran looks for un- derlying spiritual causes for diseases such as rheumatism, diabetes, epilepsy or heart con- ditions, and may pre- scribe psychic treat- ments which would seem irrational in allo- pathy. Although the ashram is famous for its Past Life Therapy, which is free, cures are mainly effected through a wide range of herbal pal- liatives, oil massages, fomentations and s team baths, at a nominal cost. When Saraswati Amma, a 50-year old diabetic, was told that her festering foot would have to be amputated by specialists at the prestigious Trivandrum Medical College Hospital, she decided to go to Santhigiri Ashram for a second opinion. \"In fact, I was encouraged to try out the Ashram's ayurvedic hospital by the allopathic doctors and I am glad I did, Amma said. Not only did she save her foot, but the herbal cures helped control her blood sugar levels permanently. For diabetes, the main drug prescribed by physicians at the Ashram is Pancham- ridwekarasa', a pancreatic rejuvenant, the ingre- dients of which are carefully grown and tended at a herbal farm nearby. Although medicines produced at the Santhigiri Ashram include rare and valuable herbs, they are cheaply priced because they enjoy tax exemptions, says Anantha Rama Iyer, who manages the ashram's nationwide distribution network. In Kerala itself, the state government, as a special gesture, fully reimburses its employees for medicines from Santhigiri Ashram sold against prescriptions, Iyer said. After the central government announced support for the formal entry of Ayurveda into primary healthcare, especially in the poverty- ridden urual areas, Santhigiri Ashram set up a model project in Keralas hilly district of Palakkad. This area, typically, had allopathic doctors and fine diagnostic facilities concentrated in the urban areas, while people in the remote villages were left to fend for themselves. With central government funding, the 15M rupees (about A$600,000 - Elle) basic health project, emphasizing women and child care, consists of a 20-bed base hospital servicing six satellite clinics and 33 outreach centres, covering 50,000 people in a 120sq km swath. The strength of the project is the ayurvedic cures for childhood ailments and for ante- natal, natal and post - natal care based on ancient formulas which are popular with well- to-do city folk as well. According to chief physician Dr K.N. Shyam Prasad, the herbal preparations include \"Balasarvan- gam, a pediatric nerve medicine which not only works as a prophylactic against polio- myelitis, but also cures it in the early stages. \"It also works well against tetanus and convulsions and as a respiratory relaxant in asthma and whooping cough\", adds Dr Prasad, a qualified specialist in allopathic urology. The childcare plan or 'balachikitsa' begins with tests on the mother's milk, and correctives are given to her orally to prevent colic and induce immunity to various diseases in the child, project director R. Gopalakrishnan said. Oral rehydration therapy, promoted vigorously by the UNICEF and World Health Organisation as a life-saver in childhood diarrhea, is in fact described in ancient ayurvedic texts using unrefined sugar and rock- salt, or alternatively thin rice gruel, Gopala- krishnan said. Care for the new mother includes a three-month period of herbal oil massages, compresses and tonics to restore correct body weight and muscle tone. There are also herbs to deal with complications such as premature and septic abortions. The Ashram also has a line of safe herbal medicines for reproductive health and regulation of fertility which fits well into the national family planning program. For the central New Delhi government Ayurveda appears a ready-made solution to new disparities created by market reforms, which are making allopathic medicines inaccessible to the vast majority of Indians. We are rediscovering the merits of Ayurveda and its popularity with the people, Union Health Minister Salim Shervani told a meeting of state health ministers and secretaries this month, and pledged massive budgetary support to revive the system in the country's ninth five-year plan, starting this year. - Thiruvananthapurarn, India - [PS, January 22 Pleasance Herb Seeds Growers and Importers of medicinal and culinary organic herb seed McDonalds Bridge Summerland Way, NSW 2470 Ph. 018795419 1 Tonne Herb Dryer Available at $2 .50 per dried kilo, Izammermilled and packed..

The facility delivers fruit fly in their pupal stage to Lucas Heights to he irradiated at specific doses and hence flies are sterilised with minimum effect on their activities after release. After irradiation, containers of pupae are air freighted to country destinations where they are held in cages for about two days after they emerge from the pupal cases. These sterile adults are then distributed in various release strategies, with the intention to produce an overflooding ratio of 100 sterile flies to every wild fly in the environment, with the outcome that every time a wild fly mates, it invariably selects a sterile fly as a partner and that no fertile eggs are produced. That way the fruit fly cycle is broken, and the number of wild flies trapped declines in areas where releases of sterile flies are made over several months. This is of course excellent news for organic growers too. ROUNDUP RESISTANCE A northern Victorian farmer has found that annual ryegrass on his farm was not being controlled by Roundup. He noticed the annual ryegrass in one paddock was no longer susceptible to the herbicide after only 10 sprayings in the past 15 years! The glyphosate-resistant annual ryegrass is a world first and poses a grave warning to our high- technology based crop production systems which rely heavily on herbicides. - NSW Agriculture Today Dec. 1996 BRITISH ISSUE WARNING ON ALTERED CORN Genetically altered maize from the United States, which could soon he imported into Europe, could cause a potential risk to both animal and human health, Britain has warned. In an unusual move, the British Dept of the Environment (DoE), which is responsible for vetting new genetically-modified food products, expressed concerns that disease treatment in humans could he compromised by the US maize. The new corn, developed by Swiss drugs company Ciba-Geigy, contains a gene which is resistant to antibiotics. If fed raw to animals, they might no longer respond to antibiotic treatment, and in turn, a human eating the meat could also become resistant to penicillin and other such drugs. \"The health concern .... is that at some time, there could be a transfer of the antibiotically-immune bacteria from animals to humans,\" said DoE spokesman David Prior. \"When you go to the doctor for treatment you would not respond to an antibiotic.\" Britain is one of a number of European countries concerned about the modified maize, which has been developed to resist a crop-eating insect. The US has been pressuring Europe to allow the imports. The European Commission - the executive arm of the European Union - has delayed approval while three scientific committees investigated the effects of the modified corn. But British Environment Secretary John Gummer warned the Americans this week not to force their genetically-altered corn into Britain's food chain. European environment ministers meeting on Monday will consult with scientists, who are due to report on the maize, known as Genetech Corn, by the end of December. - Northern Star, 7-12-1996 CELERY'S NEXT The Northcoast of NSW Main Camp tea tree oil group is setting its sights on celery seed. The group is already engaged in multi-million dollar research work on tea tree oil and derived products at the Australian Tea Tree Oil Research Institute at Southern Cross University in Lismore, a publicly generated investment funded facility of around $60 million. The goals are to raise further capital, to undertake clinical research into the potential of compounds in celery seed as a treatment for arthritic and rheumatic problems, and to develop twenty products for the relief of arthritis. The Main Camp tea tree plantation was set up several ago. They were accused of environmental rape of the land for the manner in which they went about it and are still heavy chemical users, even though they have applied to NASAA for organic certification!

'96 BLACK TEA LOWERS RISK OF SKIN CANCER Many health conscious people have stopped drinking 'real' tea in favour of herbal teas. But CSIRO and scientists around the world have discovered what has long been known in countries like Japan and China: tea is good for processing company, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said that herb planting can significantly help boost the economic status of poor rural communities in the country. He urged local businessmen to promote the export of herbal products which, he said, have a great potential of earning hard currencies. Officials of the Herbs Production and Processing Company said the company, the first of its kind in the country, is now producing, processing and exporting herb products worth U$650,000 annually. The company sells about two thirds of its products, including essential oils and medicinal extracts, in the international market, they said. According to officials in the Forest and Soil Conservation Ministry who accompanied Deuba on you. There has been plenty of publicity for a while now around the benefits of drinking green tea: lowering of heart disease and cancer rates. Scientists have found that black tea may provide significant protection against the development of skin tumours caused by ultra-violet rays. CSIRO scientists have been testing tea on mice, with results showing an 1 8% reduction in skin cancers among those given green tea, and a 54% reduction among those given black tea! Dr Ivor Dreosti, of the CSIRO's human nutrition division in Adelaide, said green tea has been brewed for its health qualities for more than 3000 years. But the research showed black tea might also have health benefits. Tea contains potent polyphenols and antioxidants, which have been proven to lower the risk of cancer and heart disease. \"The results suggest that, in this mouse model, tea significantly reduced the incidence of actinic (caused by UV radiation) skin cancers. Both teas also appeared to delay the onset of papillomas and skin cancers,\" Dr Dreosti said. - The Weekend Australian, Dec. 28, 1996 NEPAL TO PROMOTE HERBAL PLANTING IN RURAL AREAS The Nepali government will promote the planting of natural herbs in rural areas as a means to generate self-employment. Inspecting a herb production and 113 I the inspection tour, the government will work out programs and policies to make herb planting an income-generating resource for rural people. They said only 10% of Nepal's 7,000 species of natural herbs have been identified so far.

Using a small leaf cutting, Punja has grown ginseng in 12 months rater than the usual three years time frame. - Seed Trade News, Nov 96 SUCCESS IN CULTIVATING GINSENG-LIKE HERB Experts in China have succeeded in artificially cultivating a mountain-side herb that can treat heart diseases, TB and diabetes. The success has been made in Linjiang City in North China's Jilin Province, home of Rhodiola sachalinensis, a traditional Chinese herhaceous herb with the same curative effect as ginseng. At present Linjiang is China's largest production and processing base for the herb, which is scattered across the Changhai Mountain, 1,700 to 2,300 meters above sea level. Cooperation between Linjiang Forestry Bureau and Shenyang Medical Institute has resulted in the extension of an artificial cultivation area for Rhodiola s., which has spread down to 500 metres above the sea. Tonics made of the stems of the herbs have curative effects for diabetes, TB and heart disease, and are being exported to more than 20 overseas countries and regions, including the U.S., Canada, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. - Richters Herbletter, 26-12-96 ORANGES GOING NAKED Lovers of oranges may soon be able to eat their favourite fruit without the hassle of peeling it, as researchers in Florida have developed a technique for loosening the skin of an orange so that they can be peeled before they arrive at supermarkets! The international journal New Scientist, quoting a report by Andy Coghian recently, said the 'naked' oranges are treated with solutions of enzymes. Pectinase enzymes break down the pectins and reduce the pith to a mush and the orange can then he peeled in less than 10 seconds. The technology was developed by Joe Bruemmer and his colleages at the Citrus and Subtropical Products Research Laboratory of the U.S. Agricultural Service in Winterhaven, Florida. They have patented the technology and licensed it to local fruit treatment companies. - The Times of India 'Mumbai), January 2, 1997 Do you have problems with FERAL ANIMALS?

Sleeping for 4 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, or feeling reasonable after a cup of coffee in the morning? There is no law which depicts the amount of time one should sleep. It is often averaged out to 8 hours - but, we are all different. I always ask the question - \"How do you f.i when you get out of bed - energetic, unrefreshed or still half asleep?\" Irrespective, the point ios whether your body has benefitted from spending all those hours in bed. Sleep deprivation can lead to extreme depressive states, anxiety and ill health. On the other hand, depression, anxiety and poor health can lead to insomnia! In the first instance, encouraging natural sleep can lessen the other symptoms. Waking refreshed provides a different outlook on one's problems. In the second case, the body is Herbs used for insomnia or \"twilight\" sleeping do not force the body to sleep. They are non-addictive. They do not interfere with prescribed medication. They simply calm and relax the body, allowing sleep to come naturally. If the body has become accustomed to being unnaturally \"shut down\" by sleeping pills, it may take a short time to re-educate it into relaxing naturally with herbs. In such cases, make the break gradually. Some of the herbs that have proven successful over the centuries are chamomile flowers, valerian root, catnip, dill and fennel seeds. They have been skillfully combined to help you tense, tired body relax and enfoy a full night's deep sleep again. A combination of such herbs is available from natural health supplement retailers.

But alas, we still have not heard from them. When this Interim Council was set up at the beginning of July last year, its stated aim was to unify the industry and to consult with all facets of it on how this could best be done. Now, eight months later, we're still waiting to be consulted. Howard did receive a phonecall in the first week of February from young carrot grower Nick Chambers, who for some reason was bombarded to chairperson of this body. He promised to send us papers to bring us up to date the very next day, but sofar (2 weeks later) they have not arrived and I cannot hold up our mag any longer. In his phonecall Nick made a big mistake straight away by leaving the word 'interim' off and calling the group The Organic Council of Australia. Hold on, said How, you're only the interim Organic Council, mate! Good to bear from Alex Podolinsky, who feels the same way we do and who was to be called next, that the \"Interim\" word had been reinstated! We were informed that a Brisbane consulting firm, McCarthy Consulting, often used by RIRDC, is getting $35,000 from that body to set the organic industry right! Just think what ORGAA (The Organic Retailers and Growers Association of Australia, who have long had the ambition to become the organic umbrella organisation and who could have done it too!), who are used to working on a shoe string budget, could have done with that money. But apparently ORGAA was not acceptable to RIRDC! When this Interim Council was set up, one of the main aims was stated to be to consult with all groups in the organic industry. Who better than ORGAA to have done that? I'm afraid that all this has divided the industry no end. And we were just thinking we were getting somewhere, with the cooperation and dialogue between OHGA, NASAA and BFA growing every day. What a shame, and as usual the Canberra bureaucrats are to blame. Maybe, or rather, probably, they planned it this way! Byron Regional Organic Produce Co-operative Yet another co-op has been formed, with the stated goal of \"building a profitable and enduring organic food and produce co-operative with spinoffs in manufacturing, retail, training and eco- tourism.\" At the moment they are \"seeking financial and resource assistance in this developmental stage to place the project on a solid foundation\". I spoke to manager Ross Brown, who certainly believes in this undertaking and who says that Amanda Vanstone is supportive of the scheme. He says that he has 50 potential members, and is networking intensively with other organisations, including OHGA. I do believe Doug, in the office, spoke to him once. In his introductory letter of November 20, he lists OHGA as one of his advisory bodies! Anyway, good luck to them, but I hope they don't piss too many of our taxdollars away! If you want to know more about this co-op, please ring Ross Brown on 843668. Hassell looking for more money Hassell & Ass, the consulting firm that got the RIRDC funded job of doing the organic survey two years ago, is looking for another job like that. Howard received a letter from them dated Feb 16, with \"a synopsis of a proposal to the Rural Industries Research & Development Corporation (RIRDC) to conduct a marketing study into the Export Potential for Organic Products\". Fortunately they are not asking for funding contributions from the organic industry, as they say they are aware that the industry has difficulties in raising contributions. But they do want letters of support to RIRDC, saying that we really need them to do this study!

Lawn Herbicides Tracked Indoors Residues of widely used lawn herbicides may be tracked into homes and deposited on indoor carpet surfaces or in household dust, according to a recent study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. The study, which examined transport of 2,4- D and dicamba, concluded that 3% of dislodgeable turf residues (i.e. the portion of a pesticide formulation that does not adhere to the turf) were transported to carpet dust and that 0.3% of turf residues were transported to the carpet surface. The authors reported that, once on carpet surfaces, the residues can come into contact with the skin. According to the study, previous research has S Suitable for Herb Planting Opens soil Plants and spaces seeds Covers seeds Packs soil Marks next row 6 seed plates \u2014 standard plates suitable for herbs MAI RDERS WELC ELLIS EQTJIPMIENT (071)62 4682 suggested that transport of pesticides into homes presents significant risks of human exposure, particularly for children who may ingest residues through hand to mouth behaviour. Once indoors, carpets, dust and furnishings may become long-term reservoirs for pesticides because common environmental degradation factors such as sunlight, wind, rain or soil microbes are absent. In the study, researchers applied a pesticide formulation containing 2,4-D. dicamba and mecoprop (X-gro Broadleaf Weed Killer) to sections of a lawn that had not been treated with pesticides for at least 10 years. Participants then walked on the treated plots, staggering their times and walking in different areas so that most of the treated ground was covered. Then they either wiped their feet on a mat or walked directly onto indoor carpeting, both of which had never been used before. Researchers analysed residues tracked onto the carpets at four hours, eight hours and one day after pesticide application. In addition, they measured levels of turf dislodgeable residues on the lawn at these times and over the course of several days. For the first three days after application, the researchers estimated a potential track-in rate of 4.5 micrograms of the pesticides. Use of entryway mats reduced the level of pesticide residues on carpet surfaces by 25% and reduced carpet dust residues by 33%. The researchers estimated that 2,4-L) residues could remain in household carpet dust for up to one year after turf application at concentrations of approx. 0.3 microgram/sq.m.. The authors stated that this level is consistent with levels of 2,4-D that they found in household dust of nine suburban homes. A range of health and environmental impacts have been associated with exposure to 2,4-D, including endocrine disruption, reproductive effects, cancer and toxicity to birds and fish; impacts associated with exposure to dicamba include neurological effects, non Hodgkins lymphoma (cancer) and mutagenicity.
