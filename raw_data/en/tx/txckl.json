Due to my sincerely held religious convictions, I am not able to receive this shot. While I understand I am not legally required to justify the basis for my sincerely held religious belief, neverthele ss, I am providing a few of the reasons why this policy violates fundamental aspects of my Christian faith - and why I cannot, therefore, in good conscience take part in it. As a devout Christian, I am guided in everything I do by my faith in God and the Bible, which I believe to be God's revealed and inspired Word (2 Timothy 3:16 -17). In 1 Corinthians 6:19-20, the Apostle Paul exhorts Christi ans about the importance of their bodies: \"Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body.\" Likewise, Rom ans 12:1 exhorts Christians: \"I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.\" These Scriptures are just a few of many that have informe d my religious convictions regarding my physical and spiritual health that I live by, including my sincere religious objection to receiving any of the COVID vaccines. I must honor God with my spirit, mind, and body, and therefore I must guard what I put in to my body. That includes avoiding, whenever possible, knowingly receiving foreign toxins with harmful or unknown effects, while also maximizing nutrition and cultivating a healthy natural immune system in accordance with God's design. I firmly believe tha t the experimental COVID vaccine ingredients are contaminants that are harmful to my body, and that in addition to the known health risks, there are many unknown risks due to the lack of standard testing and long-term study of these substances . The COVID -19 vaccines are unique in that they do not contain the typical v iral ingredients, but rath er they have never -before -used (at least to this extent) components and designs such as synthetic mRNA and lipid nanoparticles. Very little is scientifically known about these substances in humans including their short term or long term effects on the body. In taking this vaccine, I would be taking part in an experiment. Not only is this unsafe, but most importantly to me, it would be dishonoring to God with my body (i.e. woul d not be \"glorifying God in my body,\" as Christians are called to do, nor taking care of the body God gave me, which \"is the temple of the Holy Spirit of God\"). Especially when there are other known, safe, and effective alternatives both to treat and preve nt COVID -19, including well known substances and holistic methods to nurture and boost our God -given immunity, I cannot justify being injected with the COVID -19 vaccines and still be consistent with my sincere Christian faith. It is also my sincere religi ous conviction that human life begins at conception, that the sanctity of life is precious to God, and that it is morally wrong to destroy innocent human life. (See, e.g. Psalm 139:13 -16, Jeremiah 1:5, Psalm 127:3, Exodus 20:13) The experimental COVID -19 injections manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer both used aborted fetal tissue in the testing process, and those manufactured by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson used aborted fetal tissue in every step of the process - development, production and lab testi ng. It violates my Christian faith to be injected with substances that were the product of such an unethical and morally repugnant process that included the destruction and use of innocent human life. I have been a Christian for many years. As a believer in Jesus, the Holy Spirit lives in me. Jesus said the Holy Spirit will guide each person who repents of their sin and believes upon Him into all truth. I seek God's wil l for my life through prayer, reading the Bible, and relying on the power of the Holy Spirit to help me to do God's will. I believe God's promise that \"if anyone lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally.\" (James 1:5) I have prayed about how to resp ond to the COVID shot directive in light of my religious beliefs. As I have prayed , the Holy Spirit has moved on my heart and conscienc e that I must not accept the COVID shot. If I were to go against the moving of the Holy Spirit, I would be sinning and jeopardizing my relationship with God and violating my conscience. I want to t hank you in advance for honoring my sincerely held religious convictions. Sincerely, ______________________ ______________________ "}
