DARROW* INTRODUCTION In an influential 1986 article, Reinier Kraakman explored the role of third party \"gatekeepers\" in deterring misconduct by declining to support primarywrongdoers. 1 Lawyers and accountants, for example, help to prevent the fraudulen t issuance of securities or serious misrepresentations in financial statements by declining to provide the legal opinions or audits that are needed toclose a deal. 2 Although Kraakman was primarily focused on wrongdoing by actors in the corporate finance sphere, the pharmaceutical marketpl ace provides fertile gro und for the further development of a gatekeeping analysis. Few industries are characterized by such numerous and diverse potential gatekeepers,including physicians, public interest groups, insurance companies, and evenpatients themselves. In addition, a number of federal agencies act as gatekeepersof a different sort, wielding the power to withhold support from \"wrongdoers\" (touse Kraakman's term), but do so on the basis of a statutory duty rather than outof a desire to avoid potential liability. 3 These agencies include the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the Food and Drug Administration(FDA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This Article draws inspiration from Kraakman's framework to explore a particular and perhaps unexpected type of \"wrongdoing\" that is observed in the * Dr. Darrow is a Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics (Program OnRegulation, Therapeutics And Law (PORTAL)) at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and a memberof the law faculty at Bentley University.

Previous work has described the surprising absence ofsubstantial efficacy or advantage exhibited by many of today's most celebratedpharmaceuticals. 4 This lack of efficacy is all the more unexpected given the presence of myriad expert gatekeepers, both public and private, that stand watchover consumer behavior. In fact, so many gatekeepers are at work in thepharm aceutical i ndustry that a reasonable observer might be justifiably skeptical at the assertion that the currently regulatory structure fails to adequately guardagainst the prevalence of ineffective medicines. A closer examination of efficacydata merely turns this skepticism to bewilderment, confirming the absence ofsubstantial efficacy but leading the observer to wonder how such impotent drugscould have traversed so many gatekeepers' watchful eyes, evoking perhaps theimage of Dr. Seuss's ineffectual bee watcher-watcher. 5 This Article seeks to attend to that bewilderment by explaining how the numerous well-intentioned andoften well-respected gatekeepers have not been successful in fulfilling theirgatekeeping duty to protect patients from minimally effective medicines. I. P RIVATE PARTIES AS GATEKEEPERS Pharmaceutical gatek eepers can be divided into two broad categories: public gatekeepers such as the FDA, which regulate drug companies directly, and privategatekeepers such as doctors, which exert varying levels of influence and controlover a patient's consumption of a given drug. 6 This Part examines the role of the private (non-governmental) pharmaceutical gatekeepers, which fall mostcomfortably within Kraakman's meaning of the term. These private gatekeepersinclude not only doctors, who can withhold prescriptions, 7 but also insurance companies, which can withhold reimbursement,8 advocacy organizations, which can withhold endorsements,9 and consumers themselves, who can withhold purchases and thereby vote with their pocket books.10 Although these private actors can be considered gatekeepers under 4.See Jonathan J.

See id. at 380 (noting that consumers may withhold the purchase of an expensive pharmaceutical pr oduct in favor of a less expensive one).2014] PHARMACEUTICAL GATEKEEPERS 365 Kraakman's framework, they are in a sense at the fringe of his analysis, which is primarily directed at gatekeepers that can directly withhold support from thewrongdoers themselves. 11 In contrast, although pharmaceutical gatekeepers could be seen as potentially withholding support for drug company \"wrongdoers\" byrefusing to prescribe or pay for a medicine, it is more natural to view them aswithholding victims. 12 That is, these gatekeepers prevent patients from demanding the wrongdoer's products, rather than directly withholding the supportneeded for drug companies to make their products available on the market. Thissituation, where gatekeepers disrupt misconduct by withholding potential victims,is briefly alluded to by Kraakman in a footnote. 13 In another footnote, the possibility is raised that even victims themselves might serve as their owngatekeepers, 14 a fruitful point of inquiry in the present context given the ability of consumers to purchase over-the-counter drugs, to decline to purchaseprescribed drugs, or to influence physician prescribing by requesting certaindrugs by name. These two unique species of gatekeepers, briefly mentioned butlargely undeveloped by Kraakman, are therefore especially relevant in thepharmaceutical marketplace and it is there that the discussion begins. A. Physicians One of the reasons that people find it so difficult to believe that many drugs lack substantial efficacy is that drugs are prescribed by doctors, who are oftenheld in the highest of esteem. According to Gallup polls, doctors are the thirdmost trusted professionals (after nurses and pharmacists), with public perceptionof doctor trustworthiness gradually increasing since the polls began in 1976. 15 This trust and esteem is not entirely misplaced. Physicians do have substantial,often highly specialized education and training. Some have extensive experiencewith specific medications, medical conditions, or even patients. In addition tosubstantial training and experience, physician gatekeepers are themselvesregulated by \"second-level\" gatekeepers in the form of government licensingschemes, and are required to stay current via continuing medical education. 16 Most importantly, the vast majority of physicians likely have a sincere desire to 11.

One physician reported literally being referredto as \"Dr. God\" by an admiring patient. 18 Nevertheless, there are a number of reasons why physicians do not make the infallible gatekeepers that th eir education, training, public trust, and authority to withhold prescriptions might suggest. In some cases, doctors simply are notinvolved in the decision to purchase a drug, as might be the case with over-the-counter products. When doctors are involved, a number of factors may pushthem in the direction of prescribing a drug despite a lack of substantialtherapeutic value. 19 Pliny lamented that in ancient Greece, \"not even the physicians know their facts\" about pharmaceuticals, the sale of which is \"plainlya showy parade of the art, and a colossal boast of science.\" 20 These sentiments were echoed more recently on the floor of the House of Representatives, withonly slightly more restrained cynicism: [I]t is impossible for any doctor, from his own resources, to be able to pick out the good drugs from the bad ones. Unfortunately, many doctorsrely heavily and sometimes almost exclusively on detail men forinformation with regard to drugs . . . . Drug companies have learned thatdoctors respond to the same kind of emotional appeals as laymen. Theyare influenced by the same advertising techniques that are used by massconsumer advertising. They accept new drugs with amazing rapidity. 21 In addition, patients may request a drug in general or even a particular drug,which is an intended and therefore particularly expected consequence of direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising. 22 Evidence suggests that sales often increase dramatically following DTC drug advertising.23 Where the drug is reasonably 17.

In addition, doctors in the age of managed care face pressures to limit the amountof time spent with each patient. 27 Counseling a patient on his condition, or on appropriate non-drug treatments such as diet and exercise, can be time-consumingand might be viewed as time not particularly well spent in light of low patientcompliance rates. 28 In contrast, once a patient has a prescription in hand, he can head out the door, satisfied that the doctor has done her job. This is not to suggest that physicians would knowingly prescribe an ineffective drug when a substantially more effective drug is available. However,often there are simply no substantially effective drugs even in commontherapeutic areas, such as depression or Alzheimer's. 29 In these cases, prescribing a drug can satisfy the patient, give the patient hope, and possibly even stimulatea genuine improvement caused by the placebo effect. 30 It can also give the doctor 24. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d) (2013). 25.

In modern times, chronocentrism 32 leads some to denigrate ancient healthcare workers (called \"shamans,\" \"medicine men,\" etc., rather than\"doctors\") as practicing superstitious medicine with no basis in science. 33 But in some cases, their treatments may have been just as effective as today'streatments. 34 Adding to the problem is an absence of clearly presented and easily available efficacy data. Although drug labels are required to contain a section describingclinical trial results, this information is buried in section fourteen of the packageinsert, 35 is often written in such a way that it is difficult for doctors (let alone patients) to understand,36 and is not standardized even among drugs within the same category,37 making assessments of comparative efficacy difficult or impossible. The result is that even doctors do not have anything approachingadequate information regarding a drug's efficacy. Worse, the void of non-biased information is often filled by drug company \"detailers,\" who personally visit physicians for the primary purpose of 31.

As a result,they tend to learn about new drugs from roving representatives or fromadvertisements . . . .\" 39 The result of this state of affairs is unsurprising.

While that's a natural assumption to make, it's not true. Studies consistently find thatmany older medicines are as good as\u2014and in some cases better than\u2014newermedicines.\" 40 The pharmaceutical pricing and payment structure provides an additional reason why doctors make imperfect gatekeepers. Physicians themselves do notpay for their patients' drugs, so there is no direct financial disincentive toprescribe any given medicine. 41 Doctors also know that most patients do not bear the full costs of medications, so there is not even an indirect disincentive toprescribe (unless a doctor wants to save a faceless insurance company someexpense). 42 Where patients do bear costs, such as with over-the-counter drugs, uninsured patients, or prescription drug co-payments, doctors may not be attunedto patients' financial circumstances and \"therefore may not think to recommenda lower cost but equally effective generic alternative.\" 43 Not surprisingly, studies have shown that doctors generally do not consider price at the time ofprescribing. 44 In many cases, doctors do not even know the prices of treatments.45 38.

For example, in an ongoing discussion in the AmericanMedical Association (AMA), the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairsrecommended that the AMA adopt a policy that, where benefits of a treatment areequal, physicians should choose the less expensive alternative. 46 Although the recommendation by its terms was limited to circumstances where benefits wereequal, some physicians nevertheless expressed concern \"that making cost-conscious decisions would hamper patient care,\" 47 and the recommendation was not adopted.48 A revised version was reintroduced in 2012 and finally adopted,49 but only over objections that \"physicians would no longer be putting the interestsof their individual patients first if they had to consider the costs of care and theimpact on health care resources.\" 50 A 1968 government task force put it thus: Some have attempted to justify this situation [where moderate or even enormous price differences may exist between pharmaceutical productsof comparable quality] by describing the physician as the patient's expertpurchasing agent. In the view of the Task Force, this concept is notvalid; in most situations, a purchasing agent who purchased withoutconsideration of both quality and price would be unworthy of trust. 51 In summary, doctors make poor gatekeepers because there is little incentive for them to refrain from prescribing substantially ineffective medications, acontinuous barrage of biased information flowing from drug companies and theirdetailers, and considerable reluctance to consider cost even where less expensivetreatment options are otherwise equal. Even completely ineffective drugs cansatisfy patient requests, speed patient throughput time, give patients hope, inducea placebo effect, and give doctors the satisfaction of having acted, all at no costto the doctor, minimal cost to the insured patient, and with relatively low risk.

Task Force on Prescription Drugs: Final Report , in MICKEY C. SMITH , PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UNDER MEDICARE : THE LEGACY OF THE TASK FORCE ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 65 (2001). 2014] PHARMACEUTICAL GATEKEEPERS 371 so many benefits, but this unexpected mix of benefits goes a long way toward explaining why substantially ineffective drugs are able to survive in the market. Returning to Kraakman's framework, we find four criteria that, when present, suggest that gatekeeping is likely to be an appropriate approach to deterringundesirable behavior. They are: \"(1) serious misconduct that practicablepenalties cannot [directly] deter; (2) missing or inadequate private gatekeepingincentives; (3) gatekeepers who can and will prevent misconduct reliably, regardless of the preferences and market alternatives of wrongdoers; and (4)gatekeepers whom legal rules can induce to detect misconduct at reasonablecost.\" 52 This four-part framework is offered by Kraakman as a means to determine when imposing liability on gatekeepers will be an efficient means of deterringwrongdoing, and is not meant as a tool for evaluating the adequacy of anindividual gatekeeper. Nevertheless, the third criterion is useful in helping tounderstand why doctors are no t likely to foster successf ul gatekeeping, namely, because they fail the third criterion's that the gatekeeper \"can andwill prevent misco nduct reliably.\" As discussed above, doctors' ability to prevent misconduct is impaired by the ab sence of clearly presen ted efficacy information, while their willingness to prevent misconduct is eroded by the many reasons toprescribe even drugs that lack non-placebo efficacy altogether. 53 That doctors \"fail\" the third criterion does not mean that gatekeeping cannot work as a strategyto prevent the consumption of ineffective drugs, but it does suggest that if doctorsare to be gatekeepers, their ability and willingness to refrain from prescribingminimally effective medications must somehow be enhanced. B. Insurance Companies It was stated above that the absence of cost reduces the incentive for doctors to act as effective gatekeepers. The same cannot be said of insurance companies,which do bear the financial costs of substantially ineffective drugs and thereforehave an incentive to discourage their use. 54 Predictably, insurance companies have in fact taken steps to promote rational drug use. The most visible amongthese is the creation of tiered formularies, which attempt to provide a financialincentive to patients to avoid low value remedies by scaling co-payments. 55 One health insurer planned to pay pharmacists to convince consumers to switch togeneric drugs, which by law must be \"bioequivalent\" but are almost always 52. Kraakman, supra note 1, at 61. 53. See supra Part I.A. 54. See TOM BAKER , INSURANCE LAW AND POLICY 4 (2d ed. 2008) (discussing the \"moral hazard\" insurance companies face). 55. See Joseph J.

Specialty Drug Tiers May Violate HIPAA's Anti- Discrimination Provisions and Statutory Goals , 32 N. ILL. U. L. REV. 33, 41 (2011) (discussing the development of tiered formularies).372 INDIANA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 47:363 priced lower.56 In light of workable solutions such as these, insurance companies may be best positioned for success as pharmaceutical gatekeepers. In some cases, insurance companies' efforts at rational drug use have proved at least moderately successful. When combination drug BiDil (hydralazine andisosorbide) was introduced in 2005 for the treatment of heart failure, someinsurance companies balked. 57 They stated that they would cover its two components separately, which were available as generics, but would either notcover the high-priced combination product at all or would place it in a disfavoredformulary tier. 58 Despite a joint statement by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology that either the generics or BiDil werereasonable, critics continued to condemn the insurers. 59 Notwithstanding this criticism, sales fell far short of their billion dollar estimates , hovering around $15 million between 2006 and 2008.60 Nevertheless, any enthusiasm at the prospect of insurance companies acting as white knights in the fight against substantially ineffective drugs must betempered by a dose of reality. Although tiered formularies can help to screen outexpensive drugs not justified by their efficacy advantage, the alignment withefficacy is imprecise and may be both under- and over-inclus ive: unde r-inclusive because there is little incentive to screen out cheap but ineffective drugs, and over-inclusive because exorbitantly priced drugs might be placed on a disfavoredtier even if they possess respectable efficacy. An important psychosocial factor is also at play. If an insurance company attempts to discourage the use of an ineffective drug by requiring a highcopayment or withholding payment altogether, it will be viewed not as a whiteknight protecting the public from worthless drugs, but as a cold and greedycorporation that only wishes to prevent everyone's grandparents from obtainingthe medicines that they need (or at least think that they need). 61 T h i s psychological factor can be seen in the BiDil case presented above. It is nosurprise, therefore, that \"most payers in both the public and private sectorswillingly, if complainingly, pay for whatever doctors prescribe.\" 62 Consumer groups, such as the AARP, do not help the situation. These groups generally advocate broader insurance coverage of medicines but do not 56. See Associated Press, Generics May Profit Pharmacists , 36(19) M ARKETING NEWS 14, 14 (2002). 57.

Jerry Avorn, Sending Pharma Better Signals CIENCE 669, 669 (2005).2014] PHARMACEUTICAL GATEKEEPERS 373 necessarily have either the inclination or expertise to discriminate in their efforts based on efficacy level.63 In the international context, the absence of sensible discrimination against minimally effective drugs is exemplified by the vociferousdemand for greater access to Plavix (clopidogrel ) in Thailand. After public outcry, the government issued a compulsory license 64 notwithstanding substantial evidence that the efficacy of Plavix (clopidogrel) is no greater than that ofaspirin, 65 while its risks may be greater.66 Subsequent court proceedings in the United States echoed the lack of evidence of superior efficacy.67 Financial realities also help to explain the half-hearted efforts of insurance companies to rein in consumption of low-value drugs. Prescription drugs accountfor only around ten percent of total health care expenditures, 68 and therefore likely make up a relatively small percentage of insurance company payouts. Therefore,withholding payment for ineffective drugs that patients think they need is likelyto offend many people and inflame anti-insurance-company sentiment, whilesaving relatively modest amounts of money. The urgency of reining in wastefulspending on substantially ineffective drugs dissipates when placed in the contextof a $100,000 hospital stay (though this may be changing as some drug pricesescalate well past the $100,000 per person per year threshold). 69 I n s u r a n c e 63.

Kraakman suggests another financial dimension that can erode the effectiveness of insurance companies as gatekeepers: corruption. 70 Gatekeepers that can be bribed into complicity will obviously make less effective gatekeepers. This has occurred in the pharm aceutical i ndustry where, according to Money magazine, \"drug firms routinely offer insurers millions of dollars in discounts andcash rebates in exchange for favored places on 'formularies[].'\" 71 Preferred formulary placement is a type of endorsement that can increase the volume ofineffective drugs sold. While price negotiation is a normal and expected part ofa market economy, preferred formulary placement can be used to build customerloyalty and switching costs just before the patent on an older and equallyeffective medicine is about to expire. 72 It is evident from this discussion that use of the term \"bribery\" is not intended to imply criminality in the legal sense, but to describe transfers of value thatinduce gatekeepers to be less fastidious in carrying out their gatekeeping duties,a meaning that is consistent with Kraakman's usage. 73 The seriousness of such soft corruption in the pharmaceutical context was acknowledged by Congresswhen it enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, whichincluded the Physician Payment Sunshine Act (\"Sunshine Act\"). 74 The Sunshine Act requires disclosure of any \"transfer of value\" from drug manufacturers tophysicians or teaching hospitals, although it does not prohibit such transfers. 75 Industry pressure to endorse certain drugs can reach the highest levels. Richard Laing is a physician and former World Health Organization (WHO)medical officer that served as co-rapporteur 76 on the Expert Committee that develops the WHO's Model List of Essential Medicines, a formulary-likedocument that guides drug selection and use decisions around the world.

Kraakman, supra note 1, at 62 n.21. 376 INDIANA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 47:363 how an agent for a victim could act as a gatekeeper, explaining that a sophisticated lender can protect borrowers from bad purchasing decisions bywithholding credit. The implicit suggestion is that the borrowers' lack ofsophistication prevents them from accurately valuing the wrongdoer's product,forcing them to rely on gatekeepers. This is a similar problem to that faced bypatients in the context of substantially ineffective medicines, where doctors orinsurance companies are in a position analogous to that of Kraakman's lenders,in that they are more sophisticated and may be in a position to assist consumersin valuing a given drug product. Notwithstanding a relative lack of sophistication, it is not immediately obvious why patients cannot adequately serve as their own gatekeepers. Like allmarket participants, patients have a natural incentive to act in their own bestinterests, which in the present context means consuming medicines that possessthe greatest efficacy (and do the least harm). Truth-in-labeling laws have beenon the books for over 100 years, and now include required disclosures of clinical trial information. The Internet has dramatically increased patient access to druginformation, providing relatively easy access to professional drug labels, 86 medical journal articles,87 and critical reviews.88 Patients intent on investigating have the ability to uncover substantial, if far from complete, information on drugefficacy, just as the author of this Article has done. There are a plethora of reasons, however, why patients fail to screen out ineffective drugs. If efficacy information is challenging for physicians tounderstand, it is all the more so for laypersons. Information about efficacy is not only presented in tiny font that is buried deep within the lengthy package insertin a section labeled \"clinical trials\" rather than \"efficacy,\" but is also generallydescribed in impenetrable jargon that requires a simultaneous understanding ofmedicine, clinical trial practice, chemistry, statistics, and law. In the case ofdrugs that are consumed infrequently, patient demand for efficacy informationmay be inelastically low for the same reason that consumer demand is priceinelastic for infrequent purchases: the transaction costs of obtaining informationare high relative to the frequency of consumption. Pharmaceuticals and otherhealth-related products are literally textbook examples of \"credencegoods\"\u2014products whose attributes are hidden, unknown, or difficult to discern,such as where information-acquisition costs cannot be justified. 89 Demand for efficacy information is also inelastically low both because the risk will generallybe acceptably low due to FDA requirements for approval, and because financial 86.

G EOFFREY PAUL LANTOS , CONSUMER BEHAVIOR IN ACTION : REAL-LIFE APPLICATIONS FOR MARKETING MANAGERS 81-82 (2010).2014] PHARMACEUTICAL GATEKEEPERS 377 cost may often be unnaturally low due to insurance, triggering a type of moral hazard. Patients might rationally conclude that they may as well consume a drugwithout bothering to investigate efficacy information, because there is littlereason not to. These are among the many reasons that consumers have beencharacterized by the Ninth Circuit as \"helpless because [they are] uninformed[about drugs]\" 90 and assumed by the Supreme Court to be \"unable to protect themselves in this field [of pharmaceuticals].\"91 D. Consumer Organizations and Academics If the absence of expertise and information is a problem, an obvious gatekeeping solution is to involve a third party that has sufficient expertise andthat can translate and simplify the relevant information into a usable form. Thisis, more or less, the function performed by Kraakman's lawyers and accountants,who take complex information and convey its material aspects to others in theform of legal opinions and audit letters. Although practicing physicians andinsurance companies may not adequately perform this function, as discussedabove, they are not the only candidates for the role. In fact, the market hasproduced a number of third-party information brokers who can and do takecomplex pharmaceutical efficacy information and translate it into a form that can be more easily understood. These en tities include Consumers Union, Public Citizen, and a host of academic authors, among others. 92 Founded in 1936, Consumers Union is an independent, nonprofit organization93 that is best known for its widely-respected Consumer Reports magazine. Its philosophy involves \"empower[ing] consumers to protectthemselves\" by providing \"a reliable source of information they [can] depend onto help them distinguish hype from fact and good products from bad ones,\" 94 an orientation that makes Consumers Union an attractive potential gatekeeper in thepharmaceutical marketplace where hype and substantially ineffective products are 90.

Si nce 2004,95 Consumers Union has applied this philosophy in the pharmaceuticals marketplace by issuing a series of reports collectively entitledConsumer Reports Best Buy Drugs, which now covers more than 600 drugs thatare used to treat more than fifty conditions. 96 For example, its report on insomnia notes that heavily advertised prescription treatments such as Lunesta(eszopiclone) and Ambien (zolpidem) are effective, but not necessarily any moreeffective than much older and less expensive drugs that are available over thecounter, such as Nytol (diphenhydramine) or Benadryl (diphenhydramine). 97 They may also not be any more effective than much older prescription medicinescalled benzodiazepines, and may be less effective than non-drug treatments such as relaxation techniques. 98 Other individuals or groups have similarly acted as information brokers, seeking to translate complex drug efficacy information into usable form.

Expert Bodies and the Drug Effectiveness Review Project If the gatekeeping ability of doctors and patients is impaired by too little accessible data while the measured reports of consumer groups or academics aredrowned out by too much promotional material, a possible solution is to engagea disinterested and adequately funded expert body that could delve into the datato determine which drugs are meaningfully effective and which are not. Likeconsumer organizations and academics, these entities could use their expertise totranslate complex efficacy information into an understandable form. Unlike nonprofit consumer organizations, however, an expert body could be endowedby the government with the authority to influence policy. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 115 is, like the FDA, one of the twelve agencies under the umbrella of the Department of Healthand Human Services, and works with an annual budget of about $400 m illion. 116 Its mission is \"to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness ofhealth care for all Americans\" by helping people to make more informeddecisions. 117 Its mission is therefore quite broad and not limited to pharmaceutical efficacy. Nevertheless one of its principal activities involves thefunding of eleven \"evidence-based practice centers\" that gather and examineexisting evidence related to healthcare. 118 One of these, the Pacific Northwest Evidence-Based Practice Center, administers the Drug Effectiveness ReviewProject (DERP) 119 which, though not funded by AHRQ,120 has produced and continues to update lengthy and detailed reports that synthesize availableevidence of drug effectiveness. The lengthy, professional-grade DERP reports are divided into a number of therapeutic categories such as allergy drugs, cardiovascular drugs, dermatologic 115. Another initiative, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), was authorized by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, but has a focus much broaderthan drug efficacy and so far has not devoted substantial resources to the efficacy of prescriptiondrugs.

Most visibly, the reports provide much of the information and analysis on which the Consumer ReportsBest Buy Drugs series is based. 122 Less visible is the direct but difficult to quantify impact on policymakers. DERP is funded by eleven nonprofit stateMedicaid agencies (as well as the Canadian Office of Health TechnologyAssessment), 123 and has gone through three rounds of such funding since its inception in 2003.124 Organizers at DERP assert that the impact of the reports is reflected in the decisions of these Medicaid organizations to continue to providefunding to DERP, though not all have done so. 125 Although DERP provides reports that are high quality, unbiased, comprehensive, up-to-date, and publicly available, the ability of DERP to act asa gatekeeper should not be overstated. If few people have heard of Best Buy Drugs , fewer still have engaged in careful study of any of the DERP reports, so direct impact on patients and physicians may be modest at best. Moreover,awareness of the DERP reports is not the only challenge; a presentation at the2011 AHRQ annual conference lis ted \"[i]nitial prescriber as an obstacle that frustrates evidence-based prescribing. 126 Indirect impact via Medicaid coverage decisions seems more likely, but specific changes in policycausally related to DERP's efforts are difficult to ascertain. Given that Medicaidprescription drug spending constitu tes only around 6% of overall U.S. prescription drug spending, 127 the impact on medicine use may be modest. 121. Final Documents , OR.

Expert Bodies and the UK Model: NICE The United States is of course not alone when it comes to the need for the rational use of medicines. One of the AHRQ's foreign analogues, the UnitedKingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), is notablefor the widespread attention it has r eceived. Fo unded in 1999, NICE is an independent, government-f unded expert body that evaluates new drugs and other treatments for evidence of effectiveness. 128 The expertise of its 270 staff members129 is supplemented by four external collaborating centers130 as well as the input of pa tient groups, healthcare organi zations, pharmaceuti cal companies, clinicians, and other stakeholders.131 Databases such as MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane are consulted for evidence. Once draft guidelines are developed,they are made available for external review by stakeholders, providingtransparency and peer review, before final guidelines are issued. 132 One might expect that NICE's focused expertise, broad input, transparency, government endorsement, and relative neutrality should earn its guidelines farmore respect than what is accorded the advertisements and other promotionalefforts of drug makers, whose interests in a market-based economy are obvious. In the view of much of the public, however, this is not the case. Instead ofrevering expert bodies for their help in screening out substantially ineffectivedrugs, NICE has been condemned as an arbiter of death, 133 a state of affairs that no doubt elicits exuberant jollity from dr ug manufacturers whose products do not even meet the very generous and flexible standard applied by NICE.134 In effect, NICE and other similar organizations face a public relations conundrum notunlike that of insurance companies: if they decline to endorse a drug because itfails to meet even minimally relevant efficacy thresholds, they are reviled by thepublic. 135 Likely aware of this concern, the United Kingdom tipped the balance in favor of coverage by requiring the UK National Health Service (NHS) to pay 128.

In 2010, reports circulated that the government would bow to public pressure and further reduce NICE's power.137 The public's condemnation of the negative evaluations by NICE is understandable, but misguided. It is argu ably true, as the criticism often asserts, that placing a value on even a few weeks or months of extra life is not the placeof government. 138 However, among the 21% of interventions that are not recommended by NICE139 are drugs that have such little benefit that it would be unsurprising if further, more thorough and unbiased study showed them to becompletely ineffective. The decision by NICE to not recommend certainAlzheimer's drugs in mild cases of the disease, for example, was harshlycriticized 140 and vigorously opposed by industry,141 notwithstanding reputable evidence that efficacy was \"below minimally relevant thresholds.\"142 Similarly, the decision by NICE to refrain from recommending Avastin (bevacizumab) in2010 was characteri zed as a betrayal b ecause the drug \"can prolong the lives of breast . . . cancer patients,\" 143 but in 2011 the FDA recommended removal of Avastin's (bevacizumab's) breast cancer indication because, according to the 136.

Oddly, public skepticism of expert, transparent bodies that methodically evaluate evidence and welcome input from a broad array of stakeholders isgreater than its skepticism of self-interested pharmaceutical companies. Whetherthis reflects the triumph of irrational optimism over considered thought, a generaldistrust of government interference, or the power of advertising and promotion,the result is that expert bodies such as NICE make only somewhat effectivegatekeepers. Because victims view these bodies as barriers to a chance at health,however small, rather than guardians against fraud and substantially ineffectivemedicines, such bodies can be of only limited effectiveness as gatekeepers. II. THE GATEKEEPER ACHILLES HEEL: DRUG EFFICACY HEURISTICS The absence of efficacy information combined with the difficulties faced in evaluating efficacy through use can lead to the use of heuristics when evaluatingefficacy. 145 Although patients may be most susceptible to these heuristics, even experts such as physicians and members of insurance company formularycommittees are not immune from their influence. Underlying them are a numberof cognitive biases, 146 and so alluring can they be that the term \"halo\" will be used in order to convey the almost mystical aura of value that they engender. Thehalos described below are the Achilles heel of the gatekeepers' mission,distracting patients from acting as their own gatekeepers and causing push-backby patients and others when more rational or better informed gatekeepers try toperform their gatekeeping role. A. The Patent Halo Most new drugs are patented and thereby able to benefit from a \"patent halo,\" the perception or assumption that patented items are of higher value thanunpatented on es simply because they are patented. 147 According to one 144.

Evidence of this can be found in the acknowledged jury bias in favor of patentees. See386 INDIANA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 47:363 commentator, a patent \"appears to consumers and investors as clear proof of superiority, the government's version of a Good Housekeeping Seal ofApproval.\" 148 Donald Chisum, the author of the leading patent treatise, noted how this dynamic has been regarded as particularly important in thepharm aceutical industry: Early decisions established a higher standard of proof of the utility of inventions claimed to have value in the treatment of human disease. These decisions reasoned that issuance of a patent gave the drug or othermedical invention an 'appearance of authenticity,' an 'obliqueimprimatur of the Government' that might be used to mislead anddeceive the co nsuming public. 149 The Supreme Court has also long acknowledged the assumption of respect accorded to patented products,150 and numerous commentators have noted the public's admiration and respect for patents in general,151 no doubt spurred along by the romantic image of the brilliant independent inventor creating breakthroughproducts in his garage. 152 Pharmaceutical companies have sometimes quite John R.

REV. 319 (2008). 2014] PHARMACEUTICAL GATEKEEPERS 387 sensibly leveraged the patent halo as part of their efforts to increase sales.153 As explained infra , there is no basis in patent doctrine to justify such a patent halo, since patents may be obtained on inventions that have lower value than existingproducts. 154 The practice of implying that a government mark should be recognized as a symbol of drug efficacy is neither recent, nor limited to patents. More than 100years ago, the British Medical Association noted that pharmaceutical advertisers\"took to inserting in their advertisements phrases intended to suggest that theInland Revenue stamp upon their packages implied some sort of Governmentguarantee of the efficacy of the remedy.\" 155 The stamp was in fact merely connected to the collection of taxes, but the government nevertheless eventuallyfelt compelled to correct the public's misimpression, altering the stamp such thatit bore the cautionary disclaimer: \"This stamp implies no Governmentguarantee.\" 156 B. The FDA Approval Halo Patients falsely assume that if the FDA approved a drug, it must be very effective. A recent study by researchers at Dartmouth Medical School surveyed2944 adults to assess their understanding of the meaning of FDA approval. 157 The researchers found nearly four in ten people believed, mistakenly, that the FDAonly approves drugs that are \"extremely effective.\" 158 One in four respondents erroneously believed that the FDA would not approve drugs with serious sideeffects, and the same proportion that only \"extremely effective\" drugs could beadvertised. 159 As the researchers pointed out, none of these statements is true.160 Others have pointed out the common misimpression that FDA approval of a new 153. Explicit promotion of patent status is more often seen in non-prescription medications, such as sunscreen.

However, in light of frequent newscoverage of drug \"patent cliffs\" and the like, the public can reasonably infer that advertisedmedicines are probably patented.

The overall message of these findings and observationsis that FDA approval confers a halo of efficacy that is not warranted. The fact that FDA approval suggests efficacy levels that are not warranted has not stopped businesses from using, or trying to use, the \"imprimatur\" 162 of FDA approval to their advantage. Internet pharmacies prominently boast thattheir products are \"FDA-approved,\" 163 while direct-to-consumer television advertisements for individual drugs often include the phrase \"FDA approved\" ina way that suggests a certification of value. 164 The biotechnology industry has welcomed the possibility of formal review by the FDA because the \"FDA Sealof Approval\" would be beneficial for marketing purposes. 165 The FDA \"seal of legitimation\" has been used for decades, thus conditioning generations ofconsumers to misunderstand the meaning of FDA approval in a way that favorssales. 166 The significance of the FDA approval halo to the pharm aceutical i ndustry is confirmed by the particularly interesting and unusual case of Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. IVAX Pharmaceuticals , in which Mutual claimed that IVAX was implicitly promotin g its anti-malaria products as FDA-approved when in fact they were not.167 The drug in question, quinine sulfate, was never FDA approved becau se it has been used fo r hundreds of years to treat malaria and was therefore \"grandfathered\" under the 1938 Federal Food, Drug and CosmeticAct. 168 In 1998, the FDA restricted quinine products to prescription-only status on the basis of safety concerns, triggering the requirement that any further salewould require a New Drug Application (NDA). 169 Mutual filed an NDA and obtained FDA approval in 2005,170 but IVAX and others did not, instead continuing to sell their quinine sulfate through channels that implied FDAapproval. 171 The court found that IVAX's representations were likely false or 161.

As United States Senator Dodd recently stated, \"[t]hroughout the world, the FDA seal ofapproval\u2014the words 'FDA Approved'\u2014has stood as the gold standard for safetyand quality.\" 173 The FDA does act to ensure that manufacturing practices are up to par and that purity standards are met, for example. But these aspects of qualityappear to be unjustifiably extended in the minds of a substantial proportion ofconsumers to assumptions about efficacy (and safety) that are not warranted. FDA oversight is therefore a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the FDAworks to protect the public by assuring minimum levels of safety and quality. Inthis respect, the creation of the FDA has made the public safer and less likely tobe duped than it was prior to the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. At the sametime, however, FDA approval is often misunders tood to certify efficacy levels that are simply not part of its statutory mandate. This gives the patients a falsesense of security that counter-intuitively increases the public's vulnerability. Whether the negative impacts of substituting \"FDA approved\" for caveat emptor exceed the benefits of FDA oversight is a subject ripe for future research. C. The Novelty Halo There is an acknowledged bias in favor of new products and against old ones, 174 what has sometimes been referred to as \"the cult of the new.\"175 \"Just a simple count of the number of times you have heard the phrase 'new andimproved' should indicate the size of the consumer appetite for new andsupposedly better products[,]\" offers a sales management textb ook. 176 Use of the novelty halo to sell medical treatments goes back at least as far as Pliny (23-79A.D.), who chronicles the successful tactics of physicians who achieved fame by\"reversing the treatment\" of their predecessors and \"swe[eping] away all receiveddoctrines.\" 177 As if he lived today, when every new drug is a breakthrough 172.

The Expert Halo Patients assume that if a drug is prescribed by a physician, who is presumed to be knowledgeable about drug efficacy, the drug chosen by this expert must bethe most effective drug available. In some cases, the expert halo is combinedwith the novelty halo. As one commentator mistakenly asserts, \"the marketplacevirtually demands that a new drug must be more effective than alreadyestablished competitors if physicians are to prescribe it.\" 180 A review of top- selling drugs suggests otherwise. For example, the twelfth best-selling drug of2012 was Plavix (clopidogrel), 181 a blood thinner, more than $5 billion of which was prescribed by doctors in that year alone.182 Doctors prescribed this massive volume of Plavix (clopidogrel) even though the FDA repeatedly warned as earlyas 1998 of th e lack of Plavix's (clopidogrel's ) superior efficacy over time-tested aspirin, noting that \"claims that suggest Plavix has been 'proven' to bemore effective than aspirin are misleading because they are not based onsubstantial evidence.\" 183 The FDA again warned against Sanofi's misleading and unsubstantiated ove rstatements of efficacy in 2001,184 and a study published in 178.

Moreover, the aforementioned lack of established benefitis in relation not to aspirin, but to placebo. E. The Prescription Halo Patients and others may assume that prescription products are more powerful than over-the-counter (OTC) products because the dispensing of prescriptiondrugs is regulated by the government. Once again, the assumption of greaterefficacy is not necessarily true. Most new OTC drugs today were initially soldas prescription products. Frequently cited examples include pain medicines likeAdvil (ibuprofen) and Tyleno l (acetaminophen) and heartburn medicine Zantac (ranitidine), 187 but one could add allergy medicines Zyrtec (cetirizine) and (miconazole), 188 among many others. More generally, a drug's prescription status often has more to dowith the amount of time since its entry on the market or with its safety profilethan with efficacy. Nevertheless, consumers may misinterpret frequentadvertising statements that drugs are \"available by prescription\" 189 to mean that the drug is very potent, when by law prescription status means only that \"becauseof its toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect . . .

Veblen goods can, perhaps, be distinguished in that thehigh price of a Veblen good is generally associated with high social status,luxury, or exclusivity, whereas high drug prices are more likely to be perceivedas implying effectiveness or quality. 192 The signaling value of the high price, however, is shared in common. Economists have long acknowledged the practice of relying on price as a proxy for value.193 In a seminal 1945 article, Stanford economist Tibor Scitovszky explained that the perceived relationship between price and valuemight not be irrational, because if buyers do not find prices justified, sellerswould eventually have to lower them. 194 Scitovszky cautioned, however, that the relationship may break down where goods are complex or where new productsare frequently introduced to replace old ones, 195 the precise scenario faced with drugs where chemical formulae and clinical trial data are incomprehensible to theordinary consumer and where dozens of new drugs are introduced each year. Marketers evidently believe that a premium price can increase sales even with simple products whose characteristics can be directly and immediately perceived. Michelob, for example, once sold its beer using the slogan, \"Michelob, America'shighest-priced beer!\" 196 More generally, retailers across the spectrum of product categories can readily be observed to use a two-price system: the \"regular\" price,to signal value, and the \"sale\" price, 197 both sometimes prominently marked upon 191.

The two-priced system can be commonly observed in: automobile dealerships,2014] PHARMACEUTICAL GATEKEEPERS 393 the product. Like other sellers, pharmaceutical companies have sometimes deliberately priced their products higher than a competitor's product regardless ofcomparative efficacy, in order to convey an impression of superiority. Forexample, in Our Daily Meds , Melanie Peterson describes Glaxo's strategy of pricing newcomer Zantac (ranitidine) at a substantial premium over incumbentTagamet (cimetidine). 198 The two products both fall within the category of drugs known as H2 blockers, as reflected in their similar generic names, and researchat the time showed them to be both safe and equally effective in the treatment ofulcers. 199 Nevertheless, the new drug was priced as much as 50% higher than Tagamet (cimetidine), a move described by Peterson as \"like that of anunderweight boxer trying to fool the prizefighter with his swagger.\" 200 Within three years, the demand of a credulous public allowed Zantac (ranitidine) tosurpass Tagamet (cimetidine) in sales. 201 Even more disconcerting is that, although in this case the two drugs were nearly equivalent in efficacy, nothingprevents the use of such a pricing strategy even where the new drug is inferior in efficacy. Such pricing strategies reflect the notion, articulated by historian Barbara Tuchman in the 1970s, that \"a patient's sense of therapeutic value is in proportionto expense.\" 202 Tuchman was speaking of the powdered pearls, emeralds, and other rare treatments that were prescribed to victims of the plague during the1300s, but she recognized that the perception of high price as a value proxy is\"not unknown to modern medicine.\" 203 Indeed, the signaling value of high price may reflect an underlying universal human tendency. According to acommentator on the drug trade in ancient Rome, \"[a] cheap concoction to themsignified a bad one, and hence physicians and druggists were advised to addharmless spices, perfumes and suchlike to common, effective, and inexpensivebases in order to convince their rich customers that here was something reallyworth having.\" 204 Pliny himself railed against \"the stupid convictions of certain where the manufacturer's suggested retail price (M SRP) is rarely the price paid; supermarkets, where \"customer loyalty cards\" allow consumers to pay less than the \"regular\" price, thepharmaceutical i ndustry, where the average wholesale price (AWP) \"[does] not reflect the physicians' actual acquisition cost, or anything close to it.\" In re Pharm.

G. The Unrealistic Optimism Halo Absent efficacy data, patients may significantly overestimate the likelihood of therapeutic value in the spirit of blind optimism. In an influential paper, NeilWeinstein of Rutgers University reported study findings demonstrating thatpeople \"tend to believe that they are more likely than their peers to experiencepositive events and less likely to experience negative events.\" 207 The relevance of this optimism bias in the health sector has been noted.208 In the 1950s, Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons discussed the \"optimistic bias\" that pervades medicaltreatment, often taking the form of an irrational belief in efficacy, and closely tiedto the \"physician's so frequent insistence that his patients should have'confidence' in him.\" 209 It is plausible, furthermore, that such optimism bias could synergistically combine with pharmaceutical company claims of theoretical\"subpopulations\" to inflate any expected therapeutic benefit beyond reason. Thatis, because of the tendency to overestimate one's chances of experiencing positiveevents, patients may tend to believe that they are more likely to fall within thefavored theoretical subpopulation than is objectively probable, 210 assuming arguendo that such subpopulations exist. The placebo effect is perhaps the most tangible indication that irrational patient optimism regarding drug efficacy exists. As one team of researcherspointed out, placebos by definition do not produce any therapeutic effect; it is themeaning mistakenly ascribed to them that leads to the so-called \"placebo (arguing that Hippocratic recipes were \"based on luxury and exotic ingredients,\" while those during subsequent centuries were even more expensive and complex). 205.

This inference is buttressed by theonly modestly larger difference (about 10%) between placebo and aspirin, acrossboth branded and unbranded categories, which suggests that the large majority ofany therapeutic benefit in the case of aspirin and headache pain is created byoptimism (i.e., placebo effect) rather than by the chemical agent.

The Last Resort Halo Desperate patients will try anything , from risky or unproven experimental therapies, 214 to traveling abroad to obtain medical treatment that is criminalized in the United States,215 to submitting themselves to the care of those whose only product or service is unadulterated fraud.216 The unifying theme of patient actions such as these is the strong desire to believe that a treatment exists combined withthe knowledge that there may be little or nothing to lose by trying. 217 I n a statement to Congress in 1911, President Taft urged legislators to better protectthe public from \"the raising of false hopes of speedy cures,\" asserting that\"[t]here are none so credulous as sufferers from disease.\" 218 I f t h e d e s i r e t o 211.

In these cases, the desire to believe that a treatment ismeaningfully effective can predominate even where the medical condition inquestion is of only moderate or minimal severity. I. Halo Convergence and Human Perception Each halo might alone be sufficient to convince even educated and circumspect patients to believe in the efficacy of a substantially ineffectiveremedy. Halos are rarely found alone, however. Instead they generally convergeto create an overwhelming impression of efficacy that is stubbornly difficult to dislodge even when the evidence is uncontroverted and clear. When a consumercompares a heavily advertised, new, patented, FDA-approved, and very expensiveproduct that is prescribed by his trusted physician, to a much cheaper, older, over-the-counter product, the tendency to believe that the expensive new product isbetter can be irresistible. If it were not better, one might reason, how could it bethe third (or fifth, or eleventh) best-selling drug in the world? As with moviesand other forms of popular culture, wide awareness and success of a product canitself lead to greater success, cons tituting a type of cumulative product advantage. 219 Study results have confirmed the triumph of halo convergence over actual product efficacy. One study of the Canadian pharmaceutical market, for example,revealed that 80% of the increase in drug spending between 1996 and 2003resulted from consumer use of \"new, patented drug products that did not offersubstantial improvements on less expensive alternatives available before 1990.\" 220 Similarly, an independent French organization examined 998 new medicinalproducts and indications from the period 1990-2011 and concluded that onlyfifteen offered \"a real advance\" and of those fifteen, only two were breakthroughs(\"bravo,\" to use the organization's own language). 221 Patients, therefore, make poor gatekeepers due to a confluence of factors. Kraakman's analysis provides a starting point for understanding this 219. Cf. Derek De Solla Price, A General Theory of Bibliometric and Other Cumulative Advantage Processes , 27 J. AM. SOC'Y INFO. SCI. 292, 292 (1976) (noting the benefits of cumulative advantage to income, academic publication success, citation success, and journal prominence). 220. See Steven G.

The proxies for efficacydiscussed above, which can take on greater importance in the absence ofinformation, take the theory a great deal further, explaining not only whyconsumers fail to screen out ineffective drugs, but why they may tend toaffirmatively demand them. III. REGULATORS AS GATEKEEPERS The lack of efficacy exhibited by many drugs is surprising in light of the highly regulated nature of pharmaceutical products themselves, with substantialinvolvement by government agencies or actors from the time a drug is firstpatented to when it is advertised to when patients or others bring suit for physicalor economic harms. This Part examines how ineffective drugs are able to slipthrough the hands of government gatekeepers, not as a consequence ofincompetence, inadequate resources, or failure of attention to duty, but despitegeneral compliance with all legal requirements at every stage. It should be noted that government actors do not seem to be what Kraakman had in mind in his discussion of gatekeepers, which he limits to private third- parties that can prevent misconduct by withholding support. 223 He specifically distinguishes direct enforcement against wrongdoers from the enlistment of thosewrongdoers' \"associates and market contacts\" in an effort to indirectly discourageundesirable behavior. 224 In addition, Kraakman is most interested in gatekeepers who are motivated by liability, and to some extent reputational harm, rather thanstatutory duty. 225 Nevertheless, government actors are gatekeepers in several important senses that are consistent with Kraakman's framework. Most importantly, they are ableto disrupt misconduct by withholding support, such as when the United StatesPatent and Trademark Office declines to grant a patent on a new molecular entitythat might form the basis of a new drug. Moreover, much of the enforcement bygovernment agencies that will be discussed is ex ante, serving to preventwrongdoing by limiting access to the mark et rather than puni shing conduc t after the fact. This characteristic is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word\"gatekeeping,\" that is, controlling access. 226 222. Kraakman, supra note 1, at 56. 223. Kraakman's classification of \"public\" and \"market\" gatekeepers is not to the contrary, since by \"public\" Kraakman merely means those private gatekeepers who are motivated by liabilityrather than private incentives such as the fear of reputation loss. See id. at 62. 224. Id. at 53. 225. Id. at 53-54 & n.3, 60 (gatekeeper liability); id. at 61 & n.20 (reputational (\"a person398 INDIANA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 47:363 It is also important to clarify what it is that these government gatekeepers are guarding against. Kraakman describes the deterrence of \"misconduct\" or\"wrongdoing,\" 227 and his examples reveal a focus on gatekeepers who can withhold support for misconduct that is criminal or at least obviously pernicious: doctors and pharmacists, as guardians against drug abuse; 228 sellers of firearms who must obtain export licenses to deter actions by foreign enemies;229 social hosts that restrain the actions of their intoxicated guests;230 and auditors that prevent securities fraud.231 Although this type of wrongdoing could occur in the context of pharmaceu tical efficacy, such as wher e a drug comp any fra udulently falsifies clinical trial data to obtain FDA approval, the \"wrongdoing\" that is thefocus of the present discussion is ordinarily much more subtle, involving theinduced but voluntary transfer of vast amounts of wealth to companies whoseproducts in reality are worth little or nothing. It is \"wrongdoing\" in a systems-based sense, akin to Lawrence Lessig's concern with the institutional corruptionof politicians. 232 Voluntary transactions, of course, are the essence of a market-based economy, and it is not suggested that limitations should be placed on anindividual's right to pay a high price for a small gain in health. The concern isthat the absence of clearly communicated efficacy information is causing doctors,patients, and others to demand drugs that they never would ask for if theyunderstood just how ineffective these drugs are. Kraakman does mention suchgatekeepers against \"soft\" wrongs, such as his reference to lenders that protectunsophisticated borrowers from bad investments by refusing to lend. 233 T h e USPTO and the FDA are like Kraakman's lenders in that they can effectivelyprevent consumption of bad drugs by unsophisticated doctors and patients. Another government agency, the FTC, acts as a gatekeeper by policingmisleading promotional activities. It is explained below why none of theseagencies is an adequate gatekeeper, and why they may ironically be making theproblem worse. A.

The USPTO is a sensible gatekeeper notonly because it can withho ld patent protection fro m undeserving products, but because patent doctrine straightforwardly specifies that an invention cannot bepatented unless it is \"useful.\" 235 This utility requirement traces its roots at least as far back as the United States Constitution, which provides that patents may begranted in order \"to Promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,\" 236 and patents are therefore traditionally conceived of as temporary rewards forcontributing useful inventions to society. Any optimism that patent law's utility requirement could screen out ineffective drugs by negating patentability, however, can be quickly dispelled. The bar for patentable utility is so low that almost any invention will meet it. 237 Even an invention that could be \"used\" to mislead customers has been heldpatentable. 238 Patentable utility has thus appropriately been described as de minimis standard239 and it has been noted that even inventions that have no proven use in the real world can meet it.240 Reflecting this almost inconsequentially low threshold is the USPTO's cautionary statement to would-be inventors that an alleged utility \"of a complex invention as landfill\" would notbe sufficient. 241 The rationale for a minimal utility standard in patent law seems to be that the market is the best judge of an invention's worth. In the landmark opinion ofLowell v. Lewis , Justice Story rejected the view that an invention must be better than\u2014or even as good as\u2014the existing state of the art, stating that \"whether it[the invention] be more or less useful [than existing products] is acircumstance very material to the interests of the patentee, but of no importanceto the public.

Justice Story could nothave had in mind the modern pharmaceuticals marketplace, where consumersspend billions of dollars on products that scarcely merit the label \"extensivelyuseful.\" During the patent period at least, these products rarely sink intocontempt and disregard on the basis of a lack of meaningful efficacy. Another possible gatekeeping lever at the hands of the USPTO is the non- obviousness standard, another requirement for patentability. 243 P r e v i o u s physician-commentators have advocated elevating this standard, therebypreventing the patentability of \"one-atom changes\" to existing molecules thatresult in supposedly-innovative new molecular entities. 244 Non-obviousness, however, is a very rough proxy for efficacy that focuses on the technicaldifficulty 245 of creating the invention, and not on its therapeutic value. It is entirely possible that a new drug with decidedly unimpressive efficacy mightmeet even an elevated non-obvious standard. 246 Celebrex (celecoxib), Vioxx (rofecoxib), and the other COX-2 inhibitors are good examples. These drugsresulted from years of research and development 247 that culminated in 1998 in the market entry of Celebrex (celecoxib), a type of supposed \"super aspirin\"248 that selectively inhibits only one of two cyclooxigenase (COX) enzymes. Thestructures of the COX-2 drugs depart markedly from those of ibuprofen, aspirinand other previous non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS), the larger classto which COX-2 inhibitors belong. 249 As the first in its class, Celebrex 242.

The manufacturer's adjacent claim that Celebrex (celecoxib) delivers \"powerful\" relief,251 however, was less deserved. The expensive, new, innovative, patented, FDA-approved drug provided no greater pain relief than anyother NSAID, nor did its sponsor claim that it could do so. 252 The government- funded Oregon Evidence-based Practice Center concluded bluntly that \"COX-2selective NSAIDs and nonselective NSAIDs did not clearly differ in efficacy forpain relief, based on many good-quality, published trials.\" 253 Thus, the two principal tools that the USPTO might use to screen out ineffective drugs aresimply not up to the task. Even if one were inclined to raise the utility or non-obvious standards, which has been recommended as appropriate where the pace of invention is fast, 254 it is no simple matter to discern the efficacy of a drug. As a primarily technicalagency with expertise in invention but not in the clinical trials that produceevidence of efficacy, the Patent and Trademark Office is poorly positioned toevaluate questions of efficacy in the context of complex health policyconsiderations. 255 Following concerns over a lack of drug efficacy expressed by Congress256 and the President257 in 1962, a provision was enacted into law that requires the FDA, if requested by the USPTO, to provide technical assistancewith respect to the patenting of a new drug product. 258 As codified and amended at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 372(d), this provision now reads: The Secretary [of Health and Human Services] is authorized and directed, upon request from the Under Secretary of Commerce for 250.

The Secretary is further authorized, upon receiptof any such request, to conduct or cause to be conducted, such researchas may be required. 259 The stated purpose of \u00a7 372(d), as described in the accompanying 1962 SenateReport, was unambiguously to reduce the number of patents issued ontherapeutically questionable drugs: \"Presumably, if the Patent Office, which hasno physicians or pharmacologists on its staff, is able to secure information fromHEW [i.e., from the FDA 260] on the therapeutic properties of drugs\u2014which it is now able to obtain only with the consent of the patent applicant\u2014fewer patentsmay be issued.\" 261 However, the USPTO appears to have rarely, if ever, requested information pursuant to this authority. Only three cases, all from thenow-defunct Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, cite \u00a7 372(d): the first notesthat the USPTO did not exercise its authority under the provision; 262 the second cites \u00a7 372(d) only to explain that the USPTO hypothetically could consider, asan aid when deciding the question of utility, the FDA's determination that a drugis \"totally unsafe in all circumstances,\" a determination that the court found wasnot present in the case at bar; 263 and, the third cites the provision, in dissent and in a footnote, to further the dissent's argument that the USPTO rather than otheragencies is ultimately responsible for determining patentability. 264 One commentator interpreted these cases as rebuffing the USPTO's attempts toexercise its authority under \u00a7 372(d), 265 though the cases themselves suggest that only publicly available information was used and that no information was\"furnished\" by the FDA in the collaborative sense suggested by the statute. 266 259. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 372(d) (2013). 260. \"HEW\" refers to the Department of Health Education and Welfare, pred ecessor to the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department to which the FDA belongs. 261.

Theassistance that the FDA would be able to provide would therefore be limited. Insummary, the USPTO cannot act as an effective gatekeeper because the utilityand non-obviousness doctrines are not up to the task, because the agency lacksappropriate health-related expertise, and because the USPTO \"gate\" is too farupstream in the drug development process. B. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration The FDA is perhaps the most obvious gatekeeper given its statutory duty to decline approval of any drug for which \"there is a lack of substantial evidencethat the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have.\" 267 A careful reading of this statutory provision, however, reveals that there is norequirement that a drug possess any particular level of efficacy. So long as a drugcompany does not \"purport or . . . represent\" the drug to have greater efficacythan it actually has, the drug can be approved. 268 As a result, the efficacy of approved drugs ra nges from near 100% in the case of certa in contraceptives, antibiotics, and vaccines, to near 0% in the case of certain Alzheimer'smedications, depression medications, and cancer medications. Like judicialattitudes toward patent law's de minimis utility standard, the prevailing view ofthe FDA's similarly de minimis efficacy requirement appears to be that themarket is the best judge of a drug's worth. In other words, although the FDA isa gatekeeper against absolutely worthless drugs, \"the market\"\u2014whatever entitiesor individuals that comprises\u2014is erroneously assumed to be a good gatekeeperagainst almost-but-not-quite worthless drugs. The FDA approval scheme, then, continues by and large to embrace the philosophy of caveat emptor with respect to any non-zero level of drug efficacy. Yet, at the same time the phrase \"FDA approved\" is used in advertisements, andperceived by the public, as if it were a guarantee that a drug has some meaningfullevel of efficacy. 269 Either of these approaches might have merit. One might take Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary , 93d Cong. 292 (1973) (statement our view, 21 U.S. 372(d) [sic] is an acceptable provision by which the Patent Office may seek the advice of other government scientists in particular instances without significant adverse consequences to the publicor to the patent applicant. 21 U.S.C. 372(d) was enacted in 1962 as an alternative to a proposalwhich would have in effect conditioned the patent grant upon a determination by a separate federalagency of greater therapeutic effect. A patentability requirement of this nature was wisely rejectedby Congress.\"). 267. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d) (2013) (\"[H]e shall issue an order refusing to approve the application.\") (emphasis added). 268.

Alternately, one might more liberally argue that the FDA should be given the responsibility to protect thepublic from ineffective remedies. The current system, however, combines thesetwo approaches in the most unfortunate way possible, with patients andphysicians assuming that the FDA has vetted drugs for meaningful levels ofeffectiveness, while the FDA in fact leaves this discerning task to those samepatients and physicians, fully compliant with its statutory duties. In this wayFDA oversight ironically may make the efficacy problem worse, creatingunjustified perceptions of government approval that can i nduce market players to let down their guard. This is not to say that the FDA is always ineffective as a gatekeeper of efficacy. Not only does the FDA have the power to reject entirely fraudul ent remedies, it also administers a statutory framework that provides incentives thatare roughly\u2014perhaps very roughly\u2014scaled to a drug's likely level of efficacy. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) provides three years ofexclusivity for new indications of existing medicines. 270 Because doctors can legally prescribe FDA-approved drugs for unapproved indications, the marginalgains in real-world efficacy brought about by a new indication approval are likelyto be small. New molecular entities (NMEs), by contrast, are assumed to be arough proxy for increased innovativeness and thus, indirectly, efficacy levels. The FDCA offers five years of exclusivity for such NMEs (or four years, if patentinvalidity or noninfringement is alleged). 271 Under the Orphan Drug Act, seven years of market exclusivity may be granted for drugs that treat rare diseases orconditions. 272 The rationale, recorded in the corresponding session law, is that there may be no adequate drugs at all for these conditions \"because so fewindividuals are affected\" that pharmaceutical companies might not be expectedto even attempt development of such drugs. 273 If no drugs are currently available to treat an orphan disease, it could be reasoned, the efficacy gains of a newmedication are likely to be larger than if drugs are already available. Unfortunately, even in this category products all too often disappoint. Ananalysis by a French nonprofit drug evaluation organization found that \"[n]oneof the 6 orphan drugs examined by Prescrire in 2011 represented a real breakthrough.\" 274 Biologics, whose theorized impressive gains in efficacy have WASH. & LEE L.

Simply b ecause a drug can be categorized as an NME or a biologic, or purportedly treats an orphan disease, does notnecessarily say anything at all about its absolute (or even relative) level ofefficacy. IV. POST-HOC GATEKEEPING : ADMINISTRATIVE AND COURT -MEDIATED ENFORCEMENT If overstatement of drug efficacy were truly a problem, it might be expected that government regulators and other interested parties would seek legal redress. In this regard, the record does not disappoint. A number of lawsuits have beenbrought by individuals, competitors, and insurance companies alleging fraudagainst drug companies for their inflated claims of efficacy. Governmentregulators, notably the FDA, have also acted via administrative channels totemper exaggerated drug efficacy claims. For various reasons explored below,the majority of these efforts have either failed or been only partially effective inpreventing misleading information from reaching both consumers and the medicalcommunity. A. Enforcement Actions by the FDA The regulation of drug advertising is shared between the FTC, which regulates advertising for over-the-counter products, 277 and the FDA, which regulates the advertising of prescription drugs as well as labeling for bothprescription and over-the-counter products. 278 Although the FTC has taken frequent action against overs tatements of efficacy in the dietar y suppl ements sector,279 litigation by FTC against overstatements of efficacy for over-the- 275.

The FDA's authority derives from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which allows the FDA to take action against any drug that is \"misbranded.\"281 Misbranding includes not only \"labeling [that] is false or misleading in anyparticular\" 282 but also television advertisements for prescription drugs that contain untrue statements regarding \"side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness.\"283 Pursuant to these provisions, the FDA rebukes drug companies with regularity for their overzealous claims of efficacy. A television advertisement forAmgen's Enbrel (etanercept) for example, resulted in a warning letter from theFDA that noted that the advertisement's description of the drug as a\"BREAKTHROUGH,\" combined with other attributes of the advertisement,implied efficacy beyond what had been proven. 284 Despite the \"overwhelming impression conveyed by the TV ad . . . that Enbrel completely clears skin withpsoriasis,\" no evidence supported this claim. 285 To the contrary, the FDA offered its opinion that \"Enbrel is not a breakthrough therapy for moderate to severeplaque psoriasis because it does not offer any documented material difference thatoffers a significant advantage over other drugs already available . . . .\" 286 In another case, G.D.

Despite diligent efforts by the FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP, formerly the Division of Drug Marketing and Advertising, or DDMAC),a tide of information indicating or implying greater efficacy than is presentcontinues to reach consumers. In part, this is due to the sheer magnitude ofviolations.

The results are predictable: the FDA website notes that the agency \"see[s] many ads at about the same time the public sees them.\"301 The public (including doctors) therefore continues to be subjected to misleading efficacyinformation until corrective action is taken. Even if implemented in its currentform, the guidance would only require submission for six categories ofadvertisements, in light of the FDA's limited resources. 302 Even corrected or technically compliant advertisements may nevertheless convey an impression of effectiveness that is not warranted. For example, aCelebrex (celecoxib) advertisement aimed at physicians states that \"[w]ith all theexperience that you and thousands of other physicians just like you have with theproven efficacy and benefit of superior safety of Celebrex, why wouldn't youwant to prescribe Celebrex?\" 303 By strategically inserting the word \"efficacy\" among the words \"proven,\" \"benefit,\" and \"superior,\" viewers are left with theimpression that the efficacy of Celebrex (celecoxib) is superior, even though thiswas not stated. The effect is reminiscent of the legal cannon of noscitur a sociis , which \"counsels that a word is given more precise content by the neighboringwords with which it is associated.\" 304 In this case, however, the tendency of an audience to consider context has been used to mislead. Pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to refrain from testing the limits of what they can claim or imply in advertisements. Although the FDA canand has taken action even against advertisements that only subtly overstateefficacy by the \"totality of [the] presentation,\" warning letters themselves carryno penalties and generally request only that the recipient desist. 305 Legislation in Drugs/.../Guidances/UCM295554.pdf, archived at http://perma.cc/49P5-4GDK. 301.

If anoverstatement of efficacy can increase sales by 10%, a $250,000 penalty is lessthan one day's additional revenue. B. Lawsuits by Consumers Alleging Fraud In theory, consumer fraud actions might also serve as a check against false or misleading claims of efficacy. Co nsumers and non-pr ofit public interest organizations, however, have often encountered significant legal barriers whenattempting to bring these claims. In one case, a group of consumers sought classaction status in a suit against Johnson & Johnson for running advertisements thatallegedly included misleading claims of superiority of Johnson & Johnson'sPepcid (famotidine) product over Tagamet (cimetidine). The plaintiffs werelikely emboldened by a then-recent holding in the Southern District of New Yorkthat had enjoined the advertisements in question. 310 Despite this favorable precedent, the New Jersey trial court denied class certification, noting thatalthough common questions of law and fact existed with respect to the allegedlymisleading nature of the advertisements, 311 individual questions regarding bringing a misbranding action in court) is to issue public warning letters . . . .\"). 306.

This minimal amount isnot enough to motivate most consumers to bring suit. In addition, although totaleconomic losses may aggregate to millions or billions of dollars when oneconsiders the entire consumer population for a given pharmaceutical product, theinability to aggregate the claims associated with those losses into a single lawsuitmeans that it will not be financially attractive for atto rneys to undertake representation. The inability to obtain class certification is only one of a number of challenges that consumers face in attempting to bring a successful fraud claim. Several of these challenges are illustrate d in a 2003 New Jersey case, in which a state consumer advocacy group brought a fraud claim against Schering-Ploughand two of its advertising agencies, alleging that the allergy medicine Claritin(loratadine) had been portrayed as more effective than it actually was. 314 The advertisement in question told consumers that \"you . . . can lead a normal nearlysymptom-free life again.\" 315 The New Jersey appeals court dismissed the action not because Claritin (loratadine) was in fact as effective as claimed, nor becausethe plaintiffs did not suffer a loss. Instead, the court provided three primaryreasons for dismissing the action for failure to state a claim. First, it found thestatement that assured patients that they could \"lead a normal nearly symptom-free life again\" was of fact\" but was instead \"mere puffing\"and as such not actionable. 316 Second, the court found the statement not actionable because the advertisement was subject to FDA oversight.317 Third, the Super. Ct. Law Div. 1997). 312. Id. at 799. One legal commentator has described an emerging presumption against class certification and argued that this presumption creates a regulatory gap for potentially harmful drugs. See Young K.

First, the court failed to consider the nature of pharmaceutical products as both Veblen-like goods (tothe extent that desirability rises as price rises) 321 and simultaneously as credence goods (goods for which consumers cannot ascertain value even afterconsumption). 322 With goods that exhibit both of these characteristics, \"mere puffery\" combined with elevated prices may have a greater impact than withordinary goods, because there is little else on which to base value. It also ignoresthe obvious and measurable impact that advertising has on aggregate purchases. It is notable that the court specifically rejected the \"fraud on the market\" theory,often used in securities fraud litigation, as inappropriate in context of drug litigation. 323 Second, in relieving the defendant of liability based on FDA oversight authority, the court apparently did not consider the possibility that the FDA mightnot have the resources to exercise that authority in all cases that merit suchoversight. The court also failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that privatelitigants may bring suit alongside state and federal agencies in an analogouscontext where the consumer interest is implicated, namely, antitrust. In fact,United States antitrust law provides an incentive for private litigation in the formof treble damages awards, 324 based in part on the premise that private suits improve compliance with the law by harnessing the aggregated power of \"privateAttorneys General.\" 325 Even in the pharmaceuticals context, the Supreme Court has affirmed the right of private citizens to bring drug products liability claimsbased on state failure-to-warn laws, notwithstanding the FDA's substantial 318.

This is because, by definition,physicians (or other prescribers) will necessarily be involved in any lawfulpurchase by a lay consumer of prescription drugs. 327 If the presence of these prescribers is viewed as breaking the causal link between the advertising and thetaking by patients of a medication, fraud cannot be established because causationis a necessary element of a fraud action. Even if plaintiffs were to put forth datashowing a correlation between increased advertisements and increased drug sales,courts have repeatedly stated that such evidence would be insufficient to establishcausation. 328 Because prescription drugs are the most advertised and most costly class of drugs, the largest economic losses will arise far more often in this contextthan in the context of non-prescription drugs. Unfortunately, Schering-Plough is not alone in dismissing fraud actions that allege misrepresentation of drugefficacy. 329 C. Lawsuits by Insurers Alleging Fraud Third-party payers, such as insurance companies, generally have greater institutional capacity to bring legal ac tion based on fraudulen t overstatements of efficacy. One might therefore expect that such relatively sophisticated third-partypayers would enjoy a larger measure of success in bringing suit. In fact,analogous cases by payers have not only failed, but have done so at very earlystages of the proceedings. As with the consumer lawsuits discussed above, thepharmaceutical manufacturer's shield from liability derives from the presence ofphysicians, who break the causal link.

Perhaps in an attempt to assuage judicial guilt for whatit feared might be perceived as an unjust result, the majority offered meekly that\"[i]f the plain language of the statute results in an outcome that the Legislaturenow deems improper, it is for the Legislature, not this Court, to narrow theapplication of the statute by amending or redrafting its terms.\" 340 Other lawsuits by state attorneys general have met with greater but hardly overwhelming success.

Lawsuits by Competitors Alleging Fraud Competitors may also serve as a check against false or misleading claims that overstate a drug's efficacy. One such case pitted McNeil, the maker of ExtraStrength Tylenol (1000 mg acetaminophen), against Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), the maker of Aspirin Free Ex cedrin (1000 mg acetaminophen combined with 130 mg caffeine). 345 At the time of the litigation, BMS planned to spend $10 million in an advertising campaign that touted Excedrin as more effective thanTylenol (acetaminophen). 346 Since both products contained identical amounts of acetaminophen, a pain reliever, the only difference in active ingredients was thepresence in Aspirin Free Excedrin of 130 mg of caffeine. The court consideredit \"well settled by the FDA that caffeine acting alone is not effective in relieving headache pain,\" but noted that the FDA had not determined whether caffeinemight be effective as an adjuvant, that is, a substance that is not effective itselfbut that increases the efficacy of the primary active pharmaceutical ingredient. 347 The court ultimately fo und the claims of Excedrin's ( acetaminophen; caffeine) superiority over Tylenol (acetaminophen) to be literally false, and enjoined theadvertising campaign. 348 Other Lanham Act cases in the pharmaceuticals market have reached similar outcomes.349 In another case involving Tylenol (acetaminophen), the Second Circuit upheld the district court's finding that claims of superiority of Anacin(aspirin; caffeine) over Tylenol (acetaminophen) were false. 350 Similarly, when the makers of competing heartburn medications Pepcid (famotidine) and Tagamet(cimetidine) sued each other for false claims of superiority, the court enjoinedboth parties' advertisements on the basis that they were false or misleading. 351 In another heartburn case, the Second Circuit found false or misleading claims byProcter & Gamble that Prilosec (omeprazole) provided relief for twenty-four 344.

In one contested television advertisement for the pain medicationAleve (naproxen), a narrator stated: \"It isn't ALEVE is gentlerto your stomach lining than aspirin.\" 354 As these words are spoken, the television viewer sees a visual of a medicine cabinet with the three competitor drugs, andeach one is discarded as it is referred to. 355 The obvious implication is that Aleve (naproxen) is a nd aspirin, but a careful listener would notice that no claim of superiority to Advil(ibuprofen) was actually made, the only statement being that \"ADVIL isn'tstronger.\" The court held that, under Third Circuit preced ent, there could be no liability for intent to misl ead unless the defendant's conduct rose to \"egregious proportions,\" which the court did not find to be present. 356 Cases brought by competitors therefore appear to be among the most successful in checking exaggerated claims of efficacy. This success, however,is generally limited to checking claims of comparative, rather than absolute,efficacy. While these lawsuits may therefore represent a gain for one competitoror another, consumers can still be left with the impression that both medicines aremore effective in absolute terms than they actually are. More importantly, areview of the cases just cited reveals that they address only over-the-counterproducts. The general absence of comparative efficacy litigation among sponsorsof prescription drugs suggests that litigation is not having a substantial salutaryeffect on misleading claims for this class of drugs. F. Antitrust Actions Fraud may be the most likely legal doctrine to assail false claims of pharmaceutical efficacy, but it is not the only one. Antitrust law also provides apossible means for redress, at least where a defendant has attempted to obtain ormaintain a monopoly position through unfair means. In Walgreen Company v. AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals , Walgreen, Eckerd, Rite Aid, and other retailers alleged that AstraZeneca had attempted to monopolize the market, in violation ofSection 2 of the Sherman Act, by \"us[ing] distortion in its efforts to persuade 352.

Another districtcourt dismissed a similar Sherman Act counterclaim brought by a generic drugmanufacturer that sought to compete with AstraZeneca. 361 G. Synthesis of Litigation and Implications An examination of cases alleging fraudul ent overstatement of efficacy reveals that the large majority of these cases have been dismissed, not because the drugswere found to in fact be very effective or even because plaintiffs did notexperience a loss, but because plaintiffs did not adequately allege that theoverstatements of efficacy caused the economic harm that resulted. 362 The clear message from the judiciary is that the various plaintiffs could not prove that theywould not have purchased or reimbursed the drug, but for the statements of themanufacturer. Legally, this outcome is understandable, even if not inevitable. If an action did not cause an adverse outcome, then the actor cannot be held responsible. What the cases fail to adequately answer, however, is the puzzling question ofwhy the plaintiffs did not adequately allege causation, a traditional and well-known element of any fraud claim. 363 The failure of plaintiffs is all the more 357.

The seeming mystery, however, has an obvious explanation. Plaintiffs cannot allege that the defendant's misrepresentations caused the plaintiff (as opposed to his doctor) to rely to his detriment, because such reliance is barred by the learnedintermediary doctrine. 364 In the words of one court: Even if [the plaintiffs] had offered evidence indicating that they had relied in some way on Defendants' misrepresentations, it wouldultimately be of no consequence. The learned intermediary breaks thechain in terms of reliance, since the patient cannot obtain prescriptiondrugs without the physician no matter what they believe about them. 365 Therefore, in order to adequately allege causation, a plaintiff has to establish thatthe doctor who prescribed the medication would not have done so if that doctorhad not viewed the television advertisements of (or other communications from)the manufacturer. The court must then be willing to allow a fraud claim toproceed based upon reliance by one party (the doctor) that caused harm to anotherparty (the patient or insurance company). Fraud claims traditionally requirereliance by the same party that experiences the loss, 366 but in the learned intermediary context, courts seem willing to flexibly apply the elements of fraudto allow recovery. 367 The stumbling block, however, is that it is not easy for a physician to admit reliance, because to do so would be to admit that the principal reason sheprescribed a drug was that she had recently viewed a television advertisement orother promotional material. Professional pride and the need to project an aura ofcompetence in order to maintain an effective doctor-patient relationship makesuch a statement awkward at best. In addition, if causation derives not from asingle discrete event, but rather from the accumulation of a number ofcommunications that come to the doctor both directly and indirectly over a periodof time, it may be difficult for the doctor to precisely determine which particularcommunication or communications caused her to prescribe, issues of professionalimage aside. knowledge of its truth; (4) the defendant intended the plaintiff to rely on the representation, and the plaintiff actually relied on the representation; and (5) the defendant's actions caused an injury.\"). 364.

Partof the problem, however, ironically lies in the simple fact that there are so manyregulators that responsibility becomes complex or even unclear; each potentialgatekeeper assumes that the others are either individually or collectivelyperforming the gatekeeper role. The FDA, for example, screens out drugs whoserisks are not offset by sufficient efficacy or who have absolutely no efficacy at all,but otherwise assumes that patients and their doctors will determine whether adrug is worth using. 368 Similarly, the PTO issues patents on drugs (or any invention) that can meet the extremely minimal utility hurdle, leaving it to \"themarket\" to weed out low value inventions. 369 Patients and doctors are willing to try anything that might work, so long as the risks are not too high, and assumethat the FDA has done its job in only allowing sufficiently effective drugs ontothe market. 370 Insurance companies may have a financial interest in preventing the consumption of ineffective drugs when cheaper alternatives would do as well,but cannot intrude too far into the physician (or patient) arena without risking asignificant publicity backlash. 371 It is a complex web in which the buck is passed once and passed again but never settles with any one party. Regardless ofresponsibility or blame, however, it is ultimately the pub lic that suffers. 368. See supra Part III.B. 369. See supra "}
