We are here to help you understand how acupuncture and stress reduction tools can support you or your loved one.

Acupuncture theory understands the ear is a microsystem of the body. Auricular acupuncture treatments help move the body and mind towards homeostasis or balance. Ear acupuncture is often administered to treat pain, stress, anxiety and substance abuse withdrawal. We utilize standard protocols that have been around for decades. The use of these point combinations continue because they work! 2- FAST: First Aid Stress Tool Patients receive instruction on how to clear difficult emotions using the First Aid Stress Tool known as FAST. FAST is a safe, EFFECTIVE , noninvasive stress reduction tool that combines diagnostic pulse points used in acupuncture with emotional points used in neuro emotional technique. Together, auricular acupuncture combined with the First Aid Stress Tool can provide a life raft to people struggling. Acupuncture helps harmonize the body, mind and spirit. The First Aid Stress Tool is a proven technique that patients can take home with them. It's used to clear stress, pain and anxiety. Patients often report how it has changed their lives.
