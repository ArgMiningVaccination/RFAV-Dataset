Engineering (Beijing) ; 2021 Oct 28. Artigo em MEDLINE | ID: covidwho-2268751 ABSTRACT [Traditional Chinese medicine](TCM) has been successfully applied worldwide in the [treatment]of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]( [SARS-CoV-2]). However, the pharmacological mechanisms underlying this success remain unclear. Hence, the aim of this [review]is to combine pharmacological assays based on the theory of TCM in order to elucidate the potential signaling pathways, targets, active compounds, and formulas of herbs that are involved in the TCM [treatment]of COVID-19, which exhibits combatting via docking [analysis]or [network pharmacology]based on existing data. The results of these [reports]indicate that an intricate regulatory mechanism is involved in the [pathogenesis]of COVID-19. Therefore, more pharmacological [research]on the natural herbs used in TCM should be conducted in order to determine the [association]between TCM and COVID-19 and account for the "}
