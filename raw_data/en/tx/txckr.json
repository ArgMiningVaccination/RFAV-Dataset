Boldt and Lewis J. Haldorson ABSTRACT : Juvenile pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha were sampled through the summer and fall of 1998 in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Samples collected in the field and a bioenergetics model were used to esti- mate consumption of zooplankton by juvenile pink salmon during their first three months at sea. Based on an initial weight of 0.26 g and a growth rate of 4% body weight per day, a pink salmon would consume 27.9 g of wet weight in a 93 d residence time in Prince William Sound. A cohort of juvenile pink salmon would con- sume 5.53\u00d7109 g wet weight or 0.05 g Carbon/m2/year (g C/m2/year) in PWS. Sensitivity analyses indicate that residence time, mortality, and diet strongly influence consumption estimates. Assuming a primary production of 100 to 300 g C/m2/year, a transfer efficiency of 20%, and secondary production of 20 to 60 g C/m2/year, con- sumption by juvenile pink salmon was about 0.06-0.45% of annual secondary production. This estimate would be higher (up to 8.28%) if only nearshore areas of Prince William Sound are considered. The average daily consumption of large calanoid copepods was 2.2\u00d710-4 g C/m2 or 1.5% of the large calanoid copepods avail- able. If standing stocks were fixed over a 10-day period, pink salmon consumption would represent a large proportion of large calanoid copepods (15%) and amphipods (19%). Consumption by pink salmon and other planktivores needs to be considered along with geographic and interannual variability in zooplankton biom- ass and productivity when examining the carrying capacity of the Prince William Sound ecosystem. INTRODUCTION The amount of fish production a marine environment can support has been examined previously, but is inad- equately understood (Sanger 1972; Brodeur et al. 1992; Cooney 1993). A period of high salmon production ac- companied by decreasing salmon weight (Bigler et al. 1996) in Alaska during the mid-1970s to the late 1990s has been attributed to changes in atmospheric and oce- anic conditions in the North Pacific (Beamish and Bouil- lon 1993; Coronado and Hilborn 1998; Mantua et al. 1997). A popular hypothesis states a regime shift (change in atmospheric and oceanic conditions) in themid-1970s, as indicated by a positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation index, may have changed the production and carrying capacity of the ecosystem (Beamish et al. 1995; Mantua et al. 1997; Anderson and Piatt 1999). Additionally, hatchery production of salmon in Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska increased in the mid- 1970s to the 1990s, raising concerns over the ability of prey resources there to support the large numbers of hatchery fish (Hilborn and Eggers 2000). The regime after the mid-1970s was character- ized by an intensified Aleutian Low that increased pre- cipitation and freshwater runoff into the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), resulting in increased stability of coastal north Authors: JENNIFER L.

Zooplankton biomass increased significantly in the northeast Pacific between the early 1960s and 1980s, possibly benefit- ing from elevated primary production levels (Brodeur and Ware 1992). Zooplankton from the north GOA are transported into PWS in the westward-flowing Alaska Coastal Current or with an influx of deep water through Hinchinbrook Entrance (Kline 1999; Eslinger et al. 2001). Increased zooplankton may have positively af- fected zooplankton predators, such as pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha , in the north GOA and PWS, which experienced a higher abundance from 1976 to 1999 (Beamish et al. 1997; Sharp et al. 2000). Increased pink salmon numbers in the north GOA and PWS may be linked to increased zooplankton bio- mass; however, the average body size of returning salmon decreased by about 20% between 1975 and 1993 (Ricker 1995; Bigler et al. 1996), and has remained lower than pre-1976 weights (Donaldson et al. 1995; Morstad et al. 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999; Sharp et al. 2000; Johnson et al. 2002; Gray et al. 2002). It is possible that planktivory by the historically large number of pink salmon is affecting zooplankton density. For example, pink salmon abundance is inversely related to macrozooplankton biomass and directly related to phy- toplankton biomass in the subarctic North Pacific, sug- gesting top-down processes may be controlling zooplankton abundance (Shiomoto et al. 1997). Another hypothesis is that higher temperatures after the regime shift (Beamish 1993) increased metabolic and energetic demands reducing salmon weight, despite increased zooplankton biomass. Alternatively, it is possible that the decrease in pink salmon weight may be due to food-limitation during pink salmon early life history, despite the increase in zoop- lankton biomass. PWS is a large estuary in the north GOA that supports large runs of both wild and hatch- ery pink salmon (Cooney 1993). Pink salmon year class strength is thought to be determined during their first few months at sea (Parker 1966; Peterman 1987; Karpenko 1998; Beamish and Mahnken 2001). Main determinants of survival and growth during these months include food availability, temperature, salinity, salmon fry emerge or are released into PWS inspring and spend the first four months of their lives in PWS, initially occupying shallow nearshore habitats, before moving into deeper waters and eventually into the GOA (Cooney et al. 1981; Willette 2001). Compe- tition for limited food during this time period may have negative effects on pink salmon growth and therefore, their ability to escape size-selective predators (Cooney et al. 1995). The objective of this paper was to estimate zoop- lankton consumption by juvenile pink salmon in PWS. To accomplish this objective we: (1) estimated con- sumption of zooplankton by PWS juvenile pink salmon in their first three months at sea using a bioenergetics model, and (2) investigated the sensitivity of consump- tion estimates to variable temperatures, diets, mortality rates, energy content, and model duration. We also dis- cussed the estimates of zooplankton consumption in relation to available estimates of zooplankton produc- tion and standing stock. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Areas and Sampling Methods The 1997 brood year of pink salmon was sampled on five occasions in 1998 with a variety of nets (Figure 1; Table 1): (1) In May the Prince William Sound Aquac- ulture Corporation provided hatchery fry at times of release, (2) in the northeast GOA in July, (3) in mid- July in PWS, (4) in the northeast GOA in early August samples were provided by the National Marine Fisher- ies Service, Ocean Carrying Capacity project, and (5) in the northeast GOA in October. Hatchery releases, May 1998 Pink salmon fry were provided by PWS Aquaculture hatcheries at the time of release (Figure 1; Table 1). Samples from Cannery Creek Hatchery (CCH) were collected from the early (May 7) and late (May 29) release groups. Two samples were also collected from Armin F. Koernig Hatchery (AFK), one early (May 8) and one late (May 24). One sample was collected from the Wally Noerenberg Hatchery (WNH) early release group (May 1). All samples were frozen for later labo- ratory analyses. Gulf of Alaska, July 1998 The Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics project con- ducted a fish sampling survey in the north GOA along the Seward hydrographic line July 10-15, 1998 (Figure113 A Bioenergetics Approach to Estimating Consumption of Zooplankton Boldt and Haldorson 1). A small number of pink salmon were collected on this cruise during daylight hours. These fish were sampled within 32 km of shore with variable-meshed gillnets. Gillnets used were 200 m in length, 3 m deep, and were comprised of four 50 m panels. The four panels had mesh sizes of 19 mm, 25 mm, 32 mm, and 38 mm stretched mesh. Two gillnets were tied together and soaked for about 2 - 4 hours. All pink salmon collected were measured and frozen for later laboratory analy- sis. Prince William Sound, July 1998 The Apex Predator Ecosystem Experiment project conducted a survey of fish abundance and distribution in three areas of PWS from July 14 to 19, 1998. Salmon were collected at two stations in each of the three ar-eas, Port Gravina in northeast PWS, Naked Island in central PWS, and Whale Bay-Bainbridge Passage in southwest PWS (Figure 1; Table 1). Blind sets were completed at each predetermined station during day- light hours with a purse seine (200 m long, 20 m deep, 25 mm stretched mesh). Pink salmon collected were measured and frozen for later laboratory analysis (Table 1). When there was a large catch of salmon, 10-15 pink salmon were preserved in 10% buffered formalin for diet analyses. Gulf of Alaska, August 1998 The fourth sampling period was conducted in the north- ern GOA August 1-3, 1998 by the Ocean Carrying Ca- pacity project. Fish were collected with a surface trawl that was 198 m long, the mouth opening was 25 m wideFigure 1. Sampling locations in PWS and the GOA in 1998. Samples were collected from three of the four pink salmon hatcheries in PWS, C1, C2, the Seward hydrographic transect were sampled in July and October. Main and intermediate stations (such as GAK1i, not shown) are located every 18.5 km and 9.25 km, respectively, along the Seward transect. Five stations were sampled in the GOA in August (CP1, CP2, GP, CD1, CP2). 114 Articles and 35 m deep, and the cod end had a 1.2 cm mesh lining. Samples were collected during daylight hours at five stations (Figure 1; Table 1). Two stations were sampled off of Cape Puget, one nearshore (CP2) and one over the shelf (CP1). Another two stations were sampled off of Cape Douglas, CD1 and CD2. The fifth station was sampled nearshore off of Gore Point (GP). Fifty pink salmon were collected from each station and frozen for later laboratory analysis. Gulf of Alaska, October 1998 The Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics project con- ducted sampling along the Seward hydrographic line in the north GOA from October 2-9, 1998. Fish were col- lected with the same variable mesh floating gillnets that were used on the Seward hydrographic line in July, 1998. Sampling was conducted at night and nets were soaked for approximately 2 to 3 hours at 10 stations(GAK stations) along the transect (Figure 1; Table 1). Fish sampled were identified, measured, and frozen for later laboratory analysis. Bioenergetics Model The Hewitt and Johnson/Wisconsin model (Kitchell et al. 1977; Hanson et al. 1997) was used to estimate con- sumption by pink salmon during their residence in PWS from May to August in 1998. The model estimates how much prey a fish would need to consume to achieve an observed growth rate while accounting for respiration, egestion, and excretion (Appendices A and B). Physi- ological parameters for adult pink salmon, provided in the software for this model (Fish Bioenergetics 3.0; Hanson et al. 1997), were used since information on juvenile pink salmon is limited (Appendices A and B). Field-generated model inputs include: diet, fish growth in weight, and fish energy content. Prey energy con-Table 1. Pink salmon collection dates and station locations in 1998.

The sources of each model input and values over which they were varied for sensitivity analyses are specifi- cally addressed below. Consumption was calculated as prey consumed (g) over a 93 day (d) residence in PWS. To convert con- sumption to grams of carbon (C) consumed per square meter of surface, consumption was divided by the area of PWS (8.8\u00d7109 m2; Grant and Higgens 1910) and multiplied by 0.0844 g C/1.0 g wet weight (Omori 1969). Diet Prey weights were estimated in the laboratory, using values obtained from the literature (Cooney et al. 1981) and provided by K. Coyle (University of Alaska Fairbanks, personal communication; Boldt and Haldorson In press ; Boldt 2001). The diet of pink salmon sampled in PWS during July 1998 was used for model days 62-93 (July) (Tables 1 and 2; Boldt and Haldorson In press ; Boldt 2001). The diet of pink salmon prior to model day 62 was estimated from the literature (Cooney et al. 1978). Prey energy content Energy content of prey items utilized in the model were averaged from literature values and assumed to beconstant for the months that were modeled (Table 3). Prey items comprising a small percentage of pink salmon diets (polychaetes, unidentified crustaceans, and inver- tebrate eggs) were grouped together and labeled as \"other\". The caloric content of this \"other\" category was calculated as an average of caloric values of the different prey items (Table 3). The proportion of each prey group that was indigestible was estimated from the literature where possible, otherwise, it was assumed that 10% of the prey was indigestible (Table 3). To examine the effect of variable prey energy density on consumption estimates, the model was run with a low calorie diet (consumption of only nauplii, 2,045 J/g wet weight) and a high calorie diet (consumption of only insects, 4,532 J/g wet weight) over the entire period of PWS residency (Table 4). Weight of pink salmon Initial (0.26 g) and final (9.60 g) pink salmon weights utilized in the bioenergetics model were based on wet weights and a growth rate of 4% as determined in the laboratory and in combination with literature values (Boldt 2001). Wild and hatchery pink salmon have been reported to weigh 0.2 -0.3 g when they enter the sea (Pritchard 1944; LeBrasseur and Parker 1964; Cooney et al. 1978; Parker and Massa 1993). Previous growth estimates in PWS were primarily between 3% and 5% body weight per day (Willette et al. 1994). All hatcheryTable 2.

These results indicate juvenile pink salmon grew in body weight from 3.6% to 6.7% per day with a median value of 4.6% (Boldt 2001). The estimates of growth rates in this study do not take into account size-selective mortality or gear selectivity, however, they are within the range of values estimated by Willette et al. (1994) using coded wire tags. Energetic content of pink salmon An average energy content value of pink salmon sampled in 1998, 4.171 kJ/g wet weight, was utilized in the bioenergetic model (Table 1). Energy content val- ues were estimated in the laboratory with a bomb calo- rimeter and were observed to vary significantly among stations within sampling periods and among sampling periods (Boldt 2001). The energy content was not var- ied over the 93 d in the original model; hatchery fish energy content was expected to be higher because of artificial feeding conditions. The average energy con- tent of pink salmon measured upon release in May 1998 was 4.102 kJ/g wet weight, and in July 1998 was 3.883 kJ/g wet weight (Boldt 2001). In a sensitivity analysis these two values were used for days 1 and 93 in a varia- tion of the original model to examine the effects of predator energy content on the consumption estimate (Table 4).Temperature The model was run using 6\u00b0C, 8\u00b0C, 10\u00b0C, and 12\u00b0C for days 1, 32, 62, and 93, respectively. Juvenile pink salmon are usually found near the surface, therefore estimates of water temperature in the upper 1 m of the water column were used for the model (Cooney et al. 1995; Vaughan et al. 2001). The water temperature in the upper 1 m of the water column of PWS is typically about 4\u00b0C in early April and warms to 12\u00b0C by August (Cooney et al. 1995; Vaughan et al. 2001) (Table 4). Within the bioenergetics model, temperature is incremented by linear interpolation. The model was also run with minimum (4\u00b0C, 6\u00b0C, 8\u00b0C, 10\u00b0C for days 1, 32, 62, 93) and maximum (8\u00b0C, 10\u00b0C, 12\u00b0C, 14\u00b0C for days 1, 32, 62, 93) temperature values to examine the effect of temperature variation on consumption estimates (Table 4). These temperatures were chosen because average sea surface temperatures in the north GOA from April to June vary by approximately \u00b12\u00b0C (Cooney et al. 1995). Daily water temperatures at 20 m depth were also available from mooring data at GAK 1 in 2000 (Figure 2; Royer and Weingartner 2002; T. Weingartner, University of Alaska Fairbanks, personal communication). This daily temperature data was uti- lized in the model to examine the effects of daily tem- perature variation on overall fish consumption. Population numbers The numbers of fry released from hatcheries have been documented (Sharp et al. 2000), but the numbers of wildTable 3.

To estimate the number of wild fry entering PWS in 1998, wild fish re- turns in 1999 (9,426,391; estimated using wild stock catch plus the aerial escapement index) were divided by the average survival rate of hatchery fish in that year (7.39%) (Morstad et al. 1996; T. Joyce, Alaska Depart- ment of Fish and Game, Cordova, personal communi- cation). The number of wild fry (127,561,263) was added to hatchery fry release numbers (542,383,070) to estimate the total number of fry entering PWS in 1998 (669,944,333). To estimate a range of wild fry numbers that could enter PWS, the marine mortality of wild pink salmon was altered by \u00b110% to derive populations of 115,964,785 to 141,734,737 (Table 4). Mortality A total mortality of 69.00% was used for the first 40 d and 26.87% for the last 53 d. These values are based on mortality estimates from British Columbia (B.C.), since there are no available estimates for PWS. Bella Coola River pink salmon experienced 59.00 %-77.00% loss of the initial population in their first 40 d at sea and then lost an average of 0.40% -0.80% of the popula- tion per day after that (Parker 1966). Fraser River and central B.C. coastal pink salmon experienced mortali- ties of 90.00% and 81.00% respectively in their first four months of life at sea (Parker 1966; Walters et al. 1978). Mortality rates of both hatchery and wild fishwere varied by \u00b110% to examine the effects on con- sumption (Table 4). Period modeled The model was initially run for 93 d from May 1 to August 1, 1998. May 1 is the approximate median date that fish are released from PWS hatcheries. Pink salmon were found to move out onto the GOA shelf beginning at least in mid-July, but can still be found near PWS on the shelf in October (Boldt 2001); therefore, August 1 was chosen as an approximate end date of pink salmon residence in PWS. For sensitivity analy- ses, the number of days modeled was altered by \u00b110 d (83 and 103 d) to examine the effect on consumption (Table 4). The model was also run for 120 d, the num- ber of days that has been previously reported as the residence time of pink salmon in PWS (Cooney and Brodeur 1998; Table 4). The values used for water temperature, diet of fish, prey energy density, and predator energy density for the three models were the same as those used on day 93 of the original model. The same growth rate utilized in the 93 d model was utilized to estimate a final fish weight for days 83, 103, and 120, as 6.5 g, 14.2 g, and 27.7 g, respectively. A mortality rate of 69.00% was utilized for the first 40 d modeled. A mortality rate of 0.60%/d was utilized after day 40, and resulted in mortality estimates of 22.4%, 31.1%, and 37.8% for days 83, 103, and 120, respectively.Table 4.

Weingartner, University of Alaska Fairbanks, personal communicationhRoyer and Weingartner 2001118 Articles RESULTS The estimated consumption by a juvenile pink salmon cohort during its first three months at sea was 5.5\u00d7109 g wet weight or 27.9 g wet weight of prey per individual fish (Table 5). Large calanoid copepods, larvaceans, and cladocerans comprised the majority of pink salmon prey, representing 40.1%, 24.3%, and 12.5 %, respec- tively, of the total prey biomass consumed. The consumption estimate was affected differen- tially by varying fish diet and fish energy content (Table 5). If pink salmon consumed prey of low energy den- sity, such as barnacle nauplii, consumption estimates increased by 68%, whereas, if pink salmon consumed high energy prey, such as insects, consumption esti- mates decreased by 28% (Table 5). If pink salmon energy content decreased from 4.1 to 3.9 kJ/g wet weight as was measured at the time of release and in mid-July, the consumption estimate was 4% lower (Table 5). Varying the temperature regime by \u00b12\u00b0C altered the estimate of consumption. Compared to the originalestimates, consumption estimates were 10% higher (6.1\u00d7109 g) for warmer temperatures and 8% lower (5.1\u00d7109 g) for cooler temperatures (Table 5). Utiliza- tion of the daily mooring temperature data from GAK 1 in the north GOA resulted in very little change in the original consumption estimate. The consumption esti- mate based on the mooring temperature data was 2% lower than that of the original model (Table 5). This estimate falls within the range of consumption estimates calculated using the minimum and maximum tempera- ture regimes. Wild pink salmon consumption represented 27.6% of the consumption in the original model. When wild pink salmon survival was altered by \u00b110%, the overall con- sumption in PWS changed by \u00b1 2% (Table 5). Increased fry-to-adult survival rates of wild fish compared to hatchery fish resulted in fewer wild fry entering PWS. Overall consumption by juvenile pink salmon in PWS was, therefore, reduced when fewer wild pink salmon entered PWS (Table 5).

Varying the mor- tality rate of pink salmon by \u00b110% resulted in a \u00b121% change in the estimated consumption (Table 5). Varying pink salmon residence time in PWS also affected consumption estimates. The model was run for 83 d, 103 d, and 120 d, assuming a constant growth rate of 4% body weight per day. Compared to the 93 d model, the consumption estimate for the 83 d model was 30% lower. If pink salmon residence time in PWS was 103 d or 120 d consumption would be 30% or 162% higher, respectively (Table 5). DISCUSSION The bioenergetics model has over 25 parameters and input values that could affect the estimates of consump- tion. In this study, sensitivity analyses on model inputs, such as prey and predator energy content, temperature, pink salmon numbers, mortality, diet, and model dura- tion, resulted in consumption estimates that ranged from -30% to +162% of the original estimate. Altering fish diet, mortality rate, and model duration had the largest effects on the consumption estimates. Pink salmon consumption estimates reflect seasonal changes in zooplankton composition. Large calanoid copepods were consumed in May whereas in June and July, larvaceans and cladocerans were major compo- nents of the diet. Small calanoid copepods comprise the majority of zooplankton numbers and biomass in the upper 50 m of PWS in all months (Cooney et al. 2001). The density and biomass of large calanoid copepods,such as Neocalanus spp. and Calanus marshallae , increase in May and June, and decrease by July and August, when pteropods, larvaceans, and cladocerans become more important components of the zooplank- ton (Cooney et al. 2001). Pink salmon diet is affected by these seasonal changes in zooplankton availability as well as by geographic location and year (Willette et al. 1997; Landingham et al. 1998; Boldt 2001) and this alters the estimated consumption of zooplankton. When pink salmon consume low calorie prey items, such as bivalves, barnacles, and amphipods, they must satisfy energetic demands by consuming more prey. When pink salmon consume high energy prey items, such as fish and insects, consumption estimates decrease. A low energy diet resulted in a 68% higher consumption esti- mate whereas a high energy diet resulted in a 28% lower consumption estimate. The energy content and condition of juvenile pink salmon can vary geographically (Parker and Massa 1993; Perry et al. 1996; Paul 1997; Boldt 2001); how- ever, there was not enough data available to examine spatial differences in consumption. We used an aver- age pink salmon energy content of 4.171 kJ/g wet weight in the model, a value within the range (3.2-5.2 kJ/g wet weight) found for PWS pink salmon between May 31- June 2 (Paul 1997). Variables known to affect the con- dition and energy content of fish include temperature, salinity, interspecific and intraspecific competition, and the types of prey consumed (Brett et al. 1969; Smith et al. 1986; Parrish and Mallicoate 1995). Pink salmon consumption is affected by water tem- perature (Brett et al. 1969) and zooplankton availabil-Table 5. Consumption of zooplankton by juvenile pink salmon in Prince William Sound (PWS).

Temperature not only affects the amount of food salmon consume, it also affects their emigration timing from natal streams (Simenstad and Salo 1982; Cooney et al. 1995; Mortensen et al. 2000). During cold years, pink salmon fry emigrate later than in warmer years in PWS (Cooney et al. 1995). The earlier emigration of pink salmon fry in warmer years corresponds closely with the zooplankton peak, which typically occurs in May (Cooney et al. 1995); therefore, temperature determines whether pink salmon enter PWS at a time during peak or declining zooplankton biomass. Varying water temperature in the model changed consumption estimates by -8% to +10 %. Currents may also affect pink salmon residence time in PWS and, therefore, the final weight of pink salmon and their consumption of zooplankton (Cooney et al. 1981). Longer residence times resulted in a larger final fish weight and an increased consumption by pink salmon. Part of the westward flowing Alaska Coastal Current (ACC) of the north GOA flows into Prince Wil- liam Sound through Hinchinbrook Entrance and out the southwest part of the sound (Royer et al. 1990; Niebauer et al. 1994). The amount of the ACC enter- ing PWS varies with year and season (Royer et al. 1990). Pink salmon are thought to follow the ACC cur- rent; therefore, the amount of flow into and out of PWS may affect pink salmon residence time. The survival rates of wild pink salmon are difficult to determine, and are probably not the same as for hatchery fish. We back-calculated the number of wild fry entering PWS from the number of returning adults using hatchery survival rates. If wild salmon survival rates were actually higher than those of hatchery salmon, fewer wild salmon would have entered PWS, resulting in decreased consumption estimates. Similarly, changes in mortality within the 93 d model period would also change consumption estimates, with higher mor- tality rates decreasing consumption estimates. The model indicates a pink salmon that grows from 0.26 to 9.60 g wet weight in 93 d in PWS would con- sume 27.9 g of wet weight in prey, an amount less than Cooney's (1993) estimate for pink salmon that reside in PWS for four months (36.4 g). The population con- sumption estimate in this study ranged from 3.9\u00d7109 (short residence time in PWS) to 9.3\u00d7109 (low calorie diet) g wet weight or 0.037 -0.089 g C/m2. Cooney (1993) estimated that million sur- viving and 829 million non-surviving salmon would be about 45.9\u00d7109 g wet weight, which is about five times higher than the estimate in this study. Disparities between consumption estimates in this study and Cooney's (1993) study are due to differing assumptions made about residence time, pink salmonnumbers, mortality, and gross growth efficiencies. Cooney (1993) assumed that pink salmon reside in PWS for 4 months, whereas, in this study, the model was run for only 3 months (93 d). Increasing the residence time of pink salmon in PWS in the bioenergetics model re- sulted in an increased estimate of consumption, assum- ing that fish continue to grow at the same rate. If pink salmon resided in PWS for 120 d and grew to 27.67 g, they could potentially consume 162% (14.5\u00d7109 g wet weight) more zooplankton than if they resided there for 93 d and grew to 9.6 g. This estimate of consumption is 3.3 times lower than Cooney's (1993) estimate. Cooney (1993) assumed there were 1.2 billion hatchery and wild salmon entering PWS, an estimate almost double the estimate utilized in this study (0.67 billion). Also, Cooney (1993) applied all the mortality at the halfway point of residence time, while the bioener- getics approach used in this study applied a daily mor- tality. Additionally, the mortality rate used in this study was higher than that of Cooney (1993); he estimated that 62.7% of hatchery fry and 78.0% of wild fry would be lost to predation. The bioenergetics model was run separately for hatchery and wild fish utilizing the same population numbers and mortality estimates as Cooney (1993). The resultant consumption estimate of wild and hatchery fish (initial weight of 0.25 g and final weight of 9.1 g) over 120 d was 17.2\u00d7109 g wet weight, which is much lower than Cooney's (1993) estimate of 45.9\u00d7109 g wet weight. Another source of disparities between the two studies is that Cooney (1993) assumed a gross growth efficiency of 25%, whereas the model used in this study determines consumption based on data input. The ad- vantages of the bioenergetics model over the use of a single gross growth efficiency are that estimates of consumption are calculated on a daily basis, while ac- counting for water temperature, metabolism, fish weight, prey energy density, fish diet, egestion, and excretion. The importance of consumption estimates can be appreciated by comparing them to the amount of pro- duction that is available. Sanger (1972) estimated that throughout their life cycle, pink salmon consume 1.03% of the annual zooplankton production in the North Pa- cific. Primary production in a typical nontropical, coastal shelf area, such as PWS, is about 100 to 300 g C/m2/ year (Ryther 1969; Jones 1984; Pauly and Christensen 1995). Assuming a transfer efficiency of 20%, second- ary production would be approximately 20 to 60 g C/ m2/year (Jones 1984). This range of values is consis- tent with estimates of zooplankton production on the GOA shelf and coastal areas of 30-60 g C/m2/year (Cooney 1988). Consumption by juvenile pink salmon would represent about 0.06 to 0.45% of this gross es-121 A Bioenergetics Approach to Estimating Consumption of Zooplankton Boldt and Haldorson timate of secondary production, depending on residence time and diet in PWS. A more detailed examination of zooplankton con- sumption indicates that pink salmon are consuming a small proportion of the available standing stock of cla- docerans and larvaceans, but a substantial proportion of the standing stock of large calanoid copepods. Data from vertically hauled bongo net (20 cm diameter, 243 mm mesh) stations where pink salmon were captured were available from July 14 -20, 1998 (Purcell 2000; Table 6). Assuming that these plankton samples are representative of typical plankton composition available to the pink salmon, comparisons to the consumption estimates can be made. The average daily consump- tion of large calanoid copepods during this period was g C/m2, or 1.51% of the large calanoid cope- pods available (Table 6). If it is assumed the standing stock of large calanoid copepods remains fixed for 10 d, pink salmon could consume about 15% of the avail- able copepods. The average daily consumption was 0.23, 1.97, and 1.63\u00d710-4 g C/m2, representing the amphipods, cladocerans, and larvaceans, respectively (Table 6). If the standing stocks of these prey groups were fixed over a 10-day period, pink salmon would consume up to 19.10 % of the am- phipods, 4.50% of the cladocerans, and 0.46% of the larvaceans. Juvenile coho and chinook salmon on the Washington and Oregon shelf also consumed high per- centages of individual prey, such as fish and pteropods (Brodeur et al. 1992). The estimates of consumption derived here for PWS assume that primary and secondary production and pink salmon are distributed evenly throughout PWS and the time period modeled. However, juvenile pink salmon only reside in PWS for 3 to 4 months and they may not be using the entire sound since aggregations of juveniles are found in bays and nearshore areas (Cooney et al. 1978). The concentration of fish in nearshore areas may result in localized depletion of food resources, and al- ter the amount of energy consumed by pink salmon (Cooney et al. 1978; Paul 1997). The zooplanktonsamples taken in PWS were integrated from 60 m depth to the surface and collected at night, whereas, the pink salmon were collected in the day. It is likely that not all zooplankton were available to the juvenile pink salmon since juvenile salmon are thought to occupy surface waters (Moulton 1997). Water column structure may also determine the availability of zooplankton to pink salmon. In areas of strong stratification, zooplankton may be concentrated in the upper layer and, therefore, be available to pink salmon. In areas of weak stratifi- cation, zooplankton may be more evenly distributed in the water column and hence less available to pink salmon juveniles. If pink salmon reside in only a 100 m wide area along the shorelines of PWS, an area of 3.2\u00d7108 m2 (Cooney et al. 1978), the proportion of zoop- lankton they consume would be considerably higher, 1.15% to 8.28% of the secondary production within that area. To determine if pink salmon have reached the car- rying capacity of PWS, local processes that affect zoop- lankton and fish distribution, as well as the presence of potential competitors would need to be considered. For example, other zooplanktivores, such as sand lance, herring, juvenile walleye pollock, juvenile chum and sockeye salmon, and jellyfish in PWS occupy the same areas at comparable times and consume similar prey as juvenile pink salmon (Boldt 1997; et al. 2001). The energy content of both her- ring and pink salmon can vary among locations within PWS, indicating that growth conditions vary geographi- cally (Boldt 2001; Norcross et al. 2001). Fish planktivory, zooplankton availability, and water column structure may result in food limitation in local bays re- ducing the growth and survival of pink salmon result- ing in poor fish condition and low energy content (Cooney et al. 1981; Paul 1997). Planktivory in the open ocean rather than in coastal areas could have resulted in the observed decrease in salmon body weight after the mid-1970s regime shift. Cooney and Brodeur (1998) estimated that pink salmonTable 6. Estimates of zooplankton density (Purcell 2000), standing stock, and pink salmon consumption, assuming the area of Prince William Sound (PWS) is 8.8\u00d7109 m2 (Grant and Higgens 1910), and a carbon to wet weight conversion factor of 0.0898 for large calanoid copepods, 0.0949 for amphipods, cladoceran 2001), and larvacean (K. Coyle, University of Alaska Fairbanks, personal communication) weights are shown. Density Wet weight Standing stock Pink salmon consumption Prey (#/m2) (\u00d710-3g) (g C/m2) (% increased three-fold after 1988 (from pre- 1976 conditions) and most consumption took place in the open ocean. There is some evidence that planktivory by pink salmon can affect zooplankton abundance in the subarctic North Pacific (Shiomoto et al. 1997). Additionally, Russian sockeye salmon were smaller in years when pink salmon were abundant, suggesting competition for zooplankton resources can occur in the open ocean (Bugaev et al. 2001). Also, decreased food availability in combination with the higher sea surface temperatures of this period may have affected the growth rate of the salmon. Brett et al. (1969) observed that optimal sockeye salmon growth occurred at lower temperatures combined with lower food rations. Higher temperatures after the regime shift may have caused increased metabolism and energy requirements ofsalmon and, therefore, decreased weight of the salmon, despite increased zooplankton biomass. This study indicates that juvenile pink salmon did not consume a large proportion of zooplankton biom- ass or production in PWS. Even when the model input data was varied, pink salmon consumption represented only a minor proportion of the available zooplankton. If standing stocks of zooplankton are assumed to be fixed over periods of 10 days, however, consumption by ju- venile pink salmon could represent a substantial por- tion (up to 19%) of some zooplankton, such as large calanoid copepods and amphipods. When examining carrying capacity, consumption by pink salmon needs to be considered along with other planktivores and geo- graphic and interannual variability in zooplankton bio- mass and productivity, since pink salmon represent only one, albeit important, component of the PWS ecosystem.
