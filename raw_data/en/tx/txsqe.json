Why GPS Tox? Most of us have ingested chemicals, pesticides and glyphosate unknowingly through consumption of tainted crops and water. GPS Tox helps to detoxify these harmful chemicals from our stored tissues. Adequate drainage using homeopathic Drainage Milieu and/or the Lymph BioToxicosis remedies is often recommended for clinical success with any of the detoxifier homaccords. Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum herbicide found in Roundup, Rodeo, and Pondmaster and over 750 products. It is applied to the leaves of plants to kill both broadleaf plants and grasses. The sodium salt form of glyphosate is used to regulate plant growth and ripen specific crops. Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in North America although banned in several countries worldwide. It was originally produced by Monsanto, which Bayer acquired in 2018. Bayer was caught up in litigation over Roundup as a result of its 2018 takeover of Monsanto for about $63 billion, which made it the world's largest supplier of seeds and pesticides. Obstacles to Cure Glyphosate-based herbicide are toxic and act as an \"endocrine disruptor\" in the human body. This endocrine disruptor can cause microbiome damage which disrupts cellular communication pathways leading to immune system dysfunction. This may create a loss of immune intolerance, symptoms of EBV, allergies, Lyme, RV (retroviral) activation etc. Neurologically, because of the gut-brain axis, this change in dysbiosis can also lead to neurological dysfunction. Links between glyphosate and a broader range of health challenges has been suggested including ADHD, autism, etc. The liver's phases of detoxification consist of Phase 1, primarily involving cytochrome enzymes which act as a setup for final elimination, and Phase 2. Glyphosate has been shown to disrupt gut bacteria and inhibit the cytochrome enzymes of Phase 1, thus suppressing our ability to detoxify harmful chemicals, contributing modern day diseases.
