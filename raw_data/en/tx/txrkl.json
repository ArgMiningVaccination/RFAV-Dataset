U. S. Postage paid New Haven, CT Permit No. 526 Three years after Yale College joined with the Connecticut Medical Society to establish the Medical Institution of Yale College by an Act of the Legislature, thirty-seven Students are soon arriving in New-Haven from all corners of New England to commence studies in Medicine , Anatomy , Chemistry , and Materia Medica at the new school. Seventeen members of the class come from Connecticut; the rest come from Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. The Students, whose names, towns, and places of residence in New-Haven are listed here, met the requirement for admission, to \"produce satisfactory evidence of a blameless life and conversation.\" The new Medical Institution has a most illustrious and accomplished faculty, assembled by Dr. Timo Thy Dwigh T, the President of Yale College. Dr. N aThan SmiTh, late of Hanover, New Hampshire, where he founded the Medical School at Dartmouth College, is known throughout New England as one of our finest doctors and surgeons. Dr. Smith has a medical degree from Harvard College, and has engaged in additional study in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and London. Dr. B enjamin Silliman is professor of chemistry and of natural history at Yale College, where he has outfitted and equipped a most remarkable Laboratory. Dr. Silliman's Laboratory includes the famous Cabinet of Minerals donated to Yale College by Col. George Gibbs of Newport, Rhode Island, which has placed the College in the forefront of studies of Geology and Mineralogy. Dr. Silliman studied Chemistry for several years in Philadelphia and abroad and also attended medical lectures. Dr. E nea S munSon is well known to all New-Haveners for his successful practice of Medicine and prominence in the government of the town. In 1784, Dr. Munson cofounded the Medical Society of New Haven County and served as its second president. Dr. Munson has played a major role in the formation of the Connecticut Medical Society and was vice president of that organization when it was founded in 1792. He later served as president of the Society from 1794 to 1801. Dr. Munson will be assisted in his teaching by Dr. eli iveS, a master of Botany and of the system of Materia Medica propounded by Dr. John Murray of Edinburgh. Dr. Ives has an especially keen knowledge of our local plants, and he has discovered several new plant species, including species of milkweed and balsamweed, His garden and conservatory at the Medical Institution are filled with plants that he uses to prepare his efficacious Medicines. Dr, jona Than K nigh T, who graduated from Yale College five years ago, studied Medicine in Philadelphia, and his practice in Medicine and Surgery is familiar to many in the town. Dr. Knight will instruct the new Students in Anatomy. The cost to the Students for the full course of Lectures, described further in the Advertisement placed on this page by Dr. Dwight, will be fifty dollars. The course will last six months, with no vacation, and will be given to all thirty-seven Students. During this time, the Medical Professors will perform Surgical Operations, gratis, upon such patients as will consent to be operated upon in presence of the Students of Medicine. Students at the Medical Institution may also attend Lectures at Yale College on Natural Philosophy, Mineralogy, and Geology, and they will enjoy access to the Library of the Academical as well as of the Medical Institution. There is a respectable Anatomical Museum, and every demonstration which is needed in that department will be given. By the Articles of Union Act of the Legislature passed in 1810, to be examined for a license to practice Medicine in Connecticut, a candidate must be 21 years of age, and must have completed three years of apprenticeship with a practitioner of \"respectable standing,\" as well as attend one course of lectures at the Medical Institution. Each candidate for Medical Licensing must also pass an oral examination administered by a board made up of professors from the Medical Institution and members of the Connecticut Medical Society. Students wishing to obtain the m.D. Degree must fulfill those same requirements but must attend two courses of lectures, one of which must be completed at the Medical Institution of Yale College. Most Students have taken rooms in the large stone house at the head of College-street that has been taken by the Medical Institution. Others are lodging elsewhere around the town, including in Mr. Munson's, in the Lyceum\u2014which also houses Dr. Silliman's Chemistry Laboratory\u2014in Mr. Gorham's, hist. library; advertisements: from early american newspapers , an archive of americana collection, published by readex (readex.com) , a division of newsbank, inc.\" 2 www.medicineatyale.orgIn his medical practice, Michael J. Paidas, m.d. , associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and repro - ductive sciences, has a custom that some physicians might find unusual: in his initial consultations with new patients, he provides them with his cell phone number. The compassion and thoughtful - ness that lies behind such gestures are among the reasons Paidas earned this year's David J. Leffell Prize for Clinical Excellence. \"Dr. Paidas has focused on providing excellent, patient-focused Obstetrician honored for superb patient care clinical care,\" said Robert J. Alpern, m.d. , dean and Ensign Professor of Medicine, at the October annual meet - ing of the Yale Medical Group ( ymg), the clinical practice of School of Medi - cine faculty. \"His patients have access to him 24/7. It's faculty like this that make Yale what it is today.\" Paidas, who came to Yale in 2002, is a founding co-director of Yale's Women and Children's Center for Blood Dis - orders, which addresses clotting and bleeding disorders during the repro - ductive, menopausal, fetal, neonatal and geriatric periods of life. Paidas also co-directs the Na - tional Hemophilia Foundation Baxter Clinical Fellow- ship at the School of Medicine. The Leffell Prize was established in 2007 with a dona - tion made by David J. Leffell, m.d. , David Paige Smith Professor of Derma - tology and Surgery and chief executive officer of ymg , and his wife Cindy. Michael Paidas The shifting identities of physicians through time are a scholar's life's work It's only partly a figure of speech to say that John Harley Warner, ph.d. , lives sur - rounded by books. T o meet with him, a visitor first ascends to a second-floor balcony that overlooks the book collec - tion of the School of Medicine's Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Historical Library. Then, a walkway to a door built directly into the stacks opens into Warner's office, which is filled with floor-to-ceiling bookcases of its own. It is a fitting perch for Warner, Avalon Profes - sor of the History of Medicine and chair of the School of Medicine's Section on the History of Medicine. Warner, whose demeanor is also bookish, and is marked by the reserve of many scholars in the humanities, originally planned to become a scientist. But in college, a late-night conversation over coffee with a friend about The Two Cultures , British physicist/novelist C.P . Snow's classic 1959 lament on the divide between the sciences and the humani - ties, opened his eyes to a new path. \"'People think about this?'\" Warner recalls asking himself. \"I really hadn't realized that such a field existed.\" He went on to graduate training with Barbara G. Rosenkrantz, ph.d. , professor of the history of science (now emerita) at Harvard University, and became interested in the changing iden - tities of medical practitioners of the 19th century \u2014how were physicians' views of themselves and their profession trans - formed in that rapidly changing world? \"What historians are good at is messiness,\" Warner says. \"In some ways we're better as cultural critics in getting people to ask questions, and to reflect, than we are as boosters.\" These concepts inform much of Warner's research, including his major 1998 work Against the Spirit of System: The French Impulse in Nineteenth- Century American Medicine , which is rooted in the diaries, letters, and clinical notes of young American doctors study - ing medicine in early-1800s Paris \u2014then the center of cutting-edge science \u2014who returned to America armed with new knowledge and perspectives. Generally, Western medicine had inherited \"theoretically complex, very rationalistic\" medical systems from the Enlightenment, Warner says. But in Paris, American doctors saw an oppor - tunity for systematic change that could \"socially and culturally uplift the medical profession in the United States.\" They could now \"ignore things they saw as literally irrelevant, because they didn't have any purchase on the real world,\" instead focusing on the patient at the bedside and at the body at autopsy, and making correlations between the two. \"Observe and describe, don't go beyond that,\" is how Warner describes this new outlook. \"It really is the origin of the American kind of clinical, hospital-based medicine, and the idea that the hospital should be a place for research as well as practice that takes shape as a conse - quence,\" profoundly changing the profes - sion and doctors' identity in the process. Warner is now working on a book- length study of James Jackson Jr., m.d. , a young American doctor who appren - ticed in a Paris hospital in the early 1800s, making use of his \"wonderfully rich\" weekly correspondence with his father, a Harvard professor and one of the founders of Massachusetts General Hospital. Another current research project is a study of the transformations of the hospital patient chart from the 19th to 21st centuries. In this year of the School of Medi - cine's Bicentennial, Warner says, one could argue it is the notion of identity that now sets the medical school apart. Before the 1910s and the philanthropic infusion of funds that made reform pos - sible, Yale's medical school \"resembled a trade school,\" as was typical of American medical schools at the time. And with the establishment in the 1920s of the Yale System of medical education, which respects students' independence , \"Yale took a very brave, controversial, and consequential step,\" he says, to \"treat medical students as adults, as grown-ups, as graduate students \u2014as people who could have an active role in shaping . . . what kind of doctors they became.\"School launches new program in biomedical ethics The School of Medicine is launching a new Program for Biomedical Eth - ics, which will be directed by Mark R. Mercurio, m.d. , m.a. , as- sociate professor of pediatrics. Biomedical ethics is a subject of great interest to students and of increasing importance to medicine, as technological advances and other influences on health care add com - plexity to the decision making of physicians and their colleagues. The new program will coordi - nate and augment the educational and other scholarly work in bio - medical ethics at the medical school, and create international visibility for work in biomedical ethics at Yale through publications, working groups, and other initiatives. The program will provide support to medical students pursuing research in biomedical ethics for their thesis work, and will also assist students in graduate school and postdoctoral training programs. Mercurio, an associate director of Yale's Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, received his m.d. from Columbia University's Col - lege of Physicians and Surgeons in 1982 and trained at Yale as a resident and fellow. An accom - plished neonatologist, he received his master's degree in philosophy from Brown University in 2004 and has for many years taught medical ethics to Yale residents, fellows, and medical students.

We regret the error.a department that was strong, and made it even stronger.\" Recent research by Elias and colleagues has shed important insights into asthma. In a 2007 article in the New Eng - land Journal of Medicine (nejm ), Elias and Geoffrey L. Chupp, m.d. , associate professor of medicine and director of the Yale Center for Asth - ma and Airway Disease, reported that asthmatic patients have high levels of the protein ykl-40, which helps to regulate the immune response and causes lung inflammation associated with asthma. In a 2008 nejm article, Elias, Chupp, and colleagues showed that people who have a particular version of the ykl-40 gene are at greater risk of getting asthma. Their work has led to a better understand - ing of asthma, and provided new targets for the development of novel treatments for the disease. Elias received his undergraduate and medical degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and was an intern and resident at Tufts-New England Medi - cal Center in Boston. He returned to the University of Pennsylvania as a senior resident and completed fellowships there in both allergy and immunology and in cardiovascular-pulmonary medicine. He came to Yale in 1990 as professor and chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine. Elias has been a member of the aap since 1998 and a councilor since 2003. The group has about 1,000 active members as well as 550 emeritus and honorary members, including 33 members of the Yale faculty. and three brothers. Sponsored by a church in Brooklyn, N.Y., the family lived in the parish house, and young Keggi, at age 15, worked as a bellboy at Brooklyn's St. George Hotel. After attending three high schools in New York, Keggi ended up at the Bruns - wick School in Greenwich, Conn. From there he came to Yale College, graduating in 1955.Keggi applied for admission to Yale School of Medicine, and was slightly in - timidated to be interviewed by Dorothy M. Horstmann, m.d., a legendary fac - ulty member whose research during the 1940s had provided a basis for the vac - cine against polio. \"Much to my surprise they accepted me,\" Keggi has said. \"My performance in organic chemistry hadn't been that stellar.\"tissue trauma and less risk of infection than conventional approaches, and promotes quicker recovery, getting pa - tients back on their feet more quickly. Over the past three decades Keggi and colleagues he has trained at Yale and at Waterbury Hospital in Waterbury, Conn., have performed over 6,000 hip-replacement surgeries using this general approach, and have seen significantly fewer com - plications, shorter operative times, low blood loss, and a more appealing post-operative appearance. In addition to his work in the oper - ating room, Keggi has made a lasting contribution to medical education as the founder and president of the Keggi Orthopaedic Foundation ( kof). Since its launch in 1988, kof has provided fellowships in advanced orthopaedic surgery at the School of Medicine and at Waterbury Hospital for more than 300 surgeons from the Baltic nations, Russia, and Vietnam. A native of Latvia, Keggi came to the United States with his family when he was 15. \"We had a dollar among us,\" Keggi said in a 2009 interview, referring to his parents Joint-replacement innovator's medical education foundation has had a worldwide impact On September 23, a festive crowd of colleagues, family members, and friends filled the medical school's Historical Li - brary for a reception to celebrate the ap - pointment of surgeon Kristaps J. Keggi, m.d. , as the inaugural Elihu Professor of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation. Many of those present had contribut - ed directly to the creation of the new pro - fessorship, which was established with the combined contributions of a number of corporate and individual donors. The professorship will serve as the cornerstone of a Joint Reconstruc - tion Program being established at the School of Medicine as a center of excellence in clinical care, research, and medical education and training. Keggi is internationally renowned for his work as an orthopaedic surgeon specializing in hip and knee replace - ments. In particular, he pioneered and has continually refined a minimally in - vasive approach to hip replacement that relies on a single \"mini-incision\" only eight to 10 centimeters long, sometimes combined with one or two additional tiny incisions to accommodate surgical instruments.

One of the most prestigious and selective medical societies, the aap was founded in 1885 by Sir William Osler, m.d. , a major figure in medical history, and six other physicians for \"the advancement of scien - tific and practical medicine.\" Elias, the Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Professor of Medicine and chair of the Department of Medicine, studies the cellular and molecular biology of processes related to both injury and repair in the lungs in asthma, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute lung injury. His research group has developed and studied genetic models of these diseases and translated findings from this work to their human counterparts, work that has validated therapeutic targets for new therapies for these conditions. \"To be president of the aap is, needless to say, a very great honor,\" says Dean and Ensign Professor of Medicine Robert J. Alpern, m.d. \"This really attests to Jack's reputation among the leaders of academic medicine, nationally and probably internationally.\" Elias became chair of Yale's Department of Inter - nal Medicine in 2006. He is board certified in internal medicine, pulmonary disease, allergy and immunol - ogy, and critical care medicine. \"Jack's research in pulmonary medicine has really led the field and has spanned all the way from very basic science to clinical research, where his basic science is leading to new treatments for pulmonary disease,\" says Alpern. \"As chair of internal medicine, he's re - cruited a number of outstanding faculty.

The most direct way to support outstanding faculty such as Kristaps Keggi, the new Elihu Professor of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation profiled on this page, is through the establishment of endowed professorships, which supply a substantial and reliable flow of funds to support a professor's teaching and research activities. Equally important, when a current or newly recruited faculty member is appointed to a named chair, it signals Yale's high regard for that scholar, our confidence in that individual's intellect, creativity and drive, as well as our lasting commitment to his or her area of expertise. Endowed chairs thus serve as a powerful means for Yale School of Medicine to attract the best people and keep them working here. The named professorship stands among the highest honors Yale University can bestow, and once appointed, a professor retains that position for the remainder of his or her career at Yale. The endowed professorship also ensures that the donor's name and particular interests are advanced in perpetuity.

Medicine @Yale November 2010 34 www.medicineatyale.org The Medical Institution of Yale College is born Articles of Union that bound Yale College and the Connecticut Medical Society together in the creation of the Medical Institution of Yale College were signed in 1810, but preparations delayed the school's opening until November 1813. The first medical school in Connecticut and the sixth in the United States, the Medical Institution initially drew students primarily from Connecticut and the New England region. In the school's earliest years, a faculty of five taught just five courses: Theory and Practice of Medicine; Surgery and Midwifery; Anatomy; Chemistry, Pharmacy, and Mineralogy; and Materia Medica (which mainly covered the use and preparation of medicinal plants). For those who wished to practice medicine, the school offered a level of formal training that went beyond the traditional apprenticeship system, the most common form of medical training in America in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The Medical Institution also provided an educational solution for those unable or unwilling to train abroad or at one of the handful of other medical schools in the United States, the oldest of which were located in Philadelphia and New York.1810-1835 A fledgling medical school gains a surer footing The Medical Institution had many successes in its first decades, but by mid-century the increasing professionalization of medicine forced attendant changes in medical education. Yale, like many other American medical schools, struggled to make its curriculum requirements more stringent while maintaining student enrollment. The school continued to be run jointly by the Connecticut Medical Society (which had the deciding vote in terms of governance) and by Yale faculty (which included the professors of Yale College as well as the Medical Institution). In 1845, the election of Charles Hooker , m.d. , as dean of the Medical Institution marked the first appointment of a dean at any of Yale's graduate schools. Cortlandt Van Rensselaer Creed, m.d. , became the first African American to earn a degree from the Medical Institution when he graduated in 1857. In 1839, the school began to require a thesis for the m.d. degree, a requirement that is still in place today. (The oldest extant bound thesis written by a Yale medical student, entitled De Calculo Vesicae, is focused on bladder stones, and dates to 1837.) 1836-1860 The Civil War, and a new ideal in American medical education During the Civil War, the staff of the Knight U.S. Army General Hospital in New Haven, under the direction of Pliny Jewett, m.d. , an 1840 graduate of the Medical Institution, provided care for more than 25,000 wounded Union soldiers. The period following the war proved difficult for the Medical Institution, due not only to the costs wrought by America's bloody internecine struggle, but also to the conditions arising from the changing landscape of American medicine. The school's continued improvement of educational standards and intense competition with the growing number of medical schools in other states decreased student enrollments to the lowest point in its history. Debt mounted and financial problems were nearly constant. A lack of support from Yale College\u2014both financial and institutional\u2014seemed to augur oblivion for the medical school. But this period also marked the first steps toward the new ideal in American medical education\u2014an ideal that rejected the old system of apprenticeship, embraced science rooted in the experimental method, and affirmed the importance of scientific research in medicine.1861-1885 Major advances with the dawn of a new century In 1886, Herbert E. Smith, m.d. , began his second year as dean of the medical school (by then known as the Medical Department of Yale College). It was not an auspicious time to lead the school: Yale's Medical Department had hit bottom in both student enrollment and financial resources. Having studied at the University of Heidelberg, Smith was a proponent of the German approach to medical education, with its heavy emphasis on research. During Smith's years as dean (1885-1910), professor Arthur W. Wright, ph.d. , who in 1861 had been one of three Yale students to receive the first ph.d. degrees conferred in the United States, published the first X-ray image in America . The Medical Department made educational requirements for admission more stringent, lengthened the course of study, and expanded the curriculum to more closely model the German example by emphasizing research and clinical instruction. With clinical education an increasingly important feature of medical education, Smith began the process by which the medical school became intimately connected with the New Haven Hospital (now Yale-New Haven Hospital), as it remains today.1886-1910 years of medicine at Yale connecticut state archives yale school of medicine; photo by carl k aufman and william p. sacco cushing/whitney medical library \u00a92005 by peabody museum of natural history, yale universit y years of medicine at YaleMedicine @Yale November 2010 5 years of medicine at Yale years of medicine at Yale The Flexner Report and the debut of the 'Yale System' The 1910 Flexner report, an unsparing assessment of medical education in America, caused upheaval in medical schools, with many struggling to adapt to the report's recommendations or die: By 1920, nearly half of the 155 schools in North America were gone. At Yale, the report was instead the prelude to a vast transformation. The University made a financial commitment to its medical school unprecedented in its 100-year history. Under the visionary leadership of Dean Milton C. Winternitz, m.d. , the School of Medicine refashioned itself and rose to national prominence. Winternitz outlined the school's modern footprint and instituted the \"Yale System\" of medical education, which prizes students' independence and their original research. A symbol of the new optimism, Sterling Hall of Medicine was dedicated on February 23, 1925. Key funds from the Rockefeller Foundation remade the school's clinical departments, making Yale one of only a few medical schools at the time to adopt the \"full-time\" system, in which faculty received salaries to support themselves without relying on income from private practices.1911-1935 Wartime spurs a national commitment to science The Yale Poliomyelitis Study Unit (ypsu ), formed in 1931, took a community-based approach to unraveling the causes of polio, then an epidemic disease. The ypsu 's John R. Paul, m.d. , and James D. Trask, m.d. , were the first to isolate poliovirus from living patients in several decades, which opened a new stage in polio research. Another ypsu member, Dorothy M. Horstmann, m.d. , made the important discovery that the virus is present in the blood in the disease's early stages, thereby enabling researchers to develop a vaccine for the disease. With America's entry into World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt instituted the Office of Scientific Research and Development (osrd ) to harness research in support of the Allied effort. With osrd support, Louis S. Goodman, m.a. , m.d. , and Alfred Gilman , ph.d. , were studying chemical warfare agents, and serendipitously discovered that nitrogen mustards used in chemical warfare were remarkably good at killing certain cancerous tumors. In 1942, this work led to the first intravenous chemotherapy treatment of a cancer patient, marking the birth of medical oncology.1936-1960 The birth of Medicare, and the rise of molecular biology Following World War II, federal funding for biomedical research exploded, and in 1965, the U.S. government's Medicare program provided millions of Americans lacking health insurance with access to medical care. At the School of Medicine, a huge influx of grants from the National Institutes of Health, combined with a significant increase in clinical income, drove a massive expansion in which existing departments grew and new ones were formed. After Watson and Crick discovered the structure of dna in 1953, medical research was rapidly and utterly transformed by molecular biology, which offered powerful new tools to identify cellular mechanisms at work in health and disease. In 1979, Joan A. Steitz , ph.d. , discovered snrnp s (\"snurps\"), rna-protein complexes in the cell's nucleus that perform a crucial step in the transfer of dna information into messenger rna (mrna). Besides illuminating how m rna is spliced together to create proteins, Steitz's research on snrnp s has thrown new light on autoimmune diseases, and has helped to clarify how splicing lends extra versatility to genes, a process that is essential in the immune system.1961-1985 Laying the groundwork for the medicine of tomorrow The last 20 years have seen breathtaking advances in molecular biology and genetics\u2014most notably the publication of the complete sequence of the human genome in 2001\u2014achievements that promise to lead to important insights into human disease and new, targeted therapies. Today, the ability to quickly and inexpensively sequence complete human genomes heralds the dawn of a long-awaited \"personalized\" approach to medicine, in which a patient's genetic makeup helps to determine optimal treatment strategies. Among the important recent discoveries of School of Medicine faculty is the 1997 publication by Arthur L. Horwich, m.d. , and colleagues of the atomic structure of a molecular protein-folding machine that is essential to normal cell function. Faulty protein folding is a feature of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In 2007, Yale University acquired the 136-acre West Campus. With 20 buildings and over 1.5 million square feet of space, nearly a third of which is devoted to laboratories, West Campus will be home to five new scientific institutes, and state-of-the-art facilities for genomics, gene expression analysis, and drug discovery.1986-2010 adapted from medicine at yale: the first 200 years by kerry l. falvey \u00a92010 by yale universit ycushing/whitney medical library national library of medicine t. charles erickson courtesy of thomas e. ferrin6 www.medicineatyale.orgGrants and contracts awarded to Yale School of Medicine November 2009\u2014February 2010 Federal Karen Anderson , nih, Exploring Novel Targeting Strategies for aids Protozoal Pathogens , 4 years, $1,655,000 Susan Baserga , 4 years, $1,779,285 , nih, Investigating the Mechanisms of Vascular Neotissue Formation in Engineered Tissue , 5 years, years, $409,613 Paul Cleary , nih, National aids Prevention Research Centers Proposed Multi-Level Intervention Planning Workshop , 1 year, $88,835 Marie Egan , nih, cftr and the Immune Response , 5 years, $2,068,750 Barbara Ehrlich , Department of the Army, Strat - egies to Prevent Chemotherapy-Induced Periph - eral Fikrig scapularis, 5 years, $2,068,750 John Hwa , nih, Pharmacogenetics 5 years, $2,068,750 Celina Juliano , nih, Determining piwi Function using in vivo Imaging of Stem Cells in Hydra, 3 years, $143,670 Susan Kaech , nih, iCyt Reflection Kubera , nih, Role of Assembly , 5 years, $2,068,750 Laura Niklason , nih, $2,577,329 Pasko Rakic , nih, Neurogenetic Processes 5 years, $5,406,186 Nancy Ruddle , nih, , $455,125 Kristin Rudenga , nih, Influence of Physiological Significance, Preference, and Stress on Taste Coding , 2 years, $51,210 Gary Rudnick , nih, Neurotransmitter nih, years, $1,758,440 Mark Shlomchik , nih, Mechanisms of Autoimmune Activation and Regulation by Innate Immune Receptors , 5 years, $768,890;

Lin, also profes - sor of cell biology, is a world leader in under - standing the role that bits of genetic material called small rna s play in stem cell biology. Until fairly recently, it was believed that an organism could not pass on changes in gene expression to future generations unless the dna sequence of that organism's genome was somehow altered, usually by mutations. But in recent years, it has become clear that additional mechanisms, known as epigenetic factors, can directly interact with the genome to prevent or enhance gene expression even if the underlying dna sequence remains unchanged. Epigenetic processes have been implicated in congenital dis - eases, cancer, and autoimmune dis - eases, among others. With the new grant, Lin will study how pi rna s, a class of small rna s discovered in his lab, guide epigenetic factors to specific points within the genome. He ultimately hopes to compile information on epi - genetic effects of small rna s in the first \"functional epigenome map.\" Horvath, co-director of the School of Medicine's recently launched Pro - gram in Integrative Cell Signaling and Neurobiology of Metabolism, is an expert on the effects of metabolism on higher brain functions. He has studied Tamas L. Horvath, d.v.m. , ph.d. , chair comparative medicine, and Haifan Lin, ph.d. , director of the Yale Stem Cell Center, have received 2010 Pioneer Awards from the National Institutes of Health ( nih). The Pioneer Awards have been given annually since 2004 to scientists \"of exceptional creativity who propose pioneering\u2014and possibly transform - ing\u2014approaches to major challenges in biomedical and behavioral research.\" In contrast to other nih programs, the Pioneer Award Program aims to support a very small number of ap - plicants. Horvath and Lin were among 17 scientists to be honored this year, and they join just 81 other researchers who have received the Pioneer Award since its creation. Each researcher will receive a $2.5 million grant as well as additional for cancer and other diseases, was acquired last year by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche for about $50 billion.) In gratitude to Yale for helping him start his research career, Boyer gave the School of Medicine $10 million to en - dow the center that was then named in his honor. In a 1995 article on the Boyer Center, Vincent T. Marchesi, m.d. , ph.d. , the Anthony N. Brady Professor of Pathology and professor of cell biol - ogy, wrote, \"The power of [molecular genetics] has already exceeded even the most optimistic expectations.\" Mar - chesi has served as the Boyer Center director since its inception. john and betty anlyan As the new millennium began, there was a pressing need at the medical school for both laboratory space and classrooms. Just up the street, at the corner of Congress Avenue and Cedar Street, construction was taking place on the largest, most expensive build - ing in the School of Medicine's history. With the opening of the Anlyan Center for Medical Research and Education in 2003, research space increased by 25 percent overnight. The building was named in recognition of major donors 'Exceptional creativity' garners NIH award for two researchers John Anlyan, m.d. , a retired cancer surgeon who received his Yale medical degree in 1945, and his wife, Betty. The Anlyans bequeathed their entire estate, estimated to be worth more than $50 million, to the medical school. The $176 million structure, designed by Robert Venturi, was the largest capital project ever undertaken in Yale's history. With 457,000-square-feet of space, the center occupies a full city block. A six-story south wing is devoted to research, including internal medicine, genetics and immunobiology, and is home to about 700 investigators. The three-story education wing on the northern side has innovative facilities for the teaching of anatomy and histol - ogy, plus a 150-seat auditorium. The Anlyan Center also houses the W.M. Keck High Field Magnetic Resonance Research Center.The two wings are linked by a spacious three-story atrium funded by the Starr Foundation. As part of the gift, John Anlyan even in - cluded a collection of his own paintings to brighten the building. joel and joan smilow Artwork also figures heavily into the ambience\u2014and perhaps the healing power\u2014of the newest building at the Tamas Horvath Haifan Lin medical center, Smilow Cancer Hospi - tal at Yale-New Haven, a $467 million, 168-bed hospital in which interdisci - plinary teams of specialists are offering state-of-the-art treatment options for patients with cancer. The 14-story, 500,000 square-foot- hospital, which opened in October 2009, was named in honor of business executive Joel E. Smilow\u2014who gradu - ated from Yale College in 1954 and went on to lead Playtex Products\u2014and his wife, Joan. The Smilows, longtime Yale University benefactors, particularly in athletics, made a major philanthropic gift to help fund the hospital, which is replete with paintings, photographs, and sculpture, large salt-water fish tanks, and an outdoor \"healing gar - den,\" all creating an atmosphere one reporter described as a \"carefully cali - brated calm designed to soothe, allay fears, and encourage hope.\" In a dedication speech, Joel Smilow used the language of business to sum up the value of his gift, the latest in the long line of philanthropic donations for brick-and-mortar projects at the School of Medicine. His gift \"will pay divi - dends every year,\" he said. \"Every year, thousands of patients will benefit.\"neuroendocrine aspects of neurodegen - erative diseases, and his research has also provided insight into metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes\u2014his lab was the first to provide evidence that the brain uses fat as fuel. Horvath has proposed that a small set of cells in the brain's hypothalamus known as AgRP neurons are master regulators of energy utilization in all the body's tissues. With his Pioneer Award, he will study how AgRP regulation of the cellular energy metabolism of various tissues affects the health and longevity of those tissues, and thus the life span of the entire organism. Perturbations in AgRP function could contribute to many of late-onset chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, diabetes, car - diovascular disorders and cancer. After earning his medical degree in 1959, he completed residencies at the Roosevelt Hospital in New York and at Yale. Keggi then served in a U.S. Army mash unit in Vietnam, as chief of orthopaedic surgery at Third Surgical Hospital. His treatment of wounded soldiers there prompted him to develop novel techniques for the treat - ment of traumatic injuries. He returned to Yale as an assistant professor in 1966 to work in ortho - paedic trauma surgery and emergency care. Keggi was appointed clinical professor of orthopaedics and rehabili - tation in 1989 and became professor in the Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation in 2008. At Yale, Keggi took part in the launch of both the Physician Associ - ate Program and the trauma program in the Department of Surgery. He also helped establish the Keggi-Ber - zins Latvian Baltic Studies Fund at Yale University, as well as the Baltic Internship Program for the Yale University Library's Slavic and East European Collections. In the course of his long career, Keggi has earned many honors. He is a six-time winner of the Yale Ortho - paedic Teaching Award. In 2005, he received the George Herbert Walker Bush Lifetime of Leadership Award from Yale University Athletics. He is the recipient of Latvia's Karlis Ulmanis Medal, the Latvian Order of the Three Stars, and the Knights of Lithuania Friend of Lithuania Award.

Thirty or 40 years ago we delivered half of them.\" terry dagradi8 www.medicineatyale.org Throughout the School of Medicine's 200-year history, innumerable indi - viduals have helped shape the institu - tion. But a handful of people have actually built the school in an almost literal sense by providing major gifts to the medical school to construct the landmark buildings that today bear those donors' names. john william sterling The Sterling Hall of Medicine, dedicated in 1925, is named in honor of philanthropist John William Sterling (1844-1918), a New York City corpo - rate attorney who graduated from Yale College in 1864, amassed a substantial fortune advising the likes of Standard Oil and the National City Bank of New York, and left the bulk of it, $18 million, to Yale University. In his will, Sterling requested that some of the money be used to build \"at least one enduring, useful, and architecturally beautiful edifice.\" His wish was fulfilled, and then some: to - day, seven campus buildings carry the Sterling name, along with the profes - sorships that are among Yale's highest academic honors, and numerous schol - arships, programs, and collections. A graceful Renaissance Revival structure at 333 Cedar Street, Sterling Hall was funded initially with about $1.3 million from the Sterling bequest. In a 1991 history, the late Yale neuro - surgeon William F. Collins Jr., m.d. , called it the medical school's \"geo - graphical and spiritual center.\" The sprawling building, which included administrative offices, a li - brary, and state-of-the-art laboratories, helped bring most of Yale's far-flung medical operations under one roof in a location close to New Haven Hospital. The Sterling Hall of Medicine, wrote Collins, stands as \"enduring evidence of the beginning of the modern era of medicine at Yale.\" nicholas brady Sterling Hall had distinguished compa - ny just across Cedar Street. In 1913, the medical school had secured a $625,000 grant from the Anthony M. Brady Foun - dation to build the first stage of the labo - ratory complex now known as the Brady Memorial Laboratory. Anthony Brady (1841-1913) was a wealthy industrialist who collaborated with Thomas Edison and others to create key components of mass transit, automotive technology, and lighting systems for cities such as New York, Albany, Washington, D.C., and Paris, France. Brady added to his fortune through astute investments in tobacco companies. Brady's son Nicholas, a philanthro - pist who graduated from Yale College in 1899, was instrumental in convincing his family's foundation to provide a gift to the School of Medicine in honor of his father. The building, completed in 1918, provided headquarters and lab space for the departments of pathology and bacteriology, \"pathological chemistry,\" obstetrics and gynecology, and internal medicine. According to a 1999 history by cardiologist and School of Medicine alumnus Jordan M. Prutkin, m.d. , \"the most important utilization of space in this new building was for the routine laboratory work of the hospital.\" Thus, the Brady building helped to \"integrate the hospital and medical school,\" some - thing then-dean George Blumer, m.d. , and Abraham Flexner, whose landmark 1910 report set the agenda for Ameri - can academic medicine, considered an \"absolute requirement.\" The People Behind the Plaques edward harkness Even though the Brady Laboratory included dormitories after it was ex - panded in the late 1920s, by mid-cen - tury the demand for student housing greatly exceeded the available space. In an address to medical school alumni in 1953, Yale University president A. Whitney Griswold, ph.d. , noted, \"students [were] scattered all over the city, in makeshift housing arrange - ments that imposed an unfair handicap on our medical school in competition with other leading schools.\" In the same speech, Griswold announced a solution to the housing dilemma: a $2.5-million grant to build Edward S. Harkness Memorial Hall, a high-rise structure that would house at least 266 students. Harkness (1874-1940), a member of the Yale College Class of 1897, was an American attorney and philanthropist whose father, Stephen, made his fortune by investing in a venture captained by John D. Rockefeller\u2014a company that would become Standard Oil. Edward Harkness used his inherited wealth to endow numerous non-profit organiza - tions, from Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Many colleges also benefited from Harkness grants, and the Yale University campus was utterly trans - formed by the millions of dollars he and his mother, Anna, provided to build the University's residential college system. The grant for the medical school dormitory came through the Harkness-endowed Commonwealth Fund, and the effect was equally transformative. When it was completed in 1955, E.S. Harkness Hall, which provided hous - ing and dining facilities for single women and men as well as married students, would \"provide those es - sential amenities that take the curse off institutional living and promote the social relationships in which true education flourishes,\" said Griswold. herbert boyer Four decades later, the Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine, with a distinctive C\u00e9sar Pelli-designed fa\u00e7ade that follows the curve of Congress Ave., opened its doors to an interdisciplinary cadre of re - searchers using the new tools of molecu - lar biology to understand a wide array of human disorders, from cancer to heart disease to developmental defects. The new center, dedicated in 1991, was named for Herbert Boyer, ph.d. , a scientist who was a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Medicine from 1963 to 1966. During his days at Yale, which Boyer recalls as a happy and exciting time, he started to develop a genetic engineering technology to splice genes from one organism into another. Several years later, as a professor at the University of California at San Francisco ( ucsf) , Boyer and colleagues patented this methodology, known as recombinant dna , and founded, with about a thousand dollars, a company called Genentech. ( ucsf would eventu - ally reap more than $50 million in royalties from this patent; Genentech, which used recombinant dna tech - niques to mass-produce human insulin and create treatments Major benefactors of School of Medicine building projects in modern times include (clockwise from top) Herbert Boyer, seen here in his University of California laboratory in 1977; Joel Smilow; and Betty and John Anlyan.In the fall of 2001, construction workers put steel girders in place for the Anlyan Center for Medi - cal Research and Education. Occupying an entire city block, the $176 million, 457,000-square-foot structure was the largest capital project ever undertaken in Yale's history. // People (page 7) john curtistime & life pictures/get t "}
