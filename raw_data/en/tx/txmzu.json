So too are the diagnosis and care of many distinct neurological diseases. The velocity of development in neuroscience has been recognized by United States presidents. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush declared the last decade of the 20th century the \"Decade of the Brain.\" Next, in 2013, President Barack Obama announced the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies\u00ae (BRAIN) Initiative with the National Institutes of Health. Likewise, the Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute (INSI) is advancing the field of neuroscience with a multifaceted model of clinical care, research and teaching. INSI brings together board-certified neurological specialists, neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists, therapists, rehabilitation specialists, and scientific researchers. The majority of the Medical Directors of our specialty programs have advanced education and training in more than 25 neurological specialty areas. All of these individuals are experts in their respective neurological subspecialty, focusing on exceptional clinical care to optimize patient outcomes and advance the field of medicine. Their expertise is recognized in the volume of patient visits in our INSI programs, which are comparable to nationally recognized health systems.* The care we provide reaches patients from nearly all 50 states in the nation (44 in 2019*) and a diverse global population. Our patients come to us for our expertise in patient care, therapies, technologies, rehabilitation and surgery. We also offer and host patient community support groups, knowing care can be enhanced with added support for patients and their families. We maintain a steady focus on continuous improvement in patient care, safety and satisfaction, as well as in achievement of strong quality metrics. *Source: HPM hospital-based volumes, 12/2018-11/2019.

In order to become a leading health system, we will continue to work towards being a highly reliable system by embodying our values in all that we do.\" Chapy Venkatsan, MD, MS, FACP Chief Quality and Safety Officer Inova Health SystemSIR (Observed to Expected Ratio)SIR (Observed to Expected Ratio) SIR (Observed to Expected Ratio) 12 | Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 A score of less than 1.0 indicates INSI performance is better than expected based on patient medical condition and risk profile. Readmission data are presented as a ratio of a hospital's observed readmission rate to its expected readmission rate Source: Inova Health SystemPatient Experience We use the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey to measure patients' perspectives of their hospital care at Inova. This standardized gauge allows us to compare our performance with that of other hospitals. Outcomes INSI embraces continuous monitoring of quality outcomes such as complication rates, length of stay, mortality and readmissions. We use internal and external data to provide comparisons and benchmark our results against those of more than 700 hospitals nationwide that are part Premier. From 2016 to 2019, system-wide neurology length of stay, mortality and readmissions consistently outperformed the average Premier client hospital. From 2016 to 2019, system-wide neurosurgery mortality and readmissions consistently outperformed the average Premier client hospital. Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) Patient-reported outcomes, or PROs, assess a patient's health, quality of life, behavior or functional status. Patients submit this information directly, without interpretation by a clinician. Inova uses PROs in our outpatient clinic settings. In 2018, we introduced electronic tablets to automate collection of this data, utilizing REDCap\u00ae technology. Patient Safety All five Inova hospitals were awarded a grade of \"A\" for hospital safety in the fall rankings, 2019 by The Leapfrog Group. Leapfrog recognized Inova's achievements in protecting patients from harm and providing safer healthcare. The Leapfrog Group is a national organization that aims to improve healthcare quality and safety for consumers and purchasers. Leapfrog uses 28 measures of publicly available hospital safety data to assign grades to approximately 2,600 U.S. hospitals twice a year. It is peer reviewed, fully transparent and free to the public. As an organization, we perform exceedingly well with all standardized infection ratios well below the O/E ratio of 1.0. Our exceptional performance on all hospital-associated infections drives our success in external ranking programs. From 2018 to 2019, we experienced more than a 40% reduction in our central line-associated blood system infections (CLABSI), system-wide, which was over 50% fewer than expected, based on patient acuity. From 2018 to 2019, we had a 10% reduction in system-wide catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) with more than 30% fewer than expected. C. diff rates in 2019 continued to hold steady at an estimated 60% fewer than expected. Techniques in Advancing Patient Care Across the Continuum Our Patient and Care Partnership Through Teamwork Inova follows the best possible processes to provide safe, high quality and efficient inpatient care. This is how we do it.Patient Experience, Outcomes and Safety (continued) Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 | 13 Excellence in Nursing The Inova care delivery model calls for physicians, nurses and clinical technicians to function as a team and engage in specific practices that promote and sustain partnerships with patients and their families. The following opportunities for developing nursing excellence through growth include, but are not limited to, professional development council, ADVANCE clinical ladder, Magnet\u00ae designation, continuous education (CE) offerings and annual skills fairs. Multidisciplinary Team Rounds The healing process is a partnership between the patient, family and care team. Open and honest communication allows us to provide opportunities for our patients to discuss or ask questions about their plan of care. All of our hospitals participate in hourly rounding, nurse and physician rounding, and bedside shift-change reporting. Patient and Family Advisory Council (PFAC) Inova values the voice of our patients and families. Each Inova hospital maintains its own Patient and Family Advisory Council (PFAC). The PFAC is dedicated to work in active partnership between former patients and family members and to our Inova-affiliated healthcare providers to create an active partnership to enhance the patient and family experience. Discharge Phone Calls To ensure a seamless transition from the hospital to home, our clinical teams use an evidence-based support process where patients receive post discharge phone calls. During the phone call, the surveyor asks about key areas important in transitioning home, such as follow-up appointments and discharge medications and is able to escalate any further needs identified by the patient or family. Fall Prevention Program By working together, physicians, nurses and hospital staff can lower a patient's risk of injury from falling and make their stay as safe as possible. Our care teams review the safety plan with each patient and family. For patients at high fall risk, we use the AvaSys telesitter program, a visual and audio monitoring platform. In some cases, continuous one-on-one supervision is provided in order to maximize patient safety Nurse Patient Navigation A nurse patient navigator is a key resource in guiding patients through their continuum of care. The navigation process involves integration of patient-specific clinical specialties to ensure ease of care. The nurse navigator is available to assist the patient with answers to their questions, provide education, guide them to the next step in their care and assist in outlining a follow-up plan customized to their needs. The nurse navigator model of care has been a strong feature of several of INSI's programs. Hand Hygiene Campaign Hand hygiene reduces the incidence of healthcare-associated infections. In 2015, Inova began a system-wide hand hygiene campaign to improve hand hygiene compliance through accountability. Each Inova hospital has implemented multiple initiatives to sustain and improve healthcare provider adherence to best practices for reduction of infections, including secret shoppers, improved communication, peer feedback and increased signage. Overall hand hygiene compliance in 2019 was 88%, which exceeded our goal of 85%.Global Issues in Nursing & Healthcare Empirical OutcomesStructural Empowerment New Knowledge , Innovations & ImprovementsTransformational LeadershipExemplary Iqbal, RN Spine Patient Navigator Shrews, RN Epilepsy Patient Navigator 14 | Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 Featured Programs Brain and Spine Tumor Program \"We are committed to providing an accurate and specific diagnosis, communicating all of the patient's treatment options and offering conventional and experimental therapy, with the goal of providing the best care possible with the dignity and respect that everyone deserves. We look forward to assisting your patients in this journey.\"Inova offers neuro-oncology patients highly specialized treatment for all brain and spine tumors, including primary and metastatic, benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous). Inova's Brain and Spine Tumor Program is a unique and comprehensive neuro-oncology treatment program in Northern Virginia and operates as part of the Inova Schar Cancer Institute and INSI. Our goal is to provide excellent patient care through education, expertise and innovation. Our program has on-staff neurosurgeons and neuro-oncologists with advanced fellowship training in the treatment of brain and spine tumors. Our neurosurgeons participate as investigators in national clinical trials to identify new technology and treatment for brain and spine tumor patients. Communication is a vital component of our care structure. We include all members of the care team in the process, starting with the primary care physician. We collaborate with our patients and their families to ensure the best possible outcomes. We use the most advanced technologies and surgical approaches, including CyberKnife\u00ae radiation, laser ablation and surgical navigation with advanced tractography imaging, as well as awake craniotomy and intraoperative mapping of important functions for safe treatment of these tumors. Conditions We Treat We treat a wide range of brain tumors, tumors Pituitary tumors/adenomas Oligodendrogliomas Skull base tumors Mateo Ziu, MD, FAANS Medical Director, Brain and Spine Tumor Program, Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute and Surgical Neuro-Oncology Program, Inova Schar Cancer Institute Spine tumors are abnormal tissue growths within or surrounding the spinal cord. Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor. The most frequently seen spine tumors we treat include: Common benign spine tumors: Aneurysmal bone Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 | 15 Contact Us l Refer a Patient For more information on brain and spine tumor diagnosis, treatment and second opinions, or to schedule an appointment, please call 703.776.4700. In the past 20 years, research has shown in certain spine tumors that surgical intervention combined with radiation therapy is better than radiation alone. In other tumors, surgical intervention may be the only treatment option. Each case is unique, and our surgeons have the advanced training to evaluate and recommend the most appropriate course of action. Treatments There are a number of treatments for brain and spinal cord tumors. Your treatment depends on the type of tumor you have, where it is and your general health. Treatment can consist of: Surgery: Minimally invasive neurosurgery Image-guided minimally invasive laser ablation tools Skull base surgical techniques Brain Tumor Outcomes INSI's brain tumor outcomes for length of stay and mortality consistently performed better than the average Premier client hospitalization. In 2019, more than 70% brain tumor patients were reviewed in a multidisciplinary neuro-oncology conference to meet the AAN quality standard. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) working group identified five areas to drive performance in practice. One of the quality measurement areas includes patients with a multidisciplinary tumor board treatment plan. Since 2017, more than 70% of INSI's brain tumor patients were reviewed in a multidisciplinary neuro-oncology conference to meet this quality standard.

Slipping and falling at home. Injuring yourself at work. Being involved in a motor vehicle accident. These situations, and others, can put people of all ages at risk for concussion, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or other head injuries. Inova offers a comprehensive program to diagnose, manage and treat concussions. Our team includes neuropsychologists, sports medicine physicians, neurologists, physical therapists and athletic trainers, all of whom are focused on the care of the patient. The multidisciplinary team works together to ensure treatment is specifically targeted to the individual. In more complex cases with prolonged symptoms or structural abnormalities, physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, neurologists and neurosurgeons are also involved as part of the team. At INSI, we treat the very mild to the most severe cases. Most mild brain injuries are self-limiting conditions that can be resolved through rest, medical observation and monitoring one's condition. Since the effects of concussion often cannot be seen on MRI scans, CT scans or other neuroimaging, our Brain Injury and Concussion Program focuses on neuropsychological evaluations in diagnosing a concussion. When left undiagnosed, the brain may not have the proper time needed to heal, which can lead to more serious, long-term effects if another head injury is sustained. Our team is specially trained to treat concussions that result from a sports injury, a car accident or other trauma. We Offer Baseline neurocognitive performance testing Concussion education Post injury concussion care 24-hour concussion hotlineMelissa Womble, PhD Medical Director, Inova Sports Medicine and Co-Medical Director, Concussion Program, Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute The program features a physician-based team of experts trained in recognizing the signs and symptoms of concussion quickly to optimize and individualize care, recovery and return to daily activities. We strive to offer all necessary services in one location to make management and treatment as convenient as possible for our patients. In addition to post injury services, our Brain Injury and Concussion Program provides prevention education for athletes, parents and coaches. Inova partners with many local adult and youth sports organizations in concussion education and prevention efforts. We strive to remain at the forefront of care by providing the best management and treatment options for brain injury and concussion. We have developed a research program and concussion registry with more than 500 patients currently enrolled. We believe the clinical database will quickly become one of the most comprehensive in the nation - rivaling other leading concussion clinical and research programs. We had multiple, national presentations at conferences based on data collected from our program in 2019. Data will be used to establish INSI as a leader in concussion clinical care and research. The goal of our research program is to advance the education, assessment, management and treatment of sports-related concussion. Our team is committed to research that leads to improvements in patient care. \"Concussion injury can vary. We are able to help people at any range of concussion from very mild to severe no matter the age of the person affected.\" Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 | 17 The Inova Epilepsy Center is a top-tier program for epilepsy care in the mid-Atlantic region, led by a multidisciplinary team of an epileptologist, neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists, neuroradiologists and interventional radiologists, nurse specialists, EEG technologists, social workers and others with training and experience in epilepsy care.

Surgery can provide a cure from seizures and change the life of an epilepsy patient. Leila Ait Abdedaim's seizures began when she was just five years old. By the time she was in elementary school, they would happen more than ten times a week. Her doctors in her native Morocco were stumped. Her family and relatives thought she might be possessed by demons. Desperate for answers, Leila came to the U.S., where doctors diagnosed epilepsy. Unfortunately, the doctors were unable to control seizures with multiple medication trials. In fact, Leila's seizures got worse. Finally, a seizure episode brought her to the Inova Fairfax Hospital Emergency Room where she got the help she needed. Because the hospital has a level 4 epilepsy center, Leila was able to spend three days in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) where her seizures were recorded and localized. With the help of special monitoring devices, Mohankumar Kurukumbi, MD, the center's Medical Director, was able to pinpoint that all of her seizures were coming from her right temporal lobe. He diagnosed her refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, also known as drug-resistant epilepsy. With her seizures accurately localized, Leila was eligible for a brain resection, which can cure seizures in up to 80 percent of epilepsy patients. Inova neurosurgeon James Leiphart, MD, stepped in to collaborate with Dr. Kurukumbi and performed the right temporal lobe resection. Leila was the first patient to have the procedure at Inova. Afterward, her seizures were gone. INSI's Epilepsy Center is accredited by the National Association of Epilepsy Centers as a level 4 program, which means it provides the highest level of epilepsy care and advanced treatment. Surgical options include surgeries, vagal nerve stimulator, responsive neurostimulation and intracranial electrode monitoring. Patients who qualify for diagnosis and treatment for this type of care can come to Inova. Seizure-free for four and a half years, Leila is a new person. Her result was so positive that she now advocates for other patients in the monthly Epilepsy Support Group, which often features guest speakers. Several of the qualifying patients Leila has interacted with have chosen to follow her footsteps and have elected to have resection surgery, too. About her positive outcome and helping others, Leila says, \"It makes me really happy that other people can feel the same freedom I feel.\" EPILEPSY CASE Meet Leila \"My life has completely changed and I can do anything I want - all without the fear of having a debilitating seizure.\" Leila Ait Abdedaim 20 | Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 Headache Program \"Headaches can be intense and incredibly painful - and they are very common.

DBS is a surgical technique for qualified patients who do not improve with medication. It is an established treatment that involves implanting electrodes within certain areas of the brain. These electrodes produce electrical impulses that regulate abnormal impulses, or the electrical impulses can affect certain cells and chemicals within the brain, which can help lesson symptoms, reduce the use of medications and improve quality of life. A team of experts, including a movement disorder specialist (a neurologist with additional training in Parkinson's disease) and a neurosurgeon conduct an extensive assessment when considering DBS to ensure it is a safe and appropriate option for our patients.

Suffering since her 30's from essential tremor \u2014 an often-inherited chronic trembling of the hands, head or voice \u2014 Karen's medication to treat the movement disorder gradually lost effectiveness. Frustratingly, the Alexandria, Virginia resident couldn't even hand write her annual Christmas cards. \"My grandson would say, 'Grandma, your hand is shaking again,'\" recalls Karen, 58, who vividly remembers her own grandfather's exasperation with the condition when she was a child. \"That really got to me.\" But the burgeoning use of a life-altering technology known as DBS meant that Karen didn't have to settle for her grandfather's fate. Following a three-year ramp-up and $500,000 investment in leading-edge equipment as part of the expanded Inova Parkinson's and Movement Disorders Center, Karen was the first patient at Inova to undergo DBS \u2014 often described as a pacemaker for the brain because it delivers constant electrical pulses to counteract abnormal brain activity \u2014 at Inova four years ago. Since that time, her tremor has not returned, and she has resumed her love of competitive quilting, winning numerous quilting awards. Every visit back to our program is a joyous time reflecting on the activities she can now complete since her tremor is controlled.\"During surgery, I felt completely in control. I knew exactly what was happening.\" Karen Troutman 26 | Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 \"I have been fantastic since the surgery. I move better, I write better, I think better.\" Bachir Flih Parkinson's and Movement Disorders Center (continued) Parkinson's and Movement Disorders Center Patient Living with debilitating Parkinson's disease for 11 years, Bachir Flih wondered if he'd ever find relief. Worsening symptoms made it difficult for him to perform simple, everyday tasks. Worsening depression made him lose interest in everything that once brought joy, including his favorite activity: cooking for his family. Searching for a solution, Bachir's wife Carrie learned of the Inova Parkinson's and Movement Disorders Center. From the moment they stepped through the door, the couple knew they were in good hands. They met with Sean Rogers, MD, PhD, a neurologist and the center's co-founder. \"He was such a breath of fresh air and brought a whole new approach to everything,\" Carrie recalls. Dr. Rogers immediately noticed that Bachir was taking too many medications, which contributed to his depression. He also told him he'd be a good candidate for DBS, which is an established treatment for movement disorders. In this procedure, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain and produces electrical stimulation that blocks abnormal impulses. These electrical stimulations can affect certain cells and chemicals within the brain. There was just one problem. Traditionally, the patient is awake during DBS surgery, so clinicians can get direct feedback on how the stimulation affects the tremors. But because Bachir is claustrophobic, he couldn't tolerate an awake procedure. The team had to come up with some- thing different. Dr. Rogers collaborated with Mahesh Shenai, MD, a neurosurgeon and Director of Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery at Inova Fairfax Hospital to work it out. He and his team strategized to transform the MRI suite into an operating room, so the surgery could be done with Bachir asleep. The breakthrough treatment has brought hope to the world of Parkinson's disease. \"We're excited we now have this opportunity to use MRI-based DBS to benefit so many patients,\" Dr. Rogers says. \"We can provide this wonderful technology to those who need it, but previously were not good candidates because of their inability to tolerate an awake procedure.\" Since his surgery, Bachir is a totally different person. He moves better, writes better and thinks better. He takes less medication and his depression is gone. \"I'm confident enough now to do anything I want,\" he says. \"I'm so happy.\" For Carrie, the difference is night and day. \"I have my husband back; my son has his father back. He's present in the family, where before he was not really interested in being there. It's opened up so many opportunities.

PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMOR CASE Meet Baby M Pediatric Neurosurgery Thankfully, her tumor was benign. She will likely live a long, cancer-free life with normal neurologic function. It doesn't get more critical than facing a brain and spine tumor. After she was seen by an Inova pediatric neurologist, who noted a facial droop that persisted longer than expected, Inova's team of pediatric anesthesiologists shepherded the critically ill child safely through a brain and spine MRI. It revealed a very large brain tumor involving major feeding arteries to the cerebellum and brainstem and surrounding the cranial nerves to her face. The little girl was admitted to the hospital, and her tumor was safely removed in a 10-hour surgery. Specialized care was also at the heart of Baby M's recovery. Highly skilled pediatric nurses took great care of Baby M and her family before transferring her to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in Inova Children's Hospital. Her family knew she was getting the most technologically advanced care possible from a multidisciplinary team of pediatric intensive care, hematology neurosurgery physicians and nurses.Baby M celebrated her first birthday two days before major lifesaving neurosurgery. 36 | Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 The experienced physicians and staff at the Sleep Disorders Program have the expertise to evaluate, diagnose and treat sleep-related problems.

Spine Program Mark Mildorf has always loved being active, doing things like running, hiking and cycling. But he began to be bothered by strange leg pain that came and went: he could easily hike a steep trail in the mountains of Peru one week, and the next week, he would have excruciating pain while walking across the grocery store parking lot. Mark consulted with Corey Wallach, MD, orthopedic surgeon and Medical Director of the Inova Spine Program at Inova Alexandria Hospital and Inova Mount Vernon Hospital. Mark had spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal canal, which was compressing his spinal nerves and causing his symptoms. He also had arthritis in his spine that was beginning to make the spine itself curve, a condition called degenerative scoliosis. But despite these diagnoses, Dr. Wallach did not initially recommend surgery. \"One of the benefits of Inova's spine program is that our spine expertise enables us to provide a thorough workup with appropriate diagnosis, so we can provide the right care and avoid unnecessary surgeries,\" Dr. Wallach said. Dr. Wallach and Mark used a variety of nonsurgical treatments, including conservative care and epidural steroid injections, to treat his symptoms initially. During this time, Mark completed a cycling milestone - his first 100-mile Century Ride - while his back continued to worsen. When the pain was so bad that he thought twice about a simple trip to the coffee shop, Mark decided that the time for surgery had come. There was only one problem - he was training for the Seagull Century, a storied 100-mile bike ride along Maryland's Eastern Shore. Could he do both? Dr. Wallach recommended decompression, removing a portion of the narrowed vertebrae to give the nerves more room. He also recommended a two-level spinal fusion, which would turn three adjacent vertebrae in Mark's lower back into one long, single bone with more stability. Mark decided to have the recommended surgery, which took place at the Inova Mount Vernon Hospital. The surgery went smoothly, and Mark dedicated himself to the recovery process. After about a week, Mark was walking several miles a day without pain. Two months later, he received the all-clear from Dr. Wallach to start training. Mark said. \"Dr. Wallach and Inova did what was right for me. Following his renewed training and exactly 100 days after his surgery, Mark successfully completed the Seagull Century bike ride in Maryland. \"I have a picture in my office of Mark holding his bike over his head in triumph after completing the ride.\" Dr. Wallach said. \"It's very rewarding to see what a positive effect we had on Mark's life.\" AFT_5800.JPG AFT_5804.JPGAFT_5802.JPG AFT_5806.JPGLO REZ PROOF LO PROOFLO REZ PROOF 42 | Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 Stroke and Cerebrovascular Disease Program \"The science of acute stroke care continues to evolve with a common theme: time is brain.

STROKE CASE Meet Barbara Stroke and Cerobrovascular Program Patient Barbara Detrich knew something was terribly wrong. Her 84-year-old mother Sophie, who'd been cheerfully answering TV game show questions, suddenly went quiet. Her eyes were frozen open and her mouth vibrated. Barbara thought Sophie was choking, but paramedics recognized the signs of a stroke. Sophie was rushed to the Inova Fairfax Hospital Emergency Room, where a dedicated neurointerventional team began treatment. A CT scan revealed a large vessel stroke in the dominant hemisphere of her brain. Her condition was so severe that she required a breathing tube to stay alive. Because she had suffered a stroke three months earlier, Sophie could not receive the clot-busting drug tPA. Instead, interventional neuroradiologist Edward Greenberg, MD, and his team performed a mechanical endovascular thrombectomy, an advanced procedure using state-of-the-art equipment to find and remove the clot. With fluoroscopic guidance to see the instruments and arteries in real time, Dr. Greenberg threaded a series of small catheters into the blocked artery in Sophie's brain. He then used two different mechanical techniques to extract the clot: the Penumbra System (a vacuum device) and the Trevo\u00ae Retriever (a specially designed stent). Despite a grim prognosis, Sophie's procedure was a complete success. \"We were able to restore her brain function to normal,\" Dr. Greenberg says. \"One of the most amazing things is that there is no evidence of even a small stroke on the subsequent brain imaging that was performed. So she did indeed escape completely unscathed.\" Nobody was more amazed by the outcome than Barbara, who credits timely action by EMS and the hospital's neurointerventional team with saving her mother's life. \"Everything went like clockwork,\" she says. \"From the time the paramedics arrived at our house to the time the team wheeled her into the operating room, not a single second was lost.\" Following the surgery, Sophie went back home to Springfield, Virginia, where today she is as independent as ever. Both Barbara and Sophie are grateful for the quality of care available so close to home. \"Everyone was top- notch, but also warm, attentive and caring,\" says Barbara. \"It was so reassuring to feel that commitment.

We do this with a multipronged approach for research in the laboratory, clinical trials with our hospital and patients, research via databases and data analytics, and research via devices. We bring together laboratory practices of biochemistry, neuroscience, molecular biology, genomics and advanced data analytics to test hypotheses that address important issues related to clinical practice and patient outcomes.

We collaborate with other academic institutions to share knowledge and research findings as well as to broaden capabilities and contribute with presentations before industry for further collaboration. Research Focus Areas INSI's research began in 2008. Between 2008 and 2019, we helped advance scientific knowledge with over 150 peer-reviewed publications, books and book chapters from clinicians and scientists. More than 250 presentations were shared with colleagues and the Inova community related to a wide range of neuroscience diseases, including aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages, traumatic brain injuries, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and many other neurological disorders in direct association with our areas of study. Research Highlights Pioneering Research for Pretesting Drug Therapies Effectiveness on Brain Tumors: Brain Tumor Lab and Glioblastoma Research Through generous philanthropic support of our Inova community, Kara Foshay, PhD, Research Investigator, Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute, has developed a unique test that is enabling a precision medicine approach to treating brain tumors, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is a deadly tumor. Currently, there are no effective therapies to either prevent or cure GBM. Patients typically have only a few months to live after diagnosis - in spite of the heroic efforts on the part of neurosurgeons and neuro-oncologists. Dr. Foshay's work is based on a novel cell culture method using donated tumor cells. This test uses a biopsy sample from each patient's tumor to grow a cell culture that is unique to that patient. The culture is then used to test various drugs to identify the most effective medication for the particular patient's tumor. It is essentially a \"test tube\" version of the patient. Dr. Foshay is at the early stage of her research using this test on donated tumor cells. If successful, it would allow Inova to address this tragic disease by using a first-of its-kind approach, presenting a unique opportunity for Inova patients and, ultimately, for GBM patients worldwide.Geoffrey Ling, MD, PhD Vice Chair Research Program Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 | 49 Research Combating Neurological Diseases to Ease Human Suffering Genomics, Alzheimer's disease and GRIN2B Alzheimer's disease is a dreaded affliction that affects 5.5 million of Americans. It is projected that by the year 2050, 46 million people will be diagnosed with the disease. There is no cure, prevention or effective treatment to slow it from ultimately robbing people of their identity and quality of life. Through the dedication of Robert Lipsky, PhD, a new genetic test is being developed using his discovery of a revolutionary genetic marker for Alzheimer's called GRIN2B. It has been shown to be associated with Alzheimer's development in people of European descent. Using this marker, Dr. Lipsky is now testing different interventions that may prevent this devastating disease. It is well recognized that not all treatments need to be medications or surgery; lifestyle changes can support brain health. Improved brain health means better brain performance for healthy individuals. Therefore, this work will be linked to INSI's Brain Health Program. Genetics Affects Recovery from Spinal Cord Injury Spinal cord injury (SCI) exacts a tremendous financial, physical and psychological toll on those affected. The neurological deficit resulting from acute SCI is not simply a consequence of the initial tissue impact, but rather a combination of the resultant injury and the secondary inflammatory response, which in turn leads to further neural destruction. Certain genes have the potential to modify this inflammatory response. One of these genes, called CHRFAM7A, was studied by INSI researchers and colleagues from George Mason University, the University of Kentucky and the University of Pittsburgh. We 50 | Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 Research (continued) discovered that certain variants of the CHRFAM7A gene are associated with reduced levels of inflammatory biomarkers in blood and better clinical outcomes, including a reduction in nerve pain developed by SCI patients. The study was published in 2019. (Wan Huang, Nadine Kabbani, Tricia K. Brannan, Ming Kuan Lin, Mark M. Theiss, John F. Hamilton, M. Ecklund, Yvette P. Conley, Yoram Vodovotz, David Brienza, Amy K. Robbins, Gwendolyn A. Sowa and Robert H.

Since about half of all SCI patients develop nerve pain following their injury, this information could be used to more effectively treat SCI patients who have nerve pain. Research Aimed to Help Solve Public Health Crisis Opioid Crisis and Biomarkers Research Project The opioid crisis is a growing epidemic in the United States. Currently, a project to develop different treatment options via biomarkers and advanced data analytics is in research. We are working with a pharmaceutical industry partner to discover the genetic basis of how individuals with opioid addiction respond to therapy. We expect that a series of genes are affected that will predict how well patients respond to their medication. In this way, treatment will be paired with individuals based on their genetics.

During their fourth year of medical school, medical students are permitted to participate in a four-week clerkship rotation in either neurology or neurological surgery. The clerkships are conducted by neuroscience faculty and are an opportunity for the students to explore the possibility of selecting neurology or neurological surgery specialty. It is also an opportunity to further hone their skills in the evaluation and treatment of neurological disorders. A four-week neurological surgery rotation is also available to fourth-year medical students from other medical schools as an away rotation. INSI hosted one fourth-year visiting medical student for a four-week neurosurgery rotation in 2019. International Fellowship The INSI international fellowship, started in 2011, has trained three international clinicians. This is one of the many ways INSI has contributed to the education of neuroscience physicians. Now in its ninth year, the INSI neurosurgical international fellowship program is for practicing neurosurgeons outside the U.S. who are interested in further developing their skills in leading- edge neurological procedures, practice and research. Upon completion of the program, they are expected to return and develop new programs in their home countries. Past participants were drawn from countries such as Greece and Lebanon, and participated for a period of one to two years. The international fellowship provides an individual with a comprehensive, supervised, full-time educational experience in caring for neurosurgical patients, including the comprehensive management of patients with neurological illnesses, the performance of surgical procedures and the clinical management of patients. CME Symposia INSI began offering national conferences in 2011, with the Dr. Kenneth M. Earle Memorial Neuropathology Review and Washington Neuroradiology Review course, formerly known as the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) Neuroradiology and Neuropathology Review Course. In 2019, INSI offered five annual conferences that will continue to be held on an annual basis, including the Dr. Kenneth M. Earle Memorial conference. These conferences are multidisciplinary symposia, attracting speakers from throughout the country to provide the 54 | Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 education necessary for medical and clinical participants to enhance their skills in an engaging, thought-provoking environment.

INSI Advanced Education - Corporate INSI has developed customized educational programs targeted to meet a specific need or audience. Examples of programs include medical education tailored for athletic trainers, physical therapists, U.S. law enforcement and U.S. emergency management personnel. INSI Advanced Education - Academia The emergent field of neurotechnologies and \"wiring up\" human brains is leading us into a new future. Examples include big data- enhanced diagnostics and treatments, brain-computer interfaces for brain control, real-time neuromonitoring, and brain-responsive computer systems. Current research now seeks to optimize the long-term stability and biocompatibility of such brain implants to make them viable for practical use. INSI faculty have collaborated with George Mason University to offer undergraduate and graduate-level engineering courses that give students applied experience in clinical technologies related to neurotechnologies and biomedical commercialization. The goal of these courses is to help students further their study, innovation and applied thinking. Courses developed include: Introduction to Biomedical Commercialization - a course designed to introduce students to the process of commercialization, with discussions on design, validation, patents, business strategy and fundraising. Introduction to Neurotechnologies - a course designed to provide senior students with applied clinical technologies experience, including VP shunts, radiology, spinal instrumentation, stereotaxy, Neuropace and EEG technologies.Education and CME (continued) Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 | 61 In 2019, INSI launched a new Brain Health Program, as well as expanded access and services for both Inova Neurology and Inova Neurosurgery with the opening of an office location in Gainesville, Virginia. INSI continues to expand neurology and neurosurgical services across the five Inova hospitals in the health system and to use telemedicine to help patients in remote areas of Northern Virginia have improved access to care. Brain Health Program Brain health involves an individual's cognitive, neuropsychological and mental state. Brain health determines our ability to perform well in the classroom, at work and at home. INSI's Brain Health Program, which opened in 2019, is Northern Virginia's first program focused on improving and maintaining brain wellness and cognitive performance for all ages, in both healthy and at-risk populations. We provide a comprehensive program that assesses and coaches individuals. Clients undergo a baseline screening. Scientific research has demonstrated that people can make simple lifestyle changes that support brain health. Improved brain health means better brain performance for healthy individuals, as well as individuals with neurological condition or injury (e.g., stroke or TBI). The Brain Health Program has a strategic partnership with the Center for BrainHealth\u00ae at The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD).* In conjunction with UTD, the Inova Brain Health Program will conduct research to further understanding and knowledge related to optimization of brain health and performance. We note that UTD is a leading research university that has pioneered much of the brain health scientific understanding and intervention programs currently available. We Offer Services will include cognitive training and coaching on diet, sleep, social networking and other relevant interventions, as well as guidance on how to incorporate these into normal life routines. Follow-up assessments will gauge progress and facilitate continued coaching. \"Our individual performance is significantly impacted by our brain function. The Inova Brain Health Program will offer innovative services supported by scientific evidence to help achieve optimal brain health and performance. We are very excited to launch the first Brain Health Program of this kind in our region.\" Mary Fountain, MPH Director Brain Health Program Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute What's Ahead 62 | Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute 2019 Contact Us l Refer a Patient For more information about donations to help build the future of INSI, please contact Janet Flip, Executive Director of Development, Inova Neuroscience and Spine Institute, at janet.flip@inova.org or 703.776.3328. Telemedicine Overview Since 2004, when Inova's Telemedicine Program became one of the first tele-ICUs in the country, we have improved patient health by applying communications technology to patient care delivery, research and education. By using modern technology, we are able to extend clinical expertise to patients at any geographic location in our area. Today, the Telemedicine Program supports 18 service lines at nearly 50 locations throughout Virginia. Awards The program was the first in the country to be awarded the American Association of Critical Care Nurses' prestigious Gold Beacon Award. It also manages the virtual technology for the Northern Virginia Hospital Alliance emergency preparedness program. INSI Use of Telemedicine Telemedicine extends INSI's access to patients who have difficulty coming to a main center for a neurological or neurosurgery clinical specialist consult or stroke center triage, where time is of the essence. INSI will continue to use telemedicine to reach those in remote locations and connect them with our neurologists and neurosurgeons. Remote Stroke Triage Our emergency rooms are equipped with specially designed mobile carts that enable our neurologists to remotely assess potential stroke patients. Leveraging synchronous, secure videoconferencing software, clinicians have access to the patient's bedside location for remote evaluation when urgent decisions are needed.What's Ahead (continued) \"Telemedicine is the remote delivery of healthcare services using telecommunications technology as defined by the American Telemedicine Association. For INSI, our telemedicine services follow the same clinical principles for delivery of patient care, safety and desired outcome as in-person consultations. The difference is that our neurologists and neurosurgeons utilize virtual health tools to deliver care in remote areas for patients who are unable to make it to our care centers. At its core, telemedicine is helps increase access to quality care.\" Steven Dean, MS Administrator Director of Telemedicine Operations Inova Health System Funding the Future We thank all INSI donors who have joined with our clinicians and staff to help us get to where we are today: a leader in the diagnosis, treatment and research of complex neurological conditions involving the brain, spine and peripheral nervous system. We now have every specialty represented as well as coordinated work in research and education. We remain true to the quest of improving the lives of neuroscience patients by inspiring hope and delivering seamless, integrated care of the highest quality across all of INSI's specialties, while simultaneously enhancing education and research. We still feel a sense of urgency to continue to accelerate our capabilities, and there are many ways that philanthropic support can further our work.
