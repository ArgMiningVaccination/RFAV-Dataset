It acts as the army of the body defending it from illnesses and diseases. The immune system is not only made up of the white blood cells that we know produce antibodies; it also includes proteins, tissues, and some body organs. Antibodies are the ones that protect and fight off any harmful organisms that try to enter the body. Some people might argue that they can take medication to help their bodies fight infections. However, there isn't proper medication to fight some diseases like viral infections. In this case, the body must fend off the virus on its own using its immunity system. Therefore, an individual must take care of his or her immune system to remain healthy and strong to be able to carry out its role. However, at times, the health of the immune system is beyond the control of an individual. This is the case if the individual has certain conditions that cause the immune system to malfunction. Some of these conditions include cancer, allergy disorders as well as autoimmune disorders. How Can People Boost Their Immune System? There are various ways we can improve our immune system: \u00b7 Eating foods high in vitamin C. Vitamin C is present mostly in citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, and limes. \u00b7 Working out regularly. Exercising the body regularly ensures that the body remains in good shape. This means that its systems, which include the immune system, can function well. \u00b7 Getting chiropractic care. Many people think that chiropractic treatment is only for people who suffer from neck and back pain. Chiropractic treatment has been used for the treatment of pain and discomfort, but people are beginning to see its benefits on the immune system. The spine has a direct connection to the immune system. When the spine is not lined up correctly, it affects many systems which include the immune system. Chiropractic therapy improves the immune system through the spine. It focuses on the spinal area and works to align it correctly. Chiropractors know how to manipulate the spine and relieve it from the pressure that would otherwise compress the pathway of nerves. Chiropractic treatment also boosts immunity by improving the way the spine sends signals to other parts of the body. The spine has a connection to the central nervous system and chiropractic treatment keeps it in proper alignment. This means messages and signals can travel well and freely to other parts of the body. Numerous studies have been done on the effect of chiropractic care on the immune system. People who have received chiropractic care have shown a higher chance of beating various illnesses. For this reason, experts believe that chiropractic therapy is beneficial to anyone looking to improve the state of their immunity and general body health.
