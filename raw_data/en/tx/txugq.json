Acupuncture and Chinese medicine [Read More](1-description) What is acupuncture and Chinese medicine? Chinese medicine is a whole-person healing modality that has been in continuous practice for over 2000 years. Although it is commonly referred to in the US as 'acupuncture', acupuncture is merely one of the most widely-used of many treatments based on the Chinese medical theoretical system. These other treatments include Chinese herbal therapy, Shiatsu or Tui Na bodywork, acupuressure, moxibustion, cupping, Gua Sha, dietary and lifestyle advice, and various forms of movement therapy like Qi Gong or Tai Chi. This tradition regards human beings as complex energetic systems, from which spring both the physical body and the mind and spirit-- so diseases and disorders of any one of these might affect any of the others, and treatment of any of these might influence symptoms of any of the others. Chinese medicine addresses physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual diseases and disorders by encouraging the patient's energetic systems to balance the production and flow of qi (roughly, the energy or life-force), blood, and essence, and strengthening the systems to withstand the influence of external pernicious influences. What is acupuncture and Chinese medicine good for? The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes that acupuncture has been conclusively proven to help the following. It is not considered a comprehensive list, but is a good indicator of the breadth of applicability of this medicine. Adverse reactions to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy Allergic rhinitis (including hay fever) [allergies] Biliary colic [gallstones] Renal colic [kidney stones] Depression (including depressive neurosis, depression following stroke) Dysentery, acute bacillary [bacterial intestinal infection gastrospasm) [spastic stomach pain] Facial pain (including craniomandibular disorders) Headache Knee pain Neck pain Low back pain Post-operative pain Sprain Tennis elbow Hypertension, essential [high blood fetus [turning breech babies] Morning sickness [in pregnancy] Nausea, vomiting Pain in dentistry (incl. dental of shoulder [tendon or initially affecting joints] Sciatica [nerve pain from low back to leg] Stroke What can I expect from a treatment? What do I need to do to prepare for it? During an initial acupuncture treatment, the licensed acupuncturist will ask you about your chief complaint, as well as your health history and general health. The acupuncture is performed on a massage table, and you will usually remain fully-dressed; make sure your clothing will allow access to your legs to above the knee and your arms to your elbows. Most patients feel very little needle sensation, though other sensations are often experienced-- most of which patients experience as pleasant and interesting. You will typically be left to rest with the needles in for 15-25 minutes. Other modalities, including bodywork, moxibustion, cupping, etc., may be used as well, and you can also be evaluated for herbal treatment during the same session. You should leave feeling relaxed and energized, although some patients report some fatigue after their first session. Group acupuncture is performed in a larger space with several other patients present. The interview and treatment are abbreviated, but the treatments are still very effective. Points on the head, arms and legs below the elbows and knees, and hands and feet are employed, so clothes can remain on and in-place. Shiatsu treatments begin with a brief interview about goals and symptoms, followed by a diagnosis made with abdominal palpation. The bodywork is performed on a massage table or on a cushioned mat on the floor. Patients should wear stretchy, soft, comfortable clothing, like sweats or yoga clothes, which fully cover them, including clean socks. None of these treatments are expected to fully resolve your problem during one session, though we aim to have you feel better each time. Your prognosis and treatment plan will vary by what issue you're trying to address, how severe it is, how long you've had it, and your age and general health.

Your comfort is your therapist's main priority - please feel free to voice any concerns or preferences you may have before or during your massage. Depending on the type of treatment plan you create with your massage therapist, you may leave your appointment feeling energized, or relaxed and sleepy.

Reiki is a gentle relaxation technique that has been reported to promote physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It involves the transfer of universal life energy (prana, chi) through the palms/hands of a trained and certified practitioner, who serves as a channel. The reiki practitioner usually begins by assessing your energy centers and auric fields, and then focuses on clearing and rebalancing energy pathways that flow through and from each chakra, a Sanskrit word that refers to the main energy centers or energy wheels of the body. Reiki is usually completed on a massage table while the client is fully clothed. Light, non-invasive touch or no touch at all may be involved, based on the client's preferences. Reiki is not intended for use in diagnosing, treating, or preventing dis-ease. What can reiki help with? - reducing stress - improving sleep and focus - improving digestion - supporting recovery from injury or surgery - anxiety - depression - fertility - acute and chronic pain What can I expect from a reiki session? What do I need to do to prepare for it? Before the session, reserve space in your schedule for yourself so that you are not rushing to another commitment right away. Wear loose, comfortable clothes to the session. Avoid caffeine, smoking, alcohol, large meals before the session. Take time to share with the practitioner about any injuries, scars, sensitivities, and specific needs. The practitioner will walk you through a brief client history and consent form during your first visit. During the session, the practitioner will move her hands around you using light, non-invasive touch and/or hovering above the physical body. You may experience sensations in your body such as heat or tingling, visualize colors or images, or notice old memories appear/resurface. Emotional release may also come up through crying/tearfulness or laughing. Some people fall asleep or enter a sleep-like state and experience deep relaxation. You are encouraged to keep an open mind and open heart, as people's first time experiencing reiki can range from subtle/uneventful to intense. Don't put expectations on yourself or force yourself to relax; allow the reiki to relax you. After the session, you may feel refreshed and energized, becoming more grounded and focused; however, you may also feel more tired in the evening than usual, an indication of the body's natural healing response. Pay attention to what your body needs and prioritize rest and sleep as much as possible. If certain thoughts or memories repeat themselves, consider journaling or meditating on them without judgment. In order for buried emotional/mental/spiritual wounds to heal, they must first come to the surface and this often feels unfamiliar and uncomfortable for most people. For further insight or guidance, always feel free to contact the reiki practitioner with any questions or comments as you move through your process.

More](15-description) What is Integrative a powerful yet gentle healing modality that combines traditional Chinese medical theory with modern medical knowledge to provide a comprehensive container for healing. The foundation of acupressure is similar to that of acupuncture and shiatsu \u2014 the energetic meridian networks. Congestion and imbalance within a meridian causes dis-ease and stress to accumulate in the associated bodily systems. Acupressure uses finger pressure to \"run\" or massage along the meridian network, promoting the rebalancing of healthy flowing qi, life force energy. Integrative acupressure combines this energetic approach with a method of non-forceful musculoskeletal release. This method incorporates neurological repatterning techniques to help retain those new patterns long after the session. Coupled with this are several powerful modalities including cranial release, lymphatic release and abdominal organ release to optimize the free-flow of life force. What is Integrative Acupressure good for? Integrative Acupressure is beneficial for both acute and chronic health ailments. It can be particularly useful in treating: heightened nervous system stress, digestive issues, taxed kidneys and adrenal, post-chemotherapy and radiation symptoms, headache, neck pain and stiffness, nausea, anxiety, trauma, joint mis-alignment, TMJ, stagnant and swollen lymph, organ adhesions, sinus issues, autoimmune system disorders, arthritis, sleep troubles. The objective of the treatment is to bring the body into deeper relaxation, structural and energetic alignment, closer to its natural homeostatic state. What can I expect from a treatment or series of treatments? What do I need to do to prepare for it? Acupressure is available for people of all abilities, body-types, and many different types of ailments. Acute issues can often be addressed in just 1 or 2 sessions. The more chronic and long-term an issue is, the longer it may take to address fully. Acupressure is an extremely powerful tool for mitigating the effects of long-term stress in the body. Sessions are performed fully-clothed on a massage table. Most types of clothing are good, thinner and looser clothing is best. Before your first session begins we will discuss your symptoms and goals for treatment. As appropriate, you will be on your belly for part of the session and on your back for part. Acupressure sessions can be profoundly healing and deeply emotional. During the session your job is just to relax deeply. I will assist you, as needed, to recognize what is arising physically and emotionally, and to stay present with your body's experience.

Broadly speaking, holistic psychotherapy is therapy that treats the whole person instead of a disorder. Rather than trying to control, manage or reduce the symptoms of a disorder, holistic psychotherapy emphasizes root causes to help tell the full story of someone's suffering. While symptoms often reduce on their own, the aims of a holistic approach typically include cultivating a greater capacity to accept & love oneself, heal underlying wounds and cultivate new psychological resources that promote wellness, quality of life and human flourishing. Holistic psychotherapy includes and integrates many different forms of psychotherapy (e.g. Internal family systems, mindfulness, psychodynamic), many of which have strong scientific support and in some cases may offer more robust and sustaining outcomes than conventional approaches. What is holistic psychotherapy good for? Holistic psychotherapy can be an excellent adjunct or alternative to mainstream approaches (e.g., Cognitive Behavior Therapy). People often seek holistic therapies because traditional approaches have not adequately met their needs, they are looking to deepen or expand their recovery by addressing root causes, or they seek a therapy that better aligns with their values or preferences. What can I expect from service? What do I need to do to prepare? Everyone enters psychotherapy differently and there is no one size fits all approach to initiating the client therapist relationship. Both client and therapist should collaboratively move through the initial phase of therapy at a pace that feels comfortable to the client. By the end of the beginning phase of treatment (e.g., 2-8 sessions), you should anticipate having completed the follow with your therapist; establishing rapport, discussing relevant history, collaboratively establishing a goal/vision for your treatment, and reviewing boundaries of the treatment relationship. If you feel like you've found the right therapist and wish to continue, therapy is an ongoing process of learning to open up about one's authentic thoughts and feelings in an effort gain greater awareness and acceptance of one's psychological difficulties. In most cases, people benefit from participating in psychotherapy and see a variety of improvements in both their social and emotional functioning. You don't need to do anything specific to prepare for the appointment.
