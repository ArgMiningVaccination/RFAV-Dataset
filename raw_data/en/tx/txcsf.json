These are wounds that go through the skin to the fat tissue. Caused by a sharp object. - Scrapes, abrasions, scratches and floor burns. These are surface wounds that don't go all the way through the skin. Scrapes are common on the knees, elbows and palms. - Bruises. These are bleeding into the skin from damaged blood vessels. Caused by a blunt object. They can occur without a cut or scrape. When Sutures (Stitches) are Needed for Cuts - Any cut that is split open or gaping needs sutures. - Cuts longer than \u00bd inch (12 mm) usually need sutures. - On the face, cuts longer than \u00bc inch (6 mm) usually need to be seen. They usually need closure with sutures or skin glue. - Any open wound that may need sutures should be seen as soon as possible. Ideally, they should be checked and closed within 6 hours. Reason: to prevent wound infections. There is no cutoff, however, for treating open wounds. Cuts Versus Scratches: Helping You Decide - The skin is about 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick. - A cut (laceration) goes through it. - A scratch or scrape (wide scratch) doesn't go through the skin. - Cuts that gape open at rest or with movement need stitches to prevent scarring. - Scrapes and scratches never need stitches, no matter how long they are. - So this distinction is important.

Care Advice for Minor Cuts, Scrapes or Bruises - Cuts, Scratches and Scrapes - Treatment: - Use direct pressure to stop any bleeding. Do this for 10 minutes or until the bleeding stops. - Wash the wound with soap and water for 5 minutes. Try to rinse the cut under running water. - Caution: Never soak a wound that might need sutures. Reason: It may become more swollen and harder to close. - Gently scrub out any dirt with a washcloth. - Use an antibiotic ointment (such as Polysporin). No prescription is needed. Then, cover it with a bandage (such as Band-Aid). Change daily. - Liquid Skin Bandage for Minor Cuts: - Liquid skin bandage seals wounds with a plastic coating. It lasts up to 1 week. - Liquid skin bandage has several benefits compared to other bandages (such as Band-Aid). Liquid bandage only needs to be put on once. It seals the wound and may promote faster healing and lower infection rates. Also, it's water-proof. - Use for any small break in the skin. Examples are paper cuts, hangnails and cracks on the fingers or toes. - Wash and dry the wound first. Then, put on the liquid. It comes with a brush or swab. It dries in less than a minute. - You can get this product at a drugstore near you. There are many brands of liquid bandage. No prescription is needed. - Bruises - Treatment: - Use a cold pack or ice bag wrapped in a wet cloth. Put it on the bruise once for 20 minutes. This will help to stop the bleeding. - After 48 hours, use a warm wet wash cloth. Do this for 10 minutes 3 times per day. This helps to reabsorb the blood. - Pain Medicine: - To help with the pain, give an acetaminophen product (such as Tylenol). - Another choice is an ibuprofen product (such as Advil). - Use as needed. - Tetanus Shot: - A tetanus shot update may be needed for cuts and other open wounds. - Check your vaccine records to see when your child got the last one. - For Dirty Cuts and Scrapes. If last tetanus shot was given over 5 years ago, need a booster. - For Clean Cuts. If last tetanus shot was given over 10 years ago, need a booster. - See your child's doctor for a booster during regular office hours. It's safe to give it within 3 days or less. - What to Expect: - Small cuts and scrapes heal up in less than a week. - Call Your Doctor If: - Bleeding does not stop after using direct pressure to the cut - Starts to look infected (pus, redness) - Doesn't heal by 10 days - You think your child needs to be seen - Your child becomes worse And remember, contact your doctor if your child develops any of the 'Call Your Doctor' symptoms.
