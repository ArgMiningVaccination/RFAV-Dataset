At the ACMSF meeting in Dece mber the Committee discussed amending the advice on the cooking and eating of eggs. During their discussion of the issues the Committee asked for further information on the contamination rates in non-UK eggs as well as information on the level of non-UK eggs on retail sale in the UK. It was felt that this information would be important for the review of the FSA egg advice by demonstrating whether non-UK eggs are a significant source of Salmonella infection or not. FSA survey of non-UK eggs 2. Since the December meeting the FSA has commissioned a 14-month long survey of non-UK eggs on retail sale in the UK. This work is being carried out by the Health Protection A gency and began in March 2005. Sampling is being carried out in the north We st of England and the areas in and around London by local authorities sa mpling officers (EHOs). The sampling is co-ordinated by the relevant Food Liaison Groups (FLGs). 3. The final report for the retail surv ey of non-UK eggs is to be published in late summer 2006. This is the firs t of three proposed non-UK egg surveys to be carried out by the Agency aiming to measure the level of prevalence in eggs coming into the UK and the eggs used in the catering industry. 4. The Agency has just received its first se t of results from t he survey. In the first month of sampling 23 samples of 6 eggs have been taken. All were tested negative for Salmonella . This initial dataset should be seen as 'bedding in' results whilst the various protocols were tested. The survey of catering eggs, which will sample both UK and non-UK eggs, is beingdeveloped and the protocol has been sent to the ACMSF sub-group on surveillance for comment. The third su rvey is of wholesale eggs and will mean the whole chain should have been covered. Previous non-UK egg surveys 5. Data on Salmonella contamination of shell egg s in catering premises is limited. In 1991, a Depar tment of Health funded survey of imported eggs at the port of entry was carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service 1. The Salmonella prevalence was 1.6% fr om 8,630 samples of six eggs. In 1996/97, DH carried out a further survey, comprising 1,433 samples of 6 non-UK shell eggs taken from importers1. The study found the prevalence of Salmonella in non-UK eggs to be 1 in 49 boxes of 6 eggs, a per box prevalence of 2.0%. The results from these surveys suggested that there had been little improvement in Salmonellacontamination of non-UK eggs coming into the country. In 2003, the HPA/LACORS network carried out a survey of eggs (including duck and other species) used in catering premises. The survey collected both UK (88%) and non-UK eggs (12%)2. The overall prevalence of Salmonella in catering eggs was 0.3% of samples of 6 eggs. Because of the relatively small number of non-UK egg samples tested, it is not possible to provide a statistically valid comparis on between UK and non-UK eggs. 6. Despite the dataset generated by these surveys, there is still a gap in information relating to the current prevalence of Salmonella in non-UK eggs consumed in the UK, particularly in relation to the variation in the patterns of trade. The current and forthcoming FSA surveys will aim to capture data on the prevalence of Salmonella in non-UK eggs used within the catering sector and sold at hi gh street retailers, wholesalers and importers. The results of these su rveys and the previous survey of UK eggs on retail sale will be used to a ssess whether the advice on the use and consumption of eggs should be changed. Current position on Spanish eggs 7. The National Outbreak Control Team (OCT) dossier was presented to the Commission in December. The point was reiterated to the Commission that the UK's dossier is firmly based on scientific investigations and, although each line of evidence on its own may be considered insufficient tomake a case, it is the accumulated weight of evidence that convinced our experts that there was a strong asso ciation between Spanish eggs and the increase in cases of non-PT4 Salmonella Enteritidis. To date, there have been no outbreaks associated with Span ish eggs in 2005. The Agency has now received a report on implem entation of the Spanish plan for controlling Salmonella in eggs, which is in the process of being translated. Conclusions- amendments to advice 8. The survey of non-UK eggs at retail sa le is currently in the first few months of sampling. At pres ent there is an insuffici ent number of samples to ascertain incidence of contamination or to make statistical comparisons regarding the prevalence of Salmonella in non-UK eggs. However initial information on the number of non-UK eggs found on retail sale indicates that they have an important share of the retail market and that it would be premature to review the ACMSF advice to the Agency before these surveys are completed.
