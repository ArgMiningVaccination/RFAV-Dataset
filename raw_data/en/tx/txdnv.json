By early July 2021, it was estimated that US$12.445 billion had already been awarded for vaccine development, a large part from public resources [2] . International Covid-19 funding was overwhelmingly dedicated to vaccines, at the expense of other strategies. Take the example of the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a 'global collaboration of the world's top international health organisations working together to accelerate the development, production, and equitable delivery of Covid-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines'. The overall aim of ACT-A is 'to speed up an end to the pandemic by supporting the development and equitable distribution of the tests, treatments and vaccines the world needs'. As of 9 July 2021, public and private donors had already pledged over US$12.2 billion to COVAX (the vaccines pillar of the (ACT) Accelerator) [3] . By contrast, very little has been invested in the search for treatment, or for health system strengthening, or system readiness, especially in terms of enhancing primary care, human resources, and training. Table 1 shows the estimated needs (targets) and pledges to the ACT Accelerator along its four pillars as of 9 July 2021. The vaccine pillar received 84% of confirmed financing, leaving the pillar with a gap of 7% of estimated needs. This contrasts with the three other pillars, which face a funding gap of 82% (therapeutics), 89% (diagnostics) and 91% (health system) of needs, respectively. What this suggests is that the Covid-19 response policy remains fixated on vaccines, where all other bets are off. Source : Authors, based on ACT-Accelerator Commitment Tracker [3] Here, we do not question the principle of immunisation, particularly immunisation that prevents disease transmission and infection, which has led to undisputable successes in many areas and is, overall, 'one of the best health investments money can buy' [4] . Moreover, it would be churlish to dismiss the unprecedented feat and pace of development of anti-Covid-19 vaccines. The vaccines approved to date have proven to be safe and very effective -at least in the short run [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . This gives the world hope that the pandemic can ultimately be controlled. Yet, at this point, we do not readily accept the majority narrative that we've hit the jackpot through vaccines. Here, we argue that the current strategy of staking everything on vaccines, without sufficient hindsight on its risk-benefit ratio, and at the expense of complementary strategies (treatment, health system strengthening, non-pharmaceutical prevention, promotion of safe conditions that prevent transmission, and healthy lifestyles), was -and may still remain -insufficient, reactive, short-sighted, and an unnecessary high-stakes wager that is tempting fortune. Below, we highlight a number of limitations of the \"vaccine-focused\" strategy, and discuss the lack of complementary strategies. We conclude by proposing avenues for designing a more balanced and risk-adverse Covid-19 response policy. Remaining uncertainties about the vaccine gamble First, many unknowns remain as for the medium-term performance, including sustainability, of the Covid-19 vaccine strategy. The efficacy of candidate vaccines has been determined through randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs), coined the gold standard in clinical designs for their high internal validity. Yet, context is essential when interpreting the results of any randomised trial [11] because no intervention acts on two persons in an identical fashion, and results are influenced by individual risk factors [12] . Moreover, the criteria used by clinical trials to evaluate Covid-19 vaccine efficacy were not fully relevant for managing the pandemic [13, 14] . Considering the extremely diverse patterns of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, it is feasible that RCTs are limited in their capacity to comprehend the complexity of the interaction between each patient, their immune system, and the vaccine. As a result, policy that bets heavily on post-facto pandemic vaccine discovery, RCTs, and expedited approval processes, risk to be too standardised to accommodate for various subgroups' specificities, like pregnant women or ethnic minorities [15, 16] , and therefore risks being suboptimal. As one example, problems have emerged for people with serious allergies, who were vaccinated with severe side-effects, but who were later discovered to be excluded from the Pfizer clinical trials, leaving clinicians in the UK unprepared [17] .
