Feeling like sleep just isn't enough? These can be signs it's time to find some support for your immunity. There are several ways to strengthen your immune system naturally through simple lifestyle changes. The best way to strengthen your immune system is to eat a well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet. Be sure to consume plenty of foods with vitamin C like broccoli, oranges or cantaloupe. Antioxidant-rich, colorful fruits and vegetables, such as berries, carrots and spinach, help support immunity by protecting your body from harmful compounds called free radicals. Try to avoid processed foods and excess sugars. Stay hydrated with plenty of water and other sugar- and caffeine-free beverages. If a balanced diet doesn't fit into your lifestyle just yet, you can enhance it with over the counter [vitamins, minerals and supplements](https://www.riteaid.com/shop/vitamins-supplements).

A combination of strength and cardio training keeps your body resilient and better able to fight off infections. It may reduce the chance of getting a respiratory infection by flushing the bacteria out of your lungs and airways. Exercise also causes your body to release endorphins, hormones produced by the brain naturally produced which may boost happiness and mitigate stress and anxiety levels. Our bodies produce the hormone cortisol in response to stress. Consistently high levels of cortisol can wreak havoc on the immune system. As a reaction, blood pressure increases and resistance to fighting infection decreases. Meditation is a great technique to reduce stress and anxiety. It is calming, lowers heart rate and decreases blood pressure. Try sitting quietly and focusing on your breathing as you inhale and exhale, just even for five minutes per day can be helpful. Adults need at least seven to eight hours of quality sleep each night. It is our body's time to regenerate new cells and acquire the energy needed to fight off infection. Sleep deprivation can decrease immune function. If you have some trouble [falling asleep](https://www.riteaid.com/shop/medicine-health/sleep-snoring-aids) or staying asleep, try an essential oil diffuser.
