(Stories from the Spectrum: Neurodiversity, Health, and Medicine in Literature.) A boy with a penchant for prime numbers investigates the death of a dog. A young girl is scolded for failing to look her teacher in the eye. A man in the throes of a midlife crisis returns to his nonverbal son as he spiritually finds himself. Hidden within these narratives of neurodiverse characters, one discovers a slew of cultural assumptions about cognitive and intellectual disabilities. Do neurotypical writers often turn to autism reductively, as a stand-in for a theme or metaphor? What might an authentic representation of Autism Spectrum look like? This course considers the value of neurodiversity in literature while exploring many of the troubling representations of cognitive difference across time, from earlier accounts of un-speaking children to the \"\"rain mans\"\" of contemporary film. This course ultimately takes seriously the bi-directional intersections between fiction and medicine, as real-life medical practices both shape and are shaped by these stories from the spectrum. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ENGL 232 NEUR 249: Brains, Minds, and Madness in Liter (Brains, Minds, and Madness in Literature.) Stories invite us into the minds of others. As readers, we step into another's consciousness: into fictional memories, sensations, and narratives that feel real, as the words of often-dead writers become part of our own brain-matter. Yet, how do our theories of the mind and its operations relate to literary representations of a character's interiority? And what can contemporary neuroscience teach us about literature, or about our own minds on literature? In this course, we examine stories and theories of the mind across time, exploring scientific writing about the brain alongside literary masterpieces from Jane Austen to Ian McEwan. Moreover, we consider the close connection between sanity and insanity, examining the representations of madness and other neurological ailments in brains gone \"\"wrong.\"\" No Prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ENGL 249 NEUR 254: The Mind Onstage (The Mind Onstage: Performance, Action, Emotion.) In the last decade, prominent theater scholars have integrated neuroscience research into their studies. Their excitement stems from the realization that current scientific research seems to speak directly to one of the major concerns of theatre scholars for decades: How does performing and/or watching a performance affect the brain? In this interdisciplinary class, students study plays that depict neuroscience and neurological conditions, learn about how theatre is used therapeutically, and read contemporary and classic theatrical theory, as we explore the ways science and the humanities can intersect. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements.) cross listed: THTR 254 NEUR 268: Music and the Mind In this course, we wrestle with fundamental questions regarding music and the human experience. Why does music exist? How did it evolve in the human species? What, exactly, does it do to us, as listeners and as practitioners? How does music change our brains? Is there really such a thing as a \"\"Mozart Effect?\"\" What new promises are there for therapeutic uses for music? Music's presence in the human species is clearly puzzling. While many scholars have speculated a reason for its existence, there is no definitive answer as to why we make music. Nevertheless, we do make music. There is not a single human culture on Earth that has no music. Some of the books we will be reading include Musicophilia, The Singing Neanderthals, and This is Your Brain on Music. Note that this is a course that requires students to give oral presentations. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: PHIL 291 NEUR 296: Philosophy of Mind With the rise of Cognitive Science, Computer Science, and Neuroscience, questions about the nature of mind have become increasingly important, and in the last 40 years much work on philosophy of mind has been done in analytic philosophy. The class will begin with an examination of some of the most influential texts in philosophy of mind from the last 50 years, and then proceed to current topics. Central questions may include: What is the relationship between the mind and the brain? Is it possible to offer explanations of mental states by reducing them to biological, chemical, or physical states? Can human consciousness be best explained in terms of a computer model? Is it possible to describe the functioning of human thought in terms of a rule-based system of processing? (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.

Much of the course is devoted to learning about a wide range of diagnoses, including their associated clinical characteristics, proposed etiologies (causes), and treatments. We consider a variety of perspectives, paradigms, and methods, including the connections between biological, psychological, and social foundations of psychopathology. We reflect critically on the current state of our knowledge, including, crucially, what we don't yet know with confidence. We raise challenging questions: how do we even define \"psychological disorder\" in the first place? Are psychological disorders \"just\" brain disorders? What are the consequences (positive or negative) of being diagnosed with a psychological disorder? We also challenge common myths and stereotypes that pervade our social discourse and contribute to stigma. Throughout the course, we keep in mind that how we define and treat psychological disorders is a reflection of our evolving cultural and scientific paradigms\u2014and has profound consequences for real people. Prerequisite: Psychology 221 with a grade of at least C-. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: PSYC 350 NEUR 351: Personal Genetics The human genome comprises roughly 21,000 genes, each with its own variants and intricacies of function. A student chooses one gene in which they are personally interested (perhaps the gene causing celiac disease or breast cancer), researches and discusses the function of the gene with their peers, designs a way to clone the gene from their own cells (or from an anonymous donor), and obtains the DNA sequence of part of their gene. The project culminates in a grant proposal. The decision on which gene is studied is entirely student-driven. Other topics include the use of model organisms or cell cultures in the study of human disease, advanced mechanisms of gene editing like CRISPR-Cas9, or state of the art cancer treatments like CAR T-cell therapy. This course is a combination of four hours seminar and laboratory, and senior capstone experience will be earned with one 300-level course as prerequisite and advanced work.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) cross listed: BIOL 362, BMB 362 NEUR 365: The Neuroscience of Sleep Why do we sleep? Despite the fact that we spend a third of our lives sleeping, neuroscience research has only just begun to answer this fundamental question. In this course, we delve into the fascinating field of brain-based research by investigating several sleep-related topics (e.g., sleep across species, the role of sleep in cognitive functions, sleep disorders, and dreaming). We explore these topics through the lens of contemporary neuroscientific work, so the majority of class time is dedicated to student-led presentations and discussions of primary research articles. Outside of class, students conduct independent research on a niche sleep-related topic, ultimately developing a thorough literature review and an original grant proposal. Prerequisites: BIOL 221 and PSYC 110 or permission of the instructor.

(Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) cross listed: BIOL 372, PSYC 372, is an emerging interdisciplinary field that incorporates the findings of neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and philosophy to tackle key ethical issues in science, philosophy, health, and medicine. In this discipline, we explore two primary areas of study. The first is the neuroscience of ethics, which asks what current research in neuroscience and related fields can tell us about ethics. The second is the ethics of neuroscience, which asks how the study of ethics can inform emerging technologies and findings from the rapidly developing field of neuroscience. This course introduces students to both areas of research. As such, the course investigates a variety of questions related to free will, moral reasoning, memory, neuroenhancement, neuromarketing, cognitive enhancement, and how the law deals with these issues. Prerequisite: at least one 100- level course in philosophy, neuroscience, or psychology, or permission from the instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: PHIL 375 NEUR 385: Comparative Psychology In this course, students explore the key themes and classic studies of comparative psychology - the psychological investigation of the similarities and differences of animal species. Psychology and neuroscience research depends on studies using nonhuman species to examine both experimental and clinical topics. This course covers the types of comparisons made in the discipline, the overarching questions that provide structure to the field, and the more recent expansion of new technologies and taxonomic scope that comparative psychology has experienced. During the course, students both critique and implement the way in which comparative psychology bridges both subfields of psychology (e.g., neurophysiology, cognition, emotion, perception) and other realms of social sciences and natural sciences (e.g., ethology, behavioral economics, evolutionary biology, artificial intelligence). Prerequisite: Psychology 221 with a grade of at least C-. cross listed: PSYC 385 NEUR 388: Mechanisms of Neural Plasticity) This course studies the remarkable fact that the brain is malleable or changeable. Neurons are constantly altering their behavior at a cellular and molecular level to help us learn, remember, and adapt to new situations. This neuronal plasticity is an essential mechanism of the normal functioning brain but, when plasticity is aberrant, disease is likely to occur. We will examine the mechanisms of neuronal plasticity, probe current techniques utilized by researchers, and evaluate primary research articles. We will consider how plasticity contributes to the learning and encoding of new information throughout the lifespan, as well as how aberrant plasticity contributes to disorders such as post-traumatic stress, addiction, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. We also will explore how these disorders are currently treated with drugs and therapy. Prerequisites: BIOL 221 and PSYC 110 or permission of the instructor. cross listed: BIOL 388, PSYC 388 NEUR 389: Evolution This course will focus on the mechanisms of evolutionary change, ranging from short-term microevolutionary processes within populations to the origins of new species. Topics will include evidence for evolution, short-term microevolutionary processes, natural selection, adaptation, phylogenetic reconstruction, divergence and speciation, 'evo-devo', and human evolution. Classroom sessions will consist of lectures, discussions, and student presentations. Three lecture and four laboratory hours per week (including Field Museum trips). Prerequisites: Biol 220, and either Biol 221 or Junior status. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) cross listed: BIOL 389, BMB 389 NEUR 420: The Neuroscience of Reward \"\"Reward\"\" is a concept with which most people are familiar: a hard-earned vacation at the end of a grueling work schedule, an A grade on a particularly challenging academic assignment, a good meal and a glass of wine after a long day's work. However, this everyday usage of the term belies its complexity. In this course, we will explore \"\"reward\"\" from behavioral and neurobiological perspectives, often focusing on associative learning paradigms that allow for careful dissection of appetitive and consummatory behaviors. We will consider the underlying neural circuitry that enables individuals to learn about rewards and cues that signal these motivationally significant events. Our analysis will emphasize the similarities and distinctions between natural reward and drug reward. Prerequisite: PSYC 222 with a grade of at least C- or advanced standing in another major, with permission of the instructor. Preference in registration to graduating seniors majoring in psychology or neuroscience. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: PSYC 420 NEUR 470: Sr Sem: Telomeres, Race, and Cancer (Senior Seminar: Telomeres, Race, and Cancer.) This course examines telomeres, the tips of chromosomes, which serve a variety of protective cellular functions. Shortened telomeres may lead to decreased lifespan. Telomere length reduction can also be observed in some racial groups, lower socioeconomic groups, and chronically stressed individuals. Conversely, telomeres in some aberrant cells can be lengthened by the enzyme telomerase, leading to cell immortalization and tumor formation. Telomerase is one of the hallmarks of cancer, showing elevated levels in about 90% of tumors. Specific topics depend on student interest and consist of student-led journal clubs, discussions, and a grant proposal project. Prerequisite: Open to senior Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biology, and Neuroscience majors who have completed at least one 300-level course in the major or by permission of the instructor.

Do you remember that scene in The Matrix where Neo downloads the ability to do karate? Ever wondered what was actually \"\"downloaded\"\"? This senior seminar explores the neurobiological mechanisms underlying movement generation and control. We examine how the brain plans and executes movements, the changes that happen when the brain learns new movements, and what happens when these systems go awry (such as in Parkinson's Disease, stroke, spinal cord injuries, and sensory deficits). We also discuss modern techniques to rehabilitate and enhance movement such as brain stimulation and neuro-prosthetics. Precise topics depend on student interests. Students write an original grant proposal, based on which they would design, execute, and present a research project, along with in-class presentations of primary literature. Prerequisite: Open to senior biology and neuroscience majors who have completed core courses and at least one 300-level course in the major or by permission of the instructor.

The course explores physiological, sensory, and behavioral adaptations in animals by the different types of harsh environments they inhabit - the shallowest, the deepest, the coldest, the hottest, and so on - to see how life thrives under challenging conditions. This seminar not only emphasizes animal diversity and unique adaptations, but also how scientists gather information about these animals and communicate their findings to the scientific community and general public. Classes involve discussions stemming from scientific literature, student presentations, and short lectures. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Senior Studies requirement.) cross listed: BIOL 478 NEUR 480: Sr Sem: Neural Frontiers This course is designed to provide a scholarship capstone for biology and neuroscience majors. Students will explore diverse topics of their interest at the frontiers of neuroscience, one of the most active research fields of the 21st century that is regularly considered as science's final frontier. Students will select from topics as diverse as memory, language, cognition, sensation, movement, neural stem cells, and complex neurological diseases. Students will engage in the art of being a scientific scholar in three complementary ways. They will learn new knowledge by discussing the latest primary literature in journal clubs. They will seek new knowledge by authoring an original grant proposal. They will explore how a career in science extends knowledge by role-playing a world famous neuroscientist. Finally students will serve as consultants for First-Year Studies students. Prerequisite: Open to senior biology and neuroscience majors who have completed at least one 300-level course in the major or by permission of the instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Speaking requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) cross listed: BIOL 480 NEUR 481: Sr Sem: Oncology (Senior Seminar: Oncology) This course will examine characteristics of cancer at the cellular and organismal levels, as well as investigate the current methods of treatment and prevention of cancer. This will involve intensive library research, report writing, and student led discussions and presentations. Two 80-minute meetings per week.

This seminar will emphasize theory and empirical tests of theory reported in the primary literature in evolution, behavior, and genetics. Exact topics will depend on student interests. Classes will involve discussions, student presentations, and short lectures. Prerequisite: Open to senior biology and neuroscience majors who have completed at least one 300-level course in the major or by permission of the instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) cross listed: BIOL 482 NEUR 485: Sr Sem: The Nobel Prizes (Senior Seminar: The Nobel Prizes: A Century of Innovation and Discovery) Koch, Fleming, Muller, Watson, Crick, von Bekesy, Golgi, and y Cajal are all Nobel Prize winners. Why are some names known to non-science students, whereas others are not even recognizable to most scientists? Every fall the Nobel Prize committee announces their awards. While their deliberations are shrouded in secrecy, the fame of the award is such that the general public often knows the names of winners. This course will examine the work and life of select prize winners in physiology/medicine and chemistry over the past 100 years. Reading will include the original work by the Novel laureates, as well as biographies and autobiographies of the winners. Discussion, presentations and papers will examine the impact of the winners' work, including a critical analysis of how important the work was at the time and how important it remains today, and why some awards were given years after the work was conducted, while others were recognized within a few years. The course will also include a history of the prize and of Alfred Nobel, and explore controversies associated with the award, including the dearth of female recipients. The semester will conclude with nominations for next year's award winners.
