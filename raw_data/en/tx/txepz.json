Seven of the religious measures were associated bivariately with one or both health indicators. Through two-step OLS regression of each health indicator onto all of the religious measures, adjusting for age and other sociodemographic correlates, two measures of synagogue involvement remained statistically signicant. Follow-up analysis revealed a net health impact of religious observance primarily limited to Orthodox and Conservative Jews. Keywords Religion /C1Health /C1Judaism /C1Survey Introduction By now, three decades of concerted efforts at empirical research have succeeded in accumulating results of thousands of studies of religious correlates or determinants of health (Koenig et al. 2011 ). The considerable diversity in study populations throughout this research has long been noted (Levin 1994 ), with positive ndings present regardless of age, gender, race/ethnicity, social class, study design, or the religious measures or health out- come indicators used in respective investigations. This research is also, for the most part, multi-religious and multi-denominational. As rst reviewed in this journal a quarter cen- tury ago (Levin and Schiller 1987 ), this literature includes numerous studies of Christians from most denominations and communions, including Roman Catholics, Latter-Day Saints, Seventh-day Adventists, and of adherents of other faiths, including Hindus, Bud- dhists, Muslims, new-agers, and even Parsis. However, aside from a few small clusters of focused epidemiologic studies many decades ago (studies of uterine and cervical cancer in J. Levin (&) Institute for Studies of Religion, Baylor University, One Bear Place #97236, Waco, jeff_levin@baylor.edu 123J Relig Health 10.1007/s10943-011-9492-6the 1930s through 1950s and of colitis and enteritis in the 1950s and 1960s), there has been little in the way of programmatic population-based health research on Jews, especially inthe USA. Interest in the broader subject of interconnections between Judaism and health reflects longstanding traditions of rabbinic and scholarly work (see Cutter 2007 ,2011 ; Freeman and Abrams 1999 ; Levin and Prince 2010 ). This includes centuries of rabbinic writing on medical halakhah (Jewish law) (e.g., Jakobovits 1959 ; Rosner 2001 ); decades of t'shuvot ), and other rabbinic (e.g., secular academic (e.g., Zoloth 1999 ) writing on bioethics; at least 20 years of health policy advocacy and com- munity organizing by rabbinic and denominational bodies (e.g., Union for Reform Judaism2007 ); almost 30 years of Jewish health care chaplaincy and organized efforts in pastoral education (e.g., Friedman 2005 ), especially for the aged (e.g., Friedman 2008 ); about 30 years of contemporary writing at the interface of spirituality, healing, and wellness,such as works emphasizing personal growth and self-actualization (e.g., Cooper 1997 ; Hoffman 1981 ), Jewish psychology and meditation (e.g., Kaplan 1985 ), and kabbalistic (esoteric/mystical Jewish) perspectives on health and healing (e.g., Gelberman 2000 ); and a burgeoning Jewish healing movement of the past couple of decades, encompassingcommunity and congregational programing focused on myriad issues in personal andcommunity health and well-being (e.g., Prince 2009 ). All of this work has converged in the mission of the Kalsman Institute on Judaism and Health, an academic center located at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. Yet, despite a wellspring of interest, programmatic research along the lines of the larger religion and health eld has not been forthcoming. This is not to say that there have notbeen excellent empirical studies. Since 1990, study results have documented the health andwell-being of Jews, in the USA and Israel, including ndings from social, behavioral,epidemiologic, clinical, ethnographic, and health services research. Mental health studiesdate back further, highlighted by the famous Midtown Manhattan Study of the 1960s (Sroleand Langner 1962 ). This research, with few exceptions, has been characterized by one-off studies, narrowly focused on specic subjects such as the association between a particularexposure or independent variable and a particular medical or well-being-related outcome in samples enabling subgroup analyses of Jewish respondents or Jewish-gentile comparisons. There is nothing wrong with this, of course, but more fundamental questions about thehealth status of Jews, much less about the Jewish religion's influence on this status, havegone mostly unaddressed. Interest in Judaism and health has emerged quite rapidly in comparison to rise of the larger eld of religion and health research. Yet, unlike the larger eld, Judaism and healthstudies are mostly not characterized by population-based health research. The principalreason is simple: there never has been a national Jewish health census or survey\u2014nothingcomparable to a National Health Interview Survey or National Health and NutritionExamination Survey for the Jewish population in the USA. Existing national health sur-veys, based on proportionally representative probability samples, simply do not contain enough Jewish respondents to enable exploration of specic relationships among study variables, much less elicitation of stable population rates for health outcome indicators.The Israel National Health Survey, conducted in 2002 as a part of the multinational WorldMental Health Survey Initiative, covers the population of Israel only, not the diaspora (seeKessler 2007 ; Levinson et al. 2007 ). Likewise, the World Values Survey contains an Israeli sample, from 2001, but items assessing health were excluded from the Israeli survey. Within the USA, dozens of studies of local Jewish communities have been undertaken over the past quarter century (see Sheskin 2005 ), including community surveys of largeJ Relig Health 123Jewish population centers such as New York, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. These would make excellent resources for religion and health research, but, of course, they cannotprovide national estimates. Moreover, health is one of the least typically included domainsin these surveys and, regardless, questionnaire items are not necessarily comparable acrossthese studies. The best of these community studies, from the perspective of providinghealth data, is the Chicago survey, but it is small and limited in scope, containing only 201adult respondents sampled from a single neighborhood (Benjamins et al. 2006 ). Thus, even as basic a question as, ''How healthy are Jews in the USA?,'' has been unanswerable (Levin and Prince 2010 ), much less, ''How does participation in the religious life of the Jewish community impact on the health and well-being of Jews in the USA?''Investigating these questions is not just an academic exercise; it has important conse-quences for the Jewish population of this country. Results of population-based surveys onhealth, as on many other topics in Jewish life, are crucial for planning communal servicesand programs, for programmatic and capital decisions involved in social services delivery,and for development of nancial resources throughout Jewish communities (Sheskin2005 ). Data-based ndings on health and its correlates, especially, would be of value to both religious congregations and denominational bodies, and to both national organizationsand community agencies. The most promising avenue for exploring religion-health connections among U.S. Jews is one that, to now, has not been exploited. Over the past four decades, the Jewish Fed- erations of North America (formerly United Jewish Communities) has sponsored a seriesof three cross-sectional studies known as the National Jewish Population Survey (NJPS),the most recent one conducted from 2000 to 2001. The NJPS was created in order ''tocollect information on the American Jewish population for communal planning and poli-cymaking purposes and for academic research'' (Kotler-Berkowitz 2006 , p. 387). Con- troversy has surrounded the NJPS, mainly related to its population estimates of the size ofthe U.S. Jewish community (see Kadushin et al. 2005 ; Klaff and Mott 2005 ). There have been concerns expressed that the NJPS underrepresents this population, especially the rightwing of the Orthodox branch of Judaism. Much of the concern about the NJPS sampleinvolves contentious debate over who is a Jew, which entails negotiation of complex issues related to halakhah , rabbinic rulings, and mixed parentage (Kadushin et al. 2005 ). Not to minimize these issues, but for purposes of the present paper, a serendipitous feature of theNJPS is that the most recent sample included two questions enabling both a rough look atthe overall self-assessed health status of American Jews and identication of potentialcorrelates of health from among descriptors of the Jewish population. While the NJPS mayprovide an inexact estimate of total population size, still ''the survey provides valuable datafor analyzing interrelationships between variables .... [t]o help local and national leaders understand which factors are associated with which outcomes'' (Kadushin et al. 2005 , p. 22)\u2014thus, the present paper. The NJPS was not constructed as a health survey, of course, and the two health out- comes measures included offer only a modest take on the health of Jews in the USA. But they are quite useful for substantive analysis of potential correlates of health, especially as the survey contains numerous single items and scales addressing diverse aspects of reli-gious identity, participation, and experience, along with the pertinent sociodemographicindicators for describing the Jewish population. The most recent NJPS thus provides anexcellent opportunity, albeit unanticipated by its developers, to bootstrap a systematic lookat the health impact of Jewish religious observance in the USA.J Relig Health 123Population-Health Research on Judaism Of all the areas of scholarship at the interface of Judaism and health, as outlined above, the least systematically developed involves empirical study of the health impact of Jewishreligious observance. This is not to say that few health- or medical-related studies havebeen conducted among Jews; quite the contrary. A PubMed search on the terms ''Jews,''''Jewish,'' or ''Judaism,'' at the time of the writing, turns up nearly 25,000 hits, includingthousands of empirical studies of one kind or another. But among these are studies largelyunrelated to the Jewish religion\u2014for example, biomedical studies conducted in Israel, invivo or in vitro laboratory experiments or genetic studies undertaken with ethnicallyJewish subjects, and social or behavioral studies comparing Jews and gentiles on health- related life styles, healthcare utilization, rates of morbidity, patient satisfaction, medical decision making, and so on. Far fewer studies have investigated the health impact, inJewish populations, of actual indicators of Jewish religious identity or participation. In the earliest comprehensive review of the religion and health eld (Levin and Schiller 1987 ), dozens of published studies dating back to the nineteenth century were cited which documented a relative advantage or disadvantage among Jews for a range of medicaloutcomes, expressed in terms of both mortality and morbidity (e.g., cumulative incidence)rates. Examples include a seminal article entitled, ''Vital Statistics of the Jews,'' publishedby legendary army surgeon Dr. John Shaw Billings in the North American Review (Billings 1891 ), and an unsigned editorial published a few years later in the British Medical Journal (Anon. 1905 ). Billings was among the earliest medical experts to suggest that religious afliation may be a contributing factor in differential rates of morbidity and mortality among social groups, exemplied by distinctive patterns of morbidity, mortality, andlongevity among Jews. The subsequent editorial also noted this trend, specically inrelation to a lower than expected rate of cancer mortality and higher rates due to diseases ofthe digestive system. These ndings were subsequently borne out and replicated, decades later, through larger scale research and more systematic reviews. A lower relative incidence of uterine andcervical cancer among Jews (and Muslims), for instance, was observed throughout theworld (Kennaway 1948 ); and a higher relative prevalence of ulcerative colitis and regional enteritis among Baltimore Jews was observed and could not be explained by differences insocioeconomic status, marital status, or birthplace (Monk et al. 1969 ) or in life stress, number of residences, birth order, or psychological factors (Monk et al. 1970 ). It is easy to recognize now, decades later, that these Jewish epidemiologic distinctives are due in largepart to the preventive effects of husbands' circumcision and to genetic predisposition,respectively, and not to any purely ''religious'' influence or to the psychological sequelaeof such. But this begs the question of what is implied by ''religious'': male circumcision isa fulllment of the mitzvah (commandment) of celebrating the Abrahamic b'rit (covenant) and thus reflects, at least to a minimal degree, faithfulness to the norms of Jewish religiousobservance. Such observance, in the case of the cancer studies, however, can be understoodto have health implications principally for hygienic reasons related to a primary-preventiveaction that is protective against cervical dysplasia in Jewish women. If there is indeed ahealth benet of practicing Judaism\u2014along the lines of the thousands of religion and health studies in members of other religious groups (see, e.g., Koenig et al. 2011 )\u2014then other evidence must be considered. Evidence of a salutary effect of Jewish identity does exist, but primarily for mental health outcomes and in studies where the focus was not on religious observance. Forexample, data from the New Haven site of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study wereJ Relig Health 123used to examine differences in lifetime prevalence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders among Catholics, Protestants, and Jews (Yeung and Greenwald 1992 ). Findings showed that while there were no religious differences in overall morbidity, there were signicantdifferences for particular disorders. Jews had higher rates of major depression and dys-thymia, and lower rates of alcohol abuse, and were more likely to seek treatment frommental health providers. Efforts to identify a substantively religious effect on health have been undertaken in Israel, with mixed results. In a study of older retirees (Anson et al. 1990 ), a single-item self-rating of religiosity (''To what extent do you observe the religious rituals?'') was only weakly associated with well-being measures, or not at all, and not in a positive direction. Asmall study of residents of a secular and a religious kibbutz (commune) (Anson et al. 1991 ) found that of several religious measures only private prayer had any relation to health orwell-being, and in a negative direction, perhaps reflecting a tendency of people with anillness to turn to God for help. While expertly done, both of these studies are over twodecades old, both focused mostly on psychological well-being, neither was conducted inthe USA, neither involved a sample of respondents from the general population, andneither provided an in-depth examination of Jewish religious observance. More recently, a study of Jewish Israeli students found that high levels of Jewish religious belief (but not behavior) were positively associated with psychological well-being and protective against psychological distress due to the mediating effect of a construct measuring meaning in life, among secular Jews, and due to the mediation of fear ofpunishment in the hereafter, among religious Jews (Vilchinsky and Kravetz 2005 ). A study of urban, middle-aged Israelis found no signicant religiosity gradient in reports of chronicmorbidity, assessed through the SF-36 instrument, and a generally adverse religious effecton other outcomes (Shmueli 2006 ). The religious measure, however, was a single-item have highly contexted meaningsspecic to contemporary Israeli society. These labels are also strongly intertwined in Israelwith socioeconomic status, sociodemographic characteristics, cultural norms, and life stylebehaviors all associated with differential population health risks and disadvantages, so it is not easy to tease out general conclusions here about the health impact of Jewish religious observance. The best look at this issue, methodologically speaking, is also from an Israeli study, one using a large historical prospective cohort for longitudinal analysis (Kark et al. 1996 ). Over a 16-year period, members of 11 religious (Orthodox) kibbutzim had a lower overall mortality rate than members of 11 matched secular kibbutzim , according to Cox propor- tional hazards models that adjusted for age and the matched design. The investigatorsnoted the congruence of these ndings with previous Israeli studies identifying a protec-tive effect of Jewish religious orthodoxy on morbidity due to myocardial infarction(Friedlander et al. 1986 ; Snyder et al. 1978 ). They attributed such results to a combination of lower exposure to conventional risk factors among religious Jews (e.g., smoking, alcohol, and drug abuse) and a protective effect due to amelioration of stress. The latter, they suggested, might result from an ''overall coherent world view and sense of belonging''(p. 345), a relaxation response elicited by frequent ritual prayer, faith in God and belief inGod's authority, less ambivalence and exposure to stressors via a life style characterized byrepetitive ritual behavior, highly stable marriage bonds, and a general sense of well-beingheightened by strengthened coping skills and greater social integration due to living in acohesive religious community.J Relig Health 123These studies, collectively, tell us something about the impact of Jewish identity, especially Orthodox identity, on primarily psychological well-being or related outcomes,with the exception of the study of overall mortality. These studies mostly take place inIsrael and mostly draw on smaller samples, again with the exception of the mortality study.They also do not directly focus on measures of religiousness, but rather on single items thatlocate respondents in a dichotomy or along a continuum of religious afliation. So, despitethese ne studies, a putative protective effect on health of Jewish religious observance, inthe USA or elsewhere, validated with population-based data, remains an open issue. The outstanding recent work of Rosmarin and colleagues also has addressed mental health-related sequelae of traditional Jewish observance, but in a series of smaller psy-chological studies. These investigations have identied higher levels of trust in God(Rosmarin et al. 2009c beliefs practices (Rosmarin et al. 2009a ), and gratitude (Rosmarin et al. 2010 ) as signicantly protective against anxiety and depression among Orthodox Jews, and the experience of high levels of spiritual struggles as predictive ofpoorer physical and mental health in Jews, generally, but of better physical and mentalhealth in the Orthodox (Rosmarin et al. 2009b ). On the whole, this is among the very best empirical research available on Judaism and health, and is both provocative and pro-grammatic, but it does not derive from large population-based data sources. The present study efforts to explore a connection between Judaism and health using data from the most recent NJPS, a large national probability survey of U.S. Jews conductedfrom 2000 to 2001. Because the dataset contains a substantial variety of religious mea-sures, many of them pertinent to Jewish religious observance, as well as a couple ofstandard health status measures, the NJPS is thus an ideal resource for initiating a moresystematic approach to religion and health research in this population, notwithstanding thatthis was not the intention of the survey's developers. In these analyses, both single itemsand newly constructed scales are used that together assess Jewish activities, Jewish reli-gious observance, shul (synagogue) membership and attendance, self-rated religiosity and Jewish observance, the importance of religion, and personal prayer outside of shul. Each of these measures is examined in relation to both a self-rating of overall health and a more functional indicator of the presence of an activity-limiting health condition. Results are presented for both bivariate and multivariable associations, as well as for multivariableassociations adjusting for age and other sociodemographic correlates of both religion andhealth. Also, statistically signicant ndings are further examined in subgroup analysesthrough stratication by Jewish denominational afliation (Reform, Conservative, Ortho-dox, Reconstructionist, and secular). This strategy, using these data, represents the best andmost systematic possible approach to initiating study of a potential health impact of Jewishreligious observance in the USA. It is hoped that results will suggest new more narrowlyfocused research questions that can be explored in subsequent studies, including furtherresearch using the NJPS sample. Methods NJPS 2000-01This paper presents results of analyses using data from the third NJPS, conducted from 2000 to 2001. The rst two NJPS studies were conducted in 1971 and 1990. The NJPS isnot a multi-wave survey project: the three studies are separate cross-sectional surveys, withJ Relig Health 123distinct sampling frames, very different working denitions of Jewish identity, and con- siderable variation in the numbers and contents of constructs included and the wording ofrespective items. The 2000-01 study consisted of a national multistage, stratied, proba-bility telephone survey of 5,148 adult Jewish households, conducted by RoperASW using astrategy of random digit dialing and oversampling of areas of high Jewish populationdensity screened from a larger initial cohort of over 170,000 households (see Kotler-Berkowitz 2006 ; Kadushin et al. 2005 ; Klaff and Mott 2005 ). Much of the complexity, and contentiousness, surrounding the 2000-01 NJPS, sample is related to the issue of Jewish identity (see DellaPergola 2005 ; Kosmin 2005 ). The 2000-01 survey (JCPs), categories,combined, dene the ''core used in the 1990 NJPS. The denitions ofthese categories are complicated and beyond the scope of the present paper; the interestedreader can nd detailed information on the Jewish identity classication scheme elsewhere(e.g., Klaff and Mott 2005 ). A key function of these categories is that they enable researchers the opportunity to construct their own nuanced denitions of Jewishness orJewish identity, if so desired, such as for studies of overall population dynamics andprojections or of patterns of Jewish religious participation. The ''who is Jewish'' questionand efforts to address it in the NJPS thus add greatly to the complexity of the survey, influencing decisions regarding the sampling frame, the questions included, skip patterns, weighting, and so on, and especially how to account for all of this in certain analyses.Serendipitously, PJBs (dened as those individuals with some Jewish background, throughbirth or raising, who belong to another monotheistic religion or who may not currentlyconsider themselves to be Jewish) were excluded from many of the questions on Jewishreligious topics, and thus by necessity excluded from the present analyses. This rendersmuch of the above discussion of Jewish identity moot for the present paper, as it eliminatesthe decision-making calculus that would be involved in so many other studies that mightuse this dataset, but it does serve to lower the available sample size for use here(N=4,484). Measures Health IndicatorsThe NJPS contains two measures of health status: a single item assessing self-rated health (''Would you say your health, in general, is recoded as: 1 =poor, 2 =fair, 3=good, 4 =excellent) and a single item assessing presence of an activity -limiting health condition (''Do you currently have any kind of physical, mental, or other health condition that limits employment, education, or daily activities, and has lasted for at least 6 months?''; recoded, in combination with two other variant items related to household size, as: 0 =no, 1 =yes). The self-rated health item is commonly included in population health surveys, and the version included in the NJPS is the standard form. Single-itemmeasures of disability or activity limitation are less commonly used today in health sur-veys, but have been included in social surveys dating back to the 1970s. The average levelof health status reported by NJPS respondents (as indicated in Table 1) and the distribution of self-rated health in this sample (4.8% poor, 13.0% fair, 40.1% good, 42.1% excellent)have been found to converge with levels found in African Americans and are slightly lowerthan that of U.S. Whites (Pearson and Geronimus 2010 ).J Relig Health 123Table 1 Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlations for study variables Study variables 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Mean SD 1.

These include assessment of discrete beliefs, attitudes, and values about Judaism, Jews, and Israelthat were not a priori expected to be of substantive relevance to the state of one's physicalhealth. Selected religious measures, on the other hand, are very much in keeping with thekinds of indicators of religious identity, behavior, and self-assessment that have been usedfor decades in studies of the determinants of health. In the present analyses, eight measuresare used, two of which are original multiple-item scales developed for use in this paper. The Jewish Activities Scale is a six-item index ( a=.70) comprising dichotomous variables (recoded as: 0 1 =yes) assessing Jewish activities conducted with a past- year time referent. These include, ''Read a Jewish newspaper, magazine, or other publi- cation,'' ''Listen to a tape, CD, or record because it contained Jewish content,'' ''See amovie or rent a video because it had Jewish content,'' ''Read a book, other than the Bible,because it had Jewish content,'' ''Use the Internet for Jewish-related information,'' and,''[A]ttend any adult Jewish education classes or any other kind of adult Jewish learning,such as synagogue programs, a book group, a study group at home or work, or a Biblestudy group, but excluding any college course you may have taken.'' TheJewish Observance Scale is a nine-item index ( a=.77) comprising variables using a variety of response categories and coding schemes (all recoded as: 0 =no, 1 =yes), all of which assess indicators of Jewish observance according to various time referents. Theseinclude, ''How often, if at all, does anyone in your household light Sabbath candles on Friday night?,'' ''Last Passover, did you hold or attend a seder?,'' ''Last Hannukah, how many nights, if any, did you participate in lighting of Hannukah candles, either in or out ofyour home?,'' ''Do you keep Kosher in your home ?,'' ''During the last Yom Kippur, did you personally fast?,'' ''If you ever had a close relative who passed away, other than thefuneral, did you observe any of the Jewish mourning or memorial ritual, such as sittingshiva, saying Kaddish or going to synagogue?,'' ''Is there a mezuzah on any door of yourhome?,'' ''In 1999, did (you)/(anyone in your household) make a monetary contribution toa UJA-Federation campaign?,'' and, ''In 1999, did (you)/(anyone in your household) makea monetary contribution to any Jewish charity or cause, other than the UJA-Federation,such as a synagogue, Jewish school or group supporting Israel? Please do not include dues,memberships, or Israel Bonds.'' In addition, six single-item Jewish religious indicators are used. These include impor- tance of religion (''How important is religion in your life today?''; recoded as: 1 =not at all important, 2 3 =somewhat, 4 =very), synagogue member (''[Are you]/[Is anyone in your household] currently a member of a synagogue or temple?''; recoded as:0=no, 1 =yes), self-rated religiosity (''In general, you say you are personally?''; recoded as: 1 =not at all religious, 3 =somewhat, 4=very), self-rated Jewish observance (''In terms of observance , that is following the rituals and practices of Judaism, would you say you are ...?''; recoded as: 1 =not at all observant, 2 =not 3 =somewhat, 4 =very), personal prayer outside shul (''Other than attending religious services, do you ever pray using your own words?''; recoded as:0=no, 1 =yes), and synagogue attendance (''Did you personally attend any type of synagogue, temple, or organized Jewish religious service during the past year ?; recoded as: 0=no, 1 = yes). In supplementary analyses (described in the Findings section, below), a Jewish religious denomination variable was used for stratication. This was created from the more than two dozen response categories used for the survey question, ''Thinking about Jewish religiousJ Relig Health 123denominations, do you consider yourself to be ...?'' For the present paper, the variable categories were Reform ( N=1,415, 31.6% of the total sample), Conservative (including the few respondents who reported Conservadox or Traditional; N=1,121, 25.0%), Orthodox (including (a combination of respondents reporting the categories of secular, culturally Jewish,Humanistic [Jew], non-practicing Jew, agnostic, atheist, or no religion/none; N=267, 6.0%). Analyses The present paper aims to provide the fullest possible perspective on relationships between Jewish religious measures and health outcome indicators. Accordingly, associationsbetween respective independent and dependent variables are presented bivariately, mul-tivariably (accounting for simultaneous effects of all religious indicators), and multivari-ably adjusting for covariates. All analyses are conducted using SAS version 9.2. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlations are computed using the UNIVARIATE and CORR procedures, respectively. A strategy of two-step OLS regression is used to model effects of the eight religious measures on each health outcome variable, using theREG procedure. In Model I, all of the religious measures are entered together. In Model II,the analysis is rerun, adding in measures of covariate factors. This two-step process isconducted separately for self-rated health and activity-limiting health condition. Four sociodemographic variables are used as covariates in Model II analyses. These include age(in years), gender (recoded as: 0 =male, 1 =female), marital (recoded as: 0 =not married and living together [combining widowed, divorced, separated, and single/never married], 1 =married and living together), and education (highest degree or year of school completed; 17 categories collapsed to 9). Each of these variables has beenassociated with religious indicators and health-related outcomes in thousands of studies, and is routinely adjusted for in empirical research on the determinants of health, especially age. Findings Table 1contains descriptive statistics and Pearson correlations for all study variables. A few notable ndings can be observed. First, out of 28 possible intercorrelations among theeight Jewish religious measures, all 28 are statistically signicant, in a positive direction,and most of these are of substantial magnitude. In other words, a higher level of Jewishreligious engagement according to any given indicator or scale is associated with greater religious participation or observance according to every other measure. Second, seven of the eight religious measures are signicantly associated with one or both of the healthindicators. Four of these\u2014the Jewish Activities Scale, the Jewish Observance Scale,synagogue membership, and synagogue attendance\u2014are each associated with better self-rated health and the absence of an activity-limiting health condition. By contrast, personalprayer outside of shul is associated with poorer health according to both measures, perhaps because prayer here is being used as a response to a health challenge and a means topetition God for healing. For perhaps the same reason, a higher self-rating of the impor-tance of religion is associated with a health condition. Without the benet of longitudinaldata, however, this interpretation cannot be conrmed.J Relig Health 123In prevalence study data, one must be careful in interpreting bivariate ndings impli- cating potential correlates of health indicators, especially measures of the functionaldomain of health. Identied behavioral correlates of functional health that themselvesrequire a degree of functional health to perform may attain statistical signicance, in part,due to methodological artifact rather than fully due to substantive signicance. Geronto-logical research and studies of aging must confront this, especially. This issue was rstdiscussed in earnest in the context of religion and health studies back in the 1980s.Statistically signicant, positive associations between certain religious measures, notably those requiring public participation and thus ambulation (e.g., frequent attendance at worship service), may reflect the possibility that measures of public participation in reli-gion are in part proxy measures of functional health itself. Measures of more privatereligious observances or of subjective religious beliefs or attitudes would not be affected inthe same way. This observation has led to use of longitudinal designs to investigate theseassociations and, where this is not possible, such as in the present study, has encouragedcareful adjustment for age. This was an important consideration in the present study, asboth health indicators are signicantly age-related (although, interestingly, both measuresof synagogue involvement, the strongest correlates of health in this study, are not). Table 2contains results of two-step OLS regressions of each health indicator onto all eight religious indicators and scales (Model I), and then repeated adding in the four covariates, including age (Model II). Together with the results in Table 1, the approach enables comparison of the impact of each religious measure on each of the two healthindicators under three conditions: bivariately, multivariably (in the presence of all otherreligious measures, but unadjusted for sociodemographic covariates), and multivariablyand adjusted (i.e., controlling for effects of the covariates, including age). These resultssuggest that the impact of synagogue involvement on health, observed in Table 1,i so f substantive as well as statistical signicance. For self-rated health, both synagogue membership ( b=.09,P\\.001) and synagogue attendance ( b=.08,P\\.001) are signicant correlates, even after controlling for effects of the other religious measures, which are simultaneously entered. Moreover, the signi-cant effect for synagogue membership remains at the net level (i.e., Model II) ( b=.07, P\\.001), after adjusting for age and the other covariates. This effect is thus observed even after controlling for the possibility of age-related declines in physical function, whichmight limit involvement at synagogue, not a trifling matter given a strong net effect of ageon self-rated health ( b=- .34,P\\.001) that helped to explain away the signicant gross effect of attendance. Keep in mind, as well, that synagogue membership is the strongest correlate of all the religious measures and, unlike attendance at services, does not implyregular active public participation. This is mirrored in the signicant net effect for theJewish Observance Scale ( b=.10,P\\.001), also a marker of religious commitment but emphasizing private home observances. A few other variables (personal prayer, Jewishactivities, and self-rated religiosity) exhibit small inverse net associations with self-ratedhealth, perhaps for reasons identied in the discussion of Table 1results, above, but these effect sizes are very modest. For presence of an activity-limiting health condition, much the same picture holds, but less nuanced. The only statistically signicant religious measure at both the gross and netlevels is synagogue attendance, a higher score on which is associated with better health(Model I: b=- .07,P\\.001; at the gross level ( b=- .04,P\\.05), but adjustment for age and the other covariates reduce this to non-signicance. The interesting result here, again, is thepresence of a modest but signicant impact of synagogue involvement on a measure ofJ Relig Health 123Table 2 Multiple regressions of health variables on religious indicators and sociodemographic covariates Religious indicators & covariates Self-rated health Activity-limiting health condition Model I Model II Model I Model II b (SE) b b (SE) b b (SE) b b (SE) b Jewish activities scale .01 (.01) .01 -.02* (.01) -.04 -.00 (.00) -.01 .00 (.00) .03 Jewish observance scale (.01) .03 .03*** (.01) .10 -.00 (.00) -.01 -.01* (.00) -.06 Importance of religion -.02 (.02) -.02 .01 (.02) .01 .01 (.01) .04 .01 (.01) .02 Synagogue member .16*** (.04) .09 .12*** (.03) (.02) -.03 -.04 (.02) -.04 .00 (.01) .00 .00 outside shul -.07* (.03) -.04 -.08** (.03) -.04 .01 (.01) (.04) .08 .06 .13*** Relig Health 123health, this time a ''harder'' measure of functional health, net of other salutary features of religiousness as well as accounting for age, which is strongly associated with the healthoutcome variable, even at the net level ( b=.24,P\\.001). These interesting, robust, and consistent ndings for synagogue involvement on health raise an additional question of Jewish demography that also can be addressed here: is theapparent health-related salience of afliation with the life of a shul a function of the type of shul? That is, are these signicant net associations of synagogue membership and atten- dance on self-rated health and of attendance on the presence of an activity-limiting health condition specic to a particular branch of Judaism, or are they more universal? Accordingly, these analyses were rerun, stratifying on a ve-category measure of Jewishdenomination (Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, Reconstructionist, and secular). Results(not reported in the table) revealed considerable denominational variation. Neither synagogue variable is a signicant correlate of self-rated health for Reform, Reconstructionist, or secular Jews. Among Conservative Jews, synagogue attendance issignicant at both the gross ( b=.15,P\\.001) and net ( b=.08,P\\.05) levels; among Orthodox Jews, synagogue membership is signicant at both the gross ( b=.20,P\\.01) and net ( b=.16,P\\.05) levels. Interestingly, among Reform Jews, there are signicant gross ( b=.09,P\\.05) and net ( b=.16,P.\\001) effects for the Jewish Observance Scale. In sum, if there is a net impact of synagogue involvement on self-rated health, it is apparently most salient in Jews afliated with more Torah-observant branches of Judaism; if there is any health impact of religion to be had among Reform Jews, it is a consequenceonly of living a life with greater ritual observance. For presence of an activity-limiting health condition, once again neither synagogue variable is of any net health consequence for Reform or secular Jews. Among ConservativeJews, synagogue attendance has both gross ( b=- .11, P\\.01) and net ( b=- .07, P\\.05) effects; among Orthodox Jews, the synagogue variables do not matter, but the Jewish Activities Scale has a signicant gross effect ( b=- .14,P\\.05), and the Jewish Observance Scale has a signicant net effect ( b=- .16,P\\.05). The strongest impact of either synagogue variable in any branch of Judaism, interestingly, is for synagogueattendance among Reconstructionists, with very strong gross ( b=- .53,P\\.001) and net (b=- .45, P\\.01) effects. In sum, for this functional health variable, as well, if there are benets to be had from religious involvement, net of the potential confounding effects ofage-related health declines, then they are more likely to be observed among more membersof more generally observant branches of Judaism and are less likely, if at all present,among more liberal or secular Jews. Discussion The most interesting nding from these analyses is the importance of synagogue partici- pation for health, but primarily for those Jews who, presumably, value traditional forms of Jewish observance. Like most empirical ndings on the subject of religion and health, theinterpretation is more nuanced: results are not identical for both health variables, effectsizes are mostly modest, and health benets would seem to accrue to Conservative as wellas Orthodox Jews (and, in one instance, to Reconstructionists). But, caveats aside, theseresults seem clear that for more liberal or unafliated Jews, the practice of religion,especially as dened by participation in synagogue life, does not exhibit the same bene-cial salience for physical well-being that it does among Jews who are members of moreobservant branches of Judaism.J Relig Health 123What is it about Conservative and Orthodox Judaism that would produce these results? Or, rather, what is it about the most liberal and secular Jews that would makes sense of anabsence of an instrumental function of religion for health among them? In the studies ofRosmarin and colleagues and in the studies of Israeli kibbutzim , cited earlier, the signicant divide was between Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews, but that is precisely how data werestratied, a priori, and how analyses were conducted; all liberal branches of Judaism weregrouped together, along with non-afliated Jews. In so doing, perhaps some additionalvariation was lost. What, then, do Conservative and Orthodox Jews share that would help to make sense of these ndings. For one, there is a mutual afrmation of one's shul as a place to fulll communal covenantal obligations grounded in ritual practices; there are particular mitzvot that must be observed, at regular intervals, and that can only occur in the presence of aminyan (10-person/man quorum) at synagogue. Moreover, the sanctity of the shul and the congregation, as well as the spiritual fate of congregants in the world to come, if you will,depends in no small part on these covenantal obligations being fullled. Granted, thenature of how certain mitzvot are performed, even dened, varies between Conservative and Orthodox Jews\u2014but this is a theological issue. Yes, Conservative Jews differ fromthe Orthodox on their understanding of and approach to halakhah , yet, they are not explicitly post- halakhic in the way that the other liberal branches are; Jewish law is interpreted differently and more leniently, some would say, by the rabbis, but in that revised form is nonetheless binding. In other words, both Conservative and OrthodoxJews, ideally, share a buy-in to a religious ethos that makes divinely sanctioned demandson behavior and that sancties (and insists on) expressions of piety for both personal andcommunal ends. So, despite very signicant theological disagreement, there may be a genuine psycho- social convergence among individual Conservative and Orthodox Jews that would help tomake sense of a heightened sense of well-being fostered by participation in the life of asynagogue. This is not to say that religious involvement is not a salient force for well-beingamong Reform Jews, but, in this study, the synagogue variables had no impact. Rather, forReform Jews, it was greater personal observance that mattered most: the higher the scores on the Jewish Observance Scale, the better one's health. Until a national Jewish health census or survey is conducted in the USA, or a world Jewish health survey undertaken, these present analyses suggest a fruitful way to bootstrapa means of estimating the contributions of religious observance to health in other Jewishsamples of national scope, including in Israel and the non-U.S. diaspora. For example,these analyses could be replicated in the Gallup World Poll's Israel sample, which includesmeasures of physical health and psychological well-being, as well as in the Israel NationalHealth Survey and the many U.S. Jewish community surveys conducted over the past20 years. The present ndings also underscore the importance of stratifying by Jewishmovement (i.e., denomination) in empirical analyses of the well-being of Jews. Only afterexamining the few modest ndings from the overall sample in this way were the most interesting observations able to be made. But, still, the question remains: what do these ndings mean? From the earliest reviews of the religion and health eld (Levin and Schiller 1987 ), a distinct health advantage was observed among adherents to religions or communions thatmake strict behavioral demands. These included Latter-Day Saints, Seventh-day Advent-ists, and regular communicants in the Roman Catholic Church, and as well as clergy of allfaiths. One of the ways that religious involvement impacts on health is through the kind ofreligious belief system that requires a buy-in or commitment strong enough to lead toJ Relig Health 123changes in health-related behavior\u2014and, of course, through a religion that makes such demands in the rst place. This explanation has been invoked to help to explain thesignicant health advantage, epidemiologically speaking, for Latter-day Saints andAdventists especially in relation to cancer morbidity (Gardner et al. 1995 ). As has been noted by sociologists (e.g., Stark and Bainbridge 1987 ), as well, aside from any advantage in motivating and sanctioning healthy behavior, religions that make high demands onmembers do better than low-demand religions as conduits for values and beliefs. These, inturn, may influence health status through myriad channels: encouraging health-directed behavior, preventive healthcare use, medical compliance, and receptivity to health-pro- motive messages, as well as providing worldviews that engender hope in the future(including the next life), assist in coping with serious life challenges, and give meaning andcontext to the vicissitudes of life and make them more endurable (see George et al. 2002 ; Idler 1987 ; Levin 1996 ; Levin and Vanderpool 1987 ). If so, then it is not surprising to observe population-wide benets of religious participation for well-being, whether psy-chological or even physical. These influences need not be present for every member of these cohorts (e.g., religious Jews) in a given sample for a population-wide effect to be observed. In epidemiologiccontext, we are dealing with population-wide averages. So in that sense we can indeedconclude that for Orthodox Jews, generally, who are more likely to be orthoprax in terms of commitment to a Torah-observant life style than Jews in the other denominational categories, participation in synagogue life\u2014whether through active involvement in dav- vening (prayer) or simply through afliating with a shul\u2014has observable implications for health. Accordingly, signicant implications are also observable for Conservative andReconstructionist Jews, but are lower in magnitude, in keeping with their lesser ortho-praxy, on average, than Orthodox Jews. Similarly, for Reform and secular Jews, groupswhich endorse\u2014again, on average\u2014less formal, ritual observance still, Jewish participa-tion does not have much to say about physical well-being, although, as noted, for ReformJews who are more ritually engaged there is an incremental benet over and above lessobservant members. The NJPS has been critiqued for underrepresenting the right wing of Orthodoxy\u2014not necessarily by intent, but by dint of difculties in accessing that population for inclusion in a sampling frame. If so, then this methodological artifact might account for the similaritiesbetween Conservative and Orthodox Jews, as the latter are overwhelmingly ModernOrthodox in this sample, and thus closer in levels of observance, and socioeconomicallyand culturally, to more traditionally observant Conservative Jews. Were a broader spec-trum of Orthodoxy better represented, we might have found more of a divergence betweenConservative and Orthodox Jews in the instrumental effects of religious observance forwell-being, while still maintaining the gulf between both groups and the other branches ofJudaism. Were mental health variables available in this dataset, then an effort also couldhave been made to replicate some of the ndings of Rosmarin and colleagues regarding thedistinctive well-being prole of Orthodox Jews. Instead, only the two physical health variables were included, which limited the scope of these analyses, although the national sampling frame was a very welcome benet. Nor does the NJPS contain measures of healthbehaviors as are commonplace in large-scale health surveys; thus, there is no way to usethese data to validate the mechanisms by which religion and health are connected in thissample, as speculated above. These are the kinds of trade-offs that one encounters inconducting research on Judaism and health and are among the considerations that argue fora comprehensive health survey of the entire Jewish population.J Relig Health 123References Anon.
