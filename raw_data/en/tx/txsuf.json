Tenku Ruff Thursday, September 29th, 2022 | 7:00pm - 9:00pm ET These days, many people find themselves at the edge of either excess anxiety or ongoing depression. It can be hard to find our way through. The Buddha once asked his disciple, Sona, a former lute player, about properly tuning the lute. Ven. Sona replied that for tuneful and harmonious sounds, the strings should be \"not too tight, not too loose.\" So it is with our meditation practice, and with our lives. How can we find a balance between striving and slackness? When our minds are in balance and still, the path is clear; when we are either too fervently bent on understanding \"something\" or when we are weary\u2014in body or in mind\u2014the path can be harder to see. On this evening of practice Tenku Ruff Osho will focus on finding balance, allowing our bodies show us the way, and letting go of the places where we feel stuck.
