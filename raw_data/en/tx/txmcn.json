It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist. All medicines and vaccines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you being given PNEUMOVAX 23 against the benefits they expect it will have for you. If you have any concerns about being given this vaccine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. What PNEUMOVAX 23 is used for PNEUMOVAX 23 is a vaccine used to help prevent infections caused by certain types of germs or bacteria called pneumococcus (pronounced new-mo-kock-us). PNEUMOVAX 23 helps protect against the most common types of pneumococcal bacteria. PNEUMOVAX 23 is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. It can be given to children 2 years of age and older, teenagers and adults who: - have no spleen or a spleen that does not function properly, including sickle cell disease - have a decreased immune system and are at increased risk of pneumococcal infection, for example, people with organ transplants, HIV or certain cancers - have long-term diseases and are at increased risk of pneumococcal infection - have leakage of fluid from around the brain and spinal cord It can also be given to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over 50 years of age. In addition, PNEUMOVAX 23 is recommended as a routine vaccination for people aged 65 years and older. Pneumococcal infection is an important cause of death worldwide. Protection against pneumococcal infection is important because the germs or bacteria can cause serious diseases such as: - meningitis, an infection of the brain and/or spinal cord - pneumonia, an infection of the lungs - a severe infection of the middle ear - a severe infection in the blood. Groups of people who are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease include those who have poor immune systems, such as people with organ transplants, certain cancers and HIV/AIDS. Other people who are at risk of pneumococcal disease include those with no spleen, those with long-term problems of the heart, lung, kidney or liver, diabetes mellitus, alcoholics and people aged 65 years and older, and those who smoke. In Australia, the vaccine is currently recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for tobacco smokers. Infection from pneumococcal bacteria usually occurs when you come into contact with an infected person. The infection may be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes near another person. Apart from certain diseases, other situations that may increase the risk of infection include: - being around groups of other children (e.g. Daycare) - living in the same household as someone who is infected. How it works PNEUMOVAX 23 works by causing your body to produce its own protection against pneumococcal infection. It does this by making disease-fighting substances called antibodies to fight the bacteria. The vaccine itself cannot cause the infection. If a vaccinated person comes into contact with live bacteria, the body is usually ready and produces antibodies to destroy it. However, as with all vaccines, 100% protection against pneumococcal disease cannot be guaranteed. The chance of a severe reaction from PNEUMOVAX 23 is very small, but the risks from not being vaccinated may be very serious. PNEUMOVAX 23 only protects against infections caused by the most common types of pneumococcal bacteria, not against the less common types of pneumococcal bacteria or other germs. Before you are given PNEUMOVAX 23 When you or your child must not be given it Do not have PNEUMOVAX 23 if: - you have an allergy to PNEUMOVAX 23 or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet - the expiry date on the pack has passed If the vaccine is used after the expiry date has passed, it may not work.

PNEUMOVAX 23 should not be given at the same time as ZOSTAVAX\u00ae. For more information about these vaccines, talk to your doctor or health care provider, because it may be better to get these vaccines at least 4 weeks apart. Your doctor will advise you if you are taking or receiving any of these or other medicines that decrease the immune system. Your doctor will decide whether or not to give the vaccine.

The dose of the vaccine is the same for everyone. Usually only one injection is needed to help protect against pneumococcal disease. However, if you are at increased risk of serious pneumococcal infection, you may need to have a second injection. Your doctor will decide if and when you need a second injection of PNEUMOVAX 23. How it is given PNEUMOVAX 23 is given as an injection by a doctor or trained nurse, either into a muscle, such as your upper arm or mid-thigh, or under the skin.
