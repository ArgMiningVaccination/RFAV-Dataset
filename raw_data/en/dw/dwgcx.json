In the interests of clarity and rationality, the said Directives should therefore be codifiedby assembling them in a single text. (2) The essential aim of any rules governing the production, distri-bution and use of medicinal products must be to safeguard publichealth. (3) However, this objective must be attained by means which willnot hinder the development of the pharmaceutical industry ortrade in medicinal products within the Community. (4) Trade in medicinal products within the Community is hinderedby disparities between certain national provisions, in particularbetween provisions relating to medicinal products (excludingsubstances or combinations of substances which are foods,animal feeding-stuffs or toilet preparations), and such disparitiesdirectly affect the functioning of the internal market. (5) Such hindrances must accordingly be removed; whereas thisentails approximation of the relevant provisions. (6) In order to reduce the disparities which remain, rules should belaid down on the control of medicinal products and the dutiesincumbent upon the Member States' competent authorities shouldbe specified with a view to ensuring compliance with legalrequirements. (7) The concepts of harmfulness and therapeutic efficacy can only beexamined in relation to each other and have only a relativesignificance depending on the progress of scientific knowledgeand the use for which the medicinal product is intended. The particulars and documents which must accompany an application for marketing authorization for a medicinal product demonstratethat potential risks are outweighed by the therapeutic efficacy ofthe product. (8) Standards and protocols for the performance of tests and trials onmedicinal products are an effective means of control of theseproducts and hence of protecting public health and can facilitatethe movement of these products by laying down uniform rulesapplicable to tests and trials, the compilation of dossiers and theexamination of applications. (9) Experience has shown that it is advisable to stipulate moreprecisely the cases in which the results of toxicological andpharmacological tests or clinical trials do not have to beprovided with a view to obtaining authorization for a medicinalproduct which is essentially similar to an authorized product,while ensuring that innovative firms are not placed at a disad-vantage. (10) However, there are reasons of public policy for not conductingrepetitive tests on humans or animals without over-riding cause. (11) The adoption of the same standards and protocols by all theMember States will enable the competent authorities to arriveat their decisions on the basis of uniform tests and by reference B2001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u20143 (1) OJ L 113, 30.4.1992, p. 8. (2) OJ L 113, 30.4.1992, p. 13. (3) OJ L 297, 13.10.1992, p. 8.to uniform criteria and will therefore help to avoid differences in evaluation. (12) With the exception of those medicinal products which are subject to the centralized Community authorization procedure established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 layingdown Community procedures for the authorization and super-vision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use andestablishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of MedicinalProducts ( 1) a marketing authorization for a medicinal product granted by a competent authority in one Member State oughtto be recognized by the competent authorities of the otherMember States unless there are serious grounds for supposingthat the authorization of the medicinal product concerned maypresent a risk to public health. In the event of a disagreementbetween Member States about the quality, the safety or theefficacy of a medicinal product, a scientific evaluation of thematter should be undertaken according to a Communitystandard, leading to a single decision on the area of disagreementbinding on the Member States concerned. Whereas this decision should be adopted by a rapid procedure ensuring close coop- eration between the Commission and the Member States. (13) For this purpose, a Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Productsshould be set up attached to the European Agency for theEvaluation of Medicinal Products established in the abovemen-tioned Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93. (14) This Directive represents an important step towards achievement of the objective of the free movement of medicinal products. Further measures may abolish any remaining barriers to thefree movement of proprietary medicinal products will benecessary in the light of experience gained, particularly in theabovementioned Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products. (15) In order better to protect public health and avoid any unnecessaryduplication of effort during the examination of application for amarketing authorization for medicinal products, Member Statesshould systematically prepare assessment reports in respect ofeach medicinal product which is authorized by them, andexchange the reports upon request. Furthermore, a Member State should be able to suspend the examination of an application for authorization to place a medicinal product on the marketwhich is currently under active consideration in anotherMember State with a view to recognizing the decision reachedby the latter Member State. (16) Following the establishment of the internal market, specificcontrols to guarantee the quality of medicinal products importedfrom third countries can be waived only if appropriatearrangements have been made by the Community to ensure thatthe necessary controls are carried out in the exporting country. (17) It is necessary to adopt specific provisions for immunologicalmedicinal products, homeopathic medicinal products, radiophar-maceuticals, and medicinal products based on human blood orhuman plasma. (18) Any rules governing radiopharmaceuticals must take into accountthe provisions of Council Directive 84/466/Euratom of 3September 1984 laying down basic measures for the radiationprotection of persons undergoing medical examination ortreatment ( 2). Account should also be taken of Council Directive 80/836/Euratom of 15 July 1980 amending theB2001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u20144 (1) OJ L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 1. Regulation as amended by Commission Regu- lation (EC) No 649/98 (OJ L 88, 24.3.1998, p. 7). (2) OJ L 265, 5.10.1984, p. 1. Directive repealed with effect from 13 May 2000 by Directive 97/43/Euratom (OJ L 180, 9.7.1997, p. 22).Directives laying down the basic safety standards for the health protection of the general public and workers against the dangersof ionizing radiation ( 1), the objective of which is to prevent the exposure of workers or patients to excessive or unnecessarilyhigh levels of ionizing radiation, and in particular of Article 5cthereof, which requires prior authorization for the addition ofradioactive substances to medicinal products as well as for theimportation of such medicinal products. (19) The Community entirely supports the efforts of the Council ofEurope to promote voluntary unpaid blood and plasma donationto attain self-sufficiency throughout the Community in the supplyof blood products, and to ensure respect for ethical principles intrade in therapeutic substances of human origin. (20) The rules designed to guarantee the quality, safety and efficacy ofmedicinal products derived from human blood or human plasmamust be applied in the same manner to both public and privateestablishments, and to blood and plasma imported from thirdcountries. (21) Having regard to the particular characteristics of these homeo-pathic medicinal products, such as the very low level of activeprinciples they contain and the difficulty of applying to them theconventional statistical methods relating to clinical trials, it isdesirable to provide a special, simplified registration procedurefor those homeopathic medicinal products which are placed on the market without therapeutic indications in a pharmaceutical form and dosage which do not present a risk for the patient. (22) The anthroposophic medicinal products described in an officialpharmacopoeia and prepared by a homeopathic method are to betreated, as regards registration and marketing authorization, in the same way as homeopathic medicinal products. (23) It is desirable in the first instance to provide users of these homeopathic medicinal products with a very clear indication oftheir homeopathic character and with sufficient guarantees oftheir quality and safety. (24) The rules relating to the manufacture, control and inspection ofhomeopathic medicinal products must be harmonized to permitthe circulation throughout the Community of medicinal productswhich are safe and of good quality. (25) The usual rules governing the authorization to market medicinalproducts should be applied to homeopathic medicinal productsplaced on the market with therapeutic indications or in a formwhich may present risks which must be balanced against thedesired therapeutic effect. In particular, those Member Stateswhich have a homeopathic tradition should be able to applyparticular rules for the evaluation of the results of tests andtrials intended to establish the safety and efficacy of these medicinal products provided that they notify them to the Commission. (26) In order to facilitate the movement of medicinal products and toprevent the controls carried out in one Member State from beingrepeated in another, minimum requirements should be laid down for manufacture and imports coming from third countries and for the grant of the authorization relating thereto. (27) It should be ensured that, in the Member States, the supervisionand control of the manufacture of medicinal products is carriedout by a person who fulfils minimum conditions of qualification. B2001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u20145 (1) OJ L 246, 17.9.1980, p. 1. Directive as amended by Directive 84/467/Euratom (OJ L 265, 5.10.1984, p. 4), repealed with effect from 13May 2000 by Directive 96/29/Euratom (OJ L 314, 4.12.1996, p. 20).(28) Before an authorization to market an immunological medicinal product or derived from human blood or human plasma can begranted, the manufacturer must demonstrate his ability to attainbatch-to-batch consistency. Before an authorization to market amedicinal product derived from human blood or human plasmacan be granted, the manufacturer must also demonstrate theabsence of specific viral contamination, to the extent that thestate of technology permits. (29) The conditions governing the supply of medicinal products to thepublic should be harmonized. (30) In this connection persons moving around within the Communityhave the right to carry a reasonable quantity of medicinalproducts lawfully obtained for their personal use. It must alsobe possible for a person established in one Member State toreceive from another Member State a reasonable quantity ofmedicinal products intended for his personal use. (31) In addition, by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 2309/93, certainmedicinal products are the subject of a Community marketingauthorization. In this context, the classification for the supplyof medicinal products covered by a Community marketingauthorization needs to be established. It is therefore importantto set the criteria on the basis of which Community decisions will be taken. (32) It is therefore appropriate, as an initial step, to harmonize the basic principles applicable to the classification for the supply ofmedicinal products in the Community or in the Member Stateconcerned, while taking as a starting point the principlesalready established on this subject by the Council of Europe aswell as the work of harmonization completed within theframework of the United Nations, concerning narcotic andpsychotropic substances. (33) The provisions dealing with the classification of medicinalproducts for the purpose of supply do not infringe the nationalsocial security arrangements for reimbursement or payment formedicinal products on prescription. (34) Many operations involving the wholesale distribution of medicinal products for human use may cover several Member States simultaneously. (35) It is necessary to exercise control over the entire chain of distri-bution of medicinal products, from their manufacture or importinto the Community through to supply to the public, so as toguarantee that such products are stored, transported and handledin suitable conditions. The requirements which must be adoptedfor this purpose will considerably facilitate the withdrawal ofdefective products from the market and allow more effectiveefforts against counterfeit products. (36) Any person involved in the wholesale distribution of medicinalproducts should be in possession of a special authorization. Phar-macists and persons authorized to supply medicinal products tothe public, and who confine themselves to this activity, should beexempt from obtaining this authorization. It is however necessary, in order to control the complete chain of distribution of medicinal products, that pharmacists and persons authorized to supplymedicinal products to the public keep records showing trans-actions in products received. (37) Authorization must be subject to certain essential conditions andit is the responsibility of the Member State concerned to ensurethat such conditions are met; whereas each Member State mustrecognize authorizations granted by other Member States. B2001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u20146(38) Certain Member States impose on wholesalers who supply medicinal products to pharmacists and on persons authorized tosupply medicinal products to the public certain public serviceobligations. Those Member States must be able to continue toimpose those obligations on wholesalers established within theirterritory. They must also be able to impose them on wholesalersin other Member States on condition that they do not impose anyobligation more stringent than those which they impose on their own wholesalers and provided that such obligations may be regarded as warranted on grounds of public health protectionand are proportionate in relation to the objective of suchprotection. (39) Rules should be laid down as to how the labelling and packageleaflets are to be presented. (40) The provisions governing the information supplied to usersshould provide a high degree of consumer protection, in orderthat medicinal products may be used correctly on the basis of fulland comprehensible information. (41) The marketing of medicinal products whose labelling andpackage leaflets comply with this Directive should not beprohibited or impeded on grounds connected with the labellingor package leaflet. (42) This Directive is without prejudice to the application of measuresadopted pursuant to Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10September 1984 relating to the approximation of the laws, regu-lations and administrative provisions of the Member Statesconcerning misleading advertising ( 1). (43) All Member States have adopted further specific measuresconcerning the advertising of medicinal products. There aredisparities between these measures. These disparities are likelyto have an impact on the functioning of the internal market, sinceadvertising disseminated in one Member State is likely to haveeffects in other Member States. (44) Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordi-nation of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation oradministrative action in Member States concerning the pursuitof television broadcasting activities ( 2) prohibits the television advertising of medicinal products which are available only onmedical prescription in the Member State within whose juris-diction the television broadcaster is located. This principleshould be made of general application by extending it to othermedia. (45) Advertising to the general public, even of non-prescriptionmedicinal products, could affect public health, were it to beexcessive and ill-considered. Advertising of medicinal productsto the general public, where it is permitted, ought therefore tosatisfy certain essential criteria which ought to be defined. (46) Furthermore, distribution of samples free of charge to the generalpublic for promotional ends must be prohibited. (47) The advertising of medicinal products to persons qualified toprescribe or supply them contributes to the informationavailable to such persons. Nevertheless, this advertising shouldbe subject to strict conditions and effective monitoring, referringin particular to the work carried out within the framework of the Council of Europe. B2001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u20147 (1) OJ L 250, 19.9.1984, p. 17. Directive as amended by Directive 97/55/EC (OJ L 290, 23.10.1997, p. 18). (2) OJ L 298, 17.10.1989, p. 23. Directive as amended by Directive 97/36/EC (OJ L 202, 30.7.1997, p. 60).(48) Advertising of medicinal products should be subject to effective, adequate monitoring. Reference in this regard should be made tothe monitoring mechanisms set up by Directive 84/450/EEC. (49) Medical sales representatives have an important role in thepromotion of medicinal products. Therefore, certain obligationsshould be imposed upon them, in particular the obligation tosupply the person visited with a summary of product character-istics. (50) Persons qualified to prescribe medicinal products must be able tocarry out these functions objectively without being influenced bydirect or indirect financial inducements. (51) It should be possible within certain restrictive conditions toprovide samples of medicinal products free of charge topersons qualified to prescribe or supply them so that they canfamiliarize themselves with new products and acquire experiencein dealing with them. (52) Persons qualified to prescribe or supply medicinal products musthave access to a neutral, objective source of information aboutproducts available on the market. Whereas it is nevertheless forthe Member States to take all measures necessary to this end, inthe light of their own particular situation. (53) Each undertaking which manufactures or imports medicinalproducts should set up a mechanism to ensure that all informationsupplied about a medicinal product conforms with the approvedconditions of use. (54) In order to ensure the continued safety of medicinal products inuse, it is necessary to ensure that pharmacovigilance systems in the Community are continually adapted to take account of scientific and technical progress. (55) It is necessary to take account of changes arising as a result ofinternational harmonisation of definitions, terminology and tech-nological developments in the field of pharmacovigilance. (56) The increasing use of electronic networks for communication ofinformation on adverse reactions to medicinal products marketed in the Community is intended to allow competent authorities to share the information at the same time. (57) It is the interest of the Community to ensure that the pharmacov-igilance systems for centrally authorised medicinal products andthose authorised by other procedures are consistent. (58) Holders of marketing authorisations should be proactively responsible for on-going pharmacovigilance of the medicinal products they place on the market. (59) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directiveshould be adopted in accordance with Council Decision1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures forthe exercise of implementing powers conferred on theCommission ( 1). (60) The Commission should be empowered to adopt any necessarychanges to Annex I in order to take into account scientific andtechnical progress. (61) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations ofthe Member States concerning the time-limits for transposition ofthe Directives set out in Annex II, Part B.

In establishing the testing program, the following shall be taken into consideration: all tests requiring repeated administration of the product shall be designed to take account of the possible induction of, and inter- ference by, antibodies; examination of reproductive function, of embryo/foetal and peri- natal toxicity, of mutagenic potential and of carcinogenicpotential shall be considered. Where constituents other than the active substance(s) are incriminated, validation of their removal may replace the study. (3) The toxicology and pharmaco-kinetics of an excipient used for the first time in the pharmaceutical field shall be investigated. (4) Where there is a possibility of significant degradation during storage of the medicinal product, the toxicology of degradation products must be considered. 4.2.1. Pharmacology Pharmacology study shall follow two distinct lines of approach. \u2014Firstly, the actions relating to the proposed therapeutic use shall be adequately investigated and described. Where possible, recognised and validated assays, both in vivo and in vitro, shall be used. Novel experimental techniques must be described in such detail as toallow them to be reproduced. The results shall be expressed inquantitative terms using, for example, dose-effect curves, time- effect curves, etc. Wherever possible, comparisons shall be made with data relating to a substance or substances with a similar ther-apeutic action. \u2014Secondly, the applicant shall investigate the potential undesirable pharmaco-dynamic effects of the substance on physiological functions. These investigations shall be performed at exposures inthe anticipated therapeutic range and above. The experimental tech-niques, unless they are standard procedures, must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced, and the investigator must establish their validity. Any suspected modification ofresponses resulting from repeated administration of the substanceshall be investigated. For the pharmaco-dynamic medicinal product interaction, tests on combinations of active substances may be prompted either by pharma- cological premises or by indications of therapeutic effect. In the firstM22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u201490case, the pharmaco-dynamic study shall demonstrate those interactions, which might make the combination of value in therapeutic use. In the second case, where scientific justification for the combination is soughtthrough therapeutic experimentation, the investigation shall determinewhether the effects expected from the combination can be demonstrated in animals, and the importance of any collateral effects shall at least be investigated. 4.2.2. Pharmaco-kinetics Pharmaco-kinetics means the study of the fate of the active substance, and its metabolites, within the organism, and covers the study of theabsorption, distribution, metabolism (bio-transformation) and excretion of these substances. The study of these different phases may be carried mainly by means of physical, chemical or possibly by biological methods, and by obser-vation of the actual pharmaco-dynamic activity of the substance itself. Information on distribution and elimination shall be necessary in all cases where such data are indispensable to determine the dosage for humans, and in respect of chemo-therapeutic substances (antibiotics, etc.) and substances whose use depends on their non-pharmaco-dynamic effects (e.g. numerous diagnostic agents, etc.). In vitro studies also can be carried out with the advantage of using human material for comparison with animal material (i.e. protein binding, metabolism, drug-drug interaction). Pharmaco-kinetic investigation of all pharmacologically active substances is necessary. In the case of new combinations of known substances, which have been investigated in accordance with theprovisions of this Directive, pharmaco-kinetic studies may not berequired, if the toxicity tests and therapeutic experimentation justify their omission. The pharmaco-kinetic program shall be design to allow comparison and extrapolation between animal and human. 4.2.3. Toxicology a) Single-dose toxicity A single-dose toxicity test shall mean a qualitative and quantitative study of the toxic reactions, which may result from a single admin-istration of the active substance or substances contained in the medicinal product, in the proportions and physico-chemical state in which they are present in the actual product. The single-dose toxicity test must be carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines published by the Agency. b) Repeat-dose toxicity Repeated dose toxicity tests are intended to reveal any physiological and/or anatomo-pathological changes induced by repeated adminis- tration of the active substance or combination of active substances under examination, and to determine how these changes are relatedto dosage. Generally, it is desirable that two tests be performed: one short term, lasting two to four weeks, the other long-term. The duration of the latter shall depend on the conditions of clinical use. Its purpose is to describe potential adverse effects to which attentionshould be paid in clinical studies. The duration is defined in therelevant guidelines published by the Agency. c) Geno-toxicity The purposes of the study of mutagenic and clastogenic potential is to reveal the changes which a substance may cause in the genetic material of individuals or cells. Mutagenic substances may present a hazard to health since exposure to a mutagen carries the risk ofinducing germ-line mutation, with the possibility of inherited disorders, and the risk of somatic mutations including those leading to cancer. These studies are obligatory for any newsubstance. d) Carcino-genicityM22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u201491Tests to reveal carcinogenic effects shall normally be required: 1. These studies shall be performed for any medicinal product whose expected clinical use is for a prolonged period of a patient's life, either continuously or repeatedly in an intermittentmanner. 2. These studies are recommended for some medicinal products if there is concern about their carcinogenic potential, e.g. from product of the same class or similar structure, or fromevidence in repeated dose toxicity studies. 3. Studies with unequivocally geno-toxic compounds are not needed, as they are presumed to be trans-species carcinogens, implying a hazard to humans. If such a medicinal product isintended to be administered chronically to humans a chronicstudy may be necessary to detect early tumorigenic effects. e) Reproductive and developmental toxicity Investigation of possible impairment of male or female reproductive function as well as harmful effects on progeny shall be performedby appropriate tests. These tests comprise studies of effect on adult male or female reproductive function, studies of the toxic and teratogenic effectsat all stages of development from conception to sexual maturity aswell as latent effects, when the medicinal product under investi- gation has been administered to the female during pregnancy. Omission of these tests must be adequately justified.Depending on the indicated use of the medicinal product, additional studies addressing development when administering the medicinal product of the offspring may be warranted. Embryo/foetal toxicity studies shall normally be conducted on two mammalian species, one of which shall be other than a rodent. Peri-and postnatal studies shall be conducted in at least one species. If the metabolism of a medicinal product in particular species is known to be similar to that in man, it is desirable to include thisspecies. It is also desirable that one of the species is the same as inthe repeated dose toxicity studies. The state of scientific knowledge at the time when the application is lodged shall be taken into account when determining the studydesign. f) Local tolerance The purpose of local tolerance studies is to ascertain whether medicinal products (both active substances and excipients) aretolerated at sites in the body, which may come into contact withthe medicinal product as a result of its administration in clinical use. The testing strategy shall be such that any mechanical effects of administration or purely physico-chemical actions of the product canbe distinguished from toxicological or pharmaco-dynamic ones. Local tolerance testing shall be conducted with the preparation being developed for human use, using the vehicle and/or excipients in treating the control group(s). Positive controls/referencesubstances shall be included where necessary. The design of local tolerance tests (choice of species, duration, frequency and route of administration, doses) will depend upon the problem to be investigated and the proposed conditions ofadministration in clinical use. Reversibility of local lesions shallbe performed where relevant. Studies in animals can be substituted by validated in vitro tests provided that the test results are of comparable quality andusefulness for the purpose of safety evaluation. For chemicals applied to the skin (e.g. dermal, rectal, vaginal) the sensitising potential shall be evaluated in at least one of the test systems currently available (the guinea pig assay or the local lymph node assay).M22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u2014925.

Content: basic principles and requirements Special attention shall be paid to the following selected elements. a) The clinical particulars to be provided pursuant to Articles 8 (3) (i) and 10 (1) must enable a sufficiently well-founded and scientificallyvalid opinion to be formed as to whether the medicinal product satisfies the criteria governing the granting of a marketing author- isation. Consequently, an essential requirement is that the results ofall clinical trials should be communicated, both favourable and unfavourable. b) Clinical trials must always be preceded by adequate pharmaco- logical and toxicological tests, carried out on animals in accordanceM22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u201493with the requirements of Module 4 of this Annex. The investigator must acquaint himself with the conclusions drawn from the phar- macological and toxicological studies and hence the applicant mustprovide him at least with the investigator's brochure, consisting ofall the relevant information known prior to the onset of a clinical trial including chemical, pharmaceutical and biological data, toxi- cological, pharmaco-kinetic and pharmaco-dynamic data in animalsand the results of earlier clinical trials, with adequate data to justifythe nature, scale and duration of the proposed trial; the complete pharmacological and toxicological reports shall be provided on request. For materials of human or animal origin, all availablemeans shall be employed to ensure safety from transmission ofinfectious agents prior to the commencement of the trial. c) Marketing authorisation holders must arrange for essential clinical trial documents (including case report forms) other than subject'smedical files, to be kept by the owners of the data: \u2014for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the trial, \u2014or for at least two years after the granting of the last marketing authorisation in the European Community and when there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in theEuropean Community, \u2014or for at least two years after formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. Subject's medical files should be retained in accordance with applicable legislation and in accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution or privatepractice. The documents can be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or byagreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsorto inform the hospital, institution or practice as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. The sponsor or other owner of the data shall retain all other docu- mentation pertaining to the trial as long as the product is authorised. This documentation shall include: the protocol including the rationale, objectives and statistical design and methodology of thetrial, with conditions under which it is performed and managed, anddetails of the investigational product, the reference medicinal product and/or the placebo used; standard operating procedures; all written opinions on the protocol and procedures; the investi-gator's brochure; case report forms on each trial subject; finalreport; audit certificate(s), if available. The final report shall be retained by the sponsor or subsequent owner, for five years after the medicinal product is no longer authorised. In addition for trials conducted within the European Community, the marketing authorisation holder shall make any additional arrangements for archiving of documentation in accordance withthe provisions of Directive 2001/20/EC and implementing detailedguidelines. Any change of ownership of the data shall be documented. All data and documents shall be made available if requested by relevant authorities. d) The particulars of each clinical trial must contain sufficient detail to allow an objective judgement to be made: \u2014the protocol, including the rationale, objectives and statistical design and methodology of the trial, with conditions underwhich it is performed and managed, and details of the investi- gational medicinal product used \u2014audit certificate(s), if available \u2014the list of investigator(s), and each investigator shall give his name, address, appointments, qualifications and clinical duties, state where the trial was carried out and assemble the infor-M22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u201494mation in respect of each patient individually, including case report forms on each trial subject \u2014final report signed by the investigator and for multi-centre trials, by all the investigators or the co-ordinating (principal) inves- tigator. e) The particulars of clinical trials referred to above shall be forwarded to the competent authorities. However, in agreement with thecompetent authorities, the applicant may omit part of this infor- mation. Complete documentation shall be provided forthwith upon request. The investigator shall, in his conclusions on the experimental evidence, express an opinion on the safety of the product undernormal conditions of use, its tolerance, its efficacy and any useful information relating to indications and contra-indications, dosage and average duration of treatment as well as any special precautionsto be taken during treatment and the clinical symptoms of overdosage. In reporting the results of a multi-centre study, the principal investigator shall, in his conclusions, express an opinion on the safety and efficacy of the investigational medicinal producton behalf of all centres. f) The clinical observations shall be summarised for each trial indi- cating: 1) the number and sex of subjects treated;2) the selection and age-distribution of the groups of patients being investigated and the comparative tests; 3) the number of patients withdrawn prematurely from the trials and the reasons for such withdrawal; 4) where controlled trials were carried out under the above conditions, whether the control group: \u2014received no treatment \u2014received a placebo \u2014received another medicinal product of known effect \u2014received treatment other than therapy using medicinal products 5) the frequency of observed adverse reactions; 6) details concerning patients who may be at increased risk, e.g. elderly people, children, women during pregnancy or menstruation, or whose physiological or pathological conditionrequires special consideration; 7) parameters or evaluation criteria of efficacy and the results in terms of these parameters; 8) a statistical evaluation of the results when this is called for by the design of the trials and the variable factors involved. g) In addition, the investigator shall always indicate his observations on: 1) any signs of habituation, addiction or difficulty in weaning patients from the medicinal product; 2) any interactions that have been observed with other medicinal products administered concomitantly; 3) the criteria determining exclusion of certain patients from the trials; 4) any deaths which occurred during the trial or within the follow- up period. h) Particulars concerning a new combination of medicinal substances must be identical to those required for new medicinal products and must substantiate the safety and efficacy of the combination. i) Total or partial omission of data must be explained. Should unex- pected results occur during the course of the trials, further preM22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u201495clinical toxicological and pharmacological tests must be undertaken and reviewed. j) If the medicinal product is intended for long-term administration, particulars shall be given of any modification of the pharmaco-logical action following repeated administration, as well as the establishment of long-term dosage. 5.2.1. Reports of bio-pharmaceutics studies Bio-availability study reports, comparative bio-availability, bio- equivalence study reports, reports on in vitro and in vivo correlation study, and bio-analytical and analytical methods shall be provided. In addition, an assessment of bio-availability shall be undertaken where necessary to demonstrate bio-equivalence for the medicinal products referred to in Article 10 (1) (a). 5.2.2. Reports of studies pertinent to pharmaco-kinetics using human bio- materials For the purposes of this Annex, human bio-materials shall mean any proteins, cells, tissues and related materials derived from humansources that are used in vitro or ex vivo to assess pharmaco-kineticsproperties of drug substances. In this respect, reports of plasma protein binding study, hepatic meta- bolism and active substance interaction studies and studies using otherhuman bio-materials shall be provided. 5.2.3. Reports of human pharmaco-kinetic studies a) The following pharmaco-kinetic characteristics shall be described: \u2014absorption (rate and extent), \u2014distribution, \u2014metabolism, \u2014excretion. Clinically significant features including the implication of the kinetic data for the dosage regimen especially for patients at risk, and differences between man and animal species used in the pre clinical studies, shall be described. In addition to standard multiple-sample pharmaco-kinetics studies, population pharmaco-kinetics analyses based on sparse sampling during clinical studies can also address questions about the contri- butions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the variability in thedose- pharmaco-kinetics response relationship. Reports ofpharmaco-kinetic and initial tolerability studies in healthy subjects and in patients, reports of pharmaco-kinetic studies to assess effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and reports of populationpharmaco-kinetic studies shall be provided. b) If the medicinal product is normally to be administered concomi- tantly with other medicinal products, particulars shall be given ofjoint administration tests performed to demonstrate possible modi-fication of the pharmacological action. Pharmaco-kinetic interactions between the active substance and other medicinal products or substances shall be investigated. 5.2.4. Reports of human pharmaco-dynamic studies a) The pharmaco-dynamic action correlated to the efficacy shall be demonstrated including: \u2014the dose-response relationship and its time course, \u2014justification for the dosage and conditions of administration, \u2014the mode of action, if possible. The pharmaco-dynamic action not related to efficacy shall be described.M22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u201496The demonstration of pharmaco-dynamic effects in human beings shall not in itself be sufficient to justify conclusions regarding any particular potential therapeutic effect. b) If the medicinal product is normally to be administered concomi- tantly with other medicinal products, particulars shall be given ofjoint administration tests performed to demonstrate possible modi-fication of the pharmacological action. Pharmaco-dynamic interactions between the active substance and other medicinal products or substances shall be investigated. 5.2.5. Reports of efficacy and safety studies 5.2.5.1. S t u d y R e p o r t s o f C o n t r o l l e d C l i n i c a l S t u d i e s Pertinent to the Claimed Indication In general, clinical trials shall be done as 'controlled clinical trials 'if possible, randomised and as appropriate versus placebo and versus anestablished medicinal product of proven therapeutic value; any other design shall be justified. The treatment of the control groups will vary from case to case and also will depend on ethical considerations andtherapeutic area; thus it may, in some instances, be more pertinent tocompare the efficacy of a new medicinal product with that of an established medicinal product of proven therapeutic value rather than with the effect of a placebo. (1) As far as possible, and particularly in trials where the effect of the product cannot be objectively measured, steps shall be taken toavoid bias, including methods of randomisation and blinding. (2) The protocol of the trial must include a thorough description of the statistical methods to be employed, the number and reasons for inclusion of patients (including calculations of the power of the trial), the level of significance to be used and a description ofthe statistical unit. Measures taken to avoid bias, particularlymethods of randomisation, shall be documented. Inclusion of a large number of subjects in a trial must not be regarded as an adequate substitute for a properly controlled trial. The safety data shall be reviewed taking into account guidelines published by the Commission, with particular attention to eventsresulting in changes of dose or need for concomitant medication, serious adverse events, events resulting in withdrawal, and deaths. Any patients or patient groups at increased risk shall be identifiedand particular attention paid to potentially vulnerable patients whomay be present in small numbers, e.g., children, pregnant women, frail elderly, people with marked abnormalities of metabolism or excretion etc. The implication of the safety evaluation for thepossible uses of the medicinal product shall be described. 5.2.5.2. S t u d y r e p o r t s o f u n c o n t r o l l e d c l i n i c a l s t u d i e s reports of analyses of data from more than one study and other clinical study reports These reports shall be provided. 5.2.6. Reports of post-marketing experience If the medicinal product is already authorised in third countries, infor- mation shall be given in respect of adverse reactions of the medicinalproduct concerned and medicinal products containing the same activesubstance(s), in relation to the usage rates if possible. 5.2.7. Case reports forms and individual patient listings When submitted in accordance with the relevant Guideline published by the Agency, case report forms and individual patient data listings shall be provided and presented in the same order as the clinical studyreports and indexed by study. PART II SPECIFIC MARKETING AUTHORISATION DOSSIERS AND REQUIREMENTS Some medicinal products present specific features which are such that all the requirements of the marketing authorisation application dossier as laid down in Part I of this Annex need to be adapted. To take account of these particularM22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u201497situations, an appropriate and adapted presentation of the dossier shall be followed by applicants. 1. WELL-ESTABLISHED MEDICINAL USE For medicinal products the active substance(s) of which has/have a 'well-established medicinal use 'as referred to Article 10(1)(a)(ii), with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety, the following specific rules shall apply. The applicant shall submit Modules 1, 2 and 3 as described in part I of this Annex. For Modules 4 and 5, a detailed scientific bibliography shall address non-clinical and clinical characteristics. The following specific rules shall apply in order to demonstrate the well-established medicinal use: a) Factors which have to be taken into account in order to establish a well-established medicinal use of constituents of medicinal products are: \u2014the time over which a substance has been used, \u2014quantitative aspects of the use of the substance, \u2014the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (reflected in the published scientific literature) and \u2014the coherence of scientific assessments. Therefore different periods of time may be necessary for estab- lishing well-established use of different substances. In any case, however, the period of time required for establishing a well estab-lished medicinal use of a constituent of a medicinal product mustnot be less than one decade from the first systematic and docu- mented use of that substance as a medicinal product in the Community. b) The documentation submitted by the applicant should cover all aspects of the safety and/or efficacy assessment and must include or refer to a review of the relevant literature, taking into account pre- and post-marketing studies and published scientific literatureconcerning experience in the form of epidemiological studies andin particular of comparative epidemiological studies. All documen- tation, both favourable and unfavourable, must be communicated. With respect to the provisions on 'well-established medicinal use ' it is in particular necessary to clarify that 'bibliographic reference ' to other sources of evidence (post marketing studies, epidemio- logical studies, etc.) and not just data related to tests and trials may serve as a valid proof of safety and efficacy of a product ifan application explains and justifies the use of these sources ofinformation satisfactorily. c) Particular attention must be paid to any missing information and justification must be given why demonstration of an acceptablelevel of safety and/or efficacy can be supported although somestudies are lacking. d) The non-clinical and/or clinical overviews must explain the relevance of any data submitted which concern a productdifferent from the product intended for marketing. A judgementmust be made whether the product studied can be considered as similar to the product, for which application for a marketing authorisation has been made in spite of the existing differences. e) Post-marketing experience with other products containing the same constituents is of particular importance and applicants should put a special emphasis on this issue. 2. ESSENTIALLY SIMILAR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS a) Applications based upon Article 10(1) (a) (i) (essentially similar products) shall contain the data described in Modules 1, 2 and 3of Part I of this Annex provided the applicant has been granted the consent of the holder of the original marketing authorisation to cross refer to the content of his Modules 4 and 5.M22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u201498b) Applications based upon Article 10(1) (a) (iii) (essentially similar products i.e. generics) shall contain the data described in Modules 1, 2 and 3 of Part I of this Annex together with data showing bio-availability and bio-equivalence with the original medicinal productprovided the latter is not a biological medicinal product (see Part II, 4 Similar biological medicinal products). For these products the non-clinical/clinical overviews/summaries shall particularly focus on the following elements: \u2014the grounds for claiming essential similarity; \u2014a summary of impurities present in batches of the active substance(s) as well as those of the finished medicinal product (and where relevant decomposition products arising duringstorage) as proposed for use in the product to be marketedtogether with an evaluation of these impurities; \u2014an evaluation of the bio-equivalence studies or a justification why studies were not performed with respect to the guideline on 'Inves- tigation of Bio-availability and Bio-equivalence '; \u2014an update of published literature relevant to the substance and the present application. It may be acceptable for articles in 'peer review 'journals to be annotated for this purpose; \u2014every claim in the summary of product characteristics not known from or inferred from the properties of the medicinal product and/or its therapeutic group should be discussed in the non clinical/clinical overviews/summaries and substantiated by published literatureand/or additional studies. \u2014if applicable, additional data in order to demonstrate evidence on the equivalence of safety and efficacy properties of different salts, esters or derivatives of an authorised active substance should be provided by the applicant when he claims essential similarity. 3. ADDITIONAL DATA REQUIRED IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS Where the active substance of an essentially similar medicinal product contains the same therapeutic moiety as the original authorised product associated with a different salt/ester complex/derivative evidence thatthere is no change in the pharmaco-kinetics of the moiety, pharmaco-dynamics and/or in toxicity which could change the safety/efficacy profile shall be demonstrated. Should this not be the case, this associ- ation shall be considered as a new active substance. Where a medicinal product is intended for a different therapeutic use or presented in a different pharmaceutical form or to be administered bydifferent routes or in different doses or with a different posology, the results of appropriate toxicological and pharmacological tests and/or of clinical trials shall be provided. 4. SIMILAR BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS The provisions of Article 10(1)(a) (iii) may not be sufficient in the case of biological medicinal products. If the information required in the case of essentially similar products (generics) does not permit the demon-stration of the similar nature of two biological medicinal products,additional data, in particular, the toxicological and clinical profile shall be provided. When a biological medicinal product as defined in Part I, paragraph 3.2 of this Annex, which refers to an original medicinal product havingbeen granted a marketing authorisation in the Community, is submitted for a marketing authorisation by an independent applicant after the expiry of data protection period, the following approach shall beapplied. \u2014Information to be supplied shall not be limited to Modules 1, 2 and 3 (pharmaceutical, chemical and biological data), supplemented with bio-equivalence and bio-availability data. The type and amount of additional data (i.e. toxicological and other non-clinical andappropriate clinical data) shall be determined on a case by case basis in accordance with relevant scientific guidelines. \u2014Due to the diversity of biological medicinal products, the need for identified studies foreseen in Modules 4 and 5, shall be required byM22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u201499the competent authority, taking into account the specific charac- teristic of each individual medicinal product. The general principles to be applied are addressed in a guideline taking into account the characteristics of the concerned biological medicinal product published by the Agency. In case the originally authorisedmedicinal product has more than one indication, the efficacy andsafety of the medicinal product claimed to be similar has to be justified or, if necessary, demonstrated separately for each of the claimed indications. 5. FIXED COMBINATION MEDICINAL PRODUCTS Applications based upon Article 10 (1) (b) shall relate to new medicinal products made of at least two active substances not previouslyauthorised as a fixed combination medicinal product. For those applications a full dossier (Modules 1 to 5) shall be provided for the fixed combination medicinal product. Where applicable, infor- mation regarding the manufacturing sites and the adventitious agents, safety evaluation shall be provided. 6. DOCUMENTATION FOR APPLICATIONS IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES When, as provided for in Article 22, the applicant can show that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety undernormal conditions of use, because: \u2014the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or \u2014in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive infor- mation cannot be provided, or \u2014it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information, marketing authorisation may be granted subject to certain specific obli- gations. These obligations may include the following: \u2014the applicant shall complete an identified programme of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which shall form the basis of a reassessment of thebenefit/risk profile, \u2014the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radio-pharmaceutical, by an authorised person, \u2014the package leaflet and any medical information shall draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particularsavailable concerning the medicinal product in question are as yetinadequate in certain specified respects. 7. MIXED MARKETING AUTHORISATION APPLICATIONS Mixed marketing-authorisation applications shall mean marketing- authorisation application dossiers where Module 4 and/or 5 consists of a combination of reports of limited non-clinical and/or clinical studies carried out by the applicant and of bibliographical references.All other Module(s) are in accordance with the structure described inPart I of this Annex. The competent authority shall accept the proposed format presented by the applicant on a case by case basis. PART III PARTICULAR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS This Part lays down specific requirements related to the nature of identified medicinal products.M22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u20141001. BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 1.1.

The vector can also be included in a human or animal cell. 1.1. Diversity of gene therapy medicinal products a) Gene therapy medicinal products based on allogeneic or xeno- geneic cells The vector is ready-prepared and stored before its transfer into the host cells. The cells have been obtained previously and may be processed as a cell bank (bank collection or bank established from procurement ofprimary cells) with a limited viability. The cells genetically modified by the vector represent an active substance. Additional steps may be carried out in order to obtain the finished product. By essence, such a medicinal product is intended to beadministered to a certain number of patients. b) Gene therapy medicinal products using autologous human cells The active substance is a batch of ready-prepared vector stored before its transfer into the autologous cells. Additional steps may be carried out in order to obtain the finished medicinal product. Those products are prepared from cells obtained from an individual patient. The cells are then genetically modified using a ready- prepared vector containing the appropriate gene that has been prepared in advance and that constitutes the active substance.The preparation is re-injected into the patient and is by definition intended to a single patient. The whole manufacturing process from the collection of the cells from the patient up to the re-injection tothe patient shall be considered as one intervention. c) Administration of ready-prepared vectors with inserted (prophy- lactic, diagnostic or therapeutic) genetic material The active substance is a batch of ready-prepared vector. Additional steps may be carried out in order to obtain the finished medicinal product. This type of medicinal product is intended to beadministered to several patients. Transfer of genetic material may be carried out by direct injection of the ready-prepared vector to the recipients. 1.2.

E.g., the presenceof replication competent virus in stocks of non-replicationcompetent viral vectors must be excluded. 2. SOMATIC CELL THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS (HUMAN AND XENOGENEIC) For the purposes of this Annex, somatic cell therapy medicinal products shall mean the use in humans of autologous (emanating from the patient himself), allogeneic (coming from another human being) or xenogeneic (coming from animals) somatic living cells, thebiological characteristics of which have been substantially altered as aresult of their manipulation to obtain a therapeutic, diagnostic or preventive effect through metabolic, pharmacological and immuno- logical means. This manipulation includes the expansion or activationof autologous cell populations ex vivo (e.g., adoptive immuno-therapy),the use of allogeneic and xenogeneic cells associated with medical devices used ex vivo or in vivo (e.g., not).M22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u2014110Specific requirements for cell therapy medicinal products regarding Module 3 Somatic cell therapy medicinal products include: \u2014Cells manipulated to modify their immunological, metabolic or other functional properties in qualitative or quantitative aspects; \u2014Cells sorted, selected and manipulated and subsequently undergoing a manufacturing process in order to obtain the finished medicinal product; \u2014Cells manipulated and combined with non-cellular components (e.g. biological or inert matrixes or medical devices) and exerting the principle intended action in the finished product; \u2014Autologous cell derivatives expressed in vitro under specific culture conditions; \u2014Cells genetically modified or otherwise manipulated to express previously unexpressed homologous or non-homologous functional properties. The whole manufacturing process from the collection of the cells from the patient (autologous situation) up to the re-injection to the patient shall be considered as one single intervention. As for other medicinal products, the three elements of the manufac- turing process are identified: \u2014starting materials: materials from which the active substance is manufactured, i.e., organs, tissues, body fluids or cells; \u2014active substance: manipulated cells, cell lysates, proliferating cells and cells used in conjunction with inert matrixes and medical devices; \u2014finished medicinal products: active substance formulated in its final immediate container for the intended medical use. a) General information on active substance(s) The active substances of cell therapy medicinal products consist of cells which as a consequence of in vitro processing displayprophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic properties different fromthe original physiological and biological one.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR GENE THERAPY AND SOMATIC CELL THERAPY (HUMAN AND XENOGENEIC)MEDICINAL PRODUCTS REGARDING MODULES 4 AND 5 3.1. Module 4 For gene and somatic cell therapy medicinal products, it is recognised that conventional requirements as laid down in Module 4 for non- clinical testing of medicinal products may not always be appropriateM22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u2014112due to unique and diverse structural and biological properties of the products in question, including high degree of species specificity, subject specificity, immunological barriers and differences in pleio-tropic responses. The rationale underpinning the non-clinical development and the criteria used to choose relevant species and models shall be properly captioned in Module 2. It may be necessary to identify or develop new animal models in order to assist in the extrapolation of specific findings on functional endpoints and toxicity to in vivo activity of the products in humanbeings. The scientific justification for the use of these animal modelsof disease to support safety and proof of concept for efficacy shall be provided. 3.2. Module 5 The efficacy of advanced therapy medicinal products must be demon- strated as described in Module 5. For some products and for some therapeutic indications, however, it may not be possible to performconventional clinical trials. Any deviation from the existing guidelinesshall be justified in Module 2. The clinical development of advanced therapy medicinal products will have some special features owing to the complex and labile nature ofthe active substances. It requires additional considerations because of issues related to viability, proliferation, migration and differentiation of cells (somatic cell therapy), because of the special clinical circum-stances where the products are used or because of the special modeof action through gene expression (somatic gene therapy). Special risks associated with such products arising from potential con- tamination with infectious agents must be addressed in the applicationfor marketing authorisation for advanced therapy medicinal products.Special emphasis should be put on both the early stages of devel- opment in one hand, including the choice of donors in the case of cell therapy medicinal products, and on the therapeutic interventionas a whole, including the proper handling and administration of the product on the other hand. Furthermore, Module 5 of the application should contain, as relevant, data on the measures to surveying and control of the functions anddevelopment of living cells in the recipient, to prevent transmission of infectious agents to the recipient and to minimise any potential risks to public health. 3.2.1. Human pharmacology and efficacy studies Human pharmacology studies should provide information on the expected mode of action, expected efficacy based on justified end-points, bio-distribution, adequate dose, schedule, and methods ofadministration or modality of use desirable for efficacy studies. Conventional pharmaco-kinetic studies may not be relevant for some advanced therapy products. Sometimes studies in healthy volunteers arenot feasible and the establishment of dose and kinetics will be difficult to determine in clinical trials. It is necessary, however, to study the distribution and in vivo behaviour of the product including cell prolif-eration and long-term function as well as the extent, distribution of thegene product and duration of the desired gene expression. Appropriate tests shall be used and, if necessary, developed for the tracing of the cell product or cell expressing the desired gene in the human body andfor the monitoring of the function of the cells that were administered ortransfected. The assessment of the efficacy and safety of an advanced therapy medicinal product must include the careful description and evaluationof the therapeutic procedure as a whole, including special ways of administration, (such as transfection of cells ex vivo, in vitro manip- ulation, or use of interventional techniques), and testing of the possibleassociated regimens (including immuno-suppressive, antiviral, cytotoxictreatment). The whole procedure must be tested in clinical trials and described in the product information.M22001L0083 \u2014EN\u201426.01.2007 \u2014004.001 \u20141133.2.2. Safety Safety issues arising from immune response to the medicinal products or to the expressed proteins, immune rejection, immuno-suppression, and breakdown of immuno-isolation devices shall be considered. Certain advanced gene therapy and somatic cell therapy medicinal products (e.g. xenogeneic cell therapy and certain gene transferproducts) may contain replication-competent particles and/or infectious agents. The patient may have to be monitored for the development of possible infections and/or their pathological sequelae during pre- and/orpost-authorisation phases; this surveillance may have to be extended toclose contacts of the patient including health-care workers. The risk of contamination with potentially transmissible agents cannot be totally eliminated in the use of certain somatic cell therapymedicinal products and certain gene transfer medicinal products. Therisk can be minimised, however, by appropriate measures as described in Module 3. The measures included in the production process must be comple- mented with accompanied testing methods, quality control processesand by appropriate surveillance methods that must be described inModule 5. The use of certain advanced somatic cell therapy medicinal products may have to be limited, temporarily or permanently, to establishmentsthat have documented expertise and facilities for assuring a specificfollow up of the safety of the patients. A similar approach may be relevant for certain gene therapy medicinal products that are associated with a potential risk of replication-competent infectious agents. The long term monitoring aspects for the development of late compli- cations shall also be considered and addressed in the submission, whererelevant. Where appropriate, the applicant has to submit a detailed risk management plan covering clinical and laboratory data of the patient, emerging epidemiological data, and, if relevant, data from archives oftissue samples from the donor and the recipient. Such a system is needed to ensure the traceability of the medicinal product and the rapid response to suspicious patterns of adverse events. 4. SPECIFIC STATEMENT ON XENO-TRANSPLANTATION MEDICINAL PRODUCTS For the purposes of this Annex, xeno-transplantation shall mean any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation, or infusion into a human recipient of either live tissues or organs retrieved from animals, or, human body fluids, cells, tissues or organs that haveundergone ex vivo contact with live non-human animal cells, tissuesor organs. Specific emphasis shall be paid to the starting materials.
