Introduction Cancer is a complex chronic disease and cancer development is a multistep process ( [1, 2](javascript:;)). In a simplified manner, it would involve initiation, promotion, to progression/metastasis ( [3, 4](javascript:;)). Recent evidence suggests that many chronic illnesses including cancer are driven by epigenetics/epigenomics caused by environmental factors impinging upon the underlying genetic information ( [4-7](javascript:;)). Because advanced metastasized cancer are resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic drugs, prevention of early stages of cancer by relatively nontoxic dietary phytochemicals would be logical. Role of Epigenetics/Epigenomics during the \"Long Process\" of Cancer Development During the long process of cancer development particularly during the \"promotion\" stage, epigenetics has been postulated to play an important role in driving cellular transformation such as stem cells in forming benign microscopic tumor ( [8](javascript:;)). Feinberg and colleagues has shown since the 1980s that most if not all tumors could be associated with widespread losses and some gains of DNA methylation throughout the genome ( [9, 10](javascript:;)). This is reviewed recently in refs. [6](javascript:;) and [11](javascript:;), and elaborated on the role of epigenetics during cancer development However, it is still unclear how epigenetics would be integrated with the different hallmarks of cancer as discussed by Weinberg and colleagues ( [12](javascript:;)). Epigenetics or in a more global context epigenomics is a very complex process involving modulation of epigenetic modifiers including the \"readers,\" \"writers,\" and \"erasers\" events including methylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination ( [13](javascript:;)). Accumulating evidence also suggests that multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations would occur concurrently during tumor development ( [6, 14](javascript:;)). In this context, the epigenetic marks (DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and ncRNA) could be use as potential markers of different stages of cancer development including initiation, progression, and metastasis ( [15, 16](javascript:;)). From our recent UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis study, global CpG methylation changes more dramatically in early stages of 2 weeks as compared with 15 weeks and 25 weeks post UVB irradiation. The CpG methylome changes decreased as time progresses taken into account of the effect of aging ( [17](javascript:;)). Imaging-assisted evaluation of microscopic tumors may have suggested that during the early promotion stage of carcinogenesis, drastic epigenomic aberrations occurs particularly with the progenitor stem cells driving phenotypic gene expression, may occur before mutational events ( [6](javascript:;)). These epigenomic alterations would involve stem cell dysregulation blocking differentiation, dysregulation of multiple pathways including DNA repair and cell cycle, apoptosis/autophagy, cellular defense, and inflammatory pathways. However, the underlying mechanism of UVB-induced global epigenomic changes in the skin is unclear. Acutely, UVB triggers oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage ( [18, 19](javascript:;)), would be postulated to be some of the major drivers of epigenetic alterations. Analyzing primary cutaneous melanoma samples for their global DNA methylation, found more than 98% loss of methylation and about 2% gain of methylation ( [20](javascript:;)). In vitro study using melanoma cells showed that histone hypoacetylation is associated with downregulation of certain proapoptotic proteins, including Bak, Bim, and Bax, which belong to the BCL-2 family ( [21](javascript:;)). Epigenetic reprogramming appears to play an increasing role in drug resistant in melanoma ( [22](javascript:;)). In skin transformation model using epidermal JB6 cells, when JB6 cells were challenged with tumor promoter TPA (12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), significant alterations of DNA methylome coupled with transcriptome ( [23](javascript:;)). In a recent 60% of the DNA-methylated-regions (DMR) showed inversed relationship between DNA methylation and RNA expression, that is, hypermethylation coupled with suppression of transcription or hypomethylation coupled with promotion of transcription, while the other 40% of these DMRs did not show such relationship ( [23](javascript:;)). In breast cancer, many studies have shown strong association of aberrant DNA hypomethylation with cancer development ( [24](javascript:;)). Histone modifications such as loss of H4K16 acetylation has been implicated as an early event in breast cancer development and is associated with altered level of NAD-dependent histone of zeste homolog 2) appears common in both localized and metastatic prostate cancer, and associated with poor prognosis ( [27, 28](javascript:;)). In early prostate carcinogenesis, during the transition from benign prostate epithelium to inflammatory lesions, DNA hypermethylation is observed in the promoter regions of key tumor suppresser genes such as GSTP1, RASSF1A, and APC ( of Nrf2's CpGs occurred ( [31](javascript:;)), and global alteration of epigenomic DNA methylation was found with profiling using MeDIP-seq in TRAMP prostate tumor ( [32](javascript:;)). In a PTEN deletion mouse prostate carcinogenesis model, PTEN deletion drives aberrations of DNA methylome and transcriptome in different stages of prostate carcinogenesis ( [33](javascript:;)). Prostate cancer exhibited global alterations colleagues ( [35](javascript:;)) investigated the molecular evolution of 292 patients with early-onset prostate cancer using Illumina 450K methylation array identified some unique DNA methylation patterns of 500 most discriminatory CpG sites between the different cell types (basal, stromal, normal luminal, and tumor luminal) and found that the \"purity-adjusted epigenetic prostate cancer index\" associated with increased Gleason score ( [36](javascript:;)). By integrating the DNA methylation and RNA expression data from tumors diagnosed with early onset, they were able to identify four robust subgroups which could stratify the patients into high- and low-risk groups ( [35](javascript:;)). Epigenetics plays an increasing role in colorectal cancer ( [37](javascript:;)). In an Azoxymethane (AOM)/Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis-accelerated colon cancer mouse model, differential CpG methylome and transcriptome occurs as compared with control mice ( [38](javascript:;)). CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), has been identified as one of the molecular features of colorectal cancer ( [39, 40](javascript:;)). On the basis of CIMP profiles, primary colorectal cancer may be clustered into three distinct but relatively homogeneous subclasses: CIMP1, characterized by intense methylation of multiple genes MSI and BRAF mutations; CIMP2, increased methylation with agerelated genes, and mutations in KRAS; and CIMP negative, characterized by rare methylation with p53 mutation ( [39](javascript:;)). CIMP1 and CIMP2 more often expressed in the proximal colon; CIMP1 has a good prognosis, whereas CIMP2 has a poor prognosis ( [41](javascript:;)). In general, CIMP appears to be associated with significantly worse prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer ( [42](javascript:;)). Overview of Epigenetic Mechanisms and Their Role in Cancer Prevention Epigenetic mechanism appears to provide a robust means for organisms to respond to environmental cues through changes in gene expression ( [43](javascript:;)), working in concert with other more rapid responders including channels/receptors mediated signaling. These posttranslational modifications act in a coordinated fashion leading to chromatin conformational alterations that, in turn, regulate the genetic information accessed by transcription factors ( [44](javascript:;)). The schematic representation of epigenetic pathways in process and cancer prevention by isothiocyanates (ITC) impinging upon and integrating with the different cellular processes are summarized in [Fig. 1](javascript:;). Epigenetic machinery would affect all the stages during carcinogenesis. Among the three epigenetic mechanisms, DNA CpG methylation is probably the most studied as reviewed by Feinberg ( [6](javascript:;)). Specifically, DNA methylation entails the conjugation of methyl groups in cytosine (C) residues usually occur in CpG dinucleotide sequences, dispersed across the genome, leading to the formation of 5-methylcytosine (5 mC; ref. [45](javascript:;)). DNA methylation is catalyzed by a class of enzymes known as DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) the most predominate causes gene activation whereas histone methylation can result in either activation or repression of genes depending on the site of modifications ( [46](javascript:;)). HDACs, along with histone acetyltransferases (HAT), provide a significant mechanism of gene regulation involving removal and addition, of acetyl groups from an -N-acetyl lysine amino acid on histone proteins. The third epigenetic control would be regulated through ncRNA-based mechanisms including miRNA. In particular, micro-RNA transcription can be regulated by both histone modification and DNA methylation, and miRNA themselves can, in turn, regulate key enzymes that enforce epigenetic remodeling ( [47](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) Several chemotherapeutic drugs targeting signaling have been approved by the FDA ( [14](javascript:;)), and a growing list of dietary phytochemicals found naturally in food and plants have been studied targeting epigenetic mechanism during the carcinogenesis process for cancer prevention including modifications of histones and DNA methylations ( [48, 49](javascript:;)). For powerful antiinflammatory/antioxidant agent, regulating multiple signaling pathways, is also found to modulate epigenetics/epigenomics pathways such as histones modifications, and DNA methylation ( [50, 51](javascript:;)). Many natural products have been reported to inhibit the expression of HDACs, including K and ursolic acid, have been shown to induce global hypomethylation, enhances hypermethylation/hypomethylation of the promoters of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and modifying miRNA by targeting DNMT1 ( [48](javascript:;)). SFN by downregulating expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3B, thus inducing the demethylation of the cyclin D2 gene promoter and its expression in cancer cells ( [57](javascript:;)). Question remains as to how all these chemopreventive phytochemicals modulate the epigenetic machinery. Because many of these compounds are redox active, therefore, we would like to postulate that redox signaling triggered by these compounds could play a role in modulating the epigenetic machinery, but further study would be needed. Role of Redox Signaling in the Modulation of Epigenetic Machinery Cellular oxidative stress occurs when the cellular antioxidant/reductive capacity is overwhelmed by the oxidative challenges ( [58, 59](javascript:;)), and could play and DNA methylation, may with central metabolism through redox intermediates ( [60](javascript:;)). One mechanism by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) can affect DNA methylation is through its action on DNMTs activity or expression ( [61](javascript:;)). In an oxidizing (SAMe), DNMT3a and DNMT3b can catalyze the direct of 5mC or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) to an unmodified C, although the exact mechanisms are still unclear ( [62](javascript:;)). Ye and colleagues have proposed an iron-redox-methylation hypothesis ( [63](javascript:;)) in which excess amount of irons perturbs DNA methylation by at least two possible mechanisms: first, oxidative stress depletes glutathione (GSH) and drives SAM/SAH cycle to produce more SAH, which inhibits DNMT activity; and second, iron directly inhibits DNMT activity. The methylation process can be reversed by DNA demethylases such as ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TET; ref. [64](javascript:;)). ROS are also thought to regulate DNA methylation by targeting the expression and/or activity of the TETs. Knockdown of TET1 significantly increase cells, and cerebellar granule cells from Tet1 knockout mice are more sensitive to oxidative stress ( [65](javascript:;)). In addition, mutagenic lesion of ROS-induced DNA damage of O6-methylguanine can inhibit binding of DNMT leading to hypomethylation of 5 mC in the methyl-CpG-binding protein (MBP) recognition sequence resulted in significant inhibition of the binding affinity of MBP ( [67](javascript:;)). In addition to epigenetic regulation of histone deacetylation is mediated A study has shown that the redox-regulating protein Thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) regulates the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of class II HDACs through a redox-dependent mechanism ( [68](javascript:;)). By forming a multiprotein complex with DnaJb5, a heatshock protein 40, and TBP-2, a Trx1-binding protein, Trx1 reduces HDAC4, a class II HDAC, at Cys-667 and Cys-669, which are easily oxidized to form a disulfide bond in response to hypertrophic stimuli ( [69](javascript:;)). Hu, and colleagues showed that the catalytic activity of HDAC5 suppresses mitochondrial ROS generation and subsequent gene expression in cardiomyocytes ( [70](javascript:;)). Collectively, there is strong evidence that ROS are capable to modulate chromatin accessibility by affecting histone acetylation state, in particular, via multiple modifications of HDAC expression and activity ( [71, 72](javascript:;)). Histone acetylation is reversible and is a group of HATs ( [73](javascript:;)). Histone methylation is maintained also be subjected to redox regulation such that posttranslational modifications of histone proteins by oxidants and environmental stresses can trigger gene transcription involved in chronic inflammatory events ( [75](javascript:;)). Since many of redox signaling and epigenetics/epigenomics. ITCs and Cancer Prevention ITCs are a family of compounds derived almost exclusively from plants, although marine sponges and fungi also have been reported to produce a few ITCs ( [78, 79](javascript:;)). ITCs are as secondary metabolites in plants including the cruciferous. Glucosinolates are relatively stable in plant cell. However, when the plant tissue containing glucosinolates is damaged, as in the case of preparation (cutting, chopping, mixing) or chewing food, a -thioglucosidase called myrosinase is released and hydrolyzed the glucosinolates metabolites, including the ITCs ( When are cooked before consumption, myrosinase is inactivated and glucosinolates transit to the colon where they are hydrolyzed by the intestinal microbiota to ITCs ( [80](javascript:;)). By far the most is (SFN), derived from broccoli (BITC), and allyl ITC, also possess chemopreventive properties. Multiple molecular mechanisms are involved in the chemopreventive effect of ITCs. Below, we will focus on epigenetic mechanisms in in vitro and in vivo studies in skin, breast, lung, colon, and prostate cancer, as well as some clinical chemoprevention studies with ITCs. Skin cancer The ITCs show chemopreventive effects against UV- and chemically induced skin carcinogenesis ( [81](javascript:;)) and the involvement of the epigenetics carcinogenesis has been studied in melanoma ( [82](javascript:;)). The activity of SFN on epigenetic regulation of skin cancer has been reported on PcG proteins' (e.g., Bmi1 and EZH2) function by means of blocking tumor progression through their inhibition thus decreasing H3K27me3 level ( [83](javascript:;)). In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), SFN treatment suppressed cancer progression and metastasis in reduction in arginine methylation at H3 ( [84](javascript:;)). As discussed earlier, UVB would drive perturbation of CpG methylome at initiation, promotion, and progression stages of skin carcinogenesis, but importantly, SFN would block carcinogenesis more effectively at early stages than late stages and would attenuate some of the perturbations of UVB-induced CpG methylome ( [85](javascript:;)). In cell culture model, SFN was also found to demethylate CpGs of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) promoter, resulting in reactivation of JB6 cells ( [86](javascript:;)). Such induced NRF2 expression was to promoter hypomethylation through down-regulation of and activity first isolated and identified SFN ( [87](javascript:;)), and he also advanced the concept of induction of phase II detoxifying genes Kelch-like protein-1 (KEAP1), prevent proteasomal degradation, allow newly synthesized NRF2 to enter the nucleus, and enhance NRF2-target gene transcription (reviewed in refs. [89-91](javascript:;)). Interestingly, however, electrophile such as SFN and oxidant such as H2O2 may also regulate NRF2 via redox sensitive cysteine on the nuclear export signal ( [92](javascript:;)) as well as posttranscriptional/translation control of NRF2's internal ribosomal entry sites ( [93](javascript:;)). Question remains, how these different redox signaling of NRF2 would operate under different redox environments such as different redox agents, acute versus chronic redox agent's stimulating conditions and pathologic conditions. Lung cancer Several studies show an inverse relationship between consumption of dietary ITCs and lung cancer risk ( [94](javascript:;)). In vitro cell culture study shows the involvement of SFN and miR-616-5p in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) metastasis ( [95](javascript:;)). miR-616-5p directly GSK3 expression, whereas SFN decreased miR-616-5p by histone modification, and followed by inactivation of the GSK3/-catenin signaling pathway and inhibition of EMT in NSCLC cells and H1299 lung cancer cells ( [56](javascript:;)). In lung cancer stem cells (CSC) miR-19a and expression are upregulated and SFN suppresses human lung cancer A549 cells, SFN epigenetically demethylates the CpG sites reactivates miR-9-3 expression ( [97](javascript:;)). and downregulation of c-MYC in NSCLC, potentially results in inhibition of cancer stem-like cell properties and cisplatin resistance ( [98](javascript:;)). Colon cancer In colon cancer model, SFN suppressed tumor development in Apc(min) mice, increased acetylated histones in the polyps, and inhibited HDAC in APC(min) ( [99](javascript:;)). SFN treatment in human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells showed increased activation of NRF2 by demethylation of the NRF2 promoter region and reducing expression of DNMT1 ( [100](javascript:;)). In polyposis in rat colon (Pirc) model, single oral administration of SFN and structurally related long-chain ITCs decreased HDAC3 expression and pH2AX colon polyps ( [55](javascript:;)). HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cells study showed that SFN or its analogs altered HAT/HDAC activities and histone acetylation status, lowered acetyltransferase 2A PEITC-enriched mouse-diet reduced mucosal and via modulating regulating NFB proteins and NFB mRNA expression was inversely correlated with trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 near its promoter region in a time-dependent manner ( [101](javascript:;)). Interestingly, colon cancer cells treated with low-dose PEITC for >1 month exhibited stable alterations in expression profile of epigenetic writers/erasers and chromatin binding [102](javascript:;)). Sustained PEITC exposure not only blocked HDAC protein binding to euchromatin but was also associated with hypomethylation of PcG target genes that are typically hypermethylated in cancer ( [102](javascript:;)). In human colon cancer cells, ITCs inhibit HDAC enzyme activity and increase HDAC protein turnover and ITCs enhanced the acetylation and subsequent degradation of critical repair proteins, such as CtIP ( [103](javascript:;)). Breast cancer Studies show that SFN modulates breast cancer risk at multiple stages of carcinogenesis different biologic mechanisms including epigenetic modulations ( [104](javascript:;)). SFN inhibited in dose and time dependent of hTERT in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. DNMT1 and DNMT3a, were decreased in SFN-treated breast cancer cells suggesting that SFN may repress hTERT by impacting epigenetic pathways ( combination studies, SFN and EGCG activated ER MDA-MB-231 cells which was associated with significant reduction of DNMTs expression and activity, as well as of HDAC activity ( [106](javascript:;)). Synergistic effect on MDA-MB-231 sprout diet tumor p16INK4a and downregulates tumor-promoting genes TERT and c-Myc potentially inhibition of expression and reduced volumes/sizes ( [109](javascript:;)). Prostate cancer In prostate cancer, SFN reactivated and induced its downstream antioxidant stress pathway in TRAMP-C1 cells through epigenetic modification of NRF2 promoter, and could play a role in chemoprevention ( [110](javascript:;)). The expression of long ncRNAs (lncRNA) in prostate cancer cells was altered and SFN restored the altered expression of lncRNAs ( [111](javascript:;)). Increased SFN consumption in mice with prostate cancer cell xenografts showed reduced HDAC enzyme activity in prostates, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC; ref. [112](javascript:;)). SFN inhibited the expression and activity of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). SFN treatment selectively decreased HDAC activity, and class and II HDAC protein's expression increased acetylated histone H3 at the P21, induced p21 expression, and increased tubulin acetylation in prostate cells [113](javascript:;)). Cancer Chemoprevention by ITCs via Nonepigenetic Signaling Pathways Numerous studies have shown that many nonepigenetic mechanisms by which ITCs exert their biological anticarcinogenic activities have been being well investigated including induction of carcinogen detoxication ( [114](javascript:;)), enhanced through NFB cells ( [123](javascript:;)), among others. As discussed above, the most studied and most relevant signaling pathway in the context of cancer prevention elicited by ITCs would be the NRF2-mediated signaling pathway. As reviewed by many scientists, and discussed above, ITCs react with sulfhydryl groups of C residues of Keap1, releasing NRF2 from Keap1 binding and then NRF2 translocating to the nucleus, partnering with sMafs and binding to the ARE found in many antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes including GSTs, thioredoxin, NQO-1, HO-1, among others ( [124-128](javascript:;)). Many studies have also shown that the ITCs are potent antiinflammatory agents. SFN significantly reduced the nuclear translocation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NFB in pancreatic acinar cells, downregulating the expression of NFB target genes code for proinflammatory mediators, such as TNF, IL1, IL6, activity metabolizing enzymes ( [130-132](javascript:;)), such as downregulating CYP3A2 mRNA expression, as well as the activity of benzyloxyquinoline debenzylase, a marker of CYP3As and upregulating CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA expression and the of a marker of CYP1A1/2 activities ( [133](javascript:;)). Some procarcinogens require activation by phase I enzymes to become active carcinogens capable of binding DNA and forming cancer-causing DNA adducts ( [134](javascript:;)). Inhibition of specific CYP enzymes involved in carcinogen activation has been found to prevent the development of cancer in animal models ( [135](javascript:;)). In additional, ITCs have been shown to modulate the expression of cell-cycle regulators, cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), and trigger apoptosis in cancer cell lines ( [136](javascript:;)). For example, in a mouse model of colorectal cancer, PEITC administration reduced both the number and size of polyps and these alternations were associated with activation of the CDK inhibitor, p21, inhibition of various of apoptosis ( [137](javascript:;)). ITCs also have been shown to suppress the formation of capillary-like structures from human umbilical endothelial cells and likely inhibit the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors that control angiogenesis in endothelial cells and malignant cell lines inhibition of As discussed above for [139](javascript:;)), SFN has been shown to induce autophagy in both in vitro cell culture models and in vivo models associated with decreased cell proliferation, alterations in protein levels of autophagy regulators Atg5 and phospho-mTOR of cell migration and invasion ( [141-143](javascript:;)), have also been reported. Question remains how these nonepigenetic signaling pathways would be linked and integrated with epigenetic mechanisms elicited by ITCs in the context of cancer prevention necessitates further study. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Dietary ITCs Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, a quantitative science, integrate and evaluate the dose/concentration-response relationships in the body following the administration of drugs ( [144, 145](javascript:;)). Despite many reports studying the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of ITCs, there are not many showing the \"direct quantitative relationship\" between the dose/concentration of ITCs and the biological/pharmacologic response(s) in in vivo animal models or in humans. In absorption, after oral administration of SFN in the rats the peak concentration (Cmax) were reported to be attained in 1 hour, indicating rapid absorption ( [146](javascript:;)). However, increasing the dose of SFN from 0.5-5 mg/kg, the oral absorption rate constant (kab) decreased and Cmax did not increase proportionally to the dose, suggesting nonlinear absorption kinetics ( [146](javascript:;)). In human, SFN was absorbed rapidly and achieved Cmax in 1 hour after the consumption of broccoli sprout products ( [147, 148](javascript:;)). Comparison blood/plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) AUC0-24 values between the intravenous and oral treatment groups, at low dose (2.8 mol/kg) shows an absolute bioavailability of 82%, which decreased to 20% at the higher dose (28 mol/kg; ref. [146](javascript:;)). In drug distribution, a rapid decrease was observed in the plasma concentration of SFN after both oral and intravenous dosing indicating rapid and extensive cellular uptake into various tissues ( [146](javascript:;)). This is consistent with studies showing ITCs achieve very high intracellular concentrations as a result of their interaction with GSH ( [149-151](javascript:;)). Such extensive intracellular localization explains the very large apparent volume of distribution (Vd) of 102 L/kg after intravenous injection in rat. In addition, the Vd of SFN decreased dramatically from 102 to 42 L/kg with increasing doses from 0.5 to 5.0 mg/kg ( [146](javascript:;)), showing nonlinear Vd. In another study of SFN pharmacokinetics, the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was around 3.7 L or 14.8 L/kg after an intravenous dose of 25 mg/kg of SFN ( [152](javascript:;)) and this result is Hanlon findings ( [146](javascript:;)). Freeze-dried aqueous extract of sprouts inhibited development induced by N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine significantly and dose-dependently, with over 70% of the ITCs present in the extract were excreted in the urine as ITC equivalents (ITCs + dithiocarbamates) within 12 hours after a single oral dose, indicating substantial urinary excretion ( [153](javascript:;)). Urinary concentrations of ITC equivalents were 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than those in plasma ( [153](javascript:;)). In a cross-over human study (SFR), (in approximately 12-hour collections after dosing), was substantially greater with the SFN-rich (mean = 70%) than with GRR (mean = 5%) beverages ( [154](javascript:;)). These studies again suggest that substantial renal excretion of ITC or its metabolites occur. In terms of pharmacodynamics, several studies have reported the increased levels of Nrf2-targeted enzymes GSTs and NQO1in plasma ( [155](javascript:;)) and saliva ( [156](javascript:;)) in humans volunteers after consuming cruciferous vegetables. Similarly administration of SFN-rich preparations to healthy subjects led to increased mRNA or protein levels of NQO1 and GSTs in skin punch biopsies, blood cells, and buccal scrapings ( [157-159](javascript:;)). As a proof-of-concept study, after intravenous 25 mg/kg of SFN, moderate increase in mRNA (2-5 folds) of HO-1, NRF2, NQO1, [152](javascript:;)). These pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic effects of SFN could be modeled with indirect response model directly linking plasma SFN concentrations with NRF2-mediated gene expression response in lymphocytes ( [152](javascript:;)). Future studies involving integrating acute pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and long-term cancer preventive effects of ITCs in human would be needed. Ongoing Clinical Studies/Trials of ITCs and Chemoprevention Preclinical carcinogenesis studies of dietary ITCs have demonstrated extraordinary chemopreventive efficacy. Several clinical trials have illustrated that ITCs, administered orally as glucosinolate precursors or directly in its bioactive compound such as SFN, PEITC have preventive effects against cancers ( [160, 161](javascript:;)). Specifically, SFN and PEITC have been studied in some clinical studies and briefly summarized in [Table 1](javascript:;) ( [162-168](javascript:;)). More ongoing ITCs clinical trials are listed in [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov). In one particular clinical study involving male patient with recurrent prostate cancer, none of the patients experienced PSA doubling, a marker for disease severity, after serving SFN daily for 20 weeks ( [169](javascript:;)). HDAC expression and activity inhibition has been used as a biomarker in some trials ( [170, 171](javascript:;)) and one clinical study with healthy subjects showed that HDAC activity was significantly inhibited in PBMCs as early as 3 hours after consumption of 68 g of broccoli sprouts ( [112](javascript:;)). Study using SFN in patients with breast cancer showed an average decrease of 80.39 pmol/minute/mg protein in blood HDAC activity from preintervention to postintervention ( [166](javascript:;)). A clinical study of PEITC as an inhibitor of metabolic activation of a tobacco-specific lung carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) for cancer prevention, the NNK metabolic activation ratio was significant reduced by 7.7% ( [168](javascript:;)). ITCs have shown promising efficacy in various clinical cancer chemoprevention trials; however, future clinical trials involving epigenetic endpoints are smokers; repair cancer; times/day; 12 with SFN in former smokers| |Prostate||90 men with prostate cancer recurrence; 60 mg of SFN daily; 6 months||log PSA slope significantly (165)| |98 men prostate biopsy; daily; 4 weeks||Targets: by in human cancer tissue/cells| |40 prostate cancer patients; 64 mg SFN daily, days||Change in by |PEITC/Watercress||Lung||11 smokers; repair cancer; times/day; 12 with SFN in former smokers| |Prostate||90 men with prostate cancer recurrence; 60 mg of SFN daily; 6 months||log PSA slope significantly (165)| |98 men prostate biopsy; daily; 4 weeks||Targets: by in human cancer tissue/cells| |40 prostate cancer patients; 64 mg SFN daily, days||Change in by |PEITC/Watercress||Lung||11 Prospective ITCs found abundantly in the human diet and are derived from cruciferous vegetables, are highly promising cancer preventive agents. Multiple and multitargeted mechanisms, including epigenetic reprograming, could be involved in the preventive and therapeutic effects of ITCs in cancer. Gene silencing through hypermethylation of CpG of tumor onco/proto-oncogenes, gene activation through hypomethylation of CpG of tumor suppressor genes, and other modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination are potential cellular targets of epigenetic regulation by ITCs. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis might help to better understand the targeted tissue specificity and global events in the regulation by ITCs. Extensive research on the extrapolation of preclinical to clinical dosages of ITCs for prevention studies needs to be further refined. Understanding of the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of parent/metabolites of the ITCs, its tissue levels and modulation of signaling mechanisms including epigenetic mechanisms is warranted in human studies. Cancer is a complex chronic disease and cancer development is a multistep process ( [1, 2, 12, 172, 173](javascript:;)). The ITCs as discussed above belongs to a very powerful class of biologically active food components, they are relatively nontoxic at low physiologic and even higher pharmacologic doses, with properties as well as with great anticancer efficacy in many in vitro cell culture models and in vivo animal models. The exact molecular mechanism of how the ITCs as well as many other dietary chemopreventive phytochemicals modifying the epigenetic machinery is currently unclear. However, it is highly likely through redox biological process playing an important role ( [60](javascript:;)) analogous to the kinases/caspases activation as we have discussed back in the 1990s ( [174-176](javascript:;)). In addition, it would be tempting to speculate that the ITCs particularly SFN and PEITC, although differ in some aspects of signaling pathways (at same micromolar concentrations, SFN is a more potent NRF2 activator than PEITC, and SFN activates ERK more strongly to JNK, whereas PEITC would be reversed ( [123, 177, 178](javascript:;)), they would be considered as \"general\" cancer preventive agents not unlike the chemotherapeutic agents such as platinum-based or the taxane-based drugs. Analogous to chemotherapeutic agents, for maximal efficacy, the ITCs would need to be used in combination with other cancer preventive agents including other less toxic dietary phytochemicals, natural products or drugs such as NSAIDs, selective estrogen receptor modulator, aromatase inhibitors, and 5--reductase inhibitors ( [179](javascript:;)) targeting different signaling pathways. Together with other considerations and initiatives such as immunoprevention ( [180-182](javascript:;)), the long-term control and prevention of progression of tumors to advanced and metastatic states may soon to be realized.
