Mao's editorial about challenges of managing chronic pain called for \"considering integrative approaches such as acupuncture\" citing a \"survey of selected physician views\" and the new guideline from the American College of Physicians.(1, see 9 in 1) This deserves strong comment. First, \"integrative medicine\" belongs to a long list of oxymorons (eg. complementary and alternative medicine, holistic medicine, natural medicine, unorthodox medicine, fringe medicine, unconventional medicine, new age medicine): these interchangeable practices have no relation with modern medicine. Evidence Based Medicine uses evidence from well-designed and conducted research to improve decisions by individual physicians about individual patients.) Second, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) final guidance specifically recommended acupuncture not be used for managing low back pain as evidence is lacking.(https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng59) Indeed, effects after acupuncture lack clinical relevance and are undistinguishable from bias.

Last, there is accumulating robust evidence that cognitive behavioral therapies, a term absent from Mao's editorial, provide prolonged clinically relevant decrease in pain and functional limitations.(3,4) 1 Mao J.
