This provision requires that these national coverage policies be designed to promote program integrity and national uniformity and simplify administrative requirements with respect to clinical diagnostic laboratory services in connection with the following: Beneficiary information required to be submitted with each claim or order for laboratory services; The medical condition for which a laboratory test is reasonable and necessary (within the meaning of section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act); The appropriate use of procedure codes in billing for a laboratory test, including the unbundling of laboratory services; The medical documentation that is required by a Medicare contractor at the time a claim is submitted for a laboratory test (in accordance with section 1833(e) of the Act); Record keeping requirements in addition to any information required to be submitted with a claim, including physicians' obligations regarding these requirements; Procedures for filing claims and for providing remittances by electronic media; and Limitations on frequency of coverage for the same services performed on the same individual. On March 10, 2000, a proposed rule was published in the Federal Register (65 FR 13082) that set forth uniform national coverage and administrative policies for clinical diagnostic laboratory services. These proposed policies reflected the consensus of the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee. The final rule, published in the Federal Register on November 23, 2001 (66 FR 58788), addresses the public comments received on the proposed rule. The final rule established the national coverage and administrative policies for clinical diagnostic laboratory service s payable under Medicare Part B. It promotes Medicare program integrity and national uniformity, and simplifies administrative requirements for clinical diagnostic services. There are 23 national coverage determinations included in the final rule listed below: Culture, Bacterial, Urine Human Immunodeficiency Virus Testing (Prognosis including monitoring) Human Immunodeficiency Virus Testing (Diagnosis) Blood Counts Partial Thromboplastin Time Prothrombin Time Serum Iron Studies Collagen Crosslinks, Any Method Blood Glucose Testing Glycated Hemoglobin/Glycated Protein Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 2 October 2014 Thyroid Testing Lipids Digoxin Therapeutic Drug Assay Alpha- Gonadotropin Tumor Antigen 125 Tumor Antigen by Immunoassay CA 15- 3/CA 27.29 Tumor Antigen by Immunoassay Prostate Specific Antigen Gamma Glutamyl Transferase Hepatitis Panel/Acute Hepatitis Panel Fecal Occult Blood What Is a National Coverage Policy? Part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act) provides for Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) for certain Medicare beneficiaries, specifying what health care items or services will be covered by the Medicare Part B program. Diagnostic laboratory tests are generally covered under Part B, unless excluded from coverage by the Act. Services that are excluded from coverage include routine physical examinations and services that are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. CMS interprets these provisions to prohibit coverage of screening services, including laboratory tests furnished in the absence of signs, symptoms, or personal history of disease or injury, except as explicitly authorized by statute. A test may be considered medically appropriate, but nonetheless be excluded from Medicare coverage by statute. A national coverage policy for diagnostic laboratory test(s) is a document stating CMS's policy with respect to the circumstances under which the test(s) will be considered reasonable and necessary, and not screening, for Medicare purposes. Such a policy applies nationwide. A national coverage policy is neither a practice parameter nor a statement of the accepted standard of medical practice. Words such as ''may be indicated'' or ''may be considered medically necessary'' are used for this reason. Where a policy gives a general description and then lists examples (following words like ''for example'' or ''including''), the list of examples is not meant to be all- inclusive but to provide some guidance. What Is the Effect of a National Coverage Policy? A national coverage policy to which this introduction applies is a N ational Coverage Decision (NCD) under section 1862(a) (1) of the Social Security Act. Regulations on National Coverage Decisions are codified at 42 CFR 405.732(b) -(d). A Medicare contractor may not develop a local policy that conflicts with a national coverage policy. What Is the Format for These National Coverage Policies? Below are the headings for national coverage policies, developed by the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee on Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Tests. Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 3 October 2014 Other Names/Abbreviations This section identifies other names for the policy. It reflects more colloquial terminology. Description This section includes a description of the test(s) addressed by the policy and provides a general description of the appropriate uses of the test(s). HCPCS Codes The descriptor(s) used in this section is (are) the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) or other CMS Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). The CPT is developed and copyrighted by the American Medical Association (AMA). If a descriptor does not accurately or fully describe the test, a more complete description may be included elsewhere in the policy, such as in the Indications section. ICD-9- CM Codes Covered by Medicare Program This section includes covered codes \u2014those where there is a presumption of medical necessity, but the claim is subject to review to determine whether the test was in fact reasonable and necessary. The diagnosis codes are from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9- CM). Where the policy takes an ''exclusionary'' approach, as described below, this section states: ''Any ICD -9-CM code not listed in either of the ICD -9-CM code sections below.'' Indications This section lists detailed clinical indications for Medicare coverage of the test(s). Limitations This section lists any national frequency expectations, as well as other limitations on Medicare coverage of the specific test(s) addressed in the policy \u2014for example, if it would be unnecessary to perform a particular test with a particular combination of diagnoses. ICD-9- CM Codes That Do Not Support Medical Necessity This section lists/describes generally non- covered codes for which there are only limited exceptions. However, additional documentation could support a determination of medical necessity in certain circumstances. Subject to section 1879 of the Social Security Act (the Act), 42 CFR 411, subpart K, section 7330 of the Medicare Carriers Manual section 3440- 3446.9 of the Medicare Fiscal Intermediary Manual and any applicable rulings, it would be appropriate for the ordering physician or the laboratory to obtain an advance beneficiary notice from the beneficiary. Where the policy takes an ''inclusionary'' approach, as described below, this section states: ''Any ICD -9-CM code not listed in either of the ICD -9-CM sections above.'' Other Comments This section may contain other relevant comments that are not addressed in the sections above. Documentation Requirements This section refers to documentation requirements for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests at 42 CFR 410.32(d) and includes any specific documentation requirements related to the test(s) addressed in the policy. Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 4 October 2014 Sources of Information Relevant sources of information used in developing the policy are listed in this section. Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 5 October 2014 Non-covered ICD-9-CM Codes for All NCDs This section lists codes that are never covered. If a code from this section is given as the reason for the tes t, the test may be billed to the Medicare beneficiary without billing Medicare first because the service is not covered by statute, in most instances because it is performed for screening purposes and is not within an exception. The beneficiary, however, does have a right to have the claim submitted to Medicare, upon request.

It includes CMS's interpretation of its longstanding policies and is included for informational purposes. Tests for screening purposes that are performed in the absence of signs, symptoms, complaints, or personal history of disease or injury are not covered except as explicitly authorized by statute. These include exams required by insurance companies, business establishments, government agencies, or other third parties. Tests that are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury are not covered according to the statute. Failure to provide documentation of the medical necessity of tests may result in denial of claims. The documentation may include notes documenting relevant signs, symptoms, or abnormal findings that substantiate the medical necessity for ordering the tests. In addition, failure to provide independent verification that the test was ordered by the treating physician (or qualified nonphysician practitioner) through documentation in the physician's office may result in denial. A claim for a test for which there is a national coverage or local medical review policy will be denied as not reasonable and necessary if it is submitted without an ICD -9-CM code or narrative diagnosis listed as covered in the policy unless other medical documentation justifying the necessity is submitted with the claim. If a national or local policy identifies a frequency expectation, a claim for a test that exceeds that expectation may be denied as not reasonable and necessary, unless it is submitted with documentation justifying increased frequency. Tests that are not ordered by a treating physician or other qualified treating nonphysician practitioner acting within the scope of their license and in compliance w ith Medicare requirements will be denied as not reasonable and necessary. Failure of the laboratory performing the test to have the appropriate Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) certificate for the testing performed will result in denial of claims. Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 8 October 2014 Coding Guidelines for All NCDs 1. Any claim for a clinical diagnostic laboratory service must be submitted with an ICD -9- CM diagnosis code. Codes that describe symptoms and signs, as opposed to diagnosis, should be provided for reporting purposes when a diagnosis has not been established by the physician. (Based on Coding Clinic for ICD -9-CM, Fourth Quarter 1995, page 43). 2. Screening is the testing for disease or disease precursors so that early detection and treatment can be provided for those who test positive for the disease. Screening tests are performed when no specific sign, symptom, or diagnosis is present and the patient has not been exposed to a disease. The testing of a person to rule out or to confirm a suspected diagnosis because the patient has a sign and/or symptom is a diagnostic test, not a screening. In these cases, the sign or symptom should be used to explain the reason for the test. When the reason for performing a test is because the patient has had contact with, or exposure to, a communicable disease, the appropriate code from category V01, Contact with or exposure to communicable diseases, should be assigned, not a screening code, but the test may still be considered screening and not covered by Medicare. For screening tests, the appropriate ICD -9-CM screening code from categories V28 or V73- V82 (or comparable narrative) should be used. (From Coding Clinic for ICD-9- CM, Fourth Quarter 1996, pages 50 and 52). 3. A three- digit code is to be used only if it is not further subdivided. Where fourth -digit and/or fifth- digit sub -classifications are provided, they must be assigned. A code is invalid if it has not been coded to the full number of digits required for that code. (From Coding Clinic for ICD-9- CM. Fourth Quarter, 1995, page 44). 4. Diagnoses documented as \"probable,\" \"suspected,\" \"questionable,\" \"rule- out,\" or \"working diagnosis\" should not be coded as though they exist. Rather, code the condition(s) to the highest degree of certainty for that encounter/visit, such as signs, symptoms, abnormal test results, exposure to communicable disease or other reasons for the visit. (From Coding Clinic for ICD-9- CM, Fourth Quarter 1995, page 45). 5. When a non- specific ICD -9 code is submitted, the underlying sign, symptom, or condition must be related to the indications for the test. Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 9 October 2014 Additional Coding Guidelines 190.12 - Urine Culture, Bacterial 1. Specific coding guidelines: a. Use CPT 87086 Culture, bacterial, urine; quantitative, colony count where a urine culture colony count is performed to determine the approximate number of bacteria present per milliliter of urine. The number of units of service is determined by the number of specimens. b. Use CPT 87088 where a commercial kit uses manufacturer defined media for isolatio n, presumptive identification, and quantitation of morphotypes present. The number of units of service is determined by the number of specimens. c. Use CPT 87088 where identification of morphotypes recovered by quantitative culture or commercial kits and deemed to represent significant bacteriuria requires the use of additional testing, for example, biochemical test procedures on colonies. Identification based solely on visual observation of the primary media is usually not adequate to justify use of this code. The number of units of service is determined by the number of isolates. d. Use CPT 87184 or 87186 where susceptibility testing of isolates deemed to be significant is performed concurrently with identification. The number of units of service is determined by the number of isolates. These codes are not exclusively used for urine cultures but are appropriate for isolates from other sources as well. e. Appropriate combinations are as follows: CPT 87086, 1 per specimen with 87088, 1 per isolate and 87184 or 87186 where appropriate. f. Culture for other specific organism groups not ordinarily recovered by media used for aerobic urine culture may require use of additional CPT codes (for example, anaerobes from suprapubic samples). g. Identification of isolates by non- routine, nonbiochemical methods may be coded appropriately (for example, immunologic identification of streptococci, nucleic acid techniques for identification of N. gonorrhoeae). h. While infrequently used, sensitivity studies by methods other than CPT 87184 or 87186 are appropriate. CPT 87188, dilution method, each antibiotic may be used. The number of units of service is the number of antibiotics multiplied by the number of unique isolates. 2. ICD-9- CM code 780.02, 780.9 or 799.3 should be used only in the situation of an elderly patient, immunocompromised patient or patient with neurologic disorder who presents without typical manifestations of a urinary tract infection but who presents with one of the following signs or symptoms, not otherwise explained by another co- existing condition: increasing debility; declining functional status; acute mental changes; changes in awareness; or hypothermia. 3. In cases of post renal -transplant urine culture used to detect clinically significant occult infection in patients on long term immunosuppressive therapy, use code V58.69. Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 10 October 2014 190.13 - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Testing (Prognosis Including Monitoring) 1. Specific coding guidelines: a. Temporary code G0100 has been superseded by code 87536 effective January 1, 1998. b. CPT codes for quantification should not be used simultaneously with other nucleic acid detection codes for HIV -1 (that is, 87534, 87535) or HIV -2 (that is, 87537, 87538). 2. Codes 647.60 -647.64 should only be used for HIV infections complicating pregnancy. 190.14 - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Testing (Diagnosis) 1. Specific coding guidelines: a. CPT 86701 or 86703 is performed initially. CPT 86702 is performed when 86701 is negative and clinical suspicion of HIV -2 exists. b. CPT 86689 is performed only on samples repeatedly positive by 86701, 86702, or 86703. c. CPT 87534 or 87535 is to detect HIV -1 RNA where indicated. CPT 87537 or 87538 is used to detect HIV- 2 RNA where indicated. 190.16 - Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) 1. When patients are being converted from heparin therapy to warfarin therapy, use code V58.61 to document the medical necessity of the PTT. 2. When coding for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), use 286.6 or code for the signs and symptoms clinically indicating DIC. 3. If a specific condition is known and is the reason for a pre- operative test, submit the clinical text description or ICD -9-CM code describing the condition with the order/referral. If a specific condition or disease is not known, and the pre -operative test is for pre -operative clearance only, assign code V72.84. 4. Assign codes 289.8 - other specified disease of blood and blood- forming organs only when a specific disease exists and is indexed to 289.8, (for example, myelofibrosis). Do not assign code 289.8 to report a patient on long term use of anticoagulant therapy (for example, to report a PTT value or re- check need for medication adjustment.) Assign code V58.61 to referrals for PTT checks or re- checks. (Reference AHA's Coding Clinic, March -April, pg 12 - 1987, 2nd quarter pg 8 - 1989) 190.17 - Prothrombin Time (PT) 1. If a specific condition is known and is the reason for a pre- operative test, submit the text descripti on or ICD -9-CM code describing the condition with the order/referral. If a specific condition or disease is not known, and the pre- operative test is for pre- operative clearance only, assign code V72.84. 2. Assign codes 289.8 - other specified disease of blood and blood- forming organs only when a specific disease exists and is indexed to 289.8 (for example, myelofibrosis). Do not assign code 289.8 to report a patient on long term use of anticoagulant therapy (e.g. to report a PT value or re- check need for medication adjustment.) Assign code Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 11 October 2014 V58.61 to referrals for PT checks or re- checks. (Reference AHA's Coding Clinic, March -April, pg 12 - 1987, 2nd quarter pg 8 - 1989) 190.19 - Collagen Crosslinks, Any Method 1. When the indication for the test is long -term administration of glucocorticosteroids, use ICD-9- CM code V58.69. 190.20 - Blood Glucose Testing 1. A diagnostic statement of impaired glucose tolerance must be evaluated in the context of the documentation in the medical record in order to assign the most accurate ICD -9- CM code. An abnormally elevated fasting blood glucose level in the absence of the diagnosis of diabetes is classified to Code 790.6 - other abnormal blood chemistry. If the provider bases the diagnostic statement of impaired glucose tolerance\" on an abnormal glucose tolerance test, the condition is classified to 790.2 -- normal glucose tolerance test. Both conditions are considered indications for ordering glycated hemoglobin or glycated protein testing in the absence of the diagnosis of di abetes mellitus. 2. When a patient is under treatment for a condition for which the tests in this policy are applicable, the ICD -9-CM code that best describes the condition is most frequently listed as the reason for the test. 3. When laboratory testing is done solely to monitor response to medication, the most accurate ICD -9-CM code to describe the reason for the test would be V58.69 -- long term use of medication. 4. Periodic follow -up for encounters for laboratory testing for a patient with a prior history of a disease, who is no longer under treatment for the condition, would be coded with an appropriate code from the V67 category -- follow -up examination. 5. According to ICD -9-CM coding conventions, codes that appear in italics in the Alphabetic and/or Tabular columns of ICD -9-CM are considered manifestation codes that require the underlying condition to be coded and sequenced ahead of the manifestation. For example, the diagnostic statement, \"thyrotoxic exophthalmos (376.21),\" which appears in italics in the tabular listing, requires that the thyroid disorder (242.0 -242.9) is coded and sequenced ahead of thyrotoxic exophthalmos. Therefore, a diagnostic statement that is listed as a manifestation in ICD -9-CM must be expanded to include the underlying disease in order to accurately code the condition. 190.21 - Glycated Hemoglobin/Glycated Protein 1. A diagnostic statement of impaired glucose tolerance must be evaluated in the context of the documentation in the medical record in order to assign the most accurate ICD -9- CM code. An abnormally elevated fasting blood glucose level in the absence of the diagnosis of diabetes is classified to Code 790.6 - other abnormal blood chemistry. If the provider bases the diagnostic statement of impaired glucose tolerance\" on an abnormal glucose tolerance test, the condition is classified to 790.2 -- normal glucose tolerance test. Both conditions are considered indications for ordering glycated hemoglobin or glycated protein testing in the absence of the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 12 October 2014 190.22 - Thyroid Testing 1. When a patient is under treatment for a condition for which the tests in this policy are applicable, the ICD -9-CM code that best describes the condition is most frequently listed as the reason for the test. 2. When l aboratory testing is done solely to monitor response to medication, the most accurate ICD -9-CM code to describe the reason for the test would be V58.69 - long term use of medication. 3. Periodic follow -up for encounters for laboratory testing for a patient with a prior history of a disease, who is no longer under treatment for the condition, would be coded with an appropriate code from the V67 category -- follow -up examination. 4. According to ICD -9-CM coding conventions, codes that appear in italics in the Alphabetic and/or Tabular columns of ICD -9-CM are considered manifestation codes that require the underlying condition to be coded and sequenced ahead of the manifestation. For example, the diagnostic statement \"thyrotoxic exophthalmos (376.21),\" which appears in italics in the tabular listing, requires that the thyroid disorder (242.0 -242.9) is coded and sequenced ahead of thyrotoxic exophthalmos. Therefore, a diagnostic statement that is listed as a manifestation in ICD -9-CM must be expanded to include the underlying disease in order to accurately code the condition. 5. Use code 728.9 to report muscle weakness as the indication for the test. Other diagnoses included in 728.9 do not support medical necessity. 6. Use code 194.8 (Malignant neoplasm of other endocrine glands and related structures, other ) to report multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes (MEN -1 and MEN -2). Other diagnoses included in 194.8 do not support medical necessity. 190.26 - Carcinoembryonic Antigen 1. To show elevated CEA, use ICD -9-CM 790.99 (Other nonspecific findings on examination of blood) only if a more specific diagnosis has not been made. If a more specific diagnosis has been made, use the code for that diagnosis. 190.31 - Prostate Specific Antigen 1. To show elevated PSA, use IC D-9-CM code 790.93 (Elevated prostate specific antigen). If a more specific diagnosis code has been made, use the code for that diagnosis.

NCD 190.12 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 13 October 2014 190.12 - Urine Culture, Bacterial Other Names/Abbreviations Urine culture Description A bacterial urine culture is a laboratory procedure performed on a urine specimen to establish the probable etiology of a presumed urinary tract infection. It is common practice to do a urinalysis prior to a urine culture. A urine culture may also be used as part of the evaluation and management of another related condition. The procedure includes aerobic agar -based isolation of bacteria or other cultivable organisms present, and quantitation of types present based on morphologic criteria. Isolates deemed significant may be subjected to additional identification and susceptibility procedures as requested by the ordering physician. The physician's request may be through clearly documented and communicated laboratory protocols. HCPCS Codes (Alphanumeric, CPT AMA) Code Description 87086 Culture, bacterial; quantitative, colony count, urine. 87088 Culture, bacterial; with isolation and presumptive identification of each isolates, urine.

A patient's urinalysis is abnormal suggesting urinary tract infection, for example, positive bacteriuria screen by a non- culture technique; or other significant abnormality of a urinalysis. While it is not essential to evaluate a urine specimen by one of these methods before a urine culture is performed, certain clinical presentations with highly suggestive signs and symptoms may lend themselves to an antecedent urinalysis procedure where follow -up culture depends upon an initial positive or abnormal test result. 2. A patient has clinical signs and symptoms indicative of a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Acute lower UTI may present with urgency, frequency, nocturia, dysuria, discharge or incontinence. These findings may also be noted in upper UTI with additional systemic symptoms (for example, fever, chills, lethargy); or pain in the costovertebral, abdominal, or pelvic areas. Signs and symptoms may overlap considerably with other inflammatory conditions of the genitourinary tract (for example, prostatitis, urethritis, vaginitis, or cervicitis). Elderly or immunocompromised patients, or patients with neurologic disorders may present atypically (for example, general debility, acute mental status changes, declining functional status). 3. The patient is being evaluated for suspected urosepsis, fever of unknown origin, or other systemic manifestations of infection but without a known source. Signs and symptoms used to define sepsis have been well established. 4. A test -of cure is generally not indicated in an uncomplicated infection. However, it may be indicated if the patient is being evaluated for response to therapy and there is a complicating co -existing urinary abnormality including structural or functional abnormalities, calculi, foreign bodies, or ureteral/renal stents or there is clinical or laboratory evidence of failure to respond as described in Indications 1 and 2.

In surgical procedures involving major manipulations of the genitourinary tract, preoperative examination to detect occult infection may be indicated in selected cases (for example, prior to renal transplantation, manipulation or removal of kidney stones, or transurethral surgery of the bladder or prostate). 6. Urine culture may be indicated to detect occult infection in renal transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy. Limitations 1. CPT 87086 may be used one time per encounte r. 2. Colony count restrictions on coverage of CPT 87088 do not apply as they may be highly variable according to syndrome or other clinical circumstances (for example, antecedent therapy, collection time, and degree of hydration). 3. CPT 87088 may be used multiple times in association with or independent of 87086, as urinary tract infections may be polymicrobial. 4. Testing for asymptomatic bacteriuria as part of a prenatal evaluation may be medically appropriate but is considered screening and therefore not covered by Medicare. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has concluded that screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria outside of the narrow indication for pregnant women is generally not indicated. There are insufficient data to recommend screening in ambulatory elderly patients including those with diabetes. Testing may be clinically indicated on other grounds including likelihood of recurrence or potential adverse effects of antibiotics, but is considered screening in the absence of clinical or laboratory evidence of infection.

Assays vary both in methods used to detect viral RNA as well as in ability to detect viral levels at lower limits. However, all employ some type of nucleic acid amplification technique to enhance sensitivity, and results are expressed as the HIV copy number. Quantification assays of HIV plasma RNA are used prognostically to assess relative risk for disease progression and predict time to death, as well as to assess efficacy of anti -retroviral therapies over time. HIV quantification is often performed together with CD4+ T cell counts which provide information on extent of HIV induced immune system damage already incurred.

Regular periodic measurement of plasma HIV RNA levels may be medically necessary to determine risk for disease progression in an HIV -infected individual and to determine when to initiate anti- retroviral treatment regimens. 3. In clinical situations where risk of HIV infection is significant and initiation of therapy is anticipated, a baseline HI V quantification may be performed. These situations include: a. Persistence of borderline or equivocal serologic reactivity in an at -risk individual. b. Signs and symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome characterized by fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy and rash in an at -risk individual. Limitations 1. Viral quantification may be appropriate for prognostic use including baseline determination, periodic monitoring, and monitoring of response to therapy. Use as a diagnostic test method is not indicated. 2. Measur ement of plasma HIV RNA levels should be performed at the time of establishment of an HIV infection diagnosis. For an accurate baseline, 2 specimens in a 2-week period are appropriate. 3. For prognosis including anti -retroviral therapy monitoring, regular, periodic measurements are appropriate. The frequency of viral load testing should be consistent with the most current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for use of anti -retroviral agents in adults and adolescents or pediatrics. 4. Because differences in absolute HIV copy number are known to occur using different assays, plasma HIV RNA levels should be measured by the same analytical method. A change in assay method may necessitate re- establishment of a baseline. 5. Nucleic acid quantification techniques are representative of rapidly emerging & evolving new technologies.

These assays take one of two forms: antibody detection assays and specific HIV antigen (p24) procedures. The antibody assays are usually enzyme immunoass ays (EIA) which are used to confirm exposure of an individual's immune system to specific viral antigens. These assays may be formatted to detect HIV -1, HIV -2, or HIV -1 and 2 simultaneously and to detect both IgM and IgG. When the initial EIA test is repeatedly positive or indeterminate , an alternative test is used to confirm the specificity of the antibodies to individual viral components. The most commonly used method is the Western Blot. The HIV -1 core antigen (p24) test detects circulating viral antigen which may be found prior to the development of antibodies and may also be present in later stages of illness in the form of recurrent or persistent antigenemia. Its prognostic utility in HIV infection has been diminished as a result of development of sensitive viral RNA assays, and its primary use today is as a routine screening tool in potential blood donors. In several unique situations, serologic testing alone may not reliably establish an HIV infection. This may occur because the antibody response (particularly the IgG response detected by Western Blot) has not yet developed (that is, acute retroviral syndrome), or is persistently equivocal because of inherent viral antigen variability. It is also an issue in perinatal HIV infection due to transplacental passage of maternal HIV antibody. In these situations, laboratory evidence of HIV in blood by culture, antigen assays, or proviral DNA or viral RNA assays, is required to establish a definitive determination of HIV infection.

The patient has a documented, otherwise unexplained, AIDS -defining or AIDS- associated opportunistic infection. 2. The patient has another documented sexually transmitted disease which identifies significant risk of exposure to HIV and the potential for an early or subclinical infection. 3. The patient has documented acute or chronic hepatitis B or C infection that identifies a significant risk of exposure to HIV and the potential for an early or subclinical infection. 4. The patient has a documented AIDS -defining or AIDS -associated neoplasm. 5. The patient has a documented AIDS -associated neurologic disorder or otherwise unexplained dementia. 6. The patient has another documented AIDS -defining clinical condition, or a history of other severe, recurrent, or persistent conditions which suggest an underlying immune deficiency (for example, cutaneous or mucosal disorders). 7. The patient has otherwise unexplained generalized signs and symptoms suggestive of a chronic process with an underlying immune deficiency (for example, fever, weight loss, malaise, fatigue, chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, chronic cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, or lymphadenopathy). 8. The patient has otherwise unexplained laboratory evidence of a chronic disease process with an underlying immune deficiency (for example, anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, lymphopenia, or low CD4+ lymphocyte count). 9. The patient has signs and symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome with fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and skin rash. 10. The patient has documented exposure to blood or body fluids known to be capable of transmitting HIV (for example, needlesticks and other significant blood exposures) and antiviral therapy is initiated or anticipated to be initiated. 11. The patient is undergoing treatment for rape. (HIV testing is part of the rape treatment protocol.) Limitations 1. HIV antibody testing in the United States is usually performed using HIV -1 or HIV -\u00bd combination tests. HIV -2 testing is indicated if clinical circumstances suggest HIV -2 is likely (that is compatible clinical findings and HIV -1 test negative). HIV -2 testing may be indicated in areas of the country where there is greater prevalence of HIV -2 infections. 2. The Western Blot test should be performed only after documentation that the initial EIA tests are repeatedly positive or equivocal on a single sample. 3. The HIV antigen tests currently have no defined diagnostic usage. 4. Direct v iral RNA detection may be performed in those situations where serologic testing does not establish a diagnosis but strong clinical suspicion persists (for example, acute retroviral syndrome, nonspecific serologic evidence of HIV, or perinatal HIV infection ). 5. If initial serologic tests confirm an HIV infection, repeat testing is not indicated. Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. NCD 190.14 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 27 October 2014 6. If initial serologic tests are HIV EIA negative and there is no indication for confirmation of infection by viral RNA detection, the interval prior to retesting is 3 -6 months. 7. Testing for evidence of HIV infection using serologic methods may be medically appropriate in situations where there is a risk of exposure to HIV. However, in the absence of a documented AIDS defining or HIV -associated disease, an HIV -associated sign or symptom, or documented exposure to a known HIV -infected source, the testing is considered by Medicare to be screening and thus is not covered by Medicare (for example, history of multiple blood component transfusions, exposure to blood or body fluids not resulting in consideration of therapy, history of transplant, history of illicit drug use, multiple sexual partners, same- sex encounters, prostitution, or contact with prostitutes). 8. The CPT Editorial Panel has issued a number of codes for infectious agent detection by direct antigen or nucleic acid probe techniques that have not yet been developed or are only being used on an investigational basis. Laboratory providers are advised to remain current on FDA- approval status for these tests.

These include primary disorders such as anemia, leukemia, polycythemia, thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Many other conditions secondarily affect the blood or bone marrow, including reaction to inflammation and infections, coagulopathies, neoplasms and exposure to toxic substances. Many treatments and therapies affect the blood or bone marrow, and blood counts may be used to monitor treatment effects. The complete blood count (CBC) includes a hemogram and differential white blood count (WBC). The hemogram includes enumeration of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, as well as the determination of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and indices. The symptoms of hematological disorders are often nonspecific, and are commonly encountered in patients who may or may not prove to have a disorder of the blood or bone marrow. Furthermore, many medical conditions that are not primarily due to abnormalities of blood or bone marrow may have hematological manifestations that result from the disease or its treatment. As a result, the CBC is one of the most commonly indicated laboratory tests. In patients with possible hematological abnormalities, it may be necessary to determine the hemoglobin and hematocrit, to calculate the red cell indices, and to measure the concentration of white blood cells and platelets. These measurements are usually performed on a multichannel analyzer that measures all of the parameters on every sample. Therefore, laboratory assessments routinely include these measurements.

Indications for a CBC generally include the evaluation of bone marrow dysfunction as a result of neoplasms, therapeutic agents, exposure to toxic substances, or pregnancy. The CBC is also useful in assessing peripheral destruction of blood cells, suspected bone marrow failure or bone marrow infiltrate, suspected myeloproliferative, myelodysplastic, or lymphoproliferative processes, and immune disorders. 2. Indications for hemogram or CBC related to red cell (RBC) parameters of the hemogram include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease that can be associated with anemia or other red blood cell disorder (e.g., pallor, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, bleeding, acute injury associated with blood loss or suspected blood loss, abnormal menstrual bleeding, hematuria, hematemesis, hematochezia, positive fecal occult blood test, malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, malabsorption, neuropathy, known malignancy, presence of acute or chronic disease that may have associated anemia, coagulation or hemostatic disorders, postural dizziness, syncope, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, chronic marrow hypoplasia or decreased RBC production, tachycardia, systolic heart murmur, congestive the lower extremities). 3. Indications for hemogram or CBC related to red cell (RBC) parameters of the hemogram include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease that can be associated with polycythemia (for example, fever, chills, ruddy skin, conjunctival redness, cough, wheezing, cyanosis, clubbing of the fingers, orthopnea, heart murmur, headache, vague cognitive changes including memory changes, sleep apnea, weakness, pruritus, dizziness, excessive sweating, visual symptoms, weight loss, massive obesity, gastrointestinal bleeding, paresthesias, dyspnea, joint symptoms, epigastric distress, pain and erythema of or toes, or myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, congenital heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, increased erythropoietin production associated with neoplastic, renal or hepatic disorders, androgen or diuretic use, diastolic hypertensi on.) 4. Specific indications for CBC with differential count related to the WBC include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease associated with leukemia, infections or inflammatory processes, suspected bone marrow failure or bone marrow infiltrate, suspected myeloproliferative, myelodysplastic or lymphoproliferative disorder, use of drugs that may cause leukopenia, and immune disorders (e.g., fever, chills, sweats, shock, fatigue, malaise, tachycardia, tachypnea, heart murmur, seizures, alterations of consciousness, meningismus, pain such as headache, abdominal pain, arthralgia, Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo.

Specific indications fo r CBC with differential count related to the WBC include, in addition to those already listed, storage diseases; mucopolysaccharidoses, and use of drugs that cause leukocytosis such as G -CSF o r CM -CSF. 8. Specific indications for CBC related to platelet count include, in addition to those already listed, May -Hegglin syndrome and Wiskott -Aldrich syndrome. Limitations 1. Testing of patients who are asymptomatic, or who do not have a condition that could be expected to result in a hematological abnormality, is screening and is not a covered service. 2. In some circumstances it may be appropriate to perform only a hemoglobin or hematocrit to assess the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. When the ordering provider requests only a hemoglobin or hematocrit, the remaining components of the CBC are not covered. 3. When a blood count is performed for an end -stage renal disease (ESRD) patient, and is billed outside the ESRD rate, documentation of the medical necessity for the blood count must be submitted with the claim. 4. In some patients presenting with certain signs, symptoms or diseases, a single CBC may be appropriate. Repeat testing may not be indicated unless abnormal results are found, or unless there is a change in clinical condition. If repeat testing is performed, a more descriptive diagnosis code (e.g., anemia) should be reported to support medical necessity. However, repeat testing may be indicated where results are normal in patients with conditions where there is a continued risk for the development of hematologic abnormality.

The PTT is most commonly used to quantitate the effect of therapeutic unfractionated heparin and to regulate its dosing. Except during transitions between heparin and warfarin therapy, in general both the PTT and PT are not necessary together to assess the effect of anticoagulation therapy. PT and PTT must be justified separately. 2. A PTT may be used to assess patients with signs or symptoms of hemorrhage or thrombosis. For example: Abnormal bleeding, hemorrhage or hematoma petechiae or other signs o f thrombocytopenia that could be due to Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Swollen extremity with or without prior trauma 3. A PTT may be useful in evaluating patients who have a history of a condition known to be associated with the risk of hemorrhage or thrombosis that is related to the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Such abnormalities may be genetic or acquired. For example: Dysfibrinogenemia Afibrinogenemia (complete) Acute or chronic liver dysfunction or failure, including Wilson's disease Hemophi lia Liver disease and failure Infectious processes Bleeding disorders Disseminated intravascular coagulation Lupus erythematosus or other conditions associated VIII Inhibitor, lupus thrombosis, including the evaluation of hypercoagulable states Clinical conditions associated with nephrosis or renal failure Other acquired and congenital coagulopathies as well as thrombotic states 4. A PTT may be used to assess the risk of thrombosis or hemorrhage in patients who are going to have a medical intervention known to be associated with increased risk of bleeding or thrombosis. An example is as follows: evaluation prior to invasive Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. NCD 190.16 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 49 October 2014 procedures or operations of patients with personal or family history of bleeding or who are on heparin therapy Limitations 1. The PTT is not useful in monitoring the effects of warfarin on a patient's coagulation routinely. However, a PTT may be ordered on a patient being treated with warfarin as heparin therapy is being discontinued. A PTT may also be indicated when the PT is markedly prolonged due to warfarin toxicity. 2. The need to repeat this test is determined by changes in the underlying medical condition and/or the dosing of heparin. 3. Testing prior to any medical intervention associated with a risk of bleeding and thrombosis (other than thrombolytic therapy) will generally be considered medically necessary only where there are signs or symptoms of a bleeding or thrombot ic abnormality or a personal history of bleeding, thrombosis or a condition associated with a coagulopathy. Hospital/clinic -specific policies, protocols, etc., in and of themselves, cannot alone justify coverage.

NCD 190.17 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 50 October 2014 190.17 - Prothrombin Time (PT) Other Names/Abbreviations PT Description Basic plasma coagulation function is readily assessed with a few simple laboratory tests: the Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT), Prothrombin Time (PT), Thrombin Time (TT), or a quantitative fibrinogen determination. The PT test is one in- vitro laboratory test used to assess coagulation. While the PTT assesses the intrinsic limb of the coagulation system, the PT assesses the extrinsic or tissue factor dependent pathway. Both tests also evaluate the common coagulation pathway involving all the reactions that occur after the activation of factor X. Extri nsic pathway factors are produced in the liver and their production is dependent on adequate vitamin K activity. Deficiencies of factors may be related to decreased production or increased consumption of coagulation factors. The PT/INR is most commonly used to measure the effect of warfarin and regulate its dosing. Warfarin blocks the effect of vitamin K on hepatic production of extrinsic pathway factors. A PT is expressed in seconds and/or as an international normalized ratio (INR). The INR is the PT ratio that would result if the WHO re ference thromboplastin was used in performing the test. Current medical information does not clarify the role of laboratory PT testing in patients who are self monitoring. Therefore, the indications for testing apply regardl ess of whether or not the patient is also PT self -testing.

NCD 190.17 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 62 October 2014 Indications 1. A PT may be used to assess patients taking warfarin. The PT is generally not useful in monitoring patients receiving heparin who are not taking warfarin. 2. A PT may be used to assess patients with signs or symptoms of abnormal bleeding or thrombosis. For example: Swollen extremity with or without prior trauma Unexplained bruising Abnormal bleeding, hemorrhage or hematoma Petechiae or other signs of thrombocytopenia that could be due to Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation 3. A PT may be useful in evaluating patients who have a history of a condition known to be associated with the risk of bleeding or thrombosis that is related to the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Such abnormalities may be genetic or acquired. For example: Dysfibrinogenemia Afibrinogenemia (complete) Acute or chronic liver dysfunction or failure, including Wilson's disease and Hemochromatosis Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Congenital and acquired deficiencies of factors II, V, VII, X Vitamin K deficiency Lupus erythematosus Hypercoagulable state Paraproteinemia Lymphoma Amyloidosis Acute Malignant neoplasms poisoni ng Obstructive jaundice Intestinal fistula Malabsorption syndrome Colitis Chronic diarrhea Presence of peripheral venous or arterial thrombosis or pulmonary emboli or myocardial infarction Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. NCD 190.17 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 63 October 2014 Patients with bleeding or clotting tendencies Organ transplantation Presence of circulating coagulation inhibitors 4. A PT may be used to assess the risk of hemorrhage or thrombosis in patients who are going to have a medical intervention known to be associated with increased risk of bleeding or thrombosis. For example: Evaluation prior to invasive procedures or operations of patients with personal history of bleeding or a condition associated with coagulopathy. Prior to the use of thrombolytic medication Limitations 1. When an ESRD patient is tested for PT, testing more frequently than weekly requires documentation of medical necessity, e.g., other than chronic renal failure or renal failure unspecified. 2. The need to repeat this test is determined by changes in the underlying medical condition and/or the dosing of warfarin. In a patient on stable warfarin therapy, it is ordinarily not necessary to repeat testing more than every two to three weeks. When testing is performed to evaluate a patient with signs or symptoms of abnormal bleeding or thrombosis and the initial test result is normal, it is ordinarily not necessary to repeat testing unless there is a change in the patient's medical status. 3. Since the INR is a calculation, it will not be paid in addition to the PT when expressed in seconds, and is considered part of the conventional PT test. 4. Testing prior to any medical intervention associated with a risk of bleeding and thrombosis (other than thrombolytic therapy) will generally be considered medically necessary only where there are signs or symptoms of a bleeding or thrombotic abnormality or a personal history of bleeding, thrombosis or a condition associated with a coagulopathy. Hospital/clinic -specific policies, protocols, etc., in and of themselves, cannot alone justify coverage.

NCD 190.18 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 65 October 2014 190.18 - Serum Iron Studies Description Serum iron studies are useful in the evaluation of disorders of iron metabolism, particularly iron deficiency and iron excess. Iron studies are best performed when the patient is fasting in the morning and has abstained from medications that may influence iron balance. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia. In young children on a milk diet, iron deficiency is often secondary to dietary deficiency. In adults, iron deficiency is usually the result of blood loss and is only occasionally secondary to dietary deficiency or malabsorption. Following major surgery the patient may have iron deficient erythropoietin for months or years if adequate iron replacement has not been given. High doses of supplemental iron may cause the serum iron to be elevated. Serum iron may also be altered in acute and chronic inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) is an indirect measure of transferring , a protein that binds and transports iron. TIBC quantifies transferring by the amount of iron that it can bind. TIBC and transferring are elevated in iron deficiency, and with oral contraceptive use, and during pregnancy. TIBC and transferring may be decreased in malabsorption syndromes or in those affected with chronic diseases. The percent saturation represents the ratio of iron to the TIBC. Assays for ferreting are also useful in assessing iron balance. Low concentrations are associated with iron deficiency and are highly specific. High concentrations are found in hemosiderosis (iron overload without associated tissue injury) and hemochromatosis (iron overload with associated tissue injury). In these conditions the iron is elevated, the TIBC and transferrin are within the reference range or low, and the percent saturation is elevated. Serum ferritin can be useful for both initiating and monitoring treatment for iron overload. Transferrin and ferritin belong to a group of serum proteins known as acute phase reactants, and are increased in response to stressful or inflammatory conditions and also can occur with infection and tissue injury due to surgery, trauma or necrosis. Ferritin and iron/TIBC (or transferrin) are affected by acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, and in patients with these disorders, tests of iron status may be difficult to interpret.

The following presentations are examples that may support the use of these studies for evaluating iron overload: Chronic Hepatitis Diabetes Hyperpigmentation of skin Arthr opathy Cirrhosis Hypopituitarism Impaired porphyrin Heart Sideroblastic anemia Thalassemia major Cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmias and conduction disturbances 2. Follow -up testing may be appropriate to monitor response to therapy, e.g., oral or parenteral iron, ascorbic acid, and erythropoietin. 3. Iron studies may be appropriate in patients after treatment for other nutritional deficiency anemias, such as folate and vitamin B12, because iron deficiency may not be revealed until such a nutritional deficiency is treated. 4. Serum ferritin may be appropriate for monitoring iron status in patients with chronic renal disease with or without dialysis. 5. Serum iron may also be indicated for evaluation of toxic effects of iron and other metals (e.g., nickel, cadmium, aluminum, and lead) whether due to accidental, intentional exposure or metabolic causes. Limitations 1. Iron studies should be used to diagnose and manage iron deficiency or iron overload states. These tests are not to be used solely to assess acute phase reactants where disease management will be unchanged. For example, infections and malignancies are associated with elevations in acute phase reactants such as ferritin, and decreases in serum iro n concentration, but iron studies would only be medically necessary if results of iron studies might alter the management of the primary diagnosis or might warrant direct treatment of an iron disorder or condition. Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. NCD 190.18 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 76 October 2014 2. If a normal serum ferritin level is documented, repeat testing would not ordinarily be medically necessary unless there is a change in the patient's condition, and ferritin assessment is needed for the ongoing management of the patient. For example, a patient presents with new onset insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus and has a serum ferritin level performed for the suspicion of hemochromatosis. If the ferritin level is normal, the repeat ferritin for diabetes mellitus would not be medically necessary. 3. When an End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patient is tested for ferritin, testing more frequently than every three months requires documentation of medical necessity (e.g., other than chronic renal failure or renal failure, unspecified). 4. It is ordinarily not necessary to measure both transferrin and TIBC at the same time because TIBC is an indirect measure of transferrin. When transferrin is ordered as part of the nutritional assessment for evaluating malnutrition, it is not necessary to order other iron studies unless iron deficiency or iron overload is suspected as well. 5. It is not ordinarily necessary to measure either iron/TIBC (or transferrin) and ferritin in initial patient testing. If clinically indicated after evaluation of the initial iron studies, it may be appropriate to perform additional iron studies either on the initial specimen or on a subsequently obtained specimen. After a diagnosis of iron deficiency or iron overload is established, either iron/TIBC (or transferrin) or ferritin may be medically necessary for monitoring, but no t both. 6. It would not ordinarily be considered medically necessary to do a ferritin as a preoperative test except in the presence of anemia or recent autologous blood collections prior to the surgery.

NCD 190.19 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 77 October 2014 190.19 - Collagen Crosslinks, Any Method Description Collagen crosslinks, part of the matrix of bone upon which bone mineral is deposited, are biochemical markers the excretion of which provides a quantitative measurement of bone resorption. Elevated levels of urinary collagen crosslinks indicate elevated bone resorption. Elevated bone resorption contributes to age- related and postmenopausal loss of bone leading to osteoporosis and increased risk of fracture. The collagen crosslinks assay can be performed by immunoassay or by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Collagen crosslink immunoassays measure the pyridinoline crosslinks and associated telopeptides in urine. Bone is constantly undergoing a metabolic process called turnover or remodeling. This includes a degradation process, bone resorption, mediated by the action of osteoclasts, and a building process, bone formation, mediated by the action of osteoblasts. Remodeling is required for the maintenance and overall health of bone and is tightly coupled; that is, resorption and formation must be in balance. In abnormal states of bone remodeling, when resorption exceeds formation, it results in a net los s of bone. The measurement of specific, bone- derived resorption products provides analytical data about the rate of bone resorption. Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and an increased susceptibility to fractures of the hip, spine, and wrist. The term primary osteoporosis is applied where the causal factor in the disease is menopause or aging. The term secondary osteoporosis is applied where the causal factor is something other than menopause or aging, such as long -term administration of glucocorticosteroids, endocrine- related disorders (other than loss of estrogen due to menopause), and certain bone diseases such as cancer of the bone. With respect to quantifying bone resorption, collagen crosslink tests can provide adjunct diagnostic information in concert with bone mass measurements. Bone mass measurements and biochemical markers may have complementary roles to play in assessing effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment. Proper management of osteoporosis patients, who are on long -term therapeutic regimens, may include laboratory testing of biochemical markers of bone turnover, such as collagen crosslinks, that provide a profile of bone turnover responses within week s of therapy. Changes in collagen crosslinks are determined following commencement of antiresorptive therapy. These can be measured over a shorter time interval when compared to bone mass density. If bone resorption is not elevated, repeat test ing is not m edically necessary.

The age when these bone markers can help direct therapy is often pre- Medicare. By the time a fast loser of bone reaches age 65, she will most likely have been stabilized by appropriate therapy or have lost so much bone mass that further testing is useless. Coverage for bone marker assays may be established, however, for younger Medicare beneficiaries and for t hose men and women who might become fast losers because of some other therapy such as glucocorticoids. Safeguards should be incorporated to prevent excessive use of tests in patients for whom they have no clinical relevance. Collagen crosslinks testing is used to: Identify individuals with elevated bone resorption, who have osteoporosis in whom response to treatment is being monitored. Predict response (as assessed by bone mass measurements) to FDA approved antiresorptive therapy in postmenopausal women.

Limitations Because of significant specimen to specimen collagen crosslink physiologic variability (15- 20%), current recommendations for appropriate utilization include: one or two base- line assays from specified urine collections on separate days; followed by a repeat assay about 3 months after starting anti -resorptive therapy; followed by a repeat assay in 12 months after the 3 -month assay; and thereafter not more than annually, unless there is a change in therapy in which circumstance an additional test may be indicated 3 mon ths after the initiation of new therapy. Some collagen crosslink assays may not be appropriate for use in some disorders, according to FDA labeling restrictions.

See 42 CFR410.18, sec. 90 ch.18 Claims Processing Manual for screening benefit description. Limitations Frequent home blood glucose testing by diabetic patients should be encouraged. In stable, non - hospitalized patients unable or unwilling to do home monitoring, it may necessary to m easure quanti tative blood glucose up to 4 times a year . Depending upon patient 's age , type of diabetes , complications, degree of control, and other co- morbid conditions, more frequent testing than 4 times a year may be reasonable and necessary. In patients presenting nonspecific signs, symptoms, or diseases not normally associated with disturbances in glucose metabolism, a single blood glucose test may be medically necessary. Repeat testing may not be indicated unless abnormal results are found or there is a change in clinical condition. If repeat testing is performed, a diagnosis code (e.g., diabetes) should be reported to support medical necessity. However, repeat testing may be indicated where results are normal in patients with conditions of a continuing risk of glucose metabolism abnormality (e.g., monitoring glucocorticoid therapy). ICD-9- CM Codes That Do Not Support Medical Necessity Any ICD -9-CM code not listed in either of the ICD -9-CM covered or non- covered sections. Documentation Requirements The ordering physician must include evidence in the patient's clinical record that an evaluation of history and physical preceded the ordering of glucose testing and that manifestations of abnormal glucose levels were present to warrant the testing.

NCD 190.21 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 87 October 2014 190.21 - Glycated Hemoglobin/Glycated Protein Description The management of diabetes mellitus requires regular determinations of blood glucose levels. Glycated hemoglobin/protein levels are used to assess long -term glucose control in diabetes. Alternative names for these tests include glycated or glycosylated hemoglobin or Hgb, hemoglobin glycated or glycosylated protein, and fructosamine. Glycated hemoglobin (equivalent to hemoglobin A1) refers to total glycosylated hemoglobin present in erythrocytes, usually determined by affinity or ion- exchange chromatographic methodology. Hemoglobin A1c refers to the major component of hemoglobin A1, usually determined by ion- exchange affinity chromatography, immunoassay or agar gel electrophoresis. Fructosamine or glycated protein refers to glycosylated protein present in a serum or plasma sample. Glycated protein refers to measurement of the component of the specific protein that is glycated usually by colorimetric method or affinity chromatography. Glycated hemoglobin in whole blood assesses glycemic control over a period of 4 -8 weeks and appears to be the more appropriate test for monitoring a patient who is capable of maintaining long-term, stable control. Measurement may be medically necessary every 3 months to determine whether a patient's metabolic control has been on average within the target range. More frequent assessments, every 1- 2 months, may be appropriate in the patient whose diabetes regimen has been altered to improve control or in whom evidence is present that intercurr ent events may have altered a previously satisfactory level of control (for example, post - major surgery or as a result of glucocorticoid therapy). Glycated protein in serum/plasma assesses glycemic control over a period of 1- 2 weeks. It may be reasonable and necessary to monitor glycated protein monthly in pregnant diabetic women. Glycated hemoglobin/protein test results may be low, indicating significant, persistent hypoglycemia, in nesidioblastosis or insulinoma, conditions which are accompanied by inappropriate hyperinsulinemia. A below normal test value is helpful in establishing the patient's hypoglycemic state in those conditions.

NCD 190.21 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 89 October 2014 Indications Glycated hemoglobin/protein testing is accepted as medically necessary for management and control of diabetes and to assess hyperglycemia, a history of hyperglycemia or dangerous hypoglycemia. Glycated protein testing may be used in place of glycated hemoglobin in the management of diabetic patients, and is useful in patients with abnormalities of erythrocytes such as hemolytic anemia or hemoglobinopathies. Limitations It is not reasonable and necessary to perform glycated hemoglobin tests more often than every three months on a controlled diabetic patient to determine if the patient's metabolic control has been on average within the target range. It is not reasonable and necessary for these tests to be performed more frequently than once a month for diabetic pregnant women. Testing for uncontrolled type one or two diabetes mellitus may require testing more than four times a year. The above Description Section provides the clinical basis for those situations in which testing more frequently than four times per annum is indicated, and medical necessity documentation must support such testing in excess of the above guidelines. Many analytical methods of glycated hemoglobin show interference from elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin or by variant hemoglobin molecules. When the glycated hemoglobin assay is initially performed in these patients, the laboratory may inform the ordering physician of a possible analytical interference. Alternative testing, including glycated protein, for example, fructosamine, may be indicated for monitoring the degree of glycemic control. It is therefore conceivable that a patient will have both a glycated hemoglobin and glycated protein ordered on the same day. This should be limited to the initial assay of glycated hemoglobin, with subsequent exclusive use of glycated protein. These tests are not considered to be medically necessary for the diagnosis of diabetes.

NCD 190.22 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 90 October 2014 190.22 - Thyroid Testing Description Thyroid function studies are used to delineate the presence or absence of hormonal abnormalities of the thyroid and pituitary glands. These abnormalities may be either primary or secondary and often but not always accompany clinically defined signs and symptoms indicative of thyroid dysfunction. Laboratory evaluation of thyroid function has become more scientifically defined. Tests can be done with increased specificity, thereby reducing the number of tests needed to diagnose and follow treatment of most thyroid disease. Measurements of serum sensitive thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, complemented by determination of thyroid hormone levels [free or total thyroxine (T4) with Triiodothyronine (T3) uptake] are used for diagnosis and follow -up of patients with thyroid disorders. Additional tests may be necessary to evaluate certain complex diagnostic problems or on hospitalized patients, where many circumstances can skew tests results. When a test for total thyroxine (total T4 or T4 radioimmunoassay) or T3 uptake is performed, calculation of the free thyroxine index (FTI) is useful to correct for abnormal results for either total T4 or T3 uptake due to protein binding effects.

NCD 190.23 * October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 98 October 2014 190.23 - Lipids Testing Description Lipoproteins are a class of heterogeneous particles of varying sizes and densities containing lipid and protein. These lipoproteins include cholesterol esters and free cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and A, C, and E apoproteins. Total cholesterol comprises all the cholesterol found in various lipoproteins. Factors that affect blood cholesterol levels include age, sex, body weight, diet, alcohol and tobacco use, exercise, genetic factors, family history, medications, menopausal status, the use of hormone replacement therapy, and chronic disorders such as hypothyroidism, obstructive liver disease, pancreatic disease (including diabetes), and kidney disease. In many individuals, an elevated blood cholesterol level constitutes an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease. Blood levels of total cholesterol and various fractions of cholesterol, especially low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are useful in assessing and monitoring treatment for that risk in patients with cardiovascular and related diseases. Blood levels of the above cholesterol components including triglyceride have been separated into desirable, borderline and high- risk categories by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in their report in 1993. These categories form a useful basis for evaluation and treatment of patients with hyperlipidemia. Therapy to reduce these risk parameters includes diet, exercise and medication, and fat weight loss, which is particularly powerful when combined with diet and exercise.

Special screening for cardiovascular, respiratory, and genitourinary diseases Indications The medical community recognizes lipid testing as appropriate for evaluating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conditions in which lipid testing may be indicated include: Assessment of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease Evaluation of primary dyslipidemia Any form of atherosclerotic disease, or any disease leading to the formation of atherosclerotic disease Diagnostic evaluation of diseases associated with altered lipid metabolism, such as: nephrotic syndrome, pancreatitis, hepatic disease, and hypo and hyperthyroidism Secondary dyslipidemia, including diabetes mellitus, disorders of gastrointestinal absorption, chronic renal failure Signs or symptoms of dyslipidemias, such as skin lesions Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. NCD 190.23 * October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 103 October 2014 As follow -up to the initial screen for coronary heart disease (total cholesterol + HDL cholesterol) when total cholesterol is determined to be high (>240 mg/dL), or borderline- high (200 -240 mg/dL) plus two or more coronary heart disease risk factors, or an HDL cholesterol <35 mg/dL. To monitor the progress of patients on anti -lipid dietary management and pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of elevated blood lipid disorders, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol may be used. Triglycerides may be obtained if this lipid fraction is also elevated or if the patient is put on drugs (for example, thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, estr ogens, glucocorticoids, and tamoxifen) which may raise the triglyceride level. When monitoring long -term anti -lipid dietary or pharmacologic therapy and when following patients with borderline high total or LDL cholesterol levels, it may be reasonable to perform the lipid panel annually. A lipid panel at a yearly interval will usually be adequate while measurement of the serum total cholesterol or a measured LDL should suffice for interim visits if the patient does not have hypertriglyceridemia. Any one component of the panel or a measured LDL may be reasonable and necessary up to six times the first year for monitoring dietary or pharmacologic therapy. More frequent total cholesterol HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride testing may be indicated for marked elevations or for changes to anti -lipid therapy due to inadequate initial patient response to dietary or pharmacologic therapy. The LDL cholesterol or total cholesterol may be measured three times yearly after treatment goals have been achieved. Electrophoretic or other quantitation of lipoproteins may be indicated if the patient has a primary disorder of lipoid metabolism. Effective January 1, 2005, the Medicare law expanded coverage to cardiovascular screening services. Several of the procedures included in this NCD may be covered for screening purposes subject to specified frequencies. See 42 CFR 410.17 and section 100, chapter 18, of the Claims Processing Manual, for a full description of this benefit. Limitations Lipid panel and hepatic panel testing may be used for patients with severe psoriasis which has not responded to conventional therapy and for which the retinoid etretinate has been prescribed and who have developed hyperlipidemia or hepatic toxicity. Specific examples include erythrodermia and generalized pustular type and psoriasis associated with arthritis. Routine screening and prophylactic testing for lipid disorder are not covered by Medicare. While lipid screening may be medically appropriate, Medicare by statute does not pay for it. Lipid testing in asymptomatic individuals is considered to be screening regardless of the presence of other risk factors such as family history, tobacco use, etc. Once a diagnosis is established, one or several specific tests are usually adequate fo r monitoring the course of the disease. Less specific diagnoses (for example, other chest pain) alone do not support medical necessity of these tests. When monitoring long -term anti -lipid dietary or pharmacologic therapy and when following patients with borderline high total or LDL cholesterol levels, it is reasonable to perform the lipid panel annually. A lipid panel at a yearly interval will usually be adequate while measurement of the serum total cholesterol or a measured LDL should suffice for interim visits if the patient does not have hypertriglyceridemia. Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. NCD 190.23 * October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 104 October 2014 Any one component of the panel or a measured LDL may be medically necessary up to six times the first year for monitoring dietary or pharmacologic therapy. More frequent total cholesterol HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride testing may be indicated for marked elevations or for changes to anti -lipid therapy due to inadequate initial patient response to dietary or pharmacologic therapy. The LDL cholesterol or total cholesterol may be measured three times yearly after treatment goals have been achieved. If no dietary or pharmacological therapy is advised, monitoring is not necessary. When evaluating non- specific chronic abnormalities of the liver (for example, elevations of transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, abnormal imaging studies, etc.), a lipid panel would generally not be indicated more than twice per year.

Clinical indications may include individuals on digoxin: With symptoms, signs or electrocardiogram (ECG) suggestive of digoxin toxicity Taking medications that influence absorption, bioavailability, distribution, and/or elimination of digoxin With impaired renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, or thyroid function With pH and/or electrolyte abnormalities With unstable cardiovascular status, including myocarditis Requir ing monitoring of patient compliance Clinical indications may include individuals: Suspected of accidental or intended overdose Who have an acceptable cardiac diagnosis (as listed) and for whom an accurate history of use of digoxin is unobtainable The value of obtaining regular serum digoxin levels is uncertain, but it may be reasonable to check levels once yearly after a steady state is achieved. In addition, it may be reasonable to check the level if: Heart failure status worsens Renal function deteriorat es Additional medications are added that could affect the digoxin level Signs or symptoms of toxicity develop Steady state will be reached in approximately 1 week in patients with normal renal function, although 2 -3 weeks may be needed in patients with renal impairment. After changes in dosages or the addition of a medication that could affect the digoxin level, it is reasonable to check the digoxin level one week after the change or addition. Based on the clinical situation, in cases of digoxin toxicity, t esting may need to be done more than once a week. Digoxin is indicated for the treatment of patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and for reduction of the ventricular response in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Digoxin may a lso be indicated to treat other supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly with heart failure. Limitations This test is not appropriate for patients on digitoxin or treated with digoxin FAB (fragment antigen binding) antibody.

It would however only be medically necessary at treatment decision- making points. In some clinical situations (e.g. adenocarcinoma of the lung, small cell carcinoma of the lung, and some gastrointestinal carcinomas) when a more specific marker is not expressed by the tumor, CEA may be a medically necessary alternative marker for monitoring. Preoperative CEA may also be helpful in determining the post -operative adequacy of surgical resection and subsequent medical management. In general, a single tumor marker will suffice in following patients with colorectal carcinoma or other malignancies that express such tumor markers. In following patients who have had treatment for colorectal carcinoma, ASCO guideline suggests that if resection of liver metastasis would be indicated, it is recommended that post - operative CEA testing be performed every two to three months in patients with initial stage II or stage III disease for at least two years after diagnosis. For patients with metastatic solid tumors which express CEA, CEA may be measured at the start of the treatment and with subsequent treatment cycles to assess the tumor's response to therapy. Limitations Serum CEA determinations are generally not indicated more frequently than once per chemotherapy treatment cycle for patients with metastatic solid tumors which express CEA or every two months post -surgical treatment for patients who have had colorectal carcinoma. However, it may be proper to order the test more frequently in certain situations, for example, Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. NCD 190.26 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 115 October 2014 when there has been a significant change from prior CEA level or a significant change in patient status which could reflect disease progression or recurrence.

Initial declines in CA 125 after initial surgery and/or chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma are also measured by obtaining three serum levels during the first month post treatment to determine the patient's CA 125 half -life, which has significant prognostic implications. The CA 125 levels are again obtained at the completion of chemotherapy as an index of residual disease. Surveillance CA 125 measurements are generally obtained every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and yearly thereafter. CA 125 levels are also an important indicator of a patient's response to therapy in the presence of advanced or recurrent disease. In this setting, CA 125 levels may be obtained prior to each treatment cycle. Limitations These services are not covered for the evaluation of patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of malignancy. The service may be ordered at times necessary to assess either the presence of recurrent disease or the patient's response to treatment with subsequent treatment cycles. The CA 125 is specifically not covered for aiding in the differential diagnosis of patients with a pelvic mass as the sensitivity and specificity of the test is not sufficient.

Three to 6 months after radical prostatectomy, PSA is reported to provide a sensitive indicator of persistent disease. Six months following introduction of antiandrogen therapy, PSA is reported of distinguishing patients with favorable r esponse from those in whom limited response is anticipated. PSA when used in conjunction with other prostate cancer tests, such as digital rectal examination, may assist in the decision- making process for diagnosing prostate cancer. PSA also, serves as a marker in following the progress of most prostate tumors once a diagnosis has been established. This test is also an aid in the management of prostate cancer patients and in detecting metastatic or persistent disease in patients following treatment.

PSA is also a marker used to follow the progress of prostate cancer once a diagnosis has been established, such as detecting metastatic or persistent disease in patients who may require additional treatment. PSA testing may also be useful in the differential diagnosis of men presenting with as yet undiagnosed disseminated metastatic disease.

NCD 190.32 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 127 October 2014 190.32 - Gamma Glutamyl Transferase Other an intracellular enzyme that appears in blood following leakage from cells. Renal tubules, liver, and pancreas contain high amounts, although the measurement of GGT in serum is almost always used for assessment of Hepatobiliary function. Unlike other enzymes which are found in heart, skeletal muscle, and intestinal mucosa as well as liver, the appearance of an elevated level of GGT in serum is almost always the result of liver disease or injury. It is specifically useful to differentiate elevated alkaline phosphatase levels when the source of the alkaline phosphatase increase (bone, liver, or placenta) is unclear. The combination of high alkaline phosphatase and a normal GGT does not, however, rule out liver disease completely. As well as being a very specific marker of Hepatobiliary function, GGT is also a very sensitive marker for hepatocellular damage. Abnormal concentrations typically appear before elevations of other liver enzymes or biliuria are evident. Obstruction of the biliary tract, viral infection (e.g., hepatitis, mononucleosis), metastatic cancer, exposure to hepatotoxins (e.g., organic solvents, drugs, alcohol), and use of drugs that induce microsomal enzymes in the liver (e.g., cimetidine, barbiturates, phenytoin, and carbamazepine) all can cause a moderate to marked increase in GGT serum concentration. In addition, some drugs can cause or exacerbate liver dysfunction (e.g., atorvastatin, troglitazone, and others as noted in FDA Contraindications and Warnings.) GGT is useful for diagnosis of liver disease or injury, exclusion of hepatobiliary involvement related to other diseases, and patient management during the resolution of existing disease or following injury.

If the GGT is the only \"liver\" enzyme abnormally high, it is generally not necessary to pursue further evaluation for liver disease for this specific indication. When used to determine if other abnormal enzyme tests reflect liver abnormality rather than other tissue, it generally is not necessary to repeat a GGT more than one time per week. Because of the extreme sensitivity of GGT as a marker for cytochrome oxidase induction or cell membrane permeability, it is generally not useful in monitoring patients with known liver disease.

NCD 190.33 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 138 October 2014 190.33 - Hepatitis Panel/Acute Hepatitis Panel Description This panel consists of the following tests: Hepatitis A antibody (HAAb), IgM antibody; Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), IgM antibody; Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); and Hepatitis C antibody. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver resulting from viruses, drugs, toxins, and other etiologies. Viral hepatitis can be due to one of at least five different viruses, designated hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Most cases are caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). HAV is the most common cause of hepatitis in children and adolescents in the United States. Prior exposure is indicated by a positive IgG anti -HAV. Acute HAV is diagnosed by IgM anti - HAV, which typically appears within four weeks of exposure, and which disappears within three months of its appearance. IgG anti -HAV is similar in the timing of its appearance, but it persists indefinitely. Its detection indicates prior effective immunization or recovery from infection. Although HAV is spread most commonly by fecal -oral exposure, standard immune globulin may be effective as a prophylaxis. HBV produces three separate antigens (surface, core, and e (envelope) antigens) when it infects the liver, although only hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is included as part of this panel. Following exposure, the body normally responds by producing antibodies to each of these antigens; one of which is included in this panel: hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) -IgM antibody. HBsAg is the earlier marker, appearing in serum four to eight weeks after exposure, and typically disappearing within six months after its appearance. If HBsAg remains detectable for greater than six months, this indicates chronic HBV infection. HBcAb, in the form of both IgG and IgM antibodies, are next to appear in serum, typically becoming detectable two to three months f ollowing exposure. The IgM antibody gradually declines or disappears entirely one to two years following exposure, but the IgG usually remains detectable for life. Because HBsAg is present for a relatively short period and usually displays a low titer, a negative result does not exclude an HBV diagnosis. HBcAb, on the other hand, rises to a much higher titer and remains elevated for a longer period of time, but a positive result is not diagnostic of acute disease, since it may be the result of a prior infec tion. The last marker to appear in the course of a typical infection is HBsAb, which appears in serum four to six months following exposure to infected blood or body fluids; in the U.S., sexual transmission accounts for 30% to 60% of new cases of HBV infec tion. The diagnosis of acute HBV infection is best established by documentation of positive IgM antibody against the core antigen (HBcAb -IgM) and by identification of a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is established primarily by identifying a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and demonstrating positive IgG Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Coding Policy Manual and Change Report This is CMS Logo. NCD 190.33 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 139 October 2014 antibody directed against the core antigen (HBcAb- IgG). Additional tests such as hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), the envelope antigen and antibody, are not included in the hepatitis panel, but may be of importance in assessing the infectivity of patients with HBV. Following completion of a HBV vaccination series, HBsAb alone may be used monthly for up to six months, or until a positive result is obtained, to verify an adequate antibody response. HCV is the most common cause of post -transfusion hepatitis; overall HCV is responsible for 15% to 20% of all cases of acute hepatitis, and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. The test most commonly used to identify HCV measures HCV antibodies, which appear in blood two to four months after infection. False positive HCV results can occur. For example, a patient with a recent yeast infection may produce a false positive anti -HCV result. For this reason, at present positive results usually are confirmed by a more specific technique. Like HBV, HCV is spread exclusively through exposure to infected blood or body fluids. This panel of tests is used for differential diagnosis in a patient with symptoms of liver disease or injury. When the time of exposure or the stage of the disease is not known, a patient with continued symptoms of liver disease despite a completely negative hepatitis panel may need a repeat panel approximately two weeks to two months later to exclude the possibility of hepatitis. Once a diagnosis is established, specific tests can be used to monitor the course of the disease.

NCD 190.34 *October 14 Changes - Red Fu Associates, Ltd. 142 October 2014 190.34 - Fecal Occult Blood Test Description The Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) detects the presence of trace amounts of blood in stool. The procedure is performed by testing one or several small samples of one, two or three different stool specimens. This test may be performed with or without evidence of iron deficiency anemia, which may be related to gastrointestinal blood loss. The range of causes for blood loss include inflammatory causes, including acid- peptic disease, non- disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroenteritis, and colon ulcers. It is also seen with infectious causes, including hookworm, strongyloides, ascariasis, tuberculosis, and blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, and and neoplastic causes include lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma, lipomas, adenocarcinoma and primary and secondary metastases to the GI tract. Drugs such as nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs also cause bleeding. There are extra gastrointestinal causes such as hemoptysis, epistaxis, and oropharyngeal bleeding. Artifactual causes include hematuria, and menstrual bleeding. In addition, there may be other causes such as coagulopathies, gastrostomy tubes or other appliances, factitial causes, and long distance running. Three basic types of fecal hemoglobin assays exist, each directed at a different component of the hemoglobin molecule. 1. Immunoassays recognize antigenic sites on the globin portion and are least affected by diet or proximal gut bleeding, but the antigen may be destroyed by fecal flora. 2. The heme- porphyrin assay measures heme -derived porphyrin and is least influenced by enterocolic metabolism or fecal storage. This assay does not discriminate dietary from endogenous heme. The capacity to detect proximal gut bleeding reduces its specificity for colorectal cancer screening but makes it more useful for evaluating overall GI bleeding in case finding for iron deficiency anemia. 3. The guaiac -based test is the most widely used. It requires the peroxidase activity of an intact heme moiety to be reactive. Positivity rates fall with storage. Fecal hydration such as adding a drop of water increases the test reactivity but also increases false positivity. Of these three tests, the guaiac -based test is the most sensitive for detecting lower bowel bleeding. Because of this sensitivity, it is advisable, when it is used for screening, to defer the guaiac -based test if other studies of the colon are performed prior to the test. Similarly, this test's sensitivity may result in a false positive if the patient has recently ingested meat. Both of these cautions are appropriate when the test is used for screening, but when appropriate indications are present, the test should be done despite its limitat ions.

In patients who are taking non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs and have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding but no other signs, symptoms, or complaints associated with gastrointestinal blood loss, testing for occult blood may generally be appropriate no more than once every three months. When testing is done for the purpose of screening for colorectal cancer in the absence of signs, symptoms, conditions, or complaints associated with gastrointestinal blood loss, report the HCPCS code for colorectal cancer screening; fecal -occult blood test, 1 -3 simultaneous determinations should be used.
