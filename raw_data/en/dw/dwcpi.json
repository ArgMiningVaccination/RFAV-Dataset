In the model, suppliers' costs are private information and investments are noncontractible, precluding cost-reimbursement contracts, requiring fixed-price contracts conditioned on delivery of a successful product. The high failure risk for individual vaccines calls for incentivizing multiple entrants, accomplished by the optimal mechanism, a (+1)-price reverse Vickrey auction with reserve, where is the number of selected entrants. Our analysis determines the optimal number of entrants and required funding level. Based on a distribution of supplier costs estimated from survey data, we simulate the optimal mechanism's performance in scenarios ranging from a small outbreak, causing harm in the millions of dollars, to the Covid-19 pandemic, causing harm in the trillions. We assess which mechanism features contribute most to its optimality. 1. Introduction Outbreaks of infectious diseases can emerge rapidly with little warning. These outbreaks can fizzle out (as with the SARS outbreak), kindle regional epidemics (as with Ebola), or ignite global pandemics (as with Covid-19). When available, vaccines can contain the worst mortality, morbidity, and economic losses from a disease outbreak. For example, Woolsey and Geisbert (2021 ) credit Merck's Ebola vaccine with curbing the 2018-2019 epidemic and subsequent flare ups. Castillo et al. (2021 ) conservatively estimate the social value of Covid-19 vaccines at over $17 trillion. Typically, public organizations subsidize commercial firms to conduct late-stage clinical trials and scale up manufacturing. For example Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, paid Merck $178 million to stockpile 500,000 doses of its Ebola vaccine ( Sagonowsky , 2019 ). In the Covid-19 pandemic, the U.S. government spent $18 billion on six vaccine candidates as part of its Operation Warp Speed program ( Baker et al. , 2020 ). For a variety of reasons\u2014ranging from incentives to free ride on others' vaccination ( Geoffard and Philipson , 1997 ) to the difficulty in extracting revenue from consumers with private information about disease risk ( Kremer and Snyder , 2015 )\u2014the commercial vaccine market is unlikely to supply adequate investment and production without dedicated public support. There is a long history of public support for routine childhood vaccinations in both low-income countries (through UNICEF, Corresponding author at: Department of Economics, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA.

Snyder et al. founded in 1946) and high-income countries (for example, the U.S. Vaccines for Children program, launched in 1994). Public support for epidemic-vaccine development is a more recent idea. Initiatives like the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), created in 2006, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an international nonprofit launched in 2017, provide resources to reduce the cost and risk of early-stage research and development. Many identified diseases of epidemic concern lack a robust mechanism to incentivize pharmaceutical firms to scale-up manufac- turing for their vaccine candidates and bring them through licensure. Without dedicated support for these late-stage activities, few epidemic vaccine candidates advance from the laboratory with the speed, scale, and accessibility required to maximize their social value. For example, Merck's aforementioned Ebola vaccine, effective against the Zaire variant, is ineffective against a Sudan variant currently breaking out in Uganda (Dahir, 2022). Vaccine candidates against the Sudan variant have been developed but none has been stockpiled to facilitate rapid clinical trials and limit spread in an outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a list of other infectious diseases that have epidemic potential but that lack an approved vaccine including lassa fever, MERS, SARS, and Zika (World Health Organization, 2018). Even when global demand spurs development and production, as it did for Covid-19, without formal analysis, it is hard to say the procurement program was optimal. Athey et al. (2020) recommended that Operation Warp Speed spend $70 billion supporting 15-20 Covid-19 vaccine candidates, three times the size of the ultimate program. Our analysis aims to assist public funders in identifying the appropriate level of funding under a wide range of outbreak scenarios and technical landscapes. Suppose, for example, that several vaccine candidates have shown promise in early stages of development. How many should be supported? Should support focus on the single most promising candidate? Or does the notoriously low probability of success in vaccine trials call for supporting several candidates? It may not be efficient to support all potential candidates since the least productive of them may have extremely high costs, and there is a reasonable chance that some vaccine candidates succeed without including every candidate. In a complete-information world, the first best could be easily attained by auditing and reimbursing participating suppliers' development and production costs. Suppliers could be allowed a modest profit margin just sufficient to induce their participation. Perfect information is unattainable, however. In practice, suppliers have considerable discretion in how they operate. Paying suppliers whether or not they succeed may lead them to underperform. Suppliers also have considerable private information regarding their costs. A promise to defray their costs can generate moral hazard, leading suppliers to relax efforts to control costs and perhaps shift expenses from unreimbursed to reimbursed lines of business, inflating measured costs. The variation in this private information can be substantial: from a survey of vaccine suppliers' cost of completing late-stage clinical trials and producing a moderate supply, we will report estimates of a standard deviation of $120 million compared to a mean of about $240 million. In this paper, we propose an optimal funding mechanism for vaccines in a model in which incomplete information precludes funding mechanisms that reimburse development costs regardless of success (called ''push'' funding in the innovation literature). Incomplete information requires alternative, ''pull'' funding, which ties payments to successful delivery of a product.1The mechanism accounts for suppliers' private information about their widely varying productivities. If the social benefit of incentivizing vaccine development and manufacture is high\u2014say because the disease is extremely harmful or poses a danger of spreading to pandemic proportions\u2014the optimal mechanism leans toward inducing multiple suppliers to participate, providing enough redundancy that even if several fail, the probability that at least one succeeds is reasonably high. Drawing in more suppliers inflates program costs for two reasons. First, the participation of multiple suppliers involves redundant investment. Second, the marginal supplier pulled in is less efficient than inframarginal suppliers, increasing the award that has to be paid to all participating suppliers under asymmetric information about supplier costs. Productive inframarginal suppliers receive an information rent that is increasing in the number of participating suppliers. All this expense is worthwhile if the social benefit of a vaccine is high enough. On the other hand, if the social benefit of a vaccine is low, the mechanism adjusts in the opposite direction, inducing the participation of fewer suppliers to economize on program costs. The optimal mechanism has the form of a reverse Vickrey auction with multiple winners. The mechanism determines the number of winners endogenously as the intersection between the ascending schedule of submitted cost bids and a descending reserve-price schedule for which we derive a formula. Winners receive an award equal to the marginal losing supplier's bid or the reserve price for that many winners, whichever is lower. The logic from a standard Vickrey auction, a second-price auction with one winner, is that truthful bidding is ensured by severing the dependence of the award on the winner's bid. That logic extends to a (+ 1)-price Vickrey auction with winners and reserve, which is the optimal mechanism here. We simulate the performance of the mechanism based on a distribution of supplier costs estimated from a survey of firms in the vaccine market collected by CEPI. We assume the early stages of the development pipeline\u2014including pre-clinical laboratory studies, phase-1 clinical trials assessing safety and dosing considerations in a handful of human subjects, and phase-2 clinical trials providing suggestive evidence of efficacy in a small observational study\u2014have had the costs covered by push funding from other sources. We focus on later stages in the development pipeline, which are more costly, estimating lognormal distributions for the cost of conducting the large-scale randomized controlled trials required for pharmaceutical approval (called phase-3 trials) and the cost of manufacturing an adequate vaccine supply to quickly quell a moderate outbreak. Our analysis focuses on incentivizing the emergency development of vaccines at the outset of an epidemic. In this ''just-in-time'' model, speed is of the essence, potentially calling for multiple suppliers to invest in parallel. In an alternative ''just-in-case'' model in which the funder can establish a stockpile of vaccine in advance of an outbreak, a different mechanism may be called for, potentially economizing on expenditure by having suppliers invest sequentially, in ascending order of cost, rather than in parallel. 1Our model can accommodate the less extreme assumption that push funding can be used for some initial milestones, and all available such opportunities have been exploited, leaving remaining milestones to be incentivized with pull funding.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 3C.M. Snyder et al. The simulations provide insight into the number of entrants the mechanism generally selects, the level of program spending, and the net social benefit it generates. We undertake a comparative-statics analysis of how those outcomes vary with the key model parameters including the number of potential vaccine candidates, ; a candidate's probability of success, ; and the social benefit from the vaccine, . We also compare the performance of the mechanism to more or less efficient alternatives. We compare our second-best mechanism to the first-best mechanism that allows the funder to perfectly observe suppliers' costs. To better understand the contribution of various features of our second-best mechanism, we also compare its performance to that of mechanisms shutting down those features one at a time, for example, removing the reserve price, or removing the Vickrey aspect of having the marginal losing bid constrain the award and just relying on the reserve price, or setting an exogenous number of winners in advance. We find that the second-best mechanism can capture an increasing share of available surplus as increases, up to 93% of the surplus captured by the first-best mechanism for the highest values of considered. Shutting down features of the second-best mechanism can severely impair its performance. The implication is that private cost information presents a threat to efficient vaccine procurement in practice as well as in theory, one that can be at least partially overcome with clever mechanism design. The range of social benefits used in the epidemic simulations, between $500 million and $3 billion, are intended to apply to a situation in which a high-income country like the United States seeks enough vaccine to quell a moderate epidemic abroad, such as Ebola. The altruistic benefit of saving morbidity and mortality abroad and the self-interest in eliminating the small chance that the outbreak jumps to the home country and spreads there, substantial as they might be, pales in comparison to the benefit of quelling a global pandemic certain to spread to the home country. The general nature of the mechanism allows it to apply to either a moderate epidemic or global pandemic. Simulations of the mechanism in a pandemic setting have already been undertaken by a companion paper (Snyder et al., 2020), which applies the mechanism derived here to the Covid-19 pandemic. Here, we reprise some of the key simulation results from that paper and compare them to new results for smaller epidemics. Although the mechanism is the same, moving from the moderate-epidemic scenario to the pandemic scenario results in a wholesale change in outcomes. Given the enormous benefit of quelling a pandemic, rather than selecting one or two winners, the mechanism sets such a high award in the pandemic scenario that all available suppliers are nearly always induced to participate. Spending is exorbitant, with awards in the tens of billions of dollars, but this spending is eclipsed by the losses averted in a pandemic. Reassuringly, therefore, the mechanism automatically adapts to the scenario under consideration. In moderate epidemic scenarios, the mechanism economizes on costs, limiting the number of winners; in pandemic scenarios, it reflects the strong intuition that ''all hands on deck'' is optimal. The paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews the related literature. Section 3 provides an informal description of the optimal mechanism, and Section 4 provides formal derivations. Section 5 discusses the estimation of the distribution of supplier costs using data from CEPI's supplier survey. Section 6 uses the estimated distribution to calibrate the performance of the optimal mechanism facing a moderate epidemic. Section 7 provides calibrations for a larger pandemic. Section 8 concludes. An online appendix contains proofs, additional technical details, and supplementary results omitted for space considerations. 2. Related literature Our paper uses results from the operation-research literature on optimal sourcing from multiple unreliable suppliers (Chaturvedi and Mart\u00ednez-de Alb\u00e9niz, 2011). We show that in settings in which, without loss of generality, attention can be restricted to deterministic mechanisms, the optimum is the one we characterize: a (+ 1)-price reverse Vickrey auction with reserve. The operations-research literature borrows heavily from seminal research on auction design (Vickrey, 1961; Myerson, 1981). Our paper contributes to the economic literature on innovation incentives. A series of papers analyzed alternative incentive mechanisms including Scotchmer (1999) on patent renewals, Kremer (1998) and Galasso et al. (2016) on patent buyouts, and Ridley et al. (2006) on priority review vouchers. Chari et al. (2012) and Weyl and Tirole (2012) explore hybrid mechanisms incorporating patents and prizes, optimally trading off rents paid to suppliers versus deadweight loss. Our paper focuses on prizes since patents may be of limited value in vaccine markets. Due to epidemiological externalities (Geoffard and Philipson, 1997) and other market frictions (Kremer and Snyder, 2015), vaccines tend to be procured by governments and central agencies. Prices tend to be set administratively rather than determined by a free market, limiting the market power provided by a patent. In this paper, we remain largely agnostic about whether the prize comes in the form of a lump-sum monetary payment, the grant of a priority review voucher, or is factored into a high price per dose for a target supply. Our goal is to determine the optimal size of the prize and the number of suppliers selected to invest in a risky project. Our analysis echoes some of the broad themes emerging from the economic literature on defense procurement, another setting involving public procurement during a crisis. U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) procurement contracts for new weapons systems tend to bundle the performance of late-stage research and development (R&D) with manufacturing in the same contract owing to frictions in inter-firm technology transfer (Rogerson, 1994), as our model assumes for vaccines. More lucrative procurement terms incentivize more R&D investment, resulting in product improvements ranging from more capable weapons (Rogerson, 1994) to higher-quality prosthetics for veterans (Clemens and Rogers, 2020). Our paper seeks to add specificity to guidance from the literature on the balance between incentives and expenditures.2 2Our mechanism would apply most readily to military procurement during wartime. Much of the DoD's weapons procurement occurs during peacetime, at a leisurely pace that allows the field to be winnowed to typically two developers, limiting rents that need to be paid to the possibly larger number of suppliers that would optimally be called on to invest in a crisis. Rogerson (1994) cites evidence that defense contractors earn about zero economic profits in the long run. In our analysis, the effort to pull in the marginal inefficient supplier can generate large rents for efficient inframarginal suppliers.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 4C.M. Snyder et al. Our paper is part of the literature on innovation in pharmaceutical markets, including the seminal contribution of Acemoglu and Linn (2004) on the contribution of market size to pharmaceutical innovations. We focus on vaccines for several reasons. Vaccines are typically procured by governments, calling for a centralized procurement mechanism such as the one proposed in this paper. The complex facilities involved in vaccine production entail substantially higher capital investment than most other pharmaceuticals. Such capital investments can be a barrier to entry and source of substantial private information. Vaccines' typically low probability of success may call for multiple innovators to ensure at least one success. Determining how many should participate and how much they should be paid is a question for mechanism design. Our paper is related to the literature on advance market commitments (AMCs) proposed to fund vaccines by Kremer and Glennerster (2004) and formally analyzed in Kremer et al. (2022). AMCs commit funds for a subsidy on top of what the end user (say a developing country or a donor on its behalf) pays for a vaccine if and when research and development bear fruit. Our mechanism involves pull funding as does an AMC, and since we can be somewhat agnostic about the form of the prize, could be structured to resemble an AMC. From this broader perspective, our paper nests AMCs as a special case. We contribute to the AMC literature by addressing a number of unresolved issues such as the optimal size of the AMC fund and the optimal number of participating firms. To date, the AMC literature has taken those variables to be exogenous and focused instead on specific design features that lead AMCs to improve on bargaining outcomes without precommitment. Our analysis also provides insights into subtle modifications of the original AMC proposal that might improve its performance. Unlike the original AMC proposal, the fund size is not predetermined in our mechanism but depends on suppliers' announced costs. Our paper does not provide the final word on the best form for pull funding\u2014whether AMCs, prizes, priority-review vouchers, or some other form\u2014a question which can only be settled by considering practical issues outside of our abstract model. AMC proponents could argue that allowing the fund size to be flexible would undermine the program's commitment power, especially concerning for programs targeting technologically-distant innovations taking years to develop. A flexible fund is less concerning in our model in which the vaccine is needed to combat a current epidemic threat. Such a vaccine would have to be technologically close to have any chance of being useful in the current emergency. However, AMCs may have their own practical drawbacks in our setting. Structuring the award to firms as a per-unit subsidy as in an AMCs may generate perverse incentives in that more effective vaccines may quell an epidemic faster, leading fewer vaccines to be sold, reducing the total award. Our paper is closest to a companion paper, Snyder et al. (2020), which applies the optimal mechanism to the case of Covid-19 vaccines. Here, we provide a full derivation of the optimal mechanism sketched in the companion paper's online appendix. We prove that the mechanism is optimal not just in the class of deterministic mechanisms but in the class of stochastic mechanisms. We analyze how much various features of the mechanism contribute to its performance in simulations that selectively omit the features. The analysis of moderate-epidemic scenarios (as opposed to global pandemics) is new in this paper. Section 7 on pandemic scenarios cites simulation results from the companion paper but also provides new simulations for pandemics that are fractions or multiples of the harm of Covid-19. We study how the optimal policy changes when we update variables such as production capacity, vaccine efficacy, and pandemic duration with the benefit of hindsight. A series of papers (Ahuja et al., 2021; Athey et al., 2022) have also sought to construct the optimal portfolio of Covid-19 vaccines as we do in Section 7. Several simplifications allow them to bypass the full mechanism-design approach undertaken here: they assume the program designer has perfect information about supplier heterogeneity yet constrain the program to offer a uniform contract that does not leverage the perfect information. In this paper, we assume the designer knows the distribution of supplier heterogeneity but not private realizations. The contract ultimately offered to auction winners is uniform, but uniformity is required to ensure truthful revelation of private information, not an exogenous contractual restriction. Goodkin-Gold et al. (2023) analyze optimal government subsidies for vaccines sold directly to consumers during an epidemic. Since all fixed costs in vaccine development and production are assumed to have been sunk in their model, the only purpose of a subsidy in that paper is to overcome free-riding on other consumers' vaccination. That paper abstracts from mechanism-design considerations by assuming the funder is perfectly informed about suppliers' homogeneous costs. 3. Description of optimal mechanism This section describes the optimal funding mechanism in intuitive terms and provides an example to fix ideas. More formal derivations are postponed until the subsequent section. For brevity, we refer to the optimal funding mechanism as a -winner Vickrey auction with reserve (abbreviated WVAR, with suggested pronunciation ''waiver''). The WVAR works as follows. Each of potential suppliers submit bid . After unsealing the bids, the funder decides on the number of auction winners, which are eligible to invest and receive an award if the investment proves successful. The award is set according to a ( +1)-price version of a Vickrey auction with reserve price. Specifically, the bids are ordered from smallest to largest. The lowest bidders win the auction. Their award is set equal to the next higher bid (bid + 1) unless this exceeds a reserve price, in which case the award is set to the reserve price, computed as explained below. Sinceis private information, a supplier could always inflate its cost report. The virtue of the Vickrey auction is that it induces truth telling; regardless of how rivals behave, a supplier prefers to report its true cost than any higher or lower cost. A supplier's bid only determines whether it wins; how much it wins depends not on its bid but on losing bids or a pre-specified reserve price. Truthful bidding ensures the supplier wins exactly when this is profitable, i.e., when the award exceeds its cost. For example, suppose there are five potential suppliers with cost draws 100, 150, 275, 330, and 450 in ascending order (all monetary values in this section in millions). This cost schedule is graphed in red in Fig. 1.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 5C.M. Snyder et al. Fig. 1. Illustrating how the funding mechanism works. Notes: Funder-demand curve equivalent to marginal social benefit (1)1from increasing the number of winning firms to . Funder demand is drawn assuming health and economic benefit = $3 billion and success probability = 50% . Reserve-price curve derived from funder demand by applying the transformation in equation Eq. (15). Cost schedule graphs the illustrative cost draws mentioned in the text in size order. Open circle on the intersection between reserve price and costs denotes the outcome from the mechanism. The vertical height of the open circle determines the optimal expected award, denoted , which can be scaled up into the optimal ex post award , paid conditional on success, by multiplying by the reciprocal of the probability of success: = . The mechanism juxtaposes the cost schedule against a demand curve reflecting the funder's willingness to pay for the investment of the marginal supplier when of them are selected as winners. Formally, funder demand equals (1 )1, the product of three factors: the probability (1 )1that none of the 1other suppliers successfully completes their project, the probability that suppliersucceeds, and the benefit from a successful project. Fig. 1 graphs funder demand assuming = 3000 and= 50% as the light grey curve. In a textbook competitive market, the intersection between supply and demand determines equilibrium. Here, because the funder controls market design, it can retain more surplus by implementing a reserve price (a general component of optimal auction design; see Myerson (1981)). The black curve graphs the optimal reserve price in our model based on the formula derived in the next section. This formula factors in both the funder's willingness to pay on the demand side and the supplier cost distribution on the supply side. The reserve price starts out well below demand, but the curves converge as the number of investing suppliers increases. The equilibrium, drawn as an open circle, is the highest point at the intersection between the cost and reserve-price schedules. In this example, the mechanism optimally selects the two lowest-cost suppliers as winners, paying them an award with an expected value of 275, the cost of the next highest bid. The optimal reserve price, represented by the height of the black dot above the open circle, is 321. In this example, the reserve price is not needed to constrain the award; competition among the bidding suppliers proves sufficient. In this example, 275 represents the ex ante expected value of the award, averaged across success and failure. The mechanism we consider conditions payments on successful vaccine supply. To preserve the expected value of the ex ante award in that case, the ex post award needs to be scaled up by the reciprocal of success probability since winners are only paid with probability . Given= 50% in the example, the ex post award would need to be 550, double the ex ante expectation of 275.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 6C.M. Snyder et al. There are several benefits from having the mechanism condition payments on success. Making a payment but getting no results may be a political risk, which the funder can avoid with conditional payments. Conditional payments help deter a ''take the money and run'' strategy, whereby a supplier pockets an up-front payment without making good on the investment commitment, saving itself some or all of the investment expense. Conditional payments can mitigate other moral-hazard and adverse-selection problems. While the model takes the probability of success as exogenous, in richer settings in which it is endogenous, conditional payments can incentivize productive investment decisions and discourage participation of suppliers that are unlikely to succeed. As described, the mechanism procures excess vaccine if multiple auction winners happen to succeed. In the model, one supplier can produce enough to realize the entire benefit , so the output from other successful suppliers is redundant. That might lead one to consider an alternative mechanism that only procures output from one successful supplier. This alternative will not improve on the mechanism as described, however, since the only way to verify that suppliers can successfully produce the target output is to have them produce it; but once suppliers have met the target supply, there are no savings from canceling redundant supplies. If the constraint that the mechanism only procure one supplier's output were imposed on the mechanism, a way to break ties among multiple successful suppliers would need to be devised (e.g., a race or a coin flip). The mechanism would not reduces expenditures relative to the one we propose because the award to the winner of the tie breaker would need to be scaled up by the expected number of successful winners, leaving expected expenditures constant. 4. Derivation of optimal mechanism This section provides a formal derivation of the optimal vaccine procurement mechanism, proving it has the form of a -winner Vickrey auction with reserve (WVAR). The section also derives the formula for the reserve price. We proceed in three steps. First, we lay out a formal model. Next, we state a result due to Chaturvedi and Mart\u00ednez-de Alb\u00e9niz (2011) (hereafter CM), building on Myerson's (1981) seminal work on optimal auction design, characterizing the optimal mechanism for procuring multiple units from multiple suppliers with failure risk. CM's result provides the foundation for our last step, proving the optimality of WVAR in the specific setting of vaccine procurement as a corollary of CM's general characterization. 4.1. Model A risk-neutral funder, labeled player 0, seeks to address a disease with epidemic potential by incentivizing the phase-3 testing of a vaccine and the manufacture of some target number of vaccine courses. Let 0be the present discounted value to the funder of the stream of health and economic benefits from achieving the target vaccine supply via the mechanism. There are several interpretations of . If there would have been no supply in the absence of the funding mechanism, then can be simply interpreted as the gross surplus from attaining the target supply at all. If the target output would have been produced in any event, albeit more slowly, then can be interpreted as the benefit from accelerating supply via the mechanism.3 The funder, lacking the capability to undertake pharmaceutical R&D itself, must induce suppliers to make required investments. Assume a natural number of risk-neutral suppliers, indexed by {1,...,}, have the requisite R&D and manufacturing capability. For a supplier to produce the target supply, it must succeed in two investment stages. In the first stage, it must manufacture the vaccine doses used in phase-3 trials and undertake those trials. If trials prove successful, in the second stage, the supplier must manufacture more of the vaccine to quell the outbreak. Assume for simplicity that these two stages must be undertaken jointly.4 Before investing, each supplier assesses its individual cost 0of taking the vaccine through the combined investment stages. R&D investment is a complex dynamic process involving continuous expenditure that must be discounted according to when it is made and involving the option to terminate if prospects dim (Childs and Triantis, 1999). The firm may only have an imperfect forecast of the costs entailed by a new vaccine. We capture these complexities by assuming is the present discounted value of the payment required to induce supplier to initiate investment. Investment costs may include monetary outlays as well as the opportunity cost of diverting manufacturing facilities from pharmaceuticals under production to this vaccine. Investment costs may include a margin for the cost of financial capital. We model as an independently and identically distributed (iid) draw, having probability density function (pdf) (), cumulative distribution function (cdf) (), and support [0, ], where can be potentially infinite. Supplier observes its draw ; the funder and other suppliers only know the distribution from which was drawn. Using the convention that boldface indicates a vector of variables across suppliers, we have = (1,...,). If supplierinvests, it learns the value of an indicator {0,1}for the success of its combined investment. ''Success'' means that the supplier receives approval for use based on clinical-trial results and manages to set up a facility that produces the target quantity. The vaccine must be effective enough to pass the threshold for approval but need not be perfectly effective.5Assume is an iid draw from a Bernoulli distribution, letting denote the probability of success, = Pr(= 1). Let = (1,...,). 3We do not require to reflect certainty about benefits. When the funder is uncertain about the benefits of a vaccine program, say because the disease's infectivity and severity is not fully known when the vaccine is procured, can represent the expectation of the present discounted value of vaccine benefits. We defer a discussion of how the funder might estimate in practice to the simulation section, for now taking it as a given parameter. 4One justification for this assumption is that manufacturing the supplies needed for the two stages in one batch exploits economies of scale. Another is that contractual frictions prevent unmerged firms from undertaking the stages separately. 5The fact that the benefit is not subscripted by entails that all successful candidates are equal in efficacy and other quality dimensions. Generalizing the model to allow for heterogeneity in vaccine quality would require the optimal mechanism to integrate value-based pricing, left for future work.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 7C.M. Snyder et al. While suppliers are heterogeneous ex post, after making their individual draws from cost and success distributions, suppliers are homogeneous from an ex ante perspective since the distributions are identical and suppliers differ in no other dimensions. Until Section 7, where we extend the model to a global pandemic, we will maintain a model of a moderate epidemic that can be quelled by a modest vaccination campaign. Assume that different vaccine candidates are perfect substitutes and any one of them, if successful, has sufficient capacity to supply the vaccination campaign. In this ''moderate outbreak'' scenario, the funder obtains the same benefit whether one or more than one supplier succeeds. The funder may still want to induce multiple suppliers to invest because individual suppliers can fail when <100% . The participation of more candidates increases the chance that at least one succeeds. The funder enlists the participation of suppliers in a funding mechanism given by the triple ((),(),()), where () = (1(),...,())is a vector of probabilities () [0,1]that suppliers invest; () = (1(),...,())is a vector of ex ante payments () Rto suppliers unconditional on success; and () = (1(),...,())is a vector of ex post payments () Rto suppliers conditional on success. Let () = (1(),...,())denote the vector of expected payments to suppliers, () =() +(). (1) Let0(())denote the funder's expected gross benefit from the mechanism. We have 0(()) ={ 1 =1[1 ()]} . (2) The funder obtains benefit if at least one supplier successfully completes investment, the probability of which is given by the factor in curly braces in Eq. (2).6Assuming the funder does not internalize supplier profit, every dollar that the mechanism transfers from the funder to supplier counts as a dollar of lost funder surplus on net. The funder's expected net surplus, denoted 0()thus equals 0() =0(()) =1(), (3) which serves as the objective function maximized by the mechanism. Supplier 's expected profit is () =() (). 4.2. Foundational result Following Myerson (1981), CM impose a regularity condition on the distribution of agents' private information. Formally, the distribution of isregular if and only if ()()is nondecreasing. As discussed in the online appendix, most common distributions are regular, including the uniform, normal, lognormal, exponential, Weibull, gamma, beta, chi-squared, Student's ,distributions, and power functions. The following result provides the foundation for our optimal mechanism. Proposition 1. Assume the distribution of is regular. Then ((),(),())represents an optimal mechanism in dominant strategy equilibrium if and only if for all it satisfies () =argmax [0,1][ 0() =1()] (5) where () =+() (). (6) Proposition 1 is nearly an exact transcription of CM's Theorem 1, which they derive as a corollary of Myerson (1981). Thus, little further proof is required. The short proof in the online appendix fills in the details needed to bridge the gap between the exact statement of CM's Theorem 1 and the slight restatement here. 4.3. Concrete characterization With Proposition 1 as a foundation, we can proceed to derive a more concrete characterization of the optimal mechanism for vaccine procurement. We will present the derivation of the optimal mechanism restricting investment to be deterministic, specifying an indicator () {0,1}rather than a probability () [0,1]. It turns out that this restriction is without loss of generality since a deterministic mechanism is optimal in the more general class allowing for stochastic investment. Establishing the optimality of stochastic mechanisms is more involved and so is relegated to the online appendix. 6The assumption that the benefit is capped at even if more than one candidate succeeds is reasonable if successful vaccines are highly effective, so there would be little extra benefit from administering multiple candidates to individuals. In any event, this assumption is relaxed in a later section when the benefit is allowed to weakly increase in the number of successes.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 8C.M. Snyder et al. With a deterministic mechanism, suppliers can be divided into winners, i.e., those selected to invest in return for a payment, and losers. Let () = =1()denote the number of winning suppliers. Let ()denote the funder's expected gross benefit when suppliers invest. Then 0(()) =(()), implying () = [1 (1 )] (7) by Eq. (2). Defining the expected gross benefit provided by the marginal supplier as () =() ( 1), we have () =(1 )1. (8) Furthermore, () = =1(), implying that 0(())can be expressed as 0(()) =() =1(). (9) Since0(())depends on ()only via the sufficient statistic (), it is apparent that the term subtracted in objective (4) can be minimized leaving 0()unchanged by selecting the ()lowest-cost suppliers for the winners. To see this, note that () is an increasing function since, by (6), it is the sum of , which is increasing, and ()(), which is nondecreasing when the distribution is regular. To provide notation for the selection of the lowest-cost suppliers, arrange supplier costs in ascending order, [1][2][], using bracketed subscripts to indicate order statistics. Substituting from Eq. (9) and using the insight about the selection of lowest-cost suppliers, objective function (4) can be rewritten solution to Eq. (11) is straightforward. Differentiating Eq. (8) shows that ()is decreasing in . Further,([])is nondecreasing in . Hence, the bracketed terms summed in (11) are decreasing in . The solution involves adding bracketed terms in sequence until they become negative. Hence, () = max{ Eq. (13) embodies the procedure for selecting the number of winning suppliers shown in Fig. 1. The funder demand schedule, drawn as the light blue curve, is given by (). Applying the inverse function 1gives the reserve-price schedule. Eq. (13) states that the optimal number of winning suppliers is given by the intersection of the reserve-price schedule 1(()), drawn as the dark blue curve, and the cost schedule [], drawn as the red curve. It remains to derive a concrete expression for the expected award payment to winning suppliers in Eq. (5). Now (,) = 1 if both<[()+1]and<1((())), while (,) = 0 if either>[()+1]or>1((())). Thus, (,)= min{[()+1],1((()))}. (14) Substituting (14) into (5) yields award () = min{[()+1],1((()))}(15) for winning suppliers and 0 for losing suppliers. Eq. (15) is the payment in a [ () + 1]-price Vickrey auction with reserve price 1((())). This award can be visualized using Fig. 1 as the highest point in the intersection between the reserve-price and supplier-cost schedules. Proposition 2. Suppose the distribution of is regular. The optimal funding mechanism in the vaccine model is a ()-winner Vickrey auction with reserve price 1((())), where(), is determined by Eq. (13). Winners invest in return for expected payment (), the lesser of the reserve price and the marginal losing bid. The mechanism has intuitive appeal. A ( + 1)-price Vickrey auction serves to select winners while inducing suppliers to bid their true costs . The reserve price protects the funder from overpaying if marginal losing bidder ends up with a high cost draw. In the absence of private cost information, the reserve price would be set to (), ensuring the funder does not pay more than the marginal value provided by the marginal winning supplier. In the presence of private cost information, suppliers obtain an information rent, which reducing the reserve price to 1(())helps extract. CM's analysis does not pin down the division of the expected award ()into ex ante ( ()) versus ex post ( ()) payments. To maintain consistency with the assumption motivating our focus on pull versus push funding\u2014namely that moral-hazard andJournal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 9C.M. Snyder et al.

To derive an ex post payment ()from an expected payment (), by Eq. (5), the latter must be scaled up by the reciprocal of the success probability: () = (). 5. Estimating supplier-cost distribution Calculating the optimal number of winners and their award requires information on suppliers' costs for the relevant investment stages. Since calculation is based on taking simulated draws from the distribution of suppliers' costs, we require information on the shape (i.e., mean and variance) of this distribution. 5.1. Previous literature Previous estimates of cost distributions for various stages of pharmaceutical R&D do not directly apply to our context (DiMasi and Grabowski, 2007; DiMasi et al., 2016; Sertkaya et al., 2016; Gouglas et al., 2018). We are aware of no published manufacturing cost estimates for the manufacturing phase. Existing cost estimates for phase-3 trials, with few exceptions (DiMasi et al., 2016; Gouglas et al., 2018), apply to drugs rather than vaccines (DiMasi and Grabowski, 2007; Sertkaya et al., 2016). Some estimates cover only clinical trial management (Sertkaya et al., 2016), not manufacturing, a key component in our context. Other estimates adjust for the risk of project failure (DiMasi and Grabowski, 2007; DiMasi et al., 2016). Since we directly account for failure in our simulations, risk adjusting suppliers' costs in this case would amount to double counting. 5.2. CEPI survey data We provide new estimates of the distribution of the cost of relevant investment stages using proprietary data from a CEPI- sponsored survey first analyzed in Gouglas et al. (2018). This survey of hundreds of firms identified from clinical trial registries has been ongoing since 2017. Firms report costs for all vaccine development stages. Previous work by Gouglas et al. (2018) analyzed a subset of the data covering early stages (preclinical development, phase-1, and phase-2 trials). Our new contribution here is to analyze survey responses for the later stages (phase-3 trials and manufacturing) and use that to estimate the distribution of supplier costs. We assume that the survey respondents were quoting the payment they would need to receive to undertake the specified investment. The reported cost measure includes monetary outlays as well as more nebulous categories such as the opportunity cost of diverting manufacturing facilities from other pharmaceuticals to the candidate vaccine and the cost of capital to finance that investment. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the final sample used in our estimation. The investment costs have distinct distributions. The mean cost for phase-3 trials is $83.1 million and for manufacturing is $164.8 million. That the mean cost of phase-3 trials is much higher than the median suggests its distribution is highly positively skewed, but the relationship between the mean and median of the manufacturing cost suggests it may have the opposite skew. Though the cost of phase-3 trials has a lower mean cost than manufacturing, its standard deviation is much higher. 5.3. Lognormal specification We follow a long economics literature in assuming that costs in each investment stage have a lognormal distribution. It is standard in the economics literature to assume investment costs across suppliers have a lognormal distribution, a two-parameter distribution with scale parameter and shape parameter . Lognormality has been applied in contexts ranging from new drug entry (Ellison and Ellison, 2011) to manufacturing R&D (B\u00f8ler et al., 2015) and has been empirically tested in a cross study of seven industrial sectors across six countries (Lee, 2002). Letdenote supplier 's investment cost in stage {1,2}. In particular, 1is's cost of completing phase-3 trials, and 2is 's cost of manufacturing a target supply. Given that has a lognormal distribution, its pdf is given by Economics 91 (2023) 102795 10C.M. Snyder et al. Table 2 Maximum-likelihood estimates of lognormal cost distributions.

The lognormal distribution's mean and variance 2 can be expressed functions of the scale and shape parameters using standard formulas: = exp( +2 2) (17) 2 (18) We estimate the best-fitting lognormal distribution for the two relevant stages using maximum likelihood.7Table 2 presents the estimates. The resulting shapes of the estimated cost distributions are shown in Fig. 2. The dashed curves for the costs of phase-3 trials and for manufacturing exhibit all of the distinct features of the distributions deduced from the descriptive statistics in Table 1: the cost of phase-3 trials has a lower mean, positive skew, and a wider variance than the manufacturing cost. 5.4. Combining stages Since the model behind the optimal mechanism combines the two investment stages into a single project, the component lognormal cost distributions must be aggregated into one representing their sum. Assume 1and2are independent. There is no general guarantee that the sum of lognormals, whether or not they are independent, is lognormal. Following the argument that the lognormal is an attractive functional form for investment-cost distributions, however, we will impose the lognormal form on the combined cost distribution. A decision remains, however, because there is no single accepted way of approximating a sum of lognormals with a lognormal. We adopt the Fenton (1960) approximation, which Beaulieu et al. (1995) find preforms better than leading alternatives under many circumstances. The Fenton approximation matches the first two moments of the lognormal distribution. For random variables that are independent\u2014as we assume 1and2are\u2014the sum of the means equals the mean of the sum (first moment) and the sum of the variances equals the variance of the sum (second moment). Let and2denote the mean and variance of the combined cost distribution and and 2denote their respective estimates. The Fenton approximation sets = 1+ 2 (19) 2= 2 1+ 2 2. (20) One can combine Eqs. (17)-(20) to obtain estimates of the scale and shape parameters, and , of the lognormal distribution for combined investment as functions of the parameters and , {1,2}, estimated via maximum likelihood for the component cost distributions. We relegate the relevant formulas to the online appendix. Those formulas yield parameter estimates = 5.377and = 0.471for combined costs. By construction, the estimated mean for the combined distribution is = 241.7and = 120.4, as can be seen by substituting the derived moments from Table 2 into Eqs. (19)-(20). All these estimates are measured in units of million dollars. The estimated lognormal distribution of combined costs is drawn as the solid curve in Fig. 2. 7The maximum-likelihood estimates can be computed directly via straightforward formulas. The scale-parameter estimate is simply the mean of the log- transformed cost, = (1) =1ln, and the square of the shape-parameter estimate is its variance, 2 = (1) =1(ln )2, wheredenotes the sample size. We employ a statistical routine to obtain standard errors and log-likelihoods. Maximum-likelihood estimates of lognormal parameters are consistent but biased in small samples, with a negligible bias in samples as large as ours.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 11C.M.

Simulation results for epidemic scenario Having characterized the optimal funding mechanism and empirically estimated the suppliers' cost distribution, it remains to specify three parameters\u2014 ,, and\u2014to simulate performance of the mechanism. Since will vary by context, we will preserve the generality of the analysis by reporting results for a range of from $500 million to $3 billion. We begin with a baseline scenario in which= 5and= 0.5, but later comparative-statics exercises will also analyze a range of values of those parameters. Our embodiment of vaccine benefits and candidate success by given parameters and, respectively, belies the challenge that a funder would face in forecasting those parameters in practice. While challenging, such forecasting is arguably not impossible, leveraging information on transmissibility, severity potential, population density in affected area, and other factors.8As noted in the model section, these parameters need not reflect certain outcomes but can be interpreted as expected values from distributions of uncertain outcomes. For each parameter configuration, we conduct a million simulations. Each simulation draws a random cost for each of the suppliers and feeds those into the optimal WVAR mechanism specified by Proposition 2 for the posited parameters and empirical cost distribution. As indicated in Fig. 1, the WVAR mechanism arrives at the number of winners as the intersection between the cost schedule (suppliers' announced costs arranged in increasing order) and the reserve-price schedule. 6.1. Reserve-price schedule As shown in Section 4.3, the reserve-price schedule equals 1(()). Although1(())does not have a closed-form solution, the online appendix provides details on the use of standard numerical methods to compute it. Fig. 3 graphs the reserve-price schedule that results when the estimated lognormal from Fig. 2 is input for the distribution of supplier costs. The figure shows how the schedule shifts with changes in the parameters. Panel A shows that an increase in from 1000 to 2000 to 3000 holding constant at 0.5 shifts the schedule up. Even the highest of the schedules in the panel converges close to 0 for ten winners. At the assumed probability of success ( = 0.5), there is little social benefit from the tenth winner because the probability of at least one success is almost guaranteed with fewer winners than that. In Panel B, the reserve-price schedule for 8For work on forecasting benefits of a Covid-19 vaccine, see Snyder et al. (2020) for Covid-19 vaccines. We provide further detail on a related forecasting exercise in Section 7. Glennerster et al. (2023) forecast benefits of preparations against pandemics with a wide distribution of potential severities (following a power law) into the distant future.

(2020) for general vaccines.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 12C.M. Snyder et al. Fig. 3. Reserve-price schedule varying and. Notes: Reserve-price schedule, 1(()), using the estimated lognormal from Fig. 2 for the cost distribution. The figure varies and, not, because the reserve-price schedule is independent of . For example, the schedules for = 5are identical to the first five steps of the schedules for = 10 shown. For comparison to previous two figures, reserve prices are expressed as ex ante expected payments. To express as ex post payments, conditional on success, reserve prices must be scaled up by the reciprocal of the probability of success . = 2000 and= 0.9is quite high for one winner because one is enough to generate a high probability of at least one success. The schedule converges rapidly to 0 for more than one winner. Lowering the probability of success from 0.9 to 0.5 to 0.1 pivots the schedule counterclockwise. The schedule for = 0.1is quite flat. It eventually converges to 0, but this is not apparent from these truncated axes. 6.2. Outcome means Table 3 reports a variety of outcome variables in the baseline scenario with = 5and= 0.5. For the lowest reported value of , $500 million, funder net surplus averages $82 million across simulations. Defining the surplus capture rate as funder net surplus as a proportion of , we see that the surplus capture rate averages a mere 16%. The reason for this low capture rate is that the low benefit cannot support too high an award before funder net surplus becomes negative. The resulting low ex post award, averaging $317 million, generates few winners. Indeed, in 14% of simulations, there is no winner, pulling the mean number of winners below 1, to 0.89. With such few winners and uncertain success per winner, the target supply is achieved in only 44% of simulations. For the highest reported value of , $3 billion, funder net surplus averages over $1.9 billion, representing a 65% capture rate. The higher benefit justifies a higher award, averaging $478 million, generating more winners, 2.58 on average. The award is sufficiently high that it essentially zeros out the risk that is foregone because no supplier enters. Indeed, only six of the million simulations generate no winner, which only results when the single-supplier reserve price fails to cover the lowest of five supplier cost draws. The target supply is achieved in 82% of the simulations for = $3 billion, nearly twice as many as for = $500 million. Table 3 provides an indication of which feature of WVAR determines the optimal award. In a majority of simulations, the marginal losing bid determines the award. In roughly a third of the simulations generating a winner, the award is determined by the reserve price. Thus, both features of WVAR matter. The marginal losing bid seems to exert stronger discipline on the award than the reserve price, a finding confirmed below in more formal analysis.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 13C.M.

In simulations with no winner\u2014when the lowest cost draw is not covered by the single-supplier reserve price\u2014the expected award is set equal to that reserve price. Entries in ''no winner'' column reflect a positive number of cases but few enough that they round to zero as a proportion of the million simulations. 6.3. Outcome distributions The focus thus far on means of outcome variables masks the fact that the optimal mechanism does not generate a certain outcome but a distribution of possibilities, including some that are quite disappointing. The realization of a disappointing outcome does not necessarily indicate the mechanism is a failure; it is a natural consequence of the uncertainty in costs and project success. Fig. 4 captures the distribution of outcomes in a series of histograms for various values of . For brevity, the figure focuses on a single, key outcome variable: funder net surplus. The histogram in each panel shows a similar pattern. A mass of simulations generate no net surplus, whether because the mechanism does not select a winner to invest or because the selected winners do not end up being successful. Both events become less likely as increases, evidenced by the shorter bars at zero funder net surplus. As increases, the mechanism selects more winners, increasing the chance of a positive surplus realization. The positive outcomes in each histogram are not massed on a single value but exhibit a distribution. From an ex post perspective, the highest realizations of funder net surplus occur when several suppliers draw low costs, resulting in a low award, but the pool of winning suppliers generates only one success, requiring only one ex post award payment to be made. While such an outcome is fortunate from an ex post perspective, the optimal mechanism from an ex ante perspective invites the possibility of multiple successes as a by-product of the effort to raise the probability of realizing at least one success and obtaining . Lower but still positive realizations of funder net surplus can occur when suppliers draw higher costs or realize more successes. The distribution of positive outcomes shifts right as increases. Part of the rightward shift is an automatic consequence of the funder's obtaining a greater benefit from achieving the target supply, arising even if mechanism terms were not adjusted. But the terms of the mechanism adjust to increase the probability of achieving the target, accounting for part of the rightward shift.9 6.4. Comparative statics The baseline scenario analyzed so far has fixed = 5and= 0.5. Figs. 5 and 6 explore the comparative-static effect of varying those parameters on a selection of outcome variables. Fig. 5 varies the number of suppliers, , from one to 20. Increasing increases funder net surplus. More suppliers exert greater competitive pressure, which the mechanism exploits to lower the award while at the same time increasing the number of winners and the probability of achieving the target supply. The marginal effect of adding a supplier falls with . Starting from one supplier, adding another produces a big jump in outcomes; but when there are 10, the changes from adding 10 more are fairly negligible. Our previous discussion of Table 3 already hinted at the comparative-static effect of an increase in , since that table reported results for various . However, the graphs in Fig. 5 allow for better visualization of the comparative-static effects. We see in the first panel that funder net surplus is increasing and convex in . The convex shape is due to two forces. First, holding constant the terms specified by the mechanism, an increase in scales up benefits but not costs, so the net increases more than proportionately. Second, the mechanism terms do not remain constant as increases but adjust to increase the number of winners and probability of completion, adding further to funder net surplus. Fig. 6 is similar to Fig. 5, displaying the same outcomes in the analogous panels, but varies the success probability rather than the number of suppliers . For ease of comparison, the same curve with the medium tone is maintained in both figures, representing the benchmark scenario of = 5and= 0.5. The mechanism performs poorly for a success probability as low as = 0.05. Funder net surplus is close to zero even for the highest reported value of . The ex post award has to be high since it is scaled by the reciprocal of a probability that is close to zero. Even with high awards, the mechanism rarely generates any winners, and the probability of achieving target supply is close to zero. 9In addition to the spike at zero funder net surplus, the histograms exhibit a spike among positive outcomes. This spike reflects a set of simulations in which the award payment is set by the reserve price for a range of cost draws.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 14C.M. Snyder et al. Fig. 4. Histograms of funder net surplus across simulations. Notes: Histograms for one million simulations for each value of benefit from 500 to 3000 (all results in million $) shown in different panels. Simulations run for baseline case with = 5firms and probability of success = 0.5. At the other extreme is the curve for = 0.95. With investment nearly certain to produce success, there is less need for redundancy. The outcomes from the optimal mechanism bear this out. A modest ex post award is enough to generate one winner, which is what the optimal mechanism selects in nearly all simulations and nearly always results in achieving target supply. In essence, the WVAR reverts into a standard, second-price Vickrey auction with one winner. Looking at values of between the extremes, the increase from = 0.5to= 0.75has a larger effect on funder net surplus than the increase from = 5to= 10 in the previous figure. The effect of on number of winning suppliers in Panel C is nonmonotonic. For very low , the mechanism typically selects no winner. For very high , the mechanism typically selects exactly one winner. The number of winners is greatest for intermediate , high enough to justify selecting some winners, yet not so high that any value of redundancy is eliminated. We conducted additional comparative-statics exercises associated with an enriched specification of costs. We allow for an extra cost of capital, assuming that was not internalized into suppliers reports for the CEPI survey behind our data. We allow suppliers' investments to have social spillovers, which the funder internalizes. We account for the possibility that instead of undertaking a bundled investment, a supplier can wait to learn whether phase-3 trials succeed before sinking the manufacturing cost. For space considerations, details on these enriched cost specifications and a table reporting the associated simulation results are relegated to the online appendix. 6.5. Alternative mechanisms Table 4 compares the outcome from the WVAR mechanism to alternative mechanisms, both more and less efficient. To facilitate easy comparison, the table uses the mean across simulations of the surplus capture rate as its index of performance. Recall the surplus capture rate equals funder net surplus as a proportion of . The first column of results shows the surplus capture rate in the first-best mechanism: the mechanism maximizing funder net surplus when it has complete information about suppliers' costs and can offer discriminatory awards based on this information. The first best can be understood with reference to Fig. 1. The intersection between the suppliers' cost schedule and the funder's demand schedule determines the first-best number of winning suppliers, . The funder pays each winning supplier []an ex postJournal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 15C.M. Snyder et al. Fig. 5. Means of simulation outcomes varying number of suppliers.

The funder's benefit constitutes social benefit; since its payments to suppliers in the first best lead it to internalize social costs, the number of winners maximizing the funder's net surplus should maximize net social surplus. To see this more formally, note funder demand is the schedule (). At thedetermined by the intersection between funder-demand and supplier-cost schedules, ()[], implying that the marginal winning supplier generates weakly greater social benefit than social cost. Further, (+ 1)<[+1], implying that another supplier would add more to social cost than social benefit.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 16C.M. Snyder et al. Fig. 6.

In that panel, curve for = 0.05truncated above an ex post award of $1 billion to preserve legibility of other curves and for consistency with axes in Fig. 5. Table 4 shows that the first-best outperforms WVAR, capturing a higher rate of surplus for all reported all levels of . This is not surprising since WVAR, the second-best mechanism, operates under a private-information constraint absent in the first best. WVAR cannot avoid offering winning suppliers an information rent, lowering funder net surplus. The gap between the first and second best falls in percentage terms as rises. The reason is that the information rent is related to suppliers' cost, which does not scale with , so falls as a percentage of asincreases. At the highest reported value of , the surplus capture rate under WVAR (0.65) is over 90% of the rate under the first best (0.70). The remaining columns in Table 4 report the performance of mechanisms that are impaired in one way or other relative to WVAR, so have a lower rate of surplus capture. Retaining the reserve price but dispensing with the marginal losing bid as a constraint on the award reduces the surplus capture rate. The reduction is more substantial for higher values of . Higher values of are associated with more generous reserve prices and thus depend even more on the competitive pressure provided by the marginal losing bid to restrain the award. This finding is consistent with the result in Table 3 that the marginal losing bid was the effective constraint on the award in a majority of simulations. Next, we consider a mechanism that dispenses with the reserve price but reinserts the marginal losing bid as a constraint on the award. Without a reserve-price schedule, there is no longer a well-defined intersection between it and the supplier-cost schedule determining the optimal number of winners. As a substitute, we analyze different predetermined numbers of winners from one to four.11If the funder guesses well and ends up predetermining a number of winners close to the mean selected by the WVAR, the surplus capture rate can come close to that under WVAR. This is not a foregone conclusion because the ability to flexibly tailor the number of winners to announced costs rather than predetermining the number in principle is a valuable mechanism-design element. While WVAR beats any of the alternative mechanisms predetermining the number of winners, it only beats by one or two 11We stop at four because, without a reserve price to constrain the award, having more than four winners in the baseline scenario with = 5would result in an infinite equilibrium award.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 17C.M. Snyder et al. percentage points mechanisms that predetermine a number of winners close to WVAR's mean across simulations. The main benefit of the reserve price is to prevent the funder from making the wrong choice in predetermining the number of winners. Too many or too few and the surplus capture rate can fall substantially, in some cases becoming negative. For example, when = $500 million, fixing the number of winners at = 4generates surplus capture rate of 1.22, which translates into a mean loss of about $610 million. When = $3 billion, fixing the number of winners at = 1leads to a surplus capture rate of 0.44, substantially lower than 0.65 under WVAR. 7. Pandemic scenario WVAR is a general mechanism for optimally funding vaccines against epidemics ranging from local outbreaks to global pandemics. We have tried to keep the analysis general, but for concreteness have made some choices in the analysis that ended up tailoring it to the case of a moderate outbreak. The benefits of quelling a pandemic would be much higher than the $500 million to $3 billion used for in the simulations in the previous section. Other than making the figures less legible, there would be no difficulty in extending the figures' axes to higher values of . The main difficulty in automatically rescaling the simulations up to pandemic proportions is that the cost functions in Fig. 2 are estimated using data from a survey of the costs of producing a moderate supply. Orders of magnitude more vaccine capacity and output would be needed to combat a pandemic, requiring costs to be rescaled, if not reestimated, to provide realistic values at a pandemic scale. The analysis was further tied to a moderate outbreak via a subtle modeling choice. We assumed that any successful supplier would be able to build sufficient capacity to supply the target quantity on its own. The full benefit is realized as long as one supplier is successful. Multiple successes provide no benefit beyond an increased probability that is realized. The assumption that one supplier can fully satisfy program needs would likely be strained in a pandemic. A campaign to reach herd immunity by vaccinating the majority of a large country's or the world's population would require billions of vaccine courses, not a moderate supply. Successful suppliers beyond the first could contribute their additional capacity to vaccinating more people and more quickly, increasing social benefits compared to one success. This section discusses our contemporaneous work in Snyder et al. (2020) that applied the WVAR mechanism to funding vaccines in the Covid-19 pandemic. We complement that non-technical piece here by providing formal details on extensions to the model to accommodate the possibility that benefits increase in the aggregate capacity of successful suppliers. We outline the steps Snyder et al. (2020) took to estimate the benefit and cost functions, summarize the key simulation results, and contrast those results with the simulation results for a moderate epidemic from the previous section. 7.1. Generalizing model The model from Section 4.1 needs to be generalized slightly to accommodate the case of a pandemic. Let be the capacity constraint for an individual supplier, i.e., the maximum output it can produce over specified period of time, here taken to be the duration of the pandemic. To simplify the analysis, we assume that each successful supplier produces this amount of vaccine. Let()denote the funder's gross surplus from aggregate units of output across suppliers. In effect, the model of Section 4.1 took()to have the specific form () ={ [0,) > .(21) This section generalizes (), allowing it to be any nonnegative, weakly increasing, weakly concave function. The function (), representing the funder's expected gross benefit when suppliers invest, previously given by Eq. (7), becomes () = =1(,, )(), =! !()!(1 )(23) is the binomial probability function, equal to the probability of successes from draws from a Bernoulli distribution with probability of success . Letting0(()) =(()), the analysis proceeds exactly as in Section 4.3. It is immediate that the WVAR mechanism continues to be optimal in this generalized model as well. 7.2. Estimating pandemic benefits and costs To estimate gross benefits from a Covid-19 vaccine at the global level, Snyder et al. (2020) combined estimates of economic output losses and mortality losses for each country in the world. Economic output losses were based on International Monetary Fund (2020) projections of growth decline in countries caused by Covid-19. Mortality losses were based on projections by the Imperial College Covid-19 Response Team of deaths by country (Walker et al., 2020). Each death was translated into 12 years of lost lifeJournal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 18C.M. Snyder et al.

The first row corresponds to results reported in Exhibit 3 of Snyder et al. (2020). The remaining rows are new simulations. Two sets of rows scale Covid-19 harm up or down by factors of five. The last row reestimates Covid-19 harm substituting parameters observed with the benefit of hindsight as described in the text. All rows maintain baseline parameters = 10 and= 0.3from Snyder et al. (2020). (YLLs), the average estimated by Hanlon et al. (2020) accounting for age and comorbidities. A YLL was valued at three times the per-capita GDP in the country in which the life was lost, derived from the WHO's standards for cost-effective health interventions.12 Assuming avoided harm in a country is proportional to vaccination coverage up to complete avoidance at 100% coverage, individual countries can be ordered in terms of harm severity to generate a global demand curve for avoiding Covid-19 harm. Snyder et al. (2020) allowed for heterogeneity within countries in the form of vulnerable populations suffering greater than average harm, but the baseline assumes homogeneity within countries. The authors generated a monthly version of the demand curve for avoided harm by dividing total harm by the duration of the pandemic in months and further assuming this demand declines 5% each month reflecting the possible arrival of a treatment or herd immunity ending the pandemic early. Assuming vaccines provide durable protection over the remainder of the pandemic, monthly demand for avoided harm can be translated into global demand for a vaccine. Vaccine demand constructed in this way declines as the pandemic wanes as fewer months remain during which protection is warranted. Vaccine demand provides the needed schedule of marginal vaccine benefits. Snyder et al. (2020) estimated costs from an updated CEPI survey, targeted to potential Covid-19 vaccine suppliers. Suppliers were asked about the investment costs for late-stage clinical trials and reservation of capacity for large-scale manufacturing as well as production costs. Ex ante investments were assumed to be undertaken at risk (before the candidate is known to be successful in clinical trials) to accelerate the arrival of the vaccine, but production costs are only expended conditional on success. The authors used this survey data to estimate lognormal distributions for investment and production costs for 750 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. The combined investment cost was not far from that estimated in the epidemic scenario in Section 5. The two scenarios diverge regarding production costs. Whereas the epidemic scenario folded the cost of manufacturing the moderate supply into investment costs, production costs are accounted for separately in the pandemic scenario and indeed dominate cost calculations. The mean $13.3 cost per dose scales to a $9.98 billion production cost when multiplied by the 750 million doses a successful firm is assumed to produce. The standard deviation of production costs is quite high at $13.5 per dose, leading to a wide cost distribution, endowing suppliers with considerable private information. 7.3. Results Table 5 reports the mean of selected outcomes from simulations of the optimal mechanism in pandemic scenarios. The first row provides results for a pandemic causing the same harm as estimated for Covid-19 by Snyder et al. (2020) using methods described in the previous subsection. To maintain consistency with the prior literature, we set the number of candidates and probability of success to the values assumed in Snyder et al. (2020), namely = 10 and= 0.3. By design, the first row reprises results from Exhibit 3 of Snyder et al. (2020); the remaining rows report new simulations. Focusing on the first row, the optimal mechanism selects all available firms to invest in virtually all simulations. On average, 9.8 of the ten potential suppliers are selected to invest. The enormous costs of producing at pandemic scale are eclipsed by the vastly higher social benefits. By contrast, in simulations of the baseline epidemic scenario reported in Section 6, even considering the highest reported value of (= $3 billion), only about half the five potential suppliers are selected to invest. The mean ex post award in the first row of Table 5 is $37.7 billion. Why is this award so high? The cost of producing at pandemic scale is enormous. The average cost across suppliers is over $3 billion, but owing to the wide variance in costs, the mean for the highest of ten cost draws rises to over $9 billion. The optimal award is higher still to ensure a much better than even chance that all ten suppliers participate (all ten win in 77% of the first-row simulations and at least nine win in 98% of those simulations). To 12The WHO regards a health intervention as cost effective if the cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) saved is less than three times that country's per-capita GDP (Marseille et al., 2015). Since Hanlon et al.'s (2020) estimate of YLLs already allocates shorter lifespans to people with comorbidities, one YLL was assumed to translate into one DALY without need for further downward adjustment to reflect a proportion of years lived with a disability.Journal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 19C.M. Snyder et al. induce the tenth supplier to participate, its costs would have to be guaranteed to be covered. But since, for incentive purposes, our mechanism only pays ex post, conditional on success, ex ante payments expressions need to be further scaled up by 1= 3.3to translate them into the ex post award that would induce investment. Another factor inflating the program expense is that when all potential suppliers are nearly always selected, the award is nearly always set by the reserve price rather than being disciplined by competition. Mean program expense (computed by summing ex post payments made to all successful suppliers) averages $110 billion for the pandemic scenario in the first row, almost 100 times that for the epidemic scenario with the highest reported in Table 3. However, the mean of net funder surplus for the pandemic scenario in the first row, ($2.8 trillion) is more than a thousand times that for the epidemic scenario with the highest reported ($1.9 billion). The moderate values of in Table 3 were chosen to approximate the value of quelling an emerging epidemic perhaps in a foreign country that may only have a tiny chance of becoming a global concern. The value of quelling an epidemic that has already grown to pandemic proportions easily rises into the trillions, as Table 5 suggests. Subsequent rows in Table 5 show how outcomes from the optimal mechanism change when the harm caused by the pandemic is a fraction or a multiple of the harm forecasted for Covid-19. In these scenarios, the harm computed as discussed in the previous subsection is scaled by a constant incremented by powers of five. Other aspects of the scenario\u2014number of suppliers ( = 10), probability of success ( = 0.3), and distribution of supplier costs\u2014are held constant. Given that almost all suppliers are already selected as winners for Covid-19-level harm, there is hardly room to increase average winners in the scenario with five times the harm. Mean winners does increase (to 9.9) as does number of successes (to 3.0) but hardly noticeably. That slight increase in winners and successes requires a substantial increase in the mean ex post award (rising to $58.6 billion). Moving in the other direction, reducing harm to one fifth estimated for Covid-19, does not change mean winners and successes much either. Even large errors in forecasting harm from a Covid-19-level pandemic would not overturn the conclusion that ''all hands on deck'' is the appropriate response. Even with 0.8% of Covid-19 harm\u2014less than one percent\u2014the optimal mechanism remains substantial, calling for an average of 3.3 winners and 1.0 successes. Not until Covid-19 harm falls to 0.16% of its initial estimate does the optimal mechanism become negligible. Snyder et al. (2020) constructed the Covid-19 scenario using the best information then available; but as vaccines were not yet approved for use, information about production capacity, efficacy in the broad population, and other variables had to be forecast. Here, we rerun the simulations with the benefit of hindsight to see if more accurate forecasts would have changed mechanism outcomes. Focusing on the two WHO-approved suppliers of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer and Moderna) for which good data are available, per-firm capacity was a reported 1.4 billion annual doses in 2021 (UNICEF, 2023). Noting that those vaccines required two doses for a primary course, this translates into per-firm capacity of 700 million annual courses, close to the 750 million annual courses used in original simulation. What the initial simulations missed was that courses of primary series for most Covid-19 vaccines consist not of one but two doses. The hindsight simulation corrects the underestimate of course size, increasing marginal production costs. Another development that initial simulations missed was waning vaccine efficacy against infection over time and against new variants (Wu et al., 2023). Coupled with low vaccination rates, infection efficacy was insufficient to achieve herd immunity that would have obviated masking and social distancing. The hindsight simulation takes the extreme alternative that vaccines contributed nothing to reopening economies, zeroing out economic output gains, retaining only mortality benefits. The hindsight simulation assumes an 86% efficacy against mortality found in a large recent meta-analysis (Wu et al., 2023), not perfectly effective as assumed in Snyder et al. (2020). The hindsight simulation retains the same 5% natural decline in harm assumed in Snyder et al. (2020) as a reasonable approximation to the benefits of the discovery of Paxlovid and other therapeutics during the pandemic and the declining severity of recent variants. The original assumption that the pandemic would end exactly a year after vaccines were introduced turned out to be optimistic. In the hindsight simulation, we extend the duration to two years. The last row of Table 5 incorporates these facts in a revised estimation of Covid-19 harm used in a new set of simulation runs. Zeroing out economic benefits and increasing marginal production cost reduces funder net surplus from the vaccine program. These changes lead the mechanism to opt for fewer winners (mean 9.1) and results in fewer successes (mean 2.7) than in the first row, but only slightly. The higher cost associated with more doses per course increases the ex post award (to a mean of $42.0 billion) despite rejecting the highest cost of the ten suppliers more often. Overall, the hindsight exercise suggests that program design is fairly robust to alternative parameters, reinforcing the insights from scaling Covid-19 harm up or down by large factors. 8. Conclusion In this paper, we derived the optimal funding mechanism for a vaccine against an emergent outbreak. The optimal mechanism, which we dubbed WVAR, is a ( +1)-price reverse Vickrey auction with reserve price. It combines the procurer's internal assessment of the social benefit of the vaccine with suppliers' cost announcements to arrive at the number of suppliers selected to participate and the award that eligible suppliers who are successful should receive. The higher the vaccine benefits, the more eligible participants that are selected by the mechanism, which it induces to participate with a higher award. The higher suppliers' cost draws, the less likely any given number of them have costs below the reserve threshold, leading fewer of them to be selected to participate. We performed two sets of simulations, one set for a model and benefits tailored to a moderate outbreak and another set for a model and benefits tailored to a pandemic like Covid-19. Though the underlying mechanism remained constant, the different inputs into it led to different outcomes. For a moderate outbreak, avoiding excessive expenditures is a key concern, achieved by setting a moderate award that often winnowed out several of the highest-cost suppliers. In pandemic scenarios, with benefits in the trillionsJournal of Health Economics 91 (2023) 102795 20C.M. Snyder et al. not billions, the mechanism induced the participation of virtually every available supplier with little concern for expenditures, confirming the intuition that ''all hands on deck'' is optimal in a global crisis of that scale. In our analysis of alternative mechanisms, we found that WVAR captured an increasing share of first-best surplus the higher the benefit considered. As increases, the relative importance of the asymmetric-information ''overhead'' falls. For example, in calibrations for a moderate epidemic with set to $3 billion, WVAR obtained 90% of net first-best surplus. The design of the optimal mechanism matters: eliminating certain features of WVAR substantially impairs its performance. For example, substantial net surplus is lost if the marginal losing bid is dispensed with as a cap on awards. If the procurer fixes the number of participating firms rather than letting the number be determined endogenously by the intersection of the cost and reserve-price schedules, the performance of the resulting mechanism is mixed. If the procurer somehow manages to guess the number that is correct on average across simulations, the outcome will be close to the optimum. However, without the formulas provided, it may be hard to guess that the correct number of winning bidders averages two when = 0.5,= 5, and= 2000 but rises to three keeping the parameters the same but increasing to 3000. There is no mathematical difficulty in translating between ex ante and ex post formulations of the mechanism award: an expected award ofcan be translated into an ex post payment conditional on success by scaling up by the reciprocal of the candidate's success probability, i.e., =. Economic considerations\u2014the same moral-hazard and adverse-selection concerns that led us to focus on pull rather than push funding from the outset\u2014led us to formulate awards as ex post payments throughout most of the analysis. The mechanism is agnostic as to whether ex post awards are structured as lump-sum payments to all successful suppliers, a lump-sum payment to the first successful supplier (further scaled up to reflect the lower probability of being first on top of being successful), or per-unit payment for a fixed order quantity. A danger of setting the award as a per-dose subsidy is that it may provide perverse incentives in settings outside of the model in which quantity is discretionary. Under those circumstances, a very effective vaccine may end up quickly quelling an epidemic with few doses, penalizing the supplier for efficacy. In such applications, a lump-sum award tied in part to the social value of quelling the epidemic may work better. The mechanism can cover procurement by a single country as well as multilateral procurement such as five finance ministries undertook to increase global coverage of second-generation pneumococcal vaccines (Kremer et al., 2020) or the COVAX mechanism to procure Covid-19 vaccines for participating countries. Our mechanism may have relevance beyond our motivating example of procuring vaccines against emerging epidemics. Our mechanism is most useful for an innovation requiring a substantial capital investment to develop for which there is an urgent social need but limited commercial market. The wedge between the social and commercial value may arise because the innovation is a public good on which consumers free ride or because target consumers are too poor to afford the product on their own. Our mechanism could be relevant treatments such as monoclonal antibodies against emergent epidemics, which are only a short step from vaccines. Whether the mechanism is relevant for these and other products depends on whether they also entail a high failure risk, calling for the participation of multiple candidates, and whether they involve high capital investment, a barrier to entry and source of substantial private information which a funding mechanism must overcome. The mechanism is tailored to procuring emergency countermeasures rather than general innovations. Outside of an emergency, the funder may not need to induce redundant investment, economizing on expenditures by waiting for promising technologies to emerge organically. An epidemic is an obvious emergency in which accelerating the arrival of a vaccine may prevent an explosion of infections. Other examples presenting an urgent social need for innovation include procurement of military innovations in wartime and technologies to mitigate climate change. Our paper should be viewed as a first step toward an optimal mechanism for emergency procurement, not the final word. To make initial progress toward the goal of integrating information about benefits and the distribution of costs to determine the optimal spending and number of selected suppliers, we abstracted from a number of practically relevant features that would have complicated the analysis further. We assumed that the funder and firms have symmetric information about the probability of success, , reducing the dimension of asymmetric information to the single, cost dimension. As is well known (see, e.g., Rochet and Chone\u00e9 (1998)), mechanism design with multidimensional asymmetric information is considerably more complex. Future work could try to leverage the progress Chaturvedi and Mart\u00ednez-de Alb\u00e9niz (2011) made in the special case in which asymmetric information regards cost and reliability, but their results only hold under concavity conditions on , which remain to be verified. Our model assumes all successful vaccine candidates provide the same expected benefit, . Future work could generalize the model to allow vaccine candidates to vary in efficacy or other quality dimensions, likely calling for the optimal mechanism to offer higher rewards for higher efficacy, and calling for even higher powered incentives if efficacy is the firm's endogenous choice. Our analysis has assumed the funder can perfectly commit to the mechanism. Future work can analyze how the optimal mechanism design changes under more limited forms of commitment. As noted by Vickrey (1961), the auctioneer may have an incentive to misreport losing bids, undermining credibility. In the case of a reverse auction relevant here, the funder could lower the procurement price by understating the marginal losing bid. Following Akbarpour and Li (2020), future work could consider replacing the sealed-bid auction, a static form, with a dynamic form involving a descending price, which could eliminate such misreporting incentives, ensuring credibility. We also leave to future work the solution of an even more severe commitment problem arising when the funder is a soverign government, who may renege with impunity on the promise to pay a uniform price to inframarginal bidders and other commitments.
