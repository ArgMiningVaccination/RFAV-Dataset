At times, you will have contact with students whose problems or behaviors will cause you concern, discomfort, or may interfere with your work or the education of other students. These kinds of people or situations do not just disappear, and without intervention you may well be faced with that same situation and that same student again. Certain signals that distressed students give out may go unnoticed for a variety of reasons. And even when we do notice them, it can be very di\u0000icult to intervene. We may feel we are \"in over our heads,\" or we may have competing concerns, such as other students waiting to see us. It is important to know that it is quite likely that the problem will not go away unless there is an intervention. Part of a good intervention requires knowing how to act during these incidents and what resources to call upon. As a faculty or sta member interacting daily with students, you are in an excellent position to recognize behavior changes that characterize the emotionally troubled student. A student's behavior, especially if it is inconsistent with your previous observations, could well constitute a \"cry for help.\" Research suggests that if faculty and sta are equipped with the education and resources to recognize and respond appropriately to students in distress, they can prevent many concerns from escalating into full blown crises and may even be able to help save lives. UCOP's latest mental health resource, a full-text handbook for faculty and sta entitled, Promoting Student Mental Health: A Guide for UC Faculty and Sta, is available to Hastings faculty and sta. Student of Concern Committee The Student of Concern Committee is a multi-disciplinary body of stakeholders from across UC Hastings which receives referrals pertaining to currently registered students of concern, collects additional information, and identi\u0000ies and enacts appropriate strategies for addressing the situation. Purpose The purpose of this team is to provide a means for early intervention of at-risk students through collaboration with campus departments, faculty and sta. Students exhibiting behaviors that are of concern in relation to their personal, physical and emotional well-being should be referred to this team of professionals. Members of the campus community can refer a student to the Student of Concern Committee by contacting: StudentOfConcern@uchastings.edu or by calling 415.565.4701. Related ContentPage not useful?
