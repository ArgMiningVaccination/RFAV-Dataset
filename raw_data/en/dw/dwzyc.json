Schedule: Friday, August 10, 7:00 to 9:30 p.m. We will be introduced to Narrative Medicine and begin the exploration into Native American healing. Saturday, August 11, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. We will continue to explore Native American spirituality and healing practices, as well as the power of traditional stories to hold and transmit wisdom. We will explore the medicine intrinsic in the telling of our own stories and histories for the healing of body, mind, spirit and community. And we will look at the story being lived by our illness, and how our own story has joined and intersected with that of the illness. \"All of our ancestors, no matter where from or how far back, used stories for healing. Every one of us can draw on this past, however distant and however forgotten. An encoded memory of this ancestral past is embedded within our DNA. All who are alive today carry the wisdom of our ancestors within our genetic code.\" Saturday, August 11, 2 to 6 p.m. We will co-construct ceremonial ritual to create the doorway through which we enter our healing. Ceremony is a moment of creation, of experiential healing. Sunday, August 12, 9:30 a.m. We will be introduced to Cherokee bodywork and explore strategies for touch, including deep pressure, rocking, shaking, running energy meridians, mobilization and breathwork. We will consider especially the Cherokee emphasis on breath as a means to restore spirit to all parts of the body. Later on Sunday Weather permitting, workshop participants will have the opportunity to experience a traditional sweat lodge ceremony, gently and masterfully guided by Lewis. Here is a place to sink into the primal elements in a healing circle on the earth.
