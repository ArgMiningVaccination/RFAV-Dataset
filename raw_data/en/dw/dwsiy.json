In addition to applying to the counties in Tier One (Purple) of California's Blueprint for a Safer Economy, the [Limited Stay At Home Order](/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/limited-stay-at-home-order.aspx) shall now also apply in counties subject to the Regional Stay At Home Order, as follows: non-essential retail must cease between 10:00pm PST and 5:00am PST. For counties that trigger this Supplemental Order because they are in a Region subject to the restrictions in the [Regional Stay At Home Order](/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Regional-Stay-at-Home-Order-.aspx), the terms of this Order shall apply at 10:00pm PST on either: (1) day two after this Order is signed, or (2) the same day the terms of the [Regional Stay At Home Order](/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Regional-Stay-at-Home-Order-.aspx) take effect in the county. All other terms in the [Limited Stay At Home Order](/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/limited-stay-at-home-order.aspx) shall remain in effect as stated in that Order. If the Local Health Officer determines measures that are more restrictive than the State's [Limited Stay At Home Order](/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/limited-stay-at-home-order.aspx) are necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 or the occurrence of additional cases in his or her jurisdiction, the Local Health Officer retains the authority to implement such measures. This order is issued pursuant to Health and Safety Code sections authority provided for under the Emergency Services Act; and other applicable law. Erica S.
