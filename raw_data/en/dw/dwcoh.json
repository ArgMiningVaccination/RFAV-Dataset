To provide the student with wide latitude in pursuing their elective interests, the School of Medicine offers approximately 300 elective courses. The elective credit requirements for graduation are outlined in the Student Handbook under [Academic Standards and Requirements](/education/school-of-medicine/md-program/student-handbook/academic-standards-and-requirements) in the lists of graduation requirements for each graduating class. Students receive advice regarding the scheduling of electives during the Student Affairs dean's meetings related to rotation scheduling and residency planning held in the second and third years respectively. Students also obtain guidance from their faculty advisors during their bi-annual meetings about elective selection and from specialty advisor(s) as needed. Specific information about electives including prerequisites can be reviewed in the [elective catalog](https://education.bcm.edu/SOM/ElectiveEnrollment/ElectiveProgram/). A student may not take pathway elective courses concurrently with a clinical core rotation unless written permission is obtained from the clerkship director of the Clinical Core Rotation. The pathway elective cannot interfere with clinical course requirements including adherence to the duty hours policy. If a student enrolls in a pathway concurrent with enrollment in a full-time clinical elective, the student must have the approval of the supervisor of the elective in order to take the seminar. The pathway elective cannot interfere with clinical course requirements including adherence to the duty hours policy. Medical students in the first 18 months of curriculum cannot enroll in any elective which is scheduled to meet at the same time as a another required foundational sciences course for which the student is enrolled. All outstanding grades in electives must be cleared by the end of each academic year. Students who have not completed requirements or withdrawn from the elective at that time will automatically be given a grade of \"fail.\" IMPORTANT: All electives performed away from Baylor College of Medicine must be certified by the Office of the Registrar prior to departure for the away elective. Without such prearrangements the student will not be functioning in the capacity as a Baylor student, will not be covered by Baylor malpractice insurance, and will not receive elective credit towards graduation requirements. These assurances, for malpractice and credit, are part of the AAMC Clinical Uniform Training Agreement. Failure to follow this procedure may result in the adverse action of academic probation against the student for unprofessional behavior. More information can be found on the [Enrollment Procedures](/education/school-medicine/md-program/curriculum/elective-program/enrollment-procedures) page. We strongly advise students who want information regarding elective programs appropriate to eventual specialization to discuss career goals with their faculty advisors and/or a dean in the Office of Student Affairs.
