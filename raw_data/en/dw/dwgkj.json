GnaudschunThis report describes the recent activities of the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces (MPICI), which was found-ed in 1992 and is located in Potsdam-Golm since 1999. TheMPICI currently consists of five departments. The departmenton Biomolecular Systems\" (Peter Seeberger) is temporarilyaccommodated at the FU Berlin until the extension of ourbuilding will be completed. This preface provides a brief introduction to some basic aspects of the science of colloids and interfaces and a sum-mary of the main research topics that are pursued in the dif-ferent departments. The strong interconnections between allresearch activities within the institute will be emphasized. Colloids and interfaces consist of very small or thin structures with linear dimensions between nanometers andmicrometers. On the one hand, the possible structures repre-sent a world of hidden dimensions\". On the other hand, thedynamics and structures of these small entities determinethe behaviour of much larger systems such as organisms. A more systematic understanding of colloids and inter- faces is a prerequisite for many innovations, such as smart\"drug delivery systems and biomaterials. Such a deeperunderstanding can only arise from an interdisciplinaryapproach that combines chemical synthesis and biomimeticmaterials science with physical analysis and characterizationas well as theoretical modelling. The nano- and microstructures that are investigated at the MPICI are built up from special, even smaller molecules,which are using the principle of \"self assembly\" to constructordered structures. The two departments on BiomolecularSystems\" (Peter H. Seeberger) and Colloid Chemistry\"(Markus Antonietti) put a focus of activity onto this \"chem-istry of system design\". The department Biomolecular Systems\" was newly established in 2008 and synthesizes and designs glycans ofwell-defined architecture. These complex macromoleculesare able to specifically recognize and discriminate othermacromolecules such as proteins and antibodies. A long-term goal of this research is to develop novel vaccines basedon such sugar molecules. In the department Colloid Chemistry\", a variety of macromolecules is used to construct mesoscopic compoundsystems and hybrid materials. One important aspect of thisactivity is the molecular encoding of self-assembly and self-organization by specific molecular groups that guide theseprocesses towards a certain target structure. Another recentfocus of the department is the transformation of biomass intocoal using the process of hydrothermal carbonization. Thelatter process could provide an important contribution to car-bon fixation and, thus, to the reduction of CO 2. Additional nanostructures that arise via self-organization are monolayers of organic molecules and multilayers of pos-itively and negatively charged polymers, are suspended at mesoscopic and macroscopicinterfaces and, in this way, become accessible to a widespectrum of imaging and scattering methods. The multilayersof polyelectrolytes can be used to encapsulate a variety ofdifferent molecules and nanoparticles covering applicationsin chemical engineering and pharmacology.Preface 8Nano- and microstructures are built up in a hierarchical fash- ion. Especially impressive examples for this nested\" systemarchitecture are found in mineralized tissues such as bone,teeth, and seashells as well as in plants and their cell walls.These systems are studied in the department Biomaterials\"(Peter Fratzl) using a variety of experimental characterizationmethods. One particularly powerful method is microfocussedsynchrotron radiation, by which one can determine the struc-ture of micrometer domains with atomic resolution anddetermine the structure-function relationships of these natu-ral materials. One important aspect is their extraordinarymechanical properties, which can adapt to changing environ-mental conditions. The activities of the four experimental departments are complemented by theoretical investigations in the depart-ment Theory & Bio-Systems\" (Reinhard Lipowsky). Currentpriorities of this department are molecular machines as wellas bio-membranes and vesicles that are also studied experi-mentally using optical microscopy. The long-term goal ofthese research activities is to elucidate the fundamental prin-ciples and generic mechanisms that govern the self-organi-zation of biomimetic and biological systems in the nano-regime.All research topics that have been mentioned here will bedescribed in more detail in the main body of this report,which is organized according to the five departments of theMPICI. Each department consists of several research groups,each of which will present its research results as obtainedduring the past two years. Apart from its many research activities, the institute also continued its successful higher academic education of young faculty. Indeed, more than 50 former group leaders of the MPICI have now taken up professorships in Germany and abroad. Planning of our extension building has been completed and we expect to move into the new space by the middle of2015 following a significant delay. This extension will resolveour main problem, the shortage of space at the institute, asthe number of staff was continuously rising with the success,for instance measured in larger external funding. I take this opportunity to thank all of my colleagues and associates at the MPICI for their active support during thepast two years. It is also my pleasure to acknowledge thecomprehensive advice that we again obtained from our sci-entific advisory board. Last not least, I am grateful to theDirection board of the Max Planck Society for their continu-ous support of our institute. Peter H.

This was accompaniedby a redistribution of staff, but only by minor changes in sizeas seen in Fig. 1. However, the number of short term employ- ees encountered a step-wise increase paralleling the estab-lishment of the fifth department, and from then re main ed ona stable level. This level is also determined by the availablespace, and this problem will only be solved by 2015 with themove into an extension of the Golm site. As a side note 70%of the institute members are aged below 35, the othersrather-evenly distributed over all ages. With establishment ofthe Biomolecular Systems department in 2009 the number ofgraduate students increased drastically ( Fig. 2), but since 2011 it decreases with the downsizing of the Interface department.The number of postdocs on the other hand has remainedrather stable, as in this respect the Interface department hasnot yet been shrinking. Among the postdocs the fraction offoreigners remains around 85% ( Fig. 3),whereas that among the graduate students is increasing above 50%. Hence theirfraction con cerning all scientists is around 50%. The distribu-tion among regions in the last years remained largely con-stant with about 50% Europeans and a majority from WesternEurope ( Fig. 4).The Institute in Numbers 12Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 4Fig. 30510152025M \u20ac 2010 2011 2012 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 yearinstitutional and external funds institutional external k \u20acdevelopment of third party funds Foreign Research Institutions Industrie / Private Financing Rest of Publicly FinancingEU DFG Volkswagen- and other Foundations BMBFSupranational Organisations (ERC Grants) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 201201.0002.0003.0004.0005.0006.0007.000 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 201250 0100150200250300350400Published Items in Each Year Years1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 201202.0004.0006.00010.00012.00014.00016.00018.00020.000 8.000Citations in Each Year YearsBudget The institutional budget that had developed a step in 2009because of many investments and construction measures toestablish the department \"Biomolecular Systems\" has experi-enced some reduction because of the shrinkage of the Inter-face department in the last two years ( Fig. 5). On the other hand third party funding has increased steadily and mean-while exceeds a fraction of 28%. Among them the fraction ofthe Fe deral Ministry of Education and Technology (BMBF) andof the German Science Foundation (DFG) have remained on ahigh level, and the major increase results from European con-tributions, especially from the European Research Council( Fig. 6). This is important to note, as the high level of funding thus does not impede the mission of the institute: basic sci-ence. On the contrary, most of third party funding stems frombasic science funding agencies (DFG, ERC, VW foundation)and therefore supports directly the institute`s mission. Be -cause the institute does not want and is not allowed to per-form contractual research for industry, their contribution isbelow 2% of the budget, which is rather low and stable. Thisis de sirable for an institute with a basic science mission.Scientific Results and ImpactAlthough being a research institute and no university we con-sider the most important result not paper but well-trainedyoung scientists. Annually more than five scientists leave theinstitute on professor positions or equivalent ones, 25-30 PhDstudents finish their theses and about 50 Postdocs leave onnew positions. The number of publications has arrived at amaximum value around 350 ( Fig. 7a) and now slightly de cays because of the downsizing of the interface department. This isa good but not an overwhelming number for an institute thatclaims to be world-top. Overwhelming, however is the numberof annual citations of around 20.000 ( Fig. 7b) with which the institute need not fear a comparison with any unit of compa-rable size world-wide. This is in addition remarkable for arather young institute since citations are also based on reputa -tion, and this increases with age. These numbers are ba sicallythe reason that scientists win highly competitive awards andprojects and that the institute is top-seeded in rankings likethose of the Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation. jungen Institut ist zudem an der International GraduateResearch and Training Group \"Self Assembled Soft Nanostruc-tures at Interfaces\", koordiniert von (BSRT), koordiniert von Charit\u00e9 Univer-sit\u00e4tsmedizin Seeberger 1617The Research Program Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces (MPICI) Colloids are small building blocks which constitute the basic units of living organisms and of many useful materials. Mas-tering their synthesis and assembly will solve pressing prob-lems in health, energy, transport and many other importantareas. The research strategy of the MPICI is to address fun-damental scientific problems relating to colloids and to theinterfaces between them. Thus the scientific vision of theinstitute is to lead the effort in making, visualizing, measur-ing and understanding these organic and inorganic nano-scale building blocks, as well as their interaction and assem-bly ( see Fig. 1). This is guiding our basic scientific research related to biological or medical questions, as well as tomaterials for various applications. Bioinspired materialsresearch is bridging between the two directions by translat-ing materials structures found in nature into concepts forengineering materials. To achieve these goals, we are convinced that scientific excellence must be combined with an exceptional commit-ment to mentoring and supporting young scientists. Thus, our mission statement is: Bridging the gap between molecules and multiscale materials and biosystems through excellence in science and in the support ofyoung researchers. Over the last years the MPI of Colloids and Interfaces has attained a leadership position in several cutting edge research areas within the field of colloids and interfaces. These areas - ordered from smaller to increasingly larger objects - include the synthesis, characterization and theo -retical description of oligosaccharidesand carbohydrates, of functionalizednanoparticles polysaccharides, proteins or mineral-ized tissues such as bone and teeth. In all ofthese areas, the name of the MPICI serves as atrademark. The MPICI pursues two general strategies in order to keep and strengthen its leading role in the field: (i) The MPI-CI constantly identifies and selects new interdisciplinaryresearch topics with the highest potential impact on scienceand society; and (ii) the MPICI is very active in the training ofgraduate students and the support of young scientists and,thus, continues to be a hotbed for academic careers. Recently, several new topics related to biomimetic and biological systems have been taken up. Four new focus areasare: molecular recognition of carbohydrates, photo-inducedmolecular processes, transport processes based on molecu-lar motors, and biomimetic actuation and motility. Theseareas will also be pursued in the framework of the new Inter-national Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) on \"MultiscaleBiosystems: From molecular recognition to mesoscopictrans-port\" during its first funding period from 2013 to 2019. An improved understanding of multiscale biosystems provides the knowledge base for many possible applicationssuch as the development of intelligent drug carriers and bio-materials. Interdisciplinary Expertise The complex and versatile world of colloids and interfacesprovides many levels of spatial and temporal organization,from molecular to mesoscopic scales. In order to addressthese multiscale systems and processes, the departments atthe MPICI provide complementary methodology and coreexpertise from chemistry, physics, science. Thedepartments of \"Biomolecular (Seeberger) and\"Colloid Chemistry\" (Antonietti) have their expertise synthesis of molecules and materials. Thedepartments of \"Biomaterials\" (Fratzl) and \"Interfaces\" (M\u00f6hwald) focus on structural analysis and physical charac-terization. The department of \"Theory & Bio-Systems\"(Lipowsky) provides expertise in theory and modeling. Duringthe last decade, the MPICI has strongly enhanced its activi-ties on biosystems by establishing the Fratzl department on\"Bio materials\" in 2003 and the on Modelling Theorcal predic onMaterials Medicine Make Visualize Measure Understand Organic and inorganic nano-scale building blocks as well as their interac ons and assemblyColloid Chemistry Interfaces Theory and materials mulscale pa erns av e ma t e r ia ls interface designBioinspired materials researchS N O I T A C I L P P A H C A O R P P A GOALS RESEARCH AREAS DEPTSmolecular motors so maer Fig. 1: Scientific strategy of the MPICI\"Biomolecular Systems\" in 2009. In order to strengthen its core expertise on structur-al analysis and physical characterizationafter the retirement of Helmuth M\u00f6hwald in2014, the MPICI will immediately establish an inde-pendent research group (W2 professor level) in this area. Thesearch for an outstanding scientist to lead this group is underway. Moreover, the MPICI strives to establish a fifth depart-ment in the future to cover this area. Long-term Objectives Each department of the MPICI pursues challenging long-termobjectives. The Seeberger department characterizes the com-plex mixture of carbohydrates in the glycocalix of eukaryoticand prokaryotic cells in order to develop carbohydrate basedvaccines. The Antonietti department wants to establishenzyme-like nanocatalysts and artificial photosynthesis asmilestones for green energy production. The M\u00f6hwalddepartment has been focusing on molecular and supramolec-ular interactions at interfaces. The Fratzl department wantsto understand and mimic plant motility and bone tissuegrowth. The Lipowsky department wants to understand andcharacterize the complexity gap between artificial and natu-ral biosystems. New Focus Areas During the last years , as mentioned above, four new promis-ing focus areas have appeared. These shall be describedbelow in more detail, also to visualize the links between thedepartments. Molecular recognition of carbohydrates is afocus area of the Seeberger department, with overlappinginterests of the Antonietti, M\u00f6hwald, and Lipowsky depart-ments. Research in this core area is based on the synthesisof polysaccharides and carbohydrates with a well-definedmolecular architecture (Dept. Seeberger). These carbohy-drates are then anchored to nanoparticles (Dept. Antonietti), lipid monolayers (Dept. M\u00f6hwald), and lipid bilayers (Dept. Lipowsky). In this way, they become amenable to experimental and computational methods that probe these systems with high spatial and temporal resolution. Photo-induced molecular processes are a focus area of the Antonietti department, with overlapping interests of the Seeberger, M\u00f6h- wald and Lipowsky departments. The main challenge for the photo-induced cleavage of water is to find appropriate catalysts. A new type of catalyst based on a synthetic polymer has been recently introduced and will be fur- ther developed and optimized (Dept. Antonietti). Other photo-induced processes include the synthesis of poly-mers using radical generation (Dept. Seeberger,Dept. changes of supramolecular assemblies (Dept.Lipowsky). Cargo transport by molecular motors is a focusarea of the Lipowsky department, with overlapping interestsof the Fratzl and M\u00f6hwald departments. Intracellular cargoparticles exhibit complex patterns of transport reflecting thecooperative activity of molecular motor teams (Dept.Lipowsky). These motors can transport synthetic multilayercapsules filled with peptides and other chemical agents(Dept. M\u00f6hwald). One intriguing process for which the role ofactive transport remains to be elucidated is the assembly ofmagnetosomes in magnetotactic bacteria (Dept. Fratzl, Dept.Lipowsky). Biomimetic actuation and growth of tissues is afocus area of the Fratzl department, with overlapping inter-ests of the Lipowsky department. Shape changes in tissuesare caused by the generation of non-uniform, internal stress-es. These stresses are generated by water absorption in thecell walls of plant tissues and by cell proliferation in bone orskin tissues (Dept. Fratzl). The ongoing experimental studiesof these stress-generating processes will also be addressedby multi-scale computer simulations in order to elucidate theunderlying molecular mechanisms (Dept. Lipowsky). Graduate Programs The MPICI will continue its strong engagement in the train-ing of graduate students. The first International Max PlanckResearch School (IMPRS) on \"Biomimetic Systems\" has nowbeen successfully operated for twelve years and will end infall 2012. The second IMPRS on \"Multiscale Biosystems\" hasbeen recently approved for the first funding period from 2013until 2019. The main objective of the IMPRS curriculum is toenable the participating doctoral students to work on theirresearch projects, which are at the forefront of currentresearch, in an efficient and fruitful manner. In order to par-ticipate in the interdisciplinary research area of multiscalebiosystems, doctoral students must learn the different lan-guages as used in these different disciplines and need tounderstand how to extract useful information from the vastscientific literature that is published in these disciplines. The 18 training will also be useful for doctoral students, who intend to pursue a career outside academia in pharmacology, bio-engineering, and medicine. In addition the institute is activein the International Graduate research and Training Group on\"Self Assembled Soft Nanostructures at Interfaces\" coordi-nated by TU Berlin. The MPICI is also engaged in two othergraduate schools which emerged from the excellence initia-tive of the German Science Foundation (DFG): the \"Berlin-Brandenburg School of Regenerative Therapies\" (coordinatedby Berlin) AnalyticalSciences Adlershof\" (coordinated by the Humboldt UniversityBerlin). Support of Young Scientists The MPICI will continue to be a hotbed for young scientistswho pursue a career in academia. A large number of formerassociates and postdocs are now professors at German orforeign universities. In particular, during the last ten years, 33former research group leaders of the MPICI have taken upoffers for professorships that are equivalent to German W3or W2 positions. Most of these research group leaders wereteaching in the framework of the old IMPRS on \"BiomimeticSystems\". In the new IMPRS on \"Multiscale Biosystems\", allresearch group leaders, who work on topics related to theschool, will be members of the school's associate faculty andwill also take part in the recruitment and admission of thestudents. Potential Applications and Impact on Society as a Whole Many research activities at the MPICI have applications thatwill be useful and beneficial for research in other disciplinesand for society as a whole. The development of vac-cines based on hydrocarbons in connectionwith the possibility to produce largeamounts of these moleculesrepresents a very promis-ing route for theprevention ofmanytropical diseases such as malaria or leishmaniasis. These vac-cines would be particularly beneficial for developing coun-tries. Functionalized nanoparticles and materials can be usedfor improved photoinduced cleavage of water and for newmethods of CO 2fixation. Likewise, these systems have a wide range of applications in the context of smart drug deliv-ery systems, which combine molecular recognition and acti-vation with triggered drug release. Self-repairing coatingsmay lead to less materials consumption by avoiding corrosionand biofouling. The biosystems studied at the MPICI are alsolikely to lead to new materials concepts based on bio-inspired designs as well as new concepts for material-sup-ported organ regeneration. Finally, the society as a wholewill strongly benefit from the many young scientists thathave received a broad interdisciplinary training at the MPICIand leave the institute in order to apply their knowledge inother branches of science and engineering.

All fivedirectors hold Honorary Professorships at the University Pots- dam which reflect intensive teaching in basic studies as wellas in specialized subjects. In addition to this Prof. Fratzl andProf. Lipowsky hold Honorary Professorships at the HumboldtUniversity Berlin and Prof. Seeberger at the Free UniversityBerlin. In 2005 Prof. Rabe of the Humboldt University Berlin(Institute of Physics) was appointed as Foreign Member ofthe Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces. In order to support and enhance its activities on bio- mimetic systems, and to improve the training of young re -searchers in this emerging field, the MPICI had created theInternational Max-Planck Research School (IMPRS) on Bio-mimetic Systems, followed by the new International MaxPlanck Research School (IMPRS) on \"Multiscale Biosystems\"starting in July 2013. The school is supported by the MaxPlanck Society and the partner universities, which are allBerlin Universities and the University Potsdam. The programlasts at least six years but it can be extended up to twelveyears, can take on up to 20 students every year and leads toa doctor's degree in physics, chemistry or biology. For additional intensification of the collaboration two Junior Professorships were established at the UniversityPotsdam: Prof. Matias Bargheer (Department of Interfaces)and Prof. Andreas Taubert (Department of Colloid Chemistrywho meanwhile were appointed as W3 professors at the Uni-versity Potsdam (UP). The cooperation with the institute willthus go on. The institute is also involved in the Cluster of Excellence \"Unifying Concepts in Catalysis\", which is co-ordinated bythe Technical University Berlin. Since 2009 Prof. Antoniettihas been principal investigator (PI) there. It was founded in2007 within the framework of the Excellence Initiative launch -ed by the German Federal and State Governments. Further-more the MPICI cooperates in the new SFB program \"Muscu-loskeletal Regenaration\" (co-ordinated by Charit\u00e9, MedicalUniversity, Berlin) and the by the FU coordinated SFB 765\"Multivalent Display\" with the Free University Berlin and theInstitute of Polymer Research at the Helmholtz-ZentrumGeesthacht. It is also a member of the BMBF financed Berlin-Bran- denburg Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT) and theBerlin-Brandenburg School of Regenerative Therapies (BSRT), funded by the Excellence Initiative of the DFG. On top of thisProf. Fratzl co-ordinates the DFG priority SPP 1420\"Biomimetic Materials Research\", in which more than tenuniversities as well as Max Planck Institutes take part. Theaim is to explore the possibility of generating new materialclasses of great potential by combining the degrees of free-dom of hierarchical structuring inspired by nature with thevariety of materials offered by engineering. In addition a platform for investigating biological speci- mens at Synchrotrons is set up together with the UniversityHeidelberg and is run by the Helmholtz Centre Berlin forMaterials and Energy. Big engagement required also themaintenance and build-up of beam-lines at the neutron- andsynchrotron radiation sources in Berlin and the German elec- tron synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg. Since 2009 the institute also co-operates in the project \"The Lab in a Hankie\" - Impulse Centre for Integrated Bio-analysis with the Fraunhofer Institute of Biomedical Engeneer-ing IBMT, the University Potsdam and others. The project aimsat the development of new biosensors for the direct detectionof pathogens without complicated purification steps. Beyondthat it took part in the systems biology network GoFORSYS,which was funded by the BMBF and the international graduateprogram \"Self-assembled Soft Matter Nanostructures\", to -geth er with the Berlin universities, which is funded by the DFG. International Co-operations Within the framework of European programs in total thereare 21 EU projects within 7th framework program, includingtwo ERC Advanced Grants. Furthermore the Institute is principal partner together with the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology inDortmund and the Riken Advanced Science Institute (ASI) inWako of the new Riken Max Planck Joint Research Center.The new research center is able to promote the more effec-tive use of research resources as well as information andtechnology in the field of systems chemical biology.

The IMPRS on Biomimetic Systems offered,together its partner groups, an interdisciplinary curricu-lum on 'Biomimetic Systems' for foreign and German stu-dents from physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science.One major goal of this curriculum was to provide a commonbasis of knowledge in biological and biomimetic systems,which transcends the traditional boundaries between the dif-ferent disciplines. The curriculum was based on courses,seminars and workshops with the participation of scientists,who work at the cutting edge of this field. The IMPRS on Biomimetic Systems was running for twelve years until October 2012. The curriculum delivered by the IMPRS on Biomime- tic SystemsThe curriculum of the IMPRS on Biomimetic Systems wasbased on semester courses, lab and compact courses, as wellas seminars. The semester courses delivered general andfundamental background information to unify the knowledgeamong scientists from different disciplines. The lab and com-pact courses were intended to provide lectures on moreadvanced topics. The courses of the IMPRS were held in English and open to all students of the participating institutions. As the firstgraduate school in the Potsdam area, the IMPRS contributedto the training of local doctoral students. Starting with the winter semester 2001/2002 and until the winter semester 2010/2011, the following courses havebeen offered: \u00b7 79 Semester Courses, with a total duration of about 2,200 hours of lectures. Junior group leaders held more than 1/3 of these lectures \u00b7 44 Compact and Lab Courses, with a total duration of more than 600 hours of lectures About half of the lectures have been delivered by group lead-ers and about one quarter by invited guest scientists. In addition, the IMPRS on Biomimetic Systems was part of a large international research training network funded by the European Commission (EST on \"Biomimetic Systems\")and another European network (STREP on \"Active Bio-Sys-tems\"), both coordinated by R. Lipowsky. Together with thesetwo networks, one international conference and five work-shops have been organized. Furthermore, the IMPRS alsoorganized a summer school together with the Chinese Acad-emy of Sciences, which was held in Beijing, and actively sup-ported the conference PhysCell2009. The IMPRS on Bio-mimetic Systems was participating in the BMBF funded Sys-tems Biology project GoFORSYS as well as in the PotsdamAssociation of all graduate schools (PoGS), and offered sev- eral courses shared with the MSc in Physics and Biology atthe University of Potsdam.IMPRS on Multiscale BiosystemsIn collaboration with the University of Potsdam, the Free University Berlin, the Humboldt University Berlin, and theFraunhofer Institute for Biomedical Engineering IBMT, theMPICI now offers a new IMPRS on \"Multiscale Biosystems\".The speaker of the school is R. Lipowsky, the vice-speaker is R. Seckler, and the coordinator is A. Valleriani. The newIMPRS will start its training activities in the winter semester2013/2014. Our new school addresses the fundamental levels of biosystems as provided by macromolecules in aqueous solu-tions, molecular recognition between these building blocks,free energy transduction by molecular machines as well asstructure formation and transport in cells and tissues. Theresearch activities are focused on four core areas: molecularrecognition of carbohydrates, interaction of biomoleculeswith light, directed intracellular process-es as well as directed shape changesof tissues. One general objective isto under stand, in a quantitativemanner, how the processes onsupramolecular and mesoscopicscales between a few nanometersand many micrometers arise fromthe structure and dynamics of themolecular building blocks. General Framework The English-speaking doctoral pro-gram offers cutting edge and inter-disciplinary research and has beenapproved for six years, with a pos-sible extension for another sixyears. Headquarter of the school isthe MPICI. In line with the generalrules for all IMPRS, about half of theadmitted students will be from Germanyand from abroad, respectively. The interdisciplinary researchcombines bottom-up with top-down approaches, which arepursued by several groups from theoretical and experimentalbiophysics, from physical and colloid chemistry as well asfrom biochemistry and molecular biology. Furthermore, a vari-ety of soft skills events will be offered, including German lan-guage courses as well as lectures on career possibilities. Group leaders, junior group leaders and professors of the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, the PotsdamUniversity, FU Berlin, HU Berlin, and the Fraunhofer Institutefor Biomedical Engineering IBMT participate in the programand offer training and mentorship.

We inform you aboutthe research results, and want to create an independent,positive image and thus trust in scientific work. Simultane-ously we try to bridge the gap between research institutionand general public and hence get new impetus and ideas. Wepromote the perception of our research among the communi-ty, the press, government, corporate partners, prospective stu-dents, alumni and our own internal community. It is a matterof great importance that not only the scientific community butin fact anyone interested in modern science should have theopportunity to get an idea about the aims of our institute.Attention, interest and finally trust in science must be one ofour most important concerns. Therefore we inform journalists with profound news and background knowledge about current research. To pursue thistask press releases are edited, brochures - such as thisReport - are published and distributed on request and infor-mal support is provided whenever necessary. Beside classicalPress and Public Relations the complete conception, organi-sation and realisation of events is a second core theme. One of our highlights every two years is the Open Day on the Potsdam-Golm Science Park, which is an interesting andfun-packed day, combining demonstrations of high-tech learn-ing facilities with hands on activities for all age groups. TheOpen Day 2013 will be held together with the Max PlanckInstitutes of Gravitational Physics and Molecular Plant Physi-ology, the Fraunhofer Institutes for Applied Polymer ResearchIAP and for Biomedical Engineering IBMT, the Golm InnovationCenter GO:IN and the Brandenburg Main State Archive. Ittakes place on September 14 from 11 a.m. till 5 p.m. Therewill be lab tours, popular talks and scientific demonstrationsproviding an excellent opportunity for everybody to experi-ence scientific activity at first hand. Furthermore the MPICI took part in a further important event: the \"IdeasPark Essen 2012\". Technology experiencewas being held at Messe Essen and Grugapark from August11 to 23. An area of 60,000 square meters was given over tothe fascination of technology. More than 120 partners fromresearch, science, education and business attractedaround 400,000 visitors. The emphasis was on inter-action. Throughout the IdeasPark, visitors were invited to carry out their own experiments and make their own discoveries.Thevisitorsgot to knowvarious interestingbiomaterials from the for-est and the sea: always sharp sea urchin teeth, the un -breakable skeleton of the deep sea sponge Euplectella orwheat seeds, which are able to \"swim\" into the soil. Togeth-er with scientists from the Institute they discovered the prin-ciple of hierarchical structure. They learned how organismsuse the available resources in a very efficient manner and thatthis can serve as a model for the development of new techni-cal materials. Beyond this tours through the institute as well as talks at schools are organized. But also the internet presence and theinternal communication are additional important fields withinPress and Public Relations. We try to create awareness for the role of basic research in general, especially with regard to future developments incolloid and interface science. We also seek to show that theworld of science and technology is fascinating, challenging,varied and rewarding. Within these pages you can find thelatest news from the institute as well as a more in depth lookat our research. If you have any further questions, please con-tact us. We are pleased to help you.

Together we define this as Biological Materials Science which is inherently multidisciplinary between physics, chem-istry and biology. All three areas mentioned above areaddressed in the Department with a significantly strongeremphasis on the first two. To tackle such questions, themembers of the Department have very diverse scientificbackgrounds, including mathematics, physics, chemistry,materials science, physical chemistry, biochemistry, woodscience, botany, zoology and molecular biology. In the course of evolution, load-bearing biological mate- rials have generally not evolved towards perfection and max-imum strength, but instead developed high defect toleranceand adaptability [1]. Adaption occurs at various levels, see figure 1. While evolution leads to adaptation of entirespecies, each individual has mechanisms which confer someself-repair properties even at smaller scales to cope with avariety of environmental challenges. Healing and regenera-tion occur at the level of organs, but many biological materi-als are damage-tolerant at the supra-molecular level or have(passive) self-repair properties ( see Fig. 1 ). Research TopicsThe Department addresses the adaptation of natural materi-als according to all three levels mentioned in Figure 1, both toadvance the understanding of these biological systems, aswell as to extract concepts for the development of adaptive,self-healing or multi-functional materials. The adaptation byevolution (cycle (a) in Fig. 1 ) can be studied by comparing the details of material structure (such as teeth, bones, or shells) inclosely related species and comparing these to the variabilityin function due, for example, to differences in habitat. Thisperspective is taken in particular by Mason Dean in the con- text of fish skeletons and by Michaela Eder , studying to plants which, for example, adapt to frequent fires (see their reports). Bone remodeling is also a process by which damaged tis- sue is continuously replaced by newly synthesized materialand, thus, an interesting case of adaptation (cycle (b) in Fig. 1 ). Bone remodeling generally depends on a dense net- work of mechanosensitive cells, called osteocytes. This net-work is such that all mineralized tissue in bone is not furtheraway from the next osteocyte canaliculum than about onemicron, making the network an extremely effective transportsystem [2]. While bone continuously repairs damage through remodeling, it needs a more complicated process to healafter a fracture occurred. The healing process is a matter ofintensive research in the Department in collaboration withthe Charit\u00e9 University Hospital in Berlin and other partners.The questions of healing, remodeling and mechanical adap-tation of bone are addressed by the groups of Wolfgang Wagermaier and Richard Weinkamer (see their reports). In addition, scaffold-supported healing is studied in-vivo [3]as well as in-vitro [4], primarily to elucidate the interaction between growing tissue and the geometric constraints fromthe scaffold material (see report by John Dunlop ).

(a) Darwinian evolution acts on the species level to adapt to long-term chal- lenges, such as habitat, food type or predators. (b) Remodeling, healing or regeneration operate at the organ level within an individual organism. (c) Biological materials, such as bone, extracellular tissue or protein fibers are damage tolerant and often have self-repair mechanisms that operate on the supra-molecular level. ically oriented research on bone diseases, such as osteoporo- sis and osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) is car-ried out in close collaboration with the Ludwig BoltzmannInstitute of Osteology in Vienna, Austria. While bone remodeling and healing are processes operat- ing at the organ level (similarly to many kinds of wound healingin animals or plants), there are also intrinsic material proper-ties which provide damage tolerance and self-repair (cycle (c)in Fig. 1 ). Examples are deformable interfaces connecting stiff protein or polysaccharide fibers or mineral platelets and capa-ble of absorbing large deformations in tissues, such as ten-dons or plant cell walls [5]. In some cases, damage is fully recovered over a short or a longer period of time, thus provid-ing some type of self-repair. This is a major topic in theresearch group of Matthew J. Harrington (see his report). Natural materials are not only based on proteins or cellu- lose, but in many organisms also on chitin. Arthoropods, suchas spiders for example, use their chitin cuticle to house awide range of sensors and tools which are highly excitingexamples of unusual engineering solutions for a variety oftechnical problems. The group of Yael Politi is primarily focus- ing on this type of research (see her report). The interaction ofwater with all these biomolecules (proteins and polysaccha-rides alike) plays an important role for their mechanicalbehavior, including materials properties, such as stiffness andtoughness, but also actuation and the generation of internalstresses. This topic is addressed by Luca Bertinetti and par- tially also in the group of John Dunlop (see their reports). Biomineralization is a further strong topic of the Depart- ment. Its director has just been chairing the Gordon ResearchConference on Biomineralization in 2012. Damien Faivre , who's research group is being essentially supported by anERC Starting Grant from the European Research Council,works on elucidating how bacteria control the growth ofmagnetite nanoparticles through the interaction with special-ized proteins (see his report). Together with partners at theWeizmann Institute (Prof. Lia Addadi), we were awarded a 5-year grant from the German Science Foundation (within theDIP-Program) to study the origin of the stability of amorphousbio-minerals [6,7]. Wouter Habraken is strongly active in this project (see his report) and Yael Politi's group is also involvedin some of this research. Until spring 2012, Barbara Aichmay-er was heading a group concentrating on biominerization of calcium-based minerals. She already left in summer 2012and no report is included. Some of her publications are, how- ever, mentioned here [6,8,10,11] and in other places of this report (see for example the section by Admir Masic ).Methodological ApproachesGenerally, the experimental approach is based on multi-method imaging where different probes are used to imagethe same specimen. This provides information on differentfeatures of the materials such as micro-structure, chemicalcomposition, or mechanical properties in a position-resolvedmanner with micron-range resolution. We are currentlydeveloping and using multi-method characterization ap -proaches combining x-ray tomography; scanning electronmicroscopy and scanning x-ray diffraction to characterizemicro- and nanostructure and many levels of structural hier-archy (see report by Wolfgang Wagermaier ). We have estab- lished polarized and confocal Raman imaging to provideinformation on chemical composition and fiber orientation,which is now being combined in-situ with synchrotron x-rayscattering by Admir Masic use tation as well as acoustic microscopy to estimate localmechanical properties. Currently, Igor Zlotnikov is establish- ing modulus mapping which pushes the lateral resolution ofmechanical characterization into the nanometer range (seehis report). The strength of this multi-method approach isthat the different parameters measured on the same speci-men can be correlated at the local level with micron (or evensmaller)-scale spatial resolution. This facilitates the extrac-tion of structure-property relationships even in extremelyheterogeneous materials with hierarchical structure. In a second type of approach, we study in situ changes in various materials (e.g. due to mechanical stress or to chemi-cal or thermal processing) by time-resolved scattering orspectroscopy during mechanical deformation or thermal orhygroscopic treatment. This gives insight into the molecularand supramolecular mechanisms which are responsible forthe noteworthy properties of these materials. In some cases,such measurements can be performed in the laboratory (e.g.with Raman or infrared spectroscopy or in the environmentalscanning electron microscope), but in many cases synchro-tron radiation is needed (e. g. for x-ray diffraction or small-angle scattering). A dedicated beamline end station for scan-ning small- and wide-angle scattering and fluorescence spec-troscopy is the synchrotron at theHelmholtz Zentrum Berlin [8]. These efforts are complemented by a significant effort in mathematical modeling, which is always closely tied to theexperimental work in the department. Typically, modeling andexperimentation go hand in hand with the research projects(see for example the reports by John W.C. but diamonds:Biological materials are not forever,Acta Mater 61, 880 - 889 (2013).

Franz Dieter Fischer , professor of mechanics at the Montanuniversit\u00e4t Leoben (Austria)recipient of the Alexander von Humboldt Award, came formany short visits, which helped advance the mathematicalmodeling of tissue growth in particular (see report by J.W.C. Dunlop ) and was involved in theoretical research about the mechanical properties of biological hybrid materials [9]. Hart- mut Metzger arrived in the beginning of 2010 from the Euro- pean Synchrotron Radiation Facilities (ESRF), where he hadbeen a staff scientist and group head responsible for severalbeamlines. He brought many years of experience in x-ray dif-fraction, in particular with grazing incidence and using coher-ent beams, to our Department. He is by now involved in anumber of projects utilizing synchrotron radiation such as thestudy of biomimetic minerals [10]and other topics mentioned in the reports that follow. Emil Zolotoyabko , professor of materials science at the Technion (Israel Institute of Technol-ogy) spent several months of a sabbatical in the Departmenton continues to visit on a regular basis. He is also involved ina number of projects on studying biosilica (see report by Igor Zlotnikov ) as well as other biomineralized tissues [11]. Yves Br\u00e9chet , professor of materials science at the Institut Nation- al Polytechnique de Grenoble (INPG) and at the Institut (IUF) as well as \"Haut Commissaire \u00e0l'Energie Atomique\" received the Gay Lussac-HumboldtAward and is visiting our Department from 2012 onwards.Most recently, Scott White , professor at the University of Illi- nois at Urbana-Champaign received the Humboldt ResearchAward and is visiting the Department in 2013. His research isfocused on developing self-healing and self-remodeling engi-neering materials. In addition to developing new collabora-tions, our visiting scholars play an important role in the men-toring of young scientists, and we are most grateful to themfor this very important contribution. The majority of the research in the Department of Biomateri- als involves collaborations - within the Department, withother Departments in the Institute and with many outsidepartners around the world to whom we all extend our sinceregratitude for cultivating and fostering such positive and con-structive partnerships. Peter Fratzl Director of the Department of Biomaterials O., Predan, J., Fischer F.D., Fratzl, criteria for damage-resistant materials with period-ically varying 2058 (2011).The most widely studied hard biomaterials of vertebrates are the bones and teeth of mammals, but these represent just asmall proportion of the overall living diversity. Fishes offer arich research system in providing a huge diversity of skeletaltissues, species (there are more fish than all other vertebratetaxa combined), and ecologies. Also, being comparativelybasal (\"primitive\") lineages of vertebrates, this systemallows us to ask wider questions relating to skeletal and den-tal evolution, both within fishes and vertebrates as a whole.Through collaborations with researchers at the MPI and otherinstitutions, we examine \u2014at multiple scales\u2014 the relation-ships between tissue structure and mechanical performance,allowing derivation of important design principles for bioma-terials and manmade composites with structural roles. How Can Cartilage Perform the Roles of Bone? I was baffled when I first heard that sharks and rays haveskeletons made of cartilage. How could such a material meetsimilar functional demands to bone, yet without the capacityfor remodeling and repair [1-2]? In fact, their cartilage is struc - turally quite unique, comprised of an unmineralized gel likeours but wrapped in a sheath of mineralized tiles ( Fig. 1 ) [2-3]. Fig. 1 - Tessellated (tiled) cartilage of sharks and rays. We are investigating the structure and performance of thistissue composite at a variety of levels: correlating tissuematerial properties and structure of individual tiles using acombination of scanning acoustic microscopy, x-ray scatter-ing, nanoindentation and backscatter imaging (withDmitri Wolfgang Wagermeier, MPI); using synchro- tron radiation tomography to visualize and quantify ultra-structural growth patterns, which are then used to build physical and theoretical models to test how the geometry of mineralized tiles affects tissue mechanics (with S\u00e9bastienTurcaud, MPI; Paul Zaslansky, Charit\u00e9 Hospital;James Weaver, engineering theoryto analyze CT scans of whole jaws of sharkswith a wide range diets to ask how the min-eralized tissue layer is arranged to meet dif-fering functional demands (with John Dunlop,MPI; Laura Habegger, Univ. S. Florida; Dan Huber,Univ. Tampa, USA). By pairing the synthesis of theseanalyses with studies of organismal performance [4-5], our work will clarify the selective pressures involved in the evo-lution and maintenance of this ancient skeletal type, provid-ing clues to inform development of low-density, high-stiff-ness/high-damp ing engineering composites for human appli-cations. Is Bone Still \"Bone\" if it has no Cells? One of the hallmarks of the bone of mammals is the presenceof numerous cells within the tissue (osteocytes), responsiblefor monitoring bone strains, then orchestrating building andremodelling responses to reduce them. A large proportion ofthe bones of fish with bony skeletons, however, completelylack these cells and yet these \"acellular\" skeletons appear tobe able to accomplish all the tasks normally attributed toosteocytes in mammals. Through collaboration with Ron Sha-har (Hebrew University, Jerusalem), we are working to char-acterize the material and structural properties of fish boneand its response to load in vivo , and to examine these prop- erties within the broader context of vertebrate bone. Ourdirect tests of various bone types and a metadata analysis ofhundreds of literature sources (with John Dunlop, MPI) indi-cate that compared to other vertebrate bones, both \"cellular\"and \"acellular\" fish bone are less mineralized and less stiff,but also can sustain much greater deformations before fail-ing [6-7]. Our insights into the structure, physiology and mechanics of fish bone contribute to the discipline of fishskeletal biology, but may answer basic questions of bonebiology, in particular relating to the osteocytic function andthe regulation of bone deposition and resorption. The understandings provided by these studies help demar- cate the full range of morphologies and functions available tocalcium-phosphate based mineralized tissues, allowing us toaddress much larger questions of how form-function relation-ships are formed, are constrained and how they evolve.

J Exp 215:1983-1993 (2012).BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS Evolutionary Perspectives on Vertebrate Hard TissuesProteins are the primary building blocks of countless biological materials ranging from spider silk and tendon collagen to hair and cornea. The organization and chemical structure of these building blocks holds important clues to the properties of the mate- rials they compose. Using traditional biochem- ical and molecular biology techniques combined with those from materials science and chemistry, our group focuses on establishing fundamental relationships between the protein components of natural materials, theirhierarchical organization, and the material properties andfunction. Once these design concepts have been \"extracted\",they can be applied by polymer scientists to create biomimet-ic materials with enhanced properties. Fig. 1: Marine materials such as the byssus and whelk egg capsule are adapted to be very tough. They are composed almost entirely of proteinbuilding blocks, and by understanding the biochemical structure andorganization of these proteins, we gain important insights into structure-function relationships that define the materials. Current research in the group is divided into two primary emphases: 1. Characterization of protein-based biologicalmaterials from marine organisms 2. Biochemical investiga-tions of biomolecules with a specific focus on metal-bindingproteins. These two foci are separate but complementaryaspects of the group, both of which are aimed at understand-ing the biochemical and structural factors that provide inter-esting material properties such as underwater adhesion,increased toughness and self-repair. Characterization of Marine Materials One prominent aspect of our research is the characterizationof structure-function relationships in protein-based materialsproduced by marine organisms, with a specific focus on those with high toughness or self-repair behaviors. Along these lines, two projects in the group that saw significant advances in the last two years were structural and spectroscopicanalyses of mussel byssal threads and whelk egg capsules.Role Framework in Byssus Self-HealingMussel byssal threads are protein-based fibers used by mus-sels to create a strong attachment in wave-swept marineenvironments. Byssal threads possess notable mechanicalproperties, including a combination of high stiffness andextensibility that leads to high toughness and the ability toself-heal. Stefanie Krau\u00df (former postdoc) has carried out a project to look at in situ structural changes in the structural order of the protein building blocks of mussel byssal threadsduring stretching and subsequent self-healing [1]. Our results indicate that the protein making up byssal threads are highlyorganized axially and laterally into an ordered elastic frame-work. When stretched, this order is largely lost; however, itre covers elastically almost instantaneously when unloaded.Structural recovery, however, does not lead to mechanical re -covery, which requires much longer time scales. The majorconclusion was that the structural order facilitates mechani-cal healing by bringing sacrificially ruptured cross-links backinto spatial register so that they can re-form. The results ofthis study offer potential inspiration for the development of anew generation of self-healing polymers (currently most areisotropic). Current research in the group by Clemens Schmitt is focused on spectroscopically characterizing the sacrificial cross-links, which are believed to be coordination bonds be tween thebyssal proteins and metal ions, such as Zn 2+ gastropods lay theireggs protective capsules. The protein-based material thatmakes up the whelk egg capsule (WEC) has been recentlyrecognized for exhibiting a very remarkable mechanical be -havior called pseudoelasticity. This means that when thematerial is deformed it dissipates large quantities of me -chanical energy as hysteresis; however, like an elastic material,it returns instantaneously to its initial length and structure. Itis capable of numerous loading cycles without exhibitingfatigue, and in doing so, can dissipate large amounts of me -chanical energy from crashing waves or attacking predators. In this study, performed in collaboration with researchers from the US, UK and Austria, the structural and chemicalchanges of the component protein building blocks wereassessed at various levels of hierarchy using a combinationof in situ wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering and Raman spectroscopy while simultaneously performing me -chanical tensile experiments [2]. From these experiments, we gained important insights into the molecular level mecha-nisms of pseudoelasticity in the WEC, including the observa- 34 Matthew James Harrington 30.08.19802002: B.A., Biological Sciences (University of Delaware, USA)2008: PhD, Marine Science (University of California Santa Barbara, USA)Thesis: Molecular level structure-prop-erty relationships in the byssal threadsof marine mussels2008-2010: Alexander in Load-Bearing Natural MaterialsBIOLOGICAL MATERIALS tion of a critical phase transition between an ordered -heli- cal protein structure and a disordered protein structure dur-ing the yield plateau. Based on these results, we created asimplified mathematical model to describe the equilibriummechanical behavior of the WEC centered on a molecularphase transition. Further modeling efforts are underway withPeter Fratzl and Dieter Fischer to help explain the non-equi- librium behavior including strain-rate dependence and hys-teresis. Additionally, we are collaborating with Ali Miserez (NTSU) in a comparative approach examining the structureand mechanical behaviors of WEC from different species. Characterization of Biological Building Blocks The other main focus in our group is the characterization ofproteins that compose biological materials in order to developa more biochemical understanding of how protein se quence,conformation and cross-linking affect material properties,such as underwater adhesion and self-repair. Along theselines, a major focus is the use of protein-metal coordinationcross-links by organisms to tune mechanical properties. Mussel Adhesive Proteins The adhesive prowess of the mussel byssus under conditionswhere man-made adhesive simply fail is well known in theliterature; however, surprisingly, there is only a cursory under -standing of the mechanisms of adhesion at the molecular level.In collaboration with Dong Soo Hwang (UCSB), we combined mechanical measurements of adhesion by mussel proteinsusing a surface force apparatus (SFA) with spectroscopiccharacterization of the interaction at the adhesive interfaceusing Raman It was mussel foot protein-1 (MFP-1) depends largely on the bidentate coordination of theTi ion by the oxygen atoms on the DOPA catechol ring ( Fig. 2 ). TiO 2is a well known alloy used in biomedical applications and this strong attachment occurred in the presence of asalty buffered solution, demonstrating the potential of mus-sel inspired chemistry for biomedical applications, such asdental adhesives and coatings for biomedical implants.Fig. 2: Marine mussels make prodigious use of DOPA in roles such as adhesion, hardening, and self-repair. Experiments on DOPA containingproteins and polymers indicate that much of this behavior arises from theability of DOPA to form stable coordination bonds with metal ions such asFe, V, and Ti. Mussel Inspired Biomimetic Polymers In collaboration with Niels Holten-Andersen (MIT) continued efforts to create polymers that utilize the DOPA-metal coordi-nation cross-link chemistry of the mussel byssus produced a PEG-DOPA tough and self-healing behaviors dependenton metal cross-links [4]. Currently, we are exploring the effect of metal ion and pH-dependence on the degree of cross-link-ing and mechanical performance.

For example, it forms the cell walls of fungi, plays major roles in the mollusc skeletal and mouth parts, and is the main building block of all arthropod cuticles. It is therefore possi- ble to find biological chitin based materials with extremely wide range of physical, and in particular, mechanical properties. Due to its wide- spread abundance and biocompatibility chitin is also exten- sively used in diverse industrial processes and has found var-ious technological and medical applications [1]. The study of chitin and chitin based materials therefore holds a promisefor clever bio-inspired materials design. The cuticle of arthropods is an example for such a family of materials. The large diversity seen in the arthropod phylumis also reflected in an ample diversity of cuticular materialswith different physical properties that serve many differentbiological functions forming the external skeleton, skin,sense organs and more. The cuticle can be described as afiber reinforced composite material, where -chitin crystal-lites tightly coated by a protein shell form the fibrous phaseand the matrix is composed of a wide range of proteins [1]. The main goals of our newly formed group is to obtain basic understanding of the cuticular material on the one handand to gain insight into the structure-function relations inspecific functional organs such as cuticular tools (e.g. fangs,claws) and mechanosensors, on the other hand; We work inclose collaboration with Prof. Friedrich Barth , from the Uni- versity of Vienna (Vienna, Austria) Prof. Vladimir Tsukruk from Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta, USA) and Prof. Leeor Kronik from the Weizmann Institute of Science (Rehovot, Israel). The current members of the group are Dr. Clara Valverde Serrano , Dr. Schonert addition Ms. Ana Licuco and Dr. Benny Bar-On are expected to join the group during the coming semester. Basic Research: Understanding of the Cuticular Material at the Molecular LevelWe study the chitin-protein interaction, the cuticle interac-tion with water and the properties of the matrix in terms ofcomposition, for example metal ions and halogen incorpora- tion or mineralization (in crustaceans) and their effect oncuticle properties, and the chemical interaction between dif-ferent cuticular components. That water sorption has a strong effect on the cuticle is well documented. Maturation processes of the cuticle i.e.sclerotization involve drastic changes in cuticle hydrationstate, especially in the exocuticle. Cuticle dehydration oftenresults in significant increase in the cuticle stiffness and brit-tleness. Nevertheless the exact manner in which water isadsorbed in the different cuticle layers (i.e. exo- meso- andendo-cuticle) is still unknown. Water sorption is studied by X-ray scattering, thermo-gravimetric analysis and differentialscanning calorimetry and other techniques. Together with Dr.Luca Bertinetti we use a method based on Infrared Lock-InThermography to spatially resolve and image water sorptionin the main cuticular layers ( Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1: water sorption in different cuticular layers. (A) Infrared lock-in thermography mapping of a cuticle section from the tibia (leg) of thespider Cupiennius salei. The colours in the image relate to the tempera-ture of the sample resulting from the variable amount of water sorptionat the sample surface and its energetics. Highest water sorption occursat the endo-cuticle, however with low temperature increase (blue),whereas the exo-cuticle adsorbs less water, but with higher increase intemperature and is therefore seen blue. The meso-cuticle is white indi-cating intermediate level of water sorption/temperature change. (B)SEM image of the sample, scale bar = 1\u00b5m.

We have studied 1this phe- nomenon in the spider's cheliceral fangs that are used toinject venom into prey. The fangs are rich in Zn, Ca and Clwith specific spatial distribution. Interestingly, the spiders'claws contain high levels of Mn ions. The manner in whichthese ions are incorporated is however still unclear. It is alsounknown, what is the adaptive advantage of using a specificmetal ion relative to another in the various tools. Amongstthe various approaches we employ in this study, we take useof element-specific spectroscopy and microscopy techniquessuch with Pippel , MPI of Microstructure Physics, Halle) ( Fig. 2 ) that allowed us to identify the Zn com- plexation by His residues in the fang matrix. 36Yael Politi 10.9.1976 1999-2001: Bachelor of Science majoring in Biology (with Honours) (Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel)2002-2004: MSc.

Structure Function Relations in the Cuticle In fiber-reinforced material such as the arthropod cuticle,fiber orientation is a primary factor determining theanisotropy of the mechanical properties. In addition, lamellathickness and other structural motifs have large effect on thematerials response to mechanical load. We aim at establish-ing direct correlation between organ morphology and chitinfiber arrangement, in terms of microstructure, fiber align-ment and orientation and the spatial arrangement of differ-ent microstructural motifs within a functional organ/tool. Forexample, in the spider fang we have characterized variousstructural motifs and established gradient in mechanicalproperties that results from changes in degree of fiber align-ment, in addition to the influence of metal ions [ref]. We use a similar approach to study the structure-function relation in the study of the spiders mechano-sensors (see below).Mechano-Sensing in SpidersThe spider cuticle is covered by numerous cuticular-sensorsthat react with remarkable sensitivity and specificity to awide range of mechanical stimuli (medium flow, substratevibration and cuticle strain) [2]. Filtering of back-ground noise from relevant information occurs at the material/organ levelwhich makes these structures appealing as models for thebio-inspired design of mechanoresponsive and adaptivenanostructured materials. In order to exploit fundamental principles found in natu- ral mechanoreceptors for bio-inspired materials, we focus onunderstanding the mechanism of mechanical signal detec-tion, transmission and filtration for the spider slit biosensorysystem at the material level. We investigate the direct spa-tial correlation among cuticle morphology, hierarchical struc-tural organization and micromechanical properties in spiderslit-sensilla as well as hair like sensors ( Fig. 3 ). We explore the time-dependent micromechanical properties of biologicalstrain receptors embedded in the spider exoskeleton withhigh spatial resolution (down to a few nanometers) andrelate the findings to the function of these organs as sensi-tive vibrational filters and efficient transmitters of externalmechanical stimuli.

Siegel, H.Li, Fratzl, AdvancedFunctional Materials Barth, Nature 462(7272), 442 (2009). Complex biological materials, such as bone, silk or wood, often exhibit outstanding me - chanical properties, a feature that can be directly related to their functional adapta- tions and interactions at multiple hierarchical length scales. Raman spectroscopic imaging, a non-invasive and label-free approach to obtain both chemical (molecular interactions), and struc- tural (orientation) information with sub-micro meter precision, is a powerful tool for the molecular level characteri - zation of such materials. The primary focus of our research is the in situ study of biological and biomimetic materials at various levels of hier-archy (from the molecular up to the macroscopic scale) takingadvantage of advanced spectroscopic imaging techniques. [1-5] One of our research goals, for example, is to map collagen fib-ril orientation in a wide range of different tissue types byevaluating its molecular response to a polarized laser source( Fig. 1 ).[6] Fig. 1: Polarized Raman mapping of collagen fibril orientation in the crimp region of an un-stretched, fully hydrated rat tail tendon. The hier- archical structure of collagen (A), an optical microscopy image of the crimp region (B) and its corresponding collagen orientation map (C) withmagnified regions of interest (D and E). For further details see ref. [6]. We are currently applying this methodology to map both the three-dimensional orientation of collagen in biological mate- rials and the evolution of collagen organization in hard and soft tissues formed in the fracture gap (callus) during the process of bone healing in rats (with J. Dunlop , Biomaterials, and G. Duda , Charit\u00e9 Hospital Berlin).The ultimate aim of our work is to link the structural organi-zation and chemical composition to the physical properties ofbiological material. [3, 6-9] One such example is a collabora- tion with B. Aichmayer (Biomaterials) and A. Berman (Ben- Gurion University, Israel), where we used Raman spectro-scopic imaging to study the chemical composition andmicrostructure of the ultra-tough and damage tolerant 2: imaging of the crayfish (A) anterior molar.

Raman imaging of the phosphate distribution(D), carbonate to phosphate intensity ratio (E), and the phosphate peakposition (F). For details see ref. [9]. Our results reveal that the crayfish molar is a highly com plex, periodically renewable organ, in which a unique architectureof amorphous and crystalline calcium carbonate and phos-phate minerals constitutes a tool with mechanical propertiescomparable to those exhibited by mammalian teeth. In addition to our work with high performance biological materials, and in collaboration with Federal Institute forMaterials Research and Testing (BAM, I. Rabin ), Helmholtz- Zentrum (HZB, of Torino (R. Gobetto ), we have also applied these techniques to the investigation of ancient historical manuscripts. For example,by combining polarized Raman, far infrared, and nuclear mag-netic resonance spectroscopy techniques we have been ableto directly investigate, in unprecedented detail, the changesin collagen structure during the deterioration of the Dead SeaScrolls.

The building blocks at all hierarchical levels are usu-ally joined together by a gluing material to obtain a functionalstructu re. Although internal interfaces between the buildingblocks comprise only a small volume fraction of the en tirestructure, mechanical properties of biomaterials are governedby their properties. In most cases, the building blocks areglued together by an organic softer phase. This interface canexhibit interpenetration of the two compounds, more thanone order of magnitude change in elastic modulus, rough-ness, viscoelastic behavior and more. Thus, the main focus inthis work is measuring the mechanical and compositional gra-dation across the interface between a single building blockand the surrounding gluing medium, which is important forunderstanding the overall behaviour of the entire struc ture.This eventually, will have a significant impact on bio-inspiredmulti-scale composite material synthesis. In order to measure gradual change of mechanical prop- erties across an interface, we adapted a recently developednanoscale modulus mapping technique and combined it withreverse finite element analysis [1]. The basis of the modulus mapping technique is the well-established nanoindentationinstrumentation employing a Berkovich diamond tip. Thus,when measuring inside nanometric inclusions, the obtainedmodulus is strongly affected by the modulus of the matrix.Therefore, a detailed simulation by finite element approachis required to extrapolate the real value of the elastic moduli. This methodology was first used to map the elastic mod- ulus across a 35 nm thick organic layer within biosilica in agiant anchor spicule of the glass sponge Monorhaphis chuni [2]. M. chuni, is a deep sea glass sponge that belongs to the class of Hexactinellida and is among the earliest multicellularanimals found as fossils. The most fascinating feature of thesponge is the giant basal spicule around which the animal isassembled. This spicule is used for anchoring the animal tothe ocean's bottom and can reach up to 3 m in length and 8 mmin diameter. An organic filament, nearly 2 \u00b5m in diameter, pro -vides the central vertical axis of the spicule with biosilicacylinders arranged in nearly concentric layers (2-10 \u00b5m wide)around it ( Fig. 1a organic layers ( Fig. 1b ). Fig. 1: (a) - SEM micrograph of the spicule cross-section (plane view) showing alternating biosilica-organic layers (scale bar is 1 \u00b5m); (b) -HAADF-STEM image of an individual organic layer (plane-view projection, scale bar is 20 nm) taken from the area indicated by a square box in (a).After iterative simulations of the mapping procedure across the organic layer ( Fig. 2a, b) we find the best fit to experimental results with modulus of 0.7 GPa in theorganic layer as compared to 37 GPa in thebioglass. This indicates an impressive per-formance of the animal and a drastic increaseof its fracture stress [3]. Furthermore, a modulus gradient extends 50 nm into the glass layer, probablydue to spatial distribution of small organic inclusions ( Fig. 2c ). Fig. 2: (a) - a simulated Von Misses stress distribution map when the tip touches the left edge of the organic layer (I - organic layer, II - steepmodulus gradient, III - biosilica); (b) - a simulated Von Misses stressdistribution map when the tip touches both edges of the organic layer;(c) - resulted elastic modulus distribution across the organic layer. With this new methodology it becomes possible to determine elastic moduli of nanometric inclusions even when embed-ded in a 50 times stiffer matrix. Currently, this technique is applied to investigate interface properties in other bio-structures such as the calcite/organic interface in the pris-matic layer of the giant shell Pinna nobilis and to resolve the different ultrathin layers in the cell wall of the in Materials Engineer- ing, B.A. in Physics (Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel)2003-2005: M.Sc. in Materials Engineering (Technion - Israel Instituteof Technology, Haifa, Israel)2005-2009: Ph.D. in Materials Engineer- ing (Technion - Israel Institute of Tech-nology, Haifa, Israel)Since 08/2009: Postdoctoral Scientist, (Department of Biomaterials, Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces)Since 7/2012: Independent Researcher (Department of Biomaterials, andInterfaces, ZolotoyabkoE. and Fratzl P .: Mapping nanomechani-cal properties near internal interfaces in biological materials.

Mechanical Characterization of Internal Interfaces in Biomaterials BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS Bone health is intimately linked to the pro - cesses of bone mineralization, remodeling and healing. The control of these processes occurs at the level of the cells, not only via biochemical signaling, but also via physical, in particular mechanical stimuli. Nowadays animal experiments cannot directly address cellular regulation, but are limited to the structur- al changes on the tissue level. Computer experiments can help bridge the gap between the cellular and the tissue level. In the computer model hypotheses about cellular regu-lation are implemented and the consequences for the tissueare calculated [1]. When modeling different bone processes, two aspects are important: (i) structural chan ges occur at verydifferent length scales, from conformational changes of thecollagen molecule to the bridging of a macroscopic bone frac-ture; (ii) the importance of mechanics de mands not only anaccurate description of the external loading, but also a char-acterization of the local mechanical properties of the tissues.Scanning acoustic microscopy is a promising technique tomeasure functional properties of biological materials innative wet conditions in a non-destructive way. Collagen Structure, Mineralization and Remodeling The initial stage of the mineralization process in bone isinfluenced by the molecular structure of collagen. This struc-ture in turn depends on the presence of water and ions in itsclose environment. Together with the Theory Department weused Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to investigatehow various collagen-like peptides change their structure, inparticular their helicity, depending on ion environments con-taining Ca 2+or Na+. The simulations showed that the helicitychanges with the ion concentration in regions, where therepetitive sequence of amino acids is not retained ( Fig. 1 ). The processes of bone mineralization and remodeling result in a patchwork structure of bone on the length scale ofroughly 50 \u00b5m, which can be imagined in the electron micro-scope using the backscattered mode (qBEI). In our mathemati-cal description of this material heterogeneity, we corrected forthe finite acquisition time during the qBEI-measurement [2]. The model can then predict the evolution of this heterogene-ity in scenarios of bone diseases and medical treatment. Fordiagnostic purposes the discrimination between scenarios ofa changed rate of bone remodeling and a disordered mineral-ization process is of particular importance. The spatial het-erogeneity of the mineral content in bone can also be used totest current theories about the control of bone remodeling [3]. In vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) opens a new possibility to monitor structural changes in the bone ofliving small animals. In collaboration with the ETH Z\u00fcrich, wedeveloped an evaluation method of micro-CT images to quan-tify the (de)mineralization kinetics in mice after depositionand before bone, respectively ( Fig. 2 ). Measure- ments on mice, where the investigated vertebra was me cha -ni cally loaded, compared to the unloaded control group, indi-cate that loading accelerates the incorporation of mineralinto the bone ( Fig. 2 ) [4]. Micro-CT images of human trabecular bone of different agecan also be used to learn about the control of trabecular boneremodeling. In the model the changes in the thickness of tra-beculae during remodeling are described by a Markov chain.The calculated probabilities for bone deposition or resorptionas a function of the thickness of the trabeculae show that themechanical regulation of remodeling can be well describedby a threshold above which bone deposition sets in [5]. In cortical bone, remodeling leads to the formation of cylindrical structures called osteons, which house a bloodvessel in its central osteonal canal for nutrition supply. Wequantified the order in the arrangement of osteons in the cor- 40 Richard Weinkamer 14.08.1967 1995: Diploma, Mathematics (University of Vienna) Thesis: The modular group: an investigation with methods of combinatorial group theory1998: Research Stay (Rutgers University, New Jersey)2000: PhD, Physics (University of Vienna)Thesis: Diffusion and diffusional phasetransformations in binary alloys: MonteCarlo Schmid Institute of MaterialsScience, Leoben)Since 2003: Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, Potsdam)2012: Habilitation in Theoretical Physics (Humboldt University, Berlin) Thesis: Pro cesses in living bone and the result-ing structural changes - compu tationalstudiesMechanobiologyBIOLOGICAL MATERIALS helical angle [degrees] R, 0N R, 8N Reference # Fig. 1: Molecular model of a collagen-like peptide with 30 amino acids in an ionic environment containing Ca2+.

Modelcalculations showed that the measured order could be wellunderstood under the assumption that osteonal canals aresurrounded by an \"exclusion zone\", which inhibits the forma-tion of other canals within this zone [6], ensuring an efficient supply with nutrients. Mechanical Heterogeneity of Bone The heterogeneity of the mineral content as described in thelast section together with the anisotropic structure of thematerial, results in a mechanical heterogeneity of bone.Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) allows measuring thisheterogeneity with a lateral resolution of roughly 1 \u00b5m. Themeasured acoustic reflectivity from the bone surface de -pends on two local characteristics of the sample, the effec-tive stiffness and the mass density. Via combination of anelectron backscattered image (qBEI) containing the informa-tion about the local density and of two SAM-measurementswith acoustic lenses of different resolution the effectivestiffness of compact bone in a human femur was calculated.In the evaluation we separated the younger bone of anosteon formed by remodeling process from the surroundingolder so-called interstitial bone ( Fig. 3 ). The average value for the effective stiffness of the interstitial bone is more than25% larger in the osteon, which can be largely explained byits higher mineral content. For both, osteons and interstitialbone, SAM maps show oscillations in the effective stiffnesswith a wavelength of approximately 5 \u00b5m, which is the typi-cal thickness of a bone lamella. This mechanical heterogene-ity can be understood based on the anisotropic arrangementof the mineralized tissue. An evident clinical application ofSAM is to complement structural images of bone biopsieswith functional images of the mechanical properties toassess more directly bone quality. Bone Regeneration and Healing The regenerative property of bone allows healing of macro-scopic defects as occurring, for example, after bone fracture.Via the transient presence of additional tissue called the cal-lus, successful healing leads to a return to the pre-fracturedstate. One peculiarity of the process is that not only newbone is formed within the callus, but transiently also soft tis-sue like fibrous tissue and cartilage. Another peculiarity isthat the reconnection of the broken bone ends does not occur\"directly\" via a bridging of the fracture by new bone forma-tion. Bone healing rather occurs \"indirectly\" with the brokenends first reconnect outside of the fracture gap. To address the above mentioned peculiarities of bone healing, we developed two complementary models. With thefirst we want to explain the spatio-temporal patterns of dif-ferent tissues as observed experimentally using simplemechanobiological rules. The essence of these rules is athreshold of the mechanical stimulus, below which eithercartilage or bone is formed, or bone resorption starts. Themodel considers the strong mechanical heterogeneity of thenewly formed bone [7]. The simulated tissue patterns are compared with a succession of six images obtained from his-tological sections of a sheep experiment performed at theJulius Wolff Institute, Charit\u00e9. Best agreement with theexperiments is obtained when the volumetric strain isassumed as mechanical stimulus [8]. Intermediate stages of the healing process are strongly influenced by the stochasticinfluences on the control. In a separate study, the samemechanobiological rules could explain the asymmetric devel-opment of the bony callus on the inner (medial) and outer (lat-eral) side [9]. With the second more generic model we ask the ques- tion which factors in the local control determine, whetherhealing occurs directly or indirectly. The mechanical stimulusis assumed to be a combination of the local mechanicalstrain and the local stiffness of the material. Healing occurswhen the stimulus is within a predefined window. For thecase that the size of the window is strongly restricted, thesimulations show that indirect healing is preferred. R. Weinkamer , D. Fix, P .

This means they are bound to a certain location in a given environment. To be successful under these circumstances, plants have developed so phis ticated strate- gies which are typi cally re flected in the material forming the plant body. A plant is com posed of different tissues which them- selves consist of cells, each of them en cased by a more or less rigid polymeric cell wall ( Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1: Wood, an example for a plant forming material. The inserted cross section (A) shows alternating layers of earlywood and latewood(tissue) and excentric growth due to reaction wood formation. SEMimages show reaction wood, here tension wood (B) and normal wood (C),cell wall cartoons depict proposed cell wall structure of (D) tensionwood and (E) normal wood (black lines indicate the orientation of cellu-lose fibrils in the different cell wall layers. Our research interests are plant material structure, (mechan- ical) properties, the function for the plant and how and/orwhether the environment is reflected in the material. Select-ed plant systems are/will be studied in detail. In terms ofapplications, revealed material optimization strategies forcertain functions could be used for the development of newmaterials. Furthermore a deeper understanding of plantbased material is essential for sustainable and targeted useof the abundant resource plant material.Plant Cell Wall PropertiesKnowledge about cell wall structure is essential to under-stand plant material. A growing cell is surrounded by a pri-mary cell wall which is both flexible enough to allow cellexpansion and mechanically stable to resist internal andexternal forces. After cessation of growth, many cells formadditional layers, the mechanically robust secondary cell walls.Cell walls in general can be seen as fibre-reinforced struc-tures: stiff and strong cellulose fibrils are embedded in amore pliant hemicellulose-pectin matrix (primary cell walls)or in a hemicellulose-lignin matrix (secondary cell wall). Thearrangement of the stiff cellulose fibrils determines cell wallmechanics and anisotropy to a large extent. Still, both the pro -cesses of cellulose synthesis and the arrangement of cellu-lose fibrils in growing cells is not fully understood yet. Oneoutcome of the research activities on the model plant systemArabidopsis thaliana is the availability of numerous cell wallmutants. Structural and mechanical investigations of their darkgrown hypocotyls are a promising approach to a deeper under -standing of primary cell wall formation, structure and finallycell growth. However, detailed knowledge on the hypo cotylproperties of wildtype plants, especially on how they changewith hypocotyl growth (age) is essential. We made structural and mechanical investigations on 4,5,6 and 7 day old dark grown hypocotyls ( Fig. 2 ). The cellu- lose orientation in different regions along the hypo cotyl wasstudied by a newly developed synchrotron X-ray method, themechanical properties in the lower region of hypocotyls wasdetermined by microtensile tests [1]. In the future these methods will be applied to study hypocotyls with targetedmodification (in collaboration Diploma in Wood Science and Technology (BOKU - University of Natural Resources and Applied LifeSciences, Vienna, Austria)2007: Doctoral Thesis: Structure, prop- erties Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces.Since 09/2011: Research Group Leader, Department of Biomaterials, Max Planck Institute of Colloids and InterfacesPlant Material Adaptation Fig. 2: Structural and mechanical studies on Arabidopsis hypocotyls (A), x-ray diffractograms of the apical hook (B) and ~ 5 mm below (C), diagram showing microfibril angle distribution (D).

To study the mechanically more robust secondary cell walls we apply a multitude of different methods, eg. [2,3]. An exam- ple for an interesting secondary cell wall system which westarted to investigate in more detail is given below: Plants and Fire - Storage and Protection of Banksia Seeds in FolliclesSo-called serotinous plants are seen in some fire-prone envi-ronments. The term \"serotiny\" describes the trait to retainmature seeds on the plant instead of releasing them. Theplant benefits from increased competitiveness after fire: amassive seed stock is released at once into the post-firenutrient-rich soil. Prominent examples for this plant trait arespecies of the ancient Australian genus Banksia: seeds canbe stored for more than 15 years in woody follicles ( Fig. 3 ) on shrub- or tree-like plants with species-dependent triggers foropening, ranging from very high temperatures, to a combina-tion of heat plus cyclic wetting and drying. To be a beneficial(adaptive) functional trait these follicles must meet at leasttwo requirements (i) seed protection for long periods de -manding (structural) stability against weathering, microor-ganisms and animals and (ii) the ability to open rapidly uponthe appropriate environmental trigger or disturbance, mostcommonly fire.

Many biological materials have excellent mechanical properties and they often show unique capabilities such as the ability to re - generate. Thereby the material is adapted to environmental conditions at all hierarchi- cal levels by the activity of cells. In our group, we use specific combinations of materials sci- ence methods to answer biologically driven ques- tions. We characterize biological materials at various levels, from the nano- to the centimeter range. In our re - search, bone serves as prototypical system for a hierarchical-ly structured biological material. It can be considered as acomposite material, consisting of collagen I molecules andmineral particles at the nanometer scale [1]. The research on bone is performed in cooperation with partners from theJulius Wolff Institute at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin as well as theLudwig Boltzmann Institute of Osteology in Vienna, Austria. Furthermore, we investigate specific properties and basic formation mechanisms of synthetically produced complexma terials and compare them with those of biological materials. Our central experimental methods are X-ray scattering (SAXS, WAXS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray we useour lab sources as well as synchrotrons, in particular the MPI\u00b5spot beamline at BESSY II (Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin f\u00fcrMaterialien und Energie, Berlin Adlershof). Bone Formation and Healing Bone formation takes usually place in two stages. First, arather unorganized bone tissue (woven bone) is generated bybone-forming osteoblasts. Second, lamellar bone grows ontop of the woven bone and partially replaces it. Hence, intra -membranous bone formation requires an intermediate step inwhich bone with a lower degree of orientation serves as asubstrate for osteoblasts [2]. This is followed by a coopera- tive action of osteoblasts resulting in the deposition of lamel-lar tissue. During bone formation some of the osteoblasts getembedded within the collagen matrix and differentiate there-by into osteocytes. They are then located in cavities calledlacunae, and form cell processes within small tubes (canali-culi). These structures form a dense network through the en -tire bone matrix representing a fingerprint of bone formation, as the position of osteoblasts during the embedding can be deduced. In Fig. 1a , the osteocyte network of plexiform sheep bone shows a layer with a relatively small amount of wovenbone surrounded by layers of lamellar bone. These structures can be very well visualized with CLSM [2], which enables the interpretation of the bone forming process. A similar two-step process like in bone formation was also found during bone healing in a sheep callus [3]. To ex plore if this process during bone healing can be generalized we cur-rently investigate also the material structure in small animal (rat and mouse) osteotomy models [4]. In a study on ovine bone with a critical size defect filled with a porous scaffold, we find that the scaffold architecture guides new tissue formation [5]. At first, the scaffold supports the formation of a structu redfibrous tissue across the defect. This fibrous network guidesthe mineralization process and consequently enables boneingrowth into a critical-sized defect. Fig. 1: Structure and properties of plexiform ovine bone. (a) CLSM image showing compact bone. Areas with a lower degree of orientation in themiddle are surrounded by lamellar layers, represented by an orientedarrangement of osteocyte lacunae and canaliculi.

(c) Correlation of mineral particle thickness (T-parameter) with the distance of these mineral particles to the cell net-work. The T-parameters shows a bimodal distribution in relation to thedifferent bone areas. The Role of Osteocytes in Bone In bone, the physical properties of the extracellular matrix areclosely correlated with cell functions. Osteocytes are knownto orchestrate bone remodeling, but their precise role duringmineral homeostasis and its potential impact on the qualityof the bone material is not yet fully understood. To understandthe interaction of the extracellular matrix with osteocytes weexamined the network organization with respect to the prop-erties of the surrounding material [6]. The osteocyte network was visualized by CLSM and characterized by topologicallyquantifying the distance of the bone matrix from the cell net-work (lacunae and canaliculi). By means ESRF, Grenoble, France) we determi -ned the size and arrangement of mineral particles in the samebone sections. Fig. 1b shows the size (T-parameter in nm) of mineral particles in relation to the geometry of the osteocytenetwork. An important finding in this study was that theseproperties depend on the distance to the cell network ( Fig. 1c ). The most surprising insight was that the majority of the miner-al particles reside within less than one micrometer from thenearest cell network channel. By this combination of re -search methods it could be shown that the osteocytes havepotential access to a vast reservoir of minerals in the boneand therefore might contribute to the mineral homeostasis [6]. 44 Wagermaier 19.06.1974 2001: Diploma, Material Research Center, Center for Biomaterial Development, Teltow)Since 2009: Group Leader (Max Planck Institute and Potsdam) References: K. and M\u00f6ller, M.

Our results revealed strong differences in size and orientation of the mineral particles between fetaland postnatal bone, with bulkier, randomly oriented particlesat the fetal stage, and highly aligned, much longer particlesafter birth. Fig. 2 shows the amount of hydroxyapatite (HA-002- peak area) in fetal and postnatal samples measured byWAXS as a function of the calcium content determined byXRF. The correlation between HA and calcium is not linearand a linear regression of the fetal data (dashed line) revealsa calcium offset. This leads to the interesting observationthat the tissue at all stages of development contains morecalcium than is present in hydroxyapatite. Fig. 2: Comparison of the WAXS (amount of hydroxyapatite, HA-002- peak area) and XRF (calcium content) data for two representative fetalsamples, F16.5 (open squares, open circles) and one representative post-natal sample, P1 (closed circles). The plot shows the amount of hydrox-yapatite (HA-002-peak area) as a function of the calcium content. Currently we are investigating medullary bone which serves as model system for rapid bone turnover rates as it is a calci-um source for daily egg shell formation in hens [8]. One of the main discoveries there is that there are three different bonetypes. Additionally to the two known bone types (cortical and medullary bone) a third type (termed 'nebular bone') has beendiscovered, which may represent an intermediate phase dur- ing mineralization. Understanding the structure of medullarybone at different points in time during egg shell formation might be a key to gain further insights into mineralizationmecha nisms in bone. Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic mutation resul - ting directly in a disturbed collagen formation and indirectlyin a disordered bone with increased bone fragility, low bone mass, impaired bone material properties and unusually high bone matrix mineralization. In human bone of children, we com pared the mineral crystal size in OI with a control groupand found that the increase in mineral density in OI is not due to an increase in particle size, but due to an increase in the number of particles [9].Microlens Arrays with Uniform Size and Focal LengthBiomineralized tissues, such as sea shells and bones, grow ina genetically programmed way to obtain specific composi-tions and shapes, which define their unique functionalities.The growth of biominerals usually takes place in aqueousmedia at ambient conditions. While such natural systemsand processes are usually very complex, tailor-made modelsystems can be used to explore basic processes. We devel-oped a simple synthesis of unique micro-optical devices:microlens arrays [10]. Fig. 3: Morphology and optical properties of the microlens arrays.

The formation process is regulated by an organ- ic surfactant whose amphiphilic molecules play a crucial roleat the early stage of self-assembly. Within one to two hoursmicrometer-sized CaCO 3structures with hemisphe rical shape and uniform size are formed as a thin film on the surface of thesolution ( Fig. 3a and b ). By means of light microscopy multiple images of a micron-sized 'A' could be projected through thearray of microlenses, proofing that the hemispherical CaCO 3 structures work as micron-sized convex lenses ( Fig. 3c and d ). project the biocompatibility of the CaCO 3microlens arrays was demonstrated by seeding fibroblasts on the array( Fig. 3e ). The study was performed at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam and is a joined workwith KAIST in South Korea. W. Wagermaier , G. Benecke, R. Hoerth, M. Kerschnitzki, C.

Amorphous Calcium Carbonate/ Calcium Phosphate Mixtures Many of the most complex mineral struc- tures found in nature are not from geologi- cal origin, but are the result of biological processes. Examples are vertebrate bones or invertebrate exoskeletons, where a mineral phase (calcium phosphate/calcium carbonate) is in close contact with an organic matrix composed of either collagen or chitin. Recent developments show indica- tions that the mineralization of, what is initially a fully organ-ic matrix, is governed by the attachment of spherical, sub-micron to nm-sized mineral particles that are amorphous neighboring matrix-forming cells. Inmost cases, this amorphous phase crystallizes in the finalmineral structure, however, in some cases the amorphousnature is retained. The high stability of such amorphous bio-minerals against crystallization is remarkable and requiresfurther understanding. From in vitro experiments we know that highly charged polymers [1], phosphorylated proteins, small organic molecules or inorganic impurities are able todelay the nucleation of a crystalline phase or even stabilizean amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) or calcium phosphate(ACP) ( Fig. 1 ). However, the more complex the stabilizing agent gets, the less we know about the actual mechanism.Furthermore, the influence of these agents on the local phys-ical conditions of the reaction medium (pH, ionic strength,depletion of ions) is often underestimated, making it atedious job to extract trustworthy mechanistic data. To deepen the present understanding on the stability of some biomimetic amorphous minerals, in our research we arefocusing on 1 special characteristic of many stable amor-phous calcium carbonates, which is the presence of (largeamounts of) inorganic phosphate. In line with the proposedinfluence of Mg 2+on calcium carbonate mineralization, next to a possible mismatch in charge (3+ instead of 2+) the largetetrahedral phosphate groups impose a structural mismatchwith the planar CO 32-in the final crystalline calcium carbon- ate. The procedure we apply is to: 1) prepare amorphous cal-cium carbonate/calcium phosphate mixtures with variousbiologically relevant compositions 2) investigate the efficien-cy of mixing between carbonate/phosphate groups and 3)investigate the stability of the prepared amorphous material.Here, results from step 2) and 3) are used to optimize the syn-thesis method, thereby providing us detailed information onthe conditions necessary to obtain a perfectly mixed ACC/ACP . Furthermore, by varying the ratio between ACC andACP we can relate the stability of a certain mixture to itschemical composition. Finally, we can compare the specificACC/ACP mixtures with their biological analogues, telling us more about the origin of their stability. In all steps of the research there is a close cooperation with the Department ofStructural Biological of the Weizmann Institute ( Assaf Gal, Lia Addadi ).Synthesis synthesis methods for amorphous calcium carbonateand amorphous calcium phosphate have been described.Most of them rely on the formation of an instant high super-saturation with respect to the crystalline phase, thereby pro-voking the formation of the metastable, amorphous precursorusing a simple two-pot synthesis. The extended lifetime ofthese materials enables the collection of a rather stabledried amorphous phase after carefully extracting the samplefrom the reaction solution. Using such a preparation method,initial investigation shows that an amorphous phase withchemical and physical properties in Raman-spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and morphology (SEM), which are intermedi-ate between ACC and ACP , is easily obtained. However, thismethod doesn't allow us to control the physical conditions inthe reaction medium in a great extent and furthermore raisesquestions whether the sample collection doesn't change thestructure or chemistry of the ACC/ACP mixture. Therefore, to control and monitor crucial parameters dur- ing the formation of the ACC/ACP phase like the pH and con-centration of Ca 2+, a titration setup will be applied [1,2]. Fur- thermore, in addition to analysis performed on extractedsamples, analysis of the mineral phase inside the reactionmedium will be performed as earlier described for the nucle-ation of calcium phosphates [2].

Besides being tailored at thehigher hierarchical levels to bear and distribute loads, thesetissues are carefully designed to optimize the interactions oftheir molecular/macromolecular components with water toobtain desired properties/behaviors on which biologicalorganisms rely to accomplish their vital functions. In many tis-sues, in fact, the chemistry of the constituents drives waterabsorption that, thanks to the peculiar arrangement of themacromolecular components or to their structure, results inanisotropic volume changes (swelling). This swelling and de-swelling has been shown to generate complex (ametabolic)movements that are exploited in nature for different aims:swimming of the wheat awns [1], opening of pine and spruce cones[2]or plant seeds dispersal units during rain in arid regions.[3]In a similar way, swelling is responsible for growth stresses in trees to compensate for the load of branches or ofside winds. [4]Biological materials act then as structure medi- ated, chemo-mechanical energy converter, as they are able toexploit molecular forces to generate mechanical energy. Of particular interest for me is: \u00b7 to understand and describe molecular interactions in such complex materials, \u00b7 to set thermodynamic models able to describe the structure mediated chemomechanical energy conversion, \u00b7 to image, at the microscopic level, water sorption and water/ tissues interactions in heterogeneous biological materials. Molecular InteractionsTypically, biological materials are very complex, but they canbe described as a collection of primary building blocks regu-larly arranged at the various hierarchical levels. Their charac-teristic size lies in the nanometric range and they are usuallyseparated by few nm. Because of these reasons, a variety ofinteractions occur at the molecular level between the con-stituents of the tissues or between these latter and the sol-vent molecules. Typical examples are hydration forces, asso-ciated to the particular structure of water when confined tovery small spaces (typically sub-nanometric) between twosurfaces, Van der Waals interactions, entropic forces, H-Bondsetc... One goal of my research is to describe, starting from a chemical and structural description of the biological nano - compoisites and considering the hierarchical arrangement,which of those interactions play a critical role in the hydra- tion processes and how these forces are varying as a func-tion of the amount of solvent taken up. Mainly my work focuses on plants tissues: in collaboration with prof. Thomas Zemb (ICSM - Marcoule), a model describing the equation of state for wood has been set, and, in collaboration with for- mer groups (I. Burgert) and the group of John Dunlop, a chem- ical description of the opening of the seed dispersal units ofthe ice plant has been proposed. Additionally, I study the hydration of collagenand other protein based fibers [5,6](in collab- oration with Dr. Admir Masic) and (biomi calcium phosphates) and water. [7] Chemomechanical Energy ConversionOnce the molecular forces driving water sorptionare described, the continuum mechanics can be usedto express the changes of mechanical energy with the dimen-sional changes the materials undergoes when taking up sol-vent. In this way, using the gas/liquid or liquid/liquid phaseequilibrium thermodynamics, an ab initio model predicting theequilibrium stresses/strains the structure can produce, underdesired geometrical/mechanical constraints and for givenchanges in the chemical potential of the solvent, can be set. At the same time, the predictions of the model are com- pared with in situ experimental data. Water Sorption ImagingFinally, as the natural tissues are often heterogeneous at themicro/nanometric scale, I lately started to develop, in collabora -tion with Dr. Breitenstein of the Max Planck Institute of Micro -structure Physics in Halle, a technique based on Infrared Lock-In Thermography to spatially resolve and image water sorptionsites, water sorption kinetics and possibly water/matrix bindingenergies in the aforementioned tissues ( Fig. 1 ).

Nature thus not only provides us with inspiration for designing new materials but also teaches us how to use soft molecules such as proteins to tune interparticle and external forces to structure and assemble simple building blocks into func- tional entities. Magnetotactic bacteria and their chain of magneto- somes (Fig. 1 ) represent a striking example of such an accom- plishment where a very simple living organism precisely con- trols the properties of inorganics via organics and at thenanometer-scale to form a single magnetic dipole that pas-sively orients the cell in the Earth magnetic field lines [1, 2]. In my group, we have thus developed a bio-inspired researchbased on magnetotactic bacteria. This research combines therecent developments of nanoscale engineering in the chemi-cal science, the latest advances in molecular biology togeth-er with modern progresses in physical analysis. My researchthus focuses at the interface between chemistry, materialsscience, physics, and biology to understand how biologicalsystems synthesize, organize and use minerals, and to applythe design principles to sustainably form hierarchical materi-als with controlled properties that can be used e.g. as mag-netically directed nanodevices towards applications in sens-ing, actuating, and transport.

Biological Materials Magnetosomes: Hierarchy at the Structural Level The biomineralization of the mineral magnetite inside the magnetosome organelle together with the chain formation in magnetotactic bacteria are two processes that are highly controlled at the cellular level in order to form cellular mag-netic dipoles. The smallest building block in this hierarchical structure is the magnetosome crystal. However, only contro-versial results about its micro-structure were obtained so far, partly because of the very limited amount of materials avail- able. Thereby, the influence of the ultrastructure in the for-mation of the magnetic dipole i.e. on the function of theassembly is also to be specified. We have thus investigated the structure of the magneto- somes using were magne-tosomes bacteria and isolatedones ( ). Through comparison with synthetic nanoparti- cles (abiotic control materials) of similar size, we showedthat this difference could be associated with different oxida-tion states and that the biogenic magnetite was stoichiomet-ric, i.e. structurally pure. However, as soon as the magneto-somes were isolated from the cells, oxidation took place. We thus proposed that the hierarchical structuring of the magnetosome chain starts with the formation of structurallypure magnetite nanoparticles. In addition, this property canbe directly connected with the magnetic property of the mag-netosome chains where it is of advantage for the cell to formstructurally pure magnetite crystals for optimal magneticresponse.

Remarkable peak shift membrane (MAG+MMand MAG-MM) and Magnetosomes Chains: Hierarchy at the Chain Level Magnetotactic bacteria benefit from their ability to form cellu-lar magnetic dipoles by assembling stable single-domain fer-romagnetic particles in chains as a means to navigate alongEarth's magnetic field lines on their way to favourable habi-tats. After studying the smallest building-blocks, i.e. the mag-netosomes and their ultrastructure, we studied their assemblyby a combined experimental and theoretical appro ach [4, 5]. A number of genetic factors involved in the controlled assemblyof these magnetosome chains have been identified in recentyears, but we have addressed how the specific biological reg-ulation is coordinated with general physical processes. 48 Damien Faivre 03.10.1977 2001: Master, fundamental and applied geochemistry (Institute of Earth Physics and University Denis Diderot, Paris)Thesis: Effect of formation conditions onthe geochemical properties ofmagnetite nanocrystals2004: PhD, fundamental and applied Denis Diderot,Paris)Thesis: Kinetics, mineralogy, andisotopic properties of magnetitenanoparticles determinationof biogenicity 2007: Group Leader Biomaterials Department, (Max Institute ofColloids Interfaces, Potsdam)Since 2011: ERC Group LeaderMagnetite Formation and OrganizationBIOLOGICAL AND BIO-INSPIRED MATERIALS The simulations indicate that physical processes of magneto- some diffusion, guided by their magnetic interactions, are notsufficient for the chain formation observed experimentally. Inturn, they suggest that biologically encoded active move-ments of magnetosomes may be required. Not surprisingly,the chain pattern is most resembling experimental resultswhen both magnetic interactions and active movement arecoordinated ( Fig. 3 ). In addition, we estimate that the force such active trans- port has to generate is compatible with forces generated bythe polymerization or depolymerization of cytoskeletal fila-ments. The simulations suggest that the pleiotropic pheno-types of mamK deletion strains may be due to a defect in activemotility of magnetosomes and that crystal formation in magne-tosome vesicles is coupled to the activation of their activemotility in M. gryphiswaldense , but not in M. magneticum .

(Fig. Materials Magnetite Nanoparticles: Studying the Nucleation and Growth of Nanoparticles The formation of crystalline materials from solution is typically described by the nucleation and growth theory, where atoms or molecules assemble directly in and from solution. For various systems however, the formation of the thermodynamically sta- ble mineral is preceded by intermediate phase(s). More com- plex pathways have recently been proposed, such as aggrega- tional processes of nanoparticle precursors or pre-nucleation clusters, which seem to contradict the classical theory. Multiple synthetic routes for the production of magnetite nanoparticles have been reported in the literature. Indeed, the ferrimagnetic properties of such particles are increasingly exploited in bio- and nanotechnological applications. Howev-er, the formation mechanism has remained unclear. We havedeveloped a set-up for the controlled growth of magnetite particle in vitro [6]. We can reach average particle dimensionof 50 nm ( Fig. 4 ), and thereby control the magnetic properties of the particles, changing from superparamagnetic for parti-cles smaller than 25 nm to stable single domain for particleslarger than 25 nm. We are thus able to synthetically reachparticle size so far only attainable by biological synthesis. We further have studied the mechanism of such forma- tion by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy [7]. We found out that the nucleation and the growth of magnetiteproceeds through rapid agglomeration of nanometric primaryparticles and that no intermediate amorphous bulk precursorphase is involved. We also demonstrate that these observa-tions can be described within the framework of classicalnucleation theory. Fig. 4: TEM image of a large synthetic magnetite nanoparticle. Biomimetic Chains: Towards Hierarchy in a Semi-Synthetic SystemHierarchical structuring of single particles can lead to the for-mation of multifunctional materials. We are thus are inter-ested in the biomimetic arrangement of the magnetic parti-cles we form in vitro . MamK is a such as MreB and ParM. With littleor no information on the structural and behavioural charac-teristics of MamK outside the cell, the mamK gene fromMagnetospirillium gryphiswaldense was cloned and expres - sed to better understand the differences in the cytoskeletalproperties with its bacterial homologues [8]. Despite the low sequence identity shared between MamK and MreB (22%) and actin (18%), the behavior ofMamK monitored by light scattering broadly mirrored that ofits bacterial cousin MreB. The broad size variability of MamKfilaments revealed by light scattering studies was supportedby transmission electron microscopy imaging. Filament mor-phology however, indicated that MamK conformed to linearlyorientated filaments that appeared to be distinctly dissimilarcompared to MreB suggesting functional differences betweenthese homologues.

Biological materials, in addition to having remarkable physical property combinations such as high toughness and stiffness, can also change shape and volume. These shape and volume changes allow organisms to form new tissue during growth and morpho- genesis, as well as to repair and remodel old tissues. In addition shape or volume changes in an existing tissue can lead to useful motion or force generation (actuation) that may even still function in the dead organism. Both growth and actuation of tissues aremediated, in addition to biochemical factors, by the physicalconstraints of the surrounding environment and the architec-ture of the underlying tissue. This research group combines experimental and theoret- ical methods to understand how tissue architecture andexternal physical constraints interact to control firstly tissuegrowth and secondly tissue actuation. The work on tissue growth was done in collaboration with: M. Rumpler , Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for , and E. Gamsj\u00e4ger , Uni. Leoben, C. Werner and co-workers at the Max Bergmann Institute, Dres- den, and A. Petersen and co-workers at the Julius Wolff Insti- tute, Berlin. The work on actuation was done in collaborationwith I. Burgert , now at the ETH - Zurich, R. Elbaum and Y. Abraham , Hebrew Uni. Jerusalem, Y. Br\u00e9chet , INP-Grenoble, T G. Zickler, Ionov and co-work- ers at the Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research, Dresden. Using Geometry to Direct Tissue Growth Previous research in the group has shown that the shape ofthe surrounding environment can have a surprising influenceon the rate of tissue formation [1]. 3D-printing techniques allow the production of pores with controlled surface geome-tries which can then be tested in tissue culture. The experi-mentally measured growth rates were shown to be propor-tional to the local surface curvature, meaning that despitethe cells small size, collectively cells can measure geome-tries at length scales much larger than themselves. Theseobservations can be readily implemented in a simple 2D com-puter model for curvature driven growth [2,3], and give excel- lent predictions for the position of the tissue interface as afunction of time ( Fig. 1 ). Furthermore this model was also used to determine optimal pore shapes for tissue engineeringapplications [3].Fig. 1: Comparison between experimentally measured interfaces and predicted interfaces as a function of time in circular pores and semi-circular channels [2]. Despite the success of this simple geometric model in describing growth, it is difficult to directly link to it the mech-anisms responsible for growth at the cellular scale. It seemslikely that mechanical stresses developed by the cells them-selves are responsible for the tissue patterning observed [1]. Inspired by the observation of high contractile stresses in thetissue surface, we have also been developing, together withE. Gamsj\u00e4ger and F. D. Fischer (Uni. Leoben), a more complex model for tissue growth. This model takes into account boththe stresses induced by confined growth as well as the stressinduced by a contractile layer of cells on the surface [4], and is successful in describing the asymmetric response of cellsto the sign of curvature. Fig. 2: A) An oblique view of the 3D actin architecture of tissue formed in the corner of a pore. The circles highlight the double curvature pro-duced during growth. B) Result of the 3D curvature driven growth simu-lation in a cross-shaped pore. The 3D nature of the tissue formed in the scaffolds has up till now been neglected, as the pores studied up till now havestraight sides (they are prismatic), meaning one of the princi-ple curvatures of the starting interface is always zero. 3Dimaging methods, as illustrated in ( Fig. 2A ), show that due to growth the tissue develops a double curvature, with positiveand negative mean curvatures, which may in turn influence 50 BIOLOGICAL AND BIO-INSPIRED MATERIALS John Dunlop 06.04.1978 1996-2001: Bachelor of Science (1st Class Honours)majoring in Chemistry Bachelor of Engineering (1st Class Honours) majoring in Materials EngineeringUniversity of Western Australia (Perth, Australia) 2002-2005: Doctoral Thesis: Internal variable modelling 2007: Alexander von Humboldt Fellow Since 11/2008: Research Group Leader Department of Biomaterials, Max PlanckInstitute of Colloids and InterfacesBiomimetic Actuation and Tissue Growth the overall curvature driven growth. As such the 2D geomet- ric model has been extended to 3D ( Fig. 2B ). In this model, much akin to the Laplace law, the mean surface curvature istaken as the driving force for growth. Using Geometry to Direct Actuation Plants move their organs during their lifetime via active bio-logical processes such as differential growth, or activechanges in osmotic pressure exemplified by the fast closingof the Venus-fly trap. In addition to this some organs mayalso move after death due to the swelling of tissues uponhydration/dehydration. Such hygroscopic actuation is con-trolled solely by the clever arrangement of swellable andnon-swellable tissues, and in principle can be readily copiedby the Engineer. Many examples of such pre-programmedshape changes can be found in structures related to seed-propagation, such as in the awns of many seeds, or in theopening mechanisms of a variety of seed capsules (See alsothe work being done on Banksia in the Plant Adaptationgroup of M. Eder ). The twisting/untwisting movement of the awns of Erodium gruinum for example [5]propel the seeds along and into the ground. This is controlled by the complexarrangement of tilted spirals cellulose microfibrils inside thecell walls. Similarly the awns of wheat also move uponhumidity changes, with the rapid response to humiditychanges thought to be accelerated by swelling induced poreopening [6]. The opening of the ice-plant seed capsule was studied by M. Harrington and I. Burgert [7], and was shown to be controlled by hygroscopic keels consisting of diamond-honeycombs filled with a swellable cellulose-like gel ( Fig. 3A). Such a honeycomb like structure converts the isotropic swelling into a strongly anisotropic response, which may beinteresting in the design of artificial actuators. Fig. 3: A) Schematic of swelling of a diamond-honeycomb upon pressure changes in the cells, akin to what is observed in the ice-plant [7]. B)Simulated actuation strains in a diamond honeycomb as a function ofpressure and cell-wall modulus.Surprisingly despite the simplicity of such a pressurised hon- eycomb, very little work has been done on modelling it'smechanical properties. By combining Finite Element (FE)methods with micromechanical modelling it is possible todevelop maps of actuation response as a function of actua-tion pressure, material properties and architecture ( Fig. 3B ). Further work is underway together with J. Weaver (Wyss Institute, Boston) to produce working mechanical prototypesof these systems using the latest generation multi-material3D printer. Initial testing has begun on linear structures withextrude-able cross-sections simulated previously [8]. Fig. 4: Simulated rolling and folding of three actuating bilayers with dif- ferent aspect ratios attached to a partially adherent substrate [9]. Despite their apparent simplicity, bilayer structures can pro- duce quite complex motion [9,10] , depending on their shape. In a collaboration with the experimental group of L. Ionov (Leibnitz Institute, Dresden) we have been using FE simula-tions to understand the role of external shape on how activepolymeric bilayers attached to a substrate unpeel and fold.( Fig. 4 ) illustrates some examples of simulations carried out on layers with different aspect ratios. This illustrate the com-petition in all-side rolling observed in low aspect ratio sys-tems compared to the one side rolling seen in more elongat-ed structures. One surprising output of the model was theprediction of wrinkling in early stages of rolling that was sub-sequently confirmed in the experiments. More recent experi-ments by the Dresden group on star-like shapes led to thedevelopment of a set of simple design rules for folding [10], supported by our mechanical simulations. Further work needsto be done to address the problems of kinetics, or the rate ofshape change and to include these effects in our models. J. Dunlop , C. Bidan, A. J. C., Fratzl, P .

The approach is trans- disciplinary and interactive between the groups in the department that cover different areas of expertise. The core focus is the devel- opment of synthetic methods for the chemical synthesis of defined oligosaccharides. The com- pounds are the basis for chemical tools that aided bioche - mical investigations into the fundamental roles complex carbohydrates play in biological processes that underlie dis- ease. The findings helped create diagnostic carbohydratearrays to begin to understand immunological aspects of infectious disease epidemiology. Vaccine development of several glycoconjugate vaccine candidates is rapidly advanc-ing towards clinical trials. In the past four years the Depart-ment has developed by the addition of several new groupsfollowing the move from ETH Zurich in 2009. Glycan sequenc-ing and glycomics (Dr. Kolarich) helps to identify glycans ofbiological importance particularly on interfaces of the humanbody - skin and intestine. The role of glycans is assed (Dr. Lepenies, glycoimmunology) using particularly animal modelsof infectious diseases (glycobiology and vaccinology (Dr.Anish). We are actively pursuing different questions in theglycosciences including the structure, function and biologicalrole of sugars found on the surface of mammalian and bacte-rial cells particularly in the areas of immunology, biochem-istry and human disease. Materials aspects related to carbohydrates are continu- ing to be pursued in the department. The Emmy-Noethergroup of Dr. Hartmann is producing well-defined polymers andcollaborates closely with the glycoimmunologists to assessthe in vivoactivity of complex synthetic molecules. Our in - creased interest in establishing structure-function correla-tions of glycans is expressed by the addition of the Emmy-Noether group of Dr. C. Rademacher in 2012. This group isconcerned with questions relating to structural immunologyand as such forms a bridge between the synthetic chemists,glycobiologists and glycoimmunologists. The increasing im -por tance of continuous-flow synthesis has been addressed byadding a new member of the Department, Prof. Dr. T.McQuade an expert in this area who joined us in May 2012. The department is engaged in collaborations with the Colloid Department concerning the synthesis of colloidalpolymers and supported catalysts. Many other applications of the flow paradigm from organic to nanoparticle synthesis and polymer chemistry are currently progressing rapidly.Automated Synthesis of CarbohydratesSince our arrival at the institute, we have expanded thescope of our core technology - the automated oligosaccha-ride synthesizer. After streamlining the process and inventingnew linkers as well as a set of \"approved\" building blocks,the first demonstrator model of a new synthesizer has beencompleted. This new synthesizer is entering service in early2013. Thus, the Department is closing in on the ultimate goalof creating a commercially available instrument that uses adefined set of monosaccharide building blocks to assemblemost oligosaccharides reliably. Automated synthesis has allowed us to set a new world record by assembling a 30-mer oligosaccharide. After morethan ten years of work, the automated synthesis of gly-cosaminoglycans has become possible. Currently, differentmembers of this class of biologically extremely importantoligosaccharides such as chondroitin sulfate heparin opencompletely new areas for biology but also material sciences. Synthetic Tools for Glycobiology Access to synthetic oligosaccharides has given fibers as well as inor-ganic materials such as quantum dots and zeolithes. Thesetools are now commonly used by the glycobiologists in thedepartment to elucidate fundamental processes such as theentry mechanism of parasites into host cells. Synthetic Carbohydrate Vaccines We have established a comprehensive program targeting thedevelopment of fully synthetic carbohydrate vaccines. Ourcommitment is evidenced by the addition of an additionalgroup leader (Dr. C. Pereira) who is in charge of vaccinechemistry. This team is currently producing a host of antigensfound on the surface of pathogenic bacteria. Conjugation andanalysis of the antigens is now routinely performed as areimmunological and functional studies in several diseasemodels in experimental animals. Our integrated in-houseapproach has accelerated the development of importantimmunological tools as well as vaccine development. Research in the Department of Biomolecular Systems Peter H.

Glycosylat-ed-fullerenols have surprising activity against neurologicaldamage in a stroke model in rats. Further preclinical studiesare currently underway. The past two years have seen newprojects focused at in vivoimaging using a new tridentate ligand system we have developed for carbohydrate labeling.With this approach we have monitored the distribution ofspecific oligosaccharides in animla models of disease. Glycoimmunology Carbohydrate recognition by C-type lectin receptors influ-ences key functions of dendritic cells such as antigen presen-tation, cytokine release, and the expression of co-stimulatorymolecules. Since all of these processes impact T cell primingand differentiation, CLR targeting is a means to orchestratean initiated immune response. Recently, in collaboration withthe MPI-DKTS in Magdeburg we investigated the impact ofhemagglutinin (HA) on influenza virus immuno genicity. Virus deglycosylation dramatically decreasedcytokine production by spleen cells and reduced HA-specificantibody responses upon immunization of mice indicating acrucial role of HA N-glycosylation for immunogenicity. To identify immune stimulatory and immune modulatory CLR ligands, a screening platform has been developed, fol-lowed by in vitroand in vivoassays. The extracellular domains of different CLRs were expressed as fusion proteinsand used in conjunction with the glycan array technology forhigh-throughput screening of lectin/carbohydrate interac-tions. Novel binding partners of CLRs were identified andinteractions with known ligands confirmed. Carbohydrate-protein interactions were further characterized by surfaceplasmon resonance (SPR) measurements. This platformbrings together CLR ligand identification and their immuno-logic evaluation. Hence, it is a highly useful tool for the func-tional analysis of CLR ligands.Carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactionsAs part of the Collaborative Research Centre (SFB) 765 (\"Mul-tivalency as chemical organization and action principle\"), wefocus on the characterization of carbohydrate-carbohydrateinteractions. Interactions between carbohydrates are evenweaker than carbohydrate/lectin interactions, thus are oftenhardly measureable. In this context we focus on biophysicaland biological analyses of interactions between the tumor-specific carbohydrate antigens GM3 and Gg3 as well as GB4and GalGB4. Currently, we investigate whether these multi-valent carbohydrate interactions are suitable for cell-specifictargeting and imaging. Continous Flow Microreactors as Tools for Organic ChemistsAfter pioneering the use of continuous flow microreactors foruse by synthetic organic chemists more than ten years ago,the department is now utilizing continuous flow to addressdifferent chemical problems. In 2012 the most high profileproject was the continuous synthesis of the anti-malarialcompound artemisinin using photochemistry. His project hasresulted in the formation of a spin-off company \"ArtemiFlow\"that is scaling the synthesis to ton scale and is working withinternational organizations to bring the scientific advance tobear on the production of the drug. With the addition of Prof. Tyler McQuade to the depart- ment an additional focus is placed on the production ofgeneric drugs using the benefits of flow synthesis. In addi-tion, different chemistries ranging from gold-catalyzed glyco-sylations to transition mediated photochemistry to polymer-izations are pursued. Peter H.

Challenges in Simu-lation Studies of 5556Sequencing and synthesis of peptides and oligonucleotides have been successfully automated. Given the structural diversity and complexity of carbohydrates access to glycans has ben very time consuming to date. In order to delineate the structure- function relationship of carbohydrates usable quantities of defined, pure glycans is required. The ultimate goal of our group is the develop- ment of an generally solid phase automated synthesis method for glycan synthesis. In this context we analyzed thebacterial glycospace using bioinformatics tools. Interestingly,this analysis revealed that relatively few monosaccharidebuilding blocks are required to access most bacterialoligosaccharide structures [1]. Following on fundamental work regarding all aspects of automated oligosaccharide synthesis [2]we developed an efficient and reliable production of struc- turally defined oligosaccharides based on a standardized,automated synthesis procedure that will provide an essentialfoundation for the field of glycobiology [3]. To be of use in gly- cobiology studies, these oligosaccharides are usually immo-bilized or conjugated through a functional linker ( Fig. 1). Fig 1. Overview of the fully-automated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis work flow [3]. Sialylated glycans are particularly important for interactions of complex glycans with proteins relevant for viral infections. For the first time we have been able to extend the automatedsolid phase synthesis paradigm to the incorporation of sialicacid residues into oligosaccharides of biological relevance [4].Presentation of Carbohydrates on DNA DuplexesMultivalent interactions occur throughout biology in whichtwo biological entities interact with each other throughsimultaneous, specific association of two or more ligandsand receptors. Many different polymeric backbones, includ-ing peptides, have been used for the presentation of carbohy-drate antigens as vaccine candidates. However, most ofthese approaches result in constructs that require long syn-thetic routes and spatially undefined structures. A new method [5]for the spatially defined alignment of carbohydrates on a duplex DNA scaffold is presented ( Fig. 2). The use of a NHS-ester phosphoramidite along with carbohy-drates containing an synthesis. Thismodification method during solid-phase synthesis onlyrequires the use of minimal amounts of complex carbohy-drates. The covalently attached carbohydrates are presentedin the major groove of the B-form duplex DNA as potentialsubstrates for type II C-type lectin receptors mMGL1 andmMGL2. CD spectroscopy and thermal melting revealed onlyminimal disturbance of the overall helical structure. Fig 2. Conjugation of carbohydrates synthesized by automation or in solution is achieved during the DNA synthetic cycle to produce DNA-carbohydrate conjugates.

In collaboration with a group at LeidenUniersity, mannuronic acid alginate oligomers, featuring oligosaccharide syn-thesizer The stereoselective formation of the /H9252-mannosidic linkages was secured through the use of novel mannuronicacid building blocks. The use of the synthesizer allowed us torapidly access target structures, without intermediate purifi-cations and in quantities that are not only sufficient to caterfor biological experiments but also to facilitate verification ofthe structural integrity of the compounds [6]. Automated Solid-Phase Synthesis of GlycosaminoglycansGlycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are important sulfated carbohy-drates prevalent in the extracellular The synthesis ofstructurally defined GAGs requires laborious procedures, andincorporating defined sulfation patterns is challenging. Novelorthogonal linkers are key to this very challenging project anda new acylsulfonamide safety-catch glycans play a major role in cell-sur-face interactions with external partners such as cells andviruses. Straightforward access to sialosides is required in order to study their biological functions on a molecular level. Anautomated oligosaccharide synthesis was used to facilitatethe preparation of this class of biomolecules [4]. Our strategy relies on novel sialyl /H9251-(23) and /H9251-(26) galactosyl imi- dates, which, used in combination with the automated plat-form, provided rapid access to a small library of conjugation-ready sialosides of biological relevance.

This bur- geoning field requires fundamental insights into the role specific oligosaccharides play in human immunity. Bacteria are display dif- ferent types of carbohydrates that are crucial in our quest to protect humans from pathogens. The bacterial surface is glycans has progressed, access tosynthetic oligosaccharides as tools for biological evaluationsare still limited. The vaccine subgroup is heavily invested inthe synthesis of cell surface glycans of a host of differentpathogens based on the development of protocols for thesynthesis of rare sugars and new synthetic approaches. Thesynthetic glycans serve to evaluate biological function and todevelop novel diagnostics and vaccines. Novel immunoassaymethods, new vaccine carrier concepts and delivery systemsare currently being explored. In 2012, the group has focused on the CPS of Streptococ- cus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, LPS Legionella.Streptococcus PneumoniaThe group is currently pursuing several serotypes and has fin-ished the synthesis of a number of the targets [1].

As with other major classes of biomolecules, cell surface glycans have an important biological role that span the spec- trum from relatively subtle, to those that are crucial for the survival of the organism that makes them. This group is interested in the structural and functional aspects of cell surface glycans. These glycans play important roles in biological recognition processes suchas immune surveillance, inflammatory reactions and infec-tion. Understanding the interactions of glycans with its bind-ing partners helps to define the basic processes involved ininvasion and infection. Differences in cell surface glycancomposition and its organization can be exploited to developglycan based prevention and detection strategies. We inves-tigate four different topics: 1) Cell surface glycan basedPathogen detection and diagnostic tests; 2) Bacterial Glycansas vaccine candidates (collaborations with N. Suttorp, L.Sander, M. Witzenrath at the Charite-Berlin; and U. VogelUniversity of Wurzburg); 3) Cell surface Glycans the inter-face of host-parasite interface; 4) Glycan binding proteinsand their role in host-microbe interactions. All four topicsinvolve the basic flow of work starting from identification,characterization and functional evaluation of glycan bindingto its interaction partners. Cell Surface Glycan Based Pathogen Detection and Diagnostic TestsMany pathogens decorate themselves with unique glycanresidues that are distinct from the host. Immunological toolslike antibodies or anti-glycan sera that recognize these uniquedifferences can serve to detect the pathogen. The presence ofantibodies in the serum of an infected host is a good biomark-er for the diagnosis and prognosis of the infection. Two proj-ects are currently being pursued towards these goals: \u00b7 Detection of plague ( Yersinia pestis ) based on a unique tri- heptose that is conserved in the lipopolysaccharide [1]. \u00b7 of Leishmania chagasi based on saccharide residues in lipophosphoglycan [2, 3]. Plague expresses lipo polysaccharide. Synthetic triheptose oligosaccharide was conjugated to a carrier protein. The resulting glycoconju- gates were immunized in mice to generate monoclonal anti- bodies (mAbs) specifically recognizing the lipopolysaccha- rides. Compared to other gram negative bacteria, generated antibodies specifically recognized plague pathogen ( Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Indirect immunofluorescent staining of showing unstained bacteria C:FITC specific fluorescence indicating binding of secondary antibody andD: overlay of all three layers. Fig. 2: Major steps involved in the immunological evaluation of glycocon- jugates based on PS-1 glycan from C.difficile Bacterial Glycans as Vaccine Candidates Antibodies against bacterial cell surface glycans have beenproven to be immunoprotective and three commercial vac-cines against bacterial capsular polysaccharides are avail-able in the clinic. In close collaboration with the vaccinechemistry subgroup we are evaluating the potential of syn-thetic oligosaccharides as vaccine candidates for bacterialinfections. Our focus are the following aspects of the vaccinedevelopment programs: \u00b7 Immunological evaluation [4,5] candi- date for meningococcal disease [6,7] \u00b7 Evaluation of vaccine potential of synthetic oligosaccha- rides based on bacterial capsular polysaccharides [8] HOST Pharmacy (M.G.University, Kerala, India) Master of Pharmaceutical sciences (1st Class Honours) majoring inPharmaceutical Chemistry) (Institute ofchemical technology, University ofMumbai, Mumbai, Senior Lecturer, Government Medical Calicut, India2006-2010: \"Vaccine delivery systems New Delhi, India)2011 Jan-2011 Sep : Postdoctoral Scientist, Department of Biomolecularsystems, Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces.Since 10/2011: Research Group Leader, Department Colloids H.

We prepareglycoconjugates of these oligosaccharides and carry out immu-nization experiments in animal models. The immune responseis evaluated using glycan microarrays, ELISA and surface plas-mon resonance (SPR). The functional evaluation of the immuneresponse in preventing infection is assessed by in vitrosurro- gate assays and experimental infection models. Clostridiumdifficile exo-polysaccharide-based oligosaccharides are poten-tial candidates for vaccine development. The antigens wereimmunogenic in mice and monoclonal antibodies recognizingthe structures were Glycan microarray a minimal disaccharide epitope that retainsimmunogenicity ( Fig. 2). Studies on clinical specimens from patients infected with C. difficile demonstrated the presenceof antibodies recognizing these structures [4]. The synthetic oligosaccharide vaccine candidates based on meningococcal LPS and pneumococcal capsular polysac-charides are ongoing. Immunization with glycoconjugatesbased on these structures elicited significant antibodyresponses in mice. Challenge studies, bacterial immunofluo-rescence studies and opsonophagocytic assays to evaluatethe immunoprotective effects of the elicited responses are inprogress. Cell Surface Glycans at the Interface of Host-parasite InterfaceNumerous parasites elicit immune responses directed to gly-can determinants within cell surface and secreted glycocon-jugates in animals and humans. Parasite glycans are alsoimportant in host-parasite interactions. This realizationprompted renewed interest in defining parasite-derived gly-cans to develop conjugate vaccines and new diagnostics forparasitic infections. In addition, we aim to understand thebiochemical role of these glycans. Within this theme thegroup works on three projects: \u00b7 Role of extra-cellular vesicles in the infection biology of the apicomplexan parasite \u00b7 a vaccine and diag- nostic marker for toxoplasmosis. Apicomplexan parasites like Plasmodium and Toxoplasma are known to actively invade their respective hosts by hijackingand modulating the host cell responses. While the secretory proteins of these parasites have been studied in depth, no reports on the release of exosomes or microvesicles and the effector mechanisms they may mediate with the cells of the host system exist. Using T. gondii as a model organism we have isolated membrane vesicles released by parasites in therange of 40-150 nm. Biochemical characterization revealed the presence immunodominant and glycol- ipids like Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPI). We are charac-terizing the vesicles released by virulent and non-virulent strains of Toxoplasma and the possible roles they play inmodulating the host cells in the context of invasion or innateresponses against these parasites. Monoclonal antibodies against malarial GPIs have studied and STD NMR for epitopemapping. The mAbs recognize both natural as well as syn-thetic GPIs. Further studies on parasite binding and thepotential of anti-GPI antibodies in limiting the invasion ofparasite to RBCs are in progress. We have investigated the potential of T. gondii GPIs using synthetic glycan based arrays for the diagnosis of toxo-plasmosis [10]. Screening of clinical specimens from patients infected with T.gondii showed significantly higher levels ofanti-GPI antibodies indicating the biomarker potential ofGPIs. We are further investigating the immunogenicity of T.gondii GPI glycoconjugates to evaluate their potential as vac-cine candidates. Glycan Binding Proteins and their Role in Host-microbe InteractionsIdentifying and characterising glycan binding proteins onhost cell surface is important to understand their role in thehost-pathogen interactions. To meet this aim, we use the gly-can array platform to screen cell lysates; clinical specimensas well purified recombinant proteins. \u00b7 Role of parasite GPIs during host cell activation [11, 12] GPIs present on the cell surface of the Apicomplexan para-sites participate actively in the stimulation of immune hostcell system and/or in the host cell invasion process. Usingthe synthetic glycan array platform we identified a cell surface isoform of moesin that interacts specifically withGPIs ( Fig. 3). The moesin-GPI interaction is essential for macro phage activation in vitro mediating a pro-inflammatoryresponse. Due to increasing drug resistance, targeting theGPI-moesin recognition process should enable novel modesof therapeutic intervention against Apicomplexan infection.

[11]Azzouz, plex glycolipids that are found in eukaryotic cells either attached to the C-terminus of pro - teinsor in free form. GPIs contain a phospho- ethanolamine unit connecting the C-terminus of the protein to the glycan, a conserved pseu- do-pentasaccharide core and a lipid attached to the core glycan via a phosphodiester [1]. The con- served GPI structure can be further decorated by vari- ous substituents including additional phosphoethanolamine units, an additional fatty acid ester and oligosaccharidebranches. The lipid subunit is variable and may include diacyl-glycerol, alkylacylglycerol or a ceramide, with chains of differ-ent length and varying degrees of unsaturation ( Fig. 1). Fig. 1: Structure and possible modifications of GPI anchors. (DAG Diacyl- glycerol, AAG: Alkylacylglycerol) The primary biological role of GPIs is to localize the attached protein to the outer surface of the plasma membrane bilayer [2]. However, it is suggested that GPIs play a role in the associa-tion of anchored proteins with lipid rafts and are, thereby,involved in diverse processes such as regulation of innateimmunity, protein trafficking, and antigen presentation [3]. Development of a General Strategy to obtain GPIs Studies that would link a specific function to a structurally unique GPI rely on availability of homogeneous material ofthese glycolipids. To address this need we have developed a general synthetic route to obtain well-defined GPI glycolipids [4]. Our strategy is based on modular assembly of common building blocks and relies on a fully orthogonal set of protect- ing groups that enables the regioselective introduction ofphosphodiesters and efficient assembly of the GPI glycans( Fig. 2). This general strategy has been applied to the synthe- ses of different branched and structurally distinct GPIs: theGPI of T. gondii, the low molecular weight antigen of T. gondii ( Fig. 2), the GPI anchor of T. congolense and the GPI of T. brucei VSG 117 [5].Fig. 2: Assembly sequence of the low molecular weight antigen from T. gondii using the general strategy The assembly of the glycan is dictated by the positioning of the temporary protecting groups, which is kept constantacross the set of common building blocks. The glycosylationsrequired for the assembly of different GPI glycans are per-formed between similar coupling partners making the reac-tions conditions broadly transferable between different GPIsyntheses. Both the late stage phosphorylations and glycosy-lations that form glycosidic bonds around the central man-nose have been optimized with respect to yield and stereose-lectivity, and shown to be competent in syntheses of diverseGPI targets. This work constitutes the first general approachto the synthesis of diverse GPI structures and the first syn-thetic route capable of producing GPIs with various substitu-tion patterns including: monosaccharide and complex oligo -saccharide branches with challenging glyco-sidic bonds, branches at both C3 or C4 position of Man I, di-and triphosphorylated structures, and generally diverse GPIsisolated from different organisms. With the ability to producehomogeneous native GPI structures and the flexibility thatcan be used to accommodate further modifications and pro-duce unnatural analogues, this general strategy for the syn-thesis of GPI structures will enable extensive investigationinto the biological roles of these glycolipids. Biophysical Studies with GPI-Fragments Insights into the behavior of GPIs and GPI-anchored proteins(GPI-APs) in cell membranes could contribute to the under-standing of the roles GPIs play in biological processes. In thiscontext, we have synthesized different lipidated GPI-corefragments and have evaluated in collaboration with the inter-faces department the structural characteristics and confor-mational behavior of GPIs in well-defined membrane models.This biophysical the oblique lat-tice of the alkyl chains and the molecular lattice formedowing to highly ordered head groups ( Fig. 3). The head-group ordering is observed regardless of incubation period probablybecause a hydrogen-bond network rigidifies the monolayerstructure and can be disrupted on highly concentrated ureasubphases [6]. 62 (GPIs) AND GLYCOPROTEINS Daniel Var\u00f3n Silva 09.04.1974 Diploma in Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, National Uni- versity of Colombia, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia1998-2002: Research associate, Depart- ment of Chemistry, Colombian Immunolo-gy Institute Foundation, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia 2003-2007: PhD in Chemistry, Bioorgan- ic Chemistry, University of Bayreuth,Bayreuth, Germany2007-2008: Postdoctoral Fellow, Laboratory of Organic Chemistry, SwissFederal Institute of Technology, Zurich,Switzerland2009-2010: Postdoctoral Fellow, Department of Planck Berlin, GPI Max PlanckInstitute of Colloids and Interfaces,Berlin, GermanySynthesis and Properties of GPI-Anchors Fig. 3: a) Contour plots of corrected X-ray intensities as a function of in- plane (Qxy) and out-of-plane (Qz) scattering vector components of mono-layers of 1 on PBS (2 mNm -1black, and 30 mNm-1red). b) Representation of the commensurable lattices describing the lateral order of the alkylchains and of the molecules. Repeating unit cells (red, yellow, andmagenta) c) Structure of the GPI-Core fragment 1. d) Representation ofthe molecules at the air/water interface: lateral view. Studies on mixed monolayers of the GPI-fragments and POPC demonstrate that above a certain concentration of the frag-ment 1, phase-separation occurs owing to the strong head-group interactions. Below this concentration, the fragmentmixes with the liquid disordered POPC and induces order in ahighly cooperative way. Thus, the GPI fragment 1 tends tocreate ordered phases as it either forms a highly crystallinestructure or induces liquid ordered domains (rafts). This abili-ty could have important implications for the interactions ofGPI-APs and GPIs in cell membranes. Additional to high purity compounds, and the studies on membranes, to disclose structure-activity relationship (SAR)of GPIs, it's necessary to obtain structural information of theGPI-glycans. In collaboration with theory department we haveperformed a thorough conformational analysis and NMR char-acterization of GPI glycan fragments [7]. A spreadsheet com- pilation of data from regular MD trajectories covering a com-plete collection of substructures provides a survey of theover all conformational character of the fragments. We haveperformed biased MD simulations on a selected set of sub-structures. The biased dynamics permit us to explore free energy landscapes of glycosidic angles. The analysis clearly identifies the dimannoside /H92511\"6 linkage as critical with re - spect to sampling efficiency and accuracy. Corresponding data sets from regular MD runs were then used, in combina- tion with the results on disaccharides, to verify that the tetra - saccharide can be viewed as a sequence of independent gly- cosidic linkages, the conformational preferences of which are essentially inherited from disaccharide substructures ( Fig. 4).Fig. 4: a) Distribution p(r 14) for the end-to-end distance from MD data (black) and the MC result (red). b) Structure of the GPI tetrasaccharide GPI fragment. c) Translation of an reduced topology. d) Critical /H9251(1\"6) dimannoside. and Infection Diseases Certain pathogenic parasites express non-protein-linked, freeGPIs, which have been suggested to regulate the hostimmune response during parasitic infections [8]. However, in most cases, the heterogeneity and difficult isolation of pureGPIs have limited the evaluation of their function and therelationship with the GPI structure. The parasite T. gondii, causing toxoplasmosis, expresses two different GPIs; one of them is a free GPI and is known asthe low-molecular weight antigen. This GPI was synthesizedusing the general strategy and immobilized on glass slides.Recognition studies with anti-GPI monoclonal antibodiesshowed a specific recognition of this GPI structure, implyinga structure-immunogenicity relationship and suggesting theirapplicability in research. Furthermore, T.gondii GPIs bearing a thiol linker have been prepared andused to obtain GPI-conjugates that are valuable tools in toxo-plasmosis research and are currently under evaluation. Othersynthetic GPIs have also been printed in micro-arrays andused to evaluate the presence of antibodies anti-GPI in otherinfections. Similarly to T gondii, during the infection of T. con-golense specific immunological responses anti-GPI has beenprobed and the obtained antibodies did not show cross reac-tivity with other parasitic GPIs, demonstrating the impor-tance of having well-defined molecules to disclose biologicalfunctions. Further studies with these and other GPI are inprogress. D. Var\u00f3n Silva , K. Arnsburg, S. D. and I. Vilotijevicdaniel.varon@mpikg.mpg.de 63References: [1]Ferguson, M. A. J., Homans, S.

Advances in reaction condition control have accelerated new method devel- opment and discovery. Recent tools include automated synthesizers, microwave reactors, and flow/microreactors [1,2]reactors. In the Microreactors as Tools for Organic Che - mists (MTOC) group, flow reactors are used for three purposes: \u00b7 To develop continuous chemical processes. Specifically, MTOC is creating cost effective routes to medicines critical for the developing world (with C. Correia, K. Gilmore, D.Kopetzki and technischer Magdeburg). \u00b7 To create novel chemical methods. Microreactors provide unique environments that enable new chemistry. Flow reac-tors are being used by the MTOC to synthesize bifunctionalreactive intermediates and multi-functional fluorophores,for example (D.T. McQuade, F. Bou-Hamdan, A. O'Brien andM. Plutschack; with Prof. Dr. Meggers). \u00b7 To perform oligosaccharide synthesis. Microreactors enable optimization of glycosylations, creation of novel glycosyla-tion methods and production of novel saccharide-basedmaterials.

Millions of people in the developing world cannotafford life-saving medicines. Access to medicines such asanti-malarial and anti-viral agents would be increased if pro-duction costs could be decreased. The MTOC is actively de -ve loping advanced chemical syntheses of key active pharma-ceutical ingredients used to treat malaria and HIV. The team has recently synthesized the anti-malaria drug artemisinin using a continuous photochemical process. Theprocess begins from dihydroartemisinic acid (DHA) [3], a start- ing material now available on large scale via fermentation( Scheme 1). The initial configuration used a mercury arc lamp and provided 39% yield of artemisinin from DHA. Recently, the process was optimized to 69% yield from DHA. The increased yield leads to a throughput of 165g ofartemisinin per day using visible light LED illumination. currently synthesizing the artemisinin-based APIsartemether, artemotil and artesunate. In addition, we aredeveloping novel continuous routes into other medicineswhere decreased cost could increase access to those in greatneed of these agents.

Novel Chemical Methods: Leveraging Continuous ReactorsContinuous reactors have been used by chemical engineersfor over a century, but micro- and meso-reactors (flow reac-tors, collectively) have only recently become broadly avail-able to the synthetic organic chemist. These reactors offer anumber of significant advantages including: (1) controlled heat transfer; (2) controlled mixing, both fast and slow;(3) increased photon-flux photochemical reactions;(4) controlled use of highly reactive/toxic materials; and(7) increased capacity to run serial reactions.

[4]Most recently, the team has focused on transformations facilitated by light. Fig. 2: The fluorescent products resulting from an in-flow photoelectro- cyclization. Fig. 2illustrates ten fluorophores produced in a recent collab- oration with Prof. Dr. Meggers group where a photoelectrocy- clization was performed in flow, resulting in substantiallybetter yields and product quality relative to batch methods. [5] Homogeneous catalysts are expensive and methods enablingtheir continuous re-use while still retaining their active/selec-tivity represents an unmet challenge. The MTOC team hasrecently reported two new approaches to supporting cata-lystsspecifically for use in flow. The first method uses a mono -lith-based approach. [6]Monoliths are highly porous solids and are typically prepared using polymers such as acrylates thatdo not exhibit wide chemical compatibility. The MOTC pre-pared polystyrene monoliths using a photoinitiated-radicalpolymerization (K. Kr\u00fcger and K. Tauer). These monoliths werereadily functionalized with catalysts and demonstrated widechemical compatibility. The MTOC has also created a carbon-nanotube-based catch and release strategy for supporting catalysts ( Fig. 3).[7] Catalysts were appended to pyrene and captured using a col-umn of carbon nanotubes. When the nanotube bed was heat-ed, the catalysts were released and could be used in a flowreactor. At the exit of the flow reactor, a cooled carbon-nan-otube packed bed then captured the catalyst, allowing prod-uct to pass freely. This capture and release strategy wasused for multiple rounds of reactions without significant loss of catalytic activity. Microreactor-Based Oligosaccharide Synthesis Complex oligosaccharides play a fundamental role in cell- cell, bacteria-cell and virus-cell interactions. While the importance of these recognition interactions is becoming increasingly clear, the chemical synthesis of these biopoly- mers remains a significant challenge.Figure 3: A carbon-nanotube-based capture and release catalyst system. Captured catalysts are released by heating and used immediately withinthe reactor segment. Once exiting the reactor segment, the catalysts arethen recaptured on cooled nanotubes. The system is then reversed torecycle the catalyst. The MTOC group is contributing to this area by: \u00b7 developing new strategies to optimize glycosylations; \u00b7 creating new flow-based glycosylation reactions;\u00b7 synthesizing sugar monomers and\u00b7 creating new sugar-based materials in flow. Fig. 4shows a recent example from the MTOC where a flow glycosylation is achieved using mild gold-based catalysis.This method will enable the coupling of glycosyl-monomersthat contain acid-sensitive functional groups (S. Bhunia).

Our aim is the development of the next generation of polymer based biomimetics by combining chemical precision (monodisperse molecules) and high degrees of func- tionality obtaining a new class of polymers, the so-called pre-cision polymers. [1]In contrast to classical polymeric systems, these precision polymers do not exhibit any molecular weightor size distribution but are monodisperse. Furthermore theyare multifunctional systems with the functionalities beingpositioned along or within the polymer backbone with a spe-cific order or sequence. Fig. 1: General scheme of solid phase polymer synthesis: dimer building blocks are assembled on solid-support additionand deprotection. The final sequence-defined, monodisperse scaffoldsare obtained directly after cleavage from the support. The whole processis automated by using a standard peptide synthesizer. In order to develop a straightforward synthetic route to such sequence-defined, monodisperse polymer segments, solidphase-supported synthesis is applied (Solid Phase PolymerSynthesis, SPPoS) ( Fig. 1).[1,2]Tailor-made dimer building blocks are coupled sequentially offering different spacerunits as well as natural and non-natural functionalities with-in the main or side chain ( Fig. 2).[2-5]Since for every addition a different building block can be used, different functionali-ties can be introduced and positioned within the chain aswell as different architectures e.g. branched or ring struc-tures can be realized depending on the choice of themonomer sequence. Fig. 2: Examples of functional dimer building blocks suitable for the solid phase synthesis of precision polymers.[2-5] With this new synthetic platform in hand, we now focus on exploring two major advantages of precision polymer basedbiomimetics: On the one hand the control over their chemicalcomposition allows for deeper insights into the structure-property relations of polymers for biomedical applications, sofar mainly obtained by purely empirical studies. On the otherhand, they allow for the straightforward synthesis of highlycomplex, multifunctional systems e.g. combining natural andnon-natural ligands or functionalities and therefore have agreat potential for the development of multicomponent thera-peutics and drug delivery vehicles. 66 Laura Hartmann Diploma thesis in thegroup of Dr. J.

Topic: Synthesis ofmonodisperse, multifunctional neogly-copolymers and neoglycopolymer-hybrids and their biomedical applications\"Precision Glycopolymers for Receptor Targeting and Drug DevelopmentPRECISION POLYMERS AND POLYMERIC BIOMIMETICS Glycopolymers for Receptor Targeting Special focus is devoted to the combination of our precisionpolymers with sugar ligands. Such carbohydrate ligands takepart in many biological processes like intercellular recogni-tion and pathogen identification, often involved with multiva-lent presentation of the sugar ligands on a protein scaffold.Replacing the scaffold with a polymer therefore is a straight-forward approach leading to more easily accessible, morestable and multifunctional sugar and sugar-protein mimetics.Precision glycopolymers now allow for the total control overthe number, density and distancing of different sugar ligandsalong the scaffold and thus for a systematic structure-proper-ty relation study. In a first set of glycopolymers consisting of a hydrophilic, flexible backbone of the same length, we varied the numberand distancing of sugar ligands (mannose) ( Fig. 3) and deter- mined the binding affinity towards the lectin receptor Con-cavalin A (ConA) via surface plasmon resonance. [3]We found a strong dependence of the binding affinity on the number aswell as the distancing of the sugar ligands. To our surprise,even the monovalent system (just one sugar attached to thepolymer scaffold) already shows an increase in affinity by100 fold while the scaffold itself does not show any unspe-cific interactions. We conclude that some of the hydrationwater from the scaffold is released upon binding resulting inan entropic gain (the effect of water as 'molecular mortar'). Ifwe go up to a trivalent system, we even see an increase inaffinity of 260 fold per sugar compared to the monosaccha-ride ligand, one of the highest values for comparable systemsreported in literature so far. [3]Altogether these results show the importance of tailor-made polymer scaffolds for thedesign of novel glycomimetics. Another advantage of our synthetic approach is the straightforward access to so-called heteromultivalent sys-tems, presenting different sugar ligands at different posi-tions along the polymer backbone ( Table 1).[4,6] Fig. 3: A first set of precision glycopolymers shows different inhibitory concentrations depending on the number and distancing of sugar ligands along the polymer backbone (measured via SCP-RICM) [6, 8]. In a first experiment we found that the trivalent all-mannose system exhibits the same IC50 value as the trivalent hetero-multivalent (Man, Gal, Man) system. So far we attribute thisto a possible divalent binding mode of the two mannose lig-ands that is not altered by the nature of any additional lig-ands. [6] Table 1: Heteromultivalent Glycopolymers obtained via SPPoS Ongoing studies expand the library of glycopolymer ligandstowards more complex architectures including hydrogels aswell as take a closer look at the molecular interactions of gly-copolymer ligands and the targeted protein receptor. [7,8]Cur- rently our precision glycopolymers are tested in various bio-logical applications such as targeted gene delivery, vaccinedevelopment and as antibacterial agents. L. Hartmann , M. Behra, J. Keller, S. Lel, S. adhesion energy measurements,Soft Matter, 8, 1664-1672 (2012). Innate immunity is of crucial importance as a first line of defense against invading patho - gens. Particularly, dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in antigen presentation and the initiation of a protective immune respon - se. DCs sense pathogens via pattern recogni- tion pathogen-associated C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) represent a major PRR family predominantly expressed by cells of the innate immune sys- tem. CLRs recognize carbohydrate structures in a Ca2+-de pen - dent manner and orchestrate innate responses to a number ofpathogens including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and hel minths( Fig. 1). Since ligands have yet been identified for only a limit- ed number of CLRs, one major goal of the Glycoimmunologygroup is to screen for novel carbohydrate ligands of CLRs. Ascarbohydrate/lectin interactions usually display low affinities,multivalent ligand presentation is often required. Thus, weuse different scaffolds for multivalent display of CLR ligandsto allow for a specific targeting of DCs. Finally, we explorethe function of CLRs in vivoin mouse models of infection and inflammation. CLR-deficient mice are used to investigate therole of a single CLR in inflammatory processes ( Fig. 1). Fig.1: Main research goals of the Glycoimmunology group. The main focus is on carbohydrate recognition by C-type lectin receptors (CLRs,top panel). In innate immunity, CLRs are predominantly expressed byantigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells. They recognizeconserved carbohydrate structures of pathogens such as bacteria, virus-es, or fungi. CLRs consist of an extracellular part containing one or morecarbohydrate-recognition domains (CRD), a transmembrane region (TM),and a cytoplasmic part (Cyt). Specific research topics of the Glycoim-munology group are: 1) the identification of novel CLR ligands using the glycan array platform (bottom left), 2) cell-specific drug delivery by CLRtargeting with multivalent ligands (bottom middle), and 3) elucidatingthe role of CLRs in vivo using mouse models of infection and inflamma-tion (bottom right). Glycan Recognition by Antigen-Presenting Cells Impacts Immunogenicity Carbohydrate recognition by CLRs influences key DC func-tions such as antigen presentation, cytokine release, and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Since all of these processes impact T cell priming and differentiation, CLR tar-geting is a means to orchestrate an initiated immuneresponse ( Fig. 2). Fig. 2: C-type lectin receptor targeting to modulate immune responses. The engagement of CLRs expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) influencesDC functions such as co-stimulation, and cytokine production. Na\u00efve Tcells recognize peptides presented by MHC molecules on the DC mem-brane through their T cell receptor (TCR). To proliferate and differentiateinto T effector cells, a second signal is required that is provided by co-stimulatory molecules expressed on the DC surface. Since CLR engage-ment impacts this process, CLR targeting might be a means to shape aninitiated immune response. Carbohydrate recognition by lectin receptors is not only important for pathogen sensing but also for binding of glyco-sylated vaccine antigens. As a consequence, the differentialglycosylation of vaccine antigens can affect their recognitionby CLRs, thus may influence immunogenicity. In recent workperformed in collaboration with the MPI-DKTS in Magdeburg(E. Rapp & U. Reichl), we investigated the impact of hemag-glutinin (HA) N-glycosylation on influenza virus immuno- genicity [1]. HA is the most abundant protein in the virus par- ticle membrane, thus it is an essential component of mostinfluenza vaccines. While the importance of HA glycosylationfor influenza virus entry into host cells is well-known, wewere interested in the impact of HA N-glycosylation on the recognition by antigen-presenting cells and subsequent T cellpriming ( Fig. 2). Influenza virus HA N-glycosylation was dependent on the host cell line used for virus production.Moreover, two cell line-produced influenza A virus variantswith diverse HA N-glycosylation patterns markedly differedin their immunogenicity. Namely, T cell activation andcytokine production in vitroand humoral immune responses in vivowere affected by the differential HA glycosylation. Virus deglycosylation dramatically decreased cytokine pro-duction by spleen cells and reduced HA-specific antibodyresponses upon immunization of mice indicating a crucialrole of HA N-glycosylation for immunogenicity. Our findings have implications for cell line-based influenza vaccinedesign: appropriate host cell lines can be selected for viruspropagation or may even be glyco-engineered to enhanceimmunogenicity.

A Platform towards Carbohydrate-Based Adjuvants and Immune ModulatorsTo identify immune stimulatory and immune modulatory CLRligands, we have developed a screening platform, followedby in vitroand in vivoassays. The extracellular domains of different CLRs were expressed as fusion proteins with the F C part of human IgG 1molecules. The CLR-F Cfusion proteins were used as tools to screen for carbohydrate ligands ofCLRs. We employed the glycan array technology that allowsfor high-throughput screening of lectin/carbohydrate interac-tions (shown in Fig. 3). Indeed, novel binding partners of CLRs were identified and interactions with already known ligandscould be confirmed. Carbohydrate-protein interactions werefurther characterized by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)measurements. Next, conjugates were used in co-cultivationassays of DCs and T cells to stimulate transgenic T cells in vitro. In addition, mice were immunized with these conju- gates to identify immune modulatory CLR ligands in vivo. This platform brings together CLR ligand identification and theirimmunologic evaluation. Hence, it is a highly useful tool forthe functional analysis of CLR ligands (Eriksson, Maglinao etal., manuscript in preparation). Identified carbohydrate/CLRinteractions will be investigated in detail to elucidate theirrole in immunity [3]. Fig.3: The glycan array platform to identify novel carbohydrate ligands of C-type lectin receptors. 1) Sugar printing: Synthetic glycans (each con- taining a linker with a terminal nucleophile) are covalently immobilized on epoxide-activated glass slides. 2) Glycan screening: To identify glycan ligands of CLRs, the array is incubated with the respective CLR-F Cfusion protein (some examples of CLR-F Clibrary members are given). Detection is then performed using a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody.Multivalent Targeting of C-type Lectin Receptors Due to the generally low affinities of single carbo hy -drate/lectin interactions multivalent ligand display is usuallya specific CLR targeting. Recent studies indi-cate that multivalency is indeed a means to overcome theselow affinities and exert biological effect [4, attached to a DNA backbone and presentedin the major groove of the B-form duplex DNA. MGL bindingwas analyzed by SPR measurements and studies inprimary macrophages and DCs. Specific ligand binding toMGL was detected indicating the suitability multivalentcarbohydrate ligand presentation for CLR targeting [5]. Multi- valent targeting approaches can also be employed toincrease the targeting specificity of drugs for tumor cells. Weused reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer poly-merization (RAFT) to covalently and site-specifically append adefined HPMA polymer the cancer SN-38 Tsanaktsidis, CSIRO conjugates displayed solubility and stability and retained the cytotoxic activityof the parent drug SN-38. In vitroassays using cancer and non-cancer cell lines showed the specificity of the RAFT-derived poly-HPMA-SN-38 conjugates for cancerous cells.Further specific tumor targeting might be achieved by cova-lent attachment of small molecules (e.g. carbohydrates) tothe polymer-drug conjugates. Carbohydrate-carbohydrate Interactions In a recently started project as part of the CollaborativeResearch Centre (SFB) 765 (\"Multivalency as chemical organ-ization and action principle\"), we focus on the characteriza-tion of carbohydrate interactions. Interactions between car-bohydrates are even weaker than carbohydrate/lectin inter-actions, thus are often hardly measureable. The SFB projectdeals with the biophysical and biological analysis of interac-tions between the tumor-specific carbohydrate antigens GM3and GB4 and GalGB4. Since multivalent pres-entation is essential to measure these low affinity-interac-tions, the relevant carbohydrate antigens are functionalizedon the surface of nanoparticles. Currently, we investigatewhether these multivalent carbohydrate interactions are suit-able for cell-specific targeting and imaging. B. Lepenies , M. J. T. Miltsch, U. Vogel, S. ZimmermannBernd.Lepenies@mpikg.mpg.de . 69 Carbohydrate structures represent a funda- mental class of biopolymers and have been identified as important mediators of many recognition processes in health and disease. Their function is determined by the context of their presentation, as glycoproteins or gly- colipids, and the structure and dynamics of their receptors. Myeloid C-type lectin receptors (CTLRs) are one subfamily of carbohydrate binding proteins of particular interest. This receptor family is defined by it consensus protein fold and for most members, the calci-um-mediated recognition of self- as well as non-self carbohy-drates structures. This protein/carbohydrate interaction thenshapes for example the cellular response to necrotic cells ordetermines the immune response to invading pathogens. Thedetails of this molecular interaction and mechanisms cou-pling it to immunological outcomes are not well understood.Fundamental insights are expected from these investigationsinto this exciting field of molecular immunology and will pro-vide potential for the development of immune modulatorytherapeutics. Therefore, state of the art biophysical techni -ques such as nuclear magnetic resonance and fluorescencespectroscopy, together with computational modelling areapplied to address questions of high relevance for immunolo-gy [1]. In particular, these insights are utilized to design high affinity, specific and chemically defined probes to investigatethe biology of C-type lectin receptors. Computer-Aided Design and Synthesis of Ligands for CTLRsCompared to the number of members of the C-type lectin foldfamily, the structural information is rather sparse. Still, a fewmembers of the subfamily of myeloid CTRLs have been char-acterized by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy.The resolution of these structures is of sufficiently high reso-lution allowing in silico methods to be used to aid the searchfor small molecular probes for these lectins. CTLRs that obeya calcium-mediated recognition of glycans share a shallowbinding site ( Fig. 1). This not only explains the intrinsically low affinity of these cell surface receptors for their glycanligands, but also imposes a challenge to any rational designof high affinity ligands for these proteins. Available X-ray structures are chosen as a starting point, which display the respective CTLR in complex with one or more glycan ligands. The design process therefore starts from an already existing ligand pose and hence develops thisinto a high affinity lead structure [2]. This has advantagescompared to de novo design strategies and builds on theexpertise of the department in the field of carbohydratechemistry. The chemistry of carbohydrate derivatizationimplies certain restrictions onto the possible lead candidatesand is therefore directly incorporated into the design process,allowing a rapid advancement of computational models intosynthetic molecules.

Fragment-Based Drug Design The pipeline of many pharmaceutical companies has experi-enced a decline of preclinical candidates during the lastdecade, raising a serious demand on novel strategies for rap-id hit finding and lead progression. Since Fesik and cowork-er's key contribution to the field by establishing SAR-by-NMR [3], fragment-based approaches in drug discovery have devel- oped many facets. These approaches are no longer limited tonuclear magnetic resonance and make use of other sensitivetechniques such a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and X-ray crystallography of ligand cocktails for screening. Withrespect to the screening methodology, a sensitive detectionis mandatory, as molecular fragments of the size of 250 Da orless are intrinsically of low affinity. What renders them inter-esting starting points for ligand design is their limited chemi-cal complexity, allowing to fit many structural requirementsimposed by their potential receptors. Hence, these fragmentlibraries have high hit-rates. These hits can then be develop edinto lead structures by processes such as fragment-linking or-growth [4], giving rise to an impressive list of clinical drug candidates against challenging candidates [5]. 70 Christoph Rademacher 05.05.1979 2001-2004: Bachelor the University of L\u00fcbeck, Germany (with honours).2004-2006: Master Studies in \"Molecu- lar Life Science\" at the University ofL\u00fcbeck, Germany (with honours)2006-2009: Doctoral Thesis: tions Prof. the Fonds der Industrie.2009-2011: Postdoctoral training at Department of Chemical Physiology, TheScripps Research Institute with Prof. Dr.James C.

While the academic environment favours the development of preclinical candidates, many applicationsfocus on the development of chemical probes for chemicalbiology. In particular, undruggable, challenging binding siteshave been explored using fragment-based approaches, dis-covering that the static nature of structures determined by X-ray determined can be misleading [7]. Here, we use fragment- based design strategies to identify CTLR ligands from poolsof small molecules. To this end, a fragment library wasrationally designed using chemoinformatics tools. The poolbearing over 1000 diverse compounds was assembled fromcommercial vendors and academic collaborations ( Fig. 2). The library is now available for screening and will benefit from itsdiversity. Fig. 2: Diverse fragment screening library. (a) A selection of small hete- rocyclic compounds is shown. (b) A scatterplot of the chemical versusshape diversity highlights the coverage of chemical space of the library.Chemical diversity is assessed using MACCS chemical fingerprint com-bined with the Tanimoto similarity coefficient and plotted against thediversity as determined using the 3Deigenshape function of MOE (Chem-ical Computing Group). Glycan Fingerprints CTLRs interact with a diverse set of glycan structures of self-as well as non-self origin. To understand these lectin recep-tor interactions with their natural glycan ligands, a unifyingpicture of glycan diversity has to be developed that is able tocope with this complex pattern. To rationally address this pro -blem and to approach related problems in glycobiology, we developed a formal guide to quantify glycan diversity [8]. In contrast to other biopolymers such as peptides and oligo - nucleotides, the branched structure of carbohydrates imposes challenging demands on the comparison of glycan structures. This rational can then guide the construction of diverse glycan libraries, a central question in the field of glycomics [8]. Fig. 3: Glycan Fingerprints. (a) The CFG representation of a complex glycan is decomposed into all possible fragments. The existence of allunique fragments is stored into a bit string, transferring a branchedstructure into a linear representation. (b) Based on the string representa-tion of glycans, the similarity between carbohydrates can be assessedquantitatively and a non-rooted tree depiction of a glycan library isderived. Clusters of high density as well as non-represented clusters are highlighted to guide the chemistry to fill these gaps [8]. To date, the selection of glycans for carbohydrate libraries such as microarray studies was done empirically, drawing onexperience. Therefore, an algorithm was developed for theanalysis of glycan library diversity based upon an analogybetween a simplified glycan representation of monosaccha-rides and glycosidic bonds, as found in the symbol notation ofthe Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG), and smallmole cule graphs as used in chemoinformatics. This novel andpowerful approach allowed us to derive a linear representa-tion of complex glycan structures, which was then used tocalculate pairwise similarities. These similarities expressedin numerical values are fundamental to finally derive diversi-ties of groups of glycans and by that answering key questionsfor future development of glycobiology tools such as glycanmicroarrays. Furthermore, this tool will find its application in other fields of glycobiology such as the analysis of glycosylationpatterns. The glycosylation machinery is a very important com -ponent of the cell/cell communication system. It provides andstores information on the cell surface in defined recognitionpatterns and is dynamically adjusted. Means to quantify thisdiversity have been missing. The introduction of Glycan Fin-gerprints opens a door towards the systematic understandingof the dynamic interplay between cell physiology and glycosy-lation in a quantitative way. Transforming the overwhelmingdiversity of glycosylation into numbers will unravel new par-adigms and thereby integrating today's data from e.g. massspectrometry into a system wide framework. C.

Both, the protein and the glycan moiety of such a glycoconjugate are important information car- riers and in order to understand the language cells are using for communication in health and dis- ease scientists require robust and solid techniques that allow monitoring and deciphering of communication events on cel-lular level. In the context of protein glycosylation and its rolein bio-messaging the human immune system is one of thebest understood cellular mechanisms that has been shown tobe significantly influenced by the type and action of glycans [1]. Immune cell glycan alterations play a critical role in e.g. regulating effector functions such as dendritic cell or T cellactivation [reviewed in 1] . Glycan structures on in -sights into the cellular glycome promise to deepen our under -standing of intercellular communication mechanisms [2]. In order to decipher the language of complex multicellu- larsystems such as the human immune system detailed know -ledge on both, the individual proteins and their particular post-translational modifications such as glycosylation is vital. In thelast two decades the study of biomolecules has been greatlyfacilitated by novel developments in mass spectrome tric tech -niques and instruments, nevertheless further ad vancements intechnologies and approaches are required for the robust andaccurate identification and characterisation of glycoconju-gates derived from biological specimens. LC-ESI MS is a Powerful Tool for Glycoconjugate Analysis Combining nano-sale liquid chromatography (LC) online withstate of the art mass spectrometric (MS) detection tech-niques provides us with powerful opportunities to separate,isolate and characterise femto- to picomol amounts of bio-molecules derived from biological samples. Nano-scale LCseparation is an important additional dimension increasingsignificantly the amount of information that can be ob tainedfrom a single sample simply by supplying the compounds ofinterest to the mass spectrometer over the entire time frameof the LC separation, resulting in an increased depth of analy- sis and number of ions detected from a single sample. With-out this prior separation molecules present in lower concen-trations might not be detected and thus information on these components would be lost. In addition, the choice of separa- tion medium linked to the mass spectrometer provides us with the opportunity to specifically target the respective compounds of interest based on their molecular properties.Subsequently, reversed phase separation media are usuallychosen for the analysis of glycopeptides and peptides [3], whereas far better data can be obtained for oligosaccharidesreleased from glycoproteins when subjected to LC separationusing porous graphitized (PGC, Fig. 1, 3)[4]. Fig. Glycan structure isomers can be separated using PGC LC and sig- nature ESI-MS/MS spectra enable unambiguous glycan identificationFigure taken from [1]. Defined Standard Compounds Help us in Developing Novel Glycoproteomics TechniquesThe easy availability of well-defined biomolecules has al -ways been a key for scientific Simple accessto custom-made nucleotide or peptide sequences has turnedout to be vital for any molecular biology and biochemistryresearch. Recent advances in automated oligosaccharide syn -thesis are very promising to bride this gap in glycomics re -search [5]. However, glycoproteo mics research requires access to molecules that can be tailored on both, the peptide and theglycan side of the molecule. Current strategies based on total synthesis of both, the glycan and peptide moiety are suffering from limitations ofestablishing a native peptide-glycan bond under syntheticconditions as well as easy diversification of the glyco-moietyinto larger structures. Making use of nature's glycosylationpotential, the combination of controlled proteolytic digestion Daniel Kolarich 25.03.1975 2000:Diploma, Food Science and Bio - tech nology (University of Natural Re sour - ces and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna)2004:PhD, (University of Natural Resour - ces and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna),Topic: Mass spectrometry based glyco-proteomic analysis of GMO food cropsand allergens from plants and insects2005-2007: Postdoc, Natural Life Sciences, University, Sydney, Understanding Intercellular CommunicationGLYCOPROTEOMICS 73with state of the art separation technologies enables us to obtain glycosylated amino acids that can further be modifiedto be used in standard solid phase peptide synthesis for theproduction of tailor made glycopeptides. Using these synthetically produced glycopeptides and peptides we now have the opportunity to establish quantita-tive correlations of the different compounds that are fre-quently detected in a glycoproteomics experiment. The factthat these natural biomolecules exhibit significantly differentchemical properties makes it impossible to extract quantita-tive information from MS data without having appropriatestandards in hand. These well-defined standards enable de -termination of quantitative relationships from the detectedsignals and thus make label free quantitation of glycopep-tides a reality ( Fig. 2) [6]. Fig. 2: The application of exactly defined and quantified peptides (green circles) and glycopeptides (blue circles) produced by solid phase peptidesynthesis uncovered that glycopeptides differ significantly in their ionisa-tion efficiency. Injection of equal amounts of the target molecules resul -ted in significant differences in detected signal intensities. The ability tode ter mine and quantify these differences is an important step towardsob taining useful quantitative information for glycopeptides from MS-experiments [6]. Disease Glycoproteomics - Deciphering Intercellular in Inflammatory Bowel Dis-ease and Skin NeoplasiaThe glycoproteomics group is using its tools and develop-ments to understand how the intracellular glycoprotein com-munication network is changing in the course of diseases.With this information in hand it is possible to gain a betterunderstanding on disease onset and progression. In coopera-tion with medical institutions and international networks weare focusing on identifying and characterising glycoproteins and glycans associated with inflammatory bowel diseases,which have a prevalence of 0.8% and are associated withhigh morbidity, definite mortality and an increasing economicburden in particular in western countries. We are partners inthe IBD-BIOM consortium, an EU-funded elucidate particular IBD associated path-ways and disturbances to the immune system. Another major focus is the determination of skin neopla- sia glycoprotein signatures. With around 2-3 million casesper year skin cancer is one of the most prevalent cancer typesworldwide. Malignant melanoma, one of the most dangeroustypes of cancer if detected late, represents around 5% of thecases. The majority of reported cases comprise the so-callednon-melanoma skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma orsquamous cell carcinoma, which are seldom lethal but can bedisfiguring and a psychological burden to patients if detectedlate or left untreated. First results obtained on basal cell carci -noma specimens provided promising data indicating that sub-stantial changes in the glycome and glycoproteome are oc -curring. This information will be used to gain a deeper under-standing on the onset and progression of skin neoplasia. Fig. 3: Using Glycomics and Glycoproteomics detailed information can be determined from \u00b5g amounts of initial protein. LC-ESI-MS/MS techni quescan be successfully applied to identify proteins and their post translatio -nal modifications to understand their role in health and disease. [3,4].Figure taken from [3]. D.

H.: Structural analysis synthetic \"Heterophase Carbon Nanostructures innovative polyelectrolytes COLLOID CHEMISTRYScientific Profile The overall size of the Department of Colloid Chemistry is about 65 people, covering a wide range of research topics. The effective constituting element of the scientific activi- ties is the \"project\", a structure headed by a senior scientist involving a mixture of techni- cians, graduate students and post-docs (3-8 peo- ple). Projects are related to scientists, but usually have a temporal character of about 5 years. After this time, permanent scientists (including the director) have to redefinetheir profile to justify the allocation of resources. In the caseof non-permanent scientists, the projects usually leave thedepartment with the promotion of the scientist, i.e. the groupleaders can continue their specific research in their new aca-demic environment (usually as professors) without competi-tion of the institute. In the time of this report and following these schemes, serious changes of my department already observed in thelast two reporting periods continued to take place. Dr. Mag-dalena Titirici, group leader on \"Sustainable Carbon\", accept-ed a position at Queen Mary University London, and the moveof Prof. Dr. Xinchen Wang to Fuzhou University was complet-ed, moving \"Artificial Photosynthesis\" into an InternationalJoint Research Lab. At the same time, I hired Dr.Tim Fellinger (\"Electrocatalysis\") as new group leaders tostart to establish their own research profile. It is fair to saythat a majority of the group is now still in the primary phaseof higher academic profiling, making the following reportmore idea that publication oriented. This turnover of leadingjunior scientists is beyond typical and easy, but reflects thedynamic character of the department. The profile of the department has therefore been seri- ously reoriented, keeping only some of the old strongholds.The following topics are now found within the department: \u00b7 Heterophase Polymerization Liquids\u00b7 Service Lab Electron microscopy\u00b7 Carbon Materials and Hybrids for Energy applications\u00b7 Processes for the Raw Material Change\u00b7 De Novo Inorganic Nanostructures\u00b7 Photocatalysis and Artificial Photosynthesis The projects below those headers are briefly explained:Heterophase Polymerization precipitation polymerization.The solvent is usually water, but heterophase polymerizationin inverse media is also examined. This class of techniques,although one of the eldest in polymer science, is still mostactual, as it allows the production of high polymer containingformulations in water as an environment-friendly solvent.Solvent free coatings, glues, paper and fabric production arejust a small excerpt of a long list where polymer dispersionshave opened new possibilities and technologies, omnipresentin daily life, but usually unseen to the public. Central points of interest of the team working on hetero - phase polymerization are: \u00b7 We want to simplify the synthesis of complex polymer mor- phologies on a molecular level (synthesis of block & graft copolymers by emulsion polymerization) and on a colloidallevel (core-shell latices, hollow spheres, one-step synthesisof reinforced materials) by rational use of the particleinterfaces in heterophase polymerization ( Dr. Klaus Tauer ). \u00b7 We use new stabilizer systems (such as PILs) to generate new latexes structures and films with switchable Hydropho-bicity (Dr. Klaus Tauer , with Dr. Jiayin Yuan ) \u00b7 Emulsions stability be accomplished even without mole- cular stabilizers using ultraclean conditions. The mecha-nisms of are analyzed (Dr. Tauer ) Chimera Polymers and Novel Polymerization TechniquesAmphiphilic polymers consist of components which dissolvein different media, e.g. a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic part.Since we are able to adjust both components sensitively tothe dispersion medium as well as to the dispersant, am phi -philic polymers allow the stabilization of unusual dispersionproblems. The newest observation in this direction is thatalso block copolymers without hydrophobic contrast can self-assemble to complex structures. Focal points of interest inthis project group are: \u00b7 The micelle formation and lyotropic liquid crystalline phase behavior of blockcopolymers polymers is examined in depen- dence of the molecular structure, the relative amount of thedifferent components, as well as the secondary interactionsbetween the structure forming bio-like blocks ( Dr. Helmut Schlaad). \u00b7 The introduction of secondary interactions such as H-bridges or dipole interactions results in superstructures with morecomplex order and broken symmetry, which oint the way to general rules of biomimetic mesoscale organization (Dr. Helmut Schlaad ) 76Research of Colloid Chemistry 06.02.1960 1983:Diploma, Chemistry laude, University of MainzThesis: Diffusion in topological constraint polymer melts with Prof. Dr. H.

PILs are not only another class of ordinary poly-electrolytes, but carry extra properties, which can be attrib-uted to the high polarizability of the monomer units. As such,PILs hold some unique structural merits and are advanta-geous in a multitude of materials applications, such as gasseparation/absorption, carbon preparation, energy conver-sion, catalysis, and many more. PILs are also surface-activeand multifunctional polyelectrolytes. Though the originallydesigned task of PILs was only to effectively stabilize a widevariety of diverse nanoparticles, their unexpected versatilepowers were quickly recognized and contribute significant tocreate science from the products. \u00b7 PILs with special stabilization behavior and switchable solu- tion properties are constructed from a wider range on organic cations and anions ( Dr. Jiayin Yuan ). \u00b7 Biodegradable biomass-based are built from hydrothermal chemicals Yuan, Dr. Davide used via complexation and/or carbonization as mesoporous membrane materials with high chemical and permeation ( Dr. Jiaiyn Yuan, Markus Antonietti ). Service Lab on Electron MicroscopyAll the work described above is necessarily accompanied bya considerable amount of colloid analysis which includesspecial techniques of transmission and scanning electronmicroscopy on soft, structured matter which are runned onthe base of a central service group (Dr. J\u00fcrgen Hartmann ). It is a big problem that due to the financial crisis of the Max Planck Society and the delay of starting the extensionbuilding this group has to work under increasingly worseningworking conditions, keeping the operations alive with con-stant repair of now 20 years old machines. Materials for Energy applications Following the former project house ENERCHEM which wasdevoted to materials chemistry to handle energy problems, we still work on better fuel cells, new energy cycles, newcatalysts for more efficient processes, methane activation,better batteries, ultracapacitors, decentral energy storage devices. The new activities based in Golm include: \u00b7 New C/N-polymers and carbon materials to expand the property profile of carbon ( Markus Antonietti )\u00b7 Porous polymers as membranes for fuel cells and battery separators and as novel gas storage materials ( Dr. Jens Weber) \u00b7 Metal free catalysis and Nitride Catalysis for water split- ting, methane and ammonia activation, or CO 2-reactions (Prof. Dr. Xinchen Wang in the international joint laboratory, new group leader Dr. Dariya Dontsova ) \u00b7 New engineering carbons based on ILs and salt templating as electrodes and electrode membranes for fuel cells and electroxcatalysis; this also includes work on supercapaci-tors. Another application are metal free carbon catalysts forO 2and H 2activation ( Dr. for the Raw Material ChangeHydrothermal Carbonization is a 100 year old technique togenerate carbonaceous materials from biomass in a colloidalheterophase reaction processes. We reactivated in tha last10 years this process to address questions of the sustain-able/chemical synthesis of carbon nanostructures and - justrecently - also organic compounds. First experiments indi-cate that not only the non-oil based raw material base (\"sugar\") is highly attractive. It is also the broad range ofchemistry which can be addressed and which makes thisapproach attractive. \u00b7 Analysis of the elemental chemical steps of HTC and hybridization with technical monomers to generate new materials, such as mesoporous scaffolds for catalysis, bat-tery applications and modern chromatography These activi-ties are reported, but are transferred to London with the for-mer group leader Dr. Maria Magdalena Titirici ) \u00b7 Performing hydrothermal processing under distinct catalytic conditions does not lead only to carbon materials, but alsoto valuable organic intermediates and platform chemicals.We currently focus on lactid acid generation (for bioplas-tics), the synthesis of ionic liquids from biomass in waterand the production and valorization of a rather clean ligninfraction (Dr. Davide Esposito ) De Novo NanoparticlesMany materials, which are relevant for novel energy cyclesand more efficient chemical reactions (catalysis) do not existas nanostructures (or their synthesis is not sustainable) sothat \"de novo\" systems have to be designed from scratch. \u00b7 We develop new synthetic pathways towards metal carbide and nitride nanostructures, which offer new options for metal/base catalysis, but also are record holders inmechanical hardness and magnetization. In general, bothsize and shape add to the demanded properties and must becontrolled or adjusted. ( Dr. Cristina Giordano ) 77\u00b7 Based on paper as a reactant and printing of metal salts, we expect to develop a simple access to functional catalytic arrays and electrodes via materials transcription ( Dr. Cristi- na Giordano ) \u00b7 Unconventional heating devices such a focused light, microwaves, or induction coupling enables unconventionalsolid state processes with extreme temperature ramps andunmatchable reaction control. This is explored for nanopar-ticle synthesis in salt melts ( Dr. Tristan Corbiere ) Photocatalysis Artificial photosynthesisThe international joint laboratory on Artificial Photosynthesiswas established in July 2008 between the Max-Planck Insti-tute of Colloids and Interfaces (Prof. Markus Antonietti) andFuzhou University (Prof. Xianzhi Fu). The lab is now lead byProf. Dr. Xinchen Wang, a former MPI group leader. The artifi-cial versions of photosynthesis, i.e. (1) the splitting of waterinto hydrogen and oxygen, and (2) the conversion of carbondioxide into organics via sunlight, are both in the center ofthis program. An important challenge in artificial photosyn-thesis is the development of antenna structures or light con-verters that should be sufficiently efficient, stable, inexpen-sive, and capable of harvesting the abundant visible light insolar spectrum. There are many trials to establish stable sys-tems for this purpose, mostly based on inorganic semicon-ductors with appropriately engineered band-gap. In our groupwe are investigating polymeric and organic-inorganic hybridmaterials with controlled nanostructures as potential energytransducers for artificial photosynthesis for such applicationsas solar energy conversion, environmental purification, andorganic synthesis.\u00b7 Melon, a carbon nitride polymer with graphitic structure, has turned out to be efficient for the direct splitting of waterinto oxygen and hydrogen. We improve the chemical struc-ture of this polymer by copolymerization and textural controlto improve light extinction and quantum efficiency of thisprocess (Dr. Xinchen Wang, Dr. Dariya Dontsova). \u00b7 Metal doped C 3N4has turned out to be a valuable catalyst for a number of oxidation, photoreduction with \u00b7 The search for appropriate nanoscopic co-catalysts for oxy- gen liberation or CO 2conversion is another key issue.

After a temporal phase ofbeing too much involved in taking care of too many indepen-dent Junior careers, I personally prefer to enter a period withmore coordinated research and longer term goals focussedaround as director and more tightly bound junior people.Our trials to cooperate with the National Excellence Centreon Catalysis of the TU Berlin have not only led to anexchange of staff, but are to my opinion very promising, con-cerning the development of completely new catalyticschemes (with TU Organic and Inorganic Chemistry) Thereare some high impact schemes with TU Berlin in the pipeline. The started projects on \"Energy Materials\" and \"Process- es for the Raw Material Change\" turned out to be very timelyand secured my department in the last two years a leadingEuropean role in these activities. IN addition, the donation ofthe ERC Advanced Excellence Award has already led to somevery promising co-operations and broken paradigms. It is myintention to expand these activities by further focussing andprofiling. Larger Equipment and Central Service Labs of the DepartmentCommercial standard techniques which are available in thedepartment are: \u00b7 transmission and scanning electron microscopy, \u00b7 static and dynamic light scattering,\u00b7 diverse techniques of light microscopy,\u00b7 a chromatographic lab including a number of modern chro- matography techniques, \u00b7 reaction calorimetry with online multidetection,\u00b7 and porosimetry,\u00b7 MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry,\u00b7 FT-ATIR for liquid analysis. One of the labs, the electron microscopy lab, is a so-called \"central service labs\", i.e. it belongs and is operated by thedepartment, but is also designated to perform scientific rou-tine measurements for the whole institute. All other instrumental labs are not devoted to service opera-tions, but are nevertheless heavily involved in inter-depart- ment projects.Relations to Industry and SocietyThe department is involved in a large number of industrialprojects. We promote fruitful and truly mutual relations withBASF AG and Firmenich.

Markus AntoniettiDirector of the Department of Colloid ChemistryPolymer Dispersions/Heterophase Polymerizations Colloidal processes are omnipresent in the chemical industry and particularly in polymer chemistry, heterophase polymerization is a centennial technology which nowadays pro- duces high-tech polymeric materials with a value of several billion euros per year [1]. Thus, better understanding of heterophase polymerization and educating students on this topic is of general scientific and economic interest. Schizomorphic Latex Particles \"Schizomorphic\" particles, prepared by special radical het-erophase polymerization techniques [2], possess the ability to change shape and morphology in dependence on the particleconcentration. At very low concentrations, the particles evendisintegrate from spheres into rods, rings, and webs [3](Fig. 1). Hence, for amphiphilic block copolymer particles, conclusionregarding morphology and shape in the dispersed state,based on normal SEM or TEM images, should be madeextremely cautiously. Fig. 1 Different morphologies observed for amphiphilic polystyrene-co- sulfonate) particles; a micrograph, %, bar 200 nm; b, - cryo-SEM micrograph, 0.4, bar 500 nm; c - AFMimage from 0.0004%, side 400 nm) Photo-Initiated Bulk and Emulsion A comparative experimental study of bulk and emulsion poly-merization of styrene with bis-(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphine oxide (BAPO) or (BAG) as photoinitiator and anticipated differ- ences [4]. Photopolymerization of styrene with initiation in the monomer phase is under homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions as bulk and emulsion polymerization, re spec tively, characterized by essentially the same features with respectto radical formation and chain growth. In either case the poly - merization can be started photochemically with normal fluo-rescence tubes as light source which are also used for indoor illumination. Fig. 2 a - Correlation between monomer conversion and polymerization time for photo-initiated bulk polymerization of styrene; b - Developmentof the molecular weight distributions (BAPO): 1 - 4, 2 - 22, 3 - 76 %conversion The bulk polymerizations in the presence of photoinitiators continue even after complete decomposition of BAG andBAPO without the effect of dead end polymerization is beingobserved ( Fig. 2a). For BAPO initiated polymerization this is the expected behaviour as photodecomposition of phosphineoxide chain ends entails continuous generation of initiatingradicals [5, 6]. For BAG this effect seems less pronounced but nevertheless the bulk polymerization goes on for more than100 hours after complete photoinitiator consumption, interest -ingly, with increasing rate as also observed for the photo -initiator-free polymerization over the entire duration. The average molecular weight increases, independent of the polymerization procedure and recipe, with monomer con-version suggesting a certain kind of 'photo-controlled' chaingrowth ( Fig. 2b). Taken all experimental results together, we suggest that a photo electron transfer reaction between a styrene mono -mer and a repeating unit in the polystyrene chain leads repe ti -tivelyto generation of radicals (actually radical ions) ensuringboth polymerization in the absence of photoinitiator and in -creasing molecular weight with conversion [4]. Influence of Gas Phase Composition on HeterophasePolymerizationThe outcome of radical styrene heterophase polymerizationdepends strongly on the composition of the gas phase. Exper-imental data show that the effect of the gas phase is quite acomplex one and strongly influenced by the nature of the gas,the homogeneity or heterogeneity of the polymerization sys-tem, and the kind of initiator [7]. Evidence has been found that the influence of air goes beyond the simple action of oxygen which can cause decel -eration or acceleration of the reaction. The experimental re -sults show that the optimum polymerization conditions areobtained in the absence of any foreign gas. The connectionbetween the preceding discussion and heterophase polymer-ization is given by the colloidal nature of these systems andthe experimental fact that the rate of polymerization and therate of degradation of the emulsion show essentially thesame dependence on the composition of phase.HETEROPHASE Scientific Institute of Academy of Sciences ofthe GDR in Teltow-SeehofSince 1992: Group (Max Emulsion Poly(ionic liquid) nanoparticles were as sole stabilizers in aqueous emulsion polymeriza-tion and revealed an astonishing and unexpected behaviour [8]. In a well-dispersed state, the PIL nanoparticles serve as an unexpectedly effective stabilizer for polystyrene disper-sion, enabling solids content of greater than 40 %. However,the same PIL as dry powder is hydrophobic and, in accor-dance with Bancroft's rule, unable to stabilize aqueous dis-persions. The ambivalent behaviour of PIL is extremely bene-ficial for the application of aqueous dispersions because, asdesired for decades, the hydrophilic dispersed state duringsynthesis turns hydrophobic in the dried state during applica-tion of the polymer. This conclusion is supported by contactangle measurements on corresponding polymer films madeof dried latexes ( Fig. 3). Water shows on polystyrene made with sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate as a typical commonhydrophilic stabilizer a contact angle of 82.1 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b0. The con-tact angle for polystyrene made with PIL stabilizer is signifi-cantly larger (95.3 \u00b11 \u00b0). Fig. 3 Contact angle of water drops on polystyrene films illustrating the different hydrophobicity Plant Cell Models via Polymerization Plants adapt the geometry of their organs and tissue proper-ties to cope with external and internal stresses and to actu-ate organ movement. These actuating movements functionwithout an active metabolism, but are humidity-based sys-tems where a swellable material acts against a stiffer cellwall. Within this project we explore the possibility to mimic the mechanical behaviour of papaya plants. Within the SPP1420 we explored possibilities to build a humidity-sensitive actuator following the principles used bythe papaya plant [9]. We mimicked the papaya cell walls by radical copolymerization in a shape-similar PTFE-template (Fig. 4a and b). A suitable polymerization recipe ethylene glycoldimethacrylate as crosslinker to avoid phase separation. Thepolymerization was started photochemically with BAPO (UVLED as light source) at room temperature. The parenchymahydrogel was mimicked by subsequent polymerization of a mixture acrylic acid/methylene bisacrylamide inside the cellsof the polymer grid Initiating this polymerization leads to covalent attachment ofthe hydrogel to the cell walls.

Amphiphilic Block Copolymer ParticleHeterophase polymerization is a simple but powerful tool forthe synthesis of special block copolymer particles. Particular-ly interesting is the synthesis of particles for potential bio-medical applications such as pullulan decorated poly(hydroxy -ethyl methacrylate) particles. Fig. 5 Transmission electron of pullulan-g-PHEMA graft copolymer particles Both homopolymers are biocompatible and have already been successfully used in medical applications for decades.We reported their combination in nano-particles ( Fig. 5) for the first time [10]. In another study a new class of amphiphilic particles with a very special morphology has been discovered whenthe block copolymer synthesis is carried out in the presenceof cyclic sugars [11]. K.

Tauer, in preparation, 81 Porous polymers represent a flourishing area of research, which is driven by both: acade- mic and industrial interest. Porous polymers are relevant in a number of applications rang - ing from thermal insulation, gas separation or storage, catalysis to separation technolo- gies. The group is interested in new synthetic methods and advanced characterization of nano - porous polymers, namely micro- and mesopo rous poly - mers. Interaction with guests (including gas separation) as well as dynamic processes and stimuli-responsiveness of thenanoporous structures are among the core interests of theresearch unit. Microporous polymers, i.e. polymers having pore sizes of less than 2 nm can be considered as the polymer analogue ofzeolites and activated carbon and combine very high specificsurface areas (>>100 m 2g-1) with the rich synthetic possibili- ties of polymer science. Mesoporous materials have pore sizes between 2 and 50 nm. They are of interest in separation technologies, especial-ly for larger (bio)macromolecules. However, their science isless explored compared to microporous polymers. Sustainable Monomers and Methods Recently, microporous polyesters and polyurethanes were syn -thesized from a renewable natural resource, betulin ( Fig. 1). Betulin is the main component of the birch bark and hencenot in conflict with food production. Its content can be ashigh as 30 wt.-% and it is easily extractable by commonorganic solvents. Betulin was used as a rigid monomer to synthesize poly- ester and polyurethane networks with intrinsic microporosity, [1,2]which are made from up to 75 wt.-% of renewable mate- rials. The stiff structure of betulin prevents close packing ofthe polymer chains. Betulin can also serve as a monomer for linear, soluble polymers, which can be cast into self-supporting membranes.The obtained materials show promising results for CO 2over N2selectivity and might indeed be useful as gas separation membranes [1]. Next to microporous materials, betulin can also be used as the hydrophobic constituent of amphiphilic multiblock co -polymers (with Helmut Schlaad ) [3]. Sustainability can also be achieved by reaction control. Replacing organic solvents by water is a promising concept and was expanded to the synthesis of fully aromatic poly- imides [4]. The details of this new reaction are under investi- gation and initial steps towards morphology control of the resulting high-performance polymers could also be achieved.Fig. 1: chemical structure of cross-linked and soluble betulin-based poly- esters, photograph of binaphthalene-based monomer. The resultingpo lymers showed a significant surface area, but the poreswere apparently too small to allow access of larger organicmolecules. The homochirality was lost upon polycondensa-tion (partial racemisation) and no superstructure formationcould be observed yet [5]. Next to the synthesis of new polymers of intrinsic micro- porosity, interest was spent to a better understanding of themicroporosity (free-volume). The influence of intermolecularinteractions on the observable porosity could be proven.Hydrogen bonding can lead to pore size reductions, whichcan also be reversed upon temperature increase, i.e. thebreaking built from (fully) con-jugated monomers.

Du, M.D. Guiver: Influence of Intermolecular Interaction on the Observable Porosity in Intrinsical- ly Microporous Synthesis to Porosity AnalysisPOROUS POLYMERS A contrary concept is the use of copolymerization methods in order to tune the optical badgap of CMPs. Introducing thio-phene units into a spirobifluorene-based system could shiftthe emission color from blue to green. Additionally, it couldbe shown that energy transfer from the CMP to incorporatedguest molecules is possible [8]. The formation of a photoactive CMP based on the acid- base responsive phenolphthalein without affecting the switch -ing ability was demonstrated [9]. The final network can be switched between two different states (small pores, ioniccharges vs. larger pores, neutral state). The porosity and thepolarity (as probed by the heat of carbon dioxide adsorption)of the material could be tuned depending on the counterions(Li +vs. Cs+) (Fig. 2). Fig. 2: 3D representation of the central motif of the phenolphthaleine CMPs in the neutral and charged state. Blue stars indicate connectionpoints. Please note the changes of the geometry (fixed coordinate sys-tems) upon switching and the influence of the counterion (yellow) size. Mesoporous Polymers Mesoporous polymers can be synthesized either using tem-plating methods or by controlled phase-separation process-es. We employed hard-templating the synthesis of mesoporous polymers. A general problem of the hard-templating routine often-observed immiscibility of the aqueous dispersions monomers, which leads tophase separation. Acidified melamine-formaldehyde resin pre - cursors could however be mixed homogeneously with the aque-ous dispersion due to favorable electrostatic interactions. Thedispersion could be cured to yield mesoporous hybrid materials(as a consequence of phase-separation processes), whoseporosity could even be enhanced by removal of the silica [10]. The resulting porous resins showed promising behavior forgas separation applications as well as good properties forheavy metal ion removal. The low-price and scalability of themethod make those materials indeed interesting for relevant technologies. Another way to overcome the miscibility problem is to process the nanoparticle dispersion into a monolithic structure.This was achieved by an evaporative method, which resulted inmonoliths made of mainly random-close packed (RCP) nanopar-ticles. Backfilling divinyl benzene, DVB) and subsequent polymeriza- tion porous after template removal [11]. The porosity /H9278of the polymers is directly related to the space-filling RCP phase (typically /H9278~ 64%). The spher- mesopores have only a low polydispersity and their sizeis related to the size of the used nanoparticles (~12 or ~25 nm).Specific surface areas of up to 1000 m 2g-1could be achieved and post-functionalization (e.g. sulfonation) of the pores ispossible without loss of the porosity. Mesoporous polymers prepared in such way are hence ideal model systems (uniform pore size) for the study of themesopore collapse phenomenon, which is not yet understood.To elucidate the structural changes upon drying, the dryingprocess of the solvent-filled polymers was followed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS, in-house and at BESSY) ( Fig. 3). It was shown that the pores undergo drastic deformation(even in the fully cross-linked state) before the solvent actu-ally evaporates. This can be understood as a consequence ofthe different forces (elastic, interfacial) involved in theprocess. The finer details are subject to ongoing analysis. Fig. 3: left-hand side: photograph right-hand side:intensity (black) and s-value (grey) of the peak vs. time. The drasticchange of s max(which relates to > 10%) before the pore emptying sets in is obvious. The hard-templating pathway was also extended to other monomer systems. Ionic liquid type monomers based on vinylimidazolium were used in cooperation with the group ofJiayin Yuan [12]. The so-called poly(ionic liquids) are dis- cussed as materials with potential for CO 2separation and the impact of the mesostructure on the adsorption propertieswere studied. A significantly faster and higher adsorptionwas found, which can be attributed to the significantly short-er diffusion pathways. Beside the kinetic facts, there aresome peculiarities related to the adsorption thermodynamicsand the state of the adsorbed CO 2, which require additional analysis. Porosity Characterization The expertise of the group in the characterization of microp-orous materials by various methods has also led to a numberof cooperation projects with various partners. The main toolsare nitrogen and carbon dioxide adsorption studies and theuse of X-ray scattering, which can give additional information,even on disordered materials.

Bioconjugates and biohybrid copolymers are interesting materials for the generation of \"smart\" functional colloids and hierarchical structures, for usage in for instance life sci- ence applications (targeted drug delivery, tis- sue engineering, etc.). New materials based on amino acids, sugars, and terpenes have been prepared by advanced polymer synthesis tech- niques and studied according to their stimuli-respon- sive behavior and hierarchical self-assembly in aqueous heterocy-cles and be achieved under experimentally mild and benign condi-tions, i.e. in aqueous media at room temperature. Well-defined poly(2-oxazoline) (pseudo-polypeptide) star ionomers were readily brushes on inorganic substrates (gold surfaces and glass fibers) were prepared by the thiol-initiated pho-topolymerization of vinyl monomers [7, 12]. biohybrid Stimuli-Responsive (Smart) and glucosylated L-/DL-allyl- or DL-propargylglycinewere studied in dependence of solution pH. The glucosylated and non-glucosylated samples adopted random coil confor-mation at and /H9251-helical conformation in acidic media, the helical content depending on the number and configuration of allyl-/propargylglycine units. The gluco- copolypeptides revealed enhanced helical stability and solu- bility down to pH 3.5 ( Fig. 2). Furthermore, turbidity assaysdemonstrated selective binding to the plant lectin concan a -valin A [16]. Fig. 2: pH-dependent mo-responsive behavior in water. The poly- mers precipitated or coagulated upon heating, due to the dehy-dration of PEO chains, and re-dispersed upon cooling. Further-more, betulinyl-(PEO) 2with short PEO chains (11 repeat units) showed dual thermo-responsive behavior, precipitating at hightemperature and turning into hydrogel at low temperature( Fig. 3). Results suggested that the solution behavior was con- trolled by the type of terpene and polymer architecture [13].

The thermo-responsive behaviors of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)star ionomers in water were studied according to effects ofpH, ionic strength, and type of salt. The cloud point tempera-tures varied in a wide temperature range, from 10 to >95 \u00b0C,corresponding with the Hofmeister salt series and ionizationdegree of the core ( Fig. 4).

The investigation of structure/property rela- tionships and chemical synthesis/structure relationships of both natural and synthetic colloidal materials and interfaces is impor- tant for the development of new materials for analytical and technical applications. Transmission electron microscopy and high- resolution scanning electron microscopy are suit- able techniques to investigate micro- and nano-struc- tured synthetic and inorganic membranes, composite materials andnaturally-grown biomaterials. The determination of structuralparameters such as the size and size distribution of colloidalparticle systems, the pore size of polymeric and inorganicnetworks, the diameter of fibrillar nanostructures, the spatialarrangement of particles are in focus on the electron micro-scopic investigations. In combination with energy-dispersiveX-ray spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy is a power-ful analytical tool to determine relationships between thelocal chemical composition and surface and interface struc-tures of solid materials. Because of the organisation of theinstitute, there are many closed cooperations between theelectron microscopy group and other research groups. Someof the interesting results of electron microscopic investiga-tions are presented here. Iron oxide nanoparticles have a relatively low magnetic saturation and metallic iron has a much higher saturationmagnetization, but is unsuitable for medical applications dueto its toxicity. An alternative, offering both high magnetic sat-uration and chemical stability, is iron carbide (Fe 3C) [1]. By dispersing an aqueous iron precursor within gelatine gel, itcould show that the polymer controls the nucleation of mag-netite nanoparticles within the gel matrix. The biopolymerdecomposes to form a carbon- and nitrogen-rich matrixaround the intermediary oxide nanoparticles. This reactivetemplate then induces carbothermal reduction of iron oxideto iron carbide. As an example for the general applicability ofthis method two biopolymers (chitosan and alginate) wereused as gel components to produce stable iron carbidenanoparticles in the range of 10 to 30 nm [1]. The high-reso- lution scanning electron microscopic results show theiron carbid nanoparticles were embedded in an amorphousmatrix ( Fig. 1). Elemental analysis showed over a half of the mass to be composed of carbon (27 wt.%) and nitrogen (28 wt.%), sugges -ting that the amorphous matrix was formed from decomposition products of the gelatine starting material. The particle struc- ture was confirmed using transmission electron micros copy and themean particle diameter calculated to be d = 20\u00b12 nm. Another interesting project is the electron microscopic characterization of the structure of Pickering emulsions. For the preparation of a stable oil in water emulsion the solidnano particles should be able to wet the oil, as well as thewater phase.Fig. 1: Iron carbide nanoparticles synthesized using iron acetate in ammonium alginate precursor gel. Therefore the surface chemistry of the particles must be manipulated in a proper way [2]. Here the polyacid poly(methacrylic acid sodium salt) and the polybase poly(ally- lamine hydrochloride) are used for Using high-resolution cryo-scanning electron microscopy the sample preparation takes place at very low temperatures(<173 K) and the aqueous and the oil phases are in solidstate. The modified solid colloids are covering the oil phasecompletely and stabilizing the emulsion droplets ( Fig. 2). An important project is the local modification surface structure of soft matter with laser light. Here we have inves-tigated a method of incorporating laser responsive heat cen-ters, gold nanoparticles, into flake like microparticles assem-bled from fullerene derivative [3]. The samples were prepared by centrifugation of gold nanoparticle together with fullerenederivative based microparticles.

Upon laser irradiation at 532 nm, the hybrid microparticle melts due toplasmonic heating of gold nanoparticles and the flower-likemicroparticle will smoothen the surface ( Fig. 3b), which lead to a loss of hydrophobicity. Although in principle, fullerenederivative absorb light at 532 nm and could lead to a melting,it is suffice to mention that at intensity used here the meltingdoes not occur ( Fig. 4). The incorporation of laser responsive agents, can be used to selectively modify the morphology and the physical proper-ties of the microparticles.

One of our research activities is focused in the development of a coating system, including a non-chromate conversioncoating layer and a self-priming top coating containing non-toxic corrosion inhibiting components for high-strength alu-minum alloys [4]. Moreover, the presence of some alloying elements such as copper and surface defects particularly increases pitting corrosion attack by forming galvanic cou- ples. To detect the surface defects and spatial distribution of the alloying elements scanning electron microscopy in combi-nation with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used.Fig. 5shows the surface morphology (a) and the partial phase separated structure of a polished uncoated aluminum alloy(b), where the matrix is rich in aluminium (coloured in teal)and the red coloured areas are rich in copper.

Introduction Porous carbon materials are becoming of increasing interest to the developing appli- cation fields of energy storage [1](e.g. elec- trodes for Li ion batteries or supercapaci- tors), fuel cells (e.g. novel catalysts or cata- lyst supports for the oxygen reduction reaction) [2]or chromatography technologies. [3] With the development of modern technology and the need of better preforming materials, a larger number of new carbon materials with well-defined nanostructures havebeen synthesised by various nanotubes (CNTs), graphitic onions,carbon coils, carbon fibers, and others. To date, it is probablyfair to say that researches on carbon materials are encounter-ing the most rapid development period. Despite its wide spreading and naturally occurrence on Earth, carbon has been mainly synthesised from fossil basedprecursors. Pressures of an evolving sustainable society areencouraging and developing awareness amongst the materi-als science community of a need to introduce and developnovel porous media technology in the most benign, resourceefficient manner possible. Carbon has been created from bio-mass form the very beginning throughout the process of coalformation. Nature is mastering the production of carbons frombiomass and we only need to translate it into a syntheticprocess. Hydrothermal Carbonisation (HTC) HTC is not a new concept, but was first introduced by Bergiusin 1913 who described the transformation of cellulose intocoal-like materials. [4]However, while the Bergius process was based on the liquefaction of coal for the production ofbiofuels, our research focus is the carbonisation of biomassfor the production of functional porous carbon materials. [5] HTC is a fascinating field of research, with much about it developed in the past seven years [6]but far more to be dis- covered. In simple terms, it is a mimic of natural coalificationon a timescale of hours rather than millions of years. [5a, 5c, 7] We recently added another pice of mechanistic understand-ing. [8]The term \"functional carbon\" inherently implies some sort of function, i.e. applicability of the material. Below I willgive a few examples of sustainable synthesis of porous materials and their applications.Emulsion Templated Macroporous Carbons as Electrodes for Enzymatic Biofuel CellsWe have designed carbon monoliths using an easy syntheticpathway based on High Internal Phase Emulsion (HIPE) as asoft-template to confine the polymerisation-hydrothermalcarbonisation of both saccharide derivatives and phenoliccompounds. After further thermal treatment under inertatmosphere, the as-synthesised macroporous \"Carbo-HIPEs\"feature interesting mechanical properties, together with highelectrical conductivity to 300 S.m -1. Moreover, these new conductive foams exhibit a hierarchical structure, associatedwith the presence of macro, meso- and micropores, leading tospecific BET surface areas and pore volumes up to730 m 2.g-1and 0.313 cm3.g-1respectively. In view of attractive structural characteristics and intrinsic properties, these macro-porous monoliths have been incorporated within electrochemi-cal devices, as modified thin carbon disc electrodes. Afterimmobilisation of glucose oxidase-based biocatalytic mixture,a promising improvement of the catalytic current density by afactor 2 compared to commercial glassy carbon electrodeswas observed towards electro-oxidation of glucose.

Indeed, while sulfur is an affordable andabundant element, his light weight leads to high theoreticalspecific capacity and energy density. A number of researcheson cathode materials for LSBs have been carried out in thelast decade. Composites made of sulfur and porous carbonhave been shown to significantly improve both energy densi-ties and cycling abilities. We focused herein on the synthesisof nanostructured carbons through the hydrothermal biomass-derived precursors, to an eco-efficient and cost-effective synthetic route. We synthesizedporous carbon hollow spheres (HSs) exhibiting ~80 nm inter-nal diameters and less than 10 nm thick nanostructuredshells. We have compared 3 different materials as positiveelectrodes in Li-S batteries: 1. hollow carbon spheres/S com-posites prepared by S melt diffusion; 2. hollow carbonspheres/S composites prepared by a simple mixture; 3. non-porous carbon spheres mixed with S. A fine control of theshell thickness and porosity allowed a simultaneous optimi-sation in the achieved specific powers, specific energies andcycling properties of the carbon-sulfur composite electrodes.The best results were obtained when using the hollowspheres infiltrated with S by melt diffusion (discharge capac-ity of 1000 mAh.g 1at the 1st cycle, maintains a discharge capacity of 600 mAh.g1at the 50th cycle). Even at a very high current density of 10C (=16750 mA.g1), our cathode showed a discharge capacity of 170 mAh.g1. If we assume that a full Li-S cell using HS contains 25 wt.% of Li 2S, this full cell will provide a specific energy of 460 Wh.kg1and a specific pow- er of 5000 W.kg1. Fig. 2: Carbon-based HS. The cycling stability of the composite made by melt diffusion method is indicated by circles. The cycling performance ofthe mixture of HS and S is indicated by squares, while the one associat-ed with the mixture of HTC non-hollow microspheres and S is indicatedby triangles.Sulfur and Nitrogen Doped Aerogels with Enhanced in the OxygenReduction ReactionWe have developed one-pot, hydrothermal synthesis of co-monomers, S-(2-thienyl)-L-cysteine (TC) and 2-thienyl carbox-aldehyde (TCA), were used for sulfur incorporation, while thenitrogen was provided by a gelating protein, i.e. ovalbumin. [10]This approach gave rise to distinct morphologies and varying doping levels of sulfur. Nitrogen-doping levels of 5wt% and sulfur-doping levels of 1 wt% (using TCA) to 4 wt%(using TC) were obtained. A secondary pyrolysis step was used to further tune the carbon aerogel conduc- tivity and heteroatom binding states. By comparing solelynitrogen-doped with nitrogen- and sulfur-doped carbon aero-gels, it was observed that the presence of sulfur improvesthe overall electrocatalytic activity of the carbon material inboth basic and acidic media. Other few examples from our research include the devel- opment of cellulose [11]or rye-straw [12]-based porous elec- trodes Lithium ion batteries, efficient CO 2adsorbents from algae [13]as well as upgrade of bio- wastes remaining from the production of bio-ethanol into electrodes for supercapac-itors.

Introduction Ceramic materials are largely present in our everyday life in many different fields, from (bio)medicine to electronics, catalysis, pho- tocatalysis, etc. Metal nitrides (MN) and metal carbides (MC) are a special class of ceramics with features extending oxides. Together with excellent mechanical properties and chemical stability MN/MC possess electrical conductivity and catalytic activity, which place them -func- tion-wise - between ordinary ceramics and pure metals.Despite this high potential, the use of MN/MC is still compa-rably limited, mainly due to synthesis limitations. Classicalapproaches require in fact very high temperatures, toxic pre-cursors or complicated multi-step processes. In the last fewyears, in our group alternative pathways have been designed,also allowing shaping and processing and several MN/MCnanoparticles and nanostructures have been produced fortargeted applications in a sustainable way [1]. Nanoparticles for Energy ApplicationsIn a word in constant evolution, scientists have the delicateissue to provide suitable materials to fulfill the contemporarynecessities. This is especially important in energy relatedmatter, where valid alternatives to the current systems muststill be found. Also here, despite the wide range of possibili-ties, the attention is still mainly devoted to some selectedclasses of materials, while MN/MC could provide a validalternative to other well-establish systems (metals and noblemetals for instance). In order to produce a variety of MN/MCstructures in a sustainable way, a sol-gel-type process wasset up using suitable N/C sources (from small molecules likeurea to polymers like gelatine), which also act as stabilizingagents. The attention was focused on energy related materi-als, particularly interesting for classical and novel catalyticprocesses Chemistry (Chemistry Department, University of Palermo, Italy)2005:PhD, Chemistry (Chemistry Department, University of Palermo, Italy)Thesis: Physico-Chemical Investi gationof Nanoparticles Confined in Micro heterogeneous Systems2005-2007: Professor Assistant (Chemistry Department, Palermo) 2007-2008: Post-doc (Max Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces, Potsdam)Since October 2008: Group Leader (Max Planck and Interfaces, Potsdam)2011:Winner of the Zsigmondy Stipen- dium of German Society. Novel Synthetic Routes for Nanoparticles ProductionDE NOVO NANOPARTICLES From Paper to Carbon Electrodes by Printing Bio-structures display a high degree of complexity and can beused to bring features such as porosity, high surface area andcomplex design into a final ceramic material. With this aim, asimple synthesis toward hierarchical microstructures of mag-netic iron carbide (Fe 3C) starting from pure cellulose was de - signed. In this study, ordinary filter paper was turned intomesostructured iron carbide/graphene nano-assemblies withhigh structural perfection. Shape retention at the macroscopicscale was also proved by calcination of a \"crane-origami\" ( Fig. 2) previously embedded in a Fe sol- precursor solution. In thesecomposites the iron carbide gives processability and shape. Fig.2: An origami (paper) crane previously soaked in a suitable iron salt solution then calcined, turns in a magnetic object (and thus attracted bya rectangular magnet, left) made of small Fe 3C nanoparticles embedded in a graphitic matrix (inset, right) Furthermore, by using the paper as a support and combining it with a catalytic ink (by ink-jet printing), functional carbon/ceramic arrays and 3D structures were produced. The pro -cess allows turning mere cellulose into mesostructuredgraphene nano-assemblies and can be used as the basis forfurther processing, for instance copper electro-deposition [3]. Fig. 3: A) Printed sample, B) after calcination, C) after copper depositionTowards Hybrid Systems: Fe 3C@ILs After progresses toward sustainable synthesis as purephase, the production of MN/MC based hybrids and/ornanocomposites (by functionalization with a suitable secondphase) was a further step in our research. The coupled phasecan be a poly-ionic liquid (PILs) or a carbon phase, and canact as a mere dispersant but can also facilitate further pro-cessing (e.g. casting or coating) [4]. For instance, nanoparti- cles with magnetic properties embedded in a PIL matrix, cou-ple the magnetic properties with the PIL characteristics [5]. Fig.4: Fe 3C nanoparticles dispersed in water can be attracted by an external magnet, while stay stably dispersed in a PIL solution. C. Giordano , G. Clavel, S.

In such a structural configuration, some of the unique prop- erties of ILs are brought to the polymer chains. Mean- while the general properties of polymers are preserved. This generates a unique type of functional polymer materials.Nowadays PILs are catching steadily increasing interest in nu -merous applications in a broad range, such as solid polyme ricion conductor, universal stabilizer, microwave adsorbingagents, CO 2capture, electroactuator, etc. Our group is dedicat- ed to making new structured PILs, and applying them as/in car-bon precursor, thermoresponsive soft matters, and catalysis. PILs as Carbon Precursor Imidazolium- and pyridinium-based ILs have been used asvaluable carbon precursor due to their negligible vapor pres-sure, high thermostability and abundance in heteroatoms.The advantage of PILs over ILs in the carbon production lies inthe shape controllability at various length scales. PILs werepreviously reported produce metal salts as acti-vation agent. In our current research activities, metal saltswere excluded to hold the heteroatoms to modulate theirchemical and electric properties. In one example, via electro-spinning technique, nitrogen doped carbon fibers and mem-branes were synthesized from PILs with well-defined chemi-cal structures ( 1). In or vinylpyri- dinium type PILs with an allyl functionality and a dicyanamideanion in each repeating unit were electrospun into fiberstogether with trithiol crosslinker molecule (TRIS) (ACVA). were radically crosslinkedand then carbonized at 1000 \u00b0C to form nitrogen doped car-bon fibers and membranes.

The right side presents the SEM images of anitrogen-doped carbon monolayer and a freestanding membrane. PILs as Thermoresponsive Polymers Ion responsiveness of PILs is a well-known feature. The ther-mal switching behavior of PILs currently catches huge atten-tion, however less is known. We studied the low critical solu-tion temperature (LCST) behaviour of an anionic neutral a stable transition temperature, PTPSS changesits transition temperature in a wide range upon concentrationvariation. Fig. 2illustrates that the cloud point (T CP) for PTPSS was 82 \u00b0C at 20 g/L, and decreased gradually to 67, 61 and52 \u00b0C at 50, 100 and 200 g/L. In all cases, the phase transi-tion was very sharp.

While KBr shifted the transition to high tem-peratures, tetrabutylphosphonium bromide and the monomersalt could lower it down even to room temperature. Indeed,the LCST-type phase transition of PTPSS is very unique and isdependent on the polymer concentration and externalsalts.PIL copolymers could show also tunable and designableLCST-like solution behavior. Fig. 3displayed double stimuli- responsiveness of a PIL copolymer poly(NIPAM-co-1-ethyl-3-vinylimidazolium [poly(NIPAM-co-EVIm-Br)] in aqueous solution. The copolymer remained stable inaqueous solution upon heating or adding KBr salt, as the oth-er non-stimuli affected part always takes over the stabilizingrole. Only the simultaneous combination of both effects coulddestabilize the solutions with a precisely adjustable T cpin a wide temperature window by tuning the copolymer composi-tion and the ionic strength. Such a solution behaviour was asynergistic effect of the PNIPAM fraction, a LCST-type neu-tral polymer with a transition temperature at 32 \u00b0C and thebromide-containing PIL, a polyelectrolyte sensitive to ionicstrength. This \"double key principle\" could be coupled withthe stabilization function of the PIL to process carbon nan-otubes. By stabilizing carbon nanotubes with this type of mul-ti-responsive copolymers, the aqueous stability of CNTs isvariable over a wide temperature range.

PILs in Catalysis PILs can work as catalyst, catalyst support or pre-catalyst.Our group focused in the last two years on the supportingfunction of PILs in catalysis. Due to the charge feature, PILs can stabilize catalytically active metal nanoparticles. Forexample, a spherical PIL brush system based on a crosslinkedpolystyrene core and densely grafted poly(1-ethyl-3-vinylimi-dazolium bromide) shell could serve efficiently as support fornoble metal nanoparticles, such as Pt or gold. The catalyticsystem based on PIL-Pt could catalyze the reduction of nitro-phenol, a widely found pollutant in industrial waste water, bysodium borohydride. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of themetal nanoparticles embedded in the PIL spherical brusheswas found to be modulated by externally added salt. A signif-icant decrease in the catalytic activity was observed at highNaBr concentration. In another system, porous interpolyelectrolyte complex nanostructures of cationic PIL and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)were tested as catalyst support for aerobic oxidation reaction.The complex was prepared via a novel precipitation route viadropping a mixture solution of PIL and PAA in DMF into etha -nolic ammonia solution ( Fig. 4). Fig. 4: Synthetic route to micro/mesoporous PIL complex based on poly(3-cyanomethyl-1-vinylimidazolium) PILs and PAA, and their applica-tion for aerobic oxidation of organic compounds. The porous materials, termed poly(ionic liquid) complex (PILC) was precipitated out because of the in-situneutralization of PAA and the corresponding complexation of PAA with poly(3-cyanomethyl-1-vinylimidazoliumbis(trifluoromethanesul-fonyl)imide)) in a non-aqueous medium. Nitrogen sorptionmeasurements indicated a total specific surface area of up to310 m 2/g in these PILC materials. The PILC materials could load copper salts in an unconventional ion pair binding mode,which allowed for an uptake of 25 wt% of CuCl 2into the PILC matrix. The resulting hybrids were used as an effective het-erogeneous catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of hydrocar-bons under mild conditions. Both high activity and selectivitywere achieved for this catalytic system. J. Yuan, D. Kuzmicz, J. M. Balach, K. Grygiel, Q. Zhao, S. and carbon precursor. Eur. 47, 772-781 Introduction Organic conjugated oligomers and polymers are an important class of semiconductor materials, attracting great interest in appli- cations such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), photovoltaics, organic field effect transistors, electrochromic devices and sen- sors. Optimization of a device performance is a major challenge in this field and there is a range of electronic and structural features that can be manipulated to improve a material's suitability towards a particular device.The design and construction of an ideal material for organicsemiconductor devices requires careful consideration of arange of physical properties. Conjugated microporous poly-mers (CMPs) offer the same advantages of polymers, with extended -systems where the elec- tronic levels can be controlled rendering materials that aresemiconducting and have a wealth of applications. Further-more, and given the distinct morphological properties ofCMPs, (including porosity and high surface areas) -conju- gated microporous materials have been gaining more andmore attention recently. CMPs have been widely studied inareas such as gas separation and storage, taking advantageof their high surface areas and porosity. More recently, conju-gated polymer networks are making their way into catalyticsystems as heterogeneous catalysts. The general concept of our research is to develop novel pho- toactive conjugated polymer networks, (CMPs) with a highlevel of control over their electronic and structural propertiesfor application in Heterogeneous Photocatalysis, an impor-tant technology in solar energy conversion and sustainablechemistry. BackgroundHaving established the potential for photoinduced chargetransfer of a CMP to an acceptor molecule, it is valid toassume that this class of materials has the potential to act asheterogeneous photocatalysts (on their own merit) and/or asmetal catalyst supports (again heterogeneous). Indeed, ourcurrent research in this field has made some notable break-throughs where a novel CMP synthesized has shown to beable to act as a photosensitizer in the production of singletoxygen for ene type reactions. This poses a major advance-ment as current photosensitizers are generally dissolved inthe reaction media and once the reaction is completed thedesired product is obtained via costly and cumbersome sepa-ration techniques in order to remove the catalyst. With theCMP, a simple filtration is sufficient to remove it from thereaction media and this heterogeneous photocatalyst can bereadily reused without significant loss of its catalytic activity.

The rea-soning behind the choice of the reaction will be determinedby the energetic levels, (HOMO and LUMO), of the CMPs thatmeet the requirements for a particular reaction. Also, andonce the structural factors that determine the photocatalyticactivity have been identified, novel CMPs will be synthesizedaccordingly. Synthesis and characterization of novel CMPswith a high level of control of their morphological propertiesis also fundamental for a high performing heterogeneouscatalysis. Surface area, pore size and pore volume (includingpore connectivity and percolation within the material) influ-ence the interfacial level where the catalytic event takesplace. Synthesizing CMPs in the presence of silica nanoparti-cles (for instance) can provide a useful method to templatethe polymeric material, increase its surface area and achievedefined pore size once the template is removed. Syntheticpost-modification of the CMPs can also help control surfacearea and introduce new features that include water compati-bility of the CMP and coordination sites to metal nanoparti-cles (application of photocatalytic reactions in water and inthe absence of volatile organic compounds, VOCs, is again inline with sustainable and green chemistry). Also, metalnanoparticles can be incorporated into the polymer voids inorder to enhance and access different photocatalytic reac-tions. Ultimately, and having achieved important milestones,such as control of electronic and morphological properties ofthe CMPs; ensure the chemical stability of the polymerframework during photocatalysis; incorporation of inexpen-sive and abundant metal nanoparticles within the porousmaterials; photocatalyze organic reactions in polar solventsand water and in the absence of VOCs; the aim will be todevelop a material (or combination of materials) that can cat-alyze economical and sustainable reactions which replacetraditional and expensive metals (palladium, ruthenium, iridi-um, etc.) such as in carbon-carbon formation, epoxidation ofolefins, CO 2reduction and water-splitting directly using solar light as the source of photons. F. Vilela, L. Chabanne, L. Jia, H. General Strategy Interfaces are most important on one hand to understand and control colloidal systems with their large fraction of specific surface, on the other hand most processes start at an interface, and therefore they determine many physical and chemical properties. From a basic science point of view they exhibit peculiarities as low - dimensional systems and are anisotropic sys- tems where molecules can be oriented. Macromolecules like proteins and peptides may change their secondary and tertiarystructure and thus their function at interfaces. Within the insti-tute`s strategy of building and understanding hierarchicalstructures they are positioned at the lowest length scale whichone may also consider the base. Accordingly the main aim ofthe department is to understand and to control molecular inter-faces as regards structure, dynamics and properties. As an off-spring of this the knowledge could be used to prepare complexfilms, coated colloids and capsules. For this the departmenthas established a zoo of techniques to characterize colloids andinterfaces and, especially concerning studies of liquid inter-faces, we are probably best equipped world - wide. The latteris also due to the fact that there has been a continuous devel-opment of methods over years. Part of these developments hasbeen commercialized within four start-up companies. As a general trend in all groups the interfaces increase in complexity, i.e. planar interfaces mostly also contain proteins,polypeptides or nanoparticles. If the interface contains onlysmall molecules the dynamics is of prime importance. This con-cerns reorganization of molecules, their diffusion as well ascollective motion like flow under a surface pressure gradient. On the other hand the mission is also to concentrate on basic science and therefore schemes had to be developed totransfer technology and knowledge to groups and partnersoriented towards application. The research concerns predominantly experiments between chemistry and physics with little molecular synthesisand biology, and also theory is mostly employed only in col-laborations. It has been organized within five groups whichare largely independent from the director but interact with mein varying intensity. Some scientists are also under my directsupervision which has been in special necessary when thegroup leader had left or if there was a topic to be taken up independent of the immediate interest of a specific group. II. Research Highlights II. 1 Planar Interfaces The specially advanced expertise and methodology to study Langmuir monolayers at the air/water interface has beenmade use of in many model studies of systems interesting forvarious type of applications, to name but a few:\u00b7 It was shown that the formation of beta sheets of specifi- cally designed peptides is influenced by different cations(Cu, Zn) as well by the interface where they are located. Inall cases studied interfacial forces dominated the ionic forces (cooperation Prof. B. Koksch, FU Berlin).\u00b7 New zwitterionic phospholipid membranes have been developed that appear most suitable for DNA transfection(coop. Prof. Dobner, Univ. Halle). This cooperation has nowbeen extended by a company interested in RNA delivery. \u00b7 As most exciting new direction I consider studies of mono- layers of lipids with designed carbohydrate head groupssynthesized in the group of V. da Silva in the department ofBiomolecular Systems. C. Stefaniu in the Brezesinski group by grazing incidence X-Ray diffraction observed a crystallinelattice of the carbohydrates in addition to the one of hydro-carbon chains. In cooperation with M. Santer from the Theory department the structure that is determined byhydrogen bonds could be solved. This opens new ways ofcooperation between 3 departments where the molecularrecognition of this attractive class of molecules can be stud-ied with atomic resolution, including the consequences forcoupled enzymatic reactions at membrane surfaces ( Fig. 1). The group of R. Miller has been continuing their studies of thermodynamics and rheology of charged amphiphiles atwater/air and water/oil interfaces. By systematic variation ofthe chain length they demonstrate that the adsorptionisotherms can only be described by a Frumkin model that isextended by a term taking into account the Coulomb interac-tions of the head groups and the corresponding ion cloud.This model is also successful to describe surface rheology. By systematically varying the chain length of alcanes and aliphatic oil they could show that the continuous film ofdetergent at the oil/ water interface incorporates the oil onlyif the oil has a specific chain length. This is understood as acompromise between van-der Waals forces and entropicforces that oppose the incorporation and orientation of theoil in the surfactant film ( Fig. 2). The relevance of these stud- ies for emulsion stabilization is reflected in various industri-al co-operations of the group.Research in the Department Jose) 1975:Research Assistant (University of Ulm)1978:Habilitation, Physics (University of C4, Physical Chemistry, (University of Mainz)Since 1993: Director and Scientific Member (Max Planck Institute ofColloids and Interfaces, Potsdam)Since 1995: Professor, Physics and Physical Potsdam)Since 2001: Honorary Professor (Zheijang University, Hangzhou)Since 2004: Honorary Professor (Fudan University, Shanghai)Since 2006: Honorary Professor (Institute of Chemistry at the ChineseAcademy of Sciences, Beijing) 98Fig.1 Fig.2The group of H. Riegler has very much refined their optical and force microscopic observations of nucleation and growth of liquid bubbles on structured surfaces, thus yielding mostquantitative data on interfacial interactions. They demon-strate that melting at steps on a surface may proceed by anucleation and growth scenario which differs from that onflat surfaces or in bulk (coop. dept. Theory). In model studiesof spin coating they calculate concentration profiles develop-ing during the process and show that precipitates form at theliquid/air and liquid/solid interface. The latter can in additionbe controlled by suitable surface structuring at the nm level.This is most relevant for a cooperation project with HelmholtzCenter Berlin where nanosized aggregates of the phthalocya-nines are used to fabricate bulk heterojunction solar cells. They show that the contact angle of small droplets depends on their size and derive a model from which theyobtain the line tension. They can quantitatively describe thesize dependence of the contact angle by long range van derWaals forces assuming reasonable Hamaker constants. They observe fast or delayed coalescence of sessile droplets of water/ oil mixtures. It depends little on viscosity butdrastically on the surface tension difference. This indicates theimportance of Marangoni flow and a corresponding model hasbeen developed (coop. TU Cottbus). The quantitative descrip-tion has been very much refined, and also the experiments havebecome most sophisticated by measuring the flow, controllingtightly environmental conditions (T, humidity) and numericallysolving the corresponding hydrodynamic nonlinear equations( Fig. 3). Much of the work has been published in high impact journals, but it has also attracted industry funding, in special forwafer cleaning. ( Fig. 3) Fig.3 II. 2 Non-Planar InterfacesThe group of D. Shchukin has been engaged in basically two directions. (A) Development of stimuli sensitive nanocontainers to be embedded in enabling the development of self-repairing coatings and studies of functions of self-repairing coatings. (B) Development of sonochemistry as a tool for surface modi - fication. Under (A) nanotubular (halloysite) or nanoporous were developed that via a polyelectrolyte multilayer shellexhibited stimuli sensitive release of incorporated corrosioninhibitors. Also polymeric capsules were developed via particlestabilized oil droplets (Pickering emulsions). After embedding ina coating they then could show that the different local pH neara defect can cause inhibitor release and thus annealing. It couldbe shown that size (between .5 and 5 mikrom.) and location ofparticles are most relevant for optimum corrosion protection.These studies are most promising for applications and will bepursued partly removed from the institute's main stream withthe aim of developing a start-up company. The activities under (B) were concentrated on determin- ing the importance of surfaces to control cavitation. It wasshown by microcontact printing that bubble nucleation inwater can be confined to hydrophobic surface areas, and thiswill enable new ways of in-situ studies that are now inprogress. Meanwhile it has been possible to quantify thecavitation density and to observe nanobubbles on a patternedsurface by scanning force microscopy ( Fig. 4) as well as by optical microscopy (V. Belova in coop. U. G\u00f6ttingen). Fig. 4 The group of A. Skirtach has been most successful in making use of plasmonic interactions of metal nanoparticles andmetal films. It has been made use of into three differentdirections:\u00b7 Following previous work on local heating by IR absorption Au nanoparticles were adsorbed to erythrocytes and cells toinduce release of molecules from inside. This work has nowbecome very elaborate to study the effect on certain chan-nel proteins (coop. Charite and Jacobs Uni Bremen). Fig.5: \u00b7 The high optical field enhancement near metal nanoparti- cles is well known. Adsorbing these particles into poroussilica spheres one can achieve a high local density of theseparticles inside cells, and they are reachable by moleculesinside the cell. This enables Raman detection and imagingof cellular components with light intensities close to sunlight (coop. dept. Biomaterials). \u00b7 Via light induced melting patterns of nanoparticle distribu- tions can be produced on a surface. As these change thesurface mechanical properties also cell attachment followsthis pattern. As alternative way singlet oxygen may be pro-duced by light via the particles, and this in turn effects thegrowth and death of cells leading to cellular patterns (coop.University Bayreuth, dept. Biomaterials) 99 Top V iew Drop 2 Drop 1t<0vNt>0 Hole In the joint German-French lab on sonochemistry sonolumi- nescence spectra could be obtained from single bubblesexisting of broad emission of a continuum from which a plas-ma temperature could be derived and the narrow emissionfrom atomic or radical species, both depending drastically onthe acoustic pressure. For rare earth ions it was shown thatthese ions were part of the plasma and not in the adjacentwater phase .The work in this collaboration is now alsoextended towards composites of hydrogels in cooperationwith the Biomaterials department. Fig. 6: The work on cavitation has been successfully extended by 2postdocs (V. Belova, Lu Zhang) to online measure cavitationand to quantify the influence of geometric surface features oncavitation. On the other hand cavitation has been extensivelyused to prepare porous surfaces (E.V. Skorb, Fig. 6) This off- spring of the Shchukin group is now systematically extended toload the pores with drugs and to observe the response of cellattachment and growth (coop. Biomaterials). As a most curiosity driven structure microtubes from designed peptides have been produced, and their structureresolved with molecular resolution (X.H. Yan). It was shownthat these tubes can guide optical waves, but it will last forlong till a physician will use the deposable light guide in anoperation. III. Future Development Major changes of staff in the last two years have been: \u00b7 In 2011 A.G. Skirtach accepted a professorship in Bio - photonics at University Gent. Members of the group are still working in the institute, engaged in many cooperations. \u00b7 In 2012 D.G. Shchukin accepted a call for a chair at Uni - versity Liverpool. Also his group continued working on the many well-funded projects in the institute. \u00b7 X.H. Yan has received a professorship from the 1000 young talents program and just starts at the Institute of Process Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. Continuing collaboration with these groups it has been pos- sible to maintain a size of about 50 people, hence to further shrink the department only in its last year of existence.Because of the strong external funding it has also been pos-sible to finance this size in spite of the drastic reduction ofthe institutional funding. As it has not yet been possible to continue with five departments, the interfaces department will be terminatedwith my retirement in January 2014. This means that the re maining groups have to be transferred into the existing de part ments at Golm. It is obvious from this report that themono layer work of the Brezesinski already has many coopera-tions with all departments and also the Riegler group is wellconnected with theory, and so they may profit from this move. The work on self-repairing coatings (Shchukin) has very much matured that it also withstood industrial tests. Thereare now intensive trials to transfer this knowledge and thepeople involved into a company. If this will be successfuldepends more on business and marketing issues not on tech-nical ones. On the other hand the science concerning feed-back-loops is often found in nature, e.g. to regulate pH, concentration of ions, enzymes, drugs, temperature or poten-tial. Therefore it is not too surprising that it has carried D. Shchukin on a chair where he can broaden his research. The work on nanoplasmonics (Skirtach) has been profitingvery much from in-house and external collaborations, and isexpected to persist beyond my retirement above all in collab-oration with the Biomaterials department. The latter collabo-ration will also be very promising with sonochemical surfacetreatment to control cellular interactions, and E.V. Skorb is expected to move there. Major recognitions have been the award to X.H. Yan in the 1000 talents program and the election of R. Miller as president of the International Association of Colloids and Interfaces(IACIS). I have become member of the Academia Europaea. As mentioned before the department of interfaces will persist another year, and it is a good tradition that a retiringdirector has no influence on the future direction and persons.It is also most desirable not to continue the \"old\" directions.Therefore I will not comment on any future perspectives of thedepartment. On the other hand my colleagues are trying hardto maintain an institute with five departments and there isconsensus that this should focus in a broad sense on physicalchemistry. On the other hand I am satisfied that up to now theshrinking process has not encountered many personal hard-ships, as technicians, PhD students and postdocs found attrac-tive positions. This was possible, because of the world wideconnections of the department and of the institute as a whole. Of course I would be disappointed if physical chemistry of interfaces disappeared from the institute, more important-ly the Max Planck Society would not do wise to weaken aninstitute like ours this way. On the other hand I have no wor-ry about the specific field. It encounters tremendous progressworldwide, and we have a considerable contribution to this.There are meanwhile more than 100 alumni from the depart-ment on professor positions or equivalent academic posi-tions, and these will enhance science in the area. They allremember their time in the institute with pleasure andthanks, and therefore the time together has been worth it. Helmuth M\u00f6hwaldDirector of the Department of Interfaces 100 Biomimetic or bio-inspired functional materials with ordered organization at micro- or nanoscale, fabricated from peptidebuilding blocks, are of increasing importance due to theirpotential application in biomedicine and nanotechnology. Theself-assembled peptide superstructures with defined spatialdimensions hold great promise for creation of photonic orelectronic materials. In this work, peptide optical wave-guides were for the first time fabricated in the form of eithersolid platelets or hollow microtubes by confined assembly orcrystallization of pathogenic amyloid fibrils. Peptide wave-guides will naturally degrade and not leave any trace afterthey have acted as an optical element.Therefore, such functional structures ofmaterials fabricated through self-assemblyof versatile peptide molecules are advanta-geous in guiding light for biologically basedmodulation and sensing.

In particular, in our recent works [1-5]we suggested effective ultra- sonic assisted pathways of porous material for- mation (metals, silicon, hybrids and nanocomposites) which can find application for drug delivery vis-\u00e0-vis being used as capsules. In ( Fig. 1) is shown the suggested strategy for formation of surface capsules. Thus after ultrasonic treat-ment of an aluminum surface a mesoporous layer with goodadhesion to the bulk metal matrix is formed. The mesoporoussurface layer can be loaded with a variety of agents (corrosioninhibitors, biocides, enzymes, DNA fragments, antibodies).Thus, the loaded metal layer has functionality of porous cap-sules. Comparing to existing encapsulation systems the sur-face capsules continue the bulk metal and don't need to beimmobilized on the surface or incorporated into a protectivecoating. Furthermore, the rough surface of the metal capsulesprovides excellent adhesion of a protective coating. E.

[4]Ultrasound has received significant attention in the develop- ment of new functional materials and composite nanostruc-tures due to the distinctive effect of ultrasound on materials [1-3]. The understanding of ultrasonic cavitation on solid sur- faces can greatly advance the application of ultrasound.Currently, studies have been mainly focused on the evolutionof cavitation bubbles formed at planar surfaces [1-4]. Nevertheless, these results have not fully accounted for thegeometry of the surfaces as they neglect the contribution offeature shapes. To improve the understanding of the cavita-tion process, SiO 2particles of different sizes and shapes were irradiated under a series of ultrasonic parameters ( Fig. 1).Through observing different surface changesof particles resulting from cavitation, aspeculative mechanism of ultrasonic cavita-tion on particle surfaces was proposed.During bubble collapse, nano-sized particleswill become rough and small by the highvelocity collisions among particles whilemicron-sized particles can be broken due to themicrojets and associated shock waves applied onparticle surfaces.

Many parameters can be easily var- ied (composition, lateral packing density, sur- face pressure and area exposed to the medi- um, pH, salt concentrations, etc.). The interac- tions of dissolved biomolecules (DNA, peptides, enzymes) or nanoparticles [1-3]with lipid layers can be stud- ied using surface sensitive methods. The investigation of beta-sheet forming peptides (cooperation with B. Koksch, FUBerlin) [4, 5]as well as of antimicrobial peptides (cooperation with J. Andr\u00e4, Research Center Borstel) is ongoing. The studyof non-viral transfection systems (cooperation with B. Dobner,University of Halle) will also be continued [6, 7]. In this report, the main results of our work concerning /H9252-sheet forming peptides, new lipids designed for [9]will be described. Selected AchievementsTriggers for /H9252-Sheet Formation at the Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic Interface Early stages in the aggregation process have recently been considered the cell toxic steps in amyloid diseases.Aiming at understanding various triggers for /H9252-sheet forma- tion ( Fig. 1) such as peptide concentration, interactions with hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfaces, and metal ion complexa-tion and their interplay, we investigated a set of model pep- tides at the air/water interface. These peptides existing inunfolded structures in bulk transform immediately to /H9251- helices at the interface. Depending on the primary structureof the peptide, these intermediates can start to transforminto /H9252-sheets or can be extraordinarily stable compared to the fast aggregation of the peptides at similar concentrations in bulk. In general, the interface has the strongest effect onpeptide conformation compared to high peptide concentra-tions or metal ions. Metal ions are able to prevent aggrega- tion in bulk but not at the interface. The effectiveness of met-al ion complexation to enhance the conformational transfor-mation into /H9252-sheets or to stabilize the /H9251-helix is determined by the peptide primary sequence. For example, the binding ofZn 2+ions is strongly dependent on the possibility of chelate formation. Therefore, it additionally accelerates aggregationat the interface, when chelate formation is not possible inthe /H9251-helical state. Increased concentrations or a parallel arrangement of the /H9251-helical intermediates are more effec- tive triggers. Parallel alignment of concentrated /H9251-helices (transition from 2D isotropic to 2D nematic state) at the interface always leads to aggregation. A better know -ledge of these triggers may assist in understanding the fun-damental mechanisms of common diseases related to amy-loid formation (such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's dis-ease, or type II diabetes). Lipids for Gene Transfection: Important Features of LipofectionTo correlate structural characteristics of lipids with theirtransfection results is one important step to optimize the syn-thesis of cationic lipids (cooperation with B. Dobner, MLUHalle). For the first time, the binding of model DNA to lipidmonolayers was quantified by IRRAS. As an example, thephysical-chemical properties of two malonic acid amideswith completely different gene transfer activities will beshortly described. The compounds exhibit the same headgroup structure (lysine linked via ethylenediamine) but differ-ent aliphatic chain patterns. We identified the key parame-ters explaining the different transfer activities. First of all,membrane fluidity plays an important role in lipofection. Themiscibility behaviour with helper lipids, as cholesterol orDOPE, is another crucial parameter. In the present case, thelipid exhibiting strong van der Waals interactions betweenthe saturated chains as well as strong head group interac-tions via hydrogen bonds forms a sub-gel like phase withhigh packing density and incorporates much less cholesterol.Despite the fact that in literature the 3D structures of thelipoplexes are considered of utmost importance, our resultsshow that the transfection efficiency is not necessarilydepending on it. Both lipids form lamellar phases without andwith cholesterol. The addition of DNA does not change thephase type showing that non-lamellar phases are not crucialfor high transfection efficiency. The amount of DNA bound tomonolayers of these lipids is comparable at high and low pHvalues (at the same area per molecule) and is depending pre-dominantly on the charge density in the monolayer ( Fig. 2). 104 Gerald Brezesinski 02.04.1950 1974:Diploma, Biophysics (Lomonossow University of Moscow) Thesis: The parametric pump - a physical-chemical model of the active trans port of ions in cells1981:PhD, Physical Chemistry (Martin Luther University of ausgew\u00e4hlterPhospholipid-Wasser-Systeme1981-1982: Postdoc (Biological Research Scientist (Institute of Physical Chemistry,University of Halle/S.)1992-1995: Research Scientist (Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Mainz)Since 1995: Group Leader (Max Planck Institute of Colloids and 2009: 27, 1192-1199 (2011).

Yet,their membrane structure arrangement is still lacking a deepunderstanding. An unprecedented ordering in monolayers ofthe 1of GPIs Several Bragg peaks in the mid-to-wide angle region ( Fig. 3A) have been found. These peaks indicate a head group ordering ( Fig. 3B) that was not observed in any of the previous studies on double-chainphospholipids including phospholipids with head groups thatcan be engaged in hydrogen bonding interactions. Indexing ofall Bragg peaks revealed the existence of a supercell con-taining three molecules of 1(Fig. 3C). This structure is remi- niscent of the subgel phase structures observed in lipid dis-persions after partial dehydration of the head groups duringlong incubation periods at low temperature. Here, the headgroup ordering is observed since a hydrogen bond network isformed that rigidifies the monolayer structure. The networkof hydrogen bonds can be disrupted on highly concentratedurea subphases (urea acts as a chaotropic agent) leading torotational disorder of the head groups and therefore to theloss of the molecular lattice and the restructuring of thechain lattice ( Fig. 3D-F ). 2D Supramolecular and their supramolecular assemblies are materials ofhigh relevance in different fields as catalysis, energy storage,and medicine. Using a new class of POM-based surfactants,2D molecularly ordered supramolecular structures have beenbuilt at the air/water interface. The self-assembly of thePOM units is driven by the lateral interactions between POMmoieties. The crystalline structure formed by the polar headof the surfactants was quantitatively described for the firsttime ( Fig. 4). The hydrocarbon chains are in a condensed-like state for POMs with chain length between C22 and C16.Fig. 4: Top: Side-view of a interface. Bottom: Top-view: Hexagonal arrangement of the POM heads. Plans (1) Chemically modified phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) and glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) will be studied inpure and mixed systems in cooperation with our depart-ment of biomolecular systems (P. Seeberger, D. VaronSilva) and the theory department (M. Santer). These stud-ies are also performed with the vision to study enzymaticinteractions. (2) A new project studying the influence and function of chemically modified ceramides on the nanostructure anddynamics of stratum corneum model systems will be sup-ported by the DFG. Our part concerns structural investiga-tions of single and mixed 2D and 3D model systems.

One of the long- term targets is to specify interfacial proper- ties which correlate with the key parameters of corresponding foams and emulsions. During the last few years we have been studying intensively the adsorption of surfactants at the water/oil interface. In contrast to the water/air interface, the interac-tion between adsorbing surfactants and the molecules of theoil phase is of importance and may change with the chainlengths of the surfactant and the oil, respectively. In order toavoid any transfer of surfactant across the water/oil inter-face we selected a homologous series cationic surfac-tants, namely alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromides (C nTAB, n = 10, 12, 14, 16), as this class of surfactants has been exten-sively investigated at the water/air interface. The equilibrium adsorption isotherms of four members of this homologous series are shown in Fig. 1for the water/air and in Fig. 2for the water/hexane interface. In both graphs the experimental data are shown together with calculatedmodel isotherms model of the experimental data, while other modelsshow significantly larger deviations. Fig. 1: Surface tension isotherms of C 10TAB (1), C 12TAB (2), C 14TAB (3) and C 16TAB (4) at the water/air surface; solutions were prepared in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7); solid lines correspond to theoretical curves calculated with the Frumkin Ionic Compressibility model. The experiments have been performed in 10 mM phosphate buffer for two reasons. First, in this way the ionic strength ofthe solutions was essentially the same for all surfactants atall studied concentrations. Moreover, experiments are underway for mixed protein/C nTAB solutions, for which a fixed pH is required.Fig. 2: Interfacial tension isotherms of C 10TAB (1), C 12TAB (2), C 14TAB (3) and C 16TAB (4) at the water/hexane interface; solutions were prepared in the phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7); solid lines correspond to theo- retical curves calculated with the Frumkin Ionic Compressibility model. The analysis of the isotherms provides information about the surface coverage of the interfacial layer, or the required areaper adsorbed molecule, in dependence of the bulk concentra-tion c. Note, /H9275is the molar area really occupied by one adsorbed molecule and not the geometric area available atthe interface. As one can see in Fig. 3for the shortest chain surfactant C 10TAB, over the entire concentration range, the required area per surfactant molecule is larger at thewater/hexane as compared to the water/air interface. Fig. 3: C1 0TAB adsorbed amount (thin lines) and molar area (thick lines) at the water/air surface (blue) and water/hexane interface (red) versus bulk concentration c; model calculations were performed with theFrumkin Ionic Compressibility model. We can also note that a remarkable adsorption of the surfac- tant is already observed at the water/hexane interface at amuch lower bulk concentration (10 -4mol/l) than at the water/air interface (2x10-3mol/l). 106 Stay (St. Petersburg University with A.I.

The adsorption at the water/hexane interfacestarts to be measurable at a bulk concentration less than 10 -8 mol/l, while a real increase in the adsorbed amount at thewater/air interface sets in only at a concentration of about5x10 -6mol/l. At this concentration, the value of /H9275 slowly decreases, i.e. the molecules change step by step their meantilt angle. With increasing bulk concentration c, the molarareas and adsorbed amounts for both interfaces becomealmost identical, as we can see in Fig. 4. Fig. 4: C 16TAB adsorbed amount (thin lines) and molar area (thick lines) at the water/air surface (blue) and water/hexane interface (red) versus bulk concentration c; model calculations were performed with theFrumkin Ionic Compressibility model. From these findings we can conclude that for the short chain C10TAB the interfacial layer at the water/oil interface includes hexane molecules even at the highest surface cov-erage, i.e. close to the CMC. In contrast, for C 16TAB only at low surface coverage hexane molecules are intercalated intothe interfacial layer and then get squeezed out at higher sur-face coverage due to the stronger interaction between thelong alkyl chains of the surfactant molecules. For C 12TAB and C14TAB a transition from the behavior of a short to a longer alkyl chain is observed. Further investigations were made with alkanes of differ- ent chain lengths (from hexane to tetradecane) and the fourmembers of the homologous surfactants C nTAB in order to find out if there are transitions of the intercalation/squeezing out mechanism for the alkane molecules. The results can besummarized as shown in Scheme 1 . While the interaction between adsorbed C 10TAB molecules is not strong enough to squeeze out neither short nor long alkane molecules, this isthe case for C 12TAB for short alkanes. For dodecane and tetradecane, however, the interaction between alkane and surfactant is stronger than the mutual interaction betweenthe surfactants, and hence the oil molecules remain inter -calated.Scheme 1: Molecular interaction between surfactants and oil molecules of different alkyl chain lengths Complementary experiments were performed with surfactant solution drops formed in an alkane vapor atmosphere [3, 4]. Although alkane molecules are not amphiphilic, they adsorband change significantly the adsorption of the surfactantmolecules. Existing thermodynamic models allow a qualita-tive description. However, for a quantitative understanding anew thermodynamic model has to be developed that takesthe co-adsorption of surfactant and oil molecules intoaccount. The same physical picture might be applicable alsoto adsorbed layers at the interface between water and an oilbulk phase. This modelling work is presently underway. Additional experiments were performed with drop profile and capillary pressure tensiometry to study the adsorptiondynamics and dilational visco-elasticity C nTAB layers at the water/alkane interface [5, 6]. The results have shown that with the same set of thermodynamic parameters all dynamicproperties can be described. Agreement between experimentand theory was achieved, however, only when choosing con-centration dependent diffusion coefficients with physicallyrather unrealistic values. This also points to the fact that themodels existing so far reflect only qualitatively the situationat the interface and combined with an improved thermo -dynamics, also refined relaxation mechanisms have to bedeveloped to reach a quantitative understanding of the inter-facial dynamics. A new approach has been also started recently using CFD simulations of the processes happening at dynamic liquid interfaces [7, 8]. These simulations include also the description of growing and oscillating drops with a free inter-face and adsorption/desorption processes at this interface.Based on the Open-FOAM platform drop profiles under vari-ous conditions can be calculated. These results will giveaccess to a modification of the Gauss-Laplace-Equation validalso in a respective range of Reynolds numbers and a speci-fied capillary geometry for forming the drops. R.

Physical Chemistry Dept.University of Mainz1995:Habilitation Since 1994: Research Group Leader, Department of Interfaces, Max Planck Institute of Colloids andInterfacesWe are interested in a better understanding of nucleation/aggregation phenomena and in the coupling between volume flow and surface Marangoni-flow caused by interfa- cial energy gradients. Nucleation and aggre- gation phenomena are ubiquitous (from cloud formation to metallurgy). Liquid flows induced by surface tension gradients are also widely rele- vant e.g. for ink jet printing. Our primary aim is a bet- ter fundamental scientific understanding of these issues. Nucleation and growth studies are performed within an international graduate school (funded by DFG) in collabora- tion with universities in the Berlin area and academic part-ners in the US (NC State University). The Marangoni-flowactivites are embedded in a collaboration with Twente Uni -versity (NL). A \"by-product\" of this collaboration is a suc-cessful study on nanobubbles [1]. Based on our expertise on nucleation, growth and Marangoni-induced transport/flow, wefurther started collaborations with French research groups onpit corrosion (CEA, Saclay) and on separation chemistry (ICSM,Marcoule). The focus is on basic research but there are alsoactivities motivated by application. We collaborate withindustry (LAM Research) to investigate the fundamentals ofMarangoni cleaning, and we use our knowledge to optimizethe architecture of molecularly thin films in organic solarcells (project funded by the BMBF). Line Tension Line tension effects can become relevant when interfacialenergies are substantial compared to volume free energycontributions. This only occurs for very small, nano size ses-sile drops (or adsorbed aggregates). Minimizing the total freeenergy leads size-dependently to different equilibriumshapes e.g. the equilibrium contact angles depend on size. Tofirst order the effect can be parameterized with the curvatureof the contact line, hence \"line tension\". Experimental verifi-cations of line tension effects are scarce. We measured thiseffect [2]with very small aggregates of C60 on various mole- cularly smooth surfaces ( Fig. 1). Although theoretically predicted since a long time, a general palpable theory of line tension based on intermolec-ular interactions is still missing. We develop such anapproach. The predicted variation of the shape with size is inagreement with the experimental results ( Fig. 1). Essentially, a line tension effect occurs when the variation of the interfa- cial force field contributions with drop size are comparable to the volume force field contributions. The variation of the interfacial force field is dominated by contributions from thecontact line region, hence \"line\" tension. Line tension effects can be regarded as resulting from a locally varying, size- dependent disjoining pressure. A) B) Fig. 1: A) AFM image of small aggregates and measured variation of their contact angle area with size [2]. B) Model and theoretical results. Heterogeneous Nucleation First order phase transitions implicate the formation of aninterface between the old and the new, emerging phase. Thiscauses a supplemental energy, a nucleation barrier for thetransition. The nucleation is heterogeneous when the emerg-ing phase is in contact with other (inert) phases in addition tothe interface between old and new phase. Compared to thehomogeneous case the energy barrier for heterogeneousnucleation is lower. This lowering is parameterized usuallyonly by the contact angle between emerging and inert sur-face. However this single parameter approach only works forsimple planar geometries. If the topography between emerg-ing phase and inert template is non-planar, the nucleationbarriers and paths also depend on the topographic details ofthe template. Fig. 3: Nucleation path of edge melting with a transition from a plain to a bulged channel (the bulges grow into macroscopic drops). Comparisonbetween the nucleation barriers for various morphologies. Phase Transitions and Transport Phenomena 20 [nm\u00b3] Contact Angle [deg]30 SiO2 Radius (nm)Contact Angle (deg) 204 06 08 0 010203040 0 Contact Angle (deg) Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations [3] with nucleation templates with edges and grooves explicitly reveal how the nucleation barriers and pathways depend onthe height and length of steps/grooves. In addition we findthat with templates of reduced symmetry (e. g. long steps orgrooves), the nucleation path with the lowest energy may benon-isomorphic. That means, as during the evolution fromsubcritical to supercritical (bulk) volumes, the new phasenucleus changes its shape (e.g. from a plain channel tobulges, ( Fig. 3)). Up to now, all theoretical nucleation scenar- ios always assumed isomorphic volume growth for the low-est energy nucleation path. Fig. 4: C60 aggregates on nano-patterned SiO 2-substrate Heterogeneous nucleation is also investigated with planarsolid substrates that were pre-structured with an array ofnano-indents. Unexpectedly it is observed that upon spincasting from solution precipitated C60 aggregates form pref-erentially in the dents ( Fig. 4). The dents are less than 1nm deep and the estimated reduction of the nucleation barrier bythe dent geometry is quite small. To gain better insight intothe spatio-temporal evolution of the nonvolatile solute (C60)during the film thinning - which in the end leads to theobserved phenomena - the spin casting process itself isanalysed theoretically [4]. Fig. 5: Phytalocyanine net structures (height 1.5nm)Phtalocyanine-Films for Organic Solar CellsMolecularly thin films of Phtalocyanines (PC) were preparedwith structures optimized for Heterojunction Organic SolarCells (OSC) [5]. The PCs form interesting films with ribbon- like bundled multilayer net structures ( Fig. 5). A detailed experimental analysis and model calculations reveal thenucleation and growth processes leading to the observedstructures. With these films functioning OSCs were preparedvia solution processing [6]. Interfacial Flow and lateral contact, sessile drops of miscible liquids areexpected to merge rapidly due to capillary forces. With dif-ferent liquids in both drops, upon contact, surface tensiongradients form in the connecting region. This induces aMarangoni flow, which can unexpectedly cause a long delayof the drop coalescence. The main drop bodies remain sepa-rated while connected via a thin neck through which thedrops exchange liquid. The delay of the coalescence is nowfinally understood theoretically [7]. The drop-drop coales- cence system is now used as an experimental and theoreti-cal model system to investigate the impact of surficialMarangoni flows on the hydrodynamics of thin films for dif-ferent cases, such as surface tension gradients caused bylocal evaporation (coffee stain effect) or vapour adsorption.

These new multifunction- al coatings should combine passive components of \"classical\" coatings and active components, which provide fast response of the coating properties to changes occurring either in the passive matrix of multifunctional coat-ings (e.g., cracks, local pH change) or in the local environ-ment surrounding the coating (electromagnetic irradiation).The coatings could also have several functionalities like bio-or sensor activity. The introduction of only few percents of microgel parti- cles containing a ''green'' corrosion inhibitor allows signifi-cant improvement of the corrosion protection properties of acoating [1]. The effect can be attributed to improvement of the barrier properties of the coating as well as to the actionof the corrosion inhibitor, which totally suppresses the cor -rosion process in the local area of the damage. Usage ofmicrogels is very advantageous, since they combine the prop-erties of both liquids and solids. The polymeric framework ofthe crosslinked polymeric network supplies the system withthe mechanical strength, while the corrosion inhibitor retainsits mobility and can be delivered to the metal surface whenthe coating is damaged. The synthesis of microgels is com-paratively easy and can be performed in a one pot process,which increases the potential for up-scaling. Silica armoured polystyrene composite nanocontainers were filled with 5, 10 or 20 wt-% of 8-hydroxyquinoline [2]. The aim of our work is to introduce a new type of containersbased on Pickering emulsions ( Fig. 1) as one of the controlled delivery and release tools for further application for uptakeand release of the potentially various types of active materi-als in both delivery systems and multifunctional feedbackactive coatings. The approach was employed in self-healingcoatings in order to demonstrate the application potential ofthe proposed new type of nanocontainers. Especially thedesign of multifunctional container components is crucial forthis work, since it allows for a reduction of fabrication stepsand involved reagents for their synthesis. A method to spontaneously form hybrid nano-structures consisting of ceria nanoparticles supported on a porous sili- ca colloid was reported in [3]. The structures have high sur- face area and can be used to adsorb useful molecules for future release. Spontaneous emulsification, which requiresneither template nor externally applied energy, has been shown to be a green method to generate silica nanostruc-tures that could find future use either in corrosion pre-vention or, perhaps, in other fields as easily recoverable cat-alyst support. Fig. 1: SEM micrographs of silica-8-hydroxyquinoline composite containers based on Pickering emulsions [3]. and spherical their application asnanoreservoirs for corrosion inhibition [4]. The incorporated mechanically stable nanocarriers block the micro-pores,cracks and areas with low cross-link density in the passiveSiO x/ZrO xcoating film and improve its physical barrier prop- erties. Furthermore, due to the pH-stimulated release ofinhibitor during the corrosion process well pronounced activeself-healing was provided. A polyelectrolyte coating of poly- l-histidine and poly(methacrylic acid) was prepared and shown to be effec-tive for sustained release of negatively charged speciesunder physiological conditions [5]. This complex demonstrat- ed pH-dependent release with low levels of sustainedrelease at pH = 7-8. Controlled release on the microgramscale over 25 days was shown at physiological pH, which isadvantageous and necessary for the desired in vivoeffect, i.e. signalling of osteoblasts to the implant surface. Coatingscapable of dissolution under physiological conditions arewell-suited to application on porous titanium surfacesbecause their removal from the surface exposes the porousstructure to cells, potentially allowing for greater osseointe-gration of the titanium implants. Stable microspheres loadedwith vitamin E can be obtained by vitamin emulsification inthe gum acacia solution using ultrasound treatment [6]. The obtained microcapsules were embedded into a cross-linkedCa-alginate film forming a model cutaneous drug deliverysystem. Vitamin E release kinetics from the Ca-alginate filmwith entrapped microspheres is essentially more sustained,especially in comparison with the release of free vitamin dis-tributed in the polymer film. 110 NON-PLANAR Potsdam)Since Soft Matter F., Grigoriev, Encapsulated and WaterBorne Anti Corrosive Coatings, Adv.Mater. 24, 2429-2435 (2012).Active Interfaces and Coatings Sonication as a Tool for Surface Modification The collapse of the critical cavitation microbubble in liquidsunder ultrasonic treatment results in an enormous concentra-tion of energy from the conversion of the surface energy andkinetic energy of the liquid motion into heat or chemical ener-gy. The high local temperatures (5000-7000 K inside a cavita-tion bubble) and pressures combined with rapid cooling pro-vide unique means for forming nanomaterials with non-equi-librium structure under extreme conditions [7-9]. The surface of the ultrasonically produced nanomaterials can be changedby decorating it with suitable hydrophilic and hydrophobicorganic moieties. Cavitation at the solid surface normally begins with a nucleation process, in which the defects or assembled mole-cules located at a liquid-solid interface act as nucleation cen-ters and are actively involved in the evolution of the cavita-tion bubbles. A mixture of octadecylphosphonic acid andoctadecanethiol was stamped on the Si wafer coated withdifferent thicknesses of aluminium layer (20-500 nm) [7]. The height values between hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaceswere reduced up to 3 nm in order to equilibrate the contribu-tion of both surfaces to the nucleation process. Only thehydrophobic surfaces provided the nucleation centers at theinitial stage of sonication (up to 40 min). SEM and AFMmicroscopy studies of the surface topology after sonicationproved that cavitation bubbles are far more likely to nucleateat the hydrophobic surface ( Fig. 2). Fig. 2: SEM micrographs of the patterned Al sample after 10 min of sonication Upper part is the hydrophobized part [7].Active defects (pits) formed only on the hydrophobic surfaceat the initial stage of ultrasonic treatment contribute tonucleation of cavitation bubbles during the increase of soni-cation time. High intensity ultrasonic irradiation induces theformation of an interfacial gas layer at the solid surfaceimmersed in different liquid media (water saturated with dif-ferent gases, such as argon, nitrogen or carbon dioxide) byaccelerating the adsorption of dissolved gas [8]. Subsequently, the gas rearranges in diverse nano- ormicrostructures which take further part in the cavitationprocess. The presence of argon and nitrogen in the liquidmedium accelerates the surface cavitation keeping theresponse selective on the patterned surfaces. By varying thegas adsorption time it is possible to accelerate or to slowdown heterogeneous cavitation. Likely a secondary nucle-ation mechanism takes place in this system, whereas the gascan be trapped (forming assembled molecules) into thedefects formed and initiates the following growth of newcavitation bubbles. We also observed that at longer sonica-tion times (more than 40 min), the thermal mechanism of theformation of porous metal surfaces prevails over the cavita-tion effects [9]. D. G. Shchukin, D. A.

Aims Research goals of the nano-bio-interfaces group are targeted to use the basic princi- ples of physical chemistry for designing spherical and planar interfaces for interac- tion with living cells. Such approaches are envisioned to enable investigation of funda- mental processes in cell biology: protein traffick- ing, the surface presentation of peptides, aggrega- tion state of proteins as well as design of new interfaces for patterning and re-configurable interfaces for cell cultures.Both spherical and planar interfaces and methods are usedfor investigation and advanced characterization. We are alsodesigning new Raman based sensors and amplifiers forlabel-free imaging. The group is also using principles of self-assembly for designing a next generation of carriers, multicompartmentand anisotropic carriers as well as gradient surfaces. Present Work Currently, we are continuing our work on probing polymericand lipid membrane permeability. Using the obtained knowl-edge, we are gaining insights into the structure and functionsof proteins at the surface of cells. These principles are alsoused for inducing release from red blood cells ( Fig. 1). It was found in our studies, that opto-nanoporation can be also usedfor release of molecules from red blood cells. Fig. 1: Investigation of the permeability and release of molecules from red blood cells using opto-nano poration. Raman spectroscopy has been used to confirm binding of gold nanoparticles onto lipid membrane and oligosaccharidesand proteins located on the membrane of red blood cells.Control experiments have been conducted to exclude thermaland photo-bleaching. To the best of our knowledge, this isone of the first accounts of active release from red bloodcells. Intracellular incorporation of probes is extended to in - clude label-free (Raman based) sensors. Their performance is assessed by performing label-free imaging of cells. Fig. 2: Raman micro-imaging and mapping of molecular features of SiO 2, silica (red) particles functionalized with gold nanoparticles inside living cells. Here, we are actively using Raman spectroscopy and micro - scopy for investigation of molecular features of moleculesinside living cells ( Fig. 2). Using nanoparticles and silica col- loidal probes we have designed intracellular probes for label-free imaging and observed signal amplification. It can be seen from Fig. 2that cytosol and nucleus of a cell can be also imaged based on label-free scattering. Thedesigned sensors are quite efficient, so that even applicationof light with intensity comparable to that of sun produceddetectable label-free scattering signals. We have also pursued a new approach towards con- trolled patterning by using a simple method of adsorbing goldnanoparticles at the surface of soft films. These becomestiffer thus controlling protrusion and, and therefore, mask-ing the particles which can be later on patterned with con-trolled patchiness. Using such an approach fabrication ofanisotropic multicompartment constructs is also possible.Peculiarly, using the same approach of adsorbing nanoparti-cles film stiffness is increased, improving cell adhesion onthe surface. This is particularly useful for seeding cells anddesigning active bio-interfaces. Interestingly, application of gold nanoparticles has been beneficial in connection with poly-L-lysine/hyaluronic acid(PLL/HA) films. These films are particularly attractive duetheir reservoir-like properties. However, they are also quitesoft - an undesirable property for growing cells. Applicationof gold nanoparticles has been shown to enhance mechani-cal properties of such films making them stiffer. This veryproperty has been also used in our research to design novelmeans of controlling patchiness of multicompartment cap- 112 Andre G.

Application of gold nanoparticles strengthens the films, thus enabling controlled embedding ofcapsules and leading to fabrication of capsules with con-trolled patchiness. Fig. 3: Cell-patterning by laser-nanoparticle interaction. Active bio-interfaces have been tested by controlled laser-nanoparticle induced patterning of cells ( Fig. 3). In this direc- tion remotely controlled methods were employed, and celldetachment, patterning, and regrowth were investigated.Natural continuation of this work is seen on self-assembly ofnanoparticles and polymeric films. Fig. 4: Calcium carbonate biocompatible microparticles with incorporat- ed gold nanoparticles for efficient label-free sensing. One of the directions of research concerns development of methods for enhancement of label-free Raman signals usingcolloidal and interfacial modification. Figure 4 shows calciumcarbonate porous microparticles before and after functional-ization with gold nanoparticles. Subsequently, calcium car-bonate microparticles functionalized with gold nanoparticleswere used for detection of such biomarkers as glucose. Other research areas include development of carriers for enzyme-catalyzed reactions and investigation of mechanicalproperties of polymeric capsules and films as well as theirinteraction with cells. In the former case we are developingmeans of protection of enzymes as well as using enzymes forintracellular degradation of capsules. In the latter case weare trying to understand mechanobiology and develop mechanically stable carriers based on understanding of these processes.Future GoalsUsing interfacial methods, we are planning to: \u00b7 design carriers for enzyme-catalyzed reactions in which enzymes are protected, while the substrate freely circulates for enzyme-catalyzed reactions; \u00b7 further develop reconfigurable and adjustable interfaces for controlling and patterning of cells; \u00b7 design gradient coatings and use them for investigation of capsule-surface interaction, motion, positioning; \u00b7 using interfacial approaches, investigate mechano-biology of microcapsules relevant for in-vivo delivery; \u00b7 develop novel and advanced anisotropic carriers and capsules; \u00b7 design novel Raman based sensors and amplifiers based on nanoparticle self-assembly. Use these probes for intracellu-lar imaging and sensing.

The molecular building blocks of these systems join by themselves\" and form a variety of supra-molecular assem- blies, which then interact to produce even larg- er structures and networks. The associates of the department form several research groups. At present, the research group leaders and topics are: \u00b7 Rumiana Dimova: Biophysics Lab; \u00b7 Stefan Klumpp: Regulation of Bioprocesses. The main results of these research groups are described in separate reports on the following pages. These reports areordered in a bottom-up manner, i.e., from small to largelength scales, and related to five research areas: Biopoly-mers, Motors and Filaments, Membranes and Vesicles, SoftInterfaces, and Complex Systems. Here, the results of theresearch groups will be briefly summarized and some addi-tional results will be highlighted. Biopolymers Carbohydrates and polysaccharides have been studied by theresearch group of M. Santer using molecular dynamics simu- lations. The focus was on two types of polysaccharides: GPI-anchors, which can link a variety of proteins to cell mem-branes, and lipopolysaccharides, which protect bacteriaagainst the infection by bacteriophages. The conformationalfreedom of the different glycosidic bonds between the sub-units of the polysaccharides was determined by calculatingfree energy landscapes as a function of glycosidic torsionangles: even short oligosaccharides were shown to be rela-tively flexible. Proteins that act as enzymes must first bind the reaction partners as ligands. The group of T. Weikl considered the temporal ordering of these binding processes with respect toconformational changes of the enzymes: the enzyme may undergo conformational changes before ligand binding or the ligands may first bind and then induce conformationalchanges of the enzyme. The temporal ordering has no effecton the binding equilibrium, but affects the binding kinetics and, thus, may be revealed by mutations of the protein. Molecular Motors and FilamentsIntracellular cargo is transported by teams of molecularmotors that pull on the cargo via elastic stalks. The simplestcase corresponds to cooperative transport by two identicalmotors as shown in Fig. 1. The influence of this elastic cou- pling between the motors on the transport properties hasbeen addressed in the framework of chemomechanical net-works and semistochastic models (see the report by F. Berger and C. Keller). The chemomechanical networks are relatively complex but involve only two additional parameters that canbe deduced from the cargo trajectories. The semi-stochasticmodels reveal different interference regimes, in which themotors stall each other or pull each other from the filament. Fig.1: Two molecular motors coupled to a cargo particle via their elastic stalks or linkers. The motors step forward stochastically and stretchtheir linkers, thereby inducing an elastic interaction that generates themutual strain force F. Strong elastic coupling leads to a fast buildup oflarge forces, whereas weakly coupled motors experience only relativelysmall forces. [F. Berger et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. (2012)] Another molecular motor, for which a chemo-mechanical net- work has been constructed, is myosin V that steps alongactin filaments, see Fig 2. Furthermore, stochastic tug-of- wars between two teams of molecular motors were experi-mentally confirmed for the transport of early endosomes infungi. In this case, dyneins that bind to a cargo or unbindfrom it can change the cargo's direction of motion, see Fig 3. In the context of actin filaments, we have addressed a recent controversy about the depolymerization of actin fila-ments (see the report by T. Niedermayer ). Using single fila- ment experiments, it was shown that the depolymerization ofactin filaments typically proceeds in a bi-phasic way, with aninitial fast phase interrupted by a slow phase, see Fig. 4. In contrast to previous proposals, the interruptions were shownto be caused by the local and random dimerization of actinsubunits. The theoretical analysis of the stochastic interrup-tion times and pause durations provides a general method todetermine rather small changes in the molecular interactionsbetween the subunits of actin filaments.Research in the (University of Heidelberg) 1982:PhD (Dr. rer. nat.), Physics (University of Munich) 1979-1984: Teaching Associate (University of Munich)1984-1986: Research Associate (Cornell University)1986-1988: Group leader (FZ J\u00fclich) 1987:Habilitation, Theoretical Physics (University of Munich)Thesis: Critical behavior of interfaces:Wetting, surface melting and relatedphenomena1989-1990: Associate Professorship (University of Munich)1990-1993: Full Professorship (University of Cologne), Director of the Division \"Theory II\" (FZ J\u00fclich)Since Nov 1993: Director (Max and Interfaces, Potsdam) Fig. 2: Chemomechanical network for myosin V that steps along actin filaments.

Niedermayer et al, PNAS (2012)] 117 Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis Ribosomes are rather complex molecular machines thatsynthesize proteins by translating the codon sequences ofmRNA molecules into peptide chains. In order to do so, theribosomes move along the mRNAs and translate one codonafter another by binding and processing cognate tRNA mole-cules that are charged with the correct amino acids. In order to understand this process of translational elon- gation, one has to take two important molecular features intoaccount. First, the ribosome has three binding pockets fortRNA molecules, the A-, P-, and E-sites, see Fig. 5(a). As indi- cated in this figure, these three sites are aligned along themRNA that is translated by the ribosome. Second, a tRNA canonly bind to the ribosome after it has formed a ternary com-plex with an EF-Tu protein and a GTP nucleotide, Fig. 5(b). Fig.5: (a) Schematic view of a ribosome (grey dumbbell) that translates a mRNA molecule (black strand). The ribosome has three binding pocketsfor tRNA molecules, the A-, P-, and E-sites. These three sites are aligned along the mRNA and their separations are equal to the length of a singlecodon; (b) Ternary complex formed by a tRNA molecule (small grey ball),an EF-Tu protein (large blue ball), and a GTP nucleotide (not shown). Each tRNA molecule that is processed by the ribosome first binds as a ternary complex to the A-site and is then translo-cated from the A- to the P-site. During the next elongationcycle, this tRNA is moved from the P- to the E-site, fromwhich it is finally released. A single, codon-specific cycle of translational elongation involves several ribosomal states as depicted schematicallyin Fig 6. At the beginning of the elongation cycle, the ribo- some contains two tRNA molecules in its P- and its E-site buthas an empty A-site, which is located at the codon to betranslated. In Fig. 6, this codon is colored in red. When a cog- nate tRNA molecule arrives at the ribosome by diffusion, itfirst binds loosely to the A-site but becomes fully accommo-dated into this site after its correct anticodon has been rec-ognized. During the latter substeps, the E-site tRNA and theEF-Tu molecule are released from the ribosome and a new peptide bond is formed. However, before the translating ribo-some is able to bind and process a cognate tRNA, it typicallysamples through a large thatalso bind to the ribosomal A-site and, thus, impede binding of the cognate tRNA, see upper left cartoon in Fig. 6.Fig.6: Elongation cycle of a ribosome corresponding to the translation of a single codon (red mRNA segment): Initially, the ribosome dwells at thiscodon with an empty A-site until a ternary complex arrives and occupiesthis site. This ternary complex is typically non-cognate (upper left car-toon) and is then released from the A-site without further processing. Ifa cognate ternary complex is bound (lower left cartoon), it is recognizedby its anticodon and is then fully accommodated into the A-site (lowerright cartoon). During this accommodation step, the EF-Tu molecule isreleased. After the formation of a new peptide bond (not shown), theribosome undergoes translocation and moves to the subsequent codon(green mRNA segment) in order to start the next elongation cycle. [S. Rudorf et al, to be published] We have recently developed a quantitative theory that takes both the formation of ternary complexes and the competitivebinding between cognate and non-cognate tRNAs intoaccount and allows to calculate the codon-specific elonga-tion times of the ribosome. Another interesting aspect oftranslation that we studied theoretically is the robustness ofprotein synthesis with respect to variations of individualtRNA concentrations. Membranes and Vesicles Lipid molecules in aqueous solution self-assemble into bilay-er membranes that have a thickness of about 4nm. In order todesorb from the membrane again, a single lipid has to over-come a large free energy barrier that has been determined inthe group of A. Grafm\u00fcller using atomistic molecular dynam- ics simulations. Unexpectedly, the desorption free energywas found to increase with membrane tension because ofthe conformational entropy of the lipid tails. Lipid vesicles exposed to different aqueous phases exhibit unusual morphologies and morphological transitions as discov-ered in the group of R. Dimova: wetting transitions, droplet- induced budding processes, and spontaneous tubulation, i.e.,the formation of membrane nanotubes that are stable even inthe absence of external forces. The latter process providesdirect evidence that the polymer/lipid interactions lead to aspontaneous membrane curvature that generates a largemembrane tension. In fact, one unique feature of aqueous pha-se separation in vesicles is the possibility to directly determinethe membrane tensions from the (effective) contact angles asvisible in the optical microscope, see Fig. 7, and from the inter- facial tension between the two liquid phases. 118 The interactions of nanoparticles with membranes and vesi- cles have been studied by the group of T. Weiklusing Monte Carlo methods to minimize the free energy of the mem-brane/ particle systems. These studies revealed strongly at -tractive interactions between nanoparticles adsorbed ontovesicles. As a result of these interactions, the adheringnanoparticles aggregate on the vesicle membranes and oftenform linear chains enwrapped by membrane nanotubes. Another membrane system that has been addressed is provided by double-membrane structures that play an impor-tant role in cellular processes such as autophagy, reproduc-tion, and viral infection. In these processes, one typicallystarts from double-membrane sheets that become unstableand close up into double-membrane vesicles. The stability ofa double-membrane sheet depends primarily on its lateralsize and the spontaneous membrane curvature along its rim[R. Knorr al, PLoS ONE (2012)]. Fig.7: (a) Morphology of vesicle membrane (red) enclosing two liquid droplets. The upper droplet contains the PEG-rich /H9251phase, the lower one contains the dextran-rich /H9252-phase. The interface (blue) between the droplets meets the membrane along the three-phase contact line, withthe exterior phase denoted by /H9253. The two membrane segments and the interface define three (effective) contact angles, /H9258/H9251, /H9258/H9252, and /H9258/H9253that can be directly measured by optical microscopy; (b) These contact anglesand the interfacial tension /H9018/H9251/H9252of the ( /H9251/H9252) interface determine the two membrane tensions /H9018/H9251/H9253and /H9018/H9252/H9253. Interfacial Phenomena Polymer Brushes consisting of diblock copolymers undergomicro-phase separation and provide surfaces with stable na -noscale patterns, which can be used to control the organizationof nanoparticles into larger aggregates as studied by the groupof C. Seidel. Using dissipative particle simulations, a variety of different morphologies for these aggregates has been identified as well as morphological transitions, which resemble wetting transitions of liquid droplets at chemically patterned surfaces. Morphological wetting transitions can be induced, in a rather simple way, by increasing the volume of the liquid droplets. As a consequence, these transitions also have astrong effect on surface nucleation and lead to non-isomor- phic nucleation pathways. One example for such a pathwayhas been studied in the context of edge melting of alkane monolayers ( H. Kusumaatmaja et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. Complex SystemsMost macromolecules within the living cell are continuouslysynthesized and degraded. Experimental data on mRNA degradation and translation have been analyzed in the group of A. Valleriani using stochastic modeling. In the context ofmRNA degradation, it was shown that the experimentallydetermined decay patterns for the mRNA degradation can beused to determine the age-dependent decay rates and thelife time distributions of the mRNA molecules. In the contextof translation, data on ribosomal profiling have been ana-lyzed for different growth and stress conditions. The independent research group of S. Klumpp addressed the interplay of physical constraints and functional require-ments in living systems, with a focus on molecular machinesinvolved in gene expression, genetic circuits, and cellulardynamics. Genetic circuits in bacteria are intimately coupledto cellular growth because many parameters of gene expres-sion depend on the growth rate. These dependencies havebeen studied for the replication control system of plasmids.Some bacteria can respond to magnetic fields via organellescalled magnetosomes that contain magnetic nano-particles.Robust chain formation was found to require both magneticinteractions and active transport. Another, more abstract class of complex systems that has been studied is provided by binary or 'spin' variables onscale-free networks with correlations between their vertexdegrees. In assortative and dissortative networks, the vertices are primarily connected to other high-degreeand low-degree vertices, respectively. In both cases, the net-works can be decomposed into vertex layers, which areordered at low temperatures and undergo successive phasetransitions as the temperature is increased, see Fig. 8. Fig 8: Typical configurations of binary or 'spin' variables on assortative (left) and dissortative (right) scale-free networks as a function of tem-perature T. 'Spin-up' and 'spin-down' states are shown in red and blue,respectively. Each column parallel to the y-axis shows the 'spin' states{i} of all vertices in the network. As the temperature increases, the ordered vertex layers become disordered one after another. [J. Menche et al, Phys. Rev.

Reinhard LipowskyDirector, Theory & Bio-Systems Department 119 BIOPOLYMERS Carbohydrates are known to be important for cell-cell communication or in modifying the properties of proteins and lipids in the extra- cellular matrix. Still many of the possible biological roles of these oligosaccharides, or glycans, are yet to be elucidated. In addition to the specific recognition of many small sac- charides by certain biomolecules, larger oligosac- charides have the potential to support a much broad- er, unspecific functionality, owing to their internal flexibility and overall diversity. For computational approaches comple-menting experimental studies, the latter aspects pose seriouschallenges, in particular at the atomistic level with re spect toforce field development and conformational sampling. To ex -plore the behavior of glycans in a larger context when theyare expected to fine-tune the interaction between biomole-cules, a mapping onto reduced or effective models must bedevised. In our group, we currently pursue two long term case studies in order to establish a corresponding ladder of de -scriptions. The first study deals with the class of so-calledGlycosylphosphatidylinositol(GPI)-Anchors emphasizing theinteraction with lipids (with D. Varon Silva and P .H. Seeberger , Department of Biomolecular Systems, MPIKG; Brezesinski , Department Interfaces, second carbohydrate-protein interactions(with important Anchors as Glycolipids GPIs are glycans that covalently link proteins to the outer leaf -let of cell membranes [1]. The carbohydrate part is in close proximity to both, a protein and a lipid component at the sametime, see Fig. 1. For the atomistic representation of the complete GPI, only the connection to the protein is available from force field data -bases. For the part comprising glucosamine, phosphoinsitoland the lipid (glucosamine - /H92511-6myoIno-1- phosphodistearyl- glycerol, highlighted by the red frame in Fig. 1), an adaption of the force field has been developed. For complex moleculessuch as this, there are few opportunities to validate the forcefield prediction against structural data from experiment. In a joint effort, we have investigated this molecule within Lang-muir monolayers of crystalline order [2].Fig. 1.Chemical structure of a lipidated GPI molecule with protein and carbohydrate backbone. The part indicated by the red frame has beenstudied as a separate molecule in [2]. The Nature of the GPI Anchor Backbone Apart from the established role as an anchoring device forproteins, there is only indirect evidence for many other possi-ble functions of the GPI, such as being a mediator for theassociation of the attached protein with lipid rafts. One com-plication here is the heterogeneity of the molecule, its com-position sensitively depends on the protein attached. Fordeveloping computational models, the invariant GPI back-bone is a natural and convenient starting point. But even theseemingly basic and simple question whether this backboneis a rather flexible link or maintains a characteristic structurecan only be answered comprehensively after a mapping ofthe atomistic to an adequate reduced model has been accom-plished ( Fig. 2). The different notions of the backbone -flexibil- ity vs. rigidity-, can actually be reconciled by stating that thebackbone assumes a rather rigid structure that can little bestretched, but is to some extent compressible by forces ofphysiological magnitude (starting at roughly 10pN) [3].

[2]Subgel Phase Vilotijevic, Bacteriophages Utilize the Protective Polysaccharide Coat of Gram-Negative Bacteria?Similar questions as for the GPI emerge for certain lipo poly -saccharides (LPS). Gram-negative bacteria protect themselvesagainst invaders through a dense polysaccharide coat, whichis also a target for the immune response of higher organismsinvaded by these bacteria. The coat is formed by an LPS brush,the carbohydrate part of which (the O-Antigen) consists of re -peating units (RU) of a tetrasaccharide building block ( Fig. 3) Fig. 3. (a) Schematic representation of a phage penetrating the lipopoly - saccharide coat on the membrane of gram-negative bacteria. (b) snap-shot of an MD simulation where three O-Antigens simultaneously attachto one tail spike protein. A bacteriophage must, prior to infection, overcome the poly- saccharide barrier before its DNA can be injected into thecell. It does so by recognizing a 2 RU epitode (an octasaccha-ride) with its so-called tail spike proteins (TSP), and cleavingthe O-Antigen by hydrolysis at an active site on the corre-sponding protein scaffold. Little is known about importantfurther aspects of the cleavage process e.g., whether it oc -curs continuously, is used as a means to orient the phage orto generate a force in order to push it against the membraneand initiate the DNA injection process.Fig. 4. (a) Hairpin-like extreme conformation of two repeat units of a serotype Y Shigella flexneri O-Antigen, the end-to-end distance of theoctasaccharide can become as small as 1nm, but this event is relativelyrare as shown in (b). Most of the time the molecule resided in anextended conformation as depicted above. The formation of the hairpincan be attributed to the metastable state B in the free energy landscapeof the glycosidic angles, see contour plot in (c). (d) The same conforma-tion is also observed in a reduced model similar to that in Fig. 2 (onlybackbone atoms are displayed). A first clue to these questions is given by a comprehensive simulation study of short fragments (a few RU long) of the O-Antigens, see Fig. 4. They show the formation of hairpin-like conformations that can lead to significant temporal coiling ofthe otherwise stiff polysaccharide. This suggests a rich vari-ety of carbohydrate-protein interactions, such as conforma-tional selection of the O-Antigen by the TSP. Here we have ananalogy to the interaction of a GPI anchor with a membrane.The time scales needed to characterize the problem appropri-ately, e.g., as transitions between many possible intermedi-ate states, exceed the scope of atomistic simulations, andthe mapping to reduced models is called for.

The changes be - tween different protein conformations occur during binding or unbinding of ligands, or dur- ing chemical reactions of ligands that are ca - talysed by a protein. A central question is how the conformational changes of a protein are coupled to these binding and catalytic processes. In some cases, a confor - mational change has been proposed to occur predominantlyprior to a binding process, an unbinding process, or a catalyt-ic process, which has been termed 'conformational selection'since the ligand appears to select a conformation for binding,unbinding, or catalysis. In other cases, the conformationalchange seems to occur predominantly after a binding, unbind-ing, or catalytic process. The conformational change thenappears to be 'induced' by this process. Binding via confor-mational selection implies induced-change unbinding, andvice versa, since the ordering of events is reversed in thebind ing and unbinding direction. The ordering of events hasno effect on the binding equilibrium, but affects the bindingkinetics and, thus, may be revealed by mutations that changethe kinetics [1]. Our group has suggested a general kinetic framework that can be used (i) to identify the ordering ofevents in the coupling of conformational changes, bindingand catalysis from mutational data and (ii) to determine therates of the substeps of coupled processes from a combinedanalysis of enzyme kinetics measurements and dynamic NMRexperiments that inform on the conformational exchange [2]. Mutational Analysis of Binding MechanismOur mutational analysis of the binding and unbinding kineticsfocuses on mutations distal to the binding site that mainlyaffect the conformational equilibrium of a protein. We findthat conformational-selection processes are sensitive to suchdistal mutations because these processes involve a changeto a low-populated, excited-state conformation prior to abinding, unbinding, or catalytic event, and because the equi-librium probability and excitation rate of this conformationdepend on the conformational free-energy differences. Incontrast, induced-change processes involve a conformationalrelaxation into a new ground state after a binding, unbinding,or catalytic event, which is rather insensitive to changes inconformational free-energy differences, provided (i) the con-formational relaxation is fast [1], or (ii) the transition-state for the conformational exchange is close in free energy and struc -ture to the excited protein conformation [2]. The analysis of the effect of distal mutations thus can provide the basis for asimple diagnostic to identify conformational-selection versusinduced-change processes. 122 Thomas Weikl 01.04.1970 1996:Diploma, Physics (Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin) Thesis: Interactions of rigid membrane inclusions1999: PhD, Physics (Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, Potsdam)Thesis: Adhesion California, Francisco)Since 2002: Group Leader (Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, Potsdam)2008:Habilitation, Physics (University Potsdam)Thesis: Transition states and loop-closure principles in protein foldingConformational Changes in Protein FunctionBIOPOLYMERS Fig. 2: Extended catalytic cycle of the enzyme DHFR from E. coli. The enzyme (E) catalyzes of dihydrofolate (DHF) (NH) conformations are shown in red, ground-state conformations in blue. On our extended cycle, the catalytic step is decomposed into the actual chemical substep in the closed conformation of the enzyme required for catalysis and a physical substep in which the enzyme conformation changes from closed to occluded. Our analysis of the product-unbinding kinetics and NMR relaxation experiments indicate that the conformational change from the occluded to the closed conformation occurs largely prior to the unbinding of the product THF. Along our extended cycle, the product unbinds from an excited state with a conformation similar to the closed conformation (denoted as 'closed~').123References: versus Kinetic differences and 75, 104-110 (2009).[2]Weikl, T.

DHFR from E. coli exhibitscharacteristic changes between a 'closed' and an 'occluded'conformation of the active-site loop along its catalytic cycle( Fig. 1). The change from the closed to the occluded confor- mation occurs during the catalytic step. Since the catalysedreaction can only occur in the closed conformation, we havesuggested an induced-change mechanism in which the chem-ical reaction precedes the conformational change during thecatalytic step ( Fig. 2). We have determined the rates of these two substeps from experimental data for the overall rates ofthe catalytic step and for the rates of the conformationalexchange. Our analysis of mutational data indicates that theconformational change during product unbinding follows aconformational-selection mechanism, i.e. the conformationalchange occurs predominantly prior to unbinding [2]. Fig. 1: DHFR from E. coli exhibits changes between a closed and occlud- ed conformation along its catalytic cycle. In these conformations, theMet20 loop either closes over the active site, or protrudes into it. Thedifferent conformations are stabilized by different hydrogen bonds toadjacent loops. The bound substrate and co-factor here are shown inyellow. Fig. 3: 7-state model for catalysis and inhibition of an enzyme with induced-fit binding mechanism. In this model, substrate molecules S andinhibitor molecules I first bind in conformation E 1of the enzyme. These binding events induce changes into conformation E 2in which the sub- strate S is converted into the product P . Catalysis, Inhibition and Drug Resistance of Enzymes with Induced-fit Binding MechanismWe have extended classical models of enzyme catalysis andinhibition by including a conformational change during thebinding and unbinding of substrate, product, or inhibitor mol-ecules ( Fig. 3). Our focus was on enzymes with induced- change binding mechanism since many enzymes close rathertightly over substrate or inhibitor molecules during binding.Binding via an induced-change mechanism, i.e. prior to thechange from the 'open' to the 'closed' conformation of theseenzymes, is required if the entry and exit of the ligand mole-cules is sterically obstructed in the closed conformation. Therole of the conformational changes for catalysis and inhibi-tion can be revealed by distal, non-active-site mutations thatslightly shift the conformational equilibrium, but do not inter-fere directly with binding and catalysis in the active site ofthe enzymes. Several groups have suggested that such shiftsin the conformational equilibrium might explain why non-active-site mutations can contribute to multi-drug resistance,i.e. to an increase of catalytic rates in the presence of differ-ent inhibitory drugs. Based on our extended model for en zy -mes with induced-change binding mechanism shown in Fig. 1, we have investigated how these mutations affect catalysisand inhibition [3]. Two cases can be distinguished: In case 1, the maximum catalytic rate of the enzyme is limited by theunbinding of the product. We find that the catalytic rate inthe presence of inhibitors depends exponentially on themutation-induced change /H9004/H9004G Cof the free-energy difference between the two conformations of the enzyme in this case.Non-active-site mutations with /H9004/H9004G C>0 that slightly destabi- lize the closed conformation 2 relative to the open conforma-tion 1 of the enzyme lead to an increase in the catalytic rate,irrespective of the inhibitor. Such non-active-site mutationsthus contribute to a multi-drug-resistance of the enzyme. Incase 2, the maximum catalytic rate of the enzyme is limitedby the forward rate of the catalytic step. In this case, muta-tion-induced changes of the conformational equilibrium haveno effect on the catalytic rate in the presence of inhibitors. Acomparison with experimental data for the non-active-sitemutation L90M of the HIV-1 protease indicates that thisenzyme appears to follow case 1, which implies that non-active-site mutations that slightly destabilize the closed con-formation contribute to multi-drug resistance. T. Weikl, B. Hemmateenejad, F. Paul thomas.weikl@mpikg.mpikg.mpg.de Active transport by molecular motors is ubiqui- tous in all eukaryotic cells. These motor pro- teins convert chemical energy into mechani- cal work which enables them to transport cargoes such as RNAs, protein com plexes or organelles. Such intracellular trans port is often driven cooperatively by several molecular motors, which may belong to the same or to dif- ferent motor species like kinesin, dynein or myosin. These motors step stochastically along filaments, from which they unbind after a finite run length. Understanding how thesemotors interact and how their movements are coordinatedand regulated is a central and challenging problem of cellulartransport [1]. To establish a general theoretical framework for elucidating and analysing such transport processes, we re -cently introduced two complementary approaches: (i) a detail -ed enzymatic chemo-mechanical description that starts fromthe nucleotide states of the single motors [2]and (ii) a coarse- grained description considering the single motor as a stochas-tic stepper [3,4]. Such theoretical approaches integrate the well-established properties of individual motors into a predic-tive theory for cooperative transport. Network Representation of Motor Pairs Cargo transport by two coupled molecular motors is studiedusing a chemomechanical network for the complete transportsystem and analyzing the trajectories generated by this net-work. The theoretical description starts from the differentnucleotide states of a single motor supplemented by chemi-cal and mechanical transitions between these states. As aninstructive example, we focus on kinesin-1, for which adetailed chemomechanical network has been developed pre-viously [5]. The motor pair system considered here consists of two kinesin motors, a leading and a trailing motor, which areattached to the same cargo and walk on the same filament.Each motor can unbind from and rebind to the filament indi-vidually. As a consequence, the cargo is actively pulled byeither one or two motors. A mechanical step of one of themotors during a 2-motor run leads to an elastic interactionforce between the two motors described by the extension ofa linear spring. The state space of the elastically coupledmotor pair is characterized by three variables, the chemicalstates i leand itrof the leading and trailing motor and of the extension /H9004L of the motor-motor separation [2]. The resulting network has a layer structure as shown in Fig. 1, where each layer corresponds to a constant value of /H9004L. Any 1-motor run occurs on one of the boundary lines of the network and maybe terminated either by unbinding of the active motor whichleads to the unbound motor pair state, or by the rebinding ofthe inactive motor and a subsequent 2-motor run. Mechani-cal steps during 2-motor runs lead to transitions betweenneighbouring /H9004L-layers. Even though this motor pair network has a complex structure, it involves, apart from the singlemotor parameters, only two additional parameters, the cou-pling parameter K and the single motor rebinding rate si. Fig. 1: State space of a motor pair described by the individual motor states i leand i trand the extension /H9004L of the motor-motor separation. (left) Detailed description of the layer with /H9004L=0 and (right) stack of five /H9004L-layers. Activity States and Motor Pair Parameters In stochastic simulations, we studied the trajectories gener-ated from the chemomechanical network of the motor pair asa function of the single motor rebinding rate siand the elas- tic coupling parameter K [2]. In experimental studies, the val- ues of these two parameters are usually not known but haveto be determined in a consistent manner. Our theory showsthat one can determine these two parameters by measuringthe average run times during 1- and 2-motor runs of cargotrajectories. Alternatively, individual motor trajectories andthe properties of the /H9004L-distribution can be used to deduce the two unknown parameters. Which activity state is domi-nant during a motor pair walk also depends on these twoparameters. The corresponding activity diagram in Fig. 2 shows the crossover line which separates the parameterregime, in which 1-motor runs dominate the cargo run, fromthe regime, in which 2-motor runs are more likely. From indi-vidual motor trajectories, one can deduce the distribution ofthe extension /H9004L of the motor-motor separation during 2- motor runs as shown in Fig. 2. Within the studied range for the coupling parameter, the number of accessible /H9004L values varies by one order of magnitude. The maximal values of /H9004L observed in the simulations determines the size of the net-work in Fig. 1. 124 Florian Berger 06.11.1981 2008:Diploma, Physics, (University of Stuttgart) Thesis: Optimization in Driven Physics, (MPI of Colloids of Colloids and Interfaces, Potsdam)Cargo Transport by Teams of Molecular Motors: Elastic Coupling and Interference RegimesMOLECULAR MOTORS AND FILAMENTS References: [1]Berger, F., Keller, C., M\u00fcller, M.

Distinct Transport Regimes for Elastically Coupled MotorsThe case of cargo transport by two identical motors involvesan elastic coupling between the motors that can reduce themotors' velocity and/or the binding time to the filament. Weshow that this elastic coupling leads, in general, to four dis-tinct transport regimes characterized by the motor pair'saverage velocity v 2and its average binding time t 2, during which the two motors remain simultaneously bound to the fil-ament [3]. Both quantities depend on the single motor dynam- ics and on the strength K of their elastic coupling. Thus,strongly coupled and/or fast motors can quickly build up alarge strain force that pulls one of the motors from the fila-ment, while weakly coupled and/or slow motors may unbindspontaneously before reaching such a large force. The motorpair dynamics are governed by the interplay of three differentforces: the stall force F s, which corresponds to the maximal force that a single motor can generate, the detachment forceF d, which is the typical force that one motor can sustain for an extended period of time, and the scale F Kfor the elastic strain forces between the two motors. Using a continuous-time Markov process to describe the single motors as stochastic steppers, we calculate the aver-age binding time t 2and the velocity v 2for two active motors and identify four different transport regimes, see Fig. 3. We estimate the crossover lines between these regimes fromtime scale arguments for the strain force generation which,in addition, allows us to obtain an intuitive understanding ofthe mutual motor-motor interference.We apply our framework to predict the behavior of differentpairs of molecular motors based on typical parameters fromsingle motor experiments. In addition to a weak couplingregime, kinesin and dynein motors are found to exhibit astrong coupling and an enhanced unbinding regime, whereasmyosin motors are predicted to attain a reduced velocityregime. All of these regimes can be explored experimentallyby varying the elastic coupling parameter K. Our theory isconsistent with the available experimental data for a kinesin-1and myosin V. Fig. 3: (left) Average binding time and (right) velocity of a cargo pulled by two active motors in units of the single motor binding time and singlemotor velocity, respectively. Both quantities are displayed in a coloredcontour plot as functions of the rescaled single motor stall force f s=F s/FK and the rescaled detachment force f d=F d/FK, where the force scale FK=K/2l is the elastic strain force between the motors per motor step with step size l. The solid blue line separates the region with and with-out a reduced velocity, whereas the solid black line separates the regionof spontaneous and force-induced unbinding. These lines define fourdistinct transport regimes: (I) weak coupling with essentially unchangedvelocity and binding time; (II) strong coupling with both reduced bindingtime and reduced velocity; (III) reduced velocity with no effect on thebinding time and (IV) enhanced unbinding with no effect on the velocity. F. Berger, C. Keller, S. Klumpp, R. Lipowsky florian.berger@mpikg.mpg.de. corina.keller@mpikg.mpg.de 125 Actin is one of the most abundant and highly conserved proteins in eukaryotic cells. The globular protein assembles into long fila- ments, which form a variety of different net- works within the cytoskeleton. The dynamic reorganization of these networks - which is pi votal for cell motility, cell adhesion, and cell division - is based on cycles of polymerization (assembly) and depolymerization (disassembly) of actin filaments. Actin binds adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the actin-bound ATP is hydrolyzed intoadenosine diphosphate (ADP) on a time scale of a few minutes. Because ADP-actin dissociates faster from the filament ends than ATP-actin, it was thought that the filament becomesless stable as it grows older. However, recent depolymeriza-tion experiments with single filaments suggested the oppo-site behavior. Abrupt dynamic changes during filament de -polymerization have been observed in buffers containing nofree monomers, and indicate that the actin filaments becomeincreasingly stable with time. Several mechanisms for this sta - bilization have been proposed. The most prominent hypo -thesis correlates the stabilization with structural transitionsof the whole filament helix [1]. Fig. 1: Length of four actin filaments as a function of time. The filaments depolymerize in buffers containing no free monomers. The shrinkage issuddenly interrupted at a certain interruption time , which differs fromfilament to filament and represents a stochastic variable. Interruptions of Depolymerization In order to study the interruptions of depolymerization, wecollaborated with the experimental lab of Marie-France Carlier in Gif-sur-Yvette (France). A combination of single filamentmicroscopy and stochastic modeling allowed us to discoverthe surprising mechanism of filament stabilization [2,3]. In de - polymerization experiments on filaments having one end blocked, we confirmed that filaments abruptly cease toshrink and determined the time from the initiation of depoly-merization until the occurrence of the first interruption, see Fig. 1. This duration time /H9270differs from filament to filament and represents a stochastic variable. We considered various hypothetical mechanisms that may cause the observed interruptions. These mechanismscannot be observed directly, but they lead to distinct distribu-tions of the duration /H9270and these distributions can be com- pared with those obtained from single filament experiments.By modeling the underlying stochastic processes - such asthe association and dissociation of filament subunits andputative transformations of these subunits - computedthe cumulative distribution functions P(t) = prob ( /H9270 t) of the stochastic variable /H9270for all transformation mechanisms in question. For global filament transformations, which wereimplicitly considered in [1], or transitions that only occur at the depolymerizing filament end, the duration /H9270is exponen- tially distributed. Furthermore, many other mechanisms - forinstance the copolymerization of actin with already trans-formed subunits - give rise to an approximately exponentialdistribution of /H9270. Successive transformations of subunits starting from a single seed cause the duration /H9270to have a very narrow Gaussian distribution, and thus result in a sharprise of P(t) at t = < /H9270>. For the experimentally relevant range of parameters, local transformations of random subunits withinthe filament lead to a cumulative distribution that is welldescribed by the expression P(t) = 1 - exp( - /H9251/H9275t 2), (1) where the parameter /H9251is fixed by both the polymerization and depolymerization velocities, and the free parameter /H9275is the rate of the putative subunit transformations. A compari-son of our analytical expressions with the measured distribu-tion, see Fig. 2, revealed that the sudden truncation of the shrinkage process does neither arise from blocking of theends nor from a collective transition of the whole filament.Instead, we have predicted a novel, local transition processoccurring at random sites within the filament. The combination of additional single filament experi- ments with our theoretical approach - and in particular witha generalization of the distribution in equation (1) - con-firmed the notion of a local transition mechanism and identi-fied the postulated transition as the photo-induced formationof fluorescently labeled filament subunits mayexhibit a transition and that unlabeled actin filaments do notexhibit pauses. This implies that, in vivo, older filaments become de stabilized by ATP hydrolysis, in contrast to theview expressed in [1].

PLoS Biology 9, e1001161 (2011).Fig. 2: The cumulative distribution = prob ( /H9270 t) of the duration /H9270, i.e., the probability that the interruption occurs at any time prior to timet, provides a fingerprint of the mechanism that causes the interruption.The exponential distribution (shown in red) is implied by many possiblemechanisms such a transformations that may occur only at the shrinkingfilament end. The step-like function (shown in blue) is caused bysequential transformations of the filament subunits. Local transforma-tions of random subunits lead to a cumulative distribution given byequation (1) and displayed in green. Experimental data are shown inblack. The red, blue, and green curves corresponding to theoretical dis-tributions were obtained by least-square-fitting of the respective distri-butions to the experimental distribution. Each fitting procedure involvesonly one fit parameter provided by the transition rate /H9275. Since the data can only be described by the green curve, we conclude that the interrup-tions arise from local transitions of random subunits within the filament.As soon as such a transformed subunit arrives at the shrinking end, itcauses the interruption of depolymerization. Mechanism of ATP Hydrolysis The filament destabilization by ATP hydrolysis becomesapparent as an acceleration of the depolymerization prior tothe interruption: In Fig. 1, the black data, corresponding to a filament grown from ATP-actin, exhibit an increase of thedepolymerization velocity, whereas the red, green and bluedata points, obtained for three filaments grown from ADP-actin, exhibit shrinkage with constant velocity. The mecha-nism of ATP hydrolysis has remained elusive for many years:Both the so called \"random model\", where ATP is hydrolyzedat each subunit with the same rate, as well as the \"vectorialmodel\", where ATP hydrolysis exclusively takes place at asubunit neighboring an ADP-actin subunit, have been pro- posed in the literature. The measurement of the time-dependent depolymerization velocity using fluorescence microscopy in conjunction with a theoretical description ofthe depolymerization process and a careful data analysisreveals that the rate of ATP hydrolysis is constant within thefilament, corresponding to a random hydrolysis mechanism [3,4]. This method also provided novel insight into the func- tion of profilin, a protein that accelerates actin depolymeriza-tion in cells, thus demonstrating the method's potential in thefunctional analysis of actin regulators. Fig. 3: The time-dependent extension of an actin filament is shown in light gray. Left of length axis: During polymerization, ATP-actin is incor-porated into the filament. The subsequent hydrolysis of the bound ATPgives rise to ADP-actin. Right of length axis: The velocity of depolymer-ization increases over time, since ADP-actin dissociates more rapidlyfrom the filament end than ATP-actin. The local composition of the fila-ment (i.e. the fraction of ATP-actin) can be inferred from the time-dependence of the depolymerization velocity and is indicated by thecoloring of the small clocks. These clocks measure the `age' of the sub-unit at the respective position within the filament, that is the time thathas elapsed since the incorporation of the respective filament segment.The correspondence between the color of the clocks and the local timeindicates that the rate of ATP hydrolysis is constant along filament. Thomas Niedermayer , Reinhard Lipowsky thomas.niedermayer@mpikg.mpg.de 128Lipid bilayers belong to the most important structural elements of biological cells. For biological function, a flexible and dynamic internal structure and membrane composi- tion is required. Thus, despite their great inherent stability, the lipid membranes con- stantly undergo remodeling processes, involv- ing membrane fusion, pore formation and various means of lipid exchange between membranes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and energet- ics that govern such remodeling processes presents a great challenge for both experiments and molecular modeling. Thischallenge arises from the disparate length and time scalesinvolved. Bilayer membranes have lateral sizes of 100 nm toover 100 \u00b5m, yet are only a few nanometers in thickness. Theprocesses of interest take place or are initiated at the scaleof one or at most a couple of lipids molecules, i.e. a fewnanometers. At the same time, they take place on timescales too fast for high resolution experiments, yet are non-equilibrium processes, and out of reach for most molecularsimulations. Strategies to overcome these difficulties involve either the use of simplified coarse-grained models, with fewerdegrees of freedom as used in [1-3]to study membrane fusion, or enhanced sampling methods, such as umbrellasampling, which forces the system out of equilibrium, along achosen reaction coordinate. Here we describe the applicationof the latter strategy to two membrane related processes. Energetics of Nano-Pore Formation Pore formation plays an important role in many cellularprocesses that require membrane remodeling, as well as forbiomedical applications. Theories of pore formation are often based on classical nucleation theory as a balance between the edge energy andthe membrane tension /H9018. When the pore radius is close to the molecular scale however, this continuum description isunlikely to hold, because the creation and closure of thehydrophobic pore requires considerable rearrangement of thelipid molecules at the pore edge. Simulation studies of pore formation are limited to small length and time scales, and thus require artificially largemembrane tensions. Alternatively, the free energy requiredto create a nm sized hydrophilic pore can be calculated withumbrella sampling. Here, the chosen reaction coordinate wasthe distance z of a certain lipid head group from the bilayer's center of mass. Fig.1: Scheme for calculating the free energy of pore formation as a function of membrane tension in simulated lipid bilayers. When the headgroup is close to the center of the bilayer a pore forms spontaneously and the corresponding potential ofmean force (PMF) can be calculated. This method is howevercomputationally expensive and limited to individual values ofmembrane tension. A scheme to estimate the pore formationfree energy as a function of tension /H9018is outlined in Fig. 1. In this scheme the process of creating a pore in a bilayer at agiven /H9018is devided into three steps: 1) reducing the bilayer tension from /H9018to zero, 2) creating a nano-pore and 3) stretch- ing the bilayer containing a pore back to /H9018. Using this scheme, the free energy of pore formation has been calculated as a function of /H9018. The validity of the results can be tested by comparing the results to a second PMF cal-culation at a high lateral pressure of -40 bar, which finds thepore formation free energy to be 61.7\u00b13 kJ mol -1. In compari- son, the integration scheme leads to a value of 64\u00b14 kJ mol-1, demonstrating, that this method gives reliable results, over alarge range of membrane tensions. The results can be used to estimate the probability of finding a nanopore in a membrane as a function of membranetension and size. The tensions for which this probabilityreaches finite values of ~10% correlate well with the order ofmagnitude of rupture tensions observed for simulated mem-brane patches and typical vesicle sizes, despite the differenttimescales. A fit of the pore free energy as a function of /H9018for the line tension gives a value of 7.2 pN, which is close toexperimental estimates ranging from 8 to 21 pN [4]. As the restrained lipid influences the pathway of pore formation, it is not a priori clear that unrestrained conditionslead to the same intermediate transition states for pore for-mation. It is not possible to observe the formation ofnanopores in unrestrained simulations, but simulations ofnanopore closing can give insights to the intermediate con- Andrea Grafm\u00fcller 18.08.1980 2000-2004: Master in Science (MSci), Physics (1st Class Honours), Queen Mary University of London.

The two, very similar closing pathways are shown in Fig. 2. The first proceeds via a half-pore, spanning one of the monolayers only and is the same as the oneobserved in the pore formation pathway of the restrainedsimulations. In the second case, instead of a half-pore in onemonolayer, two smaller hydrophilic indentations are A full hydrophobic pore spanning theentire bilayer is never seen.

Lipid Exchange and Local Geometry Similar PMF calculations, restraining the lipid head-group ata range of distances outside the bilayer membrane can beused to estimate the desorption free energy [5]. For a tension-free membrane the desorption free energy is found to be 63\u00b12 kJ mol-1. Using the same protocol to determine the free energy change upon desorption of a lipidfrom a tense bilayer with a lateral pressure of -40 bar, wefind a desorption free energy of 80\u00b12 kJ kJ desorption from the relaxed bilayer. Tounderstand this difference, the different contributions to thefree energy change have to be considered. The major contri-bution will be the energy cost of exposing the hydrophobictails to the water. However, when the lipid is pulled into solu-tion, its tails, which are extended within a conical region inthe bilayer, become disordered with random their conformational entropy. This repre- sents a favorable contribution to lipid desorption and partial-ly compensates the hydrophobic interactions. In the tensebilayer, the lipids are more disordered and therefore gain lessentropy in solution. To investigate this effect of the localstructure further, the free energy of desorption of a lipid froma spherical micelle has also been calculated. Due to the high local curvature the lipid tails in the micelle are even moredisordered than in the tense bilayer. As expected, the desorp-tion free energy for the micelle is also higher than the ten-sion-free bilayer, with 73\u00b11.3 kJ mol -1. Fig.3: Three different aggregates, for which the desorption free energy has been calculated (a-c). (d) The conformational space of individuallipids within the three aggregates and in solution. For a more quantitative assessment, the average conforma- tional entropy of lipid tails in the different aggregates hasbeen estimated with the quasi-harmonic (QH) approximation.The results are summarized in Table 1. In the tense mem-brane, the change in conformational entropy of 14\u00b15 kJ mol -1 provides a quantitative explanation for the difference in des-orption free energy. The difference in conformational entropyin the spherical on the other hand, with 55\u00b15 kJ mol -1 is significantly larger than that in the desorption free ener-gies, which only differ by ~10 kJ mol -1. Therefore, the large lipid entropy change is to a large part compensated by otherfree energy contributions. This result is consistent with theobservation, that the number of tail-water contacts for alipid chain in the micelle is approximately 5 times as high asin the membrane aggregates, leading to a reduced contribu-tion of water-chain interactions. What has become clear from studying these three sys- tems is that the local structure has a strong influence on thefree energy of lipids in the aggregates.

The weight fraction of proteins, RNAs and polysaccha- rides is on the order of 20-30 %. Interac- tions between macromolecules in water can lead to the formation of coexisting aqueous phases. Thus, in the concentrated interior of the cell, local phase separation may occur, involving microcompartmentation, which in turn can affect, e.g., cell functioning and the performance of cytoplasmic proteins. The phenomenon of phase separation is often observed in solutions of two polymer species. The most well studied aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) formed by macromole-cules is the one of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and dextran.We studied the phase separation of this system in the closedcompartment of lipid vesicles as a model for biological micro-compartmentation. Giant lipid vesicles loaded with polymersolutions typically contain two droplets with different poly-mer compositions, formed by phase separation within thevesicle interior [1]. We employed these cell-sized biomimetic systems to study the wetting behavior of the polymer phaseson the membrane [2, 3], the reorganization of the lipid bilayer arising from molecular crowding [4]and the resulting mor- phological adopted by vesicles Two-Phase Polymer Solutions of Dextran and PEGAbove a total polymer weight fraction of a few weight per-cent, aqueous solutions of PEG and dextran demix. region is bounded by the binodal linewithin the phase diagram of the system ( Fig. 1). At concentra- tions below the binodal the polymer solution is homoge-neous. Above the binodal, the solution undergoes phase sep-aration and the compositions of the coexisting phases aregiven by the tie lines in the phase diagram. A variety of meth-ods for tie-line determination has been explored in the litera-ture based on the use of different experimental techniques.Recently, we proposed a relatively simple approach based ondensity measurements of the phases [6]. Fig. 1: Binodal and tie lines of the aqueous solution of dextran (molecular weight 400-500 kg/mol) and PEG (molecular weight 8 kg/mol) measured at 24 \u00b0C [6]. Below the binodal the polymer solution is homogeneous; above the binodal it undergoes phase separation. The insets schematically illustra - te t he vesicle membrane (red) enclosing the homogeneous solution (blue) or the two liquid droplets consisting of dextran-rich (green) and PEG-rich (yellow) phases.Membrane Wetting and Wetting at interfaces may exhibit zero or nonzero con-tact angles corresponding to complete or partial wetting,respectively. As one varies the liquid composition, the systemmay undergo a transition from complete to partial wetting.Such a transition can also occur for an aqueous solutionenclosed within a vesicle [2]. In this case, the substrate is the lipid membrane. Fig. 2: Phase separation inside a vesicle (confocal vertical cross- sections). The membrane is labelled in red; a small fraction of dextran islabelled in green. As the external osmolarity is increased in a stepwisemanner, phase separation occurs (a, b) and the dextran-rich drop (green)undergoes a wetting transition (b, c). We used giant vesicles encapsulating PEG-dextran solutions in the one-phase state ( Fig. 2a). In order to obtain vesicles containing two phases, we raise the interior polymer concen-tration above the binodal by exposing the vesicles to a hyper-tonic medium, i.e., by osmotic deflation. The polymer concen-tration inside increases, leading to phase separation ( Fig. 2a, b). The dextran-rich phase is heavier and thus, the dextran- rich droplet is always located at the bottom of the vesicle.When the external osmolarity is further increased, the dex-tran-rich phase starts to wet the membrane ( Fig. 2c). The mor- phology change of the dextran-rich droplet indicates a wet-ting from complete wetting of the PEG-rich phasein Fig. 2bto partial wetting in Fig. 2c. Wetting-Induced BuddingWhen both phases wet the membrane, the smaller one maybud out of the vesicle upon further deflation ( Fig. 3a-c). Initial- ly, for weak deflation, the vesicle is approximately spherical( Figs. 2c and 3b ). Upon further deflation, the dextran-rich phase starts to form a bud away from the PEG-rich phase ( Fig. 3c). The excess area arising from deflation is utilized by the vesicle to undergo morphological changes and a buddingtransition [5]. The direction of budding can be reversed if the phase separation occurs in the vesicle exterior [5]. In mechanical equilibrium, the two membrane tensions^/H9018peand ^/H9018demust be balanced along the contact line (where the external medium, the PEG-rich phase and the dextran-richphase are in close proximity) by the interfacial tension /H9018 pd between the two liquid phases ( Fig. 3d).

When /H9018pdis small, the membrane tensions can easily bal- ance this pulling force in the normal direction and the contactangle /H9258 eremains close to 180 degrees. As the interfacial ten- sion /H9018pdincreases and the vesicle is deflated further, the membrane tension can no longer sustain the quasi-sphericalvesicle shape, the membrane bends along the contact lineand the dextran-rich phase buds out.

Fig. 3: (a-c) Side-view phase contrast images of a budding vesicle. After phase separation (a, b), the interior solution consists of PEG-rich (lighter)and dextran-rich (heavier) droplets. Further deflation of the vesicle caus-es the dextran-rich droplet to bud out as shown in (c). In the sketch in(d), the three effective contact angles as observed with opticalmicroscopy are indicated as well as the two membrane tensions and theinterfacial tension /H9018pd. The intrinsic contact angle /H9258in, which character- izes the wetting properties of the membrane by the PEG-rich phase atthe nanometer scale is sketched in (e). The kink in the vesicle membrane shown in Fig. 3c, d is ob - served by optical microscopy but cannot persist to small length scales, since such a kink would imply an infinite bend-ing energy of the membrane. Therefore, when viewed withsub optical resolution, the membrane must be smoothly curvedas in Fig. 3e, which implies the existence of an intrinsic con- tact angle /H9258in. In contrast to the three contact angles shown in Fig. 3d, the intrinsic contact angle represents a material pa - rameter that is independent of the vesicle geometry [3]. Formation of Membrane NanotubesUpon vesicle deflation, excess area is created. Depending onthe membrane tension and spontaneous curvature, the areacreated during deflation may lead to vesicle budding asshown above, and/or may be involved in creating membranenanotubes [4], which have a diameter below optical resolu- tion and become visible when fluorescently labelled ( Fig. 4). The tubes form during the phase separation process and arestable after this process has been completed. They arealways in contact with the PEG-rich phase and adsorb onto the two-phase interface forming a layer or meshwork oftubes ( Fig. 4b). When the interface becomes overcrowded, hundreds of tubes protrude into the PEG-rich phase ( Fig. 4c).Fig. 4: Tube formation in vesicles with internal phase separation. (a) Ver- tical xz-section showing adsorption of tubes onto the two-phase inter-face (b) Horizontal xy-section at the z-position of the arrow-head in (a) showing tubes at the two-phase interface. (c) Vertical xz-sec -tion of a vesicle with overcrowded two-phase interface; the tubes pro-trude into the upper PEG-rich phase. The scale bars correspond to 15 \u00b5m. A theoretical analysis of the deflated vesicles reveals that these membrane tubes are stabilized by negative sponta-neous curvature [4, 7]. Using the large separation of length scales between the tube diameter and the overall size of thevesicles, the spontaneous curvature can be calculated and isfound to be about -1/(240 nm) for a certain range of polymerconcentrations. The nanotubes can also be retracted backinto the mother vesicle by increasing the membrane tensionvia micropipette aspiration of the vesicle. R.

They consist of a large variety of different lipids and proteins, and are highly flexible and fluid, which allows drastic changes in membrane shape and cur- vature. The interplay of molecular composition and curvature of the membranes is crucial for their biological function. Our group investigates this interplay during the encapsulation of nanoparticles [1], in the formation of membrane domains [2], and upon membrane adhesion [3]. Cooperative Wrapping of Nanoparticles Recent advances in nanotechnology have led to an increasinginterest in how nanoparticles interact with biological matter.While biomedically designed nanoparticles are promisingcarriers for drug delivery, the wide application of industrialnanoparticles has also led to concerns about their safety. Toenter the cells or cell organelles of living organisms, nano -particles have to cross biomembranes. The membranes de -form and wrap around nanoparticles if the adhesive interac-tion between the nanoparticles and membranes is sufficientlystrong to compensate for the cost of membrane bending.While the wrapping of single nanoparticles by membran es hasbeen studied intensively in theory and simulations, relativelylittle is known about the organization and elastic, membrane-mediated interactions of multiple nano particles adsorbed onmembranes. These interactions arise because the elastic de -formations of membranes depend on the distance betweenthe adsorbed particles. Our group has recently found strongly attractive elastic interactions between spherical nanoparticles adsorbed onvesicles [1]. These attractive interactions lead to bound sta - tes of the particles with a morphology that depends on theratio of the area and volume of the vesicles, which is typicallycharacterized by the reduced volume v 1. The maximal value v = 1 of the reduced volume corresponds to the area to volumeratio of a sphere. For large values of v, nanoparticles are onlypartially wrapped by the vesicle since the area to volumeratio does not allow full wrapping. For such values of v, wehave found bound states in which two particles are equallywrapped by the vesicle ( Fig. 1a). For smaller values of v, we have found strongly bound states in which two or more parti-cles are cooperatively wrapped by a membrane tube thatprotru des into the vesicle ( Fig. 1b and c ). This tubular confine- ment of several nanoparticles constitutes a novel route to en -capsulate nanoparticles reversibly in vesicle membranes. Inexperiments, the amount of confined nanoparticles as well astheir release may be controlled by changes in the osmoticconditions, which lead to changes in the reduced volume ofthe vesicles. The wrapping and membrane-mediated interactions of the nanoparticles arise from the interplay of membrane bend-ing and adhesion. The total energy is the sum of the bendingenergy of the vesicle and the overall adhesion energy of theparticles. We have determined the minimum total energy of thevesicle and particles with simulated annealing Monte Carlosimulations of triangulated vesicles in contact with particles.In Fig. 2, the minimal total energy E of a vesicle with two ad sor - bed particles is displayed as a function of the particle dis-tance r. At the reduced volume v = 0.96, the total energy E(r)exhibits local minima at the contact distance r = 2R pof the particles and at a distance r between 6R pand 9R p, separated by an energy barrier. The local minimum of E at the contactdistance r = 2R pcorresponds to the bound state of the par - ticles shown in Fig. 1ain which both particles are symmetrical- ly wrapped by the vesicle membrane. At v = 0.92 and 0.94, wefind additional branches of low-energy conformations withnegative values of E at distances r < 3 R pof the particles. In these low-energy conformations, the particles are jointly butasymmetrically wrapped by a membrane tube that invaginatesinto the vesicles ( Fig. 1band snapshot at bottom left of Fig. 2). In these conformations, the wrapping of the particles is asym-metric since the particle at the tip of the invagination is morestrongly wrapped. Besides these low-energy conformations,we have found branches of higher-energy conformations withpositive values of E in which the particles are symmetricallywrapped as in Fig. 1a.

Vesicles with Multiple Lipid Domains Multicomponent lipid vesicles with coexisting liquid-orderedand liquid-disordered domains are widely used as model systemfor the lipid bilayers of cells. The liquid-ordered domainshave a significantly higher bending rigidity than the liquid-disordered domains. Our group has investigated the coupling ofcurvature and composition of vesicles that contain such do -mains [2]. We have modeled these vesicles as triangulated surfaces, and have determined their equilibrium morphologieswith Monte Carlo simulations. The total energy of the ve sicles isthe sum of the overall bending energy of the vesicle and theline energy of the domains. We have found that the interplaybetween the bending energies of the domains and the line ener -gy of the domain boundaries can lead to multi-domain mor-phologies in which the flexible liquid-disordered domains arelocated in more strongly curved sections of the vesicles ( Fig. 3).Fig. 3: Stable liquid-ordered (grey) and liquid-disordered domains (red). In these mor-phologies, the more flexible liquid-disordered domains are located atmore strongly curved 'edges' of the vesicle. Protein Domains in Cell Adhesion Zones Submicron scale domains of membrane-anchored receptorproteins play an important role in cell signaling. Centralquestions concern the stability of these microdomains, andthe mechanisms leading to the domain formation. In immune-cell adhesion zones, microdomains of short receptor-ligandcomplexes form next to domains of significantly longer recep-tor-ligand complexes. The length mismatch between the re -ceptor-ligand complexes leads to membrane deformations andhas been suggested as a possible cause of the domain forma-tion. The domain formation is a nucleation and growth processthat depends on the line tension and free ener gy of thedomains. Our group has derived general expressions for theline tension between domains of long and short receptor-lig-and complexes and for the adhesion free energy of thedomains with a combination of analytical calculations andMonte Carlo simulations [3]. We have found that the length mismatch of receptor-ligand complexes alone is sufficient todrive the domain formation, and have obtained submicron-scale minimum sizes for stable domains that are consistentwith the domain sizes observed during immune-cell adhesion.

Brushes consisting of incompatible components are of special interest because they exhibit phase separation on nanometer scales. Lateral segregation can lead to stable surface nano-patterns that can be used to control the organization of nano-particles (NP) into larger aggregates. To study both the morphology of diblock copolymer brushes (DCB) and the organization we usedissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation [1, 2]. In our model, there are five different types of DPD beads: polymer Aand B blocks (A, B), solvent (S), nanoparticles (P), and wall(W). The interaction strength between these beads is set bythe DPD parameters a ij. Polymer chains are anchored via the ends of soluble A blocks while the solvent is poor for Bblocks. Under such conditions, A blocks form stretched brush-es whereas insoluble B blocks exhibit different morpholo-gies, which depend both on solvent quality and chain compo-sition B= NB/ (NA+ NB), where NA,Bare the lengths of A and B blocks, respectively. We performed an extensive simulation study of the mor- phology diagram of such polymer brushes, where the ABimmiscibility and solvent selectivity are treated independent-ly and on an equal footing [1]. Such an approach, which is a natural extension of the standard model of DCBs, seems tobe necessary to obtain results that are consistent with exper-imental data of, e.g., polystyrene-polymethylmethacrylatebrushes. Morphological Changes Caused by B-like Nano-particlesB-like nano-particles (e.g., core particles covered by a poly-mer B shell) exhibit high affinity to polymer B domains. Atlow NP load, particles follow the various brush pattern andform ordered spherical aggregates or extended chainsdepending on both polymer composition f Band NP concentra- tion /H9272. With increasing the microphase-separated DCB resulting in a shifttowards structures appearing in pure DCBs only at larger f B values (Fig. 1). Such a behavior is very similar to that previ- ously obtained for diblock copolymer melts. Spreading of Nano-droplets along Polymer Stripes Considering B-unlike nano-particles we observe a strong ten- dency that NPs aggregate into a single, large droplet, which is mostly located on the top of a B domain. Hexagonally ordered many-droplet morphologies are only obtained for rel- atively weak incompatibility between nano-particles andpolymer B. On the other hand, we demonstrated that spread- ing along B stripes can be realized if (i) the surface tension at the droplet-solvent interface is reduced and (ii) the contrast between polymer B affinities of NPs and solvent is sufficient-ly strong ( Fig. 2) [2]. The observation of two different spread- ing regimes, i.e., complete spreading of NPs along B stripesor localization into one large droplet, agrees qualitativelyquite well with theoretical predictions about wetting mor-phologies on substrates with striped surface domains [3]. Furthermore, our study suggests a new mechanism to move nano-objects on the surface of diblock copolymerbrushes. A slight change of the NP's solvophobicity can alterthe equilibrium position of the droplet from the top of a Bdomain ( Fig. 2B, g ) to the valley between two neighboring domains ( Fig. 2B, h ). Performing additional simulations we have shown that the particular process is reversible. The newmechanism relies only on a switching of the solvophobicity ofnano-particles, which, in principle, can be realized by cover-ing them with appropriate pH-sensitive ligands.Christian Seidel 07.02.1949 1972:Diploma, Physics (Technical University Dresden) Thesis: Calculation of angular distribution and polarization of nucleonscattering close to resonance energies 1978:Dr. rer. nat., Polymer Physics (Institute for Polymer Chemistry, Teltow) Thesis: On the calculation of the phonon dispersion of polymers, application to polyvinyliden fluoride1979-83: Research Scientist (Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute, Leningrad)1983-89: Research Scientist (Institute for Polymer Chemistry, Teltow)1985:Dr. sc. nat., Solid State Theory (Institute for Polymer Chemistry, Teltow)Thesis: Ground states and critical temperatures in quasi-one-dimensionalsystems1989-91: Group Leader (Institute for Polymer Chemistry, Teltow)Since 1992: Group Leader (Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, Potsdam)1994:Habilitation, Theoretical Chemistry (Technical University, Berlin) Anchored Polymers - Self-Organization & Response to Perturbations 134Interfacial Phenomena Fig. 1: Morphology diagram of AB diblock copolymer brushes mixed with B-like nano-particles in the ( B, /H9272)- parameter space.

Field-regulated Force by Grafted Polyelectrolytes During the past couple of decades, investigations of theresponse of charged polymers, so-called polyelectrolytes, toexternal electric field attracted much scientific attention. Ifthe free end of a grafted polyelectrolyte is under load, whilethe chain itself is exposed to electric field that favors itsadsorption, both field strength and force determine the con-figuration of the chain. In particular, a restoring force mayarise if the chain is mechanically coupled to a deformable,nano-sized object such as another polymer chain or a col-loidal particle. In that case, force and length of the bulk poly-mer segment pulled off from the adsorption layer are deter-mined in a self-regulated manner. We study the response of grafted polyelectrolytes to elec- trostatic fields both theoretically and by means of moleculardynamics simulations. Two strictly different setups are consi -dered. First, we apply a constant force and analyze the lengthof the bulk part of the chain as a function of varying electricfield ( Fig. 3) [4]. Note that force is measured in units of kBT/b kBT/l B6 pNand electric field the dis- tance between charges. the Bjerrum length and e the ele - mentary charge. Our theory is based on a detailed descriptionof both adsorbed and bulk parts of the chain and goes beyondprevious studies. Fig. 3demonstrates quite clearly the agree- ment between simulation data and theory without any fittingpara meter. In addition, we observe that the length of the bulkpart may be fairly well estimated by a purely mechanical theory,which accounts only for force balance and yields = NEe ( inset of Fig. 3 ). Using our theory we are able to explain the surprising accuracy of the simple mechanical approach.In the second setup, the free end of a grafted polyelectrolyte islinked to a target body. Two different models are schematical-ly shown in Fig. 4. The right panel demonstrates also the work- ing principle of a possible nano-device. We consider a few tar-get bodies with different force-deformation relations both lin-ear and nonlinear ones [5]. Among the latter we focus on the so-called Hertzian force, which mimics the behavior of asqueezed colloidal particle. The predictions of our theory agreequantitatively with the results of the numerical simulations,while a zero-order approximation that corresponds to the pure-ly mechanical approach yields substantial deviations ( Fig. 5).

Traditionally, this process has been thought to be governed by a decay rate const - ant.Biochemists, however, have unveiled a large number of complex mechanisms underlying mRNA degradation. In addition, several measurements of mRNAturnover have shown that mRNA decay is rarely simple. The turnover of mRNA molecules introduces new time scalesthat interact with the timescales of translation and of celldivision. In [1]we have considered the interaction of the life- time distribution of an mRNA species with the timescale need -ed by ribosomes to build a stable poly some ( Fig. 1). The latter timescale is proportional to the length of the mRNA. Wehave found out that for very long mRNAs with a highturnover, the transient time until protein synthesis beginsmay be comparable with the lifetime of the mRNA thusaffecting both the protein synthesis rate and the size of thepolysome. Fig. 1: Translation and degradation of mRNA. (a) Prokaryotic mRNA and (b) the effect of endonucleolitic degradation on the polysome. (c) Eukary-otic mRNA. Degradation occurs in the 5' to the 3' direction. The analysis of experimental data from E. coli shows that longer mRNA produce, in general, fewer proteins than short-er mRNA if the lifetime distribution of the mRNA is short and exponential ( Fig. 2). Fig. 2: The interplay between degradation and loading of the polysome can produce a negative correlation between the number of proteins permRNA and its length. There is also an indication that mRNA degradation may af - fect the spatial distribution of the ribosomes on the mRNA.This point was investigated in [2]using flux balance equations and stochastic simulations. Since the lifetime distribution ofthe mRNA is not exponential, in [3]we have looked at the inter play between the shape of the lifetime distribution andthe timescales necessary to reach a steady state expressionlevel ( Fig. 3). Fig. 3: Two assumptions for the mRNA lifetime distributions lead to dif- ferent transient times. In E. coli the average mRNA lifetime is about fourminutes and its cell cycle has duration of twenty minutes. We found that mRNA characterized by broadly distributed lifetimes take longer to reach a steady state copy number sothat especially in bacteria certain mRNAs may never reach asteady state copy number before cell division. In [3]we did not investigate the origin of the different lifetime distributions,a topic that was left for further investigations published in [4]. Ribosomal profiling is a new ex peri mental technique that pro vides an in vivopicture of the translational state of the cell. With this technique one can investigate the variousmechanisms of translational control, which include the initia-tion rate by ribosomes and the codon dependent elongationrate. One important question that we wanted to address con-cerns the differential translational state of organisms underdifferent growth or stress conditions. To address this ques- and CorrelationFunctions1996-1998: Postdoc, (Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, Dresden)1998-2000: Postdoc (Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, Potsdam)Since 2000: Group Leader and IMPRS Coordinator, (Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, Potsdam)Stochastic Processes in Complex Bio-Systems COMPLEX SYSTEMS tion, in the framework of the Marie-Curie ITN \"NICHE\" Prof Zoya Ignatova and her lab at the University of Potsdam haveworked on the ribosomal profiles of E. colicell cultures under four different growth conditions. The analysis of the dataproduced with advanced bioinformatics tools [5], will be fur- ther statistically analyzed in a manuscript in preparation [6] to provide the most complete picture of the differential geneexpression in E. coliso far. This data will then become a use- ful benchmark for modelling the interaction of unicellular photo-synthetic alga. The cells of this organism have the specialproperty to remain in the growth phase for a random amountof time and attain, at a population level, a relatively broaddistribution of cell sizes. One consequence is that each moth-er cell can produce a number of daughter cells that is roughlyproportional to the logarithm of its size ( Fig. 4). Since cell vol- ume is often considered as a proxy for the cellular metabolicstate, one first objective has been to develop a model for thecell size distribution under time-independent conditions suchas those created in some bioreactors. The model can be usedto calculate and compare stationary distributions for thecommon binary and the multiple division processes [7]. The model has left many questions open. One biologically impor-tant question is whether the experimentally observed diversi-ty is solely given by the stochastic nature of cell growth anddivision or to the heterogeneous mixture over the phases ofthe cell cycle. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate if thevolume of the mother cells is the only determinant of thenumber of daughter cells. Fig. 4: Two chlamy daughter cells (bottom left) grow in time but divide at two different time points. Although the number of daughter cells is dif- ferent, their sizes are very similar. To investigate these points, Prof. Martin Steup and his lab at the University of Potsdam have performed a set of experi- ments with synchronized chlamy cells. The synchronization is obtained by cultivating the cells with fixed periods of lightand darkness, in a growth medium that does not allow forcell growth in the darkness. Synchronization relies on the fact that, under certain general conditions, all cells woulddivide after the start of the dark period and the daughter cellswould start to grow only when light is turned on again. Clear-ly, at the beginning of each light period all the cells are in thesame point of the cell cycle. The experiments showed us thatDNA replication occurs stochastically during the light periodaccording to relatively simple rules that we have been ableto cast in a stochastic model of cell growth and division. Theconclusion of this study [8], is that DNA replication is one major determinant of the number of daughter cells and thatits stochastic nature maintains the population heteroge-neous even under synchronization conditions. Markov Chains in Biological Processes Markov chains are a very common tool to mathematicallymodel biological processes. Fig. 5: The stochastic life of a single mRNA molecule is made of specific biochemical states. At each state, a transition to the next state or toabsorption is possible. The recent application of this tool in our group covers model- ling the complex life time of mRNA, where each moleculeundergoes several biochemical transitions until degradationtakes place ( Fig. 5, from Ref. [4]), and the stochastic lifetime of trabecular bones [9], within a project led by Dr. Richard Weinkamer in the Biomaterials department. We have consid-ered also mathematical models of molecular motors. In oneparticularly instructive work [10], we have considered a sim- ple model of molecular motors interacting with the fuel sub-strate. When the amount of fuel molecules is not constant,due to its stochastic consumption and replacement, the rateby which a motor receives the fuel varies stochastically intime. We could derive an analytical expression of the distribu-tion of the time that a motor has to wait for a fuel moleculeand found that it is not exponential. This implies that at lowmolecule number the law of mass action does not hold. Mod-els of molecular motors like Kinesin have also inspired sever-al problems in the mathematical theory of Markov chains thatwe have investigated in collaboration with Prof Sylvie Rllyat the Institute of Mathematics of the University of Potsdamand are going to be submitted soon [11,12].

In addition, however, biological pro - cesses also underlie functional require- ments and are the result of evolutionary selec tion. Our group is interested in the inter- play of physical and biological forces in com- plex living systems, with a focus on regulatory processes, mostly in bacterial systems. We address these issues in three interrelated areas of research: (i) Mole - cular machines, (ii) genetic circuits, and (iii) cellular dynam-ics. Our main interest is in characterizing how generic physi-cal processes enable, constrain and shape biological systemsand how biological systems make use of these processes orcircumvent them towards specific functions. Understandingthese issues is also expected to provide theoretical guidancefor applications in bioengineering and synthetic biology. Molecular Machines Cells contain billions of molecular machines that perform ahuge variety of functions from catalysis in metabolism to pro-cessing the genetic information. Complex behaviour of suchmachines can arise both at the level of the properties of indi-vidual molecules and at the level of assemblies of multiplemolecules [1]. Currently, we focus on the machines that read out the genetic information, RNA polymerases and ribo-somes. Important features of these machines are proofread-ing mechanisms to increase their accuracy. For individualmolecules, there is typically a trade-off between accuracyand speed of the read-out. Additional issues arise whenmany such machines process the same gene. For example,RNA polymerases have to move backward for proofreading. Atrailing RNA polymerase can block this backward movementand may thus interfere with the proofreading process. If thenegative effect is to be contained below a certain threshold,proofreading has to be faster than the arrival of a trailingRNA polymerase. This requirement provides a constraint onthe dynamics not present for individual molecules [2]. In addition to studying the mechanisms of these machin - es, we are interested in the economic principles that underlietheir use in cells. This line of research addresses aspectssuch as the number of these machines present in the cell,their distribution in space, their allocation to different func-tions, as well as their costs and benefits for the cell. Anintriguing observation in this respect is that ribosomes seemto be far more costly to the cell than RNA polymerases. Thecost of ribosomes reflects the intimate coupling of the cell'sribosome content and cell growth (synthesis of biomass andproliferation), which in turn is one of the main determinantsof fitness. A consequence of the fact that ribosomes repre-sent costly investments for the cell is that using them effi-ciently represents a fitness advantage. One mechanism toachieve this is the usage of 'fast codons': The genetic codeencodes most amino acids by several nucleotide triplets(codons), but synonymous codons may not be read out withthe same rate. The use of a codon that is read out slowlyincurs a fitness cost to the cell through the inefficient use ofribosomes. This fitness cost depends on how frequently theparticular codon is read out. As a consequence, sequences ofabundant proteins are more biased towards fast codons. Wehave analysed a quantitative evolution model based on this'ribosome load' idea and derived a simple relation betweenthe frequency of slow codons in a sequence and the abun-dance (copy number in the cell) of the corresponding protein [3]. This relation provides a simple quantitative estimate of protein abundance from sequence data alone ( Fig. 1). Fig. 1: Protein abundance predicted from genomic sequences: Relation between fraction of slow codons (r) and protein abundance (N) and cor-relation between predicted and measured abundance for E. coli [3]. 138 Stefan Klumpp 29.09.1973 1999:Diploma, Physics (University of (University Colloids and Interfaces, Potsdam)Thesis: Movements of molecularmotors: Diffusion and directed Research associate (MPI of Colloids and Interfaces, Potsdam)2006-2009: Postdoc (University of California, San (MPI of Colloids and Interfaces, Potsdam)Regulation of Bio-ProcessesCOMPLEX SYSTEMS Gene Regulation and Genetic Circuits The readout of individual genes is tightly regulated inresponse to intracellular and external signals. Networks ofgenes regulating each other (via their protein products) areoften compared to electronic circuits where complex func-tions arise from combinatorics with a limited set of basiccomponents. This analogy is the basis for the design of syn-thetic gene circuits, which are then implemented on a cellu-lar 'chassis'. However, unlike in electronics, the chassis here(the host cell) is itself a dynamic and adaptive object and thecircuits are not isolated from the chassis to which they arecoupled through sharing of metabolites and molecular machin-ery. As a consequence, changes in the state of the cell as awhole may affect individual circuits that are nominally unrelat-ed to host cell functions. One specific example, which we haveanalysed recently, is the dependence of plasmid copy numberon the growth rate of the host cell ( Fig. 2). Such dependence affects the expression of all genes on the plasmid includingthose controlling plasmid replication, and thus its copy num-ber. We have shown that information on such growth-ratedependencies can be used to obtain information about thedesign of the control system of plasmid replication [4]. A re - lated issue is the systematic variation of protein concentra-tions that arises from the division cycle of the host cell. Thisvariation provides a deterministic contribution to the obser -ved 'noise' in protein synthesis [5]. Fig. 2: Control systems of plasmid replication: Whether or not a plasmid is replicated depends on binding of a regulatory RNA (RNA I) to thereplication primer (RNA II). The growth state of the host cell affects theconcentrations of both RNAs. Cellular Dynamics In our third research area, we study the dynamics of structureformation in cells and the movements of cells. Recently wehave focused on magnetotactic bacteria, in collaborationwith the group of D. Faivre (Department Biomaterials). Mag-netotactic bacteria orient in a magnetic field based on achain of organelles called magnetosomes that contain mag-netic nanoparticles. The magnetosome chain acts as a cellu-lar compass needle. Magnetotactic bacteria provide an ex -cellent model system to study what role generic physicalinteractions (magnetic attraction and repulsion) have in aspe cific biological context and how they are integrated withmore specific biological mechanism. In a first project, wehave studied the formation of the magnetosome chain. Wedeveloped a computer simulation based on experimentaldata for chain formation in iron-starved cells ( Fig. 3). Our main question was whether the magnetic interactions betweenthe magnetosomes are sufficient to induce chain formation.Simulations allow us to study 'in-silico mutants' defectivenot in individual genes, but in entire physical processes (i.e.non-magnetic mutants), which may be hard or impossible toobtain by experimental mutagenesis. The results of thesesimulation show that the magnetic interactions alone are notsufficient to explain the experimental observations. Ratherwe find that robust chain formation requires the interplay ofmagnetic interactions and controlled active transport [6]. Oth- er topics we are currently addressing are the interactions ofthese bacteria with external magnetic fields and variousmodes of bacterial motility. Fig. 3: Simulation of the formation of a magnetosome chain [6]: Initially non-magnetic magnetosomes (black) develop a magnetic nanoparticle(red or green indicate different directions of the magnetic moment) andalign in the center of the cell with uniform magnetization.
