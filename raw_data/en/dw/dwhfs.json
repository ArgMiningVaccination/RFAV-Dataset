The essential oils in natural mosquito repellents work by blocking mosquitoes' sense of smell and making it difficult for them to land on human skin. It's a similar effect to the chemical DEET. [Studies have shown](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-10-S1-S11) that natural repellents work as effectively as their synthetic chemical counterparts when applied consistently. For example, an [American College of Clinical Pharmacy](https://accpjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/phar.1854) study found that certain essential oils ranked just behind DEET in terms of effectively repelling mosquitoes. Recently, lemon-eucalyptus essential oil was registered with the [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you) and approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a safer and effective non-toxic mosquito repellent.
