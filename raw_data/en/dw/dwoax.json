He's the author of the award-winning book \"Moonshots: Creating a World of Abundance,\" and his current adventures are Moon Express, which is a space company, and Viome. His current work is in Viome Life Sciences, which was founded in 2016 with a mission of making illness optional by predicting and preventing chronic disease through a deeper understanding of an individual's biology at a molecular level. It is built on an AI-driven platform that analyzes the interaction between food, our microbiome, and our human selves to develop precision recommendations to prevent and reverse chronic disease. In this episode, we talk about the human ecosystem and personalized optimization of your gut health and your overall health. We talk about the reason the gut affects the entire body, why it's not just genetics from our parents but actually our ecosystem within our gut that controls our body. We also dive into how microbiome balance begins at birth, how 90% of serotonin is produced in the gut (not the brain), and how some foods can be good for some people and not others.
