Molina, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Allergy Symptoms and Triggers Natural Allergy Relief Teas and Herbs for Allergies Teas to Avoid Frequently Asked Questions Grass, trees, weeds, and flowering plants release allergens that can cause a variety of allergy symptoms, including coughing, sneezing, and itchy and watery eyes. To relieve the discomfort of these symptoms, you can take over-the-counter or prescription medications, such as antihistamines. Certain herbs and teas like green tea and stinging nettle tea contain antihistamines and may also help you reduce symptoms. Verywell / Jessica Olah Allergy Symptoms and Triggers Allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, develops when the body's immune system recognizes and overreacts to something in the environment that typically causes no problems in most people. It can be seasonal or perennial. Seasonal allergies occur in spring, summer, and early fall. During these times, airborne mold spores or pollens from trees, grass, and weeds can trigger symptoms like sneezing and congestion. Perennial allergies occur year-round and are caused by many factors, including cigarette smoke, perfume, diesel exhaust, dust mites, pet hair or dander, cockroaches, or mold. Symptoms of hay fever may include: Fatigue because of a decrease in sleep quality due to nasal congestion Itchy eyes, nose, mouth, and skin Sneezing Stuffy nose Rash Some people may also have a condition called pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS) associated with pollen allergy or hay fever. Symptoms to the mouth are immediate, and may include itching, irritations, and swelling of the lips, tongue, roof of the mouth, and throat, but go away as soon as the person stops eating. To avoid this type of reaction, only eat vegetables and fruits that are cooked. An Overview of Hay Fever Rash Natural Allergy Relief An integrative approach using both natural remedies and medications may provide the best treatment for hay fever symptoms. Herbs and teas are among the many complementary and alternative therapies that may help. Before you take herbal extracts or drink infusions, however, speak with your doctor to make sure they won't interact with other medications you may take for your allergies or other conditions. Teas and Herbs for Allergies Some herbs and teas that have antihistamine properties may include: Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica): This is a medicinal plant with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may reduce allergy symptoms. One study showed positive effects of stinging nettle extract on hay fever, but the placebo showed similar effects. Researchers concluded that larger and longer studies are needed to verify the benefits of stinging nettle for allergies. Ginger (Zingiber officinale): This is a flowering plant whose root is used as a spice in cooking. One study showed that ginger extract and loratadine, a medication for treating allergies, were equally good and both improved nasal symptoms in allergic rhinitis patients. The ginger extract also caused fewer side effects. Green tea: This has also shown to hinder mast cell activation and block histamines. In a double-blind clinical trial, participants allergic to Japanese cedar pollinosis drank benifuuki green tea, and by the eleventh week of the trial, at the height of cedar pollen season, researcher saw reduced symptoms in the participants. However, green tea allergies also exist. Licorice root (Glycyrrhiza uralensis): This is used to treat several inflammatory diseases, including allergies. Because of its strong anti-inflammatory properties, it may help reduce allergy symptoms. Studies with mice showed positive results after three days. However, more human studies are necessary to examine its positive effects on allergic rhinitis Rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus): This has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and is used in many respiratory disorders. Research supports the use of rosemary in the prevention and treatment of asthma and allergies. Turmeric (Curcuma longa): In one study, turmeric was shown to have anti-allergic properties that blocked histamine release from mast cells. Studies have found that it helped reduce the allergic response in animals. However, more human research is needed to confirm these results.

If hollyhocks cause allergy symptoms, avoid hibiscus tea that comes from the Malvaceae family of plants. A Word From Verywell There's no question that a cup of herbal tea can be very soothing.
