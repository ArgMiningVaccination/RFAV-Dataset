STDs, or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are caused by bacteria, parasites, or viruses. There are about 20 million new STD infections each year in the United States. There are 20 types of infections spread by sexual contact. These often show different signs of infection or no signs at all. You can have an STD and not know it. Bacterial STDs can be treated and cured with antibiotics. These include: Chlamydia. Gonorrhea. Syphilis. Viral STDs that can be managed with treatment. These include: Hepatitis. Herpes. HIV. HPV.Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) The only way to know if you have an STD is by a medical exam and testing from your health care provider.www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn4 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsHow do you know if you have an STD? Your health care provider (HCP) can examine and test you for STDs. Some men are at a higher risk for getting STDs. They should have regular exams and testing. Higher risk men include those who: Have had a previous STD. Have new or multiple sexual partners. Men who have sex with men (MSM). Use condoms only some of the time. Have sex for drugs or money. Use needles for illegal drugs.How can men avoid STDs? Avoid sexual contact. l This includes vaginal, anal, oral sex, or genital touching. l This is the only way to be absolutely sure of avoiding STDs. Have safer sex: l Reduce the number of sexual partners. l Always use condoms and use correctly. l Have sex with only one partner who does not have sex with others and does not have an STD. l Limit or stop drug and alcohol use before and during sex. The Role of Circumcision What Is circumcision? Male circumcision is the surgical removal of some or the entire foreskin covering the tip of the penis. Germs can grow under the foreskin and create hygiene problems. Why do men get circumcised? Parents made the decision when they were an infant. Religious, social, or cultural reasons. Medical reasons (to prevent infections or fix tight foreskin). If you have an STD, tell current and recent sex partners of the infection For more information, see Safer Sex on page 71Veterans Health Administration5 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsBenefits of circumcision Research studies have shown that male circumcision lowers the risk of: Acquiring HIV, genital herpes, human papilloma virus and syphilis. Penile cancer over a lifetime. Cervical cancer in sex partners. Urinary tract infections in the first year of life.Uncircumcised men can speak with their health care provider about: How circumcision may impact disease and infections. How circumcision may impact sexual sensitivity. Benefits and risks of the procedure. Who will perform the procedure.

Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the U.S. Chlamydia How is it spread? Men get chlamydia through vaginal, oral, or anal sex (or sexual contact) with an infected partner. What are signs of chlamydia in men? There may be no signs or symptoms of infection. Symptoms may not appear until several weeks after exposure and can include: Pain/burning with urination. Watery/mucus discharge from penis. Redness, swelling or itching at the tip of the penis. Hard to start urination. Blood in semen or urine. Discomfort during sex. Rectal pain, bleeding, or discharge. Testicular pain, tenderness and swelling (less common). See your health care provider to be tested if you have signs of chlamydia.www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn8 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsHow do you know if you have chlamydia? The only way to know if you have chlamydia is by a medical exam. Many men with chlamydia do not have any signs of infection and routine testing is not recommended. Get tested if you: Have an oral, anal or vaginal sex partner who has been recently diagnosed with an STD. Are sexually active and have signs as listed above. Are having sex with someone who might be having sex with others. How is it treated? Chlamydia can be treated and cured with antibiotics. Always finish antibiotic treatment, even if signs of chlamydia go away. Do not have sex until after treatment and signs of it are gone. See your health care provider if your signs do not go away after treatment. People who have had chlamydia and have been treated may get infected again if they have sexual contact with a person infected with chlamydia.What can happen if you have chlamydia for a long time? Swelling in the anus. Eye and joint redness and pain. Inflammation of the liver capsule resulting in right sided abdominal pain. More likely to get HIV from a partner who is infected with HIV. If you have chlamydia: Always finish all antibiotic treatment. Do not have sex with someone who has chlamydia or has not finished treatment (to prevent re-infection). Tell current and recent sex partners of the infection so they can get checked. Know that it can increase the risk of getting and spreading HIV. Chlamydia trachomatis microscopyVeterans Health Administration9 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsHow can you avoid chlamydia? Avoid sexual contact. Have safer sex: l Reduce the number of sexual partners. l Condoms, when used correctly, can reduce the risk of getting chlamydia. Each time you have sex use a condom: n During vaginal sex. n During anal sex. n During oral sex. l Have sex with only one partner who does not have sex with others and does not have chlamydia.

HSV-1 can also cause genital herpes. More often it causes blisters of the mouth and lips (e.g., cold sores or fever blisters). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that over 50 million persons, or about 1 out of 6 people ages 14 to 49 in the U.S. have genital herpes. It occurs in about 1 in 8 men. Many people with herpes have no signs of infection and do not know they have it. They can still pass it to others.How is it spread? The herpes virus is spread by skin-to-skin contact with a person who has it: Most often, from herpes sores or blisters. Less often, from normal looking skin where the virus first entered the body. During vaginal, anal, or oral sexual contact, or skin-to-skin contact. This may happen even without visible sores. The herpes virus gets into the body from: l The lining of the mouth. l Regular skin that has small cracks or cuts.Genital herpes is a chronic, life-long, sexually transmitted disease caused by two herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2). Those who don't know they have herpes can still spread the virus to others. Herpes is more easily spread from men to women than from women to men.www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn12 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsThose with a weak immune system can get herpes infection more easily. A weak immune system is caused by some diseases (e.g., cancer, HIV/AIDS) and by some medicines used to treat serious diseases. What are signs of genital herpes in men? Men who have the herpes virus may have no outbreaks or signs of infection. Many do not know they have the virus. Once you are infected, the virus stays in your nerve cells for life. When the virus is not active, there is no sign of infection. When the virus becomes active, a herpes outbreak occurs. Some men may: Not have any outbreaks. Have only one outbreak. Have multiple outbreaks. First Outbreak The first herpes outbreak often occurs within two weeks after sexual contact with an infected person. Sometimes the first outbreak will not occur until months or years after the first infection. The first signs may include: Itching, tingling, or burning feeling in the genital area. Flu-like symptoms, including fever. Swollen glands. Pain or tingling in the legs, buttocks, or anal area. Headache. A feeling of pressure in the area below the stomach.After a few days, painful sores, blisters, or ulcers may appear where the virus entered the body. These areas include: Genital or anal area. The mouth. In the urinary tract. On the buttocks or thighs. On other parts of your body where the virus has entered. Other Outbreaks After the first outbreak, you may have more outbreaks. For most, these occur less often over time. The signs of herpes infection are mostly milder than during the first outbreak, and they go away faster. For those with a weak immune system, outbreaks can be severe and long-lasting. See your health care provider (HCP) to be tested if you have signs of herpes. Veterans Health Administration13 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsHow do you know if you have genital herpes? The only way to know if you have genital herpes is by a medical exam. Your HCP can examine you and test for it. Lab samples are taken from a sore, blister, or blood. Your HCP may ask to test you for other infections at the same time. How is it treated? Genital herpes can be treated, but it cannot be cured. Antiviral drugs may be used during an outbreak to help to make it: Shorter. Less severe. Less frequent. Antivirals can also be taken daily to reduce outbreaks. Living with genital herpes causes some to: Feel embarrassed or ashamed. Worry about infecting a sexual partner. Worry that having herpes will affect relationships with sexual partners. Avoid dating or sexual relationships. Most people with herpes are able to live with the virus and manage outbreaks. Talking to trusted HCPs and friends can help. Discuss treatment options with your HCP. Also talk about ways to reduce passing the virus to others.During outbreaks of genital herpes, you should: Keep the infected area clean and dry. Avoid touching the sores or blisters. Clean hands after contact with the infected area. Avoid skin-to-skin contact from the time you first notice signs of herpes until the sores have healed. Avoid sexual activity. How can you avoid genital herpes? Most men get genital herpes from sexual contact with a person who has herpes. You can get the virus without having sex. To avoid it: Do not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Avoid skin-to-skin and sexual contact. If you do have sex, practice safe sex: l Reduce the number of sexual partners. l Use condoms correctly. Condoms can reduce the risk of getting genital herpes. But, condoms may not cover all infected areas. Each time you have sex use a condom (male or female type): n During vaginal sex. n During anal sex. n During oral sex. l Have sex with only one partner who does not have sex with others and does not have herpes. Drugs can help lower the chance that you will pass the virus to others. Tell past and current sex partners of your herpes infection.

Men can get genital warts from sexual contact with someone who has HPV. Genital warts are spread by skin-to-skin contact, usually from contact with the warts. It can be spread by vaginal, anal, oral, or hand-genital sexual contact. Genital warts will spread HPV while visible and after recent treatment. Long-term sexual partners usually have the same type of wart- causing HPV. What are signs of genital warts in men? Genital warts can grow anywhere in the genital area: On the groin. Under the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis. On the shaft of the circumcised penis. In or around the anus. In the mouth or throat (rare).Genital warts appear as a small bump or groups of bumps in the genital area. They can be small or large, raised or flat, or shaped like a cauliflower. They are caused by some types of human papilloma virus (HPV). These viruses may not cause warts in everyone.www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn16 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsGenital warts: Can be any size - from so small they can't be seen, to big clusters and lumps. Can be smooth with a \"mosaic\" pattern or bumpy like a cauliflower. Are soft, moist and flesh-colored. Can cause itching, burning or pain. Not all HPV infections cause genital warts. HPV infections often do not have any signs that you can see or feel. Some HPV infections can be more serious, see HPV and Men, page 30. How is it treated? See your health care provider (HCP) to discuss treatment. Even when genital warts are treated, the HPV infection may remain. Warts may also return after treatment. Over-the-counter treatments for other types of warts should not be used. Treatments include: Medicines (creams, ointments, solutions or gels) applied directly to the warts. Burning off the warts. Freezing off the warts. Cutting the warts out. Using special lights or lasers to destroy the warts.What can happen if you have genital warts for a long time? The immune system fights HPV infection. The types of HPV that cause genital warts do not cause cancer. Without any treatment, genital warts may: Go away. Remain unchanged. Increase in size or number. If you have genital warts: Talk with your HCP about treatment. Know that you may never know when you got HPV or who you got it from. Know that partners who have been together for a while can have the same HPV types, even if both have no signs. Even if you see no visible genital warts, you could still have HPV infection. Condoms may not fully protect against HPV since HPV can infect areas not covered by a condom.

The late stage of HIV infection is known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). With medicines, the virus can be controlled so AIDS may not occur.How is it spread? Each year in the U.S. about 50,000 people get infected with HIV. More than 1.2 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV infection and approximately 13% are not aware they are infected. Men account for 76% of all adults and adolescents living with HIV. The HIV virus is found only in certain body fluids: Blood. Vaginal fluid. Semen. Breast milk.HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. HIV is a virus that attacks and weakens the immune system. The immune system is the body's defense against infections. HIV is NOT spread by: Tears Sweat Feces Urine Salivawww.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn24 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsContact with infected body fluids can spread HIV by: Sexual contact. l Vaginal and anal sex. l Sharing unclean sex toys. l Oral sex, very rarely. l Body fluids with HIV can enter tiny breaks or rips in the linings of the rectum or mouth. Rips and tears may not be seen or felt. Needle sharing: l Used or unclean needles. l During illegal drug use. Breast feeding: l HIV can be spread to babies and others who drink breast milk from a woman who is HIV positive. Pregnancy and birth: l HIV-positive women can spread the virus to their babies during pregnancy and birth. HIV is rarely spread from a blood transfusion because: All donated blood is tested for HIV. There is no risk of getting HIV when donating blood.What are signs of HIV? Most people with HIV will not show signs of HIV until years after getting the virus. Those who have been infected with HIV may have: Fever. Chills. Night sweats. Headache. Sore throat. Swollen lymph nodes, mainly on the neck. Tiredness. Rash. Sores or infections in the mouth. Body aches. How do you know if you have HIV? The only way to know you have HIV is by getting an HIV test. Routine HIV testing is recommended for all adults. HIV tests are offered by health care providers (HCP) in doctor's offices, hospitals, local public health departments, and in local clinics. Most HIV tests use either blood or saliva. HIV tests are very accurate but may not show HIV from a recent infection. Always discuss your test result and retesting with your test provider. You can't tell if a person is HIV infected by looking at them. VA offers HIV testing and treatment to all enrolled Veterans. Veterans Health Administration25 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsHow is it treated? There is no cure for HIV. But there are medicines to help your body fight HIV. Your HCP can help you choose which to take and when to start. Treatment is lifelong. It can: Reduce the amount of virus in your body. Reduce the spread of HIV to others. Help most people with HIV live longer and healthier lives. What can happen if you have HIV for a long time? If HIV is not diagnosed and treated, it can progress into AIDS. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection. When you have AIDS, the virus has greatly weakened your immune system. If HIV is not treated, other infections can occur that can be life threatening. The only way to know if you have AIDS is through a medical exam and testing by your HCP. Signs of AIDS are: Rapid weight loss. Fevers. Night sweats. Extreme tiredness. Swelling of the lymph nodes in the armpits, groin, or neck which doesn't go away. Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week. Sores of the mouth, anus, or genitals. Infections such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and certain cancers. Red, brown, pink, or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids. Depression. Memory loss and other brain or nerve problems. If you have HIV: See a HCP regularly. Take medicines as prescribed. Tell current and recent sex partners that you have HIV. Avoid spreading HIV to others by: l Using condoms during all sexual contact. l Not sharing used or unclean needles and sex toys. The sooner you know if you have HIV, the sooner your HCP can know when you will need treatment.www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn26 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsHow can you avoid HIV? The best ways to avoid HIV are: Not having sexual contact. Using condoms during all sexual contact. Not using or injecting illegal drugs. If you do, use a new sterile needle and drug equipment each time to prep and inject drugs. Other ways to avoid HIV are: Having less sex partners. Have sex with only one partner: l Who does not have HIV. l Who does not have sex with others. Not reusing or sharing needles or drug equipment (works). If unused (new) needles and sterile works are not used: l Boil in water, or l Clean with bleach water and rinse with water before each use. Ask your sex partners to test for HIV and other STDs For more information, see Safer Sex on page 71 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) PrEP is medicine taken daily. When used with safer sex practices it prevents HIV infection. Truvada\u00ae is the pill that is used for PrEP. It is more than 90% effective if taken as prescribed. Discuss PrEP with your health care provider if you: l Are sexually active. l Are an injection drug user. l Have one or more of these risk factors for HIV: n Inconsistent condom use. n High number of sex partners. n HIV-positive sex partner. n A recent STD, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis. n An HIV-positive injecting partner. n Sharing of injection equipment. n Commercial sex work.Veterans Health Administration27 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing Infections Learn more: Veterans Health Library: http://www.veteranshealthlibrary.org/Encyclopedia/142,82145_VA Department of Veterans Affairs (VA): VA National HIV/AIDS Website; for Veterans and the Public www.hiv.va.gov/patient/ U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): HIV/AIDS Basicswww.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): HIV Among Men in the United Stateshttps://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/men/index.html HIV/AIDS Basics https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/index.html Oral Sex and HIV Risk https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/oralsex.html HIV Transmission https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/transmission.html National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID/NIH): What are HIV and AIDS?www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/Pages/whatAreHIVAIDS.aspx Office on Women's Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: https://www.womenshealth.gov/mens-health/top-health-concerns-for-men/hiv-aids.htmlVeterans Health Administration29 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing Infections Human Papillomavirus (HPV) There are over 100 known types of HPV. About 40 types can infect female and male genital areas. Genital HPV is grouped into two types: Low-risk types can cause genital warts or may be harmless. High-risk types can raise the chances for cancer of the penis and anus.How is it spread? HPV is spread by skin-to-skin contact. Men get HPV from sexual contact with someone who has it. HPV can be spread by vaginal, anal, oral or hand-genital sexual contact. Some may have no signs of HPV but can still spread it to others. People can have more than one type of HPV. Long-term sex partners with HPV often have the same HPV types. Risk of having HPV rise if you: Have been sexually active at an earlier age. Have multiple sex partners. Smoke. Have a weak immune system due to: l A medical condition (cancer or HIV). l Medicines.Human papilloma virus or HPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States. About 79 million Americans have HPV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says one in two sexually active people will have HPV at some point in their life. Most sexually active men and women get genital HPV at some time in their lives.www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn30 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsWhat are signs of HPV in men? If you have HPV, you may not be able to see or feel it. You can have HPV even if years since your last sexual contact with an infected person. You may never know which sex partner gave you HPV. HPV infection may cause: Genital warts (low-risk HPV). l See Genital Warts (page 17) for more information. Cancer (high-risk HPV). l Cancer of the penis (more common). l Cancers of the anus, throat, tongue or tonsils (less common). How do you know if you have HPV? Most men with HPV have no signs or signs go away on their own. Right now, there is no approved test for HPV in men. Testing before having signs is not recommended. Some providers may offer anal Papanicolaou or \"PAP\" tests to men who are at high risk for anal cancer (men with HIV or those who receive anal sex). How is it treated? Genital HPV infections are very common but: Most show no signs. Most go away with no treatment within a few years. If HPV does not go away, treatments are not the same for low risk HPV and high-risk HPV: Low-Risk HPV (Genital warts) - Even when treated, virus may remain. Warts can also come back after treatment. Over-the-counter medicines for other types of warts should not be used. Treatments include: l Watch and wait to see if the warts stay the same, get bigger, or go away. l Medicines put on the warts. l Burning off the warts. l Freezing off the warts. l Cutting the warts out. l Using special lights or lasers to destroy the warts. High-Risk HPV - cancers from HPV are more treatable if found and treated promptly. What can happen if you have HPV for a long time? Some types of low-risk HPV can cause genital warts. If not treated, genital warts may: Go away. Remain unchanged. Increase in size or number. See Genital Warts (page 17) for more information. High-risk HPV can cause cancer. See your provider if you have strange growths, lumps or sores on your penis, scrotum, anus, mouth, or throat. If you have HPV: Talk to your health care provider (HCP). Know that long time sex partners often share the same HPV types, even if both have no signs. Veterans Health Administration31 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsHow can you avoid HPV? Get the vaccine for HPV. l One type of HPV vaccine can protect against the low-risk HPV that causes 90% of genital warts. l It is for all males 11 or 12 years old - up to 26 years of age for men with weak immune systems and men who have sex with men. l The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends all 11-12 year old girls and boys get the HPV vaccine. Avoid sexual contact. Have safer sex: l Reduce the number of sexual partners. l Condoms, when used correctly, can reduce the risk of getting HPV. But, condoms may not cover all infected areas. Each time you have sex use a condom (male or female type): n During vaginal sex. n During anal sex. n During oral sex. Have sex with only one partner who does not have sex with others and does not have HPV. Condoms may not fully protect against HPV since HPV can infect areas not covered by a condom.

Men get syphilis from sexual contact with someone who has it. Anyone with syphilis can spread it to others. Those who have it may not show signs or know they have it. Syphilis can be spread by contact with a syphilis sore which occurs on external genitals, vagina, anus, or in the rectum. Syphilis can be spread between: Men and women. Men and men.What are signs of syphilis in men? There are four stages of syphilis. Each is defined by how long the person has had it. Signs vary in each stage. 1. Primary Stage: The first sign of syphilis is often a small, round, firm sore. These appear at the place where it entered the body such as the penis, tongue, or lips. Most do not cause pain. There can also be more than one sore. Signs often go away in about 3 to 6 weeks even without treatment. If not treated in this stage, it will progress into the other stages.Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by bacteria.www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn34 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing Infections2. Secondary Stage: This stage can start with a rash over one or more areas of the body. These appear mostly on the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet. Other signs may be: l Sores in the mouth or anus. l Sore throat. l Swollen glands. l Large, raised gray/white lesions in mouth, underarm, or groin area. l Fever. l Hair loss in patches. l Head and muscle aches. l Weight loss. l Tiredness. If not treated in this stage, signs will still go away. However, the syphilis bacteria are still in the body. The infection will progress into the latent stage. 3. Latent Stage: This stage is also called the hidden stage. It can last many years. Syphilis remains in the body with no signs of infection. Without treatment, syphilis can pass to the Late Stage. This can take 10 to 20 years. 4. Late Stage: Syphilis in this stage can cause: l Numbness. l Problems with blood vessels. l Damage to bones and joints. l Difficulty walking. l Blindness. l Paralysis. l Brain damage. l Dementia. l Heart disease. l Death.How do you know if you have syphilis?

Syphilis can be cured with antibiotics in all stages of the disease. Always finish treatment. Do not have sex until after treatment and signs of it are gone. See your HCP if your signs do not go away after treatment. Some damage to your body caused by the disease may remain. If you have syphilis: Always finish all antibiotic treatment. Do not have sex with someone who has syphilis or has not finished treatment (to prevent re-infection). Tell current and recent sex partners of the infection so they can get checked. Know that it can raise the risk of getting and spreading HIV. Get tested again after 6 and 12 months. Only a HCP can tell you when you no longer have it.

In some cases, your health care provider (HCP) may take a liver biopsy. A needle is used to remove a tiny piece of liver. This will help to know the degree of liver damage. How is it treated? Chronic Hepatitis C is curable. If you have chronic hepatitis C infection, your HCP will examine you for liver problems. Talk to your HCP about treatment that can: Clear the virus from the body. Slow down or prevent liver damage. Lower the chance of getting cirrhosis and liver cancer. Talk with your HCP about all options before treatment. Treatment may not be for everyone. Some patients might not need it. Others might not be able to be treated due to other medical problems. www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn54 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsWhat can happen if hepatitis C is not treated? Of every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately: 75-85 will go on to develop chronic infection. 60-70 will go on to develop chronic liver disease. 5-20 will go on to develop cirrhosis over a period of 20-30 years. 1-5 will die from the consequences of chronic infection (liver cancer or cirrhosis) Chronic hepatitis C infection is the leading cause of liver cancer and cirrhosis in the U.S. Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver which causes it to not work well. Both liver cancer and cirrhosis can be fatal. A liver transplant may be needed if chronic hepatitis C causes the liver to fail. If you have hepatitis C: See your HCP regularly. Tell current and recent sex partners. Get vaccinated against hepatitis A and B. Get plenty of rest. Eat healthy foods. Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid drinking any alcohol. There are ways to help you stop drinking alcohol at: www.hepatitis. va.gov/patient/alcohol/what-you-can-do. asp or https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/res-vatreatmentprograms.asp. Check with your HCP before taking: l Prescription drugs. l Vitamins and supplements. l Over-the-counter drugs. Avoid spreading hepatitis C to others by: l Having safer sex and using condoms during all sexual contact. l Not sharing used or unclean needles and sex toys. l Not donating blood, blood products, or organs. l Cleaning all blood spills - even those that have already dried. Use a mixture of bleach and water (one part household bleach to 10 parts water). Even dried blood is a risk to others. l Not sharing personal care items like razors, toothbrushes, nail clippers or earrings. l Not sharing glucose-monitoring equipment. l Asking your sexual partner(s) to be tested for hepatitis C (and perhaps other infections). If you have hepatitis C, you can prevent liver damage by not drinking alcohol. Get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B. Veterans Health Administration55 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsHow can you avoid hepatitis C? Right now there is no vaccine to protect you against hepatitis C. You can take steps to protect yourself: Never share needles, syringes, water, or \"works\" for intravenous drug use, to inject steroids, or cosmetic substances.

It causes pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis and can last longer than 6 weeks. In older men, acute epididymitis may be due to a recent prostate biopsy or urinary tract procedure or surgery. It can also be due to sexual contact and from a weak immune system. www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn64 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsWhat are signs? Epididymitis may start with a low fever, chills and a heavy feeling in the testicle area: l The area will get more sensitive to pressure and become painful as it progresses. l This infection can easily spread to the testicles.

Even children can get shingles. For some people over age 60, shingles will cause severe pain which can last for months, even years. Who is at risk? You have a high risk of getting shingles if: Your immune system doesn't work well. You have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). You take drugs that suppress your immune system. Most people have just one outbreak of shingles in their lifetime, but some can have more.Shingles (Herpes Zoster)Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). This is the same virus that causes chickenpox. 1 out of every 3 people in the U.S. will get shingles (herpes zoster) in their lifetime. There are about 1 million cases of shingles every year in the U.S.www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn68 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing Infections What are signs of shingles? Most get a painful rash or blisters on one side of the body. These scab over in 7-10 days and clear in 2-4 weeks. There can be pain, itching or tingling in the rash/blister area. This can happen 1-5 days before it can be seen. The rash/blister can occur: l in a single patch or a stripe around the left side of the body. l in a single patch or a stripe around the right side of the body. l on one side of the face. In rare cases, the rash can look like chickenpox. Other signs that are not always present may include: Fever. Headache. General ill feeling. Joint pain. Muscle weakness. Can I give it to someone else? The virus that causes shingles can be spread from a person with active shingles to a person who has never had chickenpox. The person exposed may get chickenpox but not shingles. The virus is spread by direct contact with fluid from the blisters caused by shingles. Shingles does not spread before the blisters appear. When the blisters dry up (crust over) the person can no longer spread the virus.What can happen if you have it for a long time? Shingles that occurs on the face or scalp can affect the eye and cause a loss of vision. Rarely, it can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, brain inflammation, and even death. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox. The chance of spread is very low if the rash/blister is covered.

Safer sex can reduce your exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). STDs are spread by sexual contact with an infected person. This occurs through vaginal, anal or oral sex, and genital touching. Having safer sex is one of the best ways to protect yourself from STDs. The only way sure way of avoiding STDs is to not have any sexual contact.How are barriers used? Use each time you have sex. They can be made of plastic or latex and protect against viral and bacterial STDs. Use for: l Vaginal sex. l Anal sex. l Oral sex. Talk to your partner about using barriers before sex. Know that alcohol and drugs can alter how you think about if, when, or how to use barriers. Agree what type to use: male or female condoms, dental dams or other barriers. l Make sure to have these on hand if there is any chance you may have sex.Safer sex uses barriers to reduce the risk of blood or body fluids entering the body. The most common barrier used is the male condom. Barriers should be used during all sexual contact. These barriers include: male condoms, female condoms, dental dams and other barrierswww.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn72 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsMale Condoms Use for oral, anal or vaginal sex. Choose lubricated latex condoms: l \"Lambskin\" condoms do not block HIV or other STDs. l If you have allergies to latex, choose polyurethane (plastic) condoms. Use before date expires. Store in a cool, dry place. Use a new condom for each sex act, from start to finish. Make sure there are no holes in the package. Check the condom for rips or signs of damage like brittleness or stickiness. Place the condom only on the erect penis. Hold onto the tip as you unroll it down the penis shaft. Use a water-soluble lubricant (e.g., ID Glide, K-Y Jelly, Slippery Stuff, Foreplay, Wet, and Astroglide) after it is on. This prevents the condom from breaking. l Do not use petroleum jelly, massage oils, mineral oil, cooking oil, body lotions, butter, Crisco, Vaseline, or hand creams as lubricant. These can weaken condoms. Remove the condom after ejaculation, but before the penis gets soft. Avoid spilling ejaculate. If it breaks, remove it. Put on a new one. Use on sex toys such as dildos or vibrators that are shared: l Use new ones for each partner. l Clean sex toys after each use.Female Condoms Use during vaginal sex. Note its shape is not like the male condom. Made of a plastic called polyurethane. Use before the expiration date. Store in a cool, dry place. Use a new one for each sex act, from start to finish. Make sure there are no holes in the package. Check the condom for rips or signs of damage like brittleness or stickiness. Put on lubricant before inserting the condom. l Female condoms are already lubricated. l Water or oil-based lubes can be used. l Put lube on the inside and outside of the condom. Put it in the vagina no more than eight hours before having sex and before the start of any sexual contact. Squeeze the ring of the closed end and insert into the back of the vagina. Keep the open end outside of the vagina, covering the lip area. If the outer ring slips into the vagina, or if the penis goes outside of the condom pouch, remove and replace it. After sex, remove it by twisting the outside ring to trap any fluid before standing up. Throw it in the trash. Condoms kept in a wallet, stored somewhere warm, or that have been washed in the washer should not be used. Veterans Health Administration73 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing Infections Both male and female condoms can be found without co-pay at the VA pharmacy. Dental Dams Dental dams are a square piece of latex (rubber) found at surgical supply stores. Use dental dams for vaginal or anal contact during oral sex.Other Barriers Other barriers listed below can also be used to make oral sex safer. These work by reducing contact between blood or fluids and the mouth. Place over the opening to the vagina or anus During oral sex. A natural latex sheet. A \"cut open\" male condom.

Chicken Pox (Varicella). Influenza (Seasonal Flu). Hepatitis A. Hepatitis B. Haemophilus influenza Type B (Hib). Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Measles/Mumps/Rubella. Meningococcal. Pertussis (whooping cough). Polio. Shingles. Pneumococcal. Tetanus/Diphtheria.Your health care provider (HCP) can help you decide which vaccines to receive. Read more about vaccines in the Immunization Schedules for Adults.Vaccines are medical preparations given to help the body boost its immune system or to fight disease. Vaccines can prevent disease and save lives. Some diseases are rare in the U.S. as a result of safe vaccines that work. In the 19th and early 20th century illnesses such as whooping cough (pertussis), measles, mumps and German measles struck hundreds of thousands of people in the United States, mostly children. Tens of thousands of people died.www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn88 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsAre vaccines safe? Vaccines are some of the safest medical products. Before approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), vaccines are tested many times by scientists. Their goal is to ensure that vaccines are effective and safe. Vaccines are the best defense we have against diseases; however, no vaccine is 100% safe or effective for everyone. People don't react to vaccines the same way. Talk to your health care provider (HCP) about vaccines. Talk about any possible side effects. Vaccines are held to the highest standard of safety. The benefits of getting a vaccine far outweigh the risks. In the U.S.: Vaccine supplies are the safest, most effective in history. Vaccines are tracked for safety and effectiveness. Vaccines are tested over and over. Vaccine makers use strict production standards. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and three federal agencies work on vaccine safety: l Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). l National Institutes of Health (NIH). l Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Scientists from FDA and CDC work closely to track reports of vaccine side effects (adverse events). The Veterans Health Administration tracks side effects in its facilities as well. A Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) is given to those who get a vaccine. It: l Explains vaccine benefits and risks. l Is handed out before each dose of certain vaccines. l Is available in Spanish and other languages at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/index.html.Are vaccines effective? Most childhood vaccines build immunity about 90 - 100% of the time. None are perfect. Each vaccine has its own degree of effectiveness. History shows that disease drops when a new vaccine released. Vaccines work best when most members of a community get it- the more people vaccinated, the lower the risk of exposure to disease. How do vaccines work with your immune system? When germs, such as bacteria or viruses, invade the body, they attack and multiply. This is called an infection. Infection can cause illness and disease. Vaccines help your body's immune system (natural defenses) prepare to fight germs and infection. When vaccinated, your immune system attacks the harmless vaccine and prepares for future infections. When the infection comes along, your body will quickly know how to stop it. You may never feel sick. Or you may have a milder illness than you would have if you hadn't been vaccinated. Vaccines are the most effective tool we have to prevent some diseases. Immunity is when your body can avoid infection or disease. Veterans Health Administration89 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsImage Source: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at: www.vaccines.gov A community in which no one is immunized and an outbreak occurs.Some are immunized but not enough for herd immunity. Herd immunity - enough people are immunized, protecting most in the community.How do vaccines protect you and your community? Vaccines can prevent disease and save lives. If enough people get vaccinated, large outbreaks of disease can be avoided. This is known as \"community\" or \"herd\" im- munity. Herd immunity helps protect people who can-not be vaccinated. These include infants and people with certain types of weakened immune systems. Herd immunity is found for many conditions, such as: Influenza. Measles. Mumps. Rotavirus (stomach and intestinal). Pneumococcal disease. Pertussis (whooping cough). Polio. Rubella (German measles). Your HCP should have a record of all the vaccines have been given. You should also keep a record.www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn90 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing Infections Learn more: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Key Facts about Seasonal Flu Vaccine www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm Vaccines & Preventable Diseases http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/vaccines-list.htm Vaccines and Immunizations Safety http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/safety/default.htm Immunization Schedules http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html Immunizations for Infants and Toddlers www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/infants-toddlers.html Pregnant Women and Vaccines http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec-vac/pregnant.html U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): Preventing Seasonal Flu with Vaccinationhttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/index.htm Vaccines, Who & When: Adults www.vaccines.gov/who_and_when/adults/index.html U.S. National Library of Medicine: Medline Plus - Vaccines (immunizations) - overviewhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002024.htm Department of Veterans Affairs (VA): Public Health: Vaccines and Immunizationhttp://www.publichealth.va.gov/vaccines.asp Veterans Health Administration91 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing Infections What are the signs of illness from food? Diarrhea. Fever. Vomiting. Abdominal cramps. Dehydration. How is food handled safely? Be smart when buying groceries (see section on next page). Keep hands, surfaces, and foods clean. Store foods in the right containers. Store foods at the right temperature. Thaw and prepare frozen foods as recommended. Follow specific preparation techniques. Recognize serving principles. Use good judgement when eating out. Tips for the outdoorsman: Field dress, butcher, and store wild game using clean processes. Learn to how to safely select, clean, and store fish and shell fish. Select and clean wild produce with care. Discard any damaged or insect infested fruits, vegetables or game.Food & Water Safety The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 out of every 6 (about 48 million) Americans will suffer a foodborne illness during any given year. Thousands of those made sick by germs in food will need hospitalization and die.www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn92 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsWhen buying groceries: Visit the refrigerated or frozen section last. Keep raw meat, poultry, fish and shellfish separate from fruits and vegetables while shopping. Keep raw foods separate from ready-to-eat foods. Do not buy food if the package is torn, damaged or leaking. Do not buy foods after the \"Sell-By\" or \"Use-By\" dates. Use insulated coolers if traveling or delaying your trip home. When hunting and gathering: Do not gather, handle or eat wild game that seems ill or abnormal. Do not take any part of their body, including antlers. Wash hands and wear gloves while cleaning wild game. Do not eat or drink while gathering or cleaning game. Discard the entire carcass if the chest or abdomen is abnormal. Quickly take out intestines to prevent leakage. Game meat with leakage should be cut away. Meat touched by leakage should not be eaten by people or pets. The American Veterinary Association provides information for hunters at: https://www.avma.org/public/Health/Pages/Disease-Precautions-for- Hunters.aspx#protecting.Clean hands, surfaces, and foods Keep hands clean. Wash hands using hot soapy water after contact with raw meat, poultry, seafood, or unwashed fruits or vegetables. Wash hands before and after handling food. Clean hands after using the bathroom, changing diapers, or handling pets. Use separate cutting boards and knives for meats and vegetables. This avoids the spread of germs. Keep cutting boards, dishes, counters, utensils, and hands clean. Clean cutting boards and work surfaces with warm soapy water (with one tablespoon of bleach added). Wash fruits and vegetables before eating. For more information on cleaning hands see Clean Hands on page 99. Check the temperature of your refrigerator and freezer with an appliance thermometer. The refrigerator should be at 40 \u00b0F or below and the freezer at 0 \u00b0F or below. You can't see, smell, or taste harmful bacteria that may cause illness.Veterans Health Administration93 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing Infections When storing foods you should: Refrigerate perishable food within two hours (one hour when above 90\u00b0F). Store meats on the bottom shelves to avoid dripping on other foods. Keep meat in the original package and wrap with foil or plastic wrap before freezing. Remember: freezing meat does not always protect against disease. Cook beef, veal, lamb, or pork within three to five days. Cook or freeze fresh poultry, fish, ground meats, and other meats within two days. Store cans in a cool, clean, dry place. Discard dented, leaking, bulging, or rusted cans. Do not store food beyond expiration dates. For hunters and gatherers: Promptly freeze, preserve, refrigerate or properly dispose of uncooked game. Keep uncooked wild game separate from cooked or ready-to-eat foods to avoid the spread of germs. The Food and Safety Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture has recommendations and information on refrigerator and freezer food storage. Visit: www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/basics_for_ handling_food_safely/.When thawing food: Thaw in the refrigerator. l Make sure thawing meat and poultry are covered. l Keep juices from dripping into or touching other food. l Refrigerator-thawed meat and poultry may be refrozen before or after cooking. Use cold water for quick thawing if needed. l Place food in a leak-proof plastic bag. l Submerge in cold tap water. l Change the water every 30 minutes. l Cook right away. Use a microwave to thaw as needed. l Cook food right away. Always cook any wild game until juices are clear - follow cooking directions on all packaged meat and poultry. The Danger Zone is the temperature that germs can grow in food. Keep food below 40\u00b0 or above 140\u00b0F (4\u00b0 and 60\u00b0C).140160180200www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn94 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsCategory Food Temperature (\u00b0F) Rest Time Ground Meat & Meat MixturesBeef, Pork, Veal & Lamb 160 None Turkey & Chicken 165 None Fresh Beef, Veal & Lamb Steaks, Roasts & Chops 145 3 Minutes PoultryChicken & Turkey (whole) 165 None Poultry Breasts & Roasts 165 None Poultry thighs, Legs & Wings 165 None Duck & Goose 165 None Stuffing (cooked alone or in bird) 165 None Pork & HamFresh Pork 145 3 Minutes Fresh Ham (raw) 145 3 Minutes Precooked Ham (to reheat) 140 None Egg & Egg DishesEggsCook until yolk & white are firm.None Egg Dishes 160 None Leftovers & CasserolesLeftovers 165 None Casseroles 165 None SeafoodFin Fish145 or cook until flesh is opaque & separates easily with a fork.None Shrimp, Lobster & CrabsCook until flesh is pearly & opaque.None Clams, Oysters & MusselsCook until shells open during cooking.None ScallopsCook until flesh is milky white or opaque & firm.NoneTable 1: Safe Minimum Cooking Temperatures * Table from: Safe Minimum Cooking Temperatures, www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/mintemp.html Veterans Health Administration95 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing InfectionsWhen preparing food: Clean your hands before and after. l Keep cutting boards, utensils, and countertops clean. Use hot, soapy water and mix with liquid chlorine bleach (1 tablespoon per 1 gallon of water). l Separate raw meat, poultry, and seafood from ready-to-eat foods. l Use at least two cutting boards. l One for raw meat, poultry, and seafood. l One for fresh fruits and vegetables. l Don't let \"juice\" from foods and packaging touch other foods, utensils, or surfaces. Use a clean plate or bowl for cooked food. Never use the same plate or bowl that held the uncooked or raw food. Germs from the raw food could get into the cooked food. Marinate meat and poultry in a covered dish in the refrigerator. When using a thermometer: Use a food thermometer to check that meat, poultry, and egg dishes reach a safe temperature. Refer to the chart in Table 1 or visit: www.fsis.usda.gov/Is_It_ Done_Yet/Brochure_Text/index.asp#SMIT. Follow the instructions for your food thermometer. Place thermometer in the thickest part of the food, not touching bone, fat, or gristle. Check at the end of the cooking time, but before the food is expected to be \"done\". Check the temperature in several places to make sure the food is evenly heated. Clean your food thermometer with hot, soapy water before and after each use. Large-dial oven-safe or oven-probe thermometers may be used during cooking. After cooking, allow food to \"rest\" before cutting or eating. \"Rest\" times are in Table 1. During the rest time, the temperature of the food will stay the same or rise. This will help destroy harmful germs. When serving foods: Keep hot food at 140\u00b0F or warmer. Keep cold food at 40\u00b0F or colder. Keep food hot with chafing dishes, slow cookers, and warming trays during parties. Keep food cold by nesting dishes in bowls of ice or use small serving trays. Replace them often. Don't leave perishable foods out for more than 2 hours at room temperature (1 hour when the temperature is above 90\u00b0F). When eating out: Choose a clean restaurant. Look for health department reports online or posted in the restaurant. Look around you before you sit down. If it's not clean think about eating somewhere else. Clean your hands with soap and warm water before eating. If soap and water aren't available, use alcohol hand rub to clean your hands. Pay close attention to the type of food and how it's prepared - harmful germs can be hidden in some foods. Request that your food be cooked completely through - especially meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. Make sure your hot food is piping hot and completely cooked. If lukewarm, send it back. Leftover food should be used within 4 days. Reheat leftovers to 165 \u00b0F. 2 Hour Rule: Keep hot food hot and cold food cold. If food that has been left out is not eaten within 2 hours, discard it.www.publichealth.va.gov/InfectionDontPassItOn96 Men's Health: A Guide to Preventing Infections Know that raw or undercooked finfish or shellfish (including oysters, clams, and mussels) are more likely to contain parasites or bacteria than foods made from cooked fish. Refrigerate take-out and \"leftover\" food within 2 hours after being served. If you will not be home within 2 hours, don't take the leftovers home with you. Bring take-out and \"leftover\" food directly home after eating out and put your leftovers in the refrigerator as soon as you arrive. Eat delivery food within two hours after it arrives. This prevents the growth of harmful germs. If the food is not going to be eaten within two hours, you can keep it hot in the oven\u2014but the temperature must be set at or above 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C). Side dishes, like stuffing, must also be kept hot in the oven. Covering food will help keep it moist while you keep it warm. Check with a food thermometer to make sure that the inside of the food is held at a temperature 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C).Water Safety The U.S. has one of the safest water systems in the world. The quality and safety of tap water can vary based on the water source. Water at your home or work may come from a private well or spring, or community system. The Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion (CDC) receive reports of illnesses related to drink - ing water such as: Chemicals and minerals (arsenic). Viruses. Bacteria. Parasites. Pesticide use. Industrial waster. Water sources can also be made unusable by a failed septic system or from natural or man-made disasters. All U.S. public water systems follow the standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). All water requires regular testing and disinfection. The EPA does not oversee private wells or springs. Owners using these should test their own water from time to time. Check with your local public/water works office or local health department to learn more about water testing such as: What to test for. Where to send tests. How often to test. What to do if your water is contaminated. Reasons to test your water: ongoing \"stomach\" problems, nausea, diarrhea. old pipes that might be lead or are corroded. water that smells or tastes odd, \"smells like gasoline\". water that is cloudy, frothy, or colored.
