Simply put, when your nervous system is damaged or pressured by an imbalance of your skeletal system, painful conditions will arise. When your skeletal system and spine are in alignment, and your nervous system is communicating optimally, without interference or impediment, the conditions and ailments that cause you pain will subside. Chiropractic is a system of complementary medicine based on the diagnosis and manipulative treatment of misalignments of the joints, especially those of the spinal column, which are held to cause other disorders by affecting the nerves, muscles, and organs. WHAT IS A CHIROPRACTOR? A chiropractor is a licensed medical doctor that focuses on disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the nervous system, placing an emphasis on manual adjustment of the spine as a treatment for neuromusculoskeletal conditions, including but not limited to back pain, neck pain, pain in the joints of the arms or legs, and headaches.
