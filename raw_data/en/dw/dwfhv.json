Thankfully, there are also a plethora of aromatherapy solutions to stop them in their tracks, and here are some essential oil blends to help you during cold and flu season. Boost Immunity Shorter days and longer nights mean a reduction in sunlight - resulting in a lack of vitamin D. The consequence of this is an immune system more vulnerable to infection. The Fix - Diffuse six drops of [Lemon Essential Oil](https://www.tisserand.com/aromatherapy/lemon-organic-pure-essential-oil-9ml/) - Citrus limonum every day. This will help to boost the body's immune system and stimulate the production of white blood cells - thereby increasing your ability to fight off illness. Germ Repellent Viruses transmit faster in the cold as lower temperatures make their lipid coating tougher and in turn, more resilient and active. Cold air also contains less water vapour than hot air making it drier. Therefore, when we cough and sneeze, the particles released remain in the air for longer, and as a result, it is more likely for us to catch the cold virus. The Fix - Eucalyptus, Lemon and Tea Tree essential oils. Before going to bed, add 2 drops of [Eucalyptus](https://www.tisserand.com/essential-oils/eucalyptus-essential-oil/), 2 drops of [Lemon](https://www.tisserand.com/essential-oils/lemon-essential-oil/) and 2 drops of [Tea Tree](https://www.tisserand.com/essential-oils/tea-tree-essential-oil/) to the water in your Aroma Spa Diffuser. The antiviral and decongestant properties of Eucalyptus - Eucalyptus globulus, and the antibacterial properties of Tea Tree - Melaleuca alternifolia will help clear your sinuses and fight off germs, while Lemon -Citrus limonum helps boost your immune system. Bronchitis-busting blend When your cold or flu spreads from your nose and throat to your windpipe and airways, you've contracted acute bronchitis. Although not as serious as it sounds, it usually lasts between 2 weeks to a month and goes away on its own. The Fix - [Tea Tree](https://www.tisserand.com/aromatherapy/tea-tree-organic-pure-essential-oil-9ml/) - Melaleuca alternifolia, Citrus aurantium bergamia essential oils: Add 1 drop of each into a bowl of steaming hot water, and inhale with a towel over your head 2/3 times a day, to help eliminate mucus and fight the infection.
