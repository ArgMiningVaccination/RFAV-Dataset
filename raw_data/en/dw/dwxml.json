You will learn what you need to heal your digestion and for as long as you apply those principles, your digestion will continue to improve. Keep in mind that it took a long time to get your digestion where it is now. In Agni Therapy you begin to unravel those patterns and replace them with diet and lifestyle practices that point you in the direction of healing. Keep doing the practices and healing will continue to take place. Do you have people who have completed this program with success? Yes, many. See these [ case studies and testimonials](https://halepuleoffers.com/agni-therapy-testimonials) from my digestive health masterclass. I have (insert condition/diagnosis). Will Agni Therapy work for me? There are a growing number of named conditions and diagnoses these days. Ayurveda is a holistic approach that brings balance to the root cause of these problems by balancing the doshas, caring for agni and clearing ama/metabolic toxins. The exceptions would be if you are currently undergoing chemotherapy or have type one diabetes, we recommend you have a consultation so we can tailor areas of the program to you. If you are still unsure whether Agni Therapy will be supportive to you then be in touch with us - info@halepule.com When can I expect to see and feel the results? While each person is unique, we've noticed clients experience results almost immediately. The body has many indicators and is communicating with us all the time. You're likely to see changes on your tongue in two or three days. The brightness in your skin and eyes will increase in one week. If you are carrying extra weight, that will begin to come off when you follow the eating guidelines in week three. How do I follow the program and still cook for my family? We recommend people ask their family to be supportive of them doing the program. Explain to your loved ones why you want to do it, and how it will make you feel. Sometimes we think our family will be one way and we don't give them a chance to show up for us. Logistically your family can share many of the same meals as you are having. There may be some elements that they do differently to you if they choose to add things, but the basis of the meal can be the same. Can I do Agni Therapy if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding? We do not recommend the Digestive Reset in week 3 of the program. What is most important during this time is nourishing yourself and the baby. You will be able to do most of the practices and meal adjustments in all other weeks. As Agni Therapy is a program, where once you are enrolled you are a member for life, you can return at a later time for the Digestive Reset. Is this program for me if I have trouble seeing things to completion? Yes. The practices and lifestyle guidance provided will help you calm and balance that aspects of yourself that keep you from finishing things. Are there any extra expenses outside of the course cost? There are certain food items that you will cook with daily such as ghee and spices. If you don't already have these, then you will need to purchase them. The feedback we have from those in the program is that food costs decrease significantly in the long run. You might like to get a meditation pillow or a yoga mat if you do not have them. Having a special place to do your practices helps to set the energy and maintain regularity. What if I cannot access some of the ingredients where I live? Most of the fresh ingredients suggested are commonly found in a fresh produce store or at a farmers market. Hale Pule provides a framework so that if you cannot find one item, you can replace it with something else that has similar qualities. If you're unsure of the best thing to replace it with, we'll advise you. If you cannot source certain dried goods in your area, you can order them online and we can recommend a website to do that depending on where you live. Is yoga a component of this program and when should it be done? There are no rules about when to do your practices. We recommend that people do their practices (yoga asana and meditation) first thing in the morning because there are fewer distractions. In the morning you have a fresh mind AND you get to enjoy the benefits of the practices all day long. If another time works better for you, that's great too. How do I continue to apply Agni Therapy to my own life after the program? Think of the program as laying the foundation. Once you are complete you can apply your life to that new foundation. Things in your life may feel different. People experience emotional and energetic shifts that help them to see themselves and their life more clearly. In the community group you have support and advice from many others who have completed the program and integrated it into their own lives. You have ongoing access to the program materials as well as Bonus content specifically designed to support you going forward once the program is complete. I have already done a kitchari cleanse, how is this different? There are many parts to this program that prepare the body and mind to receive nourishment. Kitchari is just one small aspect of the overall program. Kitchari is a simple meal to cook and eat but kitchari alone is just that. In Ayurveda we say \"for whom and when\". The state of digestion is what determines the effect that the food has on our bodies and state of mind. I have already studied Ayurveda, how is this different? Agni Therapy is designed for you to incorporate many of the tools of Ayurveda and Yoga into your life at home. It is the first time we have offered guided videos for practices and a robust archive of recorded Q&As with Myra Lewin, checking in and supporting you as you go. Some things in Agni Therapy you may be familiar with. Remember that Ayurveda is not something we know, it is something we do. If you are not consistently practicing the tools of Ayurveda in your everyday life, you will be sure to benefit from Agni Therapy. Is there a set eating plan? Week one is an introduction and orientation. We also provide recipes and guidance on how to begin shifting your meals and dinacharya. Weeks two - four there is a set eating plan with simple recipes that are easy to follow. Within that framework, you can do what works for you using ingredients that are local to you and cooking cuisines that you enjoy eating. I don't use ghee. Will this still work for me? For those who prefer not to have ghee for personal reasons, you could swap the ghee out for another oil such as olive oil if you are in a cool climate, sesame oil, sunflower oil or coconut oil if you are in a hot tropical climate. When butter becomes ghee, it goes through a transformation process where the milk solids are removed. People that may have had problems with lactose or dairy, do not have any issues with ghee and thrive using it as ghee supports their digestion. Understand that all of these oils do not have the same supportive properties as ghee and they do challenge digestion somewhat. Can this be accessed without the internet? No. You will need the internet to access the program content, the community feed, and any special events. All of which is published on Mighty Networks. You will also need internet to be able to download the supportive written content. Do I need to be on Facebook to do Agni Therapy? No, this program is hosted on Mighty Networks; a safe and private platform free of distractions and advertisements where you can still enjoy all the benefits of connecting with a growing community. Is this an introduction to one of your other courses? In a way, yes. For all students who work with us, whether to be an Ayurvedic Health Advisor or Health Counselor, Ayurvedic chef, Yoga teacher or treatment therapist, we ask that you apply and integrate the principles first to yourself. Would you recommend Home Panchakarma before or after the program? Panchakarma at Home is a very deep process. Doing Agni Therapy prior to panchakarma is an excellent thing to do to prepare the body to receive the most from panchakarma. Once complete you can apply the principles of Agni Therapy. The two endeavors are complementary. How does this program fit to different doshas? How do we know what is best for our unique constitution? The recipes provided are tri-doshic and designed to balance excess in all of the three doshas. During the program you will learn to plan and enjoy meals that work for anyone because all ingredients are enjoyed in moderation. There is a good deal of information about the doshas in the program to help you understand your tendencies and imbalances. "}
