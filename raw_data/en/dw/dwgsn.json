On exploring BCG-alternative therapies, Mycolicibacterium brumae, a nontuberculous mycobacterium, has shown outstanding anti-tumor and immunomodulatory capabilities. As no infections due to M. brumae in humans, animals, or plants have been described, the safety and/or toxicity of this mycobacterium have not been previously addressed. In the present study, an analysis was made of M. brumae- and BCG-intravenously-infected severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, M. brumae-intravesically-treated BALB/c mice, and intrahemacoelic-infected-Galleria mellonella larvae. Organs from infected mice and the hemolymph from larvae were processed to count bacterial burden. Blood samples from mice were also taken, and a wide range of hematological and biochemical parameters were analyzed. Finally, histopathological alterations in mouse tissues were evaluated. Our results demonstrate the safety and non-toxic profile of M. brumae. Differences were observed in the biochemical, hematological and histopathological analysis between M. brumae and BCG-infected mice, as well as survival curves rates and colony forming units (CFU) counts in both animal models. M. brumae constitutes a safe therapeutic biological agent, overcoming the safety and toxicity disadvantages presented by BCG in both mice and G. mellonella animal models.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-04-25", "cleaned_text": "approximately 549,393 newly diagnosed cases and 199,922 deaths from bladder cancer were reported worldwide [ [2](#B2-vaccines-08-00198)]. Most BC cases are diagnosed when patients present with macroscopic hematuria, and confirmed after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) [ [3](#B3-vaccines-08-00198)]. In approximately 75% of BC patients, the disease is localized in the mucosa layer (Ta or carcinoma in situ [CIS]) or submucosa layer (T1) [ [1](#B1-vaccines-08-00198), [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00198)]. In Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) are still the gold standard treatment to avoid recurrence and progression of the disease [ [3](#B3-vaccines-08-00198), [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00198)]. [6](#B6-vaccines-08-00198), [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00198)]. In the mid-1970s, Morales and his colleagues reported the efficacy of BCG in the control of recurrence and progression of NMIBC [ [8](#B8-vaccines-08-00198)], and after several clinical trials, BCG was finally approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (in 1990) for the treatment of NMIBC [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00198), [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00198), [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00198)]. The mechanism of action of BCG, as well as the best practice management, is still not completely understood. Nevertheless, the data support that the anti-tumor effects of BCG are due to an inhibition of tumor proliferation through infection of urothelial cells, a powerful local immune response involving the activity of neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells, as well as the release of different cytokines such as Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-8, resection of the tumor, there must be a delay of around two weeks before patients can proceed to IB BCG instillations, in order to avoid the systemic dissemination of the bacilli through the wound. Nevertheless, the high number of instillations during the induction and maintenance treatment (up to three years) assume a risk of infection whenever traumatic instillation occurs. [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00198), [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00198), [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00198), [21](#B21-vaccines-08-00198)]. The majority of these strategies consider the use of heat-killed or -irradiated mycobacteria, or fractions of mycobacteria cells. However, different studies have highlighted the importance of the use of live mycobacteria (at least at the first instillation) to achieve an adequate response against bladder tumors [ [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00198), [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00198)]. An interesting option to substituting BCG could be the use of non-infectious mycobacteria. Studies from our laboratory using this alternative demonstrated the anti-tumor and immunostimulatory a rapid growth rate in vitro. M. brumae inhibits BC cell proliferation in vitro, triggers a cytotoxic profile in stimulated peripheral mononuclear blood cells against BC cells ex vivo, and increases survival of tumor-bearing mice by triggering both an IB and a systemic immune response that leads to tumor clearance [ [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00198), [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00198), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00198)]. [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00198), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00198)]. Moreover, no colony forming units (CFU) have been isolated in tumor-bearing mice treated intravesically with M. brumae, suggesting the lack of pathogenicity of this species. However, no safety or toxicity studies have been undertaken. In this study, immunosuppressed and immunocompetent mice, after intravenous (IV) and IB administration, as well as the Galleria mellonella model, were used to assess the safety and potential toxicity of live and -irradiated M. brumae. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Bacterial Cultures [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00198)] in order to get the required concentration for each treatment. To confirm the dose of each experiment, representative bacterial suspensions of each treatment were serially diluted in PBS, and CFU were counted after plating on Middlebrook 7H10 medium as previously described [ [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00198)]. Irradiation of M. brumae for intravenous infection and intravesical treatment was performed at Aragogamma S.L. as previously described [ [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00198)]. 2.2. Intravenous (IV) and Intravesical (IB) Mice Treatments [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00198), [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00198)]. Mice were IV treated via the lateral tail vein with a dose of 2 \u00d7 106 mycobacteria CFU of live M. brumae, -irradiated M. brumae, or live BCG in 0.1 mL of PBS, or 0.1 mL of PBS as a control. At 15 weeks, the surviving mice were sacrificed by exsanguination under terminal inhalation anesthesia for a complete systematic necropsy and histopathology assessment. Collected blood was processed for biochemistry and hematology parameters, and the main mycobacteria-target organs (liver, lung and spleen) were removed for quantitation of CFU and/or histopathology analysis (schedule is shown in [Figure 1](#vaccines-08-00198-f001)A). [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00198), [30](#B30-vaccines-08-00198)]. A dose of 2 \u00d7 106 CFU/mouse (low dose) or 2 \u00d7 109 CFU (high dose) of live or -irradiated M. brumae in 0.1 mL PBS, or PBS alone for control group, was administered through IB instillations (dwell time 60 minutes) [ [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00198)]. Animals were treated weekly for 6 weeks ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-08-00198-f001)B), and were euthanized two weeks after the last treatment. A complete systematic necropsy was undertaken. Lung, spleen, liver, and kidney were aseptically removed to quantify CFU. Urinary bladders were also preserved histopathology mellonella Infection Model [Figure 1](#vaccines-08-00198-f001)C). 2.4. Mycobacteria CFU Counting in Different Organs from Mice and G. mellonella Hemolymph 2.5. Determination of Biochemical and Hematological Parameters 2.6. Histopathological Analysis in Mouse Organs 2.7. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. M. brumae-Treated Animals Showed 100% Survival Rates after Treatments [Figure 2](#vaccines-08-00198-f002)A. Mice infected with live M. brumae showed a statistically significant body weight increase compared to PBS-treated mice from week 8 after infection to almost the end of the study ( [Figure S1A](#app1-vaccines-08-00198)). At day 84, for instance, live M. brumae-infected mice showed an increase of percentage weight with respect to their initial weight of 40.73 \u00b1 17.75, while PBS treated mice showed an increase of 30.64 \u00b1 8.70 (p < 0.05). On the other hand, BCG-infected mice started losing weight ( [Supplementary Figure S1A](#app1-vaccines-08-00198)), as well as presenting with clinical signs from the fourth week after infection. Humane endpoints were applied in all mice from the BCG group between 48-55 days after infection ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-08-00198-f002)A). [Supplemental Figure S1B](#app1-vaccines-08-00198)). All animals showed an increase in body weight at the end of the experiment, compared to those recorded at the beginning of the experiment, with no differences between M. brumae-treated groups and the PBS-treated group ( [Figure S1](#app1-vaccines-08-00198)). All animals survived until of the experiment ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-08-00198-f002)B). [Figure 2](#vaccines-08-00198-f002)C, *** p < 0.0005; **** p < 0.0001). At the highest mycobacteria concentration, survival rates in M. brumae-infected larvae reached 100%, while in BCG-infected larvae it decreased by up to 43%. 3.2. No CFU Were Recovered from M. brumae-Treated Animals at the End of the Experiments [Figure 3](#vaccines-08-00198-f003)A-C). Both lungs and spleens from IV BCG-infected mice showed weight differences compared to IV PBS-treated mice (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in the weights of livers between IV-treated groups ( [Figure S1C](#app1-vaccines-08-00198)). With regards to the organs from IB-treated mice, no M. brumae CFU were detected, and no differences were observed in the weights of any organ in any experimental group ( [Figure S2](#app1-vaccines-08-00198)). Finally, no CFU were observed in hemolymph cultures from 104, 105, or 106 M. brumae-infected G. mellonella larvae 144 hours after infection. In contrast, up to 103-104 CFU/mL were obtained in hemolymph cultures 3](#vaccines-08-00198-f003)D). 3.3. Treatments Did not Alter Biochemical and Hematology Parameters Compared to Control Mice [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00198-t001)). Similarly, differences in hematology parameters were only found in IV BCG-infected mice. WBC counts were increased in IV BCG-infected mice, with neutrophils and lymphocytes the cells showing the highest increases, followed by basophils, and lastly, monocytes and eosinophils ( [Table 2](#vaccines-08-00198-t002)). No differences were observed between M. brumae-infected groups and control mice in biochemical or hematology analyses. 3.4. Histopathology Analysis Reveals the Safety and Lack of Toxicity of M. brumae Treatments in Mice [Figure 4](#vaccines-08-00198-f004)A. Lesions were described as coalescent granulomas of parenchymal distribution with an inflammatory component composed of macrophages, epithelioid cells, and to a lesser extent, neutrophils. Statistically significant differences were seen in the stomach, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, kidneys, adrenal glands, heart, bone marrow, spleen, lungs, salivary glands, and encephalon between the BCG-treated group and the other groups (live M. brumae, -irradiated M. brumae and PBS) ( observed trachea, thymus, nerve, skin, muscle, and aorta-cava between groups. Some animals from both M. brumae-infected and PBS groups showed epicardial mineralization with clinical relevance ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-08-00198-f004)B). [Figure 5](#vaccines-08-00198-f005)). Although no significant differences were observed between groups, the high dose of -irradiated M. brumae group was the condition with the highest inflammatory score followed by the high dose of live M. brumae group. On the contrary, the group with the lowest inflammatory score was the -irradiated M. brumae low dose group. Only one animal achieved a histology score of 4, showing chronic cystitis that also affected the muscular layer ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-08-00198-f005)), which can be associated with repeated intravesical administrations. 4. Discussion [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00198)]. These cases of infection occur mainly in immunocompromised hosts, but can also be produced in immunocompetent hosts. The extraordinary immunomodulatory potential of mycobacteria led to some of these non-tuberculous species being used for the treatment of infectious diseases and cancers. Among them, M. brumae has been described as a potential immunotherapeutic agent for NMIBC treatment. M. brumae shares the anti-tumor ability of BCG, as well as its capacity to trigger an immune response during intravesical instillations [ [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00198), [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00198), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00198), [32](#B32-vaccines-08-00198)]. In contrast no CFU have been isolated in M. brumae-treated tumor bearing mice [ [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00198), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00198)], but a systematic safety and toxicity study on M. brumae needs to be performed. [33](#B33-vaccines-08-00198), [34](#B34-vaccines-08-00198), [35](#B35-vaccines-08-00198), [36](#B36-vaccines-08-00198), [37](#B37-vaccines-08-00198)], mice infected with BCG did not reach the endpoint of the study (105 days). Animals of the BCG group presented with clinical and pathological findings compatible with a severe systemic and multi-organ infection. [38](#B38-vaccines-08-00198)], and increasing the production of AST and ALT (enzyme indicators of liver injury) [ [39](#B39-vaccines-08-00198), [40](#B40-vaccines-08-00198)], as we found in our experiments ( [Figure and [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00198-t001)). Histopathology analysis of revealed the presence of granulomas ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-08-00198-f004)A). Our results are in agreement with other studies using the same BCG sub-strain (Connaught), showing granulomas in all three abovementioned organs [ [41](#B41-vaccines-08-00198)]. Some other studies in which SCID mice were intravenously infected with the BCG Pasteur sub-strain described the formation of granulomas only in liver and spleen, but not in lungs, attributing this fact to a characteristic deficiency of CD4+ T-cell-mediated immunity in this immunodeficient mouse model [ [42](#B42-vaccines-08-00198)]. [43](#B43-vaccines-08-00198), [44](#B44-vaccines-08-00198)], might explain a higher potassium level in blood. In addition, high and low values of urea and creatinine, respectively, together with the observed kidney lesions might be attributable to kidney failure. As expected, low blood glucose and iron levels were found in BCG-infected animals, all of which showed clinical signs of systemic illness. Furthermore, as commonly seen in mycobacterial infections, iron levels may also decrease due to different strategies by mycobacteria to remove iron from the host [ [45](#B45-vaccines-08-00198), [46](#B46-vaccines-08-00198)]. Likewise, the hematology parameters indicated an inflammatory response due to the BCG infection, with increased WBC and RBC, which was absent in mice infected with live and -irradiated M. brumae. The total neutrophil count in BCG-treated mice suggested a classic neutrophilia typical of the advanced stages of tuberculosis, which could act as a Trojan horse harboring bacilli and promoting then the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the SCID mice [ [47](#B47-vaccines-08-00198), [48](#B48-vaccines-08-00198)]. [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00198), [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00198), [50](#B50-vaccines-08-00198)]. Clinical symptoms started by day 33 of the study and progressed until euthanasia was used as a humane endpoint. [51](#B51-vaccines-08-00198)].The pathogenicity of different mycobacteria species could be reflected in the survival rates of G. mellonella after infection [ [52](#B52-vaccines-08-00198)]. Survival of larvae and CFU counts in hemolymph demonstrated that M. brumae is eliminated from the organism within 144 hours after infection, while BCG survives inside the larvae, additionally decreasing larval survival rates. Therefore, this animal model also corroborates the safety of M. brumae infection. [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00198), [53](#B53-vaccines-08-00198)]. We have previously demonstrated that after the first instillation in an orthotopic murine model using live M. brumae, further sequential instillations using -irradiated M. brumae maintain a statistically significant survival rate compared to non-treated tumor-bearing mice, although there are no statistically significant differences between survival rates of live-M. brumae-treated tumor-bearing mice and -irradiated M. brumae-treated mice [ [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00198)]. For this reason, we considered it relevant to study the toxicity of live and -irradiated M. brumae. The high dose used in the present study, and the length of the treatment (6 weeks) corresponds to the usual administration in NMIBC patients in order to avoid recurrences and progression of the disease. The absence of clinical signs and bacterial burden in mice and in the processed organs also corroborate the safety and non-toxicity of M. brumae after IB instillation.
