recognized severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Despite rapid progress towards understanding the di sease and the transmission of the SARS Co-V, there are still many gaps in our understanding of SARS. It wa s very clear during the SARS outbreak however, that this virus was easily spread through internationa l air travel and close hosp ital contact. In fact health care facilities amplified the dis ease in all severely affected countries. The experience in affected areas showed very clear ly that the transmission of the SARS Co-V can generally be prevented. Because there is no know n effective treatment and no available vaccine, health authorities had to resort to basic public health measures . Rapid case detection, immediate isolation, contact tracing and good in fection control precautions are critical in th e prevention of infection. However, as SARS spread, it became obvious that many countries lacked the necessary infrastructure, facilities, equipment and trained pe rsonnel to provide appropria te precautions. Health care facilities in both developed an d developing countries we re far from prepared to deal with such a disease. It is essential that all countries stre ngthen their regional and national surveillance and response systems and their infection control capacities , in particular hospital- based infection control departments. In order to support countries to deal with SARS a nd to prevent further spread of infection, the WHO Regional Offices for South-East Asia and the Western Pacific have jointly prepared these guidelines. The guidelines address all aspects of an infec tion control programme and devote considerable attention to SARS. Since inform ation on SARS is still evolving, th ese are interim guidelines. They may need to be updated as and when more specific information becomes available. WHO would greatly appreciate feedback from those who use these guidelines. We hope that these guidelines will be found useful by health professionals at all levels who have to deal with SARS and other hea lth-care-associated infections.

INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND The emergence of life-threatening infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and re-emerging infectious diseases like plague and tuberculosis have highlighted the need for efficient infection control programme s in all health care settings and capacity building for health care workers so they can implement them. An infection control programme puts together various practices which when used appr opriately restrict the spread of infection. A breach in infection control prac tices facilitates transmission of infection from patients to health care workers, other patients and attendants . It is therefore important for all health care workers, patients, their family members, friends and close contacts to adhere to the infection control guidelines strictly. It is also imperative for health ca re administrators to ensure implementation of the infection control programme in health care facilities. Infection control practices \"Standard precautions\" require that health care workers assume that the blood and body substances of all patients are potential sources of inf ection, regardless of the diagnosis, or presumed infectious status. Additional precautions are needed for diseases transmitted by air, droplets and contact. These are termed \"a dditional (transmission-based) precautions\" have replaced previous terms such as univers al blood and body fluid precautions, universal precautions and barrier nursing. While particul ar care needs to be taken in the management of patients/clients known to have active infections it must be remembered that infection will not always be detected and complete safety can lie onl y in following the appropriate level of precautions. Purpose The South-East Asia and Wester n Pacific Regional Offices of the World Health Organization (WHO) have jointly developed these guideline s to provide comprehensive information to health care workers in the prevention and contro l of transmissible infections. These are built on current infection control guidelines, wh ich have recently been developed by WHO.2 They place special emphasis on standard and addi tional (transmission-based) precautions. The guidelines have been prepared specifically to assist infection contro l practitioners in the management and prevention of hospital-associated infections and to ensure that health care administrators understand the signifi cance of infection control programmes. Objectives The general objective of th ese guidelines is to provide admi nistrators and health care workers with the tools to enable them to implement the infection control programme effectively in order to protect themselves and others from the transmission of infections. 1. I NTRODUCTION 2 The specific objectives of these guidelines are to provide directions and information in relation to: Facilities, equipment, and pro cedures necessary to implement standard and additional (transmission-based) precautions for control of infections Cleaning, disinfecting and reproc essing of reusable equipment Waste management Protection of health care worker s from transmissible infections Infection control practices in special settings Use of the guidelines The guidelines are generic in nature and can be used in any health care facility. Countries need to adapt them to suit their needs and cont ext. Health care providers from Member Sates should periodically refer to WHO websites for up -to-date information on infectious diseases and their control.

INFECTION CONTROL PROGRAMME NEED FOR AN INFECTION CONTROL PROGRAMME The responsible health authority should devel op a national (or regional ) programme to support hospitals in reducing the risk of health-care-associated or nosocomia l infections. More information on infection control programmes can be found in the document \"P revention of hospital-acquired infections\" at: http://www.who.int/emc Such a programme must: set relevant national objectives consistent w ith other national hea lth care objectives; develop and continually update guidelines for recommended health care surveillance, prevention, and practice; develop a national system to m onitor selected infections a nd assess the effectiveness of interventions; harmonize initial and continuing training pr ogramme for health care professionals; facilitate access to materials and produc ts essential for hygiene and safety; and encourage health care establishments to m onitor health-care associated (nosocomial) infections and to provide feedback to the professionals concerned. The national or regional health au thority should designate an agen cy to oversee the programme (a ministerial department, institution or other body), a nd plan national activities with the help of a national expert committee. to review risks associated with new technol ogies, and monitor the risk of acquiring an infection from new devices and product s, before their approval for use; to review and provide input into inve stigation of outbreak s and epidemics; to communicate and cooperate with other committe es of the health care facility with common interests such as Pharmacy and Therapeutics or Antimicrobial Use Committee, Biosafety or Health and Safety Committees, and Blood Transfusion Committee. Each health care facility needs to develop an infection control programme to ensure the well being of both patients and staff. Risk prevention for patients and staff is a concern of everyone in the facil ity, and must be supported by the senior administration. An annual work pl an to assess and promote good health care, appropriate isolation, sterilizat ion, and other practices, staff training, and epidemiological surveillance should be developed. He alth care facilities must provide sufficient resources to support this programme. 4. I NFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES 4 WHAT IS AN INFECTION CONTROL PROGRAMME? The important components of the infection control programme are: basic measures for infection control, i.e. standard and additi onal precautions; education and training of health care workers; protection of health care workers, e.g. immunization; identification of hazards and minimizing risks; routine practices essential to infection control such as aseptic techni ques, use of single use devices, reprocessing of instruments and equi pment, antibiotic usage, management of blood/body fluid exposure, handling and use of blood and blood products; effective work practices and procedures, su ch as environmental management practices including management of hospital/clinical wa ste, support services (e .g., food, linen), use of therapeutic devices; surveillance; incident monitoring; outbreak investigation; infection control in specific situations; and research. As well as implementing basic measures for infection control, health care f acilities should prioritize their infection control needs and design their programmes accordingly. ORGANIZATION OF AN INFECTION CONTROL PROGRAMME As with all other functions of a health care facility, the ultimate responsibility for prevention and control of infection rests with the health administ rator. The hospital admini strator/head of hospital should: establish an infection control committee which w ill in turn appoint an infection control team; and provide adequate resources for effective func tioning of the infection control programme. Infection control committee An infection control committee provides a forum for multidisciplinary input and cooperation, and information sharing. This committee should include wide representation from relevant departments: e.g. management, physicians, other health care work ers, clinical microbiol ogy, pharmacy, sterilizing service, maintenance, housekeeping and traini ng services. The committee must have a reporting relationship directly to either administration or th e medical staff to promote programme visibility and effectiveness. 4. I NFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES 5 In an emergency (such as an outbreak), this comm ittee must be able to m eet promptly. It has the following tasks: to review and approve a yearly programme of activity for surveillance and prevention; to review epidemiological surveillance data and identify areas for intervention; to assess and promote improved practice at all levels of the health facility; to ensure appropriate staff tr aining in infection control and safety management, provision of safety materials such as personal protective equipment and products; and training of health workers. The infection control programme will be effective so long as it is comprehensive and includes surveillance and prevention activities, as well as st aff training. There must al so be effective support at national and regional levels. The infection control comm ittee is responsible for the developmen t of policies for the prevention and control of infection and to overs ee the implementation of the infec tion control programme. It should: be composed of representatives of various units within the hospital that have roles to play (medical, nursing, engineering, administrati ve, pharmacy, sterilizing service and microbiology departments); elect one member of the committee as the chairp erson (who should have direct access to the head of the hospital administration); appoint an infection control pr actitioner (health care worker trained in the principles and practices of infection contro l, e.g. a physician, microbiologi st or registered nurse) as secretary; meet regularly (ideally monthly but not less than three times a year); develop its own infection control manual/s; and monitor and evaluate the performance of the infection control programme. Infection control team The infection control team is re sponsible for the day- to-day activities of the infection control programme. Health care establishments must ha ve access to specialists in infection control, epidemiology, and infectious diseas e, including physicians and in fection control practitioners. In some countries, these professionals are spec ialized teams working for a hospital or a group of health care establishments; they may be admini stratively part of anot her unit (e.g. a microbiology laboratory, medical or nursing administ ration, public health services). The optimal structure will vary with the type, needs, and re sources of the facility. The reporting structure must, however , ensure the infection control team has appropriate authority to manage an effective infection control programme. In large facilities, this w ill usually mean a direct reporting relationship with senior administration. The infection c ontrol team or individual is responsible for the day-to-day func tions of infection control, as we ll as preparing the yearly work plan for review by the infection control committee and administration. These teams or individuals have a scientific a nd technical sup port role, e.g. surveillance and research, developing and assessi ng policies and practical supervis ion, evaluation of material and products, the overseeing of sterilization and di sinfection and the implementation of training 4. I NFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES 6 programmes. They should also support and particip ate in research and assessment programmes at the national and international levels. The infection control team should: consist of at least an infec tion control practitioner who shoul d be trained for the purpose; carry out the surveillance programme; develop and disseminate in fection control policies; monitor and manage critical incidents; coordinate and conduct training activities. INFECTION CONTROL MANUAL A hospital-associated infection prevention manual c ontaining instructions a nd practices for patient care is an important tool. The manual should be de veloped and updated by the infection control team and reviewed and approved by the committee. It mu st be made readily available for health care workers, and updated in a timely fashion. EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF HEALTH CARE STAFF Health administrators should be or iented towards the importance of the infection control programme. Health care workers should be equipped with requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes for good infection control practices. The infection control team should: assess training needs of the staff and provi de required training through awareness programmes, in-service educat ion and on-the-job training; organize regular training programmes for the staf f for essential infection control practices that are appropriate to their job description; provide periodic re-training or orientation of staff; and review the impact of training. 7 3. INFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES Infection control practices can be grouped in two categories (1) standard precautions; (2) additional (transmission-based) precautions. Transmission of infections in he alth care facili ties can be prevented and controlled through the application of basic infection control precautions which can be grouped into standard precautions, which must be applied to all patients at all times, regardless of diagnosis or infectious status, and additional (transmission-based) preca utions which are specific to modes of transmission (airborne, droplet and contact). 1,2,3,4,5 STANDARD PRECAUTIONS Treating all patients in the health care facility with the same basi c level of \"standard\" precautions involves work practices that are essential to provide a high level of protection to patients, health care workers and visitors. These include the following: hand washing and antise psis (hand hygiene); use of personal protective equipment when handling blood, body substances, excretions and secretions; appropriate handling of patient care equipment and soiled linen; prevention of needlestick/sharp injuries; environmental cleaning and spills-management; and appropriate handling of waste. Hand washing and antisepsis (hand hygiene) Appropriate hand hygiene can minimize micro-orga nisms acquired on the ha nds during daily duties and when there is contact with blood, body flui ds, secretions, excre tions and known and unknown contaminated equipment or surfaces (for further details see Annex 1). Wash or decontaminate hands: after handling any blood, body fl uids, secretions, excretions and contaminated items; between contact with different patients; between tasks and procedures on the same patie nt to prevent cross contamination between different body sites; immediately after removing gloves; and using a plain soap, antimicrobial agen t or waterless antiseptic agent. The hospital setting is a good setting for communi cation about personal hygiene, such as informing visitors and the general public about hygiene rules such as washing hands. 4. I NFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES 8 Use of personal protective equipment Using personal protective equipment provides a phys ical barrier between micro-organisms and the wearer. It offers protection by help ing to prevent mi croorganisms from: contaminating hands, eyes, clothing, hair and shoes; being transmitted to other patients and staff (f or further information about personal protective equipment see Annex 2). Personal protective equipment includes: gloves; protective and cap/haircover. Gloves Protective eye wear (goggles) Masks Full Personal Protective Equipment Hair cover Eye wear (goggles) Mask Gown Apron Shoe covers Examples of personal protective equipment 4. I NFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES 9 Personal protective equipment should be used by: health care workers who provide direct care to patients and who work in situations where they may have contact with blood, body fluids, excretions or secretions; support staff including medical aides, cleaners, and laundry staff in situations where they may have contact with blood, body fluids , secretions and excretions; laboratory staff, who handle patient specimens; and family members who provide care to patients and are in a situation where they may have contact with blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions. Principles for use of personal protective equipment Personal protective equipment reduces but does not completely eliminate the risk of acquiring an infection. It is important that it is used effectively, correctly, a nd at all times where contact with blood and body fluids of all patients may occur. Continuous availability of personal protective equipment and adequate training for its proper use are essential. Staff must also be aware that use of personal protective equipment does not replace the n eed to follow basic infection control measures such as hand hygiene. The following principles guide the us e of personal protective equipment: Personal protective equipment should be chosen according to the risk of exposure. Health care workers should assess whether they are at risk of exposure to blood, body fluids excretions or secretions and choose their items of personal protective equipment according to this risk. Avoid any contact between contaminated (used) personal protective equipment and surfaces, clothing or people outside the patient care area. Discard used personal protective equipment in appropriate disposal bags, and dispose of according to the health care facility protocol. Do not share personal protective equipment. Change personal protective equipment complete ly and thoroughly wash hands each time you leave a patient to attend to a nother patient or another duty. Gloves Wear gloves (clean, non-sterile) when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions or mucous membranes. Change gloves between contact with different patients. Change gloves between tasks/pr ocedures on the same patient to prevent cross contamination between different body sites. Remove gloves immediately after use and before attending to another patient. It is important to use personal protective equipment effectively, correctly, and at all times where contact with patient's blood, body fluids, excretions and secretions may occur. 4. I NFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES 10 Wash hands immediately after removing gloves. Use a plain soap, antimicrobial agen t or waterless antiseptic agent. Disposable gloves should not be reused but should be disposed of according to the health care facility protocol. Masks Wear a mask to protect mucous membrane s of the mouth and nose when undertaking procedures that are likely to generate splashes of blood, body fluids, secr etions or excretions. Wear surgical masks rather than cotton, material or gauze masks. Surgical masks have been designed to resist fluids to varying degrees depending on the de sign of the material in the mask. Do not reuse disposable masks. They should be disposed of according to the health care facility protocol. Protective eyewear/goggles/visors/face shield Wear protective eyewear/goggles/v isors/face shields to protect the mucous membranes of the eyes when conducting procedures that are likel y to generate splashes of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions. If disposable, di scard appropriately. If they are reusable, decontaminate them according to th e manufacturer's instructions. Gowns and plastic aprons Wear a gown (clean, non-sterile) to protect the skin and prev ent soiling of clothing during procedures that are likely to generate splashes of blood, body fluids secretions or excretions. Impermeable gowns are preferable. Remove a soiled or wet gown as soon as possible. A plastic apron may be worn on top of the gown to protect exposure to blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions. Launder gowns and aprons appropriately if th ey are reusable, according to the hospital guidelines. Do not reuse disposable gowns and aprons. Th ey should be disposed of according to the health care facility protocol. Caps and boots/shoe covers Wear disposable caps and boots where there is a likelihood the patient\u0092s blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions may splash, spill or leak onto the hair or shoes. Do not reuse disposable caps. They should be di scarded according to th e health care facility protocol. Decontaminate reusable boots. Discard boots/shoe covers afte r use according to the health care facility protocol. 4. I NFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES 11 Handling of patient care equipment and soiled linen Patient care equipment Handle patient care equipment so iled with blood, body fluids secr etions or excretions with care in order to prevent exposure to skin and mucus membranes, clothing and the environment. Ensure all reusable equipment is cleaned and reprocessed appropriately before being used on another patient. Linen Handle, transport and process used linen that is soiled with blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions with care to ensure th at there is no leaking of fluid. Prevention of needle stick/sharps injuries Take care to prevent injuries when using need les, scalpels and othe r sharp instruments or equipment. Place used disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades and other sharp items in a puncture-resistant container with a lid that closes and is located close to the area in which the item is used. Take extra care when cleaning sharp re usable instruments or equipment. Never recap or bend needles. Sharps must be appropriately deco ntaminated and/or destroyed as per the national standards or guidelines. Management of health-care waste Uncollected, long stored waste or waste routing within the premises must be avoided. A sound waste management system needs to be developed and cl osely monitored. (For further information see Environmental Management Practices \u0096 chapter 4.) ADDITIONAL (TRANSMISSION-BASED) PRECAUTIONS Additional (transmission-based) precautions are take n while still ensuring standard precautions are maintained. Additional precautions include: airborne precautions; droplet precautions; and contact precautions. Airborne precautions Airborne precautions are designed to reduce the transmission of diseases spread by the airborne route. Airborne transmission occurs when droplet nuclei (evaporated droplets) <5 micron in size are disseminated in the air. 6 These droplet nuclei can remain susp ended in the air for long periods of 4. I NFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES 12 time. Droplet nuclei are the residu als of droplets and when suspe nded in the air, dry and produce particles ranging in size from 1- 5 micron. These particles can remain suspended indefinitely in the air. Diseases which spread by this mode include open/active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), measles, chicken pox, pulmonary plague and haemorrhagic fever with pneumonia. The following precautions need to be taken: Implement standard precautions. Place patient in a single room that has a mon itored negative airflow pressure, and is often referred to as a \"negative pressure room\" (see Glo ssary). The air should be discharged to the outdoors or specially filtered before it is circulated to other ar eas of health care facility. Keep doors closed. Anyone who enters the room must wear a special, high filtrati on, particulate respirator (e.g. N 95) mask. Limit the movement and transport of the patient from the room for essential purposes only. If transport is necessary, minimize dispersal of droplet nuclei by masking the patient. It is important to gain the support of engineering services to ensure the negative airflow pressure is maintained. Droplet precautions Diseases which are transmitted by this route includ e pneumonias, pertussis, diphtheria, influenza type B, mumps, and meningitis. Droplet transmissi on occurs when there is adequate contact between the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth or conjunctivae of a susceptible person and large particle droplets (> 5 microns). 7 Droplets are usually generated from the infected person during coughing, sneezing, talking or when health care work ers undertake procedures such as suctioning.7 The following precautions need to be taken: Implement standard precautions. Place patient in a single room (or in a room with another similarly infected patient). Wear a mask when working within 1-2 meters of the patient. Place a mask on the patient if transport is necessary. Special air handling and ventilati on are not required to prevent dr oplet transmission of infection. Contact precautions Diseases which are transmitted by this route include colonization or infection with multiple antibiotic resistant organisms, enteric infections and skin infections. The following precautions need to be taken: Implement standard precautions. Place patient in a single room (or in a room with another similarly infected patient). Consider the epidemiology of the disease and the pa tient population when determining patient placement. Wear clean, non-sterile gloves when entering the room. Wear a clean, non-sterile gown when entering the r oom if substantial contact with the patient, environmental surfaces or items in the patient\u0092s room is anticipated. 4. I NFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES 13 Limit the movement and transport of the patient from the room; patients should be moved for essential purposes only. If tran sportation is required, use precau tions to minimize the risk of transmission. PATIENT PLACEMENT AND TRAN SPORTATION OF PATIENTS Patient placement Appropriate or selective placemen t of patients is important in preventing the transmission of infections in the hospital setting. General principles in relation to the placement of patients include the following. Spacing between beds In open plan wards there should be adequate spac ing between each bed to reduce the risk of cross contamination/infection occurring from direct or indirect contact or droplet transmission. Optimum spacing between beds is 1-2 meters. Single rooms Single rooms reduce the risk of tr ansmission of infection from th e source patient to others by reducing direct or indirect c ontact transmission. Where possible, single rooms should have the following facilities: hand washing facilities; toilet and bathroom facilities. Anterooms Single rooms used for isolation purposes may include an anteroom to support the use of personal protective equipment. Cohorting For infection control purposes, if single rooms are not available, or if ther e is a shortage of single rooms, patients infected or colonized by the same organism can be cohorted (sharing of room/s). When cohorting is used during outbreaks, these room/s should be in a well-defined area (a designated room or designated ward), which can be clearly segregated from other patient care areas in the healthcare facili ty used for non-infect ed/colonized patients. Transportation of patients Limiting the movement and transport of patients fr om the isolation room/ar ea for essential purposes only will reduce the opportunities for tr ansmission of micro-organisms in other areas of the hospital. If transportation is requir ed, suitable precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of micro-organisms to other patients, health care workers or the hospital environment (surfaces or equipment). For example: when transporting a pa tient with pulmonary tuberculosis (open/active) placing a mask on the patient while in transit is an appropriate precaution. 14 4. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES A clean environment plays an important role in the prevention of hospital-associated infections (HAI). Many factors, including the design of patient care areas, operating rooms, air quality, water supply and the laundry, can significantly influence the transmission of HAI. PREMISES/BUILDINGS Facility design and planning should ensure: adequate safe water supply; appropriate cleaning practices; adequate floor space for beds; adequate interbed space; adequate handwashing facilities; adequate ventilation for isolation rooms and high risk areas like operation theatres, transplant units, intensive care areas, etc; adequate isolation facilities for airborne , droplet, contact isol ation and protective environment; regulation of traffic flow to minimize exposure of high-risk patients a nd facilitate patient transport; measures to prevent exposure of patien ts to fungal spores during renovations; precautions to control rodents, pests and other vectors; and appropriate waste management facilities and practices AIR Ventilation Ventilation systems should be designed and mainta ined to minimize microbial contamination. The air conditioning filters should be cl eaned periodically and fans that can spread airborne pathogens should be avoided in high-risk areas. High-risk areas such as operating rooms, critical care units and transplant units require special ventilation systems. Filtration systems (air handli ng units) designed to provide clean air should have high efficiency particulate air (H EPA) filters in high-risk areas. Unidirectional laminar airflow systems should be available in appropriate areas in the hospital construction. Ultra clean air is valuable in some types of cardiac surgery/neurosurgery/implant surger y theatres and transplant units. 4. E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 15 For the operating room, the critical parameters for air quality include: Frequent maintenance / validation of efficacy of filters (in accordance with manufacturer's requirements); pressure gradient across the filter bed and in the operation theatre; air changes per hour (minimum 15 air changes per hour); temperature should be maintained between 20 \u00b0C and 22 \u00b0C and humidity between 30% and 60% to inhibit bacterial multiplication; general areas should be well ventilate d if they are not air-conditioned. Special air handling for airborne precautions Negative air pressure vented to the air is recommended for contamin ated areas and is required also for isolation of patients with inf ections spread by the airborne route. An air-handling system providing 6-12 air changes per hour with the air being discharged outside through a filtration mechanism is recommended. Systems must be checked by engineering se rvices to ensure they are in fact offering negative pressure rooms. An air-conditioned single room with an exhaust or a well-ventilated room are adequate options for health care facilities without \"neg ative pressure\" rooms. (See also \"Negative pressure room\" in the glossary.) Protective environment A protective environment may be required for some neutropenic patients. U ltra clean unidirectional air may be required in some units such as haem atology or intensive care due to the level of immunosuppression of the patients. To minimize airbor ne particles, air must be circulated into the room with a velocity of at least 0.25m/sec through a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The HEPA filter removes particles to a certain defi ned size. If particles 0.3 microns in diameter are removed, the air entering the room can be cla ssified as being clean and free of bacterial contamination. 2 Other important ways of protecting patients w ith severely lowered immune systems include: Health care workers and visitors should avoi d contact with the pati ent if they have any infections (for example, upper respiratory trac t infections or herpes simplex blisters). Where appropriate, staff and vi sitors should wear personal pr otective equipment to protect the patient from micro-organisms. Do not put flowers in the room. Ensure a tidy environment. Environmental cleaning should be done twice daily and should consist of damp dusting only \u0096 do not create aerosols. Use strict aseptic techniques for all clinical procedures. 4. E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 16 WATER The health care facility should provide safe wate r. If it has water storage tanks, they should be cleaned regularly and the quality of water should be sampled peri odically to check for bacterial contamination. Safe drinking water Where safe water is not available, boil water fo r 5 minutes to render it safe. Alternatively, use water purification units. Store water in hygienic environment. Do not a llow hands to enter the storage container. Dispense water from storage container by an outlet fitted with a closure device or tap. Clean the storage containers and water coolers regularly. CLEANING THE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT Routine cleaning is important to ensure a clean an d dust free hospital environment. There are usually many micro-organisms present in \u0093visible dirt\u0094, a nd routine cleaning helps to eliminate this dirt. Administrative and office areas with no patient contact require normal domestic cleaning. Most patient care areas should be cl eaned by wet mopping. Dry sweeping is not recommended. The use of a neutral detergent solution improves th e quality of cleaning. Hot water (80 \u00b0C) is a useful and effective environmental cleaner. Bacteriological testing of the environment is not recommended unless seeking a potential source of an outbreak. Any areas with visibly contaminated w ith blood or body fluids should be cleaned immediately. Isolation rooms and other areas that have patients with known transmissible infections should be cleaned with a detergent/disin fectant solution at least daily. All horizontal surfaces a nd all toilet areas shou ld be cleaned daily. WASTE MANAGEMENT Hospital waste is a potential reserv oir of pathogenic micro-organism s and requires appropriate safe and reliable handling. The main risk associated w ith infection is sharps contaminated with blood.2 There should be a person or persons responsible for the organization and management of waste collection, handling, storage and disposal. Waste management should be conducted in coordination with the infection control team. Waste management practices must meet national and local requirements; the following principles are recommended as a general guide. 4. E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 17 Principles of waste management Steps in the management of hospital waste include: generation, segregation/separation, collection, transportation, storage, treatment, final disposal. Develop a waste management plan that is based on an assessment of the current situation and minimizes the amount of waste generated. Segregate clinical (infectious) waste from non- clinical waste in dedicated containers. Transport waste in a dedicated trolley Store waste in specified ar eas with restricted access. Store sharps in sharps containers Sharps containers should be made of plastic or metal and have a lid that can be closed. They should be marked with the appropriate label or logo, e.g. a biohazard symbol for clinical (infectious) waste (see picture below). Mark the storage areas with a biohazard symbol. Ensure that the carts or trolleys used for the transport of segregated waste collection are not used for any other purpose \u0096 th ey should be cleaned regularly. Identify a storage area for waste prior to treatment or to final disposal area Treatment of hazardous and clinical /infectious waste Each health care facility should identify a method for the treatment of clinical /infectious waste. This may consist of transportation of infectious waste to a centralized waste treatment facility or on-site treatment of waste. Methods of disposal Sharps Puncture-proof containers which can be autoclaved, shredded and land-filled or microwaved, shredded and land-filled or treated by plasma pyrolysis. Biohazard symbol 4. E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 18 Deep burial in a secure area. Burial should be 2 to 3 meters deep and at least 1.5 meters above the groundwater table. Waste requiring incineration Anatomical parts and animal carcasses. Cytotoxic drugs (residues or outdated). Toxic laboratory chemi cals other than mercury. Waste that may be incinerated Patient-contaminated non-plastics and non-chlorinated plastics. Anatomical parts and animal carcasses. Waste that should not be incinerated Chlorinated plastics. Volatile toxic wastes such as mercury. Plastics, non-plastics contamin ated with blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions and infectious laboratory wastes. (Such wast es should be treated by steam sterilization in autoclavable bags or microwave treatment. Shredding may follow both these methods. If neither method is available, ch emical treatment with 1% hypochlorite or a similar disinfectant is recomm ended. However, excessive use of chemical disinfectants should be avoided as it may be a health and environmental hazard.) Radioactive waste (should be dealt with according to national laws). For further details please refer to WHO's Safe management of wastes fr om health-care activities (1999) at: http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_ health/medicalwaste/wastemanag/en/ 4.

E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 20 LAUNDRY Two categories of used linen are recognized. Wh ere there is visible contamination by blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions, this may be calle d \u0093soiled\" or \"contaminated\u0094. Other used linen is termed \u0093used\u0094. These two categories shoul d be segregated and treated separately. General instructions Handle all linen with minimum agitation to avoid aerosolisation of pathogenic micro- organisms. Place soiled/contaminated linen in impervious ba gs for transportation to avoid any spills or drips of blood, body fluids, s ecretions or excretions Disinfect by using hot water a nd/or bleach (use heavy-duty gl oves, eye protection and masks to protect against splashes). Autoclave linen before being supplied to the operating rooms/theatres and high-risk areas, e.g. burns units and transplant units. Wash linen (sheets, cotton blankets) in hot water (70 \u00b0C to 80 \u00b0C) and detergent, rinse and dry preferably in a dryer or in the sun. (Hea vy-duty washers/dryers are recommended for the hospital laundry.) Wash woollen blankets in warm water and dry in the sun, in dryers at cool temperatures or dry-clean. When laundering linen from an isolation room do not sort, shake, or handle excessively. Bedding Mattresses and pillows with plastic covers s hould be wiped over with a neutral detergent Mattresses without pl astic covers should be steam cleaned if they have been contaminated with body fluids. Wash pillows either by using the standard laundering procedure described above, or dry clean if contaminated with body fluids. REPROCESSING OF INSTRUMENTS AND EQUIPMENT3 The risk of transferring infection from instru ments and equipment is dependent on the following factors: 1. the presence of micro-or ganisms, the number and viru lence of these organisms; 2. the type of procedure that is going to be performed; invasive or non-invasive, and 3. the body site where the instrument/and or eq uipment will be used; penetrating the mucosal tissure or used on intact skin. 4. E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 21 The classification of risk of tr ansmission of infection by instrume nts and equipment has been called the \"Spalding Classification\"8 The risk of transmission is classi fied according to the site where the instrument is to be used. Contact sites for instrume nts may be classified as critical, semi critical or non-critical. Table 1 shows these cl assifications. The level of repr ocessing required is based on the classification and level of risk. Any instrument or equipment enteri ng into a sterile part of the body must be sterilized. Where the instrument or equi pment will be in contact with mucous membranes or nonintact skin, it must have undergone high-level di sinfection, and where ther e will be contact with intact skin, a low level of disinf ection or cleaning should be used.3 Table 1. Level of disinfection required for patient care equipment2,3,8 Application Classification Level of risk Level of reprocessing required Example Storage of reprocessed instrument Entry or penetration into sterile tissue, cavity or bloodstream Eg. Into vascular system Into sterile cavity Into sterile tissue Critical High Sterile Sterilization by steam under pressure or an automated low-temp chemical sterilant system, other liquid chemical sterilant or ethylene oxide sterilization. Surgical procedure Entry into sterile tissue arthroscopes, biopsies Intravascular cannulation Sterility must be maintained. packaged items must be allowed to dry before removeal from the sterilizer the integrity of the wrap must be maintained wraps should act as effective biobarrier during storage store away from potential environmental contaminants unpackaged sterile items must be used immediately Contact with intact nonsterile mucosa or nonintact skin Semi-critical Medium High level disinfection Heat tolerant items steam sterilize where possible if unable to steam sterilize- use thermal disinfection Heat-sensitive items low temperature automated chemical sterilant systems high level chemical disinfectant Respiratory therapy gastroscopy Store to protect from environmental contaminants Intact skin No contact with the patient Noncritical Low Items must be clean Clean after each use with detergent and water. if disinfection is required follow with appropriate disinfectant, e.g. 70% alcohol . Beds, sinks, etc Store in a clean dry place 4. E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 22 Reprocessing of instruments and equipm ent in an effective way includes 1. cleaning instruments and equipment immediately af ter use to remove all organic matter, chemicals and 2. disinfection (by heat and water or chemical disinfectants) or 3. sterilization. For more information on the selection and use of di sinfectants see APIC Guideline for selection and use of disinfectants (1996.) 9 Reprocessing principles3 There are certain principles that must be applied to ensure inst ruments and equipment have been appropriately reprocessed. 1. Staff training. Staff who work in the st erilizing service department and are responsible for the reprocessing of instruments and equipment must have undergone fo rmal training in how to clean, disinfect and sterilize instruments and equipment. The level of training must be appropriate for the level of responsibility that the staff member is expect ed to undertake. 2. Appropriate level of reprocessing As described above, it is essential th at the correct level of reprocessi ng of an instrument/equipment is chosen according to its intended use. This decision is made not according to what the instrument of equipment is, but rather what its intended use is. Steam sterilization is reco mmended as the most effect way of ach ieving sterility. However, this may not always be possible as some instruments may not be able to withstand the temperature or moisture required for sterilization using st eam. Other methods may be used to achieve sterility such as ethylene oxide or automated low temperature chemi cal sterilant systems, providing the manufacturer of the instrument/ equipment agrees that this is an effective means to sterilize or provide high-level disinfection to them. Under a new system in the European Union, manufacturers of reusable medical devices will need to provide reprocessing instructions when items are purchased. 3. Servicing of instruments and equipment Before sending medical devices for service they s hould be reprocessed appr opriately. If however, they are unable to be reprocessed before being re paired, they should be placed in a fluid-resistant plastic bag or container and labelled appropriately befo re being sent for repair. 4. Selected items that requi re special reprocessing. Items that require special treatment include: endoscopes respiratory and anaesthetic apparatus diagnostic ultrasonic transducers 4. E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 23 Instruments and equipment such as these may not be able to withstand the heat or the moisture of steam or thermal disinfection or even some chem ical agents. They therefore may require very delicate measures to reprocess them. It is essentia l that equipment that will not withstand the regular types of reprocessing must be reprocessed only in a department that ha s the proper reprocessing facilities. The manufacturer's instructions must be followed. 5. Storage Storage of instruments and equipment is an essen tial component in ensuring the product maintains its level of sterility or high-level disinfection. Most instruments and equipment are dry and packaged once they have been sterilized. They should be stored in a clean, dry environment and protected from any object that may cause them damage. Co rrect storage of sterile instruments and equipment is a critical component in keeping them sterile. 3 6. Patient care equipment Any equipment that is used for patients, and touche s only their intact skin, su ch as bedpans, urinals, commode chairs, blood pressure cuffs etc. should be cleaned and disinfected \u0096 usually in hot water (at least 70\u00b0C). CLEANING, DISINFECTION AND STERILIZATION Cleaning Prior to any reprocessing to achieve disinfection or sterility all instruments and equipment MUST be cleaned. If they are not cleaned properly, organi c matter may prevent the di sinfectant or sterilant from having contact with the instrument/equipmen t and may also bind and inactivate the chemical activity of the disinfectant. 10 If an instrument/equipment canno t be cleaned, then it cannot be sterilized or disinfected. After an instrument has been used, before it dries, it should be washed to remove any gross soiling. At this stage, detergent and wa ter is appropriate to use. There are four main methods for cl eaning of instruments and equipment: 1. Manual cleaning All surfaces of the instrument/equi pment MUST be cleaned, taking ca re to reach all channels and bores of the instrument. If instruments are being washed manually the following procedure should be followed: wear personal protective equipment (plastic ap ron, thick rubber gloves , eye protection, mask and/or face shield) remove any gross soiling on the instrument by rinsing in tepid water (15-18 degrees) take instrument fully apart and immerse all parts in warm water with a biodegradable, noncorrosive, nonabrasive, low foaming and fr ee rinsing detergent or use an enzymatic cleaner if necessary ensure all visible soil is rem oved from the instrument \u0096 follo w manufacturer's instructions 4. E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 24 rinse in hot water (unl ess contraindicated) dry the instrument either in drying cabinet, or hand dr y with clean lint-free cloth inspect to ensure the instrument is clean 2. Enzymatic cleaners Used for fibreoptic instruments and accessories, and other items that are difficult to clean. These products are hazardous and care should be taken when in contact with them. 3. Ultrasonic cleaners and automated washers Ultrasonic cleaners and automated washers are reco mmended for cleaning basic instruments that can withstand this process. Using a ma chine to wash the instruments will cut down on the handling of the instruments. These cleaners must be compliant w ith national guidelines and standards, and must be used according to the manufacturer's instructi ons. Ultrasonic cleaners DO NOT disinfect the instruments. By causing high-frequency, high-ener gy sound waves to hit the instrument/equipment, the soiling matter drops off the instrument and ont o the bottom of the compar tment, or loosens the soil enough so that it will be remove d during the rinsing process. These cleaners are not appropriate for use on cannul ated instruments (they cannot clean inside the instrument), plastic materials, tw o or more different metals, or so me glass instruments, syringes and lenses. Daily efficien cy tests should be done. 3 Disinfection Disinfection removes micro-organism s without complete sterilization. Disinfection is used to destroy organisms present on delicate or heat -sensitive instruments which cannot be sterilized or when single use items are not available. Disinfection is not a sterilizing process and must not be used as a convenient substitute for sterilization. Thermal di sinfection is not appropriate for instruments that will be used in critical sites (see Table 1) as these instruments must be sterile. Certain products and processes will provide differe nt levels of disinfection. These levels are classified as:2,3 (1) High-level disinfection (classed as critical in Table 1) . Destroys all micro-organisms except some bacterial spores (especially if there is heavy contamination). (2) Intermediate disinfection (classed as semi-critical in Table 1). Inactivates Mycobacterium tuberculosis vegetative bacteria, most viru ses and most fungi, but does not always kill bacterial spores. (3) Low-level disinfection (classified as non-critical). Can kill most bacteria, some viruses and some fungi, but cannot be relied on to kill more resistant bacteria such as M. tuberculosis or bacterial spores. The two methods of achieving disinfection are thermal and chemical disinfection. 1. Thermal disinfection (pasteurisation) If an instrument is able to withst and the process of heat and moisture and is not required to be sterile, then thermal disinfection is appropriate. By usi ng heat and water at temperatures and times that destroy pathogenic, vegetative agents this is a very e fficient method of disinfection. 4. E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 25 The level of disinfection depends on the water temperature and the time the instrument is exposed to that temperature Table 2. Minimum surface temperature a nd time required for thermal disinfection 3 Surface temperature (0oC) Minimum disinfection time required (minutes) 90 1 80 10 75 30 70 100 2. Chemical disinfection The performance of chemical disinfectants is dependent on a number of factors including; temperature, contact time, concentration, pH, pr esence of organic or i norganic matter and the numbers and resistance of th e initial bioburden on a surface.3 Instrument grade disinfectants ar e classified as high, intermediate or low level. When used according to the manufacturer's guidelines disinfectants will fall into one of these levels \u0096 see Table 3. Table 3. Chemical disinfectant - level of disinfection achieved 3 Level of disinfection Activity against microbes High-level chemical disinfectant Inactivates all microbial pathogens except where there are large numbers of bacterial spores Intermediate-level disinfectant Inactivates all microbial pathogens except bacterial endospores Low-level disinfectant Rapidly inactivates most vegetative bacteria as well as medium sized lipid containing viruses, but may not destroy bacterial endospores, mycobacteria, fungi or small nonlipid viruses. Selection of disinfectant There is no single ideal disinfectant. Different grades of disinfectants are used for different purposes. Only instrument grade disinfectants are suitable to use on medical instruments and equipment. Hospital grade or household grade disinfectants must not be used on instruments, they are only suitable for environmental purposes. Monitoring of the disinfectant is impo rtant if it is a multi-use solution. It is important that it is stored correctly and according to the manuf acturers instructions. Be sure not to contaminate the solution when pouring out for use. Glutaraldehyde is the generally the most approp riate chemical disinfectant that will provide high- level disinfection. This chemical mu st be used under very strict c ontrolled conditions and in a safe working environment. Glutaraldehyde 2% is appr opriate high level disinfectant for endoscopes, respiratory therapy equipment and for materials th at are destroyed by heat. An immersion time of > 20 mins. Flexible endoscopes are particularly difficult to disinfect and very easy to damage. It is extremely important that meticulous mechanical clea ning MUST always precede sterilization or disinfection procedures. See the APIC Guideline for selectio n and use of disinfectants (1996.) 9 4. E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 26 Sterilization Sterilization is the destruction of all micro-orga nisms and can be achieved by either physical or chemical methods.2 Sterilization is necessary for medical de vices penetrating ster ile body sites. (see Table 1). Cleaning to remove visi ble soiling in reusable equipmen t should precede st erilization. All materials must be wrapped before sterilization. On ly wrapped/packed sterilized materials should be described as sterile. Before any instrument or equipment goes under the process of steam sterilization, the following should be checked: 1. ensure that the instrume nt can withstand the proce ss (e.g. steam under pressure) 2. ensure that the instrument has been adequately cleaned; 3. ensure that the instrument does not require any special treatment; 4. ensure that records are kept of the ster ilisation and traceability of the instrument. Instruments and equipment will be sterile only if one of the followi ng sterilizing processes is used. 1. steam under pressure (moist heat); 2. dry heat; 3. ethylene oxide; 4. automated environmentally sealed low-te mperature peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide plasma and other chemical sterilant systems or sterilants; and 5. irradiation. The above sterilizing methods are designed to give a st erility assurance level of at least 10 -6 (see glossary) as long as the process is validated a nd is according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Ultraviolet light units, in cubators, microwave ovens, domestic ove ns and pressure cookers must not be used for sterilizing. 1. Steam under pressure (m oist heat) sterilization 3 This is the most efficient and reliable ways of achie ving sterility of instrument s and equipment. This method sterilizes and dries the sterile package as pa rt of the cycle. This is recommended in the office based practice. There are several types of steam under pressure ster ilizers (previously called autoclaves). Downward gravity displacement \u0096 jacketed and nonjacketed. These are designed for the sterilization of waste, solutions and instruments. Self-contained (benchtop) \u0096 these are recommended for the office based practice as they are able to do small quantities or fairly simple items. Be nchtop sterilisers do not take wrapped items and therefore items must be used imme diately after they are removed from the sterilizer. There will be differences in the models and types of features th at are offered may vary. These may include; drying stage, ability to take packaged and unwrapped items, systems to m onitor temperature, pressure and holding time. Prevacuum (porous load) and Operator convertible . 4. E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 27 2. Dry heat sterilization3 Dry heat sterilization is caused by hot air that destroys pathogens th rough oxidation. Dry heat sterilizers have had limited value because it is di fficult to maintain the same temperature throughout the load, while the high temperatur es and long times required to achie ve sterility makes this method undesirable for many situations. Th e manufacturer's instructions mu st be followed, the door to the unit must not be opened while the m achine is in sterilizing cycle. 3. Ethylene oxide (EO) 3 Ethylene oxide gas is appropriate to use for sterilization of instruments or equipment made from heat labile materials or devices that contain electronic components. The time required to process the instrument is dependent on the temperature, humidity and concentration level of the gas. The gas must penetrate the packaging and reach all surf aces of the instrument or equipment requiring sterilization. The usual time for such a process is between 12 hours and more than 24 hours. Because EO is toxic this gas is restricted in health ca re facilities and must be used according to strict guidelines to ensure staff safety. The manufacturer's instructions mu st be followed for the packaging, sterilization proce ss, validation with Bacillus subtilis and aeration process. 4. Automated chemical (low temperature) systems 3 Hydrogen peroxide plasma in a fully automated cycle can achie ve low temperature, low moisture sterilization within a 45 -80 minute cycle depending on the model of sterilizer used. The packaging used must be non-woven/non-ce llulose polypropylene wraps Peracetic acid is a low-temperature steri lization method. Peracetic aci d 0.2% is placed in an environmentally sealed chamber and fully auto mated processing system. The process achieves moist, low temperature sterilizati on within 25-30 minutes. Items are sterilized in special containers. 5. Irradiation Gamma radiation is available from some commercial gamma irradiat ion facilities, however it is not readily available for use in health care facilities. Only those instruments and equipment that have undergone the entire ster ilizing process can be regarded as sterile. Items must be wrapped or packaged appropri ately to be considered sterile. 2 Materials for packaging include: Paper. This prevents contamination if it remain s intact. It maintains sterility for a long period, can act as a steril e field and can also be used to wrap dirty devices after the procedure. Non-woven disposable textiles. Containers. These can be used only if they c ontain material intended for a single treatment procedure for a single patient. The end-user must check the physical in tegrity of the package before use. 4. E NVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 28 Quality control parameters for the sterilization pr ocess which also serve as a check list for the Sterilization Department include: load number, load content, temperature and time exposure record chart, physical/chemical testing, biological testing. Regular engineering maintenance on sterilization equipment must be performed and documented. For details refer to Young, Jack H. and Reichert, Marimargaret. Sterilization Technology for the Health Care Facility , 2 ed. New York, USA, Aspen Publishers, 1997. Boiling of medical devices for reuse is not r ecommended since it does not guarantee sterility. However, in certain resource-poor situations where steam sterilization is not possible, these items should be thoroughly cleaned and subjected to a cycle in a pressure cooker for 30 minutes. Special consideration - CJD3 The only infectious agent that requires special treatment in order to ensure decontamination is the CJD prion. Historically, CJD has been transmitt ed through implanted brain electrodes that were disinfected with ethanol and form aldehyde after use on a patient known to have CJD. Iatrogenic transmission has been observed in some patients who have been re cipients of contaminated human growth hormone, gonadotropin and corneal, pericardial and dura mater grafts.9 These prions resist normal inactivation methods; The preferred method is steam sterilization for at least 30 minutes at a temperature of 132oC in a gravity displacement sterilizer when material has been contaminated. If a prevacuum sterilizer is used, 18 minutes at 134oC has been found to be effective. Semi-critical and noncritical items may be immersed in 1N sodium hydroxide, a caustic solution, for 1 hour at room temperature and then steam sterilized for 30 minutes at a temperature of 121 \u00b0C. Table 4. Common disinfectants used for en vironmental cleaning in hospitals Disinfectants Recommended use Precautions Sodium hypochlorite 1% in-use dilution, 5% solution to be diluted 1:5 in clean water Disinfection of material contaminated with blood and body fluids Should be used in well-ventilated areas Protective clothing requi red while handling and using undiluted Do not mix with strong acids to avoid release of chlorine gas Corrosive to metals Bleaching powder 7g/litre with 70% available chlorine Table 6 shows dilutions for bleach Toilets / bathrooms - may be used in place of liquid bleach if this is unavailable Same as above Alcohol (70%) Isopropyl, ethyl alcohol, methylated spirit.

CARE OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS2 Health care workers (HCW) are at risk of acquiring infection through occupational exposure.2 Hospital employees can also transmit infections to patients and other employees. Thus, an employees' health programme must be in place to prevent and manage infec tions in hospital staff. Employees\u0092 health should be review ed at recruitment, including i mmunization history and previous exposures to communicable diseases (e.g. tuberculosis) and immune stat us. Some previous infections such as varicella-zoster virus may be assessed by serological tests. Immunization recommended for sta ff includes: hepatitis A and B, influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, and diphtheria. Im munization against varicella, rabies may be considered in specific cases. The Mantoux skin test will document a previous tuberculosis (TB) exposure. Specific post-exposure policies must be devel oped, and compliance ensured for a number of infectious diseases for example: human immunodefic iency virus (HIV), viral hepatitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), varice lla, rubella and tuberculosis. Health care workers with infections should report their i llnesses/incident to st aff clinics for further evaluation and management. EXPOSURE TO HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) The route of transmission for HIV is person to person via: sexual cont act, sharing of needles contaminated with HIV, infusions that are contam inated with HIV, transplantation of organs or tissues that are infected with HIV.11 The risk of a health care worker acquiring HIV after a needlestick or other \"sharps\" injury is less than 0.5%.11 Risk reduction must be undertaken for all bloodborne pathogens, including: ad herence to standard precauti ons using personal protective equipment and appropriate use of safety devices and a needle disposal system to limit sharps exposure. Training for health care workers in safe sharps practice should be ongoing. Information on preventive measures must be provid ed to all staff with potential exposure to blood and blood products. Policies which are in keeping with the local and national guidelines must include screening of patients, disposal of sharps and wastes, protec tive clothing, managing inoculation accidents, sterilizati on and disinfection. Hospital policy must include measures to obtain serological testing of source patients promptly where necessary, usually with the patient's inform ed consent. Post exposure prophylaxis should be started as per local or national guidelines. EXPOSURE TO HEPATITIS B VIRUS The route of transmission for Hepatitis B virus is through body substances su ch as blood and blood products, saliva, cerebrospinal flui d, peritoneal, pleural, pericardia l and synovial fluid, amniotic fluid, semen and vaginal secretions and any other body fluid containing blood.11 Following standard 5. C ARE OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS 34 precautions is important, but immunization is the best way of preventing transmission to health care staff. All HCWs at risk must be vaccinated. Staff infected with bloodborne pathogens may tr ansmit these infections to patients and require careful evaluation with respect to their duties. This status should not be used as cause for discrimination. EXPOSURE TO HEPATITIS C VIRUS The route of infection is mainly parenteral. Sexual transmission doe s occur but is far less frequent. 11 No post-exposure therapy is available for hepa titis C, but seroconversion (if any) must be documented. As for hepatitis B viral infection, the source person must be tested for HCV infection. For any occupational exposure to bloodborne pathoge ns, counselling and appr opriate clinical and serological follow-up must be provided. SHARPS INJURIES Needlestick injuries are the commonest of shar ps injuries, although other contaminated sharp instruments may also cause injuri es. All health care workers w ith potential exposure should be vaccinated. For other personnel, the risk of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV infection should be assessed and appropriate immunizatio n or chemoprophylactic steps taken Immediate treatment of such injuries should encourage bleeding and washing thoroughly with running water and an antiseptic solution. Consult th e infection control team for further advice. An incident reporting system should be in place. It should not be seen as punitive; active support by managers should encourage prompt and accurate reporting. TUBERCULOSIS Health care workers have varying risks for exposure to tuberculosis (TB). Health care workers at the greatest risk of exposure are those working in TB-risk areas such as medical wards, chest clinics, bronchoscopy units, radiology units, TB laboratories, HIV wards a nd autopsy rooms. If a staff member has been exposed to TB he or she should report to the Infection C ontrol Practitioner or the Staff Health Nurse depending on the hospital pr otocol for health care worker exposures. 5. C ARE OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS 35 MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS Transmission of meningococci to health care staff is most likely within 24 hours of admission of the patient, prior to the patient receiving appropriate antibiotic/chemoprophylaxis. Health care workers in close respiratory contact with such cases shou ld receive chemoprophylaxis with ciprofloxacin or an effective alternative agent. Close respirator y contact with the patien t includes mouth-to-mouth contact, sharing of drink containers or cigarettes. SARS The health care facility should have a clear set of guidelines for preventing staff exposure to SARS. Health care workers in contact with patients with suspected or probable SA RS should be monitored daily for signs and symptoms of SARS, particularly for changes in temperat ure. If staff members indicate any signs or symptoms of SARS, they should be asse ssed by the infection control practitioner or the infection contro l team as to the appropriateness of home isolation. (S ee chapter 6.1 for infection control procedures for SARS infections.) OTHER INFECTIONS: VARICELLA, INFLUENZA, PERTUSSIS, DIPHTHERIA, RABIES Transmission of these micro-orga nisms may be uncommon, but polic ies to manage staff exposure should be developed. Vaccination of hospital staff against vari cella is recommended. Influenza vaccinations should be given yearly. Rabies vaccinations may be appropriate in some facilities in countries where rabies is enzootic. 36 6. INFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS SEVERE ACUTE RESPI RATORY SYNDROME (SARS) Causative agent Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently recognized febrile respiratory illness that was first seen in southern China in November 2002. The organism responsible for the disease is a novel coronavirus \u0096 SARS CoV.12 Mode of transmission The novel coronavirus has been found in sputum, tears, blood, urine and faeces. 12 The organism is mainly transmitted through drop lets discharged through the respiratory tract of the infected person, especially during coughing, sneezing and talking. The chances of infection are therefore highest during close, person-to-person or f ace-to-face contact with someone who has symptoms of SARS. The organism can be shed in the faeces for 30 days and has been shown to survive on hard surfaces for more than 24 hours. 12 Therefore contact transmission is an important component, e ither person-to-person or via contaminated environmental surfaces or equipment. Airborne transmission ha s not been ruled out. The incubation period is 2-10 days with a median of 4.5 days. The risk of transmission during the prodrome phase of the illness appears to be low. Prior to having any symptoms patients are not thought to be infectious. Susceptibility Cases of SARS have been reported mainly among persons who had direct, close contact with an infected person, such as household members or h ealth care workers who cared for a symptomatic patient(s). Exposure may occur before it is reco gnized that the person has SARS and additional precautions have not been implemented. Clinical picture in SARS patients The clinical picture of SARS closely resemble s that of influenza during the prodromal phase. The common clinical features are: During days 1-3, the patient has a high fever ( 38\u00b0C), headache, muscle ache and respiratory symptoms such as dry cough. In addition, some clusters of SARS patients ha ve shown prominent gast rointestinal symptoms (mainly diarrhoea). 6. I NFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS 37 From about days 4-5, the illness progresses into a lower respiratory pha se characterized by shortness of breath and worsening of cough. Chest X-ray changes are suggestive of atypical pneumonia: early, small hilar or progressing to more generalized patchy interstitial infiltrates. Low white cell count and platel et count; abnormal liver function are common; renal function is usually normal. From about day 7, almost 90% of cases will begi n to improve over the next 1-2 weeks. About 10% of cases will have a severe respiratory il lness requiring more intensive support such as oxygen therapy, intubations or mechanical ventil ation. Currently there is a high case fatality rate in this group. Case fatality rates are higher in the elde rly and those with concurrent illnesses. Clinical case definition of SARS13 The following clinical case defi nition of SARS has been devel oped for public health purposes. A person with a history of: Fever ( 38\u00b0C ) AND one or more symptoms of lower respir atory tract illness (c ough, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath) AND radiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) OR autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of pneumonia or RDS without an identifiable cause AND no alternative diagnosis can fully explain the illness. Laboratory case definition of SARS 13 A person with symptoms and signs that are clinically suggestive of SARS AND with positive laboratory findings for SARS-CoV based on one or more of the following diagnostic criteria: PCR positive for SARS-CoV PCR positive using a validated method from: At least two different clinical specimens (eg nasopharyngeal and stool) OR The same clinical specimen collected on two or more occasions duri ng the course of the illness (eg sequential nasopharyngeal aspirates) OR Two different assays or repeat PCR using a new RNA extract from the original clinical sample on each occasion of testing. Seroconversion by ELISA or IFA Negative antibody test on acute serum followed by positive antibody test on convalescent phase serum tested in parallel OR 6. I NFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS 38 Fourfold or greater rise in antibody titre between acute and co nvalescent phase sera tested in parallel. Virus isolation Isolation in cell culture of SARS-CoV from any specimen AND PCR confirmation using a validated method. Testing should be undertaken only in a national or regional reference laboratory as per WHO recommendations: Use of laboratory methods for SARS diagnosis , http://www.who.int/csr/sars/labmethods/en/ WHO will assist resource-poor c ountries to confirm their first cases of SARS through laboratory collaboration. See: http://www.who.in t/csr/sars/postoutbreak/en/print.html Infection control precautions for SARS Infection control for SARS i nvolves a two-level approach: Standard precautions (see Chapter 3) which apply to ALL patients at ALL times including those who have SARS, and Additional precautions (see Chapter 3) which should include; droplet precautions contact precautions airborne precautions A combination of these precautions will give the appropriate infection control. Strict adherence to these precautions is required to break the chain of infection transmission. The essential steps include: Placing the patient in a single room \u0096 is olation, and avoiding unnecessary contact Use of personal protective equipment for all in close proximity to the patient or the patient's environment Strict personal hygiene of staff (e.g. not touc hing face or mask, eyes or hair when in the patient's room, ensuring hands are wa shed after leaving the patient's room) If transport of the patient is required, the patient shoul d wear a respiratory mask. Annex 3 summarizes these steps so infection contro l practitioners can ensure all precautions are in place. Transportation of patients with SARS Limit the movement and transport of patients from the isolation room/ar ea for essential purposes only. If transportatio n is required out of the is olation room/area the patient should wear a mask and a gown where possible. All staff involved in the transportation should wear personal protective equipment. 6. I NFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS 39 Personal protective equipment used for SARS Personal protective equipment reduces the risk of infection if used corr ectly. It includes: gloves (nonsterile), mask (N95 preferable), long sleeved cuffed gown, plastic apron if splashing of blood, body fluids, excretions an d secretions is anticipated, protective eyewear/goggles/visors/face shields, cap (to be used in high risk situations where there may be increased aerosols). Who should use personal protective equipment? Anyone who enters the isola tion room/area including: all health care workers who pr ovide direct patient care (e.g. doctors, nurses, radiographers, physiotherapists), all support staff including medi cal aides and cleaning staff, family members or visitors, all laboratory workers handling spec imens from a patient with SARS, all sterilizing service workers handling equipment that requires decontamination and has come from a patient with SARS. Waste disposal All waste generated in the isolation room/area sh ould be disposed of in suitable containers or bags. All waste from a SARS room should be treated as clinical (i nfectious) waste. Staff responsible for routinely removing wast e from isolation wards/areas should wear full personal protective equipment when removing waste. One waste disposal bag is usually adequate, providing waste can be placed in the bag without contaminating the outside of the bag. If that is not possible, two bags are needed (double bagging). Liquid waste such as urine or faeces can be safe ly flushed into the sewer system if there is an adequate sewage system in place. Where there is no adequate sewage system, ur ine and faeces should be decontaminated prior to being flushed into the sewage system. Waste disposal bags should include appropriate biohazard labelling, and be treated and disposed of as per the policy of the hospital and in accordance with national regulations pertaining to hospital waste . Specimen collection and transportation Following standard precautions, all specimens should be regarded as potentially infectious and staff should adhere rigorously to protective measures in order to minimize exposure. Specimens for transport must be pl aced in leak-proof specimen bags, which have a separate sealable pocket for the specimen (i.e. a plastic biohazard specimen bag.) Personnel who transport 6. I NFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS 40 specimens should be trained in safe handling practic es and decontamination pr ocedures in the case of a spill. The accompanying request form should be clearly ma rked as \"suspected or probable SARS\" and the laboratory notified by telephone that the specimen is \"on its way.\" Specimens should be hand delivered where possible. Pneumatic tube system s should not be used to transport specimens. Hospital screening, admission procedures and triage Hospitals need to be prepared for the management of SARS cases. When a SARS alert has been issued by WHO, patient s should be immediately isolated and infection control precautions instituted. For further inform ation see WHO Alert, veri fication and public health management of SARS in the post-outbreak period: http://www.who.int/csr/sars/postoutbreak/en/ Care of SARS patients in isolation Suspect and probable SARS cases should be cared for in single rooms to preven t direct or indirect transmission. Strict adherence to infection control guidelines is absolutely necessary to prevent transmission of infection between patients and from patient s to health care workers and others. Care of patients in isolation uni ts becomes a challenge when there are inadequate resources, or when the source patient has poor hygienic habits, deliberat ely contaminates the environment, or cannot be expected to assist in maintaining infectio n control precautions to limit transmission of microorganisms (children, patients having altered mental state, or elderly). In caring SARS patients in isolation, the following guidelines are to be followed: Preparation of the isolation room Ensure additional precautions by indicating wi th appropriate signage on the door (for example, biohazard logo). Place a log book at the entrance of the isolation room. All health care workers or visitors entering the isolation area must sign the log book. Remove all non-essential furnitu re. The remaining furniture s hould be easy to clean and should not conceal or retain dirt or moisture, either within or around it. Collect linen as needed. Stock the hand basin with suitable supplies for hand washing. Place appropriate waste bags in the room on a foot-operated bin. Place a puncture-proof containe r for sharps in the room. Keep the patient\u0092s personal belongings to a minimum. Keep water pitcher and cup, tissue wipes, and all items necessary for attending to personal hygiene within the patient\u0092s reach. The patient should be allocated his/her own non-critical items of patient care equipment, e.g. stethoscope, thermometer and sphygmomanometers . Any item of patient care equipment that is required for other patients should be thor oughly cleaned and disinf ected prior to use. Set up a trolley outside the door to hold pers onal protective equipment. A checklist may be useful to ensure all equipment is available (see Annex 4). 6. I NFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS 41 Place appropriate container with a lid outside the door for equipm ent that requires disinfection and sterilization. Once equipment has been a ppropriately cleaned it can be sent to the sterilizing service department. Keep adequate equipment required for cleani ng and disinfection inside the patients' room. For more information on isolation rooms see the CDC Guidelines for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals; http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/hip/isolat/isolat.htm . (See Annex 5 for an example diagram of an appropriate isolation room for SARS.) Cleaning the room Scrupulous daily cleaning of the isolation unit is essential to prev ent cross infection. Entering the room Collect all equipment needed. Sign the log book Wear personal protective equipment Enter the room and shut the door. Attending the patient Give careful instructions and expl anations to patient and visitors so that they cooperate fully with the precautions. Teach the visitors and the patient how to observe safe and correct procedures in order to prevent spread of infection. (S ee Annex 6, Infection control advi ce to contacts of a suspected or probable SARS case.) If the patient is a child, isolate the family care giver in the same unit. Catering Serve food on disposable crockery to be eaten with disposable cutlery (if available). Non-disposable crockery and cu tlery should be washed using hot water (70\u00b0C) and detergent, rinsed and dried. Where possible, eating utensils should be clean ed in a dishwasher us ing a hot water cycle (reaching at least 70\u00b0C). Excreta If there is no bedpan flusher/disi nfector available in the isolation area, bedpans and urinals should be bagged in the isolation room, take n and emptied immediately and th en washed in a bedpan washer/ hot boiling water, dried and returned immediately to the patient\u0092s room. If sewage treatment systems are not available, secretions and excre tions should be disinfected prior to their sewage. Reusable bedpans, urinals and sputum mugs shoul d be cleaned with a ne utral detergent then disinfected with an appropriate disinfectant, for example 5% s odium hypochlorite solution. Wash and dry to reuse. 6. I NFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS 42 Dressings Discard waste material and dirt y dressings in clinical (infect ious) waste bag. Keep used lotions/medications in the room a nd do not use for non-SARS patients. Leaving the room Remove personal protective equi pment in the correct order: 1. Remove gloves (peel from hand and discard into rubbish bin) 2. Use alcohol-based handrub or wash hands 3. Remove cap and face shield (place cap in bin and if reusable place face shield in container for decontamination) 4. Remove mask - by grasping elastic behind ears - do not touch front of mask 5. Remove gown (place in rubbish bin) 6. Use alcohol-based handrub or wash hands 7. Leave the room 8. Once outside room use alcohol handrub again or wash hands Wash hands using plain soap, antimicrobial agen t or waterless antiseptic agent such as an alcohol-based hand gel. Discharging the patient Inform the infection control team when the pa tient is due to be di scharged. (See Annex 7, Infection control checklist: disc harge of a patient with susp ect or probable severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).) The patient and family should be educated as to the appropriate precautions to take at home A checklist may be used to ensure patients and th eir family/contacts have been advised of all the appropriate infection control pr ecautions to take (see Annex 7). Carry out appropriate cleaning and disinfection of the room. Care of the deceased 14 Health care workers must fo llow all infection control precautions when caring for the deceased SARS patient. Full personal protective equipment must be worn. The body should be fully sealed in an impermeable body bag prior to transfer to the mortuary. No leaking of body fluids should occur and the outside bag should be clean. Transfer to the mortuary should o ccur as soon as po ssible after death. If the family of the patient wishes to view the body, it may be allowed to do so as long as family members wear personal protective equipm ent. This should happen before the body is transferred to the mortuary. Cultural sensitivity should be recognized and cons idered in situations where a patient dies and has SARS . 6. I NFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS 43 Post mortem A post mortem examination of someone who had or probably had SARS is classified as a very high-risk procedure.15 Therefore a post mortem should be avoided if at all possible. Minimizing the risk from an infected cadaver If, however, a post mortem is required, full inf ection control precautions for SARS should be observed when undertaking the post mortem. Prevent the production of aerosols by: 16 avoiding the use of power saws, conducting procedures under water if there is a chance of aerozolation, avoiding splashing when removing any organs, using clear plastic bags over the cadaver's head while eviscera ting the brain \u0096 some facilities are equipped with special tents for this procedure Use the minimal amount of equipment in the autopsy. Avoid using scalpels and scissors with pointed ends. Never pass instruments and equipment by hand \u0096 always use a tray. If possible use disposable instruments and equipment. Keep the number of staff present to a minimum. Use of a circulator (assistant) 16 The pathologist and the anatomical pathology tec hnician will have contact with the patient and therefore may be classified as \"dirty or c ontaminated\". The use of a \"clean\" person as a circulator will help to minimize contact with potentially infected or contaminated tissues, fluids and surfaces. The circulator will be able to: label specimen containers without contamin ation on the outside of the container, complete any paperwork and record spontan eous notes required by the pathologist, record organ weights and other records, act as a liaison between the pathologist and a ny clinicians that may be required so that there is no contact with telephone s, computers, records, etc. Mortuary care/ funeral director's premises17 Staff of the mortuary or funeral home must be informed that the deceased had SARS. They must be educated as to the appropriate precaution s to take in the event there is exposure to the body. Embalming is not recommended in the case of SARS: contact with the deceased SARS patient should be avoided where at all possible, the patient should be buried or cremated as soon as possible to reduce the risk of exposure to staff. 6. I NFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS 44 Hygienic preparation of the deceased (e.g. cleaning, tidying of hair, trimming of nails, shaving) should also be discouraged. INFECTIONS WITH MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT ORGANISMS The overuse and misuse of antimicrobials has resulte d in the development of antimicrobial resistance in many parts of the world. In health care settings, the spread of resistant organisms is facilitated when handwashing, infection control precautions, and equi pment cleaning are suboptimal. The strategies for control of antimic robial resistance thus consist of: appropriate use of antimicrobials strengthening of basic in fection control measures. Appropriate antimicrobial use Each health care facility shoul d have an antimicrobial use pr ogramme. This policy must be implemented through the Infection Control Comm ittee or an Antimicrobial Use Committee (see below). antibiotic use must be justifiable on the basis of the clinical diagnosis and known or expected infecting microorganisms, appropriate specimens for bacteriological exam ination must be obtained before initiating antibiotic treatment, in order to confirm the treatment is appropriate, the selection of an antibiotic must be based not only on the nature of the disease and that of the pathogenic agent(s), but on the sensitiv ity patterns, patient tolerance, and cost, the physician should receive timely, relevant inform ation of the prevalence of resistance in the facility, an agent with as narrow a spect rum as possible should be used, antibiotic combinations shoul d be avoided, if possible, selected antibiotics may be restricted in use, the correct dose must be used (low dosages may be ineffective for treating infections, and encourage the development of resistant strain s, while excessive doses may have adverse effects, and may not prevent resistance). Antimicrobial use committee This committee recommends antibiotics for the form ulary, establishes prescribing policies, reviews and approves practice guidelines, audits antibiotic use, oversees education, and interacts with pharmaceutical representatives. The committee may be a subcommittee of the Hosp ital Infection Control Co mmittee (HICC) or an independent committee working in liaison with HICC. The most important antibiotic-resistant bacteria are: methicillin-resistant (or aureus Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus 6. I NFECTION PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS 45 faecalis (VRE); multiresistant gram-negative bacteria ; and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR- TB). Organisms with acquired resistance to multiple antibiotics are common in many hospitals. Other organisms may be important in some health care facilities, but this document will concentrate on MRSA, VRE and MDR-TB. Control of endemic antibiotic resistance Ensure appropriate use of antibiotics (optimal choice, dosage and duration of antimicrobial therapy and chemoprophylaxis ba sed on defined hospital antibiotic policy, monitoring and antibiotic resistance, and up-to-date antimicrobial guidelines). Institute protocols (guidelines) fo r intensive infection control pr ocedures and provide adequate facilities and resources, esp ecially for handwashing, infectio n control precautions (e.g. isolation), and environmental control measures. Improve antimicrobial prescribing practices th rough educational and administrative methods. Limit use of topical antibiotics. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Epidemic strains of MRSA have tremendous pot ential for nosocomial tran smission. MRSA strains are often resistant to several antibiotics and are of ten sensitive only to vancomycin and one or two other antibiotics. Once introduced into a hospital th ey spread rapidly, since transmission is usually through the hands of health care staff. The following precautions are required for the prevention of spread of epidemic MRSA: minimize ward transfers of staff and patients, ensure early detection of cases, especially if they are admitted from another hospital (screening of high risk patients will ensure ea rly detection and appropriate precautions can be implemented), isolate infected or colonized pa tients in a single room, isola tion unit or cohorting in a larger ward, treat patients with MRSA pneumonias with airborne precautions in place, reinforce handwashing by staff after contact with infected or colonize d patients; consider using an antiseptic handwashing ag ent or alcohol handrub or handgel, wear gloves when attending to the patient or when handling MR SA-contaminated materials, wear a gown or apron when attending to the patie nt or when handling contaminated materials, develop protocols or guidelines for manageme nt of patients and staff during an outbreak, ensure that operating surgeons should not perform surgeries until declared negative for carriage. Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) Enterococci may be cultured from surgical wound in fections, liver and intra-abdominal abscesses, and foot ulcers in di abetic patients. E. faecium and E. faecalis are commensal organisms in the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy individuals. 6. I NFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS 46 Transmission The major route of transmission of VRE within th e health care facility is the hands of HCWs following contact with patients with VRE or their immediate environment. Usually this is associated with inadequate handwashing. Susceptibility VRE readily colonizes the bowel without causing symptoms of infection. VRE does not cause diarrhoea. Patients who are at an increased risk for VRE colonization or infecti on are, for example: critically ill patients (ICU patients), immunocompromised patients (patients on chemotherapy or transplant patients), patients who have had intra-abdomin al or cardiothoracic procedures, patients who have central venous catheters, patients who have had a pr olonged hospital stay, and patients who have had recent broad-spectrum antibi otic therapy, or who ha ve received oral or intravenous vancomycin. It may be necessary to screen for VRE in the heal th care facility, especially in high-risk patients as above. Infection control measures for VRE Standard precautions with additional c ontact precautions s hould be applied. Contact precautions See chapter 3 and Annex 2. It is essential that all staff, visitors or any other person entering the patient's room strictly follow standard and contact precautions. Daily environmental cleaning is essential. Patients must have their own patient care items. Any item that enters the patient's room must be decontaminated after it is removed from the room prior to going to another area in the hospital or being used on another patient. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It affects one third of the world's population.18 Of particular concern is the rise and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Multidrug-resistan any ination of anti-TB drugs that includes Isoniazid and Rifampicin (the two most effective anti-TB drugs). 18 Susceptibility MDR-TB arises in areas where TB contro l is poor, such as developing countries. 6. I NFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS 47 Occurrence The incidence of MDR-TB in developing countries is high and in some countries it threatens the success of TB control. Several geographical areas have been identifi ed by WHO as having a prevalence of MDR-TB greater than 3% of newl y diagnosed cases of TB.18 Transmission TB is usually transmitted by exposure to airb orne droplet nuclei produced by people with pulmonary or laryngeal disease, during expi ratory efforts such as coughing and sneezing. Prolonged close contact with such patient s increases the risk of transmission Infection control measures for MDR-TB Rapid detection, immediate implementation of infection control precautions for all suspect or proven cases, diagnosis and treatment of TB, transport of patient \u0096 patient should wear a surgical mask, appropriate infection control precautions incl ude standard precautions plus additional precautions (airborne precautions). Standard and airborne precautions. See chapter 3. Health care workers HCWs working in areas where th ere are patients with TB, such as chest clinics, bronchoscopy units, radiology units, and TB laboratories are at greater risk of occupational exposure to TB. Such HCW should have yearly Mant oux tests. If they test pos itive they should have an X-ray and clinical review. INFECTIONS WITH VIRAL HAEMORRHAGIC FEVERS Viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF) are severe acute viral illnesses that will present with a sudden onset of fever, lethargy, weakne ss and headache. This may be followed by pharyngitis, diarrhoea and vomiting and a maculopapular rash.11 Hemorrhagic diathesis often occurs along with liver damage, renal failure, central nervous system involvement and terminal shock with multiorgan failure. 11 Viral haemorrhagic fevers include; Ebola-Marbur g viral diseases, African haemorrhagic fever, Marburg virus disease, Ebola virus, haemorrhagic fever. The case fatality rate of Marburg virus infection (reported primary cas es ) is approximately 25%, whereas cas e fatality of Ebola infections in Africa ranges from 50% - 90%. 11 6. I NFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS FOR SELECTED SITUATIONS 48 Mode of transmission11 Human to human transmission by: direct contact with infected blood, secretions, organs, semen, risk of transmission increases as the illness be comes worse, the highest level of transmission being in the late stages of the illness when the patient is vomiting. Infection control precautions 11,19 Strict infection control precautions MUST be followe d at all times when cari ng for all patients with VHF. These include: Standard precautions (see section 3) Isolation precautions for VHF \u0096 These guidelines give only a brief overview. 1. Isolate the patient. 2. Wear personal protective equipment (at all times when in contact with patient or environment). 3. Clean and disinfect spills, waste, and reusable equipment safely. 4. Clean and disinfect soiled linen and laundry safely. 5. Use safe disposal methods for non-re usable supplies and clinical waste. 6. Provide information about the risk of VHF transmission to health care workers. 7. Reinforce the use of VHF isolation pr ecautions with all health care worker.s 8. Provide information to families and the community about prevention of VHFs and care of patients.

Pr\u00fcss, A. of wastes from health-care Geneva, 1998 (available at http://www.who.int/water_sanita tion_health/medicalwaste/en/ ) 51 GLOSSARY Airborne infection: The infection usually occurs by the respiratory route, with the agent present in aerosols (infectious particles < 5 \u00b5m in diameter) Airborne precautions: These are additional to standard prec autions and are designed to reduce the transmission of diseases spr ead by the airborne route. Anteroom: As an extra precaution to prevent airborne transmission, some single rooms used for isolation purposes may include an anteroom wher e staff may put on and remove personal protective equipment. Clinical waste : Also known as \"infectious waste\" \u0096 incl udes waste directly associated with blood, body fluids secretions and excretions . It also includes laboratory wast e that is directly associated with specimen processing, huma n tissues, including material or solutions contai ning free-flowing blood, and animal tissue or carcases used for research. Also includes discarded sharps. Cohorting: For infection control pu rposes, if single rooms are not ava ilable or there is a shortage of single rooms, patients infected or colonised with the same orga nisms can be cohorted (sharing of room(s)). When cohorting is used during an outbr eak, these room(s) should be in a well defined area that has been designated for the purpose and is clearly segregated from other pa tient care areas in the health care facility used for non-infected/colonized patients. Contact transmission: Micro-organisms that are transmitted by direct contact with hands/ equipment or indirect contact be tween and infected or colonized patient and a susceptible patient. Contact precautions : These are additional to standard precautions and are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of micro-organi sms by direct or indirect contact. Critical site : Sterile tissue, cavity or bloods tream. Instruments or equipm ent that will penetrate this site must be sterile. Disinfection: A process of removing micro-organism s without complete sterilization. Droplet infections: Large droplets carry the infectious agent (>5 \u00b5m in diameter). Droplet precautions : These are additional to standard precautions and are designed to reduce the transmission of infectious sp read by the droplet route. Health care worker: Any person working in a health care fa cility, for example, medical officer, nurse, physiotherapist, cleaner, psychologist. Health care facility: Organization that employs health care workers and cares for patients/clients. Health care associated infection (also known as nosocomial infection and hospital-associated infection ): An infection acquired in hospital by a patient who was admitted for a reason other than that infection. An infection occurring in a patient in a health care facility in whom the infection was not present or incubating at the time of admission. This include s infections acquired in the hospital but appearing after discharge, and also occupa tional infection among staff of the facility. High-level disinfection: For items classified as critical (entering body cavities or mucous membranes) This will destroy all micro-organism s with the exception of heavy contamination by bacterial spores. GLOSSARY 52 Infection control committee: Provides a forum for multidisciplinary input and cooperation and information sharing. Representation may includ e: management, physicians, other health care workers clinical microbiology, pharmacy, sterili zing service, housekeepi ng, training services. Infection control team: Those health care workers involved in carrying out the day to day infection control programme including the yearly work plan for review by the Infection Control Committee Infection control programme: Incorporates all as pects of infection control, e.g. education, surveillance, environmental management, waste mana gement, outbreak investigation, standard and additional precautions, cleaning, disinfection and st erilization, employee healt h, quality management in infection control. Low-level disinfection: Disinfection for non-critical items can kill most bacteria, some viruses and some fungi, but cannot be relied on to kill more resistant bacteria such as M. tuberculosis or bacterial spores. Multiple resistant organisms: Bacteria that are resistant to many antibiotics. They are more commonly seen in health care facili ties then in the wider communit y. These resistant patterns make them more difficult to treat and they may readily co lonise patients and at times health care workers. Negative pressure room This is a term used for an isolatio n area which receives many air changes per hour (ACH) (> 12 ACH for new construction as of 2001; > 6 ACH for construction before 2001), and is under negative pressure. In other words, th e direction of the air flow is from the outside adjacent space (e.g. the corridor) into the room. It is preferable that the air in a negative pressure room is exhausted to the outside, but it may be r ecirculated if the air is filtered through a high- efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter.6 (For more information see the CDC Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health Care Facilities. MMWR, June 6, 2003/52(RR10);1-42. Also found Also health-care-asso (see above). Personal protective equipment: Includes gloves, gowns, caps, ma sks \u0096 (surgical and N95), and overshoes. These items are used to protect the health care worker from splashes of blood, body fluids, excretions and excretions or from droplets or aerosolization of organisms from the respiratory tract. It is the responsib ility of the health care wo rker to put on the approp riate personal protective equipment in any situation that is likely to l ead to exposure of blood, body fluids, excretions and secretions. Reprocessing : The steps that are taken to make an inst rument or equipment that has been used (contaminated) ready for reuse again. Standard precautions: These are applied for all patients at all times regardless of their known or presumed infectious status. Sterility assurance level: The acceptable level of ster ility is one in a million. This means that of a million products being sterilized by the same method you may statistically expect one of them to be unsterile.3 Sterilization: The destruction of all micro-organisms. Th is is defined as a decrease in microbial load. Sterilization can be either con ducted by physical or chemical means. 53 ACRONYMS BSL Biosafety laboratory CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, USA) CJD Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease HAI Hospital-acquired infection or hospital-associated infection HBV Hepatitis B virus HCF Health care facility HCV Hepatitis C virus HCW Health care workers HEPA High-efficiency particulate air (filters) HICC Hospital Infection Control Committee HIV Human immunodeficiency virus ICP Infection control practitioner ICU Intensive care unit IV Intravenous MDR-TB Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis MRSA Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus PPE Personal protective equipment SARS Severe acute respiratory syndrome SEARO WHO South-East Asia Regional Office SSD Sterilizing service department VHF Viral haemorrhagic fever VRE Vancomycin resistant enterococcus WHO World Health Organization WPRO WHO Western Pacific Regional Office 54 ANNEX 1 - HAND WASHING Appropriate hand washing can minimize micro-or ganisms acquired on the hands by contact with body fluids and contaminated surfaces. Hand washi ng breaks the chain of infection transmission and reduces person-to-person transmission. All health care personnel and fa mily caregivers of patients must practise effective hand washing. Patients and primary care givers need to be instructed in proper t echniques and situations for hand washing. Compliance with hand washing is, however, frequently sub optimal. Reasons for this include, lack of appropriate equipment, low staff to patient ratio s, allergies to hand wash ing products, insufficient knowledge among staff about risks and procedures , the time required, and casual attitudes among staff towards bio-safety. PURPOSE Hand washing helps to remove micro-organisms that might gain entry and cause disease. Washing with soap and water kills many transi ent micro-organisms and allows them to be mechanically removed by rinsing. Washing with antimicrobial products kills or inhibits the growth of micro-organisms in the deep layers. TYPES OF HAND WASHING Hand washing Hand washing is usually limited to hands and wrists ; the hands are washed fo r a minimum of 10 \u0096 15 seconds with soap (plain or antimicrobial) and water. Hand antisepsis/decontamination Hand antisepsis removes or destroys transient micr o-organisms and confers a prolonged effect. It may be carried out in one of the following two ways: Wash hands and forearms with antimicrobial soap and water, for 15-30 seconds (following manufacturer\u0092s in structions). Decontaminate hands with a waterl ess, alcohol-based hand gel or ha nd rub for 15-30 seconds. This is appropriate for hands that are not so iled with protein matter or fat. Hand washing is the simplest and most cost-effective way of preventing the transmission of infection and thus reducing the incidence of health-care-associated infections . ANNEX I : HAND WASHING 55 Immersion of hands in bowls of antiseptics is not recommended. Surgical hand antisepsis Surgical hand antisepsis removes or destroys transient micro-organism s and confers a prolonged effect. The hands and forearms are washed thoroughl y with an antiseptic soap for a minimum of 2-3 minutes. The hands are dried using a sterile towel. Surgical hand antisepsis is required before performing invasive procedures. FACILITIES AND MATERIALS RE QUIRED FOR HAND WASHING Running water Access to clean water is essential. It is preferable to have running water: large washbasins with hand- free controls, which require little mainte nance and have antisplash devices. When no running water is available, use either a buc ket with a tap, which can be turned on and off, a bucket and pitcher, or 60%-90 % alcohol hand rub. Materials used for hand washing/hand antisepsis Soap: Plain or antimicrobial soap depending on the procedure. Plain soap: Used for routine hand washing, availabl e in bar, powder or liquid form. Antimicrobial soap: Used for hand washing as well as hand antisepsis. If bar soaps are used, use small ba rs and soap racks, which drain. Do not allow bar soap to sit in a pool of water Clean dispensers of liquid soap thoroughly every day. When liquid soap containers are empty they mu st be discarded, not refilled with soap solution. Specific antiseptics: recommended hand rubs : with antiseptic and emollient gel and alcohol swabs, which can be applied to clean hands. Dispensers should be placed outside each patient room Alcohol hand-rubs are good for rapid ha nd decontamination between patient contacts. ANNEX 1: H AND WASHING 56 Facilities for drying hands Disposable towels, reusable ster ile single use towels or roll er towels, which are suitably maintained, should be available. If there is no clean dry towel, it is best to air dry hands Equipment and products are not e qually accessible in all countrie s, or health care facilities. Flexibility in products and procedures, and sensitiv ity to local needs will im prove compliance. In all cases, the best procedure po ssible should be instituted. STEPS IN HAND WASHING Preparing for hand washing Remove jewellery (rings, bracelets) and watches before washing hands. Ensure that the nails are clipped s hort (avoid wearing artificial nails). Roll the sleeves up to the elbow. Wet the hands and wrists, keeping hands and wrists lower than the elbows (permits the water to flow to the fingertips, avoiding arm contamination). Apply soap (plain or antimi crobial) and lather thoroughly. Use firm, circular motions to wash the hands and arms up to the elbows, c overing all areas including palms, back of the hands, fingers, between fingers and lateral side of fift h finger, knuckles, wrists and forearms. Rub for minimum of 10-15 seconds. Repeat the process if the hands are very soiled. Clean under the fingernails. Rinse hands thoroughly, keeping the hands lower than the forearms. If running water is not availabl e, use a bucket and pitcher. Do not dip your hands into a bowl to ri nse, as this recontaminates them. Collect used water in a basin and di scard in a sink, drain or toilet. Dry hands thoroughly with autoclaved napkins or dis posable sterile paper towel, clean dry towel, or air-dry them. Discard the towel (if used) in an appropriate c ontainer without touching the bin lids with hand. Use a paper towel, clean towel or your elbow/foot to turn off the fau cet to prevent recontamination. Common towels must not be used. ANNEX I : HAND WASHING 57 A general procedure for hand washing is given in Figure 1. USING ANTISEPTICS, HAND RUBS, GELS OR ALCOHOL SWABS FOR HAND ANTISEPSIS Apply the product to the palm of one hand. Th e volume needed to apply varies by product. Rub hands together, covering all surfaces of hands and fingers, until hands are dry. Do not rinse. Note: When there is visible soiling of hands, they should first be wash ed with soap and water before using waterless hand rubs, ge ls or alcohol swabs. If soap and water are unavailable, hands should first be cleansed with detergent-containing towellettes, before using the alc ohol-based hand rub, gel or swab. 58 ANNEX 2 - PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT IF FULL PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQ UIPMENT NEEDS TO BE WORN BEFORE ENTERING THE PATIENT CARE AREA There has been much debate about the order for putting on and taking o ff personal protective equipment. The order for putting on personal pr otective equipment is not important, however for practicality, the following sequence is given as an example when full personal protective equipment is worn: Wash hands. Wear scrub suit or old set of thin clothes be fore entering the designated changing room or area. Wear boots /or shoe covers w ith trousers tucked inside. Wash hands. Wear cap. Wear the mask. Wear an impermeable apron if necessary. Wear the gown. Wear protective eye wear/ goggles. Wash hands and dry them. Wear gloves with gown sleeve cuff tucked into glove. REMOVING PERSONAL PR OTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WHEN LEAVING THE PATIENT CARE AREA The order in which personal protective equipment is removed is not as important as the principle behind choosing such an order. The key princi ple is that when removing personal protective equipment the wearer should avoid contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions and other contaminants. When hands become contaminated they should be washed or decontaminated with 70% alcohol solution. An example of how to remove personal protective equipment is given. Using gloved hands, untie the gown string if tied in front and remove shoe covers. Remove gloves (fingers under cuff of second glove to avoid contact between skin and outside of gloves) and discard in an appropriate manner. Wash hands. Remove gown and apron, without contaminating clothing underneath. Touch only inside of gown and apron while removing. Place in appropriate disposal bag. ANNEX 2: P ERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 59 Remove goggles, mask, and cap and place in an appropriate container. Dispose according to the health care facility protocol. Remove boots (if worn) and place in appropriate container. Wash hands up to elbows thoroughly with soap and water, dry or d econtaminate in 70% alcohol before leaving facility. USE OF FULL PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Boots/shoe covers Boots/shoe covers are used to pr otect the wearer from splashes of blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions. Waterproof boots should be worn for heavily co ntaminated, wet flooring and floor cleaning. Selecting boots/shoe covers Shoe covers should be disposable and waterproof Waterproof boots should be washable Wearing boots/shoe covers Wear waterproof boots if needed or wear shoe covers over your personal shoe s so as to cover your shoes adequately. Removing boots/ shoe covers Remove shoe covers first with gloved hands and discard. Remove boots last, before leavi ng the room and decontaminate Wash hands thoroughly. Example of health care worker wearing full personal protective equipment Shoe covers ANNEX 2: P ERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 60 Caps Caps that completely cover the hair are used when splashes of blood and body fluids are expected. They should protect the hair from aerosols that may otherwise lodge on the hair and be transferred to other parts of the health care work er such as face or clothing by th e hands or onto inanimate objects. Selecting cap Use a disposable, waterproof cap of an appropr iate size which completely covers the hair Wearing cap Wear before masking. Place or tie cap over the head so as to cover hair adequately. Removing cap Remove cap after removing mask. Remove by holding inside of the cap and folding inside out. Discard in proper container Wash hands immediately. Masks A surgical mask protects health care providers from inhaling respiratory pathogens transmitted by the droplet route. It prevents th e spread of infectious diseases such as varicella (chickenpox) and meningococcal diseases (meningococcal meningitis). An N95 mask protects health care providers from inhaling respiratory pathoge ns that are transmitted via the airborne route. This helps to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as TB, MDR-TB and SARS. In order to prevent the spread of infection, the appropriate mask should be worn by health care providers and visitors when attending to a pati ent suffering from a communicable disease that is spread via the airborne or droplet route. A patient with a communicable disease spread vi a the droplet or airborne route should wear a surgical mask when being transferre d to other departments or hospitals. Disposable masks are for single us e only and should be discarded after 4-6 hours use. They should not be stored in bags and re-used, shared or hung around neck, etc. If a mask is splashed wet, it should be changed using clean gl oves and strict hand washing. Example of health care worker wearing cap Hair cover / cap ANNEX 2: P ERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 61 Selecting a mask A surgical mask should be chosen to be worn in circumstances where there ar e likely to be splashes of blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions or when the patient has a communicable disease that is spread via the droplet route An N95 respirator mask needs to be chosen for those circumstances when a patient has a communicable disease that is spread via the airborne route A mask with a higher level of filtration may be required when dealing with highly transmissible diseases such a viral haemorrhagic fever, when conducting high risk procedures on a patient with SARS. Wearing the mask Wash hands and dry. Remove the clean mask from the container with clean hands. Ensure the mask is fitted properly. Each N95 mask/respirator is different and must be appropriately fitted to each health care worker\u0096 called a \"fit test\". Health care workers must ensure they know how to properly fit a respirator according to the manufacturers instructions. If glasses are worn, fit the upper edge of the ma sk under the glasses. This will help to prevent them from clouding over. A secure fit will pr event both the escape and the inhalation of microorganisms around the edges of the mask and fogging of the eyeglasses. Precautions Avoid talking, sneezing, or coughing if possible. Masks cannot be worn with beards/unshaven faces. Type of mask When to wear Comments N95 SARS, open/active pulmonary TB, pneumonic plague Ideally recommended; but single-use, cost and continuous availability may restrict the use. In such situations, standard surgical masks may be used P100 and N100 During invasive procedures, collection of respiratory secretions, laboratory work and work in an environment where organisms in concentrated form may be encountered Ideally recommended; but the fact that filters need to be kept continuously available and can be used only once, may mean that cost considerations restrict their use. In such situations, standard surgical masks may be used. Standard surgical splash proof masks (not gauze mask) Mainly when dealing with droplet infections use for airborne infections when N95 masks are not available Use three/four layers, if used to ensure effective filtration of microorganisms. May be used for one hour only. Discard after one use. The mask should completely s eal the face at all times to ensure effective filtering of micro-organisms ANNEX 2: P ERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 62 For more information about respiratory masks see: http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/ respirators/respsars.html Removing the mask Wash hands and remove mask keeping outside of the mask in, handle only the strings. Discard in an appropriate bag/ container and seal the bag. Wash hands. Apron An apron protects the wearer and the uniform from contact with the contaminated body fluids. Plastic aprons are used over the gown when caring for patients where possible splashes with blood and body substances may occur. Need not be used if the gown is of impermeable material. Selecting the apron Select water repellent, plastic aprons, which are disposable If disposable ones are not available then reusable plastic aprons can be used. Size: long enough to protect th e uniform and the gown but should not touch the ground. Should cover the front and sides. It should open in the back. A tie around the waist keeps the apron in place. Wearing the apron Wash hands. Ensure that the sleeves are rolled above the elbows before putting on the apron. Wear the apron over the uniform an d tie around the waist at the back. Removing the apron Wash hands and dry. Remove touching only the inside part of apron. Discard folding the outside part in. Decontaminate or dispose according to the health care facility guidelines Wash hands thoroughly before touching anything else. Examples of different types of N95 masks ANNEX 2: P ERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 63 Example of gown Gown Gowns made of impervious material are worn to protect the wearer \u0092s clothing/uniform from possible contamination with micro-organisms and exposure to blood, body fluids secr etions and excretions. The gown should be used only once for one patient a nd discarded or sent fo r laundering. Health care workers should remove gowns before leaving the unit. Selecting a gown Gowns should be clean and non-sterile. The gown s hould be impervious and water repellent. It should be long enough to cover the clothing of the wearer and should have long sleeves and high neck. Disposable gowns are preferable. If they ar e not available, cotton reus able gowns can be used with a plastic apron underneath. Wearing the gown Wash hands, and dry. Hold the gown at the neck on the inside permitting to unfold. Slide hands and arms down the sleeves. Fasten the ties at the neck. Overlap the gown at the back as much as possible and secure the waistband. Request assistance to fasten the neck and the waist ties. Removing the gown Remove the gown after removing gloves. Untie the waist-band with a gloved hand if it is tied in front before removing the gloves. Remove gloves and wash hands. Untie the neck-ties (be sure not to touch outside of the gown). Slide the gown down the arms and over the ha nds by holding in inside of the sleeves. Hold the gown with both the hands (insid e the shoulders) at the shoulder seams. Turn the gown inside out (contaminated side in ). The hands are then brought together and the gown is rolled and discarded in the container provided. The inside of the apron is considered clean, the outside is consideredcontaminated. The neck of the apron is considered clean because that part isnot touched with contaminated hands. ANNEX 2: P ERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 64 Discard appropriately. If reusable - discard if visibly contaminated. If there is shortage of gowns they may be reused during one shift for the same patient. Hang gown with outside facing in when not in use. Discard at the end of each shift. Wash hands thoroughly before touching anything else. Protective eyewear/goggles Protective eyewear/goggles should be worn at a ll times during patient contact when there is a possibility that a patient\u0092s body fluids may splash or spray onto the caregive r\u0092s face/eyes (e.g. during throat, endotracheal and tracheost omy suctioning, removal of indwe lling catheter etc). The amount of exposure can be reduced through the use of protect ive eyewear. Full face shields may also be used to protect the eyes and mouth of the health care worker in such high-risk situations. Ordinary spectacles do not provide adequate pr otection, although caregivers may wear their own glasses with extra protection added at the side s. Goggles that fit over glasses are available. Protective eyewear should be changed after each shift. Protective eyewear should be washed and decont aminated after removal and in between use. Selecting protective eyewear Goggles should be made of clear polycarbonate pl astic with side and forehead shields. These should be optically clear, antifog and distortion-free. Goggles that fit over glasses are also available. Disposable goggl es are preferred but reusable ones can be used after cleaning and decontamination. Wearing protective eye wear Wear the eyewear by securing it over the bridge of the nose and also over the mask. Removing protective eye wear Remove and place in appropriate co ntainer for cleaning and decontamin ation prior to reuse by next person. Goggles /Eye protection Remove a soiled gown as promptly as po ssible and wash hands immediately to avoid transfer of micro-organisms to other patients or environments ANNEX 2: P ERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 65 Gloves Use gloves when there is poten tial exposure to blood, body fluid, excretions or secretions. Change gloves between patients, between ta sks and procedures on the same patient, and when they become soiled. Remove gloves promptly after touching contaminated items and environmental surfaces and before moving to another patient. Remove gloves before leaving the patient\u0092s bedside and decontaminate hands immediately. After glove removal and hand washing ensu re that hands do not touch potentially contaminated environmental surfaces or items in the patient\u0092s room. Discard gloves after attending to each patient. Selecting gloves Use disposable gloves that are: clean/non-sterile for routine care of the infectious patients; sterile for invasive procedures. Use heavy-duty rubber gloves for cleaning instrume nts, handling soiled linen or dealing with spills of blood and body fluids. They can be washed and reused. Choose gloves that fit properly. Check there is no puncture in gloves. Do not us e gloves if they are torn, as punctured gloves do not provide protection. Wearing gloves Wash hands and dry them. Pick up the first glove by its cuff. Wear the first glove. Bunch the glove up and then pull it onto the hand; ease fingers into the glove. Repeat for the other hand. Clean, non-sterile, disposable, single u se gloves are recommended for routine care of patients with highl y transmissible infections. The reuse of single-use gloves is not recommended. ANNEX 2: P ERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 66 Removing gloves When removing personal protective equipment, remove gloves first. Grasp the outside of one glove, near the cuff, w ith the thumb and forefinger of the other hand. Pull the glove off, turning it inside out while pulling and holding it in the hand that is still gloved.

CISOLATION WASH/TOILET General Principles of isolation unit AB D DA A E E 70 ANNEX 6 - INFECTION CONTROL ADVICE TO CONTACTS OF SUSPECT OR PROBABLE SARS CASES For contacts of suspect or pr obable SARS patients, careful ha nd hygiene is urged, including hand washing with soap and water. If hands are not vi sibly soiled, alcohol-based hand rubs may be used as an alternative to hand washing. Fo r the safety of others, you should: Ensure that all household members carefully follow good hand hygiene (e.g. frequent hand washing or use of alcohol-based hand rubs), particularly after contact with body fluids (e.g. respiratory secretions, urine, or faeces). Pursue normal activities but isolat e yourself quickly if you devel op a fever or feel unwell, and seek medical attention. KNOWN EXPOSURE TO A CASE If you have been exposed to a case you need to m onitor your health for 10 days after exposure. You should take your temperature daily (see below) and report by phone to the infection control practitioner in your health facility. Infection control guidelines for hous ehold contacts living with a case Persons with suspect or probable SARS may have a moderate illness that can be managed with home isolation. In this instance household members need to ensure infection control pro cedures are strictly adhered to. People with probable SARS need to ensure they do not pass the infection to others in the home. If they have ongoing respiratory symptoms they should sleep in separate rooms, wear surgical mask when in a room with others, ha ve their own eating utensils and not share any linen or towels with others. Eating utensils, towels, and bedding can be used by others after routine cleaning. Used tissues should be discar ded into the toilet or a plastic bag into the rubbish. SARS patients with respiratory symptoms, should wear surgical masks, if tolerated. If the patient is unable to tolerate a mask, house hold members should wear N95 masks when in close contact with the person. All household members should carefully fo llow good hand hygiene (e.g. frequent hand washing or use of alcohol-based hand rubs), particularly after contact with body fluids (e.g. respiratory secretions, urine, or faeces), and c over their mouths and noses with a facial tissue when coughing or sneezing. Environmental surfaces should be cleaned w ith warm water and detergent, followed by wiping with a household disinfectant, eg. d iluted bleach (following the manufacturer's instructions). Household members or other close contacts of SARS patients who develop fever or respiratory symptoms should see a doctor. Wh en possible, in advance of the evaluation, ANNEX 6: I NFECTION CONTROL ADVICE TO CONTACTS OF SUSPECTS OR PROBABLE SARS C ASES 71 health care providers should be informed that the individual is a clos e contact of a possible SARS patient. If they do not experience fever or respirat ory symptoms, household members or other close contacts of SARS patients need not limit their activities outside the home. The exception to this is where the contact with the SA RS case was in a SARS-affected area. How to record your body temperature: follow these instructions carefully To ensure accurate measurement of your te mperature, do not take your temperature for 30 mins after having a cold drink 30 mins after having a hot drink 30 mins after having a hot shower or bath 30 mins after exercising 30 mins after smoking, and do not take Aspirin, Panadol or Panadeine for 4 hours pr ior to taking temperature Using a digital thermometer: see opposite Press on/off button Wait until thermometer resets and beeps Place tip under the tongue, wait until the thermometer beeps Record the temperature and the time it was taken Using a mercury thermometer: see below Hold the thermometer firmly by the top and shake downwards firmly Shake the thermometer till the mercury level falls back to the bulb reservoir Place the thermometer bulb under the tongue and l eave in place for 4 minutes (monitor with the second hand on a clock) Record the temperature and the time it was taken Remember - contact the appropriate SARS contac t person/s if your temperature is 37.5\u00b0C or above 72 ANNEX 7 - INFECTION CONTROL CHECKLIST DISCHARGE OF A PATIENT WITH SUSPECT OR PROBABLE SEVERE ACUTE RESPI RATORY SYNDROME (SARS) Before the patient is discharged, ensure that the following have been attended to: T h e p a t i e n t T i c k 1. The patient has been informed of any follow-up blood tests required (when, where and given contact numbers) 2. The patient has been given the patie nt information sheet for SARS and has been educated accordingly 3. The patient is aware that a member of the SARS team will be making regular contact with him or her 4. The patient has been educated as to what the infection control precautions are in the home situation. For example: (a) Whenever he or she has contact with another person he or she must wear a surgical mask or the contact must wear an N95 mask (b) The patient should remain at home for the duration required 5. The patient has been educated on how to take his or her temperature twice daily 6. The patient has been given a supply of surgical masks and has been advised where to obtain further masks from ANNEX 7: I NFECTION CONTROL CHECKLIST 73 The patient's family/contacts 1. The patient's family/contacts have b een given the information sheet for contacts of a patient with SA RS and educated accordingly 2. The patient's family/contacts have b een advised of the infection control precautions for living with/having cont act with a patient with SARS (e.g. to wear the N95 mask when in contact with the patient if the patient is not able to wear a surgical mask, the patient should remain at home for the duration required) 3. The patient's family/contacts have been educated on how to wear the N95 mask. 4. The patient's family/contacts have been given a supply of N95 masks and advised where more masks can be obtained 5. The patient's family/contacts have been advised that a member of the SARS team will be in contact with them. 74 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Many members of the SARS teams at the South-Ea st Asia and Western Pacific Regional Offices contributed to these guidelines. The first few drafts of the document we re developed and/or reviewed by: Dr Manju Vatsa Dr Rob Condon Ms Michelle Cullen Ms Penny Clayton Ms Glenys Harrington Ms Peta-Anne Zimmerman The document was further developed following a m eeting in Manesar, Haryana, in August 2003. The participants at that meeting were: Ms Karen Shaw Dr Duangvadee Sungkhobol Dr Rohini Dr Mel Velmonte WHO gratefully acknowledges the c ontribution of the many people who played a part in developing these guidelines, as well as the ma ny infection control experts in c ountries of the South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions who re viewed them and made valuable suggestions. In particular, thanks are due to Dr Luis Diaz for his advice on environmental management and to Dr Philippe Calain for his advice regarding cleaning the envi ronment and reprocessing of instruments and equipment for highly transmissible diseases in resour ce-poor areas. Dr Calain's extensive experience working with viral haemorrhagic fever (Ebola) patients in Africa proved very helpful in the development of these guidelines. "}
