Acknowledgments ............................................................................................................. 55 General Overview General Overview 1Connecticut Mandated Health Insurance Benefits Reviews 2010 Executive Summary The Connecticut General Assembly, in Public Act 09-179, directed the Connecticut Insurance Department (Department) to review and evaluate all mandated health insurance benefits in effect in Connecticut as of January 1, 2009. It also directed the Department to contract with the University of Connecticut Center for Public Health and Health Policy (Center) to perform the review and evaluation. The Center reviewed forty- five health insurance benefit mandates that met the statutory definition in P .A. 09-179. The findings of these reviews are contained in Volumes I through IV of this report. These reviews should be read in conjunction with the reports of the consulting actuarial firm, Ingenix Consulting, that are attached to the General Over - view and to each volume. The statutory citation, brief description and effective dates, and the volume in which the review on each mandate is found are shown in Tables 1 and 2 of the General Overview, and the impact on premium of each mandate is shown in Table 3, below. The estimated medical cost, retention cost (administrative costs plus profit) and cost-sharing of each mandate are shown in Appendices One (group coverage) and Three (individ - ual coverage) of the Ingenix Consulting Summary Report, attached to the General Overview as Appendix II. The percentages of members of self-funded plans who have equivalent benefits are shown for each mandate in Appendix Five of the Ingenix Consulting Summary Report. The health insurance benefit mandates in effect in Connecticut on January 1, 2009 account for roughly 22 percent of total premium for group coverage and 18 percent of total premium for individual coverage. Five mandates (tumors and leukemia, mental health, psychotropic drugs, diabetes diagnosis and treatment, and newborn coverage) account for 12 percent of premium for group coverage. The next five highest mandates in terms of premium impact (colorectal cancer screening, off-label use of cancer drugs, infertility, mammog - raphy and chiropractors) account for five percent of total premium for group coverage. The remaining 35 mandates account for five percent of group premium. Several of the remaining mandates have little or no impact on premiums, either because the services they mandate are very low cost or because they are accessed by a very small number of members, or both. Some high-cost services are accessed by such a small percentage of the members that the overall impact on premium is relatively small. Some of the man - dates specify minimum dollar amounts of coverage that have been far outstripped by medical inflation since the mandates were enacted. As a result, these mandates have limited impact on premium. The total estimated cost to the State plans for these mandates is $129,699,193. The State plan estimates for each mandate are shown in Appendix Four, column four of the Ingenix Consulting Summary Report. The estimated cost to the State plans includes a calculation for those members in retiree plans who do not participate in Medicare. It should be noted that this estimated cost is calculated using weighted averages for all claims paid by Connecticut-domiciled insurers and health maintenance organizations in the State. The actual cost of these mandates to the State plans may be higher or lower, based on the actual benefit design of the State plans and the demographics of the covered lives (e.g., level of cost-sharing, average age of members, etc.). These reviews do not attempt to assess the impact of the recently enacted federal Patient Protection and Af - fordable Care Act, since that was beyond the scope of P .A. 09-179. However, the reviews may provide use - ful information to Connecticut policymakers as they begin to plan for implementation of the federal health care reform.General Overview General Overview 2General Overview General Overview 3Connecticut Mandated Health Insurance Benefits Reviews 2010 General Overview Introduction In June 2009, the Connecticut General Assembly enacted P .A. 09-179, which, in part, directs the Connecticut Insurance Department (CID) to evaluate health insurance benefits mandated to be included in fully-insured group and individual health insurance policies issued, delivered or amended in Connecticut as of January 1, 2009. The statute sets out 25 criteria to be addressed in the evaluations of each mandated benefit. The criteria are divided into the social and the financial impacts of the mandates. This legislation is similar in some respects to that enacted in 30 other states. Public Act 09-179 directs the CID to contract with the University of Connecticut Center for Public Health and Health Policy (CPHHP) to perform the reviews and authorizes the CID to assess the costs of the review to the insurance companies and managed care organizations doing business in Connecticut. It also authorizes the CID and the University to contract for whatever outside services may be needed to complete the evaluations. P .A. 09-179 is included with this introduction as Appendix I. The CID entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the University of Connecticut to utilize the services of the CPHHP in August 2009 to complete the reviews as described in the statute. CID also contracted with Ingenix Consulting (IC) of Rocky Hill, Connecticut to perform actuarial and economic analyses for the reviews. This contract was issued pursuant to a competitive bidding process completed in 2009 that also included the provision of actuarial services for the evaluation of seven proposed mandates for the Insurance and Real Estate Committee in the fall of 2009, pursuant to subsection (a) of P .A. 09-179. Mandate identification The CPHHP formed a working group of CPHHP researchers, CID actuarial and legal personnel and IC representatives to identify and evaluate the health insurance mandates that met the definition of \"mandated benefit\" included in P .A. 09-179. Section 1(a)(2) of act defines \"mandated benefit\" as follows: \"Mandated health benefit\" means an existing statutory obligation of, or proposed legislation that would require, an insurer, health care center, hospital service corporation, medical service corporation, fraternal benefit society or other entity that offers individual or group health insurance or medical or health care benefits plan in this state to: (A) permit an insured or enrollee to obtain health care treatment or services from a particular type of health care provider; (B) offer or provide coverage for the screening, diagnosis or treatment of a particular disease or General Overview General Overview 4condition; or (C) offer or provide coverage for a particular type of health care treatment or service, or for medical equipment, medical supplies or drugs used in connection with a health care treatment or service. \"Mandated health benefit\" includes any proposed legislation to expand or repeal an existing statutory obligation relating to health insurance coverage or medical benefits. (P .A. 09-179, eff. July 1, 2009) Forty-five existing health insurance mandates meet this definition and were in effect on January 1, 2009. Most of them apply to both individual and group policies; however, a few apply only to group or only to individual policies. Mandates which regulate underwriting policies or financial or reporting requirements of insurers were not included in this study because they fall outside the definition of \"Mandated health benefit\" in P .A. 09-179. Review organization For purposes of organization and work flow, the work group divided the 45 mandates into four groups. Claims data requests to insurers and managed care organizations (MCOs) were based on these groupings, as are the IC actuarial reports. For ease of reference, this study is organized into four volumes, one for each group of mandates, and this General Overview. The General Overview includes a discussion of the process developed to carry out the mandate reviews and the major findings on all existing mandates. It also includes a listing of all the mandates, with statutory reference, title and volume in which the review of each is found (Tables 1 and 2). The Ingenix Consulting Summary Report of its actuarial findings is attached to this General Overview as Appendix II. Volume I includes an introduction to eleven mandates that require health insurers and health care plans to cover specific diseases or conditions and the individual reviews for those mandates. The Ingenix Consulting report that covers set one is attached as an appendix to Volume I. Volume II includes an introduction to eleven mandates that cover services to certain populations, i.e., women's and children's services and the individual reviews for those mandates. The Ingenix Consulting report that covers set two is attached as an appendix to Volume II. Volume III includes an introduction to ten mandates that cover mental health and substance abuse services and the services of specific types of health care providers and the individual reviews for those mandates. The Ingenix Consulting report that covers set three is attached as an appendix to Volume III. Volume IV includes an introduction to thirteen mandates for which there was limited claims data available, as well as miscellaneous mandates that were not included in the other groups, along with the individual reviews for those mandates. The Ingenix Consulting report that covers set four is attached as an appendix to Volume IV. Each mandate review is written as a stand alone chapter, with all the information on that mandate contained within it. They are meant to be read in conjunction with the Ingenix Consulting Actuarial Report for the respective volume and the Ingenix Consulting Summary Report, which is attached to this General Overview as an appendix.General Overview General Overview 5Claims data With the assistance of the CID, the working group developed a format for requesting claims data from the six insurers/managed care organizations (MCOs) domiciled in Connecticut and subject to CID regulation. These insurers/MCOs account for approximately 90 percent of the Connecticut population covered by fully insured health insurance policies issued in Connecticut. The working group requested claims data related to each mandated benefit for calendar years 2007 and 2008 for both individual policies and group contracts from each insurer/MCO. In addition, Ingenix Consulting reviewed claims data in its own proprietary databases as a comparison for and to augment the claims data submitted by the carriers. The insurers/MCOs submitted both total cost data and data on a per member per month (PMPM) basis, which is the common practice for purposes of reporting costs in the health insurance industry. The \"per member\" refers to all lives covered by the health insurance policy. This includes the insured and any family members or other persons included in the insured's coverage. Most cost and financial impact data in the study are reported on a PMPM basis. Research methods Under the direction of CPHHP , medical librarians at the Lyman Maynard Stowe Library at the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC) gathered published articles and other information related to medical, social, economic, and financial aspects of the required benefit. CPHHP staff also conducted independent literature searches using similar search terms to those used by the UCHC medical librarians. Where available, articles published in peer-reviewed journals are cited to support the analyses. In addition, CPHHP staff consulted with faculty from the University of Connecticut and University of Connecticut Health Center, as well as with community providers, on matters pertaining to medical standards of care; traditional, current and emerging practices; and evidence-based medicine related to the benefits. Staff gathered additional information through telephone and e-mail inquiries to appropriate state, federal, municipal, and non-profit entities and from internet sources such as the State of Connecticut website, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) website, the websites of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, other states' websites, the National Council of State Legislatures website, professional organizations' websites, and non-profit and community-based organization websites. Each review is based on this research and the actuarial and economic analysis provided by Ingenix Consulting. General discussion The amount of information available varied tremendously among the mandates. Some mandates are common throughout the states. Others are found only in Connecticut or a few other states. In some cases the language is somewhat standardized among the states. In others, the language, the covered services and/or the dollar amounts vary widely. Some conditions have been researched extensively, both the medical science and the economic impact. Others have relatively little research associated with them. The reviews strive to give an accurate reflection of the available data and research on each mandate. These reviews are a retrospective review of the existing Connecticut health insurance benefit mandates as of January 1, 2009. (Mandates which were not effective as of that date are not included, pursuant to P .A. 09-179.) As the Ingenix Consulting Summary Report points out, these reviews are not an evaluation of General Overview General Overview 6the value or utility of any of these mandates. Each review is an objective review of the medical science and standard of care associated with the mandated service, the estimated cost and impact on insurance premiums of the mandate, and the social and financial impacts of the mandate. It is important to keep in mind that state health insurance benefit mandates only apply to fully insured health insurance policies and plans. They are not applicable to self-funded plans, which are governed by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Only about 40 percent of Connecticut residents are covered under fully insured group or individual health insurance plans or policies. Many of these mandates have been in effect for many years, some for decades. The legislative history shows that some of the insurers/MCOs covered some of the mandated benefits in their plans even before the mandate was adopted. Thus it is difficult to currently assess the cost that these mandates may have added to premiums when they were enacted. The new cost that was added by the mandate is now embedded in total premium and is not easily identifiable at this point. In some cases, the medical standard of care has changed since the adoption of the mandate and aligns much more closely now with the requirements of the mandate than it did at the time of the mandate's adoption, e.g. the diabetes treatment and self-management education mandates. In other cases, the dollar amount specified in the mandate has not been changed since the mandate was enacted and may be irrelevant now, e.g. the tumors and leukemia mandate. In the case of the mandate for coverage of off-label drugs for cancer treatment, two of the external references specified in the mandate no longer exist. Some of the benefits are also mandated by the federal government for employer-sponsored health plans. These federal mandates apply to all employer plans irrespective of the Connecticut mandate. In light of these variables, it is difficult to assess whether the removal of a given mandate at this point would have any effect on premiums, or whether the service would continue to be covered by most plans, even in the absence of the state mandate. Indeed, many of the mandates are included in the majority of self-funded plans, which are not subject to state regulation. The reviews provide an estimated cost to the State employee health plans for each mandate, including a calculation for those members of the retiree plans who do not participate in Medicare. These costs are based on the assumption that the State plans will continue to include all of the Connecticut mandated benefits, even though the State plans are now self-funded and are not required to comply with state mandates. It should be noted that the estimated cost to the State plans is calculated using the same weighted averages for all claims paid by Connecticut-domiciled insurers/MCOs as was used for the other cost calculations. The actual cost of the mandates to the State plans may be higher or lower, based on the actual benefit design of the State plans and the demographics of the covered lives (e.g., level of cost-sharing, average age of members, etc.). Finally, these reviews do not attempt to assess the impact of the recently enacted federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, since that was beyond the scope of P .A. 09-179. However, the reviews may provide useful information to Connecticut policymakers as they begin to plan for implementation of the federal health care reform.General Overview General Overview 7Table 1 -

INTRODUCTION: This summary report serves to record the finding s of Ingenix Consulting (IC) pursuant to the engagement to provide actuarial services to the State of CT in conjunction with Substitute House Bill No. 5021, Public Acts 09-179. This summary follows four prior reports on the mandates covered by Sets One through Four respectively. It is intended only to provide overarching comments on the project. The four reports cover each set of mandates far more thoroughly. In order to follow this summary, it is first necessary to read the four reports. IC was retained by the state to assess 45 existing health insurance mandates. The mandates were reviewed with respect to cost, socio-economic impact, and effect on the system for the finance and delivery of health care. Most of the mandates were for particular benefits; others require the coverage of certain types of providers. No eligibility mandates were reviewed. Rating regulations, which do not meet the definition of mandate used for this project, were not included in this study. IC partnered with a workgroup that included individuals from the UConn Center for Public Health and Health Policy as well the CT Insurance Department. The work of IC is contained in these four reports and this overarching summary. A thorough and systematic evaluation of the value and utility of the mandates was not within the scope of this project. The four reports and this summary are intended to present quantitative and qualitative facts and actuarial judgments about the 45 mandates. Different stakeholders will perceive these points from diverse perspectives. For this project, the six health insurers domiciled in CT were asked to submit their claim data showing how much these mandates cost in 2007 and 2008. For some of the mandates, IC also supplemented the health carrier data with data from their CT and national databases. Costs were determined with respect to the insurers and people insured. Medical costs were analyzed for each mandate, as were non-medical costs. Interviews were conducted with many medical providers who shared their expertise on the conditions, illness, and diseases covered by the mandates. Costs were analyzed for the mandates in existence in 2009. These were projected to 2010 for fully insured group plans in CT. A subsequent cost study was conducted to establish cost projections from 2011 through 2014. These are shown in the appendices to this summary. This summary also addresses mandate coverage by self-funded plans in CT since this was not addressed in the four prior reports. Self-funded plans are outside of the regulatory scope of state mandates; however, most self-funded employer plans cover most of the mandates. Many of the mandates have been in existenc e for a decade or decades. The oldest mandates came about at a time when health insurance contracts were more limited with respect to the scope of covered benefits. At that time, there were different types of health insurance such as combinations of a basic hospital plan and an ov erlaying supplemental major medical policy. These plans may have excluded mental health and substance abuse services, as well as the services of physical, speech, and occupational therapists. Neither did these plans cover \"orphan\" diseases. These are usually inherited m edical conditions that affect a very small percentage of the population. Many have been discovered in the past few decades, such as the detrimental effect that cancer treatment may have on a child's brain development. Although these diseases affect only a small vulnerable subpopulation, the mandate may 328 Appendix II. relieve a sig nificant cost burden on those families coping with these diseases. Over time, health insurance plans have evolved to cover a broader range of medical goods and services. While some critics blame mandates for the rise in health insurance premiums, others perceive a number of other factors, such as the marc h of medical technology and advancements in the general practice of medicine. Some cite the progress in medicine and health care as one of the reasons behind the existence of many m andates. Regardless, consumers of health insurance are protected by mandates. It is ne cessary to examine each mandate on its own in order to understand its origin, benefit, and cost. In some cases, by imposing a benefit or provider mandate, the state creates a level playing field for all the various HMOs and health insurers. In this sense, sometimes subtle inequities in coverage can be addressed when all carriers must cover the same minimum established by the mandate. Several mandates had internal dollar limits. These are: hearing aids for children, ostomy supplies, birth to three, accidental ingestion of controlled drugs, and aspects of the cancer mandate. Over time, these dollar limits may become outdated due to the effects of inflation. The evolution of medical technology may also contribute to dollar limits becoming outdated. The process of establishing these various costs for the 45 mandates involved some actuarial calculation and judgment. The carrier data was not 100% reliable, and some carriers had difficulty securing data for some mandates. All the carriers had difficulty obtaining data for a few. Ingenix Consulting data was used to supplement the carrier data. In some cases, costs were established using incidence and prevalence rates obtained from the medical literature. The list of mandates varies considerably from state to state. In examining CT's mandates relative to other states, it is apparent that CT is not first or last in number of mandates covered, but toward the higher end of the list. What is striking is the variance of mandates covered from state to state and the lack of consistency. This may reflect the local political process through which mandates arise, and the state-based nature of insurance regulation. II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In the course of this study, IC examined not only the costs, but also many of the socio- economic implications of the 45 mandates. It is clear that many of them add to the cost of health insurance. Most are also an important part of health coverage at this time. Some mandates protect a small but vulnerable special population with a medical condition that affects few people. At the other end of the spectrum, other mandates, such as those pertaining to preventive care, affect all insured people and serve to promote the overall health of the entire insured population. The reports focused primarily on fully insured Group plans. It also comments on Individual plans. The Group plans are further segmented into small group and large group; the majority of those insured by group plans are in large group, defined as more than 50 employees. The 45 mandates in this report comprise roughly 22% of the 2010 medical cost of health insurance in CT for the average person covered by a group plan. This is the medical cost paid by insurers and does not include the cost paid by the member in the form of deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. This percentage, 22%, likely overstates the true medical cost of the mandates for several reasons. Some of the benef its required by the mandates were already covered prior to the passage of the mandate. The cost of other mandates may also be 429 Appendix II.overstated for other reasons. The p sychotropic drugs mandate, for example, requires health insurers to cover only the most effective psychotropic drug, but insurers reported the total cost of all psychotropic drugs. In other cases, the insurance carriers may have erred on the safe side and captured more claims for a particular mandate than the mandate requires. There is also some minor overlap in the covered services of several mandates. There are three general categories of cost that were examined in the course of this project: Medical cost paid by insurers, Non-medical expenses paid by insurers, and Member Cost-Sharing, the responsibility of the insured person. The 22% reported above is medical cost paid by insurers. In conjunction with this medical cost, there is an associated non-medical expense paid by the insurer. This is sometimes referred to as \"retention\" in the four reports. It includes administrative (operational) expense as well as a risk/profit charge. Embedded in the administrative cost is the expense for premium tax; this charge is 1.75% of premium, and carriers must pay it to the state for all fully-insured plans. Non-benefit expense for Group plans is about 16.7% of premium; this is about 20% of the medical cost, where medical cost is 83.3% of premium. These 45 mandates are responsible for 22% of the total medical cost of Group health plans. Similarly, with non- medical expense included, the cost of the 45 mandates is 22% of the total health insurance premium for group plans, since the retention app lying to the mandates is the same percentage applying to all medical expenses. The third category of cost is member cost-sharing. These amounts are paid when people use their insurance and seek medical care. They consist of deductibles, coinsurance, and copays and are paid at or after the time of service. For group plans, the member cost-sharing associated with the 45 mandates is about 17% of the medical cost of the mandates. This is somewhat higher than the overall member cost-sharing for all medical care, which is about 15% of total medical cost. In addition to cost-sharing, those with group health coverage often have financial responsibility for a portion of the annual premium ranging from about 10% to 50%. On average, this is roughly in the vicinity of 25% in CT. Empl oyers usually obtain these funds through payroll withholding. The portion of the premium paid by those in group plans is not considered part of the member cost-sharing. It is considered to be part of the member cost-burden of care. Member cost-sharing is examined in the financial/economic section of each of the four reports and is discussed at greater length there. Those covered by Individual plans pay for the full cost of their insurance premiums. Individual plans were also examined during this project, but the data for them was based on far fewer lives than that for Group plans. Thus there is less confidence in the Individual results. For Individual plans, only 42 of the 45 mandates apply. These 42 mandates constitute 18% of the overall medical cost, as well as 18% of the health insurance premium for Individual plans. As for Group plans, this percentage is li kely overstated for similar reasons. As a percentage of medical cost, the member cost-sharing for Individual plans is considerably greater than Group for total cost and for the cost of the 42 mandates. For Individual plans, member cost-sharing is about 27% of the medical cost for the 42 mandates. This is somewhat lower than the cost-sharing for all benefits. According to the carrier data submitted, member cost-sharing in Individual plans is about 33% of total cost for all benefits. 530 Appendix II. For Group plans, the medical co st for the five most costly mandates is 12% of the total medical cost. That is, slightly more than half of the cost of all forty-five mandates is found in these top five. The lowest cost eighteen mandates comprise less than 0.1% of the total medical cost, which is less than one one-hundredth of the cost of the top five for Group plans. Further information about the cost of the mandates is contained in a subsequent section of this summary titled \"IV. Cost of Mandates.\" Many of the lowest cost mandates require a medi cal service or services that are utilized by extremely few individuals. An example of this is neurological testing for children undergoing chemotherapy; another is orthodontic treatment for children born with cranio-facial disorders. Even mandates that cover services utilized by a significant portion of the population might not be all that costly if the service itself is of low unit cost. For example, a test costing $30 that is performed once annually on 10% of the insured population will cost the average member $3 per year, which translates into a $0.25 medical cost per member per month, which is less than 0.1% of overall medical cost. The lowest cost mandates involve a low cost service that is utilized by very few people. In addition to cost, various socio-economic aspects of the mandates were examined. This analysis was not as easily generalized to all 45 mandates as the cost analysis. The cost of some of the mandates, such as psychotropic drugs and copayment limits on complex imaging, have been increasing at a faster rate than the rest of medical services over the past decade due to advancements in medicine. III. OVERVIEW \"Fully insured\" plans are distinguished from \"self-funded plans\" in this report. The latter are not within the purview of the mandate regulations. Self-funded plans are provided by employers, usually larger employers, to employees and their dependents. They are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA ) of 1974, not by state insurance law. As such, they are not required to cover the mandates unless it is a federal mandate also. About half of the group coverage in CT and the US is self-funded. There is no self-funded coverage for individuals; when individuals are without any health insurance coverage, they are said to be uninsured. Most self-funded groups have medical stop loss reinsurance coverage to protect themselves against 1) the risk of any covered individual's annual claims exceeding a catastrophic threshold, or 2) the group's total claims exceeding some aggregate threshold. Individuals in high deductible plans have a some what similar arrangement whereby they can be thought of as \"self-funding\" their medical costs up to the deductible, often with the use of an underlying health savings account or health reimbursement account. A. FULLY INSURED COVERAGE There are well over a million people with fully insured coverage in CT. Fully insured coverage can be obtained through group or individual health insurance plans. Almost 90% of the fully insured coverage in CT is through group policies. Individual policies tend to be purchased by those working for themselves or small groups that do not offer health coverage. They may be people between jobs, or who otherwise have no access to coverage under a group plan. Access to insurance is tantamount to access to health care. Since those with individual coverage must pay their own premium in addition to any cost-sharing required by the plan, the cost burden is greater for them than for those with group coverage. For the latter, the majority of the premium cost is generally paid by the employer. The data also showed that those 631 Appendix II.people with individual co verage incur a larger percentage of the total cost of their care in the form of deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. In the four reports, we refer to this as member cost-sharing. Unlike group coverage, new applications for Individual plans are reviewed and must pass initial underwriting of each person in order to be approved. Individual plans may impose a pre-existing exclusion on new members that will apply te mporarily. With respect to limitations for pre-existing conditions, IC considered how they would affect the mandates for Individual plans. It was concluded that they might have a short term impact on some mandates, which would be difficult to measure. However, the long term cost would not be significantly changed. Each of the mandates is discussed in the prior four reports covering Sets One through Four. Costs are examined, and socio-economic and financia l implications are discussed. In order to understand each mandate, some medical background must be understood; this is also provided in the four actuarial reports. B. SELF-FUNDED COVERAGE All self-funded coverage is group coverage; that is, it is employer-based. Some self-funded plans may consist of multiple employers. Self-funded employers tend to be larger ones. Although there are exceptions, the largest employers tend to have more comprehensive benefit plans with less member cost-sharing than smaller employer plans. Public employers, such as towns, cities, and municipalities tend to have the most generous (\"rich\") health plans. These plans tend to cover services that other plans might not. For example, they may have an unlimited benefit for chiropractic care. They may also cover hearing aids and vision care, or other such non-standard medical benefits and services. These benefits are beyond the scope of traditional Medicare Part A and Part B coverage. These public employer plans are also \"richer\" insofar as they often have lower member cost-sharing in the form of deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. Large self-funded em ployers also tend to embrace wellness and disease management programs before others because they have high stakes in the productivity of their workforce and the resources to strive to improve it. A survey was sent to the six carriers. It contained questions about the number of groups and insured members covered by each of forty of the mandates. The results were incomplete, but the data indicated that most self-funded members are covered by most of the mandates. 26 mandates, about 2/3, are included by 75% of the self-funded plans. 13 mandates, about 1/3, are included by 90% of the groups and cover 90% of the members. 9 of the 12 more expensive mandates (with cost of $1 PMPM or more) are covered by 75% of the self-funded groups and cover 77% of members. Only 5 of these 12 mandates are covered by 90% of groups and members. Some survey responses were questionable in ligh t of federal mandates that require coverage of certain mandates by self-funded groups and HIPAA privacy requirements that apply. These include Mental Health Parity, Minimum Hospital Stay following Childbirth, and Denial of Coverage to People with Elevated Blood Alcohol Content. Some state mandates are also part of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Self-funded groups will be required to cover newborn infants, as is now required of insured groups by the state mandate. Other state-required benefits are now mandated by PPACA for plans that fail to maintain \"grandfathered\" status after September 23, 2010. These 732 Appendix II. federal mandates includ e 100% coverage preventative care and direct access to obstetricians and gynecologists without a referral. It is our understanding the federal preventative care mandate would encompass the current state mandates of pediatric preventative care, screening for blood lead, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer (including mammograms). Also, some aspects of the state mandated \"birth to three\" program would fall under the federal preventative care mandate. As employers make other changes to their benefits and their share of the cost, more and more self-funded plans that were originally \"grandfathered\" will lose this status over time. When that occurs, these plans will have to add the 100% preventative care benefit (no member cost-sharing) and direct access to obstetricians and gynecologists. The carrier survey did not seek reasons why self-funded groups cover one state mandate but not another. The benefit prevalence data suggest that cost is not the driving factor as to whether a self-funded group decides to include a state-mandated benefit. Indeed, our survey indicates a higher prevalence of mandates costing over $1 PMPM than of all the mandates in total. The only two mandates with higher than $1 PMPM cost that are not covered by at least 75% of the self-funded groups are psychotropic drugs, infertility treatment, and contraceptive drugs, where religious considerations may be a factor in the decision not to cover the latter. IV. COST OF MANDATES Over the past fifty years, medical technology has made astonishing progress. Life expectancy has increased substantially, and many diseases t hat were a death sentence twenty-five or fifty years ago can now be treated and, if not cured, at least held at bay while life is extended. This technological progress shows up in the diagnosis and treatment of sickness and disease. It is also seen in medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Over the past several decades, medical cost has increased annually at a rate roughly double that of inflation. Medical technology and advancements in medicine in general have contributed to that increase, as have other factors. As explained previously in the Executive Summary, the 45 mandates in this report comprise roughly 22% of the 2010 medical cost of health insurance in CT for the average person covered by a group plan. This is the cost paid by insurers and does not include the cost paid by the member in the form of deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. As stated in the Executive Summary, this percentage, 22%, likely overstates the true cost of the mandates for several reasons. Some of the benefits required by the mandates were already covered prior to the passage of the mandate. The cost of other mandates may also be overstated for other reasons. The psychotropic drugs mandate, for example, requires health insurers to cover only the most effective psychotropic drug, but insurers reported the total cost of all psychotropic drugs. In other cases, the insurance carriers may have erred on the safe side and captured more claims for a particular mandate than the mandate requires. There is also some minor overlap in the covered services of several mandates. The medical cost of the top five mandates comprises 12% of the total medical cost for Group: Cancer, Tumors, Leukemia, etc. Mental Health and Substance Abuse Coverage Psychotropic Drugs--Most Effective Drug Diabetes Diagnosis and Treatment, Equipment and Supplies Newborn Coverage 833 Appendix II.Some of the cost for these top five was already covered prior to the passage of the mandates. The medical cost of the next five mandates comprises an additional 5% of the total medical cost for Group plans: Colorectal Cancer Screening Off-Label Use of Cancer Drugs Infertility Mammography Chiropractors The remaining 35 mandates cost 5% for Group plans. Of these 35, 29 have a medical cost of $1 per member per month (PMPM) or less; and 18 of these 29 cost $0.05 PMPM or less. The lowest cost 18 mandates represent less than 0.1% of the overall cost of medical care. The highest cost mandate is a broad-based and multifaceted one that covers cancer and has a 2010 medical paid cost of $11 PMPM. It is not a benefit that could be easily removed from a health insurance policy today, although perhaps some minor aspects of it could be. For example, the cancer mandate requires insurers to pay up to $300 for a wig following chemotherapy; this component of the cancer mandate is of de minimis cost. Similarly, other higher cost mandates, such as diabetes and mammography, are considered part of the basic package of essential benefits covered by health insurance and thus not easily removed. The member cost-sharing associated with the 45 mandates for Group plans is about 17% of their medical cost, which is about 3.7% of total medical cost (3.7% = 17% x 22%). This cost-sharing occurs in the form of deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. The member cost sharing for Individual plans is significantly greater as a percentage of total medical cost. For Group plans, the non-medical expenses associated with the mandates is about 16.7% of premium; this is about 20% of their medical cost. These non-medical expenses consist of administrative costs and profit/risk charges. Embedded in the administrative cost for fully insured plans is a premium tax charge of 1.75% of premium. There was less than one-twelfth as much carrier data for Individual plans as there was for Group. For this reason, we are less confident in the statistics calculated for Individual. In aggregate, for Individual plans, the mandates cost about 18% of medical cost. As for Group plans, this 18% may be overstated. For Individual plans, the member cost-sharing on the mandates is about 27% of the medical cost, whic h is equal to 4.9% of overall medical cost (4.9% = 27% x 18%). This is greater than for Group. As a percentage of Allowed cost for all health care services, Individual plans typically require about twice as much member cost- sharing as Group. This is explained in each of the four reports. Individual plans typically charge a greater percentage of premium for administrative cost and profit than Group plans; this means that non-medical expense, as a percentage of medical cost, is generally greater for Individual than Group. For Individual plans, the non-medical expenses associated with the mandates is about 30% of their medical cost. These are administrative costs and profit, also called retention in the four reports. As a percent of medical cost, both member cost-sharing and retention are greater for Individual plans than Group. The first two of the following appendices contain per member per month (PMPM) cost data for Group plans. The first shows various 2010 costs of each of the 45 mandates as explained in 934 Appendix II. the four reports. The se cond is a five year summary that shows paid medical cost only for each of the 45 mandates projected from 2010 through 2014. The third appendix shows 2010 PMPM costs for Individual plans; these cost estimates are less reliable than those of Group. The fourth appendix shows the total cost for Group and Individual combined, with and without cost-sharing and retention; underlying assumptions are noted on the appendix. The fifth appendix shows the results of the self-funded survey. Although all six carriers responded to it, one gave numerical answers for only five of the mandates.
