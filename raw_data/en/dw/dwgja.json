By mixing the wisdom of traditional Chinese Medicine with advanced research and providing long lasting, holistic comfort to those with restless skin problems through our products and ongoing consultation. The 3HX Formula is In The Heart of Everything We Do The ground-breaking 3HX formula, which has proven astounding benefits to the skin by supporting a healthy cell production inside and out. The complex process, which took a decade to perfect, allows for the extraction of the active ingredients within the herbs, which have then been used to create products that offer safe and effective results. For People Who Don't Believe We believe there can be better, safer and effective solutions to people who suffer from chronic skin conditions. For the ones who tried everything and have come to the frustrated point of \"this is how it is\". We want to prove to them there is a better long lasting natural solution. It Started by Accident It all started by accident on a flight to San Francisco. One of our teammates, Nadav, realized the rash he had was more than just an itch. It was a complicated skin condition called psoriasis. Nadav's search for a solution led him deep into traditional Chinese medicine. But it also put him in contact with respected doctors in the West. He was convinced the way forward lay in harmonizing the two sciences. Eventually, Nadav set up a team in a state-of-the-art lab in France to put the most powerful traditional remedies he'd discovered to the test of modern science. The work they did in the lab would earn the Medovie team 17 patents over the next 10 years. Those 17 patents told them they had a skincare product worth sharing with the world. A Team of Scientists, Doctors, Clinical Researchers Management wonks and digital creatives from around the world who came together to find real solutions for serious skin problems. Along the way, we realized something that changed our lives. With the right tech and the right customer care, we could do more than pioneer safer, more effective skincare products. We could actually build a community for many people (just like us) who struggle with skin conditions that have upended their lives.
